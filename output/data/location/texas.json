    "fullText": "The recent airspace closure around El Paso, Texas, was caused by the U.S. Military shooting down a party balloon amid a behind-the-scenes spat with air safety officials, multiple reports say.\n\nThat contradicts the explanation provided on Tuesday by administration officials, which claimed the closure was necessary because drones operated by Mexican drug cartels were being downed as they crossed the southern border.\n\nFlights at the El Paso International Airport were grounded and inbound planes, including medical evacuation flights, were forced to divert 45 minutes away to Las Cruces, New Mexico, said the border city’s enraged mayor.\n\n“I want to be very, very clear that this should’ve never happened,” Mayor Renard Johnson said in a news conference on Wednesday. “You cannot restrict air space over a major city without coordinating with the city, the airport, the hospitals, the community leadership... That failure to communicate is unacceptable.”\n\nSources tell CBS News the dramatic shoot-down and airspace closure “stemmed from disagreements between the Federal Aviation Administration and Pentagon officials over drone-related tests,” suggesting friction between federal officials and the military.\n\nThe network’s sources said that Fort Bliss, which abuts the city’s airport, received new laser technology that the Pentagon, led by Defense Secretary Pete Hegeth, was itching to test ASAP to practice taking down drones.\n\nThe FAA, meanwhile, wished to hold meetings on “over safety impacts” scheduled for later this month, CBS reports. Sources also told The New York Times that the FAA had “concerns about the risks” the new anti-drone tech “could pose to other aircraft in the area.”\n\nNeither the Pentagon nor the FAA responded to requests for comment. Mexican officials say they have seen no evidence that a drone was shot down at the border.\n\nAirspace was initially announced as shut down in El Paso for 10 days, an unusual period for a commercial airport of that size, but it was reopened early Wednesday after it was determined there were no credible threats to air travel.",

    "description": "A Pentagon plan to use a high-energy, counter-drone laser without having coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration about potential risks to civilian flights prompted Wednesday’s unprecedented airspace shutdown over El Paso, Texas, multiple sources tell CNN.",
    "fullText": "A Pentagon plan to use a high-energy, counter-drone laser without having coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration about potential risks to civilian flights prompted Wednesday’s unprecedented airspace shutdown over El Paso, Texas, multiple sources told CNN.\n\nA source familiar with the timeline of events said that the US military used the laser technology to shoot down four mylar balloons this week, contributing to the decision by the FAA to shut down local airspace.\n\nThose accounts come as the Trump administration has claimed that a Mexican cartel drone crossing into US airspace is what triggered the 10-mile restriction centered on El Paso International Airport.\n\nLate Tuesday, the FAA abruptly issued a temporary flight restriction that immediately grounded all flights up to 18,000 feet around the city for 10 days, effectively shutting down El Paso International Airport.\n\nRoughly eight hours later, the restriction was lifted. By the time the FAA had lifted the flight restrictions, airlines had already issued travel waivers and notified customers of potential changes.\n\nMultiple sources from the federal government and US airlines told CNN that military activity near El Paso, including US drones monitoring cartel operations and the Pentagon’s planned use of a high-energy laser designed to counter drones, raised immediate concerns for civilian traffic arriving and departing El Paso International Airport. Fort Bliss and its airfield, Biggs Army Airfield, sit just north of the commercial airport, which serves about 100 flights each day.\n\nFAA and Pentagon officials had been scheduled to meet February 20 to review potential impacts and mitigation measures for a test of the laser system, a technology the Pentagon has been testing in more remote areas of the country, multiple sources said. But the Defense Department sought to use the system sooner around El Paso, prompting the FAA to impose the temporary flight restriction until that coordination could occur. The 10-day restriction would have expired on February 21, one day after DoD and the FAA were set to meet.\n\nThe FAA’s decision to close the airspace was made without telling the White House first, according to people familiar with the matter. The issue became a topic of intense focus inside the West Wing in the early morning hours of Wednesday, as Texas lawmakers pressed for answers on why the airspace was suddenly closed without first alerting them.\n\nAn administration official said Wednesday morning that the shutdown was triggered by Defense Department “action to disable” cartel drones. It’s unclear if the presence of drones might have led to the acceleration of the deployment of the laser system.\n\nCNN reached out to the FAA and White House for comment about the differing explanations. The Pentagon on Wednesday continued to refer to the administration official’s statement about a drone breach having caused the airspace closure.\n\nSecretary of Transportation Sean Duffy posted to social media crediting the FAA and Defense Department with acting “swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion.”\n\n“The threat has been neutralized, and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region,” he wrote on X.\n\nIncursions along the southern border are extremely common and historically do not prompt such airspace closures. In 2024, for example, Air Force Gen. Greg Guillot, the commander of NORTHCOM, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the number of incursions along the US Mexico border was “over a thousand” each month.\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration and other US security agencies have used facilities at the Biggs Army Airfield for years as part of efforts to monitor Mexico-based drug cartel operations, current and former US officials said.\n\nEl Paso, with a population of nearly 700,000, is the sixth-largest city in Texas and one of the 25 largest in the United States. It is a hub of cross-border commerce alongside neighboring Ciudad Juárez in Mexico.\n\nNearly 3.5 million passengers passed through El Paso International Airport in the first 11 months of 2025, according to its website. The airport describes itself as the gateway to West Texas, southern New Mexico and northern Mexico.\n\nThe US military has been testing laser-based air defenses against drones in recent months. Last summer, the Army conducted a live-fire exercise using directed energy weapons alongside more traditional air defense systems at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. And last fall, the Army put out a request to industry for ideas on a counter-drone Enduring-High Energy Laser (E-HEL) weapon system.\n\nIn the initial flight restrictions, the FAA classified the area around El Paso﻿ as “(National) Defense Airspace” and said pilots who violated the restriction could be intercepted, detained and questioned by law enforcement.\n\nIt warned that additional actions could be taken for pilots who don’t adhere to the restrictions, including suspension of flight certifications, criminal charges, and that the US government “may use deadly force” if an aircraft poses an “imminent security threat.”\n\nThe sudden FAA restrictions seemed to catch pilots and air traffic controllers by surprise.\n\nAudio from LiveATC.net caught the moment pilots were made aware of the grounding.\n\n“Just pass it on to everybody else, at 06:30 for the next 10 days, we’re all at a ground stop,” a controller said.\n\nA pilot replied, “OK, ground stop 06:30 for how long?”\n\n“Ten days,” the controller replied.\n\n“So the airport is totally closed?” the pilot said, chuckling.\n\nThe controller replied, “Apparently, we just got informed about 30 minutes to an hour ago.”\n\n“So for 10 days you guys are not open,” the pilot said, in disbelief.\n\n“Well, we’ll be here, but no air traffic,” the controller said.\n\n“OK,” the pilot said while laughing.\n\nSamuel, a traveler in El Paso, told CNN affiliate KFOX he was doing a book tour with a client and didn’t get any notification from his airline.\n\n“I just kind of saw all the cops here and the news cameras,” he said. “I gotta figure out what’s going on if there’s another airport that’s not in El Paso, and try to figure out and rent a car out.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas told reporters Wednesday that the closure of the El Paso International Airport was solely a FAA decision and that local officials — including members of Congress — were left completely in the dark before it happened.\n\nShe stressed that she was not notified in advance despite representing the congressional district that’s home to the airport, Fort Bliss and the broader El Paso community.\n\n“They did not alert the El Paso city manager or the El Paso mayor,” Escobar said on a press call Wednesday morning. “Everyone locally on the ground was in the dark, and the impact, obviously, is highly consequential.”\n\nThe Associated Press and CNN’s Evan Perez, Kevin Liptak, Kit Mayer, Camila DeChalus, Karina Tsui, and Diego Mendoza contributed to this report.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments.",

    "fullText": "The US military intercepted Mexican cartel drones that breached US airspace, a Trump administration official said on Wednesday, explaining why the government made the rare decision to temporarily restrict flights over El Paso.\n\nThe official told Business Insider that \"Mexican cartel drones breached US airspace,\" adding that the Pentagon \"took action to disable the drones.\"\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and Pentagon \"have determined there is no threat to commercial travel,\" the official added.\n\nIt's unclear how the US military disabled the cartel drones — whether they were shot down or jammed with electronic warfare technology — or if they were carrying any drugs. The Pentagon declined to provide additional information about the incident.\n\nA social media account for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, which advises Pentagon leadership on cutting-edge technology, published a photo showing what appears to be a laser destroying a small drone with the caption \"defend the homeland,\" suggesting that directed energy may have been involved in the El Paso incident.\n\nFort Bliss, a major US Army installation in El Paso, could not immediately be reached for comment on the incident.\n\nCartels in Latin America have a history of using drones for drug-related operations, including for smuggling.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a social media post that the FAA and Pentagon \"acted swiftly\" to address what he described as a \"cartel drone incursion.\"\n\nThe FAA earlier issued a surprise notice shutting down the airspace above El Paso, a major city in west Texas on the US-Mexico border, and halting all flights up to 18,000 feet for 10 days due to \"special security reasons.\" The restricted area covered a 10-mile radius.\n\nThe restrictions went into effect from 11:30 p.m. MT on Tuesday and were scheduled to last until the same time on February 20. The FAA warned that the US \"may use deadly force\" if an aircraft became \"an imminent security threat.\" It did not offer more details about the situation.\n\nRep. Veronica Escobar, whose congressional district includes El Paso, called the FAA's decision \"unprecedented.\"\n\nHowever, the FAA said shortly before 7 a.m. MT on Wednesday that the temporary airspace closure over El Paso had been lifted, adding that \"all flights will resume as normal.\" The agency did not share additional details about the bizarre, hourslong incident, which appeared to catch local lawmakers by surprise.\n\nIn recent years, access to drones has become easier for both state and non-state actors, prompting Western militaries to explore low-cost methods to counter them, including both kinetic and electronic technologies.\n\nThese concerns are top of mind among Western countries following a string of drone incursions across Europe near the end of 2025, during which Russian drones violated the airspace of multiple NATO states and unidentified drones were spotted above critical infrastructure — including airports — in other allied countries.",

    "description": "What is next for this beloved lake?",
    "fullText": "Water resources are tight in the Texas Hill Country - there's no doubt about it. But what's still in question is how the region will yet again face historic lows amid another dry start to the year, as business owners, boaters and other recreational users cautiously look forward to spring break and the peak summer season, especially as new water-reliant developments continue to target the area.\n\nIn April 2025, Medina Lake, located in Bandera and Medina counties, reached \"dead pool\" status, according to Dave Mauck, general manager of the Bandera County River Authority & Groundwater District, meaning that water levels had dropped so low that downstream flow had completely ceased. Lake levels then were at just 2.5 percent of the lake's capacity.\n\nAs of Friday, February 6, water levels have risen marginally, standing now at 4.4 percent full following a 2025 high: a modest 6.5 percent shortly after the Hill Country experienced deadly flooding on July 4, 2025.\n\nAccording to data from the Texas Water Development Board, the lake's surface elevation level is 978.57 feet above sea level. The lake's full capacity should hold 1,064.2 feet of water, a difference of about 86 feet.\n\nThe lake has been disappearing for years now; satellite images from more than a decade ago show it slowly regressing, and drought conditions have only gotten worse.\n\nThe Bandera County River Authority & Groundwater District currently lists its drought level as \"exceptional,\" and on Thursday, February 5, the agency issued new water restrictions limiting irrigation and well use. The Bexar-Medina-Atascosa Water Control and Improvement District No. 1, which also manages the lake, is currently under Stage 4 water restrictions.\n\n\"It's just been so dry for so long,\" Mauck told MySA last October.\n\nMauck, who could not be reached immediately for comment, has previously told MySA that the lake's low water levels have far-reaching effects on various stakeholders, including businesses that depend on the lake's tourist appeal, farmers relying on water for irrigation, and homeowners and newcomers in need of this vital resource as the Hill Country's population continues to grow.\n\nThis article originally published at Is a dying Texas Hill Country lake returning to 'dead pool' status?

    "description": "Aaron Reitz, who is running for Texas attorney general, issued the threat after an interview of Wu was shared online of him discussing non-white voting strength.",
    "fullText": "Aaron Reitz, among the GOP candidates running to be Texas Attorney General, on Monday suggested without evidence that the leader of the Texas House Democrats, who is Asian, had lied during his citizenship application process and should have his citizenship revoked.\n\n“As AG, I want to see [Rep. Gene Wu] de-naturalized,” he posted on X in a response to a 28-second clip of an interview of Wu talking years ago about racial divisions in the country.\n\nThe clipping, from a 2024 interview, instantly infuriated some Texas Republicans who accused Wu, a Houston Democrat, of being anti-White and racist, for his suggestion that non-white communities could come together to win elections in Texas once they realized “they share the same oppressor.”\n\nReitz is facing three others for the GOP nomination in the March 3 primary: state Sens. Joan Huffman of Houston and Mayes Middleton of Galveston as well as U.S. Rep. Chip Roy of Austin. He appeared to be the only candidate offering to take action against Wu for his comments.\n\n“On what basis? He likely concealed his anti-American sentiment throughout his citizenship app process—the details of which are conspicuously absent from the public record,” Reitz wrote on social media. “Wu is a subversive whose citizenship should be revoked.”\n\nThrough a spokesperson, Wu declined to comment.\n\nDenaturalizations are historically rare, and under federal law, can only occur if someone committed fraud while applying for citizenship. The federal government can also denaturalize someone if they become affiliated with the Communist Party, or a terrorist organization within a few years of becoming a citizen.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has increasingly pointed to denaturalizations as a means to increase his crackdown on immigrants. Last year, the administration issued guidance to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services field offices, issuing monthly quotas for offices to initiate denaturalization cases.\n\nThe video clipping that went viral shows Wu talking about relationships between different immigrant communities. The entire interview, nearly 40 minutes long, features a conversation about Texas’ GOP leadership, life in Texas for immigrants and Wu’s own life, from when he migrated as a child from China with his family to seeing the Asian American community in Houston flourish.\n\n“I always tell people the day the Latino, African American, Asian and other communities realize that they share the same oppressor is the day we start winning,” Wu says in the short clipping circulating social media. “We have the ability to take over this country and to do what is needed for everyone and to make things fair. But the problem is our communities are divided.”\n\nThe video was posted Saturday evening by an X account with nearly 4 million followers. A few hours later it was reposted by LibsofTikTok, the right wing disinformation account with almost 5 million followers.\n\nU.S. Sen. Ted Cruz said the “Democrat party is built on bigotry.” Paxton called Wu a “radical racist who hates millions of Texans just because they’re white.”\n\nRoy, in a heated primary contest against Reitz, said Wu should resign from his state House seat, a move other conservative influencers and commentators also encouraged.\n\n“Unlike many Democrats, he admits his racism against white people and call to ‘take over this country,’” Roy wrote on social media. “He should resign or the TX House should strip him of any power.”\n\nBo French, the former Tarrant County GOP chair running for a seat on the Texas Railroad Commission, referred to Wu as a “commie,” even as Wu has shared personal stories of how his family was the victim of the Chinese communist party.\n\nTexas Republicans in the Capitol and beyond have for years baselessly accused Wu of similar offenses, and questioned his loyalty to the state and country. The criticism reached a new peak last summer when Wu and other House Democrats left the state to delay the passage of a new congressional map aimed to max GOP gains in the U.S. House.\n\nTwo lawsuits seeking to remove Wu from office for breaking quorum remain pending before the state’s supreme court.\n\nAt one point in the interview where the viral clip came from, Wu talks about how he sees all the residents in his district as Americans, regardless of their legal status. The journalist host then asks Wu about his biggest fears for Houston’s undocumented population during Trump’s second term, secured with promises of a historic deportation effort.\n\n“It’s not just the fate of undocumented people. It’s the fate of all immigrants,” Wu responds, pointing to the internment of 120,000 Japanese Americans during World War II. “People say I’m not worried. I’m a citizen. … When the mass deportation begins, I promise you it will not just be illegal immigrants who are affected. It will be Americans.”",

    "fullText": "Texas Department of Transportation officials have announced two new highway projects that will cause traffic slowdowns in deep South Texas - one, for just a couple of weeks, and another for the next seven months.\n\nDrivers in Hidalgo and Cameron County, in the Rio Grande Valley, are going to want to remain alert in the coming days as TxDOT crews work to install fencing and repave the surface of two major highways.\n\nOver in Cameron County, drivers in the largest city in the Valley will see a number of overnight lane and ramp closures as TxDOT spends the next seven months resurfacing Interstate 69E right in the heart of Brownsville.\n\n\"The overall scope of work, which includes removal of the top layer of asphalt, new pavement overlay and new pavement markings, is expected to be completed by August 2026,\" TxDOT officials said.\n\nBeginning Sunday, February 8, TxDOT crews will work overnight from 9 a.m. to 6 a.m. to resurface approximately eight miles of the most heavily-travelled freeway in Brownsville. The freeway lane and ramp closures will take place from Ruben M. Torres Boulevard on the city's north side, south to the junction with Texas 4, the state highway that leads to the city of Starbase. That section of I-69E spans six travel lanes, plus frontage roads, and runs through Brownsville's bustling Sunrise Mall retail corridor, near its downtown arts district, and some of its densest residential sectors.\n\nBeginning Monday, February 9, TxDOT will be closing lanes on both northbound and southbound Interstate 69-C north of the city of Edinburg. The lane closures will affect a 3-mile stretch of highway from the U.S. Business 281 junction north to Farm-to-Market Road 2812. Lanes will remain closed from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., TxDOT said.\n\n\"Crews will be installing metal beam guard fence to enhance safety on this segment of I-69C. Work is expected to be completed in approximately two weeks,\" TxDOT officials said. \"Drivers should expect delays and are advised to stay alert and watch out for workers in the construction zones.\"\n\nTxDOT is slowly working to transform U.S. 281 into part of a three-pronged I-69 corridor. The central prong, I-69C, is a critical corridor for traffic entering or leaving Valley since it is the only route for both passenger and commercial traffic traveling through Hidalgo County. The section of the highway that will be subject to lane closures over the next two weeks consists of two main travel lanes in each direction, improved shoulders, a wide grassy median dotted with the Valley's iconic Washingtonia palms, and frontage road lanes.\n\nThis article originally published at TxDOT warns of long-term closure plaguing South Texas highway.",

    "fullText": "HOUSTON (AP) — The final two of nearly 30 civil lawsuits that Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson had faced from women accusing him of sexual misconduct have been dismissed, according to court records.\n\nThe dismissal of these two lawsuits clears Watson of legal problems he had been facing since 2021 after 27 women came forward and accused him in court filings in Texas of exposing himself, touching them with his genitals or kissing them against their will, mostly during massage appointments.\n\nSome of the women alleged Watson, 30, forced them to perform oral sex and one woman accused him of sexually assaulting her.\n\nThe dismissals come as both lawsuits had been set to go to trial in the next few weeks. The accusations against Watson were made when he played for the Houston Texans.\n\nIt is believed that Watson has no other lawsuits pending in connection with the sexual misconduct allegations.\n\nOne of the lawsuits that was dismissed on Friday has been settled, said Tony Buzbee, the attorney for the woman who had filed it. Buzbee declined to comment further, citing confidentiality of the settlement agreement. Buzbee's client alleged Watson touched her with his penis multiple times during a massage session.\n\nIt was not immediately known if the other dismissed lawsuit had also been settled. Anissah Nguyen, an attorney for the woman who filed the lawsuit, didn’t immediately respond to an email or call seeking comment. Nguyen's client had accused Watson of pressuring her to perform oral sex during a massage.\n\nWatson’s attorneys declined to comment.\n\nWatson, who was traded to the Browns in March 2022, has long denied any wrongdoing, and two separate Texas grand juries declined to indict him. One of his attorneys, Rusty Hardin, had previously said the allegations against Watson were “meritless.”\n\n“I don’t remember or recall any sexual encounters with her,” Watson said in a 2023 deposition he gave while being questioned about the woman represented by Nguyen.\n\nThe woman represented by Nguyen had also sued the Houston Texans, alleging Watson had assaulted women with the help and resources of the team. The lawsuit against the Texans was also dismissed last week.\n\nA spokesperson for the Texans didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nIn July 2022, 30 women who had accused the Texans of turning a blind eye to allegations against their former star quarterback settled their legal claims against the team.\n\nIt was not unusual that all the cases against Watson were settled, said David Ring, a California-based attorney who is not connected to the lawsuits and who has represented victims of sexual assault. He said the majority of civil lawsuits are typically resolved before going to trial and that high-profile defendants typically don’t want cases to play out in a public courtroom.\n\n“He’s trying to put all of this behind him,” Ring said.\n\nWatson’s legal problems began after dozens of women claimed to have been the victims of sexual misconduct or assault between 2017 and 2020.\n\nMost of the lawsuits against Watson were settled in 2022.\n\nFollowing the allegations, Watson was suspended for the first 11 games in 2022 for violating the league’s personal conduct policy.\n\nWatson was also fined $5 million and underwent a mandatory evaluation before being reinstated by the league. He has played in only 19 games for the Browns due to the NFL suspension and injuries.\n\nFollow Juan A. Lozano: https://x.com/juanlozano70",

    "description": "Bolt Data and Energy was recently cofounded by Eric Schmidt and raised $150 million. Now it's in talks to have Google anchor Texas campus.",
    "fullText": "Bolt Data and Energy, a data center development firm that was cofounded late last year by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, is negotiating a deal that would allow it to begin construction on a large data center project it is planning in West Texas.\n\nSchmidt's firm is in discussions with Google, his former employer, according to two people with direct knowledge of the talks. The tech giant, one of the leaders in the race to develop and commercialize artificial intelligence, is considering a commitment of 250 megawatts, according to one of the people. The other person said it was too early to characterize the exact size of the potential transaction because it was still under discussion.\n\nThe sources spoke on the condition of anonymity because the potential transaction is still being arranged and the talks are confidential.\n\n\"We don't comment on rumors,\" a Google spokeswoman told Business Insider, declining to comment further. Google announced last year that it plans to build $40 billion of cloud and AI infrastructure in Texas by 2027.\n\nThe potential deal highlights how Big Tech is racing to secure the power, physical infrastructure, and land needed to fuel AI, even as the costs and financial risks of those bets loom.\n\nIn December, Bolt completed its first funding round, raising $150 million from investors, including $50 million from Texas Pacific Land Corporation, a public company that owns large tracts of land in West Texas. As part of the investment from TPL, Bolt will develop data centers on land in TPL's portfolio.\n\nA presentation detailing Bolt's development plans, shared with Business Insider, said that TPL's land would give it access to abundant power and water for cooling. These commodities have become increasingly strained as data center development has boomed around the country.\n\nThe presentation states that Bolt's development would begin with an \"initial 250 megawatt facility\" and expand in 250-500 megawatt increments into a 5 gigawatt campus.\n\nBolt's plan is one of several large-scale projects that have been envisioned in Texas to cater to the AI race. Fermi, a public company co-founded by former Texas governor and US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, has plans for an 11-gigawatt campus in Amarillo.\n\nIn December, Business Insider revealed that Amazon had pulled back a $150 million cash advance it had pledged as part of a preliminary deal to anchor the project. Fermi's disclosure of the reimbursement of that advance caused its stock to fall by 50%. Fermi's CEO, Toby Neugebauer, told Business Insider that although Amazon had reclaimed its advance, the negotiations for it to take space with Fermi were still ongoing.\n\nMajor bank lenders who extended $38 billion to finance the construction of data center campuses in Shackleford County, Texas, and Port Washington, Wisconsin, for Oracle and OpenAI, meanwhile, have had difficulty selling off pieces of the huge loan to other banks and investors. Those troubles stem, in part, from worries about whether Oracle's credit will be strained by its massive AI spending.\n\nTo help allay concerns, Oracle announced it would raise as much as $50 billion in debt and equity in 2026 to continue to pursue its AI buildout while also maintaining \"a solid investment-grade balance sheet.\"\n\nLast week, Alphabet, Google's parent company, revealed in its fourth-quarter earnings report that it plans to spend between $175 and $185 billion on capital expenditures in 2026, roughly double its outlay in 2025. The spending is being done largely to pay for AI equipment and infrastructure.\n\nA record wave of spending has been announced by big technology companies on AI this year, including Amazon's disclosure during its earnings last week that it would spend $200 billion alone this year.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Recruiting for SpaceX in South Texas is particularly difficult, he said: “It’s like a technology monastery thing, remote and mostly dudes.”",
    "fullText": "California still has it over Texas in at least one key way, Elon Musk says: Hiring.\n\nAfter moving the headquarters of SpaceX and Tesla Inc. to Texas in recent years because of politics, he said it’s still easier to recruit employees to work in California. With one exception.\n\n“Austin, it helps,” Musk said — while noting that Tesla still has most of its engineering capacity in California. “Getting engineers to move … I call it the significant other problem.”\n\nThat’s what makes engineering recruiting toughest at Starbase, the remote South Texas outpost where SpaceX is developing its Starship mega-rocket.\n\n“For Starbase that was particularly difficult, since the odds of finding a non-SpaceX job are pretty low,” Musk said. “It’s quite difficult. It’s like a technology monastery thing, remote and mostly dudes.”\n\nSpouses, he said, are often unwilling to relocate to the isolated area.\n\nMusk companies also have operations in Robstown McGregor, Bastrop and elsewhere across the state.\n\nHe disclosed the issues on the Cheeky Pint podcast during a chat in which he also accused tech giant Apple Inc. of trying to poach Tesla’s talent when that company was working on its own self-driving electric car, a project it later scrapped.\n\n“They were carpet bombing Tesla with recruiting calls,” Musk said. He claimed their opening offer would be roughly double the compensation at Tesla, indicating what he referred to as a “Tesla pixie dust” factor, in which other companies assume if they could hire someone from Tesla, the employee would put them on track to success.\n\n“When we had the pixie dust problem, we would get relentlessly recruited from,” Musk said. “Also, Tesla being engineering, especially being primarily in Silicon Valley, it’s easier for people to just… They don’t have to change their life very much. Their commute’s going to be the same.”\n\nREAD NEXT: Elon Musk and Jeffrey Epstein had closer ties than disclosed, newly released files show\n\nJohn Collison, co-founder of Stripe and podcast host, asked Musk how he guards against poachers. Musk said there’s not much that can stop it.\n\nMusk has long been trying to draw tech talent to Texas, with a renewed push after last week’s announcement that SpaceX acquired xAI. Days after giving notice of the plan, Michael Nicolls, vice president of Starlink engineering, said the SpaceX-owned satellite company is hiring for critical engineering roles to develop technologies for AI satellites in space at the company’s facilities in Austin and Seattle.",

    "title": "‘Disaster waiting to happen': Fracking boom put hundreds of tanks in Guadalupe River floodplain",
    "description": "Lack of a state floodplain policy in Texas enabled oil companies to build in areas hit by an epic inundation less than 30 years ago.",
    "fullText": "GONZALES - More than 500 enormous oil tanks dot the floodplains of the Guadalupe River and its tributaries across one of Texas' leading oil fields, posing risk of environmental disaster in a flood climatologists say is almost certain to come.\n\nLongtime residents of this area's historic ranchlands vividly remember the last time these plains filled with water, in a biblical inundation in 1998. But that was before the fracking boom that hit the region because of the oil-rich geological formation that lies beneath it, known as the Eagle Ford Shale.\n\nToday, a repeat of the historic flood could wreak havoc, an Inside Climate News investigation has found.\n\n\"There's a whole lot of tanks full of oil that are going to float away,\" said Sara Dubose, a fifth-generation landowner in Gonzales County with 10 tanks in the floodplain on her family's ranchlands, each holding up to 21,000 gallons of oil or toxic wastewater. \"Spill all over our land and ruin it for 100 years.\"\n\nAlmost 20 feet of water could submerge some of the tanks on the Dubose family's land in a flooding event similar to 1998, according to an analysis of data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nInside Climate News scoured satellite imagery of the area to identify batteries of oil tanks and other oil field infrastructure in the Eagle Ford Shale near waterways in the Guadalupe River Basin. Using latitude and longitude coordinates of each tank battery, the analysis used FEMA flood mapping data to extract the agency's estimates for the depths of its benchmark flood scenarios at each location.\n\nIn some areas, the 1998 flood exceeded the worst-case scenario considered by disaster planners. FEMA calls it the \"500-year flood,\" a hypothetical event the agency estimates has a 0.2% chance of happening in any year.\n\nToday, a 500-year flood across the entire area analyzed would cover at least 22 tank batteries containing 144 individual oil and wastewater tanks with 10 or more feet of water. Of those, 12 tanks would sit beneath at least 20 feet of water.\n\nFEMA's estimates for a 500-year flood understate present risk in many locations, research shows, as warming air and oceans continue to fuel an intensification of extreme rainfall.\n\nDubose experienced the 1998 flood, when the Guadalupe River sprang from its banks and filled the shallow valleys at the edge of these coastal plains. The water almost reached her house, 7 miles from the river, where it trapped her for a week, covering U.S. 183 in both directions as it drained slowly into San Antonio Bay on the coast.\n\nIn a warming world with more intense rainfall, a future flood could be even more severe.\n\n\"One day, it's going to happen,\" Dubose said. \"We've all been concerned about the oil field flooding.\"\n\nWhen flooding hit a smaller oil field in 2013 in northeastern Colorado, authorities tallied two dozen overturned tanks and almost 90,000 gallons of oil and wastewater spilled. During Hurricane Katrina in 2005, millions of gallons of oil spilled when several supersized storage tanks floated off their pads. In 1994, flooding on the San Jacinto River in East Texas severed eight pipelines, ignited massive fires, injured hundreds of people and released more than 2 million gallons of petroleum products.\n\nLast summer, severe flooding in the Texas Hill Country near Kerrville washed away a girls' summer camp and killed more than 100 people along the Guadalupe River, 150 miles upstream from the Eagle Ford Shale.\n\nThe rules for building in floodplains in Texas fall to county governments, often small and rural. The 78 tank batteries in the Guadalupe floodplains analyzed all sit within Gonzales and DeWitt counties, which have a combined population of about 40,000 people.\n\nIt was left to the governments of the two counties to design and implement floodplain policies during the shale oil boom.\n\n\"Those are not issues that most counties, on an individual basis, are well suited to handle,\" said Todd Votteler, former executive manager of science, intergovernmental relations and policy at the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority. \"It raises a question of how serious the state is about avoiding future flood damage in high-risk areas if we don't have a statewide policy.\"\n\nTank batteries at well sites aren't typically secured to the ground by anything but the weight of the equipment and the oil and wastewater inside them. While they are especially vulnerable, they aren't the only industry infrastructure that could be affected by flooding. Eight oil pipelines and about two dozen gas pipelines also cross the Guadalupe River in the Eagle Ford Shale, and others cross local creeks.\n\nThe batteries in the floodplain on Dubose's property were previously operated by Canadian firm Baytex Energy, which sold all of its Eagle Ford Shale assets in November for $3.2 billion to an undisclosed buyer. Other operators with numerous batteries in the floodplains include EOG Resources, Devon Energy and Burlington Resources, a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips. None of those companies responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe floodplains also contain many open and buried pits of drilling waste. Dubose unsuccessfully sued an oil company in 2018, alleging that the unlined pit where it buried drilling mud and wastewater on her property was responsible for the orange, gassy goo that seeped up from the earth during heavy rainfall.\n\n\"Think about all the stuff that's soaked into the ground,\" said David Muir, a fifth-generation landowner with more than a dozen wells on his property. \"They've got thousands of chemicals that go into the drilling mud.\"\n\nMuir's land has been in his family since the 1840s. Outside his old, single-story ranch house near the border of Gonzales and DeWitt counties, a private airplane hangar and a waterpark-style swimming pool commemorate the riches fracking has brought to the region.\n\nInside the house between clamoring dogs, Muir sifted through boxes of photos that predated the shale boom. He pulled out strips of 11 film photos taped together to show the vast landscape of water that overtook this rolling savannah on the morning of Oct. 17, 1998.\n\nIt rose far past the tops of the trees. It even covered a spot on Muir's land where a tank battery now stands, 1.5 miles from the Guadalupe River.\n\n\"I thought the whole world was going to flood,\" he said as he flipped through the old pictures. \"We haven't had a flood like that since the oil field hit us.\"\n\nIt all seemed to happen in minutes, recalled Ben Prause, a former elected executive of DeWitt County who presided during the flood. The water wasn't even raging but almost calm as it swiftly rose up to swallow about two-thirds of the town of Cuero. In one case, he said, sheriff's deputies entered a home with water to their knees to save an old woman. When they walked out minutes later, the water was at their chests.\n\n\"It was so rapid,\" said Prause, 92, at his home in downtown Cuero, a few blocks from the 1998 waterline. \"It was just terrible. Water was everywhere.\"\n\nIt wasn't just the Guadalupe River, he said. Several major tributaries also flooded to make the situation worse. Torrential rains hit the upper reaches of Plum Creek and Sandies Creek, which both gushed simultaneously into the Guadalupe.\n\n\"What made it so bad is they all hit about the same time,\" he said.\n\nThese creeks barely trickle for most of the year, said Prause, a 1950 graduate of Cuero High School, but on rare occasions their large floodplains fill.\n\nIn 1998 the floodwaters south of Gonzales were several miles wide, said a report issued the next year by the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority and FEMA, exceeding predicted worst-case scenarios in some areas.\n\n\"It was the flood that many thought would never happen,\" the report said. \"Unfortunately, an even greater flood will occur sometime in the future.\"\n\nThe 1998 flood caused a few oil spills, said James Dodson, 71, co-founder of the San Antonio Bay Partnership and the son of a South Texas pipeline technician. His late wife worked for Texas' environmental regulator and spent weeks overseeing cleanups. But the extent of oil field infrastructure at that time was nothing compared with today.\n\n\"That was long before the Eagle Ford Shale plays came along,\" he said. \"The landscape was so much different in that regard - there's so many more facilities and well pads now.\"\n\nToday, along one eastward turn in the Guadalupe's snaking course, three batteries consisting of 15 tanks would sit under about 20 feet of water in a 500-year flood. One of them, operated by EOG Resources, is just 500 feet from the riverbank.\n\nTwo miles from the Guadalupe River, four tanks operated by Burlington Resources would take on almost 23 feet of water.\n\nNear Boggy Creek, east of the Guadalupe River by the small town of Dreyer, 10 feet of water would cover EOG Resources' Shiner Hub gas processing plant, a complex of 14 tanks, pipes, motors, chemical separators and flares.\n\nAlong Peach Creek, southeast of Gonzales, batteries of 12 and 28 tanks previously operated by Baytex Energy would sit under 13 feet and 8 feet of water, respectively.\n\nThe oil from toppled tanks probably wouldn't spill onto the land around them, said Dodson, a former water department director for the city of Corpus Christi who worked South Texas oil fields in the 1970s. Instead, he predicted, it would float on the water and end up at the edge of the flood's crest, like the rings in a bathtub. More of it, he said, would wash over the creeks and estuaries of San Antonio Bay and into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\"It's a disaster waiting to happen,\" said Sister Elizabeth Riebschlager, an 89-year-old Catholic nun from Cuero. \"They have these oil wells all through these areas that flooded like it's no problem.\"\n\nThe oil field infrastructure dates back less than 20 years to the shale revolution, when innovations in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing unleashed an explosion of new oil exploration.\n\nBack then, Riebschlager, the daughter of a local civic leader, conducted town hall meetings for local families baffled by the swarm of businessmen and lawyers descending on their sleepy countryside, whipping up 100-page contracts and casually writing checks for mind-boggling sums.\n\nMany landowners warned the oil companies about flooding, she said.\n\nRiebschlager related the story of one rancher: \"When they were getting ready to drill there, he said, ‘Please don't drill them here, it's a floodplain. They will flood.' The oil man says, ‘Don't worry, we'll have all the oil and gas out of this ground before the next flood.' ‘\n\nDubose, who missed out on the riches of the oil boom because her mother sold her family's mineral rights, got a similar answer when she mentioned the 1998 floods to the company drilling on her land. She recalls a man telling her: ‘That was a 100-year flood so it won't happen for another 100 years.'\n\nThat's a common misconception surrounding terms like a 100-year and the 500-year flood, said Matthew Berg, CEO of Houston-based water risk management firm Simfero. A former water specialist with Texas A&M AgriLife, he understands why the general public is misled.\n\n\"They would understand a 100-year flood only happens once every 100 years,\" he said. \"That's a problem because statistics don't work that way.\"\n\nSuch flood events don't literally return only once every century. Rather, computer models estimate that such an event has a 1% chance of occurring at any given spot in a year. What happened in previous years doesn't change those odds.\n\nFurthermore, Berg said, these estimated probabilities are \"to some extent meaningless\" where records go back barely 100 years. They are meant for purposes of development planning, not weather forecasting. The likelihood of storms across centuries isn't known. Neither is when the 500-year floodplain of the Guadalupe River may fill up again. Two things are certain, though: It will fill again and the chances are increasing.\n\nThe warming climate is making precipitation more intense in Texas and beyond. A similar amount of rain falls in fewer, more concentrated storms than it used to, according to a 2024 report from the Office of the Texas State Climatologist at Texas A&M University.\n\n\"Many studies have documented an increase in extreme rainfall in Texas and surrounding areas,\" the report said. \"Extreme rainfall is strongly affected by increased temperatures.\"\n\nIn Texas, as elsewhere on the planet, all 10 of the warmest years on record have occurred since 2011. Warming is a result of the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, released in large part by burning fossil fuels like the oil in the tanks sitting in the floodplains across the Eagle Ford Shale. And warmer air can hold more water vapor, leading to heavier downpours.\n\nIf global fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions continue to climb, so will extreme rainfall.\n\n\"Extreme precipitation is expected to increase in intensity on average statewide,\" the state climatologist's report said. \"We anticipate an additional increase of about 10% in expected extreme rainfall intensity in 2036 compared to 2001-2020 and an overall increase of over 20% compared to 1950-1999.\"\n\nThose changes in rainfall intensity correspond to a 50% increase in the likelihood of extreme precipitation compared to 2001-2020, the report said, and a 100% increase compared to 1950-1999.\n\nHowever, heavy rains alone don't always make a mega-flood. They have to fall on just the right areas, across multiple tributaries of a single river so that their waters all converge at once downstream.\n\nIf a 500-year flood returns to the Eagle Ford Shale, it's hard to tell how much oil, wastewater and other petroleum fluids could spill. Conventional oil field tanks range from 210 to 750 barrels in size, or from 13,000 to 32,000 gallons. Typical tank batteries in the Eagle Ford often include five 500-barrel oil tanks and one 500-barrel wastewater tank, according to an investor presentation by Baytex Energy. Some are out of use or empty, some are full, most are in between.\n\nWhatever fluids wash down the river would flow into San Antonio Bay, part of the winter grounds for the world's last flock of wild, endangered whooping cranes, then into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\"With a flood, it causes a lot more dispersion. It breaks it up then you've got oil mixed with sediment and debris. It can stink and it's much, much harder to clean up,\" said Diane Wilson, founder of San Antonio Bay Estuarine Waterkeeper and a 77-year-old former shrimper who lives near the mouth of the Guadalupe River. \"It would be unbelievable, the damage it could do.\"\n\nLast summer, Dubose said, she thought it was about to happen. As soon as she saw the news late at night on the Fourth of July, she rushed out and sped her white Hummer down ranch roads to the river.\n\nIncredible rainfall was hitting the Guadalupe about 150 miles upstream in the Hill Country. Online posts said the water had washed away a summer camp for girls.\n\nDubose had flashbacks to 1998, when there were also overnight rainstorms far upriver that put this region underwater for a week. So she hurried to save a mobile home parked at her fishing camp by the river, the same spot where she'd lost a mobile home in 1998.\n\nAlmost there, she passed nervously between the towering, three-story tank batteries in the floodplain on her land, then past the site of the buried waste where, she said, the grass dies each time heavy rains bring the water table to the surface.\n\nLuckily for Dubose, no torrent came downriver. For Kerrville, in the Hill Country, it was the worst flood since 1987. But all the heavy rain fell upstream of a major dam and reservoir, where water levels were low enough to absorb it. So the Eagle Ford Shale was spared, for now.\n\n\"What happened in Kerrville, if that happens here, that's a really bad situation,\" Dubose said. \"We've told the oil field, this is going to flood someday.\"\n\nThis report is published in partnership with Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, independent news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment.\n\nThis article originally published at ‘Disaster waiting to happen': Fracking boom put hundreds of tanks in Guadalupe River floodplain.",

    "description": "Christina Mann is hauling five-gallon jugs of water from a friend's house because her monthly utility bill has spiked like crazy. And she's not the only American being squeezed.",
    "fullText": "Christina Mann moved from Cleveland, Texas, to the small community of Point Blank four years ago when she retired. She wanted to retire close to the water, a dream of hers. Now, water is the nightmare that's keeping her from making ends meet.\n\nEvery other day, Mann drives several miles to a friend's house to fill five-gallon jugs from a garden hose. That water is what she uses to wash dishes, wash her hands and flush her toilets — her only supply after she decided last November to disconnect her water service entirely.\n\n\"I choose to eat, and I told them that every time you go up, that takes out of my money a month for my food,\" Mann told ABC13's 13 Investigates (1).\n\nMann lives alone on a monthly Social Security check she budgeted carefully around when she retired. There was enough to cover her bills, but barely. When the base fees charged by her provider — a for-profit company called Texas Water Utilities — kept climbing, she felt cornered. A termination notice arrived, and she didn't fight it. \"You don't need to send me one. Just come cut my water off. I can't afford it,\" she said.\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nI’m approaching retirement with no savings. Should I panic? Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nAccording to a copy of Mann's bill reviewed by 13 Investigates, she was charged $169 for a month in which she used just 2,000 gallons. In July, the fees alone — base charges for water and sewage, pass-through fees and a state fee — totaled $150.18. Her actual water and sewage usage that billing cycle came to $9.34.\n\nThat means roughly 94% of her bill had nothing to do with how much water came out of her faucet.\n\nMann said she could manage if her bill were closer to the roughly $60 a month she paid back in Cleveland.\n\nMann's provider, Texas Water Utilities, is an investor-owned utility — a for-profit company, not a city-run system. Texas Water Utilities serves about 60,000 customers in 32 counties, is acquiring at least four other companies, and has filed to tack on a $34-per-month \"system improvement charge\" to recoup more than $80 million in infrastructure spending.",

    "title": "I toured a Texas tiny-home village for retirees. The real sell wasn't the houses.",
    "description": "Touring Liberty Tiny Village, a tiny home village for older people, left me wondering what matters more in old age: extra space or a built-in community.",
    "fullText": "When I arrived at Liberty Tiny Village on a warmer than usual day in November, I thought I knew exactly what to expect.\n\nThe resort-style, 55-and-older tiny home community in Aubrey, Texas, markets itself as an upscale community for retirees or soon-to-be retirees ready to shed decades of belongings in exchange for a smaller, freer way of living.\n\nBut that's only part of the story.\n\nThat afternoon, I sat with two neighbors, widows Debbie Giamalva a retired intensive care nurse, and Sherry Miller, a retired English teacher. They told me that what they'd really found at Liberty wasn't just a smaller and more manageable home, but a caring group of friends who look out for one another.\n\nIt left me thinking about how much community matters as you age, especially when the house is quieter — when your partner is gone, and your children have lives of their own. In the moments that count, who do you turn to?\n\nLike many Texas cities and suburbs, Aubrey has been growing as people from nearby areas and high-cost states like California and New York move there seeking more affordable homes, lower taxes, and a lower overall cost of living.\n\nThose newcomers have fueled demand for every kind of housing, from apartment complexes and single-family homes to smaller, more affordable options like Liberty's tiny homes.\n\nLiberty Tiny Village was founded in 2022 and is owned by Melissa Hayes and her husband, Phillip. So far, it has 11 occupied lots.\n\nLiberty is one of several tiny-home communities that have sprung up across North Texas over the past decade, but it comes with a major perk: Because the homes are classified as recreational and can be moved, residents don't pay property taxes on them.\n\nThe village's homes are small — under 400 square feet — but not cheap; each costs between $75,000 and $160,000. Still, that's far less than the going rate in Aubrey, where Zillow put the median home-sale price at $303,550 and typical rent at $2,267 in December.\n\nKristene Newton, the village's tiny home designer, told me that most residents buy their homes outright. After that, their main monthly expense is $950 in lot rent, which covers water, sewer, trash, landscaping, and WiFi. For residents living on a mix of savings, investments, and Social Security, that kind of low and predictable bill can feel like a game changer.\n\n\"The senior community can get into one of these homes, pay for the home, and the lot rent is going to be cheaper than moving into an apartment—or sometimes even assisted living,\" Newton said.\n\nShe added that she's been shocked to see people sell million-dollar houses to get into the village's tiny homes.\n\nHayes and Newton pitch Liberty as a luxury tiny-home village. And unlike many communities I've visited around DFW, I have to agree — Liberty's homes look and feel deliberately upscale.\n\nEach of the village's homes has one to two bedrooms and one to one-and-a-half bathrooms. The primary bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, and living area are always on the first floor — a design choice that makes sense for a 55+ community.\n\nHayes told me the homes typically have stairs up to the elevated entry, but owners can add a ramp.\n\n\"Even if they want to add it at the very beginning, or decide later as they get older, they can add it,\" she said.\n\nI wanted to get inside the tiny homes to see how they actually feel — and, honestly, to see whether I could picture myself living in one.\n\nWhat surprised me most was how upscale Liberty's tiny homes looked: high ceilings, granite countertops, gleaming gold or silver faucets, chandeliers, hardwood floors, and even electric fireplaces.\n\nThe living rooms and bedrooms felt about as big as some of my first apartments right out of college — just not nearly as well decorated.\n\nThis closet is definitely bigger than the one I had in college, but I still don't think all the things I've collected since then would fit in here.\n\nI toured about five different model homes. Two of the kitchens stood out, but my favorite was the one on the right, with darker cabinetry and appliances.\n\nI've been in hotel rooms with smaller bathrooms. I think this is a pretty decent size for a tiny home.\n\nI'm 5'10\", so tall ceilings are a must. I was shocked by how spacious the two-story models felt — I couldn't believe the entire tiny home fit into just 399 square feet.\n\nIf you're willing to pay extra, many floor plans also include a loft for storage or an extra sleeping spot.\n\nI have a bunch of younger cousins. I can totally picture one of them turning this loft space into a fort.\n\nBoth women came to Liberty for a similar reason — living alone in large homes had started to feel less like freedom and more like a liability.\n\n\"My husband passed away in 2021,\" Giamalva, 70, told me. \"What did I need with a second bedroom? I also didn't need a 900-square-foot apartment.\"\n\nGiamalva paid for her tiny home in full using the money she made from selling her previous house. With her highest fixed cost now the $950 monthly lot rent, she said moving to the village was a \"no-brainer.\"\n\nMiller arrived at a similar conclusion. She'd been living in a 2,200-square-foot house with a pool, but with her son miles away at Texas A&M, she said it no longer made sense to stay there.\n\nMiller told me that moving into a tiny home solved her problems. \"I sold my house, and I didn't owe anything; I didn't have a mortgage, so I was able to take that money, buy this, and have enough left to hopefully last me the rest of my life,\" she said.\n\n\"If something happened to you in your place, everybody would know if they didn't see you,\" Giamalva said.\n\nMiller, who told me she has health issues, echoed that sentiment.\n\n\"Not to be morbid, but when you get to be a certain age, and you're living alone, you think, 'If I fell — if, God forbid, something happened to me—nobody would know. Here, we just watch out for each other.\"\n\nAt Liberty, management plans monthly events — Thanksgiving dinners, for example, and most recently a chili cook-off. Residents also meet for Bible study and, when they can, walk their dogs together.\n\nThey even have a community group chat. \"We have a good chat going,\" Miller said. \"If you needed something, all you would need to do is put it on there — and I know somebody would help.\"\n\nFor me, that sounds like the main draw: the independence of having your own place, with the comfort of knowing you're not entirely on your own.\n\nGiamalva and Miller said they wouldn't get that same mix in an assisted-living facility or retirement home, where costs are higher, and it can be harder to build relationships — or even just get around.\n\n\"As you get older and retire, your body ages, but inside, we still feel young,\" Miller said. \"So I don't want to go to some home or an apartment for old people.\"\n\nFor many of Liberty's residents, living alone must feel liberating, especially in old age, when doing so is often treated as risky or even discouraged.\n\nIt must also feel empowering. Giamalva and Miller chose to give up their bigger lives for something smaller, a move that's both brave and practical.\n\nI'm still young and newly married, so I haven't spent much time thinking about what I'd do in their position — until now.\n\nLeaving the village, I kept turning these questions over: If I ever found myself in a similar chapter, would I make the same choice? And would the promise of community make it easier to give up extra space and the things I'd accumulated over a lifetime?",

    "fullText": "Jasmine Crockett's most-watched TikTok clip is a five-second interview outside the U.S. Capitol. Someone asks the Democratic congresswoman from Texas what she would tell billionaire Elon Musk, and Crockett replies with a vulgar, two-word phrase. It’s been viewed 20.7 million times.\n\nJames Talarico’s top TikTok video is 88 seconds from a speech in which the Texas state representative says billionaires, not minorities, are destroying America, adding that “the biggest division in our politics is not left versus right, it's top versus bottom.” It’s been watched 15.5 million times.\n\nThe two are facing off in the party's U.S. Senate primary March 3, showcasing divergent approaches to harvesting a modern politician's most precious resource — attention.\n\nCrockett feuds with President Donald Trump and other Republicans. Talarico calls himself a policy wonk and quotes the Bible.\n\nWhomever Democrats nominate will say a lot about what they see as their best strategy for breaking the Republican hold on the state and helping their long-shot effort to recapture the Senate majority.\n\n“I think their voting records would be identical, but their style of politics is very different, which is fascinating to watch,” said Allison Campolo, Democratic Party chair for Fort Worth's home county.\n\nSocial media has pitfalls, though. A TikTok influencer posted this week that Talarico referred to former U.S. Rep. Colin Allred of Texas, the Democrats' unsuccessful 2024 Senate nominee, as “mediocre,” creating a tempest. Talarico is white; the influencer, Allred and Crockett are Black.\n\nTalarico put out a statement calling it a “mischaracterization” of a private conversation.\n\nDemocrats are bullish again about their chances\n\nDemocrats haven't won a Senate race in Texas since 1988, but they see an opening this year. Republicans might not renominate four-term Sen. John Cornyn and might opt for state Attorney General Ken Paxton, who's popular with Trump's base but has also spent most of his career under legal troubles. Rep. Wesley Hunt also is seeking the GOP nomination.\n\nDemocrats' success in elections since Trump began his second term — including a special election for the Texas state Senate last month — has buoyed the party’s hopes that, after decades of losses in statewide races, this may be their year.\n\nCrockett, 44, a former public defender and civil-rights attorney, served two years in the Texas House before winning her congressional seat in the Dallas area in 2022. Her supporters see her as the candidate better able to excite voters of color, who've been a key part of the Democratic base.\n\nTalarico, 36, is training to be a Presbyterian minister. A former middle school teacher, he first won his Austin-area legislative seat in 2018. His backers believe the discussion of his Christian faith could win over a wider swath of voters this fall.\n\nBoth are adept at creating digital moments — and followings.\n\nCrockett has 2.2 million TikTok followers, giving her one of the largest reaches on the platform among members of Congress. By comparison, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York has 4.1 million followers.\n\nCrockett's most popular posts include audio of Trump insulting her as she remains expressionless until flashing a smile at the end, in a video her campaign posted with the hashtag #TexasTough. Another clip, viewed 2 million times, is her simply lip-syncing to the 1990s rock hit “What's Up?” by 4 Non Blondes along with a Democratic candidate in Michigan.\n\nBut clips from combative exchanges in Congress are what accelerated Crockett's ascent into one of the party's rising young stars. In one May 2024 clash with then-Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican suggested during a hearing that Crockett’s “fake eyelashes” got in the way of reading legislation. Crockett snaps back with her own put-down, suggesting that Greene had a “bleach-blonde, bad-built butch body.”\n\nCrockett has said her training as a trial lawyer allows her to answer Republicans in the moment, but her remarks that take off on social media have also brought blowback. After a video of her calling Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who uses a wheelchair, “Governor Hot Wheels” went viral, Crockett responded by saying she was referring to Abbott using transportation to send migrants from Texas to U.S. cities.\n\nCrockett acknowledged during her only debate so far with Talarico that she is “not about politics as usual.”\n\n“I think that I will do the edgy things, the things that the political consultants will never tell you to do,” Crockett said.\n\nTalarico, who has 1.5 million TikTok followers, said Democrats cannot win the Texas seat “with the same old politics of division.”\n\nOn social media, Talarico leans into his background as a seminarian. Clips show him asking pointed questions in legislative debates, opposing school vouchers or a requirement that teachers post the Ten Commandments in their classrooms. In one video, Talarico notes lawmakers are working on the Sabbath to pass the Ten Commandments bill, a violation of one of those commandments.\n\n“Maybe they should try following the Ten Commandments before mandating them,” he wrote alongside the post.\n\nTalarico regularly talks about Jesus’ command for people to love others as they love themselves. He's done long podcast interviews, including with Joe Rogan, the popular podcaster who endorsed Trump in 2024 after the Republican sat down for an interview. Rogan told Talarico near the end of their 2 1/2-hour podcast last summer that he should run for president.\n\nDigital strategies get attention — and help fundraise\n\nPlatforms like X, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok also help candidates raise money and test messaging.\n\n“You can communicate as often as you want at the times that you prefer and you can vary the format,” said Pinar Yildirim, an associate professor of marketing and economics at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business.\n\nCandidates tie social media content to online ads to test which messages most effectively bring potential supporters to their websites, said Jennifer Stromer-Galley, a professor of information studies at Syracuse University.\n\n“Now they can do it in much more fine-grained, real-time ways,” said Stromer-Galley, who wrote a book on the history of presidential candidates’ online campaign efforts.\n\nSocial media also bridges the distance between Senate candidates and the national donor base they need to tap, said Mike Doyle, the Democratic chair for Austin’s home county.\n\nCrockett raised about $642,000 during the first week of her campaign and has collected $6.5 million so far, most of it carried over from her House account. Talarico raised more than $1.2 million in his campaign's first week, on his way to more than $13 million in contributions so far.\n\n“You don't have to be on the ground to see Jasmine or James on social media,” Doyle said.",

    "title": "Elon Musk says it's hard to convince engineers with families to move to SpaceX's 'technology monastery' in Texas",
    "description": "\"It's like a technology monastery thing,\" Musk said about SpaceX's Starbase campus. \"Remote and mostly dudes.\"",
    "fullText": "SpaceX and Tesla both began in California before relocating their headquarters to Texas — a move Elon Musk has said created a hiring challenge.\n\nMusk, the CEO of both companies, said married technicians, engineers, and scientists have struggled to bring their families to certain parts of the state. The problem is most acute at SpaceX's south Texas launch site and headquarters, known as Starbase.\n\n\"I call it the 'significant other' problem,\" Musk said during a nearly three-hour interview with tech podcaster Dwarkesh Patel and Stripe's cofounder John Collison that was posted on Thursday. \"For Starbase, that was particularly difficult, since the odds of finding a non-SpaceX job are pretty low.\"\n\nStarbase — where SpaceX has built and tested its rockets since 2019 — is situated in a sparsely populated area of Texas, close to the US‑Mexico border. It's located across from the largely undeveloped Las Palomas Wildlife Management Area.\n\nThe campus is roughly a 40‑minute drive from Brownsville, the nearest city, according to Google Maps. Brownsville has a population of around 187,000, based on the most recent US Census data.\n\nThat remoteness marks a sharp contrast with SpaceX's former headquarters in El Segundo, California, which is minutes from Los Angeles and part of one of the country's largest job markets.\n\n\"It's like a technology monastery thing,\" Musk said about Starbase. \n\"Remote and mostly dudes.\"\n\nTesla, which moved its headquarters from California to Austin in 2021, faces a similar — though less severe — challenge, Musk said.\n\nThe automaker's campus, called Giga Texas, is a roughly 30-minute drive from downtown Austin, where nearly 1 million people live. Plus, while Tesla's top executives have largely moved to Texas, the electric car company still maintains several robotics, energy, and manufacturing operations in California.\n\n\"Tesla being engineering, especially being primarily in Silicon Valley, it's easier for people to just... They don't have to change their life very much. Their commutes are going to be the same,\" he said. \"Tesla still has a majority of its engineering in California.\"\n\nMusk, who has predicted Austin will be \"the biggest boomtown that America has seen in 50 years,\" has made moves to build out his company campuses, including a company town called \"Snailbrook\" near The Boring Company and SpaceX.",

    "description": "The Texas Longhorns evened up their SEC record at 5-5 with a win over South Carolina but their slow starts are still a problem area that Sean Miller must fix.",
    "fullText": "The 2025-26 Texas men's basketball team will never make it look easy.\n\nMost every game is a scrap, opponent's record be damned.\n\nAnd so it went Tuesday against South Carolina at sleepy Moody Center.\n\nThe Longhorns are smart enough to realize they can’t look past anybody, yet they were locked in the middle of a cockfight at crunch time against a team with nothing to lose. SC, now 2-8 in SEC play, isn’t a good team but a visitor from another planet would not have been able to pick which team was favored by 13 points at certain points.\n\nMORE CED: Why Texas baseball's Schlossnagle sought roster depth in the offseason\n\nThe 84-75 win had to happen at this point in the season lest the Horns were about to start wondering if they would accept the predictable NIT invitation in a couple of months.\n\n  It's called Ced’s Corner, from the mind of the American-Statesman’s resident sports columnist, the 2025 NSMA Texas Sportswriter of the Year.\n\nAs it turns out, they shook off a comatose start in front of a late-arriving crowd for the early tipoff — the student section at Moody was noticeably thin — survived 35 points from South Carolina guard Meechie Johnson and blistered the Gamecocks with 49 second-half points to win a game much closer than the final score indicated.\n\nAnd all of a sudden, the Horns, after an 0-2 start in conference play, are firmly in the NCAA Tournament mix. They’re 13-9 overall and 5-5 in the league which puts them only one win from matching last season’s conference total, though it’s obvious the SEC isn’t as strong as the 2025 group that sent 14 teams to the NCAAs.\n\nWith beatable Ole Miss coming to town Saturday and Chris Beard coming off an 84-66 beatdown courtesy of fellow former Longhorn coach Rick Barnes’ Tennessee team, there is a chance to stack a third straight win.\n\nThe Horns avoided a fate similar to what happened to the football team after it lost to a bad Florida team, effectively crippling its chances to make the College Football Playoff. In basketball’s case, they figured it out thanks to a couple of second-half 3-pointers from Cam Heide, who has emerged as a needed source of offense of late; 15 second-half points from veteran guard Tramon Mark and another 20 from All-SEC candidate Dailyn Swain.\n\nWith football coach Steve Sarkisian and baseball coach Jim Schlossnagle seated together courtside, the Horns pulled it together in front of 10,286 who rose to their feet, some of them for the first time all evening.\n\nMORE HORNS: Texas athletics lost money in 2025\n\nOne question can apply to both the fans and the team they were watching. Where was the energy?\n\nWe understand that a 6 p.m. start and Austin traffic aren’t made for one another but the fans who were there for the tip didn’t bring a whole lot of energy to a team that has a recent history of slow starts. The Horns missed seven of their first eight shots and didn’t reach double digits until the 11-minute, 14-second mark of the first half.\n\n“The message is to keep being aggressive,” Heide said. “You’ve got to go in there and set the tone. If we do that, it’s really going to help.”\n\nMORE CED: Where Texas football landed on the Ceddy Awards\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, the crowd will help too.\n\nAt one point of the second half with the game still in the balance, coach Sean Miller raised his arms to the fans, asking them to give his team some energy. If we’re being honest, the crowd was as lethargic as the guys playing even if the result turned out in Texas’ favor.\n\n“The one thing about the crowd is you have to give them something to cheer about,” Miller said. “It’s not one-sided. They're coming here. They're sacrificing. They're coming to watch Texas. They want us to win. They want to see a great game. And you’ve got to be locked in.”\n\nTexas players, coming off a big win at Oklahoma, weren't locked in for large parts of the game, particularly point guard Jordan Pope who suffered through a 26-minute nightmare.\n\nOne of the most experienced guards in the college game missed five of his six field goal attempts and finished with no assists. He went without a field goal for the first 34-plus minutes. When asked if he would consider moving Pope to the wing, Miller said “I think we’ve got him at the right spot. He told me he was a point guard.”\n\nIt’s an understatement to say Texas plays to the competition because the Horns are good enough to give a good team like Auburn a tussle and shaky enough to be locked in a 50-50 wrestling match with the No. 15 team in the 16-team SEC.\n\nThey’re never going to be a shutdown defense as evidenced by the No. 96 defensive ranking per kenpom.com will attest. More important was a move up to No. 33 in Ken's NCAA NET ratings, seventh among SEC teams.\n\nSeven-foot sophomore post Matas Vokietaitis is going through some growing pains on both ends. He continues to commit careless fouls on defense and continues to get stripped by smaller players because he brings the ball down in traffic despite being only three feet from the bucket. He is second on the team with 53 turnovers, a huge number for the position. Worse yet, he missed more point-blank looks than his coaches care to count.\n\nLooking ahead, the Horns are in play to make a realistic run at the Big Dance but they can’t afford to give away winnable games. Ole Miss, at 11-11 overall and 3-6 in the SEC, represents a nice chance to move over .500 after 11 games for the first time since Rodney Terry took over the 2023 team after Beard’s firing. Texas started 8-3 and advanced to the Elite Eight with a win over Miller’s Xavier team that season.\n\nLots has changed since then and if you ask Miller, more change is needed — particularly on defense.\n\nIf anything, they’re in a good place considering where they started.",

    "fullText": "SAN ANGELO, Texas (Concho Valley Homepage) — The Angelo State Rams welcomed their newest members of the 2026 roster on Wednesday, Feb 4.\n\nIt may only be February, but it’s never too early to look ahead to fall and the 2026 football season. The Angelo State Rams introduced their latest offseason acquisitions Wednesday night in front of an audience of coaches, families and friends at Shenanigan’s Sports Bar in San Angelo. Rams head football coach Jeff Girsch spoke at the gathering, introducing each incoming high school signee by projecting their highlights via Hudl.\n\nThe Rams added 22 high school signees as well as five college transfers. Girsch couldn’t be more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.\n\n“We know they’re going to be good football players [just by] watching their film and seeing that, so that evaluation is pretty easy,” Girsch said. “But getting to know these guys over time and recruiting them [excites us]. We started recruiting some of them back in the summer, and all the way getting through the season and the visit season.”\n\nGirsch isn’t the only coach excited about this incoming class. The Rams’ new offensive coordinator, Jason Johnson, is ready to embrace his new opportunity and is thrilled to work with athletes showing vast versatility.\n\n“I’m really excited about the athleticism because they bring so much versatility to what we do from that standpoint,” Johnson said. “We can use [the players] in different places, not just on offense and defense, but also in our special teams units.”",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M (17-4, 7-1 SEC) is currently taking on Alabama for a midweek road trip, looking to reach 8-1 in conference play, and stay atop the conference standings before hosting Florida on Saturday afternoon.\n\nFirst-year head coach Bucky McMillan has led the Aggies to their second-best start in SEC play since joining the conference before the 2012 season, and wouldn't be anywhere this season without Spanish sharpshooter Rubén Dominguez, who is averaging 12.9 points per game, 2.4 rebounds, 1.5 assist, and averaging 44.9% from the field, 43.4% frome three-point, and 89.6% from the free throw line.\n\nOne of the best three-point shooters in the country, Dominguez is expected to remain a key part of McMillan's future rosters with two years of eligibility, and in the new age of college basketball, landing international players during the transfer portal period has become a popular trend, and will continue, especially in the SEC.\n\nDuring Dominguez's transition to Texas A&M, McMillan and his staff encountered no issues beyond travel, which took longer than for the other 14 new additions to the roster.\n\nHowever, the drama surrounding former NBA G-League center Charles Bediako, who returned to Alabama late last month, is currently playing vs. Texas A&M, but will be back in court after receiving a temporary restraining order by Judge James Roberts, who has since recused himself from the case.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bediako’s attorneys reportedly sent the NCAA a list of admissions regarding the eligibility of international professional basketball players, including Texas A&M star Rubén Dominguez. Within the document provided by Bama247 writer Mike Rodak, Bediako's legal team listed the Texas A&M sophomore as the 38th example of an international player who was granted eligibility.\n\n\"Admit that you have granted eligibility to Ruben Dominguez, a current student-athlete at Texas A&M University and former member of Movistar Estudiantes from Spain.\"\n\nAlabama is currently 14-7 and 4-4 in SEC play before the conclusion of Wednesday's, and if Bediako isn't granted an eligibility extension, the Crimson Tide will be lacking size in the front court.\n\nBediako’s attorneys sent the NCAA a list of admissions regarding the eligibility of international professional basketball players. pic.twitter.com/Uheimc2BXq\n\n— Mike Rodak (@mikerodak) February 4, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Rubén Dominguez is named in Charles Bediako's eligibility dispute",

And we've never even done a deposition,\"  Johnson said in the video. \"Our insurance company just settles. John Witherspoon says we can kill two people a year and ‘we are fine.’\"\n\nScubatoys, NAUI, PADI, the Scuba Ranch and the Harrison family’s attorney did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.

He reached the CFP two of the previous three seasons and barely missed this past season. But he’s on the warming seat. And he’s got company. Sarkisian is preparing for his sixth season at Texas after seeing 26 of his players transfer out and 19 transfer in, including the portal’s top-ranked wide receiver, two outstanding running backs and two elite linebackers. The big number of those leaving suggest Texas badly missed its evaluations on more than two dozen players or drastically upgraded all of those positions. Actually, both of those premises could be true. Sarkisian at least grasps the sense of urgency among Longhorn Nation because this isn’t a place where you want to miss the playoff two years in a row. But he’s not alone. I’d say the top five coaches with the most heat on them, in order, are Alabama’s Kalen DeBoer, Oregon’s Dan Lanning, Sarkisian, LSU’s Lane Kiffin and USC’s Lincoln Riley. None of these obviously are in a must-win situation like some others. … Those on the hottest of hot seats are Baylor’s Dave Aranda (three losing seasons in the past four years), Florida State’s Mike Norvell (coming off 2-10 and 5-7 seasons), Wisconsin’s Luke Fickell (16-21 over three years), Maryland’s Mike Locksley (1-8 in Big Ten two straight years) and South Carolina’s Shane “Did you see our first half against the Aggies?” Beamer. … Of the group needing to break through and avoid slipping backward, they just need to win big and dispel the notion that they have hit a wall and have to get past it. DeBoer, it says here, is the best coach in the nation not named Kirby Smart, Curt Cignetti or Ryan Day, yet a large percentage of Crimson Tide fans think his days might be numbered if a third year isn’t more successful after missing the CFP in Year 1 and winning one CFP game over an average Oklahoma team in Year 2. Lanning has been a borderline disaster in the CFP, getting squashed by Ohio State in 2024 and mauled by Indiana in 2025 (after dominating Texas Tech). Kiffin may or may not have a honeymoon in his first season at Baton Rouge, but he’s still not been on the sidelines for a CFP game yet in his career. Riley can sure develop a quarterback or two with Caleb Williams and Jayden Maiava, but when is the breakthrough season coming? Lots of urgency in 2026.“\n\nWHAT THEY’RE SAYING ABOUT THE LONGHORNS\n\nAustin American-Statesman: Golden: Why depth is key for Jim Schlossnagle, 2026 Texas baseball\n\nAustin American-Statesman: Texas Longhorns: 5 stats UT must improve to win championship\n\nAustin American-Statesman: Sean Miller, Longhorns earn average marks with midseason grades\n\nAustin American-Statesman: Why Texas basketball coach Sean Miller has kept the faith in his bench\n\nInside Texas: Texas’ likely preference for outside zone is perfect for Hollywood Smothers and Raleek Brown\n\nInside Texas: Bijan Robinson: Three years into the NFL\n\nTexas holds off South Carolina in 84-75 win\n\nNo 4.

    "fullText": "Texas A&M (17-4, 7-1 SEC) still sits atop the SEC standings after defeating Georgia on the road 92-77, and with seven wins in conference play, the Aggies likely need at least three more victories to solidify their NCAA Tournament chances as an at-large bid. Set to face Alabama on the road, the Crimson Tide is desperate to protect home court after falling to Florida on the road 100-77.\n\nEntering Wednesday's road test, first-year head coach Bucky McMillan spent Monday praising his team rather than spending both the pregame press conference and Aggie basketball hour discussing Alabama's roster, especially center Charles Bediako, who will be available on Wednesday amid his ongoing eligibility battle. After shooting 45% from the field and 38% from beyond the arc, the Aggies will need to continue outshooting opponents to keep the win streak alive.\n\nHowever, Alabama has nearly matched Texas A&M from three-point range over the past two games, making an average of 14 threes per game compared to the Aggies' 15.\n\nHealth-wise, outside of Indiana transfer forward Mackenzie Mgbako, McMillan's roster is entirely healthy heading into Wednesday night, and according to the initial injury report, Alabama will be without three players, while forward Taylor Bol Bowen (7.7 PPG, 5.4 RPG), who was injured against Florida, is listed as \"questionable\" with a 50% chance to play.\n\nEven if Bol Bowen doesn't play, Texas A&M will face a healthy Alabama squad led by star guard Labaron Philon Jr., who is averaging 21.6 points per game, shooting 51% from the field, and 38% from beyond the arc.\n\nThe SEC Student-Athlete Availability Report ahead of Texas A&M at Alabama tomorrow night: pic.twitter.com/M8t9COrbYQ\n\n— TexAgs (@TexAgs) February 4, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M is 100% healthy before facing Alabama on Wednesday",

    "fullText": "Arlington (Texas) Mansfield Timberview three-star wide receiver Trysten Shaw announced on Tuesday evening that he has decommitted from UCLA.\n\nShaw was pledged to the Bruins since Aug. 20 and originally stayed locked in despite the departure of head coach DeShaun Foster. He even returned to Westwood over the weekend for a junior day visit and reaffirmed his pledge. He’s now opted to re-open his process between his junior and senior seasons.\n\n“After a long thought and prayer with my family, I have decided to decommit and reopen my recruitment. Thank you UCLA for the opportunity,” Shaw wrote announcing his decision on X.\n\nShaw is the No. 678 overall prospect and No. 94 WR in the 2027 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all major recruiting media companies. He’s also the No. 86 player in Texas.\n\nThe 5-foot-10, 165-pounder currently holds offers from the likes of Ole Miss, Arkansas, Kansas State, Syracuse, Pitt, Kentucky and a slew of others.\n\nShaw leaves new head coach Bob Chesney and the Bruins with just one commit in the 2027 class. On Monday, UCLA landed a commitment from Temecula (Calif.) Chaparral three-star WR Michael Farinas.\n\n“Honestly I love the culture that coach Chesney is bringing to the program,” Farinas told Rivals’ Greg Biggins. “Coach Chesney is a proven winner and I know he’s going to bring that to UCLA.\n\n“Everyone in the program wants to win and that’s something I want to be a part of. They’re building something special so I’m very excited to be a Bruin.”\n\nFarinas may now be the lone pledge in the UCLA class, but the Bruins’ big junior day weekend has them soaring with top recruits that were in attendance. Biggins has all the latest intel coming out of the weekend as Chesney and Co. look to usher in a new era of football in Los Angeles.",

    "description": "The Longhorns hope to take advantage of three of the next four games at home against weaker conference opponents.",
    "fullText": "The Longhorns hope to take advantage of three of the next four games at home against weaker conference opponents.\n\nAt the midway point of SEC play, the Texas Longhorns are firmly on the NCAA Tournament bubble as the last team in the field of Joe Lunardi’s Bracketology after opening a winnable stretch of games with Saturday’s 10-point victory over the Oklahoma Sooners in Norman prior to hosting the South Carolina Gamecocks at the Moody Center on Tuesday.\n\nNext Saturday, disgraced former head coach Chris Beard brings his scuffling Ole Miss team to the Forty Acres, followed by a road game against Missouri and a home matchup against LSU. A win probability of 50 percent for the game in Columbia the lowest of that stretch for the Longhorns, creating an imperative for first-year head coach Sean Miller’s team to at least protect home court at the Moody Center.\n\nEven a win on Tuesday would represent just the second time in conference play that Texas has won back-to-back games and the only winning streak longer than that came early in the season when the Longhorns notched four straight games against some of the worst teams in the country.\n\nBut since the 14-point loss to Tennessee in Knoxville in which Texas struggled to compete, Miller’s team has had chances to win every other game, including in hostile environments like Rupp Arena in Lexington and Neville Arena in Auburn.\n\nAfter taking an eight-point lead into halftime against the Tigers, however, the game got away from the Longhorns in the second half because Texas committed 18 fouls that led to 28 free-throw attempts for Auburn.\n\n“Not a lot else changed, but what really changed is their free-throw attempts,” Miller said in an appearance on On Texas Football. “It’s not eight fouls that we’re trying to get rid of, it’s the two, three, or four undisciplined fouls that we can correct, that we are working hard to correct.”\n\nThose several undisciplined fouls add up quickly in close games — in the four SEC loses outside of the poor effort against the Volunteers, the Longhorns have lost by an average of 4.5 points.\n\n“That’s four free-throw attempts. They didn’t get into bonus as early. There’s a huge swing when you can foul less in college basketball, and I think that’s plagued our defense, and we could be a better overall defensive team. I’ve told our guys on a daily basis, if the number goes in the right direction defensively for us, a lot of the things that we’re hunting and going after will come true, but we’re only going to go as far on this path as our defensive improvement allows us,” Miller said.\n\nTexas currently ranks 297th in opposing free-throw rate.\n\nThe single player Miller needs to make strides in fouling less over the final nine SEC games is sophomore center Matas Vokietaitis, who is averaging 5.2 fouls per 40 minutes.\n\n“He gets fouled as much as any player that plays college basketball, so the spotlight is always on him — that means you have to be even more disciplined and smarter when it’s your turn to defend. There are times to be physical and there’s times to let it go, and there’s times that you have to show your hands and go vertical, and there’s times when you have to do a lot of work with your legs and your chest, your torso, and not your hands. We’ve had a hard time, truth be told, with Matas in that area, but he’s better than he was, for example, when we played in the Maui Invitational,” Miller said.\n\nVokietaitis is also better than he was last year as a freshman at Florida Atlantic in his first season playing basketball in the United States, cutting his fouling by almost a full foul per 40 minutes.\n\nFor the Texas team, however, a worse forced turnover rate than opposing free-throw rate is a bad duo.\n\n“We don’t force turnovers and we foul — that’s a wicked combination. Teams that don’t force turnovers can win big, but you cannot foul,” Miller said on Monday.\n\nThe other area defensively that the Longhorns need to improve in is three-point defense. Texas is limiting opponents to a three-point rate of 35.6 percent, 60th nationally, but allowing opponents to make 35.4 percent of those attempts 258th nationally.\n\nBecause the Horns have a low three-point rate and an even lower assist rate, the degree of difficulty for those three-point attempts is heightened because they often come off the dribble, and the combination of allowing that level of efficiency from opponents and not making up for it in volume can create large margins like the Hoos notching a 24-point edge in points off threes in their 19-point win in December.\n\nBut despite those weaknesses offensively, Miller and his staff have managed to create the most efficient offense at Texas since DJ Augustin and Damion James led the Longhorns to the Elite Eight in 2007-08, an attack built primarily on getting to the free-throw line and scoring in the paint.\n\nAnd it’s not just Vokietaitis buoying those areas of success — junior wing Dailyn Swain has also attempted more than 100 free throws so far this season and taken even more shots around the rim than the big Lithuanian.\n\nOver the last four games, Swain has been sensational, averaging 25.8 points, 7.3 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 2.5 steals while shooting 64.9 percent from the floor, 44.4 percent from three, and 87.5 percent from the free-throw line.\n\nAlready one of the most dangerous players in the country off the bounce, Swain’s ability to shoot threes effectively is a force multiplier for his game, especially in bailing Texas out of poor possessions in late-clock situations.\n\nThe shooting improvement has taken a lot of hard work behind the scenes from Swain, whose high-major interest out of high school in Columbus was limited by his lack of shooting range.\n\n“It wasn’t that he couldn’t shoot or you didn’t like the way his shot looked like, he basically ignored that part of the game. He did it really almost through his entire time in high school,” Miller said.\n\nAfter signing with Xavier, Swain was 4-of-26 shooting from three as a freshman (15.4 percent) before showing some signs of improvement in making seven of his 28 attempts last season (25 percent). In practice, Miller and his staff spent a year and a half forcing the talented wing to shoot open threes, leading to enough improvement that he gained the confidence to take and make them in games — he’s now a 31.7-percent shooter this season and at 35.5 percent in SEC play.\n\nAs an almost 80 percent career shooter from the free-throw line, Swain’s ability to convert those opportunities gave Miller hope that he could eventually add a three-point shot to his game. Now he has, and it’s made him one of the most efficient scorers in the nation’s best basketball conference.\n\nSouth Carolina arrives in Austin with just two SEC wins, coming against LSU on the road and Oklahoma at home, leaving the Gamecocks at 15th in the conference in adjusted efficiency. But as the overtime loss to Mississippi State in the conference opener revealed a month ago, Texas can play poorly enough to lose to anyone, especially if the team is giving up a lot of three-pointers to opposing guards or debilitated by its fouling virus.\n\nSo Miller is emphasizing what the Longhorns need to do to win rather than focusing on the opponent specifically.\n\n“We just have to be at our best. Period. I think it’s like a nameless, faceless league. On your end, your preparation, your readiness, how you attack the game, how you play, you’ve got to be at your best, and the more you can be at your best, the better opportunity you have for success. So the only thing that’s different about this week is we have back-to-back home games. Other than that, I think we have to look at this — this is an SEC team and we all know what that is,” Miller said.\n\nTip is at 6 p.m. Central on SEC Network with Texas boasting an 85-percent win probability, according to Bart Torvik.",

    "description": "With now just a month to go until Election Day, the Democratic primary for US Senate in Texas has become so fraught that a TikToker’s accusations have roiled the race and prompted a major endorsement in the backlash.",
    "fullText": "With now just a month to go until Election Day, the Democratic primary for US Senate in Texas has become so fraught that a TikToker’s accusations have roiled the race and prompted a major endorsement in the backlash.\n\nThe incident started Sunday night when Morgan Thompson posted a video recounting what she says was a comment Texas state Rep. James Talarico made to her in a private conversation in January: that he called his onetime opponent, former US Rep. Colin Allred, a “mediocre Black man.”\n\nTalarico’s campaign released a statement from the candidate on Monday calling Thompson’s claims “a mischaracterization of a private conversation,” going on to explain, “I described Congressman Allred’s method of campaigning as mediocre — but his life and service are not.” Thompson acknowledged that she didn’t have a recording and that they had previously agreed to treat their conversation as off the record.\n\nBut the accusation slammed Talarico’s campaign on Monday, sending aides into a flurry and prompting Allred — who dropped out of the Senate race when Rep. Jasmine Crockett decided to make a last-minute entry — to endorse her in the intense race, despite frustrations he had in December that she had chased him out of the race by getting in. It also renewed the questions about identity politics and electability that have riven the primary and the Democratic Party more broadly.\n\nThompson alleges that Talarico, who is White, said: “I signed up to run against a mediocre Black man, not a formidable, intelligent Black woman.”\n\nTalarico, in his statement denying the exact wording as Thompson relayed it, said, “I understand how my critique of the Congressman’s campaign could be interpreted given this country’s painful legacy of racism, and I care deeply about the impact my words have on others.”\n\nIn an interview on Monday evening, Allred told CNN he felt the campaign’s statement is “an admission that he said what he said,” and expressed surprise that he hadn’t heard from Talarico directly.\n\n“I responded not just on my behalf, but on behalf of Black candidates around the country that even if you run six points ahead of your presidential candidate, you’re still called ‘mediocre,’” Allred said, referring to his results in the 2024 Senate race as compared to Kamala Harris in the state. (Allred outperformed Harris by about five points.)\n\nThompson told CNN that she had been turned on to Talarico’s campaign by a friend last fall and preferred him over Allred. After attending an event of his in Dallas, she started using her social media following to boost him. Talarico’s staff reached out about her video from the rally, she said, and was soon feeding her information like fundraising numbers and clips from his “Jubilee” online debate to help.\n\n“It was like a symbiotic kind of thing. I wasn’t paid by the campaign at all,” Thompson said, though, “I was in constant communication with the campaign.”\n\nThompson said the relationship started to break down after she got a fundraising text for Talarico, signed by the Democratic strategist James Carville, who has been urging Democrats to start moving away from identity politics. Thompson said she saw that as an implicit critique of Black women, and that when she raised her frustrations with the campaign, an aide offered her to have a conversation with Talarico — either on camera for her to post, or “off the record,” as what was meant to be a private conversation.\n\nShe says she opted for the less formal conversation, without a recording. But she says she remembers the exchange, which took place backstage before a town hall in Plano on January 12, very well. Thompson said she raised concerns about the association with Carville and suggested that maybe he was chasing a big name, prompting Talarico to say, “So you’re concerned about me being a sell out?” She said she told him he was overlooking the racial dynamics he’d tipped into, prompting him to say, “I have blind spots.”\n\nCampaign spokesman JT Ennis confirmed the association with Thompson — “the Talarico campaign works with lots of creators in Texas to keep them updated on the campaign,” he said — and that they did speak before the Plano event. But Ennis told CNN Talarico does not recall making either of those statements, and that his version was backed up by an aide whom both said was in the room but was not made available for an interview.\n\nThe conversation turned, Thompson said, when she mentioned to Talarico online chatter she was seeing from people wishing he had run for governor instead — an option he had considered before launching the Senate run and was urged to reconsider when Crockett jumped into the race late.\n\n“That is when he said, ‘I signed up to run against a mediocre black man, not a formidable, intelligent Black woman,’” Thompson said, “That is a direct quote.”\n\nThompson also accused Talarico’s campaign of trying to silence her, claiming that her Instagram account had disappeared and her Threads account had been suspended within minutes of when she posted a video about her claims. Thompson does not know how this would have happened, she acknowledged, given that no one on the campaign has her password, but “It’s just too many factors in play. It’s just too many abnormalities. The timing of it was so fast.”\n\nAs for Thompson’s claims about the social media accounts being closed, Ennis said, “No. We do not have that kind of power, nor would we ever do that.”\n\nShortly after Thompson’s video went viral, Allred posted his own video ripping Talarico.\n\n“Let me just give you some free advice, James,” Allred said. “If you want to compliment Black women, just do it. Just do it. Don’t do it while also tearing down a Black man.”\n\nHe also suggested Talarico, a Presbyterian seminarian, was getting unfair attention for his discussion on the campaign trail of Christianity and how Democrats can make inroads with religious voters.\n\n“We don’t need you,” he said. “You’re not saying anything unique. You’re just saying it looking like you do.”\n\nThe Senate primary is March 3. Allred is also on the ballot that day, in a House primary against Rep. Julie Johnson that he entered after leaving the Senate race.",

The franchisee operates roughly 40 of the company's 500 gyms, according to recent press releases.\n\nIn the memo, the franchise said its policy was to \"cooperate with any law enforcement officer,\" including ICE.\n\nUnder a subsection titled \"what to expect during a raid,\" the franchise told employees that some ICE raids \"can last hours\" and could include searches of \"offices, lockers, or computers\" — all searches that would require a judicial warrant. Staff were instructed to contact management, keep members calm, and tell them \"not to interfere with the agents.\" The franchisee and its owner didn't respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThe guidance quickly sparked criticism online, with dozens of users across TikTok, Instagram, X, and Reddit saying they had canceled their Crunch memberships in protest.\n\nOn Monday, a spokesperson for Crunch told Business Insider the memo \"does not represent Crunch Fitness's corporate policy.\" The spokesperson also said the gym's lobby is the only area law enforcement can access without a warrant.\n\n\"This approach is consistent with Crunch's standards and our long-standing commitment to maintaining welcoming, safe spaces for our members and employees,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Saturday, Crunch Fitness' national social media account distanced itself from the franchise's memo, saying the internal document had been \"misinterpreted.\"\n\nA post shared by Crunch Fitness (@crunchgym)\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with front-end managers and staff at eight Crunch locations across the US. All requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nTwo managers said they had discussed potential ICE scenarios directly with their franchise owners — not with Crunch's corporate office. Front-end staff said they had not received guidance from the national brand, and three employees said they were unsure of any ICE policy as of Monday.\n\nEvery employee interviewed said they had read the leaked memo from the Texas franchise.\n\nOnline reaction has been divided. While several users said they were canceling memberships, others argued that customers were unfairly blaming Crunch's corporate brand for the actions of a single franchise operator.\n\nThe controversy comes amid heightened public scrutiny of corporate relationships with federal immigration enforcement, particularly after two fatal shootings by federal agents in Minneapolis last month.\n\nIn early January, Hilton Hotels faced backlash after one of its Minnesota franchises denied ICE agents access. Hilton removed the location from its system shortly afterward. Rental car giant Enterprise also faced protests after social media users accused the company of providing vehicles to federal agents.\n\nActivists have been calling for a national strike on billion-dollar businesses amid the rising tensions.",

    "description": "A newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch delivered a sharp warning to President Donald Trump after a high-profile Republican loss. In a new editorial, The Wall Street Journal warned Trump that a hardline immigration strategy promoted by top aide Stephen Miller is fueling voter backlash. It comes after a Trump-endorsed candidate for the Texas state senate lost to a Democrat over the weekend.",
    "fullText": "A newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch delivered a sharp warning to President Donald Trump after a high-profile Republican loss.\n\nIn a new editorial, The Wall Street Journal warned Trump that a hardline immigration strategy promoted by top aide Stephen Miller is fueling voter backlash.\n\nIt comes after a Trump-endorsed candidate for the Texas state senate lost to a Democrat over the weekend.\n\n“How does a Republican lose by 14 points in a safe conservative Texas state Senate seat that President Trump carried by 17 points in 2024? Answer: When there’s a voter backlash against the Trump Administration, notably its mass deportation debacles,” the Journal wrote, describing the special election in Tarrant County.\n\nDemocrat Taylor Rehmet, a labor union leader and veteran, easily defeated Republican Leigh Wambsganss, who had Trump’s endorsement on Truth Social and vastly outspent her opponent.\n\nRehment is the first Democrat to hold the seat in decades.\n\nThe paper noted the timing was disastrous for Republicans, coming after the high-profile Minneapolis killings by federal immigration agents. “The 31-point vote swing in a little more than 14 months can only be explained as part of a rising tide of opposition to Mr. Trump’s first year and a sour public mood,” the Journal observed.\n\nThe White House has faced mounting national backlash after federal immigration agents fatally shot two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis—Renee Good in early January and Alex Pretti later that month—as part of aggressive enforcement operations in the state.\n\nBoth cases sparked controversy over conflicting official narratives. In Pretti’s case, Homeland Security officials and White House aides initially claimed he approached agents with a gun and posed a threat, while bystander videos show him holding only a cellphone before being pinned down and shot.\n\nSimilarly, authorities initially suggested that Good tried to ram agents with her vehicle before she was fatally shot, a claim contradicted by eyewitness footage and reporting. Critics argue these early statements painted both victims as dangerous to justify the shootings, fueling accusations that the administration misrepresented the events.\n\nThe killings came after Trump deployed thousands of federal immigration agents to Minneapolis as part of an aggressive immigration strategy masterminded by Miller.\n\nMiller’s immigration strategy under Trump has pushed aggressive mass arrests and deportations, with ICE agents pressured to meet high daily quotas, even targeting non-criminal undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal critiqued Miller’s hardline tactics, including a daily quota of 3,000 migrant arrests that it says “was bound to result in agent intrusions into homes and businesses.”\n\nWhile immigration has historically been a winning issue for Republicans, the Journal cautioned that enforcement “that turns ugly in the streets is turning off the swing voters who will determine who wins the race for Congress this year.”\n\nPolls have recently shown Americans turning on Trump and his immigration strategy ahead of the 2026 Midterms. A YouGov poll conducted on January 25 showed that about half (48 percent) of respondents do not think the shooting of Pretti in Minneapolis was justified.\n\nAnother YouGov poll showed that 52 percent of Americans think the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict immigration to the U.S. have gone too far.\n\nAs a result, the paper concluded that even as Trump signals a desire to “dial back the confrontations on the street,” he must also reconsider Miller’s influence. “The Miller strategy isn’t likely to fare better this year,” the editorial warned.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal is not the first Murdoch-owned newspaper to publicly condemn Trump’s immigration strategy.\n\nIn an op-ed published last week, the New York Post argued that the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement in Minneapolis is backfiring politically.\n\n“These enforcement tactics won’t turn the tide, instead they are backfiring,” the Post wrote.",

    "fullText": "The father of a 5-year-old boy who was detained by immigration officers and held at an federal facility in Texas denied government accounts Monday that he abandoned his son as the pair returned to Minnesota.\n\nAdrian Conejo Arias, who is originally from Ecudador, told ABC News that he loves his son, Liam, and would never abandon him, disputing statements from the Department of Homeland Security, which alleged that Arias had left his child in a vehicle. He also said his son got sick while in federal custody but was denied medicine.\n\nAssistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that Arias fled on foot before he was arrested, “abandoning his child.” She said Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers stayed with the boy.\n\n“The facts in this case have NOT changed: The father who was illegally in the country chose to take his child with him to a detention center,\" she said.\n\nMcLaughlin did not address Arias' statement that his son was denied medication while in custody.\n\nArias also said he was arrested unjustly and contended he was in the country legally, with a pending court hearing for asylum.\n\nThe comments come after a federal judge ordered over the weekend that the pair be freed. They were released Sunday and returned to Minnesota, according to Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas.\n\nThe family's arrest and release unfolded during President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration, which has led to daily protests that included the shooting deaths of two American citizens by federal officers. The president last week ordered his top border adviser to oversee the crackdown days after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti, an intensive care nurse at a Veterans Affairs hospital.\n\nBorder czar Tom Homan suggested that mistakes have been made, but he said agents would continue to enforce federal law and called on local and state officials to cooperate with federal officers.\n\nThe boy's detention drew outrage as images of immigration officers surrounding the young boy in a blue bunny hat and Spider-Man backpack began to surface.\n\nMcLaughlin said ICE did not target or arrest the boy, and she repeated assertions that his mother refused to take him after his father’s apprehension. His father told officers he wanted Liam to be with him, she said.\n\nMcLaughlin also said last month that the child was abandoned and that officers tried to get the mother to take custody of the child. “Officers even assured her she would NOT be taken into custody.”\n\nNeighbors and school officials said federal officers used the child as “bait,” telling him to knock on his house’s door so his mother would come out. DHS disputed that description.\n\nMarcos Charles, acting executive associate director of ICE enforcement and removal operations, faulted the father for “abandoning his child in the middle of winter in a vehicle.” He told reporters one officer stayed with the child while others arrested the father.\n\nThe government said the boy’s father entered the U.S. illegally from Ecuador in December 2024. The family’s lawyer said he has a pending asylum claim that allows him to stay in the U.S.\n\nThe vast majority of asylum-seekers are released in the United States, with adults having eligibility for work permits, while their cases wind through a backlogged court system.\n\nEcuadorians, who left in droves in recent years as their country spiraled into violence, have fared poorly in immigration court, with judges granting asylum in 12.5% of decisions in the 12-month period through September, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering and research organization based at Syracuse University.\n\nIn ordering the release of Liam and his father, U.S. District Judge Fred Biery blasted the administration, writing that the case had “its genesis in the ill-conceived and incompetently-implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatizing children.”\n\nThe Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review’s online court docket shows no future hearings for Liam’s father.",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M's (17-4, 7-1 SEC) NCAA Tournament resume is looking better every week, as the Aggies are riding a four-game winning streak in SEC play after defeating Georgia on the road 92-77 behind another balanced scoring effort resulting in five players scoring in double figures, led by senior forward Rashaun Agee's 18 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists, recorded his tenth double-double of the season.\n\nUnder first-year head coach Bucky McMillan, the Aggies aren't lacking confidence, and after losing a close game to SMU on the road during the latter half of non-conference play, Texas A&M has lost just one game since, dropping a double-overtime road matchup vs. Tennessee, which should have gone the other way if free throws and questionable officiating weren't an issue.\n\nLeading the SEC at 7-1, three of Texas A&M's conference wins are Quad 1A victories, which, according to the NCAA NET rankings, are wins against teams ranked in the top 15 ranked teams at home, top 25 on a neutral court, and top 40 on the road in the NET standings. Tied with Tennessee and Kentucky, here are the SEC teams with more than one Quad 1A win.\n\nOver the next four games against Alabama (road), Florida (home), Missouri (road), and Vanderbilt (road), Texas A&M will have three Quad 1A opportunities, and winning one, or two of these tough matchups would likely guarentee the Aggies an at-large bid in the NCAA Tournament, especially given the fact that McMillan's squad is a perfect 12-0 in Quad 3 and Quad 3 games.\n\nAfter Florida blew out Alabama 100-77 on Sunday night, Texas A&M has a chance to take advantage of the Crimson Tide's short turnaround before playing on Wednesday, but needs to play with the same mentality, and shoot at least 45% from the field, and hit free throws to have a chance at pulling off the upset.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M basketball's three Quad 1A wins tied for most in the SEC",

Steinbrenner III, the principal owner and managing partner of the New York Yankees for more than three decades.\n\n“You were great! You tell it like it is,” Steinbrenner wrote. “It is like I said to Stephen, you should run for President some day and get the whole damn thing straightened out.”\n\nIn yet another post, the president daydreamed over a rendering of his planned “Arc de Trump.”\n\nThe president also posted endorsements he had made in races in New Hampshire and Indiana.\n\nIn the case of Texas’ 9th State Senate District, however, Trump’s Truth Social endorsements didn’t carry Wambsganss to victory.\n\nTrump endorsed Wambsganss in three posts made between early Friday morning and Saturday afternoon.\n\n“Today is the day!” Trump wrote on Saturday. “To all Voters in Texas’ 9th State Senate District: GET OUT AND VOTE for a phenomenal Candidate, Leigh Wambsganss. She is a highly successful Entrepreneur, and an incredible supporter of our Movement to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.”\n\nAfter Wambsganss lost, Trump pretended to be blissfully unaware of the election he had made three posts about.\n\n“I don’t know. I didn’t hear about it,” he told reporters in Mar-a-Lago on Sunday.\n\n“I’m not involved in that. That’s a local Texas race. You mean I won by 17 [points], and this person lost?” he said before shrugging. “Things like that happen.”",

Menefee’s win will, at least temporarily, narrow that gap.\n\nSixteen candidates ran to fill the remainder of Turner’s term in the House after he died in March, though none received a majority of votes. Turner, who was first elected to Congress in November 2024 and died last year, had himself succeeded the late Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D), after she died the July prior.\n\nMenefee will serve the remainder of Turner’s term, but will then run again for a full term for the seat in March after the district was redrawn last year.

    "fullText": "Texas A&M (17-4, 7-1 SEC) should be undefeated in SEC play if it weren't for missed free throws down the stretch of the double-overtime loss at Tennessee, as the Aggies have not lost since, and while efficient shooting, paired with improved rebounding have certainly aided the team, resulting in three straight double-digit wins, first-year head coach Bucky McMillan deserve a ton of credit for gearing the focus back to the free throw line.\n\nAs a team, the Aggies are shooting 74.8% from the stripe, while Spanish sharpshooter Ruben Dominguez leads the team at 90%, while six players are shooting 80% or better.\n\nOn Saturday, the Aggies earned their third Quad 1A win after defeating Georgia on the road 92-77, and shot 45% from the field, and 38% from beyond the arc, and outside of winning the rebounding battle 46-39, Texas A&M finished an impressive 19-20 from the free-throw line, and was perfect in the final minutes of the second half.\n\nDuring former head coach Buzz Williams' career in College Station, the Aggies struggled at the free throw line, which directly led to frustrating losses in and out of conference play, and while the offense never flourished under Williams like we've seen under McMillan this season, free throws continued to make or break outcomes for every team, no matter the play style.\n\n\"Bucky Ball\" is built on three-point shooting and high-percentage shots near the rim, while the press defense, comically dubbed the \"mother-in-law\" defense by McMillan, has continued to force turnovers, leading to fast-break points and big leads over the last three games.\n\nStill, in the last three wins, the Aggies were nearly perfect from the free throw line, converting 51-54 attempts for a 94.4% success rate, which, combined with 39 three-pointers, Texas A&M's offense has looked unstoppable, and will continue to score 90 points or more if this success at the stripe continues in conference play.\n\nWhile the size differential is notable over the next two games against Alabama on the road and Florida at home, Texas A&M's fast-paced play style frustrated Auburn and Texas, who both possessed more size in the paint, and if the Aggies continue to convert at the free throw line, anything is possible moving forward.\n\nOver its last three games combined, Texas A&M men's basketball is 51 of 54 (94.4%) from the free throw line.

    "fullText": "The Buffs have remained aggressive in the portal, so here’s a top five you need to know right now. We’ll count down from No. 5 to No. 1 and hit why each addition fits, and how they raise the floor this fall.\n\nLefau is a senior transfer from Texas who comes to Boulder looking to revitalize the Buffs pass rush. He posted 26 tackles and 1 sack last year, and more importantly spent time in one of the best pass rushing groups in the nation. That experience matters for a defense that will be rebuilt front to back. His veteran voice and habits are vital for a unit that has started slow in recent seasons because so many portal additions had to gel at once. Experience is the point here, and it is going to be key across the entire defense.\n\nYes, the name and backstory drew headlines, but the on-field production backs it up. Lampron is a journeyman senior who tallied 65 tackles, 2.5 sacks, and 2 forced fumbles last season for Bowling Green. The origin story matters too, as Lampron randomly ran into Coach Prime on a plane a few months ago and gave coach his pitch. Prime’s staff did the homework, and Lampron had an offer before they even deboarded. With the Buffs staring at a completely new defensive unit next season; Lampron brings toughness, proven production, and immediate special teams value to steady that transition.\n\nScudero arrives in Boulder after turning in one of the best sophomore campaigns in the country with nearly 1,300 receiving yards and 11 touchdowns. At 5’9, 175, he wins with agility, quickness, and crisp route running. In Brennan Marion’s system he’s a plug-and-play starting slot, the kind of chain-mover who keeps JuJu on schedule and punishes single coverage. He is also one of the most talented portal additions Boulder has seen in the last few years, so there is no reason to think he won’t be on the field from the first series in the fall.\n\nCarter arrives from Tennessee, a hometown Vol who had a real path to playing time in the SEC, which tells you the offer to come to Boulder was serious, and for good reason. He was ranked the No. 5 safety in the transfer portal and his tape backs it up. Last season he played like a ball magnet, forcing three fumbles and breaking up three passes. For a Buffs team that has struggled to force turnovers, and just lost turnover-creator Tawfiq Byard, Carter was a must-sign for Deion Sanders. He has two years of eligibility left, but may need to produce immediately in a playmaking-needy back end.\n\nA St. John Bosco grad, Moore comes to Boulder with one year of eligibility and a top-ten transfer grade (No. 8 in the portal). At Texas he stacked just under 1,000 yards and 11 touchdowns across the last two seasons as a starting wideout. His 6’0, 190 frame is not about freak measurables, as it is the ideal all-purpose receiver body that lets Brennan Marion fit him seamlessly into the Go-Go offense. After the departures of Omarion Miller, Sincere Brown, and others, Moore is expected to have the biggest season of any incoming transfer. Personally, I think he profiles as the X reciever, where he’ll be expected to win outside the numbers, on slants, digs, comebacks, and posts. Moore has the experience, production, and frame to be JuJu Lewis’s No. 1 target come September.",

    "title": "Texas A&M Ends Women's Studies and Overhauls Classes Over Race and Gender",
    "description": "New policies limiting the teaching of race and gender issues led administrators and professors to change hundreds of courses. School leaders say the rules could hurt A&M’s reputation.",
    "fullText": "Texas A&M University said on Friday that it would end its women’s and gender studies program, and that the syllabuses for hundreds of courses had been altered under new policies limiting how race and gender ideology may be discussed in classrooms.\n\nThe university said that six courses had been canceled entirely because of the new rules, out of the roughly 5,400 that were planned for this semester at one of the nation’s largest public universities.\n\nThe A&M system’s regents — all of them appointed by Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican — approved the restrictive policies late last year, and officials have been scrambling since then to interpret and enforce them. Supporters contend that the rules are appropriate measures to prevent political ideologies, especially those often associated with the left, from entering classrooms. Opponents say the approach encourages self-censorship and is itself ideological.\n\nA top-down demand to scrutinize a university’s entire course catalog in so short a time is extraordinarily rare in the United States, where professors have long had sweeping control over their syllabuses.\n\n“I have never seen anything like this,” said Leonard Bright, a professor in A&M’s Bush School of Government and Public Service and the president of the American Association of University Professors chapter in College Station, where the A&M system has its flagship campus of more than 74,000 students.\n\nThe regents do not seem interested in the academic freedom of students and the faculty, he added, only the “freedom of their speech.”\n\nFriday’s announcement about shutting down the university’s women’s and gender studies program went beyond the immediate repercussions that many people had anticipated.\n\nTommy Williams, the university’s interim president, said in a statement that he had directed the closure because of low enrollment and “the difficulty of bringing the program in compliance with the new system policies.” He said that students who were already pursuing degrees or certificates in the program would be able to complete them.\n\nIn 2024, the regents ordered A&M to drop its minor in L.G.B.T.Q. studies. But ending a full bachelor’s degree program represents a sharp escalation in the debate over what should be taught at public universities in Texas, the nation’s most populous conservative state.\n\nA&M is not the first school to drop gender studies. New College of Florida, for example, moved in 2023 to shut down its program, which had operated for decades.\n\nUntil Friday, discussions at A&M had often focused on how individual courses this semester would be affected by the new limits, which Mr. Williams argued in an interview this week had “restored rigor into some areas where maybe we had had some drift.”\n\n“This has given us a transparent way to go through and make sure that what we’re advertising the course is about is actually what’s being taught,” he said on Tuesday, adding that the approach “strengthens academic integrity, it protects our academic standards and, I think, most importantly, it builds trust in higher education.”\n\nA&M officials have nevertheless been bracing for recriminations, including possible court challenges, and for prospective students or professors to be thinking twice about heading to College Station.\n\n“It’s been harmful to our reputation, there’s no question about that,” said Mr. Williams, a Republican former state legislator. “But I think it’s transitory.”\n\nMr. Williams, who previously worked for Mr. Abbott, said he had not discussed the policies with the governor. And during the interview, Mr. Williams did not mention any plans concerning the women’s and gender studies program, which currently has 28 students enrolled in its major.\n\nUnder the new systemwide policies, no A&M course may “advocate race or gender ideology, or topics related to sexual orientation or gender identity.” Certain classes that are not part of the core curriculum may include teaching about those subjects, but only if a campus president agrees that there is “a necessary educational purpose.”\n\nAsked whether any part of him believed that the policies went too far, Mr. Williams replied, “No.” Pressed on whether deans and department heads would share that view, Mr. Williams responded, “Some would and some would not.”\n\nFor the most part, those deans and department heads have been the ones trying to navigate how far A&M should go in excising content.\n\n“Day by day, we began to have a clearer understanding of where the line may be,” said Simon North, the interim dean of the College of Arts and Sciences in College Station.\n\nDr. North acknowledged, though, that it was impossible to know exactly how many courses had been affected because some faculty members may have modified their syllabuses themselves.\n\n“There are actions that people took in consultation with us,” Dr. North said, “and there are actions that people may have done on their own.”\n\nSyllabus reviews largely took place at the departmental and college levels, but some reached the interim president’s desk. As he prepared this week to weigh requests for exemptions, Mr. Williams said that “common sense is what we’re trying to use as our gauge.”\n\nHe said that A&M officials were not looking to cut material in ways that might prevent students from being competitive in the marketplace, and that opponents of the new rules had “confused what academic freedom is.”\n\n“It doesn’t mean you get to do whatever you want to in the classroom,” he said. “You have academic freedom, but it comes along with the responsibility, and part of that responsibility is to make sure that the learning outcomes are achieved and they’re done in a way that’s compliant with state and federal law and what our regents mandate us to do.”\n\nEven before the wholesale course review, Texas A&M was debating what content was appropriate in college classrooms. In September, the university fired a lecturer for displaying a gender unicorn — which is used to explain the differences between gender expression and gender identity — during a course on children’s literature. The president of the university at the time — Mr. Williams’s predecessor — quickly stepped down.\n\nA faculty appeals panel ruled that the university was “not justified” when it ousted the lecturer, Melissa McCoul, but A&M has refused to reinstate her.\n\nThen the regents’ policies deepened the turmoil. One of the largest ruptures unspooled in the philosophy department, after a professor, Martin Peterson, proposed including portions of Plato’s Symposium in a contemporary moral issues course that can be used to fulfill a core curriculum requirement.\n\nHe also scheduled teaching modules covering race and gender ideology. He had discussed similar topics in the course in the past, though previous syllabuses showed that the modules had different names, like “race and gender issues.”\n\nKristi Sweet, the head of the philosophy department, asked him to “mitigate” the course to remove that content, or face reassignment to a different class. After the dispute became public, university officials repeatedly suggested that Dr. Peterson had constructed his syllabus as a provocation.\n\nDr. Peterson acknowledged that he had wanted to “test the waters,” but he said in an interview this week that he thought the Platonic passages would be less contentious than material he had assigned in the past: an excerpt from the Supreme Court ruling that recognized a right to same-sex marriage. He has since replaced the disputed modules and Plato readings with lessons about academic freedom.\n\nAdministrators note that Plato appears in the syllabuses for other classes.\n\n“Hundreds of Aggies are reading Plato in their courses right now,” Dr. Sweet said. She added that the entirety of Plato’s Symposium was being taught in the Philosophy of Art course, and that despite a wide outcry over its handling of the Peterson class, the department’s “strategic priorities for continued excellence are untouched by current events.”\n\nDr. Bright, the A.A.U.P. chapter president, has faced questions about his own courses. Administrators initially flagged an article that included discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity. But the dean of the Bush School, John Sherman, told Dr. Bright that administrators would support letting him use that text, “given the scholarly nature of the work and the applicability of the reading.”\n\nAnother of Dr. Bright’s courses worried administrators more.\n\nDr. Bright wrote that the course would examine the impact of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation and other social identities “on public policy and the professional ethical responsibilities of public servants.”\n\nDr. Sherman asked him how sexual orientation would be covered. After Dr. Bright responded that it was impossible to say exactly when the subject might come up in a discussion-driven course, the dean canceled the class.\n\n“To say this gives me no pleasure is an understatement,” Dr. Sherman wrote. “To be clear, transparency does not equate to censorship.”\n\nDr. Bright said that university leaders had made an impossible demand about a course that is often shaped by current events.\n\nIt is rare for university governing boards to make decisions that reach so far into classrooms so quickly. Still, R. Bowen Loftin, a former A&M president, said there were few practical options available to campus officials who might disagree with the regents.\n\n“When you become an administrator, especially at a public institution, there’s going to be limits on what you can say and what you can do, and you have to come to grips with that,” he said.\n\nDr. North, the arts and sciences dean, said “questions of academic freedom and academic responsibilities are really difficult,” but that he was “trying to implement these changes in a way that puts students first and supports faculty.”\n\nDr. Bright showed little patience with such defenses.\n\n“When it comes to certain things, you’ve got to say no,” he said. “I don’t excuse administrators from that responsibility.”",

    "fullText": "One week after her 8-year-old son was killed in a crash along Highway 114 in Wise County, a Rhome mother is calling on the state to make changes she believes could prevent another tragedy.\n\nHer son, Matteo Rodriguez, was riding home from school last Thursday, sitting in the passenger seat with his grandmother, when their vehicle was struck at the intersection of Highway 114 and Alliance Boulevard in Rhome, also known as County Road 4841.\n\nWise County EMS said the crash happened as the vehicle was turning and a three-quarter-ton truck his grandmother could not see. The truck struck the passenger side, hitting Matteo.\n\nThe second grader at Prairie View Elementary School in Northwest ISD lost his pulse at the scene.\n\nFirst responders were able to revive him, and he was airlifted to Cook Children’s Medical Center. However, Matteo died during the flight.\n\n“At first I was shocked,” his mother said. “I was like, no. Don’t say that.”\n\nShe said Matteo’s grandmother immediately blamed herself.\n\n“She said, ‘I killed your son,’” Matteo’s mother said. “She blamed herself from the very first moment.”\n\nNow, Matteo’s mother is pushing for change at the intersection where her son was killed. She has launched a Change.org petition calling on the Texas Department of Transportation to install a traffic signal at the busy crossing. As of this week, the petition has gathered more than 9,000 signatures.\n\nWhen asked if a traffic light could have made a difference, she did not hesitate.\n\n“Yes,” she said. “Totally. With all my heart.”\n\nWFAA reached out to TxDOT about the incident, but has not received a response.\n\nMatteo’s mother is a Kindergarten teacher at his elementary school. She said her last moments with him were simple and joyful.\n\nA student had gifted her a small ladybug stuffed animal, and Matteo was excited to take it home.\n\n“I told him, remember you have the ladybug,” she said. “Put it in your backpack so we can bring it back tomorrow. He left so happy.”\n\nAfter Matteo died, she noticed something that stopped her.\n\n“When I entered the hospital room, he had the ladybug on his shoulder,” she said. “The ladybug came back to me, but not him.”\n\nMatteo was her youngest child, born after she suffered a miscarriage.\n\n“They ripped part of my heart,” she said. “I won’t be able to see my kid graduate.”\n\nDespite the grief, she says she will keep pushing for change, hoping Matteo’s story leads to action and saves lives.\n\n“I don’t want another family to go through this,” she said.",

    "fullText": "EL PASO, Texas (KTSM) — El Paso District Court Judge Marlene Gonzalez is stepping back from cases involving migrant children, following allegations that she behaved impartially and prejudiced toward them in hearings.\n\n“As a judge, the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct prevents me from submitting to an interview or commenting on a case that I have recused myself from hearing. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to provide this response,” read a statement from Gonzalez who noted she voluntarily recused herself from hearings regarding unaccompanied migrant children’s cases.\n\nOn Dec. 17, 2025, attorneys from Estrella del Paso – an immigrant advocacy organization – filed a motion to recuse Gonzalez from hearings involving unaccompanied migrant children – children entering the U.S. illegally and without a parent or guardian.\n\nIn the court filing, attorneys and social services workers with the organization submitted written declarations detailing allegations that Gonzalez showed a “pattern and practice of cruelty” towards migrant children during the hearings.\n\nThe declarations made allegations that Gonzalez would subject children to humiliating interrogations about why they left their country, and that on multiple occasions she shamed the children for abandoning their parents.\n\nIn one account an attorney alleged that Gonzalez interrogated a 17-year-old Guatemalan boy who testified that he fled his country to Mexico from an abusive alcoholic father, but that he was kidnapped and beat up twice while in Mexico. The attorney alleged that in response, Gonzalez “harangued” the boy: “Why didn’t you stay in another part of Mexico? It’s beautiful, and it’s big. Why didn’t you stay in another part of Mexico?” the document read.\n\nIn another hearing involving a 16-year old Venezuelan girl from Venezuela who had been a victim of child prostitution, an attorney alleged that Gonzalez scolded the child “not to engage in prostitution.”\n\nThe filing went on to note that despite these alleged practices by Gonzalez, she would “unexpectedly” grant children their petitions seeking Special Immigrant Juvenile Visas, but that she recently began denying the petitions without providing any reasoning in 2025.\n\nEstrella del Paso declined an interview request with KTSM and instead offered the following statement:\n\n“For nearly 40 years, Estrella del Paso has provided legal representation and other legal services to immigrants in El Paso. We are a non-profit law firm. As attorneys, we take our legal and ethical duties to our clients very seriously, and we file every motion and document with the court with these duties in mind. The motion filed includes several detailed examples that our legal team took time and detailed care to compile. For accuracy and completeness, we encourage you to refer directly to that filing. We will not comment on the motions or our interactions with the court. All our clients are owed a duty of confidentiality, and we will not violate this duty, especially in the case of vulnerable children.”\n\nGonzalez’s current term runs through 2028.",

    "description": "A Nicaraguan man who died at a troubled Texas detention camp days after he was detained by immigration agents in Minnesota appeared to have died by suicide, according to a 911 call and records released Wednesday.  Victor Manuel Diaz, 36, was found by guards on Jan. 14 in a room at Camp East Montana in El Paso, Texas, after he tried to die by suicide, a camp official reported on a 911 call obtained by The Associated Press through a public information request.  “They were doing rounds and they just found him with his pants tied up to his neck, I believe,” said the caller, who identified himself as a health administrator named Luis Gonzalez.",
    "fullText": "Victor Manuel Diaz, 36, was found by guards on Jan. 14 in a room at Camp East Montana in El Paso, Texas, after he tried to die by suicide, a camp official reported on a 911 call obtained by The Associated Press through a public information request.\n\n“They were doing rounds and they just found him with his pants tied up to his neck, I believe,” said the caller, who identified himself as a health administrator named Luis Gonzalez.\n\nDiaz’s death was at least the third of a detainee housed at Camp East Montana, which opened last year at Fort Bliss to hold 5,000 detainees in the desert near the U.S.-Mexico border. Advocates for detainees have alleged a pattern of violence, abuse and neglect at the camp. One earlier death has been ruled a homicide.\n\nRandall Kallinen, an attorney for Diaz's family, said they are suspicious of the claim that his death was a suicide because he was not depressed and would have been reunited with his mother, two sons and siblings in Nicaragua if he had been deported.\n\n“Even if it is suicide, was there something that happened to him that drove him to suicide?” Kallinen asked. “There still has to be an investigation.”\n\nMessages seeking comment were left with ICE on Wednesday.\n\nGonzalez did not witness Diaz's suicide attempt. A separate report by emergency medical services that was released Wednesday said Diaz was suspected of hanging himself with a bed sheet. Federal authorities have not released the findings of an autopsy, but have said the death was a “presumed suicide.”\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement picked up Diaz on Jan. 6 as agents fanned out across Minneapolis looking for people who may be in the country illegally. He was then sent to the sprawling Texas tent complex.\n\nDiaz crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in 2024, requested asylum and was released. A judge later ordered his removal after he didn’t show up for an immigration hearing, according to ICE.\n\nRelatives in Nicaragua lost contact with Diaz after he went to work at a suburban restaurant on Jan. 6 and later learned he'd been detained. They received a call on Jan. 15 from ICE saying Diaz was dead. Family members “were in disbelief,” said Carlos Morales, board president of Texas Nicaraguan Community, a nonprofit that helped the family raise money to repatriate Diaz's remains to Nicaragua.\n\nA coalition of groups and a Democratic congresswoman who represents El Paso have called for Camp East Montana to be closed.\n\nSome of those calls came after the Jan. 3 death of 55-year-old Cuba native Geraldo Lunas Campos. A medical examiner has ruled that a homicide, citing physical restraint by guards.\n\nA witness has described guards pinning Lunas Campos to the ground in handcuffs, with one restraining him in a chokehold until he could no longer breathe. ICE has said the guards intervened to try to help Lunas Campos after he attempted suicide, and that he resisted them. A camp official initially told police it was a suicide.\n\nLawyers for the family of Lunas Campos have asked a judge for an emergency order to prevent ICE from deporting detainees who witnessed the struggle.\n\nICE, which oversees the camp, announced Diaz’s death on Jan. 18, saying security staff “found Diaz unconscious and unresponsive in his room.” The agency said he “died of a presumed suicide” but that the cause was still under investigation.\n\nIn addition to Lunas Campos and Diaz, ICE announced that on Dec. 3 an immigrant from Guatemala held in Camp East Montana died after being transferred to a El Paso hospital for care. The agency said Francisco Gaspar-Andres, 48, was suspected to have died of liver and kidney failure.\n\nUnlike with the two prior deaths, Diaz’s body wasn’t sent to the county medical examiner in El Paso for an autopsy. Kallinen said an Armed Forces pathologist conducted the autopsy at Fort Bliss, and that he's been told it could take months for findings to be released.\n\nThe 911 caller in the case told the dispatcher that a team of doctors and nurses were working to try to revive Diaz after his suicide attempt and they needed an ambulance.\n\nParamedics found him laying on his back in a hospital bed without a heartbeat, according to an El Paso Fire Department incident report.\n\nAP reporter Michael Biesecker contributed from Washington.",

    "fullText": "HOUSTON (AP) — A Texas man who at one time escaped from custody and was on the run for three days after being sentenced to death for fatally shooting his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend nearly 27 years ago was scheduled on Wednesday to be the first person executed in the U.S. this year.\n\nCharles Victor Thompson was condemned for the April 1998 shooting deaths of his ex-girlfriend, Glenda Dennise Hayslip, 39; and her new boyfriend, Darren Keith Cain, 30, at her apartment in the Houston suburb of Tomball.\n\nThompson, 55, was scheduled to receive a lethal injection Wednesday evening at the state penitentiary in Huntsville.\n\nProsecutors say Thompson and Hayslip had been romantically involved for a year but split after Thompson “became increasingly possessive, jealous and abusive.”\n\nAccording to court records, Hayslip and Cain were dating when Thompson came to Hayslip’s apartment and began arguing with Cain around 3 a.m. the night of the killings. Police were called and told Thompson to leave the apartment complex. Thompson returned three hours later and shot both Hayslip and Cain, who died at the scene. Hayslip died in the hospital a week later.\n\n“The Hayslip and Cain families have waited over twenty-five years for justice to occur,” prosecutors with the Harris County District Attorney’s Office said in court filings.\n\nThompson’s attorneys have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stay his execution, arguing Thompson was not allowed to refute or confront the prosecution's evidence that concluded Hayslip died from a gunshot wound to the face. Thompson's attorneys have argued Hayslip actually died from flawed medical care she received after the shooting that resulted in severe brain damage sustained from oxygen deprivation following a failed intubation.\n\nThe Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles on Monday denied Thompson’s request to commute his death sentence to a lesser penalty.\n\n“If he had been able to raise a reasonable doubt as to the cause of Ms. Hayslip’s death, he would not be guilty of capital murder,” Thompson’s attorneys said in court filings with the Supreme Court.\n\nProsecutors said a jury has already rejected the claim and, concluded under state law that Thompson is responsible for Hayslip’s death because it “would not have occurred but for his conduct.”\n\nHayslip’s family had filed a lawsuit against one of her doctors, alleging medical negligence during her treatment left her brain-dead. A jury in 2002 found in favor of the doctor.\n\nThompson had his death sentence overturned and had a new punishment trial held in November 2005. A jury again ordered him to die by lethal injection.\n\nShortly after being resentenced, Thompson escaped from the Harris County Jail in Houston by walking out the front door virtually unchallenged by deputies. Thompson later told The Associated Press that after meeting with his attorney in a small interview cell, he slipped out of his handcuffs and orange jail jumpsuit and left the room, which was unlocked. Thompson waived an ID badge fashioned out of his prison ID card to get past several deputies.\n\n“I got to smell the trees, feel the wind in my hair, grass under my feet, see the stars at night. It took me straight back to childhood being outside on a summer night,” Thompson said about his three days on the run during a 2005 interview with the AP. He was arrested in Shreveport, Louisiana, while trying to arrange for wire transfers of money from overseas so he could make it to Canada.\n\nIf the execution is carried out, Thompson would be the first person put to death this year in the United States. Texas has historically held more executions than any other state, though Florida had the most executions in 2025, with 19.\n\nFollow Juan A. Lozano: https://x.com/juanlozano70",

    "title": "3 Texas A&M matchups ranked in ESPN's top 100 games of the 2025 season",
    "description": "ESPN's Top 100 games during the 2025 season includes two memorable Texas A&M wins, while the CFP loss to Miami is ranked higher than expected.",
    "fullText": "Texas A&M's 2025 football season was a mixed bag for most of the fan base, but it was historic nonetheless, as second-year head coach Mike Elko and his veteran squad reeled off 11 consecutive wins, including road victories over Notre Dame, LSU, and Missouri.\n\nHowever, back-to-back losses to Texas in Austin and Miami in the first round of the College Football Playoff, the program's first postseason appearance was a major disappointment given the circumstances, the advantage of playing in Kyle Field, while starting quarterback Marcel Reed failed to connect on several throws that would have given the Aggies the lead.\n\nStill, the wind, which was even worse on the field, affected both teams, but thanks to a healthy running game, combined with Texas A&M's inability to stop the run late in the game, Miami running back Mark Fletcher racked up over 150 yards, leading to the Hurricanes finding the endzone, and ultimately winning the game 10-3. Yes, Miami made it all the way to the National Championship, but the Aggies had every chance to pull out the victory.\n\nCoupled with the insane comeback win over South Carolina, ESPN's Bill Connelly placed three of Texas A&M's memorable matchups on his top 100 games of the 2025 season, starting with the first-round playoff loss to Miami, which he surprisingly placed at No. 16, even though this was a slog fest before Miami's final drive in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"Maybe the most aesthetically ... unique game of the season. Before Miami could make a run to the CFP championship game, the Hurricanes had to survive impossibly windy conditions (and a strong Texas A&M defense) in College Station. Carson Beck threw for only 103 yards, and the teams combined to miss four of six field goal attempts. Malachi Toney lost a key fourth-quarter fumble, but a 56-yard Mark Fletcher Jr. run set up Toney's redemption moment -- an 11-yard jet sweep TD with 1:44 left. Texas A&M rallied, driving 70 yards in just 1:20, but Bryce Fitzgerald picked off a third-and-goal pass in the end zone, and Miami advanced.\"\n\nComing in at No. 11, Texas A&M's 31-30 win over South Carolina did not end up being the catalyst many of us thought it would be, but it will be remembered as one of the greatest comebacks of all time, regardless of how the season finished out. Trailing 30-3 at the half, the Aggies went from playing their worst football of the year to looking like an unstoppable force on both sides of the ball.\n\n\"It was the biggest comeback in Texas A&M history, without which the Aggies probably wouldn't have made the playoff. It was also a day that featured both the worst and best halves of Marcel Reed's career. In the first half, he completed only 6 of 19 passes with two terrible interceptions and two sacks, one of which produced a fumble returned for a score by Nick Barrett. LaNorris Sellers threw a 50-yard touchdown to Vandrevius Jacobs and an 80-yarder to Nyck Harbor (complete with a really strange interaction with a state trooper), and the Gamecocks cruised into halftime up 30-3.\n\nIn the second half, A&M woke up, and the Gamecocks clammed up. Reed went 16-for-20 for 298 yards and three third-quarter touchdowns -- 27 yards to Izaiah Williams, 39 to Ashton Bethel-Roman, 14 to Nate Boerkircher -- and the Aggies gained 371 yards while allowing 76. They needed only 20 minutes to take a 31-30 lead, and South Carolina could never mount a rally. It was the most strangely straightforward 27-point comeback you'll ever see.\"\n\nLastly, at No. 4, Texas A&M's most important win of the season was going on the road in Week 3 against a 0-1 Notre Dame team that had lost a close road battle against Miami the week prior.\n\nHaving not won a ranked non-conference road game in over 40 years, a botched snap on an extra point, paired with Marcel Reed driving the Aggies down the field, finding tight end Nate Boerkircher for the game-tying touchdown, was by far the most exciting moment of the 2025 season outside of Indiana winning its first national title.\n\n\"A botched PAT snap and hold might have made the difference in a playoff bid. Texas A&M led 28-24 after a wild first half, and after a reasonably tame third quarter, the action picked up again late. With the score tied at 34-34, Jeremiyah Love capped a 12-play, six-minute drive with a 12-yard touchdown, but a botched hold on the PAT left the Irish's lead at just six points. A third-down scramble from Marcel Reed and a defensive holding penalty gave A&M a first-and-goal, but that quickly became fourth-and-goal from the 11. No worries -- with 19 seconds left, Reed found Nate Boerkircher for the game-winner. (Well, I guess Randy Bond's PAT was the actual game winner, but still.)\"\n\nTexas A&M will open the 2026 season against Missouri State on Saturday, September 5.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions.

    "fullText": "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is ordering state agencies and public universities in Texas to halt H-1B hiring, the latest setback for foreign workers looking to work in the US.\n\nIn a letter to Texas state agency heads on Tuesday, Abbott wrote that there had been \"recent reports of abuse\" in the H-1B visa program, which is designed to bring high-skilled foreign workers to the US.\n\n\"Texas taxpayers invest billions to train our workforce,\" Abbott wrote on X. \"Those jobs should go to Texans.\"\n\nAbbott is also directing agencies and universities to provide information on how many petitions they submitted in 2025, how many visa holders they currently sponsor, their countries of origin, and more.\n\nThe freeze is set to last through May 2027, and includes exceptions for instances in which written permission from the Texas Workforce Commission is given.\n\n\"Rather than serving its intended purpose of attracting the best and brightest individuals from around the world to our nation to fill truly specialized and unmet labor needs, the program has too often been used to fill jobs that otherwise could—and should— have been filled by Texans,\" Abbott wrote.\n\nTexas has the second-most H-1B visa holders, trailing only California.\n\nAs of 2025, more than 40,000 beneficiaries were approved to work for more than 6,100 employers, according to data from US Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nAccording to that data, at least 1,200 H-1B visa holders work at various public universities in the state, including the University of Texas system, Texas A&M University, Texas Tech, and others.\n\nThe top employers for H-1B visa holders in Texas are IT companies and tech firms, including Oracle and Tesla.\n\nThe governor's directive comes as President Donald Trump's administration has upended the H-1B visa program more broadly.\n\nIn September, Trump moved to impose a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visas, initially causing chaos at some major tech companies amid confusion over whether that fee applies to current employees who leave the country.\n\nThe administration rolled out social media screening requirements for visa holders in December, leading some firms to warn their employees against traveling outside the country.\n\nH-1B visas have proven to be a divisive issue within Trump's coalition, with some — most notably Elon Musk — arguing that the US must continue to bring in foreign talent to remain globally competitive.\n\nProminent business leaders who previously worked in the US under an H-1B visa include Musk, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Arista Networks CEO Jayshree Ullal, and Jeffrey Skoll, the first president of eBay.",

    "fullText": "Tech chiefs waxed poetic about AI to delegates at Davos. Plus, the ‘human’ drama of AI startups and why Tesla is thriving in Texas\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. This week’s edition is a team effort: my colleague Heather Stewart reports on the plans for AI’s world domination at Davos; I examine how huge investments have followed AI companies with little to their names but drama and dreams; and Nick Robins-Early spotlights how lax regulation of autonomous driving in Texas allowed Tesla to thrive.\n\nWhen they weren’t discussing Donald Trump, delegates at the World Economic Forum last week were being dazzled by the prospects for artificial intelligence.\n\nUp and down the main street of the Swiss Alps town, almost every shopfront was temporarily emblazoned with the neon slogan of a tech firm – or a consultancy promising to tell executives how to incorporate AI into their business. Cloudflare’s wood-panelled HQ urged delegates to “connect, protect and build together”, and Wipro’s shouted: “Dream Solve Prove Repeat.”\n\nAt the conference, tech CEOs laid out their hopes for how the physical manifestations of AI will blanket the world in the coming years. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella told a rapt audience about how “token factories”, as he calls datacenters, will have to be distributed across the world, to diffuse the benefits of AI globally.\n\n“To me, a long term, scalable solution is to have all of these token factories part of the real economy connected to the grid, connected to the telco network – and that’s what will drive that scale, whether it’s in the global south, or in the developed world,” Nadella said.\n\nMeanwhile Google was showing off the latest iteration of its Google Glasses to excited delegates; and there were endless sessions in the Davos congress centre about the technology’s potential benefits – including a breathless chat with late addition to the schedule Elon Musk, though with the SpaceX IPO apparently looming, he was keenest to talk about going to Mars.\n\nAway from the glitzy shopfronts, though, there was significant concern being expressed that all this proves to be an epic bubble.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, DeepMind chief Demis Hassabis warned that some aspects of AI investment do look, “bubble-like”, but insisted that, “if the bubble bursts, we [ie Google, not society at large] will be fine”.\n\nNadella offered one test for how we would know if it is a bubble – which I didn’t find reassuring. “A tell-tale sign of this as a bubble, is if all we’re talking about are the tech firms,” he said.\n\nMuch of Silicon Valley has been captivated over the past week by a “very human drama”, as the Wall Street Journal put it. Thinking Machines Lab, a startup founded by former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati, fired her own chief technology officer, Barret Zoph, over a relationship with a colleague and a recent lack of productivity, per the Journal. Within hours, her ex-employee – along with one of her co-founders and a third employee – had reportedly signed offers with OpenAI, which they left just last year to join her startup. The three had told her they disagreed with the direction of the company in the meeting that ended with Zoph’s firing, according to the Journal. For his part, Zoph told the Journal that Murati had fired him simply for telling her he was considering another job.\n\nAs dishy as the drama might be, the stakes of Murati’s mess differ from a juicy celebrity entanglement that might be chronicled in TMZ or Page Six, two of my favorite publications. The stakes in San Francisco are billions of real dollars and more than $10bn potential ones. Murati’s company has raised $2bn in venture capital since its founding in February 2025. It is valued at $12bn. The talent involved in these California productions – not movies but rather AI tools used by hundreds of millions of people – takes on superstar significance.\n\nThinking Machines has released one product, Tinker, in October 2025, meant to streamline the customization of large language models, a rather niche concern in comparison with ChatGPT’s ambitions to replace Google search or Claude’s coding aptitude.\n\nThe massive investment and resulting valuation are chasing little in terms of real offerings from the company. A new company profiled in the New York Times last week, Humans&, has naught but a dream, an ugly website – and several hundred million dollars. Researchers from Google, Anthropic, and Elon Musk’s xAI, including one who helped develop the notorious Grok AI tool, founded the company just three months ago. They aim to facilitate collaboration between humans and machines rather than separation – “innovations in long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning, memory, and user understanding”, per the site. If that sounds gauzy, it is because the company has not launched a product.\n\nHumans& has raised $480m from Nvidia, Jeff Bezos, and Google, per the New York Times. It is valued at $4.48bn. It has – say it with me one more time – not launched a product.\n\nWhatever fears of an AI bubble may be circulating, the money is still flowing, chasing after the future with an enormous but uncertain bet in the present.\n\nElon Musk announced last week that Tesla had removed human safety monitors from its Robotaxis in Austin, Texas, as the company moves to expand its autonomous vehicle business. As with most things Musk, the reality was a bit more complicated – Tesla’s vice-president of software later clarified on X that the company had deployed “a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors”.\n\nWhat Tesla’s test-run of fully driverless vehicles did highlight, however, was the difference between how much leeway Texas gives autonomous vehicles compared with California, the birthplace of autonomous driving in the US and the home of the highest number of self-driving cars in the country. The Texas department of motor vehicles does not have regulatory authority over autonomous vehicles in the state, instead autonomous vehicles are governed by the state’s transportation code. Although a new government authorization system for autonomous vehicles is set to be implemented in the coming months, there’s currently no application process required for autonomous vehicle operators in the state. \n\n “Autonomous vehicles on Texas roads are subject to all traffic laws and can be cited for safety violations, but do not yet require specific authorization to operate,” the Texas DMV said.\n\nAlso surprising is the state’s lack of regulations on operating an autonomous vehicle if it’s for personal, non-commercial use. As long as it complies with some stipulations, such as traffic laws and safety standards, an autonomous vehicle can drive around Texas without anyone in the car.\n\n “Any motor vehicle equipped with an automated driving system may operate in this state,” the Texas transportation code states. “An automated motor vehicle may operate in this state with the automated driving system engaged, regardless of whether a human driver is physically present in the automated motor vehicle.”\n\nMeanwhile in California, the state’s department of motor vehicles requires three stages of testing and permitting for commercial autonomous vehicles. Regulators are also in the process of considering new rules that could add even more requirements on vehicle operators. Tesla caused confusion last October when Musk announced a ride-hailing service in the Bay Area, only for regulators to say that the company did not have authorization to operate paid or unpaid autonomous rides to the public. On the Robotaxi section of Tesla’s website, it only mentions Texas.",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M's 2026 coaching staff is all but complete, but after ace recruiter Jordan Peterson, who also served as the program's longtime defensive backs coach, departed to join former offensive coordinator Collin Klein, now Kansas State's head coach, as the Wildcats' defensive coordinator, head coach Mike Elko has been in search of the team's new cornerbacks coach.\n\nWhile Ishmael Aristide is still on staff, AggieYell insider Jaxson Callaway reports and confirms that Elko is looking to make an external hire for the position after elevating wide receivers coach Holmon Wiggins to offensive coordinator and assistant Joey Lynch to quarterbacks coach late last month. This decision will be based on recruiting prowess, development background, and overall experience.\n\nAccording to Callaway, Mike Elko hoped to have a hire secured by this past weekend, but inclement weather across much of the country, including College Station, postponed recruiting visits, and the search for the new CB coach continues. While Elko has reportedly interviewed a host of candidates, including Georgia Tech defensive backs coach Cory Peoples, a name to watch has been kept under wraps.\n\nStill, Callaway stated that an announcement could and should be made this week, putting the finishing touches on a coaching staff that will lead the Aggies into the 2026 season. So far, the lone external hires are new tight ends coach Derek Shay, defensive line coach Elijah Robinson, and linebackers coach Travis Williams.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: On3's Jaxson Callaway provides update for Texas A&M's CB coach search",

    "fullText": "This past week was a weird one for upsets. We didn’t get any huge, unexpected upsets of top-tier teams. But we did have some small underdogs pull through on their opponent’s home floor, such as UNC beating Virginia, Texas Tech beating Houston, and Illinois beating Purdue. Let’s see what this week brings!\n\nThe Wildcats have sustained a lot of injuries in the past few weeks, but I don’t think that will matter in this one. We have seen that you beat Vanderbilt by using size and strength in the frontcourt, and this could be a breakout game for any of Malachi Moreno, Andrija Jelavic, or Mo Dioubate.\n\nThe Alabama Crimson Tide has a myriad of issues going on. Not only are they facing national scrutiny over the eligibility of Charles Bediako, but they also have injuries to Ajay Allen and Aden Holloway. I think there’s just too much going on with Alabama right now for them to be fully focused and engaged with this game, and Missouri has a breakout star emerging in T.O. Barrett.\n\nSean Miller’s Longhorns have shown that they have a high ceiling, coming off a 20-point win over a ranked Georgia team. Auburn has shown us a low floor, with a loss to Missouri already on the schedule. Miller has Dailyn Swain playing the best basketball of his career, and I think he plays a huge role as Texas continues their march to an NCAA Tournament bid in his first season.\n\nI’m going to hop back on my travel schedule soapbox here. Let’s get this straight: Florida State is not good. Cal is better. But FSU has Rodney McCray and Chauncey Wiggins, who both play well at home, and Cal has not won a game outside the state of California this season. I think the road trip gets the better of them here.\n\nSaint Louis is rolling right now — if not for a desperation 3-pointer at the buzzer by Stanford, the Billikens would be undefeated. But all good things must come to an end. The “Battle for the Archbaron’s Cup” has been anything but predictable over the years, and would make a great occasion for Dayton to pull off the upset. Dayton finally has their two centers, Amael L’Etang and Malcolm Thomas, healthy, and may also get back Jordan Derkack for this game.\n\nNFL: Super Bowl LX odds: Opening line for Patriots, Seahawks revealed\n\nCFB:Most impactful transfer of 2025 college football season\n\nNBA: NBA star Derrick Rose reacts after unexpected surprise ahead of jersey retirement\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: NFL’s crazy preseason Super Bowl LX graphic resurfaces\n\nTENNIS: Valentin Vacherot hits physics-defying shot at Australian Open\n\nVIRAL: Alex Honnold takes incredible selfie after historic Taipei 101 climb\n\nThe post Predicting upsets in College Basketball this week   appeared first on The Big Lead.",

The oil fields offshore Guyana, of which Exxon owns the largest stake, are considered among the most prolific oil discoveries of recent decades.\n\nThe Eagle Ford Shale is a rock formation in South Texas known for its significant oil and natural gas reserves.\n\nOther recent sales of Eagle Ford assets include Canadian producer BayTex Energy's $2.14 billion sale, which closed in December. Houston pipeline giant Kinder Morgan announced last week that it had solidified its own deal selling a $396 million stake in the area.\n\nThe oil and gas industry has seen a rush of layoffs over the last year, including from Exxon, as companies weather weak oil markets.\n\nExxon said in September it would lay off around 2,000 workers globally, though none of those layoffs are expected to include positions in the United States.\n\nThis article originally published at Eagle Ford on the chopping block as Exxon refocuses drilling strategy.",

    "fullText": "Alabama, Ole Miss, Tennessee and Texas A&M have emerged as the top four schools in the recruitment of Brentwood (Tenn.) Academy four-star safety Kenneth Simon II.\n\nThat’s no surprise, as he’s spoken about his interest in the quartet of programs with Rivals over the last few weeks. On Monday, he officially named them as his top four schools.\n\nSimon is the No. 226 overall prospect and No. 25 safety in the 2027 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all major recruiting media companies. He’s also the No. 10 recruit in Tennessee.\n\nWhen speaking with Rivals’ Sam Spiegelman earlier this month, Simon said that he was nearing his college commitment. He’s now made the next step and continues to work towards that decision.\n\n“It’s getting down to the wire,” Simon told Rivals. “I don’t know if it’ll be before or after (official visits). I have to talk about it with my family, but I’m close to the finish line. Checking out a few more details before I make the decision.”\n\nSimon, a Tennessee legacy, was back in Knoxville two weekends ago for the Vols’ junior day. He was then on A&M’s visit list over the weekend and is set to return to Tuscaloosa this weekend.\n\nAhead of competing at the Navy All-American Bowl earlier this month, Simon discussed his interest in his top four with Spiegelman:\n\nAlabama: “When you think of Alabama, you think of winning,” he started. “As long as I’ve been alive, they’ve been winning. The standard at ‘Bama — I wanna be a part of that standard. It’s held high and you always wanna go somewhere with a high standard. Coach (Kane) Womack and DeBoer, talking to them has been cool. They brought my family in and talked about my fit there, and it was fun.”\n\nOle Miss: “Coach (Jake) Schoonover saw me last year. He and I are real tight, and Coach (Jay) Shoop just got promoted. He used to work with my dad at Tennessee,” Simon said. “Pete Golding is smart and knows what he’s talking about when it comes to linebacker. Henry To’oto’o came from De La Salle High and played for Pete at Bama. He told me Coach Golding is one of the smartest dudes he ever sat in the meeting room with. Being around people like that, getting my ball knowledge up would help.”\n\nTennessee: “Coach Inge and I have a really good relationship. I grew up around Knoxville and Coach Inge is a great coach,” Simon said. “Coach (Josh) Heuepel is good at building relationships. Our relationship is very good. We talk about how I fit into their system schematically, and it’s everything I would wanna do in college, so I like that.”\n\nTexas A&M: “Coach Troop and I have a good relationship,” he said. “Coach (Mike) Elko is doing a great job, getting great players. Their recruiting class is insane right now. The defense is huge, it’s physical, and they play the right way. That’s what I like about A&M.”",

    "title": "'Super' Battleship USS Texas Relocating With A Major Facelift In 2026",
    "description": "The USS Texas has endured a lot since it was commissioned in 1914, and 2026 will see it on display in refurbished condition in a brand-new location.",
    "fullText": "Though the American battleship has long since been overshadowed as the U.S. Navy's most prolific and strategically important warship by the aircraft carrier, World War II-era battleships will forever be a crucial part of naval history. Fortunately for fans of American military and naval history, there are several U.S. battleships open to the public across the United States, where these classic vessels can be toured and appreciated.\n\nThe first of these museum battleships was the USS Texas (BB-35), which has been owned and operated by the State of Texas as a memorial since the late 1940s. With a history that predates other battleships like the Missouri and Iowa, the Texas is America's only surviving warship to have fought in both World Wars. And now, after years of uncertainty, the future of this historic vessel is looking bright, with work underway to move the ship to a new permanent home at the Port of Galveston.\n\nAnd when the new and improved USS Texas Museum opens, it won't just be displayed as an old and dilapidated relic. Instead, it will be a ship that will have undergone a thorough and costly $75 million restoration process to bring it back to its full, period-correct, World War II glory.\n\nMost of America's battleship museums are ships of the Iowa Class, which were commissioned during World War II and served into the 1990s. The Texas represents a much older era of battleships that played a pivotal role in both major theaters of World War II. Commissioned in 1914 as one of the U.S. Navy's two New York-class ships (which the Scientific American referred to as \"super dreadnoughts\"), the Texas quickly went into service supporting American interests during the Mexican Revolution. After the United States entered World War I, the Texas went to the North Sea, where it served as part of the historic Grand Fleet that oversaw the surrender of the Germans.\n\nThe Texas was modernized in the years between the wars, before again entering combat service in the Atlantic when World War II broke out. The USS Texas first supported the Allies during the North Africa campaign, then attacked German targets and supported the Allied Invasion force at Omaha Beach on D-Day in 1944. The ship would return to the U.S. for more modernizations before being sent to the Pacific Theater to fight the Japanese during the American invasions of Iwo Jima and Okinawa.\n\nFinally, the Texas ended its naval service by bringing American soldiers and sailors home during Operation Magic Carpet Ride in the months following the war. With newer battleships in the fleet and an increased focus on carriers, the aging ship was decommissioned and donated to the State of Texas in 1948.\n\nThe USS Texas was the first American battleship to become a permanent museum, located at the San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site. After decades on display and, with the ship's condition deteriorating, the Texas was moved to dry dock in 2022 to begin a series of repairs and renovations. Not only are these renovations addressing serious structural issues that would cause the ship to take on water, but the Texas is also receiving a full restoration with rebuilt structures, a new wooden deck, and fresh paint throughout to preserve the atmosphere of its combat days. So far, the process has required over 400,000 hours of labor, with over 700 tons of steel being replaced.\n\nWith the extensive four-plus-year restoration nearing completion at the start of 2026, the ship has secured its new home at Pier 15 in Galveston, where plans are underway for dredging, a permanent mooring, and brand new shoreside facilities to complete the museum. The Battleship Texas Foundation hopes to have the ship in place and the museum open to the public in late 2026 or early 2027. When the new and improved USS Texas Museum reopens, it will join the Aircraft Carrier USS Lexington Museum in Corpus Christi as one of the must-visit spots for military history on the Texas Gulf Coast.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "Ted Cruz trashed President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance in conversations with GOP donors last year, explosive leaked recordings allege.\n\nThe Texas senator, expected to run for president in 2028, slammed Trump’s tariff crusade and said he even threatened his staff with immediate firing if they used the phrase “Liberation Day” to refer to the day the sweeping taxes were announced, reports Axios.\n\nCruz, 55, told donors he and other senators expressed their tariff disgust with Trump in a lengthy phone call, warning it would tank the economy and lead to his impeachment. The call pushed past midnight and “did not go well,” Cruz told donors, with Trump “yelling” and “cursing” at the lawmakers.\n\nCruz claims that he received an especially explicit response from the president that night.\n\n“Mr. President, if we get to November of [2026] and people’s 401(k)s are down 30% and prices are up 10–20% at the supermarket, we’re going to go into Election Day, face a bloodbath,” Cruz told Trump, according to the recording. “You’re going to lose the House, you’re going to lose the Senate, you’re going to spend the next two years being impeached every single week.”\n\nTrump allegedly responded bluntly: “‘F--- you, Ted.’”\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nCruz’s office did not deny the contents of the recordings in a statement to Axios. Still, Cruz’s office claimed that he is still “the president’s greatest ally in the Senate and battles every day in the trenches to advance his agenda.”\n\nAxios reports that the recordings were “nearly 10 minutes in total” and came from conversations in “early and middle 2025.” The site said the recordings were provided by a “Republican source.”\n\nIt is unclear which donors Cruz was speaking to.\n\nTrump referred to Cruz as “Lyin’ Ted” in the 2016 GOP presidential primary and even went as far as suggesting that his wife, Heidi, is ugly compared to Melania. Still, Cruz has largely done Trump’s bidding in the Senate ever since, and he even campaigned for him in 2024.\n\nCruz, 55, is now believed to be eyeing another White House run, hoping to become a more traditional GOP successor to Trumpism. Standing in his way is the 41-year-old Vance, who is the overwhelming favorite to win the Republican nomination in the eyes of prediction markets.\n\nVance was “torched” by Cruz in the secret recordings, Axios reported. Sources also told The Washington Post last month that Cruz privately badmouths the VP to donors.\n\nIn the recordings obtained by Axios, Cruz claimed that Vance was a “pawn of conservative podcaster Tucker Carlson,” who is among Cruz’s biggest foes, having clashed with the ex-Fox News host in an explosive interview last summer over the Trump administration’s strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Cruz supported the intervention and has repeatedly criticized Carlson for his opposition to U.S. military support of Israel.\n\n“Tucker created JD,” Cruz told donors, according to Axios. “JD is Tucker’s protégé, and they are one and the same.”\n\nPublicly, Cruz has never explicitly linked Vance and Carlson. He alleged to donors that the ousted National Security Adviser Mike Waltz—of Signalgate infamy—was pushed out of Trump’s Cabinet by Carlson and Vance.\n\n“[He] supported being vigorous against Iran and bombing Iran—and Tucker and JD took Mike out,” Cruz said, according to Axios.\n\nCarlson told Axios he had nothing to do with the high-profile ouster.",

    "fullText": "A 2-year-old girl was taken into ICE custody with her father on Thursday in Minneapolis and flown to Texas before she was returned to her mother Friday afternoon, a family lawyer said.\n\nThe child’s transfer to Texas took place despite a court order requiring her immediate release, according to the affidavit filed by the family attorney. The toddler’s father, identified as Elvis Tipan-Echeverria, remains in custody, the family’s attorney Kira Kelley told CNN Friday evening.\n\nThe father and daughter were on the same flight returning to Minnesota on Friday afternoon, Kelley said. “The child is out of detention as of this afternoon, and recovering from this horrific ordeal,” Kelley said.\n\nThe toddler and her father were initially being held at a federal facility in Minneapolis on Thursday after agents pursued their vehicle in a “targeted enforcement operation,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told CNN Friday. Lawyers for the family identified that facility as the Whipple Federal Building. The building has served as the backdrop of tense standoffs between agents and protesters following the death of Minneapolis resident Renee Good earlier this month.\n\nThe father and the toddler, identified only as C.R.T.V. in court documents, are citizens of Ecuador, and the child has lived in Minneapolis “since her arrival in the United States as a newborn” and has a pending asylum application.\n\nThe incident comes as outrage continues to grow over federal agents taking 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos in the driveway of his home in Minneapolis this week during the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in the state. The boy was later put on a plane with his father to a family detention facility in Texas, where they remain.\n\nDuring the encounter with Tipan-Echeverria and his daughter, DHS said the father was “driving erratically with a child in the vehicle.” The father would then park the vehicle when federal agents attempted to take him into custody; however, “he refused multiple lawful commands to open his door or lower his window,” the agency said.\n\nThe toddler and her father had just returned home from the store and were inside their vehicle when ICE agents entered the backyard and driveway area of the home “without a warrant,” the affidavit says. One agent “broke the glass on the window” of Tipan-Echeverria’s vehicle while the toddler was also inside before the father and daughter exited the car, the affidavit says.\n\nCNN has reached out to DHS to inquire about the removal of the father and toddler to Texas, and the claim that agents had taken both without a warrant.\n\nVideo from the incident, which took place just after 1 p.m., shows people surrounding armed and masked federal agents and what appeared to be a federal vehicle. One man was heard yelling, “They were carrying a child in that!” seemingly referring to the federal vehicle.\n\nSome of the people at the scene started backing away as federal agents deployed what seemed to be a chemical agent. As the federal agents drove away, protesters continued to yell at them. “Help him!” one person yelled out.\n\nRoughly 120 people “surrounded the agents blocking them in and preventing exit” during the arrest, DHS said. “Agitators in the crowd then began to throw rocks and garbage cans toward the agents and child,” prompting agents to deploy crowd control measures to “safely clear the area,” the statement continued.\n\nDHS noted that obstructing and assaulting law enforcement is a felony and federal crime.\n\nFederal agents attempted to give the child to the mother, “who was in the area, but she refused,” DHS claimed. Federal agents “took care of the child who the mother would not take,” before the father and child were “reunited” at a federal facility, DHS said.\n\nHowever, the family’s lawyer said the child’s mother was standing outside and was near her husband as the couple were “calling out to each other” and the father tried to bring the child to her mother, but ICE agents “would not allow” it, the affidavit said.\n\nUpon seeing ICE agents approach her, the mother stepped back inside the house and was “terrified,” according to the affidavit. At that point, the father and his child were placed in the back of an ICE vehicle, which “did not have a car seat,” the affidavit said.\n\nThe allegations from DHS about the girl’s mother refusing to take custody of her child echo a similar statement from the agency in the case of Liam, saying the boy’s mother also refused to take custody of him. But Liam’s mother, according to Pastor Sergio Amezcua, who has been helping her with the case, was “terrified” of the agents outside her door.\n\nIn the case of Tipan-Echeverria and his daughter, attorneys for the family said: “Needless to say, she has no criminal history,” in an emergency petition to immediately release the toddler from federal custody to Kelley, who signed a notarized delegation of parental authority with the mother and custodial guardian.\n\nThe court granted the petition to immediately release the child, transferring custody of her temporarily to the attorney “for the purpose of retrieving the infant from immigration detention,” by 9:30 p.m. Thursday, the court documents said.\n\nThe court order determined “the risk of irreparable harm to maintain child in custody under the circumstances described in the pleadings are overwhelming.”\n\nThe father and his child were on a commercial airline flight to Texas by 8:30 p.m. that same day, despite the order issued at 8:11 p.m. that they should not be removed from Minnesota, their lawyer said in the affidavit, citing a conversation with a DHS counsel.\n\nThe agency then told the family’s attorney that it would fly the child back to Minnesota on Friday, the affidavit says. Kelley, the family lawyer, said she had not been able to contact her clients since they were taken into custody, according to the affidavit.\n\nA federal court order has barred ICE from sending the father outside of Minnesota while court proceedings play out, Kelley’s statement said.",

He will be back in Texas before the storm is projected to hit,” a spokesperson for the senator said in a statement, first shared with KHOU.\n\nMultiple critics invoked another moment from Cruz’s career where he went viral and earned plenty of mockery. In February 2021, Cruz was heavily criticized after took a trip to Cancun, Mexico, while Texas was hit with the deadly Winter Storm Uri.\n\nThe senator returned to Texas at the time and admitted his trip was “obviously a mistake.”\n\n“It was obviously a mistake, and in hindsight, I wouldn’t have done it,” he said.\n\nThe latest storm is expected to stretch across 2,000 miles eventually, while it’ll begin in Texas and Oklahoma. Heavy snowfall and freezing rain are expected to begin Friday, hitting northern Texas and cities like Dallas and Houston. The storm will eventually move its way to the East Coast.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott (R) has declared a state of emergency in his state over the approaching harsh weather.\n\n“Based on current forecasts, the State of Texas is acting to ensure Texans have the resources they need before severe winter weather impacts communities across Texas,” the governor announced this week. “I thank emergency management personnel and first responders for working tirelessly to keep Texans safe.”\n\nThe post Ted Cruz Bites Back at Critics Furious Over His Leaving Texas Ahead of Major Winter Storm first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "A Cuban migrant held in solitary confinement at an immigration detention facility in Texas died after guards held him down and he stopped breathing, according to an autopsy report released Wednesday that ruled the death a homicide.  Geraldo Lunas Campos died Jan. 3 following an altercation with guards.  U.S.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A Cuban migrant held in solitary confinement at an immigration detention facility in Texas died after guards held him down and he stopped breathing, according to an autopsy report released Wednesday that ruled the death a homicide.\n\nGeraldo Lunas Campos died Jan. 3 following an altercation with guards. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said the 55-year-old father of four was attempting suicide and the staff tried to save him.\n\nBut a witness told The Associated Press last week that Lunas Campos was handcuffed as at least five guards held him down and one put an arm around his neck and squeezed until he was unconscious.\n\nHis death was one of at least three reported in little more than a month at Camp East Montana, a sprawling tent facility in the desert on the grounds of Fort Bliss, an Army base.\n\nThe autopsy report by the El Paso County Medical Examiner’s Office found Lunas Campos' body showed signs of a struggle, including abrasions on his chest and knees. He also had hemorrhages on his neck. The deputy medical examiner, Dr. Adam Gonzalez. determined the cause of death was asphyxia due to neck and torso compression.\n\nThe report said witnesses saw Lunas Campos “become unresponsive while being physically restrained by law enforcement.” It did not elaborate on what happened during the struggle but cited evidence of injuries to his neck, head and torso associated with physical restraint. The report also noted the presence of petechial hemorrhages — tiny blood spots from burst capillaries that can be associated with intense strain or injury — in the eyelids and skin of the neck.\n\nDr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist who reviewed the autopsy report for AP, said the presence of petechiae in the eyes support the conclusion that asphyxia caused the death. Those injuries suggest pressure on the body and are often associated with such deaths, he said.\n\nHe said the contusions on Lunas Campos’ body may reflect physical restraint and the neck injuries were consistent with a hand or knee on the neck.\n\nThe autopsy also found the presence of prescription antidepressant and antihistamine medications, adding that Lunas Campos had a history of bipolar disorder and anxiety. It made no mention of him attempting suicide.\n\nGovernment provided changing accounts of what happened\n\nICE's initial account of the death, which included no mention of an altercation with guards, said Lunas Campos had become disruptive and staff moved him into a cellblock where detainees are held away from others.\n\n“While in segregation, staff observed him in distress and contacted on-site medical personnel for assistance,” the agency said in its Jan. 9 statement. “Medical staff responded, initiated lifesaving measures, and requested emergency medical services.”\n\nLunas Campos was pronounced dead after paramedics arrived.\n\nLast Thursday, after Lunas Campos' family was first informed the death was likely to be ruled a homicide, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin amended the government's account, saying he had attempted suicide and guards tried to help him.\n\n“Campos violently resisted the security staff and continued to attempt to take his life,” she said. “During the ensuing struggle, Campos stopped breathing and lost consciousness.”\n\nAfter the final autopsy report was released Wednesday, McLaughlin issued a statement emphasizing that Lunas Campos was “a criminal illegal alien and convicted child sex predator.”\n\nNew York court records show Lunas Campos was convicted in 2003 of sexual contact with a person under 11, a felony for which he was sentenced to one year in jail and placed on the state’s sex offender registry. Lunas Campos was also sentenced to five years in prison and three years of supervision in 2009 after being convicted of attempting to sell a controlled substance, according to the New York corrections records. He completed the sentence in January 2017.\n\n“ICE takes seriously the health and safety of all those detained in our custody,\" McLaughlin said Wednesday, adding that the agency was investigating the death. DHS has not responded to questions about whether any outside law enforcement agency was also investigating.\n\nDeaths put a spotlight on Camp East Montana\n\nThe AP reported in August that the $1.2 billion contract to build and operate Camp East Montana, expected to become the largest detention facility in the U.S., was awarded to a private contractor headquartered in a single-family home in Richmond, Virginia. The company, Acquisition Logistics LLC, had no prior experience running a corrections facility and has subcontracted with other companies to help operate the camp.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the guards present when Lunas Campos died were government employees or those of a private contractor.\n\nA final determination of homicide by the medical examiner would typically be critical in determining whether any guards are held criminally or civilly liable. The fact that Lunas Campos died on an Army base could limit state and local officials’ legal jurisdiction to investigate.\n\nLunas Campos was among the first detainees sent to Camp Montana East, arriving in September after ICE arrested him in Rochester, New York, where he lived for more than two decades. He was legally admitted to the U.S. in 1996, part of a wave of Cuban immigrants seeking to reach Florida by boat.\n\nICE said he was picked up in July as part of a planned immigration enforcement operation due to criminal convictions that made him eligible for removal.\n\nIn addition to Lunas Campos, ICE announced that on Dec. 3 an immigrant from Guatemala held in Camp East Montana died after being transferred to a El Paso hospital for care. While the cause of death was still pending, the agency said Francisco Gaspar-Andres, 48, was suspected to have died of liver and kidney failure.\n\nOn Sunday, ICE announced that Victor Manuel Diaz, a 36-year-old immigrant from Nicaragua, died at Camp East Montana on Jan. 14 of a “presumed suicide.” The agency said Diaz was detained by ICE earlier this month during the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.\n\nUnlike with the two prior deaths, Diaz's body wasn't sent to the county medical examiner in El Paso. McLaughlin said Wednesday that the autopsy for Diaz is being performed at the Army medical center at Fort Bliss. DHS again did not respond to questions about whether any agency other than ICE will investigate the death.\n\nRep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes El Paso, called on DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and acting ICE Director Todd M. Lyons to brief Congress about the recent deaths.\n\n“DHS must preserve all evidence — including halting their effort to deport the witnesses,” Escobar said Wednesday. “I reiterate my call for Camp East Montana to be shut down and for the contract with the corporation running it to be terminated.”",

The officers then told him to knock on the door to his home to see if other people were inside, “essentially using a 5-year-old as bait,\" she said.\n\nStenvik said the family has an active asylum case and has not been ordered to leave the country.\n\n“Why detain a 5-year-old?” she asked. \"You cannot tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal.”\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that “ICE did NOT target a child.”\n\nShe said Immigration and Customs Enforcement was conducting an operation to arrest the child’s father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, who McLaughlin said is from Ecuador and in the U.S. illegally. He fled on foot, “abandoning his child,” she said.\n\n“For the child’s safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended Conejo Arias,” McLaughlin said, adding that parents are given the choice to be removed with their children or have them placed with a person of their choosing.\n\nStenvik said another adult who lives at the home was outside when the father and son were taken, but agents wouldn't leave Liam with that person. DHS didn't immediately respond to an email Thursday asking if Conejo Arias had asked to keep his son with him.\n\nLiam and his father were being held in a family holding cell in Texas, Marc Prokosch, the family’s lawyer, said during the news conference.\n\n“Every step of their immigration process has been doing what they’ve been asked to do,” Prokosch said of the family's asylum claim. “So this is just cruelty.”\n\nMinnesota has become a major focus of immigration sweeps by DHS-led agencies. Greg Bovino, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection official who has been the face of the crackdowns in Minneapolis and other cities, said 3,000 “of some of the most dangerous offenders” have been arrested in Minnesota in the last six weeks.\n\nJulia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said advocates have no way of knowing whether the government’s arrest numbers and descriptions of the people in custody are accurate.\n\nLiam is the fourth student from Columbia Heights Public Schools who has been detained by ICE in recent weeks, said Stenvik. A 17-year-old student was taken Tuesday while heading to school, and a 10-year-old and a 17-year-old have also been taken, she said.\n\nThe district is made up of five schools and about 3,400 students from pre-K to 12th grade, according to its website. The majority of the students come from immigrant families, according to Stenvik.\n\nShe said they've noticed their attendance drop over the past two weeks, including one day where they had about one-third of their students out from school.\n\nElla Sullivan, Liam’s teacher, described him as “kind and loving.”\n\n“His classmates miss him,” she said. \"And all I want is for him to be safe and back here.”\n\nThis story was updated to correct Greg Bovino's title to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection offical, not Patrol.",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M baseball head coach Michael Earley's roster continues to garner national preseason accolades entering his second year at the helm in College Station.\n\nAccording to Perfect Game USA's Top Players by Class list, six Aggies were recognized as some of the best players in college baseball in their respective classes. It includes juniors Caden Sorrell, Chris Hacopian, Gavin Grahovac, and Shane Sdao, sophomore Terrence Kiel II, and freshman Nico Partida. After losing many top contributors to the MLB Draft in the spring of 2025, Earley reloaded well in the transfer portal and maintained decent roster retention.\n\nTexas A&M will look to put last year's woes behind it and turn the page to a new chapter in 2026.

While Texas A&M's roster suffered many injuries to open last year's efforts, the team's underwhelming performances led to the Aggies becoming the first preseason No. 1 to miss the postseason since 1991. As a result, some national journalists, such as Baseball America's Jacob Rudner, have avoided ranking the program in the top 25.\n\n\"So, what’s the holdup? The decision to hold Texas A&M out is rooted entirely in last season’s outcome. A year ago, a similarly talented roster opened the season ranked No. 1 and missed the NCAA Tournament altogether. Michael Earley retooled his staff this offseason and early returns have been positive, but until the Aggies translate that talent into consistent results, the benefit of the doubt is withheld. The expectation is not whether Texas A&M belongs in the rankings, but whether or not it will prove it does,\" Rudner said.\n\nTexas A&M's first pitch of 2026 is scheduled for Friday, Feb. 13, against the Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles in College Station. Game 1 is set for 6 p.m., with Games 2 and 3 scheduled for 2 p.m. CT on Saturday, February 14, and 12 p.m. CT on Sunday, February 15, respectively.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Dylan on X: @dylanmflippo.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M baseball's 2026 roster racking up preseason accolades",

    "description": "Cougar Nation should be mighty proud of what its women’s basketball squad accomplished Wednesday night.",
    "fullText": "Thanks to recent football and men’s basketball matchups which all resulted in losses, BYU fans have learned to really loathe Texas Tech.\n\nThus, Cougar Nation should be mighty proud of what its women’s basketball squad accomplished Wednesday night.\n\nBYU scored a 73-61 upset victory over the No. 19-ranked Lady Raiders at the Marriott Center, toppling the Big 12’s top team for Lee Cummard’s first ranked win at the helm of the Cougars’ program.\n\n“I’m just really proud of the group and glad to see their hard work paying off and be rewarded for how close of a group it is, and how hard they work and prepare for these games,” Cummard told reporters after the win. “(We) had a great couple days of practice, great shoot around this morning. I just want (the players) to know that, you know, they’re a really good team and they’re rewarded for that tonight.”\n\nBYU trailed for less than a minute to open the night before quickly pulling ahead and never looking back, leading by as many as 17 points against a Texas Tech team that had yet to lose on the road and was 19-1 prior to arriving in Provo.\n\n“I felt like at least tonight, regardless of who they have, our five were more connected and tighter as a group, and we were the better five on the court,” Cummard said.\n\nThe Cougars shot a collective 47.3% from the field and 44.4% from 3-point range — a far cry from their previous season average of 29.7% — while feasting down low for 36 paint points.\n\nshots are fallin' ☔️\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/HaKZkEFic9\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\nBest exemplifying BYU’s fight was center Lara Rohkohl, who finished with 15 points, eight rebounds and a game-high plus/minus of +15, refusing to let the ultra-physical Lady Raiders push her around in the post.\n\n“They were a little aggressive down there, but you know, we stood against it and we did a good job down there,” Rohkohl said. “The guards were giving me perfect passes into my hands, and I just had to go up and finish it.”\n\nFeeding Rohkohl often was star sophomore point guard Delaney Gibb, who fought through double teams for 18 points, five rebounds and six assists while swiping four steals on the defensive end of the floor.\n\nAutomatic🔥\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/E5ruG3c7mP\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\n“I know that if I’m getting hounded and double-teamed, I can kick to shooters and pass to Lara and they’re gonna make plays out of it,” Gibb said. “And so I think we played super connected tonight and just moved the ball really well, which opened up great looks for us.”\n\nSome of that ball movement came from Rohkohl, who cashed in two assists by kicking outside to Gibb for a pair of 3-pointers.\n\nBullseye Delaney🎯\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/Dn4lsb6UJ6\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\n“Being in the paint and kicking out to a 3, in my opinion, is the best shot that there is,” Gibb said. “It’s really easy to make, all your momentum is going to the hoop. (Rohkohl) was fighting hard in the paint, and so for her to unselfishly spray out to shooters on the outside is never going to go unnoticed.”\n\nBYU’s leading scorer was freshman guard Olivia Hamlin, who put up the best performance of her young career — especially considering the competition — by posting 20 points of 9 of 15 shooting with four rebounds and two steals.\n\nEleven of Hamlin’s 20 points came in the first quarter to set the tone for the remainder of the contest, and she ended the night with six fourth quarter points to help bury Texas Tech for good.\n\n🤯🤯🤯\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/XSatpyvczA\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\n“She was on it from the jump,” Cummard said of Hamlin. “... Tonight it was hard to keep her off the court. She was hugely impactful on the defensive end with those steals early, but even late, just with constant pressure.\n\n“People have a really hard time going around her, and people have a really hard time keeping her in front. (She is a) huge, huge asset to the group every game, but tonight she just brought it, you know, played with force and made plays for the group.”\n\nDefensively, BYU was outstanding, holding the Lady Raiders to 33.3% shooting and scoring 24 points off of 21 forced turnovers. The Cougars clamped down hardest in the fourth quarter, allowing just three makes on 16 field goal attempts.\n\nROBBED 'EM🤯\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/Jl3Aw4Ioyr\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\n“It was the most connected we’ve been all year defensively,” Cummard said. “We’ve been a pretty good defensive team, you know, visually, but also metrically speaking.\n\n“... I just thought that we minimized some of the lapses that we’ve had in some of our losses. ... It shows growth in what we’re doing, but just overall, the connectivity on that (defensive) end was really, really good as a group.”\n\nWith the win, BYU is now 15-4 on the campaign and has already matched last year’s mark of four victories in Big 12 play — a number Cummard’s Cougars will certainly increase given their 11 remaining conference contests, along with the newfound confidence from toppling a team such as Texas Tech.\n\n“I feel like we’ve had a pretty tough schedule thus far, and so it’s kind of like a breath of air (to win),” Gibb said. “I feel like this game is going to bring so much confidence to our team. We have a ton of young players, some of which this is their first year of college basketball, and so I think this kind of just reminds us that we can compete at the highest level. I think going into our next conference games, we’re going to be hungry to do the same thing every single night.”\n\nWIN CAM👐 pic.twitter.com/0H7qG1QNUo\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026",

    "fullText": "ATLANTA (AP) — With many Americans still recovering from multiple blasts of snow and unrelenting freezing temperatures in the nation’s northern tier, a new storm is set to emerge this weekend that could coat roads, trees and power lines with devastating ice across a wide expanse of the South.\n\nThe storm arriving late this week and into the weekend is shaping up to be a “widespread potentially catastrophic event from Texas to the Carolinas,” said Ryan Maue, a former chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\n“I don’t know how people are going to deal with it,” he said.\n\nForecasters on Tuesday warned that the ice could weigh down trees and power lines, triggering widespread outages.\n\n“If you get a half of an inch of ice — or heaven forbid an inch of ice — that could be catastrophic,” said Keith Avery, CEO of the Newberry Electric Cooperative in South Carolina.\n\n‘Great swaths’ of heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain expected\n\nThe National Weather Service warned of \"great swaths of heavy snow, sleet, and treacherous freezing rain” starting Friday in much of the nation’s midsection and then shifting toward the East Coast through Sunday.\n\nTemperatures will be slow to warm in many areas, meaning ice that forms on roads and sidewalks might stick around, forecasters say.\n\nThe exact timing of the approaching storm — and where it is headed — remained uncertain on Tuesday. Forecasters say it can be challenging to predict precisely which areas could see rain and which ones could be punished with ice.\n\nCold air clashing with rain to fuel a 'major winter storm’\n\nAn extremely cold arctic air mass is set to dive south from Canada, setting up a clash with the cold temperatures and rain that will be streaming eastward across the southern U.S.\n\n“This is extreme, even for this being the peak of winter,” National Weather Service meteorologist Bryan Jackson said of the cold temperatures.\n\nWhen the cold air meets the rain, the likely result will be “a major winter storm with very impactful weather, with all the moisture coming up from the Gulf and encountering all this particularly cold air that’s spilling in,” Jackson said.\n\nAn atmospheric river could set up across the southern U.S.\n\nAn atmospheric river of moisture could be in place by the weekend, pulling precipitation across Texas and other states along the Gulf Coast and continuing across Georgia and the Carolinas, forecasters said.\n\n“Global models are painting a concerning picture of what this weekend could look like, with an increasingly strong signal for ice storm potential across North Georgia and portions of central Georgia,” according to the National Weather Service's Atlanta office.\n\nIf significant accumulations of ice strike metro Atlanta, it could be a problem through the weekend since low temperatures early Monday are expected to be around 22 degrees (minus 5.6 Celsius) in Atlanta. The city's high temperature on Monday is forecast to be around 35 degrees (1.7 Celsius).\n\nHighway and air travel could be tangled by the storm\n\nTravel is a major concern, as southern states have less equipment to remove snow and ice from roads, and extremely cold temperatures expected after the storm could prevent ice from melting for several days. In Michigan, more than 100 vehicles crashed into each other or slid off an interstate southwest of Grand Rapids on Monday.\n\nThe storm is also expected to impact many of the nation’s major hub airports, including those in Dallas; Atlanta; Memphis, Tennessee; and Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nPolar air from Canada to keep northern states in a deep freeze\n\nUnusually cold temperatures are already in place across much of the northern tier of the U.S., but the blast of arctic air expected later this week “will be the coldest yet,” Jackson said.\n\n“There’s a large sprawling vortex of low pressure centered over Hudson Bay,” Jackson said of the sea in northern Canada that’s connected to the Arctic Ocean. “And this is dominating the weather over all of North America.”\n\nTexas could be a harbinger for other parts of the South\n\nSome of the storm’s earliest impacts could be in Texas on Friday, as the arctic air mass slides south through much of the state, National Weather Service forecaster Sam Shamburger said in a briefing on the storm.\n\n“At the same time, we’re expecting rain to move into much of the state,” Shamburger said.\n\nLow temperatures could fall into the 20s or even the teens in parts of Texas by Saturday, with the potential for a wintery mix of weather in the northern part of the state.\n\nForecasters cautioned that significant uncertainty remains, particularly over how much ice or snow could fall across north and central Texas.\n\n“It’s going to be a very difficult forecast,” Shamburger said.\n\nAt an Arkansas hardware store, customers gear up for storm\n\nIn Little Rock, Arkansas, a steady stream of customers on Tuesday were stocking up on supplies at Fuller and Son Hardware.\n\n“Right now parents of young children are getting sleds,” said James Carter, the company’s director of operations.\n\nPeople were also getting shovels, ice-melting products and covers for outside faucets to keep them from freezing, since low temperatures in the Little Rock area are forecast to fall into the teens, he said.\n\nPanjwani reported from Washington.

    "description": "When will Jayden Quaintance return?",
    "fullText": "The Kentucky Wildcats have won three straight games in SEC play and are now 3-2 in league play. Last week, they earned hard-fought road wins at LSU and Tennessee. Kentucky is now 29th in the AP Poll, having received the fourth-most votes of teams just outside the Top 25.\n\nUnfortunately, the Wildcats will have to continue winning without big man Jayden Quaintance. Head coach Mark Pope announced on Tuesday that Quaintance will miss Wednesday’s matchup with the Texas Longhorns.\n\n“He will not play tomorrow night, but he’s making progress,” Pope said at his Tuesday press conference. “We’re super optimistic (about Quaintance playing again this season), and he’s kind of going through the process, and hopefully he’ll be back soon. I know that’s not very descriptive, but I’m trying to be protective of him also.”\n\nIt’s great that there is optimism that Quaintance can return this season. He does add something to this team, and that can matter in February and March.\n\nQuaintance is a really good rebounder and shot blocker. His presence makes Kentucky’s defense better. However, he’s not much of an offensive threat just yet. He can become one, and his defensive prowess is really intriguing.\n\nKentucky put up a valiant effort against Tennessee on the board Saturday with Quaintance out. That shows this team can win even as Quaintance deals with swelling in his knee, which has kept him out since the Missouri game.\n\nThe Wildcats host Texas on Wednesday, a team that averages over 86 points per game. Kentucky weathered the storm without Quaintance on Saturday against a big Tennessee team. They’ll have to do so again on Wednesday against the Longhorns, and likely Saturday as well when they host Ole Miss.",

    "fullText": "Records are meant to be broken, and the Texas A&M Aggies wasted no time proving it at the Corky Classic in Lubbock. Several members of the Aggie Track & Field program made history over the weekend, setting the tone for what could be a special indoor campaign.\n\nTexas A&M opened the season with force, stacking up 39 top‑ten finishes, 19 medalists, and multiple athletes climbing the program’s all‑time performer lists.\n\nThe first breakthrough came from senior thrower Henry Zimmerman, who delivered a school‑record performance in the weight throw. His final attempt—21.88m (71‑9.5)—secured second overall and made him the top collegiate finisher in the field.\n\nFreshman pole vaulter Lily Carlson followed with a statement of her own. Competing in just her second collegiate meet, Carlson cleared 4.41m (14‑5.5) to break the Texas A&M indoor record previously held by All‑American Heather Abadie. She claimed gold with a dominant seven‑inch margin over the next closest competitor.\n\nThe record‑setting weekend wrapped on the final day when freshman distance runner Peter Narumbe delivered one of the fastest 1,000m races in NCAA history. His time of 2:19.88 not only broke Luca Santorum’s school record—it also stands as the 17th‑fastest 1,000m ever recorded at the collegiate level. His gold‑medal finish ranks him third all‑time among NCAA freshmen.\n\nWhile Texas A&M is traditionally known for its outdoor prowess, this year’s squad has the depth and talent to be a real factor indoors and in the SEC race. The Aggies return to action on January 25, hosting the Ted Nelson Invitational at the Fasken Indoor Track & Field facility.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes, and opinions.

    "fullText": "SAN ANGELO, Texas (Concho Valley Homepage) — The Rams and Rambelles stay home for a midweek matchup versus Texas A&M-Kingsville.\n\nThe Angelo State Rams and Rambelles are set to host Lone Star Conference rival Texas A&M-Kingsville in back-to-back games. Before the matchups tip off on Wednesday night, both teams have lots to build on following last week’s performances.\n\nHead coach Alesha Ellis and the Rambelles split their home series last week, losing to UT Permian Basin and defeating UT Dallas. The biggest difference in the second game revolves around ball distribution. Four different Rambelles reached double figures in the same game, led by Taylor Grona and Majik Esquivel with 16 and 14 points, respectively. The key going forward is continued ball distribution along with primary leadership, especially among the two young athletes.\n\n“[Grona and Esquivel] are some of the best competitors that I’ve ever coached,” Ellis said. “Taylor has done such a great job and so has Majik. They’re only sophomores this year, so they’re pretty young. They come to practice every day willing to get better, and they’re the ones asking how to get better.”\n\nOn the Rams’ side, the injury bug continues. Limited player availability is a disadvantage anytime, but the Rams refuse to go down without a fight. Angelo State comes off a win over UT Permian Basin and loss to UT Dallas. The biggest difference in those games was UT Dallas’ zone defense displayed in the second half, something head coach Vinay Patel’s squad wasn’t previously accustomed to.\n\n“We just have not seen a ton of zone this year, [so it was] probably smart on [UT Dallas’] part to zone us,” Patel said. “Some of our top three-point shooters have been out with injury, but it’s the first time that we’ve seen a predominant zone for an entire half. I thought it became contagious when we started missing shots. We spent the weekend working on our zone attack, making sure we’re ready if we see it again and try to figure some different things out.”",

    "fullText": "EL PASO, Texas (AP) — An immigrant from Nicaragua was found dead at a Texas immigration detention facility last week, federal officials said.\n\nVictor Manuel Diaz appears to have killed himself Wednesday at the sprawling tent complex at the U.S. Army's Fort Bill base in El Paso, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement. The federal investigation into his death continues.\n\nIt's the same facility where ICE said another detainee died earlier this month as staff members tried to keep him from killing himself. But a fellow detainee said at least five officers were restraining the handcuffed inmate and at least one had an arm around his neck.\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE — This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988.\n\nDiaz was swept up on Jan. 6 in the federal crackdown on immigration in Minnesota and sent to Texas, ICE said.\n\nDiaz entered the United States in March 2024 and Border Patrol officers took him into custody, He was released on parole pending a court date and a judge ordered him to leave the U.S. in an August hearing that Diaz did not attend, ICE said.\n\nDiaz was given a final order for removal on Jan. 12, two days before he was found unconscious in his room, authorities said.\n\nICE did not release any other details on Diaz's death. The agency notifies Congress and releases a statement on its website of all in-custody deaths.\n\nDiaz, 36, was being held at Camp Montana East where ICE said another detainee, Geraldo Lunas Campos, died as staff members tried to prevent him from killing himself.\n\nBut a preliminary investigation by the El Paso County Medical Examiner’s Office found Lunas Campos, 55, died from asphyxia from chest and neck compression and said the death would likely be classified a homicide.\n\nA fellow detainee told the AP that Lunas Campos was handcuffed and refused to go back into his cell when at least five guards pinned him to the floor. The detainee said at least one of the guards squeezed an arm around Lunas Campos' neck.\n\nICE said it is still investigating that death.",

    "title": "Led by Texas, New Hampshire, states race to prove can –\"Bitcoin on bal sheet\"",
    "description": "Many U.S. states are planning bitcoin strategic reserves, and other forms of crypto financing, showing budgets are buying into the digital assets trend.",
    "fullText": "Led by Texas and New Hampshire, U.S. states across the national map, both red and blue in political stripes, are developing bitcoin strategic reserves and bringing cryptocurrencies onto their books through additional state finance and budgeting measures.\n\nTexas recently became the first state to purchase bitcoin after a legislative effort that began in 2024, but numerous states have joined the \"Reserve Race\" to pass legislation that will allow them to ultimately buy cryptocurrencies.\n\nNew Hampshire passed its crypto strategic reserve law last May, even before Texas, giving the state treasurer the authority to invest up to 5% of the state funds in crypto ETFs, though precious metals such as gold are also authorized for purchase. Arizona passed similar legislation, while Massachusetts, Ohio, and South Dakota have legislation at various stages of committee review.\n\nDespite much of the legislation being largely sponsored or co-sponsored by Republicans, the adoption of crypto at the state level is not expected to strictly fall along party lines. The 2024 election cycle was the first time that the cryptocurrency industry played a major role in lobbying in both state and national elections. In fact, it was the largest corporate donor in an election cycle, with support given to candidates on both sides. It is already amassing a war chest for the 2026 midterms.\n\nCongress is currently debating a crypto market structure bill, and state-level politicians are as much out to prove that they, and their states, won't be left out of the digital assets boom. Justin Marlowe, a public policy professor at the University of Chicago, sees the state-level trend as largely one of signaling at present. \"If you're a governor and you want to broadcast that you are amenable to innovative business development in the digital economy, these are relatively low-cost, low-risk ways to send that signal. That's why we've seen leaders across the ideological spectrum and all over the country take tangible steps in this direction,\" he said.\n\nWhere the state-level crypto efforts can be described as \"bigger steps\" — Marlowe cited Texas, Arizona, and Florida, as examples — he said it has helped to acknowledge the growing political power of crypto advocates in these states.\n\nSimilarities in the actions taken across states to date include include authorizing the state treasurer or other investment official to allow the investment of a limited amount of public funds in crypto and building out the governance structure needed to invest in crypto. This often will involve more frequent reporting requirements and stronger custodial agreements compared to traditional asset classes. The seeding of the reserve can take the form of utilizing cash or government-seized crypto, as in the recent case of the federal government. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a strategic bitcoin reserve last March, but limited the authorization to seized crypto in an effort to show taxpayers would bear no financial burden.\n\nIt is no surprise that Texas was the first state to fund a crypto reserve. Texas has been a crypto hub for years through its role in bitcoin mining. The state's affordable and flexible power, as well as a political environment that has largely been pro-crypto, led Texas in recent years to a sizable position in not just the national, but global bitcoin hashing market.\n\n\"Texas has spent the last few years becoming one of the key centers of bitcoin activity, especially on the mining side,\" said Christian Catalini, founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab, seeing this move as one that early branded the state as \"open for business\" when it comes to digital assets.\n\n\"Once you've made that bet on infrastructure and industry, adding some Bitcoin exposure at the treasury level is a natural next step,\" Catalini said. Such a move essentially makes the state's balance sheet one that is explicitly aligned with the ecosystem it aims to attract.\n\nTexas also has a long history with bitcoin's traditional market competitor: gold.\n\n\"Texas has proven to be a bedrock of government adoption of bitcoin, starting with laws that allow for legal custody arrangements akin to gold storage laws that are well established there,\" said Nik Bhatia, founder of The Bitcoin Layer.\n\nWhen it comes to storing physical gold, Texas has clear rules on storage and ownership, and even the language invoked – vaults, custodians – helps grease the wheels for crypto assets at the state level. The Texas Bullion Depository of 2015, which allowed for state-level depository of bullion and precious metals, was specifically adapted to apply to digital assets like bitcoin. The Texas Bullion Depositary was the first state-administered precious metals depository in the nation.\n\nTexas has not purchased any on-chain bitcoin. After passing the legislation to create a strategic bitcoin reserve that gave authorization to the state comptroller to hold the cryptocurrency, Texas purchased a stake in a bitcoin ETF — roughly $5 million in the largest bitcoin ETF, the BlackRock iShares' Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which since its launch in January 2024 has grown to over $72 billion in assets under management.\n\nThe Comptroller's office made its purchase on the morning of November 20, 2025, when the price of a single bitcoin was $91,336. As of Saturday morning, bitcoin was trading at a little over $95,000.\n\nBhatia said the approval of bitcoin ETFs by the SEC was crucial to the state plans to be comfortable with the holdings under current U.S. securities law. \"Using ETFs is a very clean and safe way to invest in bitcoin, minimizing storage logistical risk and opting for security law protection,\" Bhatia said.\n\nTexas state officials have described this purchase — which deployed only half of the $10 million set aside by the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve — as a \"placeholder\" while security and storage for raw bitcoin can be put into place.\n\nIn addition to the concept of reserve funds, states are bringing crypto into core finance functions, with an approach that balances the inherent trepidation of venturing into new terrain with a desire to be a part of the fast-moving crypto realm.\n\nNew Hampshire, for example, became the first state to approve the issuance of a bitcoin-backed municipal bond last November, a $100 million issuance that would mark the first time cryptocurrency is used as collateral in the U.S. municipal bond market. The deal has not taken place yet, though plans are for the issuance to occur this year. \"The idea is they'll use bitcoin to back a municipal bond issue, the proceeds of which will then be divvied up into loans to smaller governments for economic development projects across the state,\" Marlowe said. Repayment of these loans will recapitalize the fund.\n\nIt is a creative evolution in state finances, but like many of the mechanisms for crypto development at the state level, it utilizes existing financial structures and state goals, according to Marlowe, with similar public bonds in prior decades used for projects like clean water, school upgrades, and other infrastructure. \"What's different here is it's bitcoin rather than taxpayer dollars as the collateral,\" he said.\n\nIn numerous states, including, Colorada, Utah, and Louisiana, crypto is now accepted as payment for taxes and other state business. As more state public finance crypto efforts develop, the shift represents a change in a core philosophy of safety and liquidity that has dominated the investing of state and local funds for centuries.\n\nIn recent decades, assets including real estate and private equity expanded the investment approach of public funds, but crypto represents not only the most recent addition, but the most volatile.\n\n\"For many in the state/local investing industry, crypto-backed assets are still far too speculative and volatile for public money,\" Marlowe said. \"But others, and I think there's a sort of generational shift in the works, see it as a reasonable store of value that is actually stronger on many other public sector values like transparency and asset integrity,\" he added.",

    "description": "We moved from Texas to Denver and downsized our home, gaining more time together, walkability, community, and freedom for our kids.",
    "fullText": "In July 2025, my husband, Zach, and I moved our family of four from the suburbs of Ft Worth, Texas, to Denver.\n\nAfter nearly 10 years of marriage, two kids, and three work-related moves, it was finally time to settle in a place of our choosing. This time, we didn't just want a change of scenery; we wanted a change of lifestyle.\n\nBut finding a house in the bustling city neighborhood of our dreams within our budget meant downsizing — drastically.\n\nMoving from our 3,300-square-foot home to a 2,300-square-foot bungalow with 1,200 square feet of actual living space (the rest being unfinished basement) wasn't easy. It meant swapping our large kitchen island for a small dining table. It meant no more master bath soaking tub, my refuge from life's stresses on more occasions than I could count. And it meant my kids giving up their separate rooms to share one.\n\nBut what we've gained in the quality and quantity of time spent together is worth every bit of lost square footage.\n\nOur bigger house in Texas required more upkeep, and we were more than happy to give that up for extra free time on the weekends. Now, we spend our time visiting attractions such as the Denver Zoo and the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. We're fostering our kids' curiosity, exploring new places together. Our everyday life feels more special and meaningful because these shared experiences amplify our family connection.\n\nWe're also getting out in nature more. Aside from weekend hiking and skiing adventures, our days revolve around outdoor living. We walk everywhere we can, including restaurants, parks, and even Trader Joe's, which is beneficial because driving to Trader Joe's means parking at Trader Joe's, and nobody enjoys that. Our moods are lighter, and our stresses are reduced.\n\nThe first time we walked to a restaurant instead of driving, it felt like we were on vacation. Our lives had always been car-dependent, but that's no longer the case. The kids laughed and raced each other down the sidewalk. We marvelled at the mature trees and brightly colored flowers lining 7th Avenue Parkway. There was no timeline or rushing, just the joy of being present. When we made our way home after an alfresco dinner at Postino, I asked my son if he liked walking to dinner. He asked simply, \"Can we do this every day?\"\n\nZach and I frequently sit on our front porch while our boys play with neighborhood kids, a first for us. Having houses so close together makes it easier to meet people and form real connections. We know almost every household on our block, and we regularly visit with our closest neighbors. We even enjoyed our first block party in August, which fell on my eldest's birthday, and according to him, it was his \"Best birthday ever!\"\n\nOur boys run between yards while we chat with new friends. They are experiencing a childhood closer to the one we grew up with. They're building confidence and finding their place, and that's translating to more smiles and fewer tantrums. Zach and I are finding our village, and parenthood feels less solitary.\n\nOn a recent trip back to Texas for Thanksgiving, I texted our next-door neighbor to let her know we'd be out of town. Without even asking, she offered to take in our mail. It may be a small gesture, but that sense of community is priceless to us.\n\nDownsizing has also allowed our kids to play more independently in an outdoor space that feels safe and protected. We have an unobstructed line of sight to the backyard, and no matter where my husband and I are in the house, we can hear them if they need us. The result has been hours of creative play, building campsites and outdoor kitchens, playing soccer and baseball, and having water balloon fights or Nerf battles.\n\nMost evenings, my kids are in the backyard playing games and getting dirty. When the weather is nice, they run around with their friends down the street. I would never have felt comfortable not knowing every move my kids were making before, but here, where everyone is watching out, and I can wave at my kids down the block to signal when it's time to come home, less space means more freedom.\n\nOur downsized life isn't always perfect. Despite all our decluttering efforts, we're still left with more stuff than we can accommodate. We also struggle with the lack of privacy, and at times, our smaller shared space feels more claustrophobic than cozy. However, downsizing for an urban lifestyle has given us the opportunity to live beyond our four walls, and that's worth more than any amount of space could ever be.",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M's 2026 quarterback room will be a talking point heading into the early parts of the offseason, as head coach Mike Elko and new QB coach Joey Lynch have yet to land a veteran signal caller from the transfer portal after incoming redshirt junior QB Marcel Reed announced his return for the 2026 campaign, while 2025 backup Miles O'Neill transferred to North Carolina earlier this year.\n\nOn paper, Marcel Reed's backup will likely be incoming sophomore Brady Hart, who served as the No. 3 option last season and is well respected by the coaching staff, which has praised his maturity and accuracy despite being the youngest player on the roster. A former Michigan commit, Hart possesses enough arm talent and now a year of experience to be trusted in the No. 2 role.\n\nStill, it's highly unlikely Elko adds another veteran arm, and with 2025 four-star signee Helaman Casuga, Brady Hart will immediately compete with the freshman phenom, who has continued to show off his impressive accuracy and touch during Friday's Polynesian Bowl, as the Utah high school standout found 2027 five-star Ohio State commit for one of the better throws you'll see all weekend.\n\nCasuga is a much more fluid athlete than Brady Hart and fits the mold of what Elko and new offensive coordinator Holmon Wiggins are looking for in making plays out of the pocket. However, his lack of experience at the college level will hinder his ability to secure the backup job, but anything is possible.\n\nCasuga finished his career at Corner Canyon HS with 11,516 yards, 113 touchdowns, and 32 interceptions, combined with 1,083 rushing yards and 18 touchdowns.\n\nNice throw from Texas A&M QB signee @HelamanCasuga. https://t.co/erKpgmde5v\n\n— Carter Karels (@CarterKarels) January 17, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Watch QB Helaman Casuga's impressive throw during Polynesian Bowl",

    "fullText": "The Texas A&M basketball team enters rivalry weekend looking to reset after a grueling double‑overtime loss to Tennessee. It was a tough shooting night across the board, and the Aggies will aim to get back on track Saturday when they travel to Austin to face the Texas Longhorns.\n\nFor head coach Bucky McMillan, it marks his first experience in the Lone Star Showdown — and an opportunity to do something no A&M coach has accomplished since 2001: win in Austin. He understands exactly what this rivalry means to Aggies everywhere, but he’s also pushing his team to stay grounded and avoid getting swept up in the noise.\n\n\" ...our players got to block out all the noise and just know that our success going to in this game is going to be on their ability to focus on the things that equate to winning basketball\"\n\nIt’s not about minimizing the rivalry, McMillan emphasized, but recognizing the bigger picture. The SEC grind is long, and every conference game carries weight. That perspective has been reinforced by A&M’s 3–1 start in league play — a stretch that has boosted the team’s confidence despite the close calls.\n\n\"it's been great and that's why I say we can get caught up like a game slips away here or there where you're right there to win it. But there's also a lot of games on the flipside of that that we executed and won,\"\n\nA win on Saturday would move the Aggies to 4–1 in SEC play, a meaningful early‑season marker that could pay dividends later in the year. For McMillan, the message remains simple: play their style, trust their habits, and let the chips fall where they may.\n\nBelow, you can watch the full press conference with Coach Bucky.\n\nTexas A&M will face the Texas Longhorns in Austin at the Moody Center on Saturday, January 17, at 5 p.m. CT.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A Cuban immigrant died in a Texas immigration detention facility earlier this month during an altercation with guards, and the local medical examiner has indicated that his death will likely be classified as a homicide.\n\nThe federal government has provided a differing account surrounding the Jan. 3 death of Geraldo Lunas Campos, saying the detainee was attempting suicide and staff tried to save him.\n\nA witness told The Associated Press that Lunas Campos died after he was handcuffed, tackled by guards and placed in a chokehold until he lost consciousness. The immigrant’s family was told by the El Paso County Medical Examiner’s Office on Wednesday that a preliminary autopsy report said the death was a homicide resulting from asphyxia from chest and neck compression, according to a recording of the call reviewed by the AP.\n\nThe death and conflicting accounts have intensified scrutiny into the conditions of immigration jails at a time when the government has been rounding up immigrants in large numbers around the country and detaining them at facilities like the one in El Paso where Lunas Campos died.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is legally required to issue public notification of detainee deaths. Last week, it said Lunas Campos, a 55-year-old father of four and registered sex offender, had died at Camp East Montana, but made no mention of him being involved in an altercation with staff immediately before his death.\n\nIn response to questions from the AP, the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, on Thursday amended its account of Lunas Campos’ death, saying he tried to kill himself.\n\n“Campos violently resisted the security staff and continued to attempt to take his life,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said. “During the ensuing struggle, Campos stopped breathing and lost consciousness.”\n\nIn an interview before DHS updated its account, detainee Santos Jesús Flores, 47, from El Salvador, said he witnessed the incident through the window of his cell in the special housing unit, where detainees are held in isolation for disciplinary infractions.\n\n“He didn’t want to enter the cell where they were going to put him,” Flores told the AP on Thursday, speaking in Spanish from a phone in the facility. “The last thing he said was that he couldn’t breathe.”\n\nAmong the first sent to Camp Montana East\n\nCamp Montana East is a sprawling tent facility hastily constructed in the desert on the grounds of Fort Bliss, an Army base. The AP reported in August that the $1.2 billion facility, expected to become the largest detention facility in the United States, was being built and operated by a private contractor headquartered in a single-family home in Richmond, Virginia. The company, Acquisition Logistics LLC, had no prior experience running a corrections facility.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the guards present when Lunas Campos died were government employees or those of the private contractor. Emails seeking comment on Thursday from Acquisition Logistics executives received no response.\n\nLunas Campos was among the first detainees sent to Camp Montana East, arriving in September after ICE arrested him in Rochester, New York, where he lived for more than two decades. He was legally admitted to the U.S. in 1996, part of a wave of Cuban immigrants seeking to reach Florida by boat.\n\nICE said he was picked up in July as part of a planned immigration enforcement operation due to criminal convictions that made him eligible for removal.\n\nNew York court records show Lunas Campos was convicted in 2003 of sexual contact with an individual under 11, a felony for which he was sentenced to one year in jail and placed on the state’s sex offender registry.\n\nLunas Campos was also sentenced to five years in prison and three years of supervision in 2009 after being convicted of attempting to sell a controlled substance, according to the New York corrections records. He completed the sentence in January 2017.\n\nLunas Campos’ adult daughter said the child sexual abuse accusation was false, made as part of a contentious custody battle.\n\n“My father was not a child molester,” said Kary Lunas, 25. “He was a good dad. He was a human being.”\n\nOn the day he died, according to ICE, Lunas Campos became disruptive while in line for medication and refused to return to his assigned dorm. He was then taken to the segregation block.\n\n“While in segregation, staff observed him in distress and contacted on-site medical personnel for assistance,” the agency said in its Jan. 9 release. “Medical staff responded, initiated lifesaving measures, and requested emergency medical services.”\n\nLunas Campos was pronounced dead after paramedics arrived.\n\nFlores said that account omitted key details — Lunas Campos was already handcuffed when at least five guards pinned him to the floor, and at least one squeezed his arm around the detainee's neck.\n\nWithin about five minutes, Flores said, Lunas Campos was no longer moving.\n\n“After he stopped breathing, they removed the handcuffs,” Flores said.\n\nFlores is not represented by a lawyer and said he has already consented to deportation to his home country. Though he acknowledged he was taking a risk by speaking to the AP, Flores said he wanted to highlight that “in this place, guards abuse people a lot.”\n\nHe said multiple detainees in the unit witnessed the altercation, and security cameras there should have captured the events. Flores also said investigators had not interviewed him.\n\nDHS did not respond to questions about whether Lunas Campos was handcuffed when they say he attempted suicide, or exactly how he had tried to kill himself.\n\n“ICE takes seriously the health and safety of all those detained in our custody,” McLaughlin said. “This is still an active investigation, and more details are forthcoming.”\n\nDHS wouldn’t say whether other agencies were investigating. The El Paso medical examiner’s office confirmed Thursday that it conducted an autopsy, but declined further comment.\n\nA final determination of homicide by the medical examiner would typically be critical in determining whether any guards are held criminally or civilly liable. When such deaths are ruled accidental or something other than homicide, they are less likely to trigger criminal investigations, while civil wrongful death lawsuits become harder to prove.\n\nThe fact that Lunas Campos died on an Army base could also limit state and local officials’ legal jurisdiction to investigate. An El Paso County District Attorney’s Office spokesperson declined to comment Thursday on whether it was involved in an investigation.\n\nThe deaths of inmates and other detainees after officers hold them face down and put pressure on their backs and necks to restrain them have been a problem in law enforcement for decades. A 2024 AP investigation documented hundreds of deaths during police encounters in which people were restrained in a prone position. Many uttered “I can’t breathe” before suffocating, according to scores of body camera and bystander videos. Authorities often attempt to shift the blame for such deaths to preexisting medical conditions or drug use.\n\nDr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist who has studied prone restraint deaths, said the preliminary autopsy ruling of homicide indicates guards' actions caused Lunas Campos’ death, but does not mean they intended to kill. He said the medical examiner’s office could come under pressure to stop short of calling it a homicide, but will probably “stick to its guns.”\n\n“This probably passes the ‘but for’ test. ‘But for’ the actions of the officers, he would not have died. For us, that’s generally a homicide,” he said.\n\n‘I just want justice, and his body here’\n\nJeanette Pagan-Lopez, the mother of Lunas Campos’ two youngest children, said the day after he died the medical examiner’s office called to inform her that his body was at the county morgue. She immediately called ICE to find out what happened.\n\nPagan-Lopez, who lives in Rochester, said the assistant director of the El Paso ICE field office eventually called her back. She said the official told her the cause of death was still pending and that they were awaiting toxicology report results. He also told her the only way Lunas Campos’ body could be returned to Rochester free of charge was if she consented to his being cremated, she said.\n\nPagan-Lopez declined and is now seeking help from family and friends to raise the money needed to ship his body home and pay for a funeral.\n\nAfter failing to get details about the circumstances surrounding his death from ICE, Pagan-Lopez said she got a call from a detainee at Camp Montana East who then put her in touch with Flores, who first told her about the altercation with guards.\n\nSince then, she said she has repeatedly called ICE, but is no longer getting a response. Pagan-Lopez, who is a U.S. citizen, said she also twice called the FBI, where an agent took her information and then hung up.\n\nPagan-Lopez said she and Lunas Campos were together about 15 years before breaking up eight years ago. She described him as an attentive father who, until his detention, had worked in a minimum-wage job at a furniture store, the only employment she said he could find due to his criminal record.\n\nShe said that in the family's last phone call the week after Christmas, Lunas Campos talked to his kids about his expected deportation back to Cuba. He said he wanted them to visit the island, so that he could stay in their lives.\n\n“He wasn’t a bad guy,” Pagan-Lopez said. “I just want justice, and his body here. That’s all I want.”\n\nAttanasio reported from Seattle, and Foley from Iowa City.\n\nContact the AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org or https://www.ap.org/tips/.",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M's transfer portal haul now includes 18 commits, led by Alabama transfer wide receiver Isaiah Horton. After missing out on Auburn transfer wideout Cam Coleman, who committed to Texas, the Aggies possess one of the most complete wide receiver rotations in the country. While starting quarterback Marcel Reed is well-equipped next season, any success will start in the trenches.\n\nWith the NFL Draft declaration deadline up, five 2025 offensive linemen are off to the next level, including junior left guard Chase Bisontis, who would have likely returned if it weren't for his first or second round draft grade. Needing at least four replacements, head coach Mike Elko and O-line coach Adam Cushing immediately went to work, adding LSU tackle Tyree Adams and LSU guard Coen Echols, who was once an A&M commit.\n\nFurther shoring up the depth chart, Alabama guard/tackle Wilkin Formby, along with veteran South Carolina guard Trovon Baugh, committed to the Aggies, as all four players will compete for starting spots heading into the spring practice period.\n\nTexas A&M's defensive line rotation was also thin entering the new year, but the new additions of Northwestern edge Anto Saka, San Diego State edge Ryan Henderson, and defensive linemen CJ Mims (North Carolina), Angelo McCullom (Illinois), and Colorado transfer Brandon Davis-Swain make this group look formidable on paper at the very least.\n\nHowever, Texas A&M's 2026 secondary has a chance to be one of the top cornerback/safety rotations in the SEC, as senior corners Dezz Ricks and Julio Humphrey will return, and combined with transfer corner Rickey Gibson, this group is primed to be in lockdown mode on nearly every passing play. At safety, Colorado transfer Tawfiq Byard is extremely versatile and one of the top coverage safeties, having not allowed a passing touchdown in over 500 coverage snaps.\n\nWhile the Aggies could still add a running back, many, including myself, believe this group is all but complete, and, according to On3's transfer portal rankings, is the fourth-ranked transfer cycle, and No. 1 among SEC programs, positioned below Virginia Tech (3), Texas Tech (2), and Indiana (1).\n\nIn today's college football landscape, \"adapt or die\" is the prevailing mentality: either sink or stay above water. If adding double-digit transfers isn't the first priority at the end of every season, relying on younger players usually results in an average-to-below-average season.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M's 2026 transfer portal class ranked Top 5 nationally",

    "fullText": "Editor’s Note: This story is the third installment in a series produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center’s AI Accountability Network.\n\nGoliad County police kicked off one human smuggling investigation not with a suspect’s name, but with a discarded receipt and cell phone surveillance software. In June 2021, Chief Deputy Tim Futch chased a speeding F-150 headed toward Houston on U.S. Highway 59; he believed the vehicle was carrying undocumented immigrants, concealed in the truck bed beneath plywood, according to a police report. Trying to evade the cops, the driver pulled into a ditch, and around 10 people bailed out and took off sprinting.\n\nIn the aftermath, Roy Boyd, the sheriff in this county of 7,000 situated halfway between Laredo and Houston, surveyed the scene. The driver proved hard to identify via the pickup’s plate. But, on the ground, he spotted a fresh receipt from a liquor store in Pasadena, a Houston suburb, he recalled in a June 2024 interview with the Texas Observer.\n\nThe stub of paper was enough, Boyd said, to justify deploying an expensive—and controversial—artificial intelligence-powered surveillance tool called Tangles. A specially-trained analyst used the receipt, Boyd said, to conduct warrantless surveillance on the suspected driver—and on other smart phone users—by utilizing a Tangles add-on feature called Webloc, which tracks mobile devices’ movements in a client-selected virtual area through a capability called “geofencing.”\n\nAfter the bailout incident, Boyd acquired a license for the tool with about $300,000 in state border security grants—though the sheriff admits that he’s not a tech guy: In 2024, he still used a hand-me-down iPhone 10, which hit the market in 2017.\n\nA tall, slim, seventh-generation Texan, Boyd fits the archetype of a small-town Southern sheriff with his firm handshake and light drawl. He usually wears his sand-colored cowboy hat, leather belt, and a matching holster manufactured by prisoners in a neighboring county. The latter encases a silver Colt pistol engraved with “Remember Goliad,” referencing the Mexican army’s massacre of Anglo combatants who lost a battle in which Boyd says his ancestors died.\n\nBoyd worked as a career cop in the neighboring South Texas city of Victoria before being elected sheriff of Goliad County in 2020. He’s since hobnobbed with President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago and met repeatedly with border czar Tom Homan, and he leads a multijurisdictional task force named after Operation Lone Star, Governor Greg Abbott’s multi-billion dollar border militarization mission. The task force pools deputies and resources from nearly 60 Texas agencies mainly for anti-smuggling operations. It began with mostly rural departments, but it expanded to include more populous counties, the Texas National Guard, the U.S. Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the Coast Guard. Task force members have spent at least $300,000 on Tangles, and according to emails obtained from Goliad County, many have been granted access to the software, which can track mobile device movements via third-party commercial data.\n\nTangles scrapes information from the open, deep, and dark webs and is the premier product of Cobwebs Technologies, a cybersecurity company founded in 2014 by three former members of special units in the Israeli military. In 2023, the Nebraska-based tech firm PenLink Ltd acquired the company.\n\nThe software has been met with criticism from civil liberties advocates, especially given that its WebLoc add-on enables warrantless device tracking. Normally, when U.S. police officers seek cell phone records or location data, they must obtain a warrant by presenting probable cause of a crime to a judge. In 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Carpenter v. United States that warrants are required for obtaining location data from cell phone providers. But the rise of the multi-billion dollar data broker industry has created a free-for-all that enables police and others to purchase massive amounts of cell phone location data without judicial review.\n\nNathan Wessler, an ACLU attorney who argued the Carpenter case, said data broker-built services like Tangles pose the same privacy issues as those decided in the Supreme Court case and that law enforcement’s ability to buy location data constitutes an erosion of constitutionally protected rights. “Police are doing an end run around this well-articulated system of judicial oversight by just paying money instead of going to a judge,” he said. “There’s just no checks of police abuse against that.”\n\nIn the Goliad County case, a police analyst drew a virtual fence to examine an area that spanned about 300 miles between the Pasadena liquor store and the U.S.-Mexico border based on the day and time stamped on the receipt. He discovered that six phones used within a mile of the store had been tracked again later at a Texas immigration checkpoint, Boyd said. He didn’t specify which checkpoint; the U.S. Border Patrol has over a dozen of them in Texas, some permanent and some temporary.\n\nBoyd rattles off statistics about the success of his task force in tracking gangs, but he provided only the one example involving Tangles and never said whether the information they obtained by geofencing helped lead to any arrest. In response to records requests, the department said it had no reports that mentioned Tangles, despite the fact that Goliad has had the software for more than three years. The corresponding incident report for the case Boyd cited doesn’t mention Tangles, though he said an analyst used the software. It does state that the department collaborated with a Homeland Security Investigations analyst.\n\nGenerally, Boyd said his office uses the software to find “avenues for obtaining probable cause” or “to verify reasonable suspicion that you already have”—not as a basis by itself to make arrests.\n\nBeyond Goliad, Tangles has more powerful, deep-pocketed users. The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), for example, has invested heavily in the software. DPS spent nearly $200,000 on Tangles in 2021 as an emergency purchase related to Operation Lone Star, and the agency has repeatedly expanded its contract. In 2024, DPS inked a 5-year, $5.3-million contract for 230 named users. ICE’s Office of Intelligence signed a contract worth around $2 million to use the software in 2025, and the DEA in that same timeframe committed more than $10 million.\n\nBoyd and Caleb Breshears, a Goliad County deputy and the task force commander, argued in interviews that Tangles presents no privacy concerns since its location tracking software doesn’t reveal names, only device identification numbers in the online advertising ecosystem. Tangles users cannot search by name or by phone number; its location data is sourced from applications in which consumers consented to sharing their whereabouts, Breshears said.\n\nNor does Tangles reveal what vehicle is associated with a device, but combined with Texas’ broader arsenal of surveillance tools, which includes a fleet of drones and a network of automated license plate readers, “Those are things that we might be able to piece together,” Boyd said.\n\nPenLink Ltd, Tangles’ present owner, touts its worldwide successes in combating human trafficking, drug smuggling, and money laundering, but the company declined to provide specific examples to the Observer of how the platform has assisted in U.S. cases. “Penlink is proud to provide law enforcement with solutions that keep communities safe, protect people, rescue victims and solve crimes,” company spokesperson Kristine German said in a written statement. “Our technology enables law enforcement to spot threats faster and use evidence more efficiently to advance criminal investigations. The solutions we provide to the government exclusively use commercially available data. We follow industry best practices and comply with all relevant privacy laws, platform policies, and ethical standards.”\n\nIn El Salvador, where authoritarian president Nayib Bukele has suspended civil liberties, the national police force purchased Tangles in 2020, according to the investigative outlet El Faro. Just 13 months later, the state’s Bukele-controlled legislative assembly approved criminal code reforms that allowed the judicial use of information obtained via warrantless surveillance by tools like Tangles, clearing the way for the dictator’s state police to legally spy on citizens, El Faro reported. When asked about a repressive regime using its products, PenLink said the company does “not discuss specific customers or contracts.”\n\nPenLink pitches Tangles as an “open source intelligence” software that compiles publicly available information. Yet even Meta, the social media giant that owns Facebook and Instagram and has been denounced for stockpiling too much of its own users data, has accused Cobwebs Technologies, the company that invented Tangles, of operating as a “surveillance-for-hire” outfit; Meta banned Cobwebs Technologies from its platforms in 2021.\n\nIn a separate emailed statement, PenLink distanced itself from the Meta ban: “Penlink acquired Cobwebs in 2023, after those issues had been addressed and we are not aware of any issues since.”\n\nBut critics find U.S. law enforcement’s growing domestic use of an array of surveillance tools presents major risks to civil liberties by enabling police to build a robust profile of almost anyone’s life and movements without a warrant or probable cause. They find phone-tracking tools like Tangles to be particularly troubling.\n\n“There’s this veneer of respect for privacy that is painted over all of this data aggregation and consolidation,” said Beryl Lipton, a researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a California-based nonprofit focused on digital privacy-related civil liberties. Watchdog organizations like the EFF and ACLU have been forced to go to court to discover more information about its use: Last January, PenLink sued a California sheriff’s office in an attempt to prevent the department from releasing public records to EFF that contained details about the company’s products and prices, arguing they were “trade secret-protected information.” EFF intervened in the case and ultimately prevailed. The sheriff’s office handed over the records.\n\nSo far, federal and Texas agencies combined have committed to spending at least $8 million dollars specifically for Tangles, according to a year-long Observer investigation. Yet, agencies refuse to say how Tangles has benefitted Texas criminal or immigration probes. Boyd said he couldn’t think of a time that phone-tracking data has been directly linked to any arrest or prosecution in Goliad County, despite his agency’s task force role. “Most of that is probably going to be on the federal side and not so much on the state side,” Boyd said. “I can’t think of any time when [Tangles] has been used for the prosecution of somebody. … It has not been a key component in our cases.”\n\nDPS declined comment on its use of the costly technology. In response to a records request, the agency told the Observer it has no incident reports and only seven confidential internal investigative reports from 2023 and 2024 that mention “Cobwebs” (a shorthand sometimes used to refer to the the software named after the company that created it) or “Tangles,” but it withheld them claiming that releasing the documents could “provide wrong-doers, drug traffickers, terrorists, and other criminals with information concerning how Department operations are planned, implemented and staffed.”\n\nIn the last three years, many DPS investigators, police departments including those of major cities such as Dallas and Houston, and nearly 20 Texas sheriff’s offices have obtained a Tangles log-in. The larger agencies have been evasive about how and when they use the tool, declining to provide examples to the Observer.\n\nNo agencies contacted for this story provided examples of Tangles’ use in any specific criminal cases. Dallas Police Department spokesperson Corbin Rubinson said only that “Tangles has been in use by the Department for several years and is used consistently in criminal investigations. The WebLoc add-on is used less frequently and produces fewer investigative leads.” A Houston police spokesman said Tangles is used for “crime analysis, for supporting criminal Investigations, and for supporting situational awareness/threat assessments” and that the department does not use the WebLoc add-on that enables warrantless device tracking. Other agencies that purchased it, including the Killeen Police Department and the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office, did not respond.\n\nTexas agencies’ failure to produce reports on arrests or other results linked to the controversial technology has two possible interpretations, experts say. “Either this is just a massive waste of taxpayer money, right? They’re spending all this money on the tool that they’re not actually using,” said Wessler, the ACLU attorney, “or they’re using it and hiding it from judges, criminal defense attorneys, criminal defendants and the press, which is a big story in itself.”\n\nIn April, state Senator Sarah Eckhardt, an Austin Democrat, raised questions during a border security committee hearing about DPS’ investment of $20 million in multi-year contracts for various AI-powered social media monitoring tools like Tangles, following an earlier Observer report on the state police agency’s spending on surveillance tech.\n\nIn response, DPS Director Freeman Martin told Eckhardt and other committee members that such software has been critical in preventing mass shootings and said DPS had identified a potential school shooter using the technology.\n\nBut when the Observer approached Martin a few days later at a border sheriffs’ conference, he added only a few general observations, saying that the software has helped police save lives and make arrests.\n\n“If I talk about technology now, and we’re asking for funding, some people like it, some people hate it,” he said, clarifying that Tangles in particular was controversial after the Observer asked about the software. “We don’t want to lose those tools,” he said. “We want all the tools. When somebody’s threatening to shoot up the school, we got to find them. We can’t wait till school starts.”\n\nMartin initially promised to speak more about the agency’s successes with Tangles after the legislative session, which ended in June. But he never responded to requests for a follow-up interview made through his secretary and the agency’s communications office, nor did he answer a list of questions sent by the Observer.\n\nWessler, the ACLU attorney, is skeptical that Tangles has been used to prevent mass casualty events. He said in emergencies police can obtain warrants and send rapid requests to cell phone service providers, who generally can supply more up-to-date and accurate location data than third-party tools. “The claim that this has helped prevent mass shootings is really interesting, and sounds pretty far-fetched to me.”\n\nBreshears, the Goliad County task force leader, explained that the software’s underlying location data are typically days old. That means it does not allow for real-time tracking and is only useful when multiple factors align. “When you say ‘track’, technically it’s correct, but … I’m not tracking you live. I can only see where you have been,” Breshears said. “It’s all historical information.”\n\nTexas law does not explicitly require police to document use of AI-powered surveillance tech, so police reports may not be a reliable indicator of whether Tangles has been used even in investigations that led to arrests. In the 2025 legislative session, Southlake Republican Giovanni Capriglione introduced a bill that would have mandated government agencies using AI to disclose use of these systems to “consumers.” It is unclear how that might have applied to police reports, which under the public information act already can be heavily redacted under certain circumstances, especially if an investigation is ongoing. Legislators ultimately passed an overhauled version of the bill that does not explicitly require police to document or disclose use of AI.\n\nUnder due process rules and Texas’ Michael Morton Act, prosecutors must share relevant investigative reports, videos, and other related information to anyone charged with a crime. But the Observer reached out to all 80 federal public defender offices, emailed Texas defense attorneys and Dallas’ district attorney, and interviewed a longtime Houston public defender and a former Goliad-area prosecutor, yet no one provided information about Tangles being mentioned in records disclosed to them while representing a client or charging a defendant in criminal court.\n\nAmrutha Jindal, executive director of Lone Star Defenders, which provides public defenders for migrants prosecuted under Operation Lone Star, said she had never come across any evidence the software had been used in any of the nonprofit’s cases. “Alarms are ringing in my head,” Jindal said in a phone interview. “There’s also a question of—are we even being told?”\n\nThe Observer found many examples in police records of how Texas state troopers have surveilled the homes of immigrants or made pre-textual traffic stops to help ICE target and detain people who were not charged with a crime. However, it is unclear whether state police used Tangles or other surveillance tools. The Observer reached out to a network of more than 60 immigration attorneys in Texas and beyond, and none offered examples of how this software may have been used against their clients.\n\nIn Washington D.C., the district’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency (HSEMA) has purchased Tangles for several years, though it has not said how it deploys the tool; in August, the ACLU of DC filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking records.\n\nOne of the executives at PenLink, the parent company that sells Tangles, is Derek Maltz, a former DEA agent who participated in Border 911, a political nonprofit, with others who are now homeland security leaders in the Trump administration. He served as PenLink’s executive director of government relations from 2014 to 2025. Throughout that time, the DEA doled out more than $100 million in contracts with PenLink for its various products, according to public federal spending data. Maltz left the company to serve as the DEA’s acting director for five months after Trump’s second inauguration. Last summer, Maltz pivoted back to PenLink, where he became senior vice president of global business growth and strategy. Since Maltz re-joined PenLink last July, the company has garnered about $3.4 million \n\nIn a written statement, a PenLink spokesperson said: “Derek Maltz is a veteran national security and law enforcement leader who brings 28 years of federal law enforcement experience to his role at Penlink. His appointment as Acting Administrator speaks to his expertise in this field, and we are pleased to welcome him back to Penlink. We are compliant with Federal Post-Employment Restrictions.” Maltz did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nParomita Shah, an attorney and co-founder of Just Futures Law, a legal advocacy group focused on the intersection of immigration and surveillance issues, said Maltz’s case illustrates a well-established revolving door between tech companies and the federal government. “As much as these guys complain about the swamp, they certainly benefit from it,” Shah said.\n\nLocal agencies from New York to California have also bought Tangles. In Arizona, the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office—a populous county about halfway between Phoenix and Tucson—paid more than $90,000 in 2022 and 2023 to use the platform. In an email, Pinal County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Sam Salzwedel noted that deputies have deployed Tangles for a “variety of investigations, large and small,” but declined to share any success stories, citing law enforcement sensitivity. Salzwedel said that WebLoc, the warrantless phone tracking feature, appeared to be used sparingly.\n\n“I have not surveyed our handful of users, but one of our analysts just told me he has only used it a few times,” Salzwedel wrote in an email. “No warrant was obtained.”\n\nA reimbursement request released by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the privacy-focused nonprofit, and first reported by the Arizona Mirror, offers a few anecdotes about how Tucson police have used Tangles: To surveil protesters during one of former Vice President Kamala Harris’s visits to the state and to track and identify a suspect accused in a string of Circle K cigarette robberies. Tucson police also apparently used Tangles in an attempt to find the culprit behind an attempted abduction of a young woman, but without success.\n\nEven police who possess Tangles, like Boyd, warn of its potential for abuse. He says his department seldom deploys it for fear of violating constitutional privacy rights—and that despite leading a police task force, the sheriff is skeptical of cops collecting too much sensitive information.\n\n“Do you really want all your stuff in a database where any law enforcement official can go in and just find out what you’ve got going on, or where you’ve been going on any given day?” he said. “I just don’t think that the government needs a catch-all where they can obtain whatever information they want on you at a moment’s notice.”",

    "fullText": "Two Brownsville police officers helped a homeless man during a cold morning patrol\n\nBody camera footage of the encounter spread widely on social media\n\nOfficer Gonzalo Rubio says the moment reflects everyday acts of service that often go unseen\n\nA routine patrol through downtown Brownsville turned into a viral moment after two police officers stopped to help a homeless man on a cold morning. The interaction, later shared widely online, struck a chord far beyond the Texas city.\n\nAccording to the Brownsville Police Department, Officers Gonzalo Rubio and Francisco Maldonado encountered the man early in the morning while driving through the downtown area. The department said the officers noticed the chilly weather and realized the man needed warm, dry clothing.\n\n“Noticing the chilly weather and seeing that the man needed warm, dry clothing, the officers stepped in to help,” the department explained in a Facebook post,\n\nOfficer Rubio, who grew up in Brownsville, later reflected on the moment as part of everyday policing. “They’re not bothering anybody, they’re not doing anything wrong, and we just happen to be driving by,” he said of people often seen resting in the area.\n\nThe cold morning raised immediate concern when the officers saw the man trembling despite having a blanket. Rubio explained that when they tried to help, they realized the man wasn't wearing any pants, making the situation more urgent.\n\nAccording to Rubio, his partner immediately suggested buying clothing to keep the man warm. The officers worried the man might leave, so they asked dispatch to keep an eye on him while they went to purchase sweatpants.\n\nWhen the officers returned, the man was still there. It’s the moment they reunited with him and helped him get dressed that was captured on video by a nearby passerby.\n\nThe Brownsville Police Department later shared the body-worn camera footage on Facebook, calling it a moment of “service and humanity.” “In an act of compassion, Officers Rubio and Maldonado purchased new sweatpants for the man to ensure he stayed warm and comfortable,” the department wrote.\n\nAs the video spread, Rubio expressed surprise at the attention it received. “Sometimes it just goes away, like okay, whatever, that’s nice, but this one kept happening,” he said.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nRubio added that the viral clip showed only a small part of the job. “It was a rainy day, we still had 12 hours to go, so much other stuff happened that day that nobody knows about,” he said.\n\nFor the department, the moment reflected its broader mission. “The Brownsville Police Department is proud of our compassionate officers who continue to embody our commitment to serving our community with dignity, empathy, and respect,” the Facebook post concluded.",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M (13-4, 3-1 SEC) lost its first SEC game of the year on the road vs. No. 24 Tennessee, falling to the Vols in double overtime 87-82 in a game where the Aggies led until the final five minutes. Due to Tennessee's size advantage, which has been the case throughout SEC play, Texas A&M was outrebounded 60-35, including 24 offensive rebounds that led to more than 20 points.\n\nFirst-year head coach Bucky McMillan has had to resort to small ball after losing transfer forward Mackenzie Mgbako for the year, whose size and shooting ability would have likely resulted in a win on Tuesday, while starting forward Rashaun Agee, who is listed at 6'7\", but likely shorter, leads the Aggies in rebounding with 8.6 per game.\n\nStill, this is the hand McMillan has been dealt, and his team continues to play with a ton of heart and physicality, and should be 16-1 if it weren't for late-game issues against UCF, SMU, and the final seconds against Tennessee.\n\nHowever, the Aggies should have gotten the ball back with just under ten seconds remaining in regulation after senior guard Rylan Griffin's near rebound was hit out of bounds by a Tennessee player, but the refs apparently did not see enough evidence to overturn the call. Either way, missed free throws, finishing 21-32 from the stripe, ultimately cost the Aggies in the end.\n\nTexas A&M is ahead of schedule in Year 1 of McMillan's tenure in College Station, and while Tuesday's loss was frustrating for the fan base, ESPN bracketology expert Joe Lunardi was seemingly impressed with the Aggies' performance in one of the toughest environments the SEC has to offer, placing McMillan's veteran squad as one of the Last Four Byes alonside Kentucky, USC, and Wisconsin.\n\nStill, Texas A&M needs to pick up more Quad 1 wins to have any shot of making the NCAA Tournament, with another opportunity on Saturday night against rival Texas in Austin.\n\n— Joe Lunardi (@ESPNLunardi) January 14, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M rises in ESPN's Bracketology despite losing to Tennessee",

That dream narrows quickly after high school, and even for those talented enough to play at the collegiate level, the odds of landing on a professional roster remain slim. But unlike several other sports, football requires a massive number of bodies to function, and scouts flock to end‑of‑season showcases for one reason: finding a diamond in the rough.\n\nTexas A&M has several players projected to come off the board within the first two days of the 2026 NFL Draft. For those athletes, skipping an All‑Star event might be the smart play. For others, these games represent a final opportunity to get in front of evaluators who could ultimately pound the table for them in draft rooms this spring.\n\nTaurean York has been a constant in Aggieland, staying through the coaching transition and emerging as the heartbeat of the defense. His football IQ, leadership, and command of the unit will be difficult to replace, but he played a major role in preparing the next wave of linebackers to take the reins. While he doesn’t boast prototypical size or elite speed, he consistently puts himself in a position to make plays and elevate those around him.\n\nAfter a historic junior season, York has officially declared for the 2026 NFL Draft and accepted an invitation to the East‑West Shrine Bowl. It’s a chance to showcase his instincts, intelligence, and competitiveness in front of NFL scouts one more time as he looks to solidify his place at the next level.\n\nInvitation Accepted@AggieFootball LB Taurean York (@TaureanYork5x) is locked in for the East-West Shrine Bowl! 👍#GigEm | #ShrineBowlWHOSNEXT 😎 pic.twitter.com/bOPLsOGjYv\n\n— East-West Shrine Bowl (@ShrineBowl) January 12, 2026\n\nThe 2026 East-West Shrine Bowl kicks off January 27 at Ford Center at The Star in Frisco, Texas\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes, and opinions.
