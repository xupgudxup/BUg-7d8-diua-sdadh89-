    "fullText": "Texas A&M's 2026 wide receiver rotation is all but complete after landing a massive commitment from Alabama transfer wideout Isaiah Horton, who, after entering the portal on Thursday, took one visit to College Station this weekend, and announced his intention to play for the Aggies on Sunday night.\n\nLast season, Texas A&M's one and only weakness in its wide receiver rotation was the lack of size on the boundary, which also hurt the red zone offense, lacking a 50/50 deep shot threat that could stretch the field and help starting quarterback Marcel Reed spread the ball around at every level of the field.\n\nWith the return of star wide receiver Mario Craver, along with ascending wideouts Ashton Bethel-Roman and Terry Bussey, combined with several incoming freshmen, speed and separation aren't an issue, and Horton provides stability as a man-beater on the outside to create chunk gains and open up the offense.\n\nLast season, Marcel Reed threw for 3,192 yards and 25 touchdowns, with seven of those scores coming off deep shots of 20 yards or more, while his 39% completion percentage on those throws should improve with Horton's size posing an advantage. While five of his eleven interceptions came between the numbers, four were thrown along the left boundary, mainly due to the lack of size at wide receiver against average-sized defensive backs.\n\nMario Craver is one of the fastest players in college football, but is a mere 5'9\", and should have his best season yet in the Z or slot receiver role with Hortmon on the field, as the coverage will now have to focus on the Alabama transfer, especially if he finds early success in SEC play.\n\nBarring any changes, including Auburn transfer WR Malcolm Simmon's impending decision and Colorado transfer receiver Dre'Lon Miller's visit to College Station this weekend, Isaiah Hortmon looks like the final piece of the puzzle for Texas A&M's 2026 wide receiver corps.\n\nIf the 2025 Texas A&M WR group had one weakness, it was their lack of a big-bodied WRs who can be an outside man beater and grab 50-50 balls. New A&M WR Isaiah Horton can be that guy and led Alabama with eight receiving TDs in 2025. pic.twitter.com/Ui86ViPjcQ\n\n— Carter Karels (@CarterKarels) January 11, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M's 2026 WR corps looks complete after adding Isaiah Horton",

    "fullText": "Yet another data center will soon emerge near the Far Westside of San Antonio, according to a recent Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) filing. It's set to further the Lone Star State's reputation as a tech cluster.\n\nThe quaint town of Castroville, with a population of just over 3,000, will soon house a $400 million development owned by Microsoft. Online records show that the project, named SAT 82, will take up roughly 195,000 square feet in Medina County.\n\nAlthough it's only a one-story building, it will take nearly two years to build, according to the TDLR. Construction at the spot, 3580 FM 471 North, will begin on Thursday, August 13, 2026. A visit to the property revealed that equipment and a welcome poster were already on site. An open field, a two-lane road, and residential properties sit nearby.\n\nIn time, the structure will likely take on the look of a windowless warehouse. It may be hard for residents to get a clear glimpse of the center, as each contains extensive fencing around its perimeters for safety and security purposes, Microsoft's website states.\n\nSAT 82 joins six others in Medina County, according to the TDLR: SAT 80, SAT 81, SAT 89/90, SAT 93, SAT 94, and another with the title SAT 82, but with a different address.\n\nThe centers provide the infrastructure needed to open a phone application, join a virtual Zoom meeting, play an online game, and more. According to the company's website, they also allow the company's Azure cloud platform, AI, and collaboration tools to continue operating as normal.\n\nEarlier this fall, community members in a private Redbird Ranch neighborhood Facebook group voiced concerns over Microsoft's presence in the area. A few users worried the company's projects would worsen traffic. Others highlighted the massive amount of water that data centers use.\n\nIn a 2024 sustainability report, Microsoft said that its water consumption in 2023 - which includes but is not limited to data centers - increased by 1.7 billion gallons from the previous year, coming in at 2.1 billion gallons. The company attributed the increase to its business growth.\n\n\"Improvements as part of our Redmond campus modernization project are estimated to yield over 50% reduction in water use for new facilities,\" it continued in the report.\n\nConstruction on the property is expected to wrap up by 2028, according to the TDLR.\n\nThis article originally published at Microsoft bets $400M on tiny Texas town with new massive data center.",

    "fullText": "After missing his \"College Gameday\" appearance before the Aggies competed against the Hurricanes in the first round of the CFP, former Heisman-winning quarterback and Texas A&M legend Johnny Manziel explained his side of the story on his Glory Daze podcast.\n\nAccording to Manziel, he missed the scheduled appearance as a guest picker due to a virus that made him sick the night before. He originally planned to attend with music artist Drake and watch Texas A&M take on Miami, but the illness prevented that.\n\nManziel played for the Aggies in 2012 and 2013, becoming the first-ever freshman Heisman winner and just the second player to win the award in program history. Here is the full clip of Manziel discussing the incident that led to his missed appearance.\n\nFormer Texas A&M QB Johnny Manziel explained on his podcast what went into him missing his scheduled “College GameDay” appearance for A&M vs. Miami. He said he planned to go to the game with Drake but got sick the night before with an “unbelievable” virus. https://t.co/jYbSoxsig8 pic.twitter.com/Z7guLzSghd\n\n— Carter Karels (@CarterKarels) January 8, 2026\n\nWhile rumors ran rampant across social media when former Aggie basketball player Alex Caruso was named the guest picker in place of Manziel, he seemed to shut those down on the most recent episode of his podcast. Manziel was in attendance for multiple contests at Kyle Field in 2025, while also spending time with current Texas A&M quarterback Marcel Reed, who displayed much improvement this season at the helm and will return to play for the Maroon and White for his junior season.\n\nThe year didn't conclude as the Aggies had wished, but head coach Mike Elko has led the program to historic heights in just his second season coaching in Bryan-College Station, Texas. Elko's squad secured the school's first 11-0 start since 1992 and its first playoff appearance in 2025.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Dylan on X: @dylanmflippo.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Former Texas A&M QB Johnny Manziel explains \"College Gameday\" absence",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M (13-3, 3-0 SEC) stayed undefeated in the SEC after defeating Oklahoma 83-76 on Saturday night, aided by four Aggies scoring in double figures, led by senior forward Rashuan Agee's 16 points and 12 rebounds for his seventh double-double on the year. In attendance, Texas A&M football head coach Mike Elko hosted several key transfer portal players, who collectively enjoyed one of the weekend's best games.\n\nOn Friday night, it was revealed that the Aggies were set to host Alabama transfer wide receiver Isaiah Horton amid Auburn star receiver Cam Coleman's impending decision, and while Horton was not in attendance for the game, Elko was accompanied by former Aggie recruiting target and Colorado transfer receiver Dre'Lon Miller and Illinois transfer defensive tackle Angelo McCullom.\n\nAnother confirmed visitor, Miami transfer DL Donta Simpson Jr, further proves that Elko and his staff are looking add more beef to the defensive line after landing standout transfer edge rushers Ryan Henderson and Anto Naka, who will look to replace unanimous All-American Cashius Howell. Landing either McCullom or Simpson, or both, would complete the 2026 defensive line room.\n\nCam Coleman's recent visit to Alabama could put the Crimson Tide ahead of the Aggies, Texas, and Texas Tech, but that's yet to be determined after the Alabama native returned home before making his final decision. Landing Isaiah Horton wouldn't just be insurance if Coleman isn't an option, but an elite addition to an already established, yet undersized WR Room.\n\nLastly, Dre'Lon Miller is a familiar face who was underutilized during his time at Colorado, and while he doesn't possess Horton's size, his speed and versatility would make up for KC Concepcion's departure.\n\nUpdate: Some conflicting info on the Horton ID in video.

    "fullText": "According to On3’s Hayes Fawcett, the Texas Longhorns have landed a commitment from linebacker Rasheem Biles out of the NCAA transfer portal. Biles spent the last two seasons with the Pitt Panthers, turning into an All-ACC player. Steve Sarkisian and new defensive coordinator Will Muschamp now take over his talents, hoping it translates in the SEC.\n\nLinebacker has been a position of importance for Texas in the transfer portal this offseason. There has been plenty of turnover there, both due to the 2026 NFL Draft and guys leaving for other schools. Somebody with the ability to bring an immediate impact was needed in Austin, and Biles is the guy.\n\nBiles played in 10 games last season for Pitt, starting in nine of them. A total of 101 tackles, 17 tackles for a loss, and 4.5 interceptions proved to be good enough for second-team All-ACC honors. You can add in two interceptions (both of which were returned for touchdowns), six passes defended, two forced fumbles, and a fumble recovery. Basically, Biles was all over the field this past year.\n\nIf those stats were not enough, the On3 Industry Transfer Portal rankings believe one of the very best is heading to Texas. Biles is a four-star prospect and the No. 16 overall player to enter this cycle. Nobody is ranked higher when it comes to the linebacker position, either.\n\nPlenty of other schools were interested in Biles’ commitment during the transfer process. The likes of Colorado, Miami, Michigan, and Ohio State were a part of the discussion at one point. Instead, Texas found a way to get this one over the finish line.\n\nThe Longhorns are coming off a disappointing season, going 9-3 and missing the College Football Playoff. Sarkisian is working to retool the roster so the same fate is not shared at the conclusion of the 2026 season. Plenty of work remains but snagging somebody like Biles is a massive step in the right direction.\n\nTexas will open the ’26 campaign on Sept. 5 vs. Texas State, where you can assume it will be debut day for Biles. One week later will grab all the attention, though, as Ohio State comes to Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium for the first time since 2006.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire. The On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M's 2026 running back room could feature a new face from the transfer portal, and while Baylor transfer back Bryson Washington made his way to College Station this weekend, Washington is now in the mix for the Texas native, which have have made a significant push this week. However, this doesn't rule out the Aggies landing a transfer running back, as a new name has emerged.\n\nAccording to AggieYell insider Jaxson Callaway, Texas A&M is now targeting Michigan State transfer running back Makhi Frazier, who is reportedly coming off a Friday visit to Ohio State. While this may seem daunting, the Aggies have won multiple transfer battles against the Buckeyes this month. Still, adding another running back isn't A&M's top priority compared to other programs.\n\nWashington is still the No. 1 running back target for head coach Mike Elko and his staff, and Callaway is right to state that the rest of the RB portal market will depend on Washington's choice regarding which way the Huskies will go.\n\n\"At the moment, much of the running back market appears to be waiting on Washington’s decision.\"\n\nFocusing on Frazier, the McKinney, Texas native is listed at 5'10\" and nearly 220 pounds, and is coming off an impressive 2025 sophomore campaign after rushing for 520 yards and two touchdowns, averaging 4.5 yards per carry.\n\nPer Pro Football Focus, Frazier earned a solid offensive grade (74.8) and a rushing grade (77.6), which bodes well for his future as a potential starting or No. 2 running back. Frazier will continue to be a name to watch, but until Bryson Washington makes his decision, both players will be the top backs on the Aggies' radar.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Transfer RB Makhi Frazier has emerged as a Texas A&M target",

The Longhorns ' sophomore recorded 399 rushing yards on 92 carries. That was the second-most on the team, trailing only Quintrevion Wisner, who is now a Seminole. Regardless of the opponent, Manning found a way to make an impact.\n\nAlthough Manning had an up-and-down start, he got better as the season went on. When he was locked in Texas was hard to stop and held their own against ranked teams. While the Longhorns did not qualify for the College Football Playoff, they did finish with 10 wins and beat Michigan in the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl.\n\nArch Manning outrunning the entire defense for 60 yards \nHe was absolutely rolling pic.twitter.com/rhhOKpsgSa\n\n— Bengal (@BengalYouTube) December 31, 2025\n\nAs Manning begins preparing for his junior campaign, he will be watching how the voting for the award named after his uncles plays out. While it is a crowded field, the former five-star recruit made a compelling case with his play as the season winded down. The winner will be revealed on January 19th, after the College Football Playoff National Championship.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Longhorns Wire: Texas Football QB Arch Manning named finalist for Manning Award",

    "description": "The Tide will look to get back in the win column following a 96-90 loss on the road to Vanderbilt. Here are three bold takes for the Texas game.",
    "fullText": "The Alabama Crimson Tide will host the Texas Longhorns at Coleman Coliseum on Saturday night.\n\nThe Tide enter the matchup following a Top 15 road loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, as a multitude of injuries ultimately cost Alabama the game. Labaron Philon Jr. recorded 18 points on 5-of-9 shooting despite playing just 19 minutes, as the star guard left the game with full-body cramps and was unable to return in the second half.\n\nAden Holloway and Latrell Wrightsell could see an increase in playing time, should Philon remain sidelined, but the Tide will look to get the sharpshooter back from injury as soon as possible, starting with this game against Texas.\n\nHere are three bold takes for Alabama's matchup against Texas.\n\nHolloway recorded 22 points on 9-of-18 shooting during Wednesday night's loss, as the junior guard was able to step up and play at an elite level following Philon's injury. The former Auburn star could thrive once again if Philon is unable to play, as the sharpshooter has proven to shine with an increased workload on numerous occasions in the past. Holloway is currently shooting an impressive 46.7% from behind the arc, as the star will look to stay hot on Saturday evening.\n\nSherrell has played a critical role on both ends of the floor for the Crimson Tide. The talented big man currently leads the team in blocks with 2.8 per game, and Sherrell's presence on the glass has undoubtedly been missed while he has been sidelined. The sophomore forward could be in prime position for a major performance should he return on Saturday night, as the Tide continue to slowly get healthier as the season progresses.\n\nAllen has continued to turn heads throughout the first few months of the 2025-26 season. The impressive freshman led the Crimson Tide in points with 25 during Wednesday night's loss in Nashville, as Allen has quickly earned himself a much larger role and has thrived in recent weeks. Allen could benefit from Philon's injury should he remain out on Saturday, but ultimately the freshman could still be in for another big night nonetheless.\n\nContact/Follow us @RollTideWire on X, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Alabama news, notes and opinion.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Roll Tide Wire: Alabama basketball bold predictions for game vs. Texas Longhorns",

The college student was found dead at the bottom of an apartment complex. The Austin Police Department suggested that Aguilera took her own life, though the cheerleader's mother strongly disagreed.\n\nStephanie Rodriguez, the mother of the deceased cheerleader, ripped Austin Police for their investigation.\n\n“Please don’t believe this lazy investigator and Investigation!” Stephanie Rodriguezwrote on Facebook.\n\nNow, the parents of the cheerleader have filed a $1 million lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed against Austin Blacks Rugby Club and the University of Texas’ Latin Economics and Business Association. The seven-figure lawsuit accuses the two school organizations of allegedly serving their daughter alcohol before her death.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Aguilera was served her first drink around 6 p.m. She was allegedly continued to be served drinks for several hours, before stumbling away. Aguilera ended up at an apartment where she was supposed to spend the night. Ultimately, she fell to her death around midnight.\n\n“We believe even more today this was not a suicide as has been suggested by police. This was either an accident or something much more sinister,” Tony Buzbee, lead attorney with the Buzbee Law Firm, who is representing Aguilera’s parents, said at a press conference.\n\nHe added: “If the police department will not do its job, then we will do it for them.\"\n\nThe police said that they found a deleted suicide note on Aguilera's phone. However, attorneys representing Aguilera's family say that it was just a drafted essay.\n\nAn official cause of death has yet to be released. An investigation into the death remains to be underway.",

    "fullText": "In what increasingly resembles NFL free agency, the transfer portal now commands more attention than National Signing Day or even the early signing period. Love it or hate it, it isn’t going anywhere—and every program in the country feels its impact.\n\nBut the portal also gives players the same flexibility coaches enjoy: the ability to leave when a better opportunity presents itself. On Thursday, former Texas A&M redshirt junior tight end Theo Melin Öhrström found exactly that, landing with an ACC‑bound program not too far from Aggieland.\n\nAccording to On3Sports’ Hayes Fawcett, Öhrström will join the SMU Mustangs for the 2026 season and is expected to arrive in Dallas with up to two years of eligibility remaining. The former four‑star prospect stayed through the coaching transition in College Station and continued to make steady progress, earning more snaps as his career unfolded. He was firmly in the mix to start for the Aggies in 2026, but ultimately opted for a fresh start.\n\nAt SMU, he’ll have a much clearer path as the main focus at the position and can serve as the veteran presence in a young tight end room next season.\n\nYou can see his announcement below.\n\nBREAKING: Texas A&M transfer TE Theo Melin Ohrstrom has Committed to SMU, he tells @On3Sports\n\nHe totaled 352 yards and 3 TDs in his time with the Aggieshttps://t.co/RlUbB6Fk7q pic.twitter.com/sYJsfYzlSk\n\n— Hayes Fawcett (@Hayesfawcett3) January 8, 2026\n\nThe NCAA football transfer portal opened Jan. 2 and runs through Jan. 16.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions.

    "description": "\"There’s a lot of story to be written.\"",
    "fullText": "A critically endangered large bird is getting a helping hand with the opening of a large sanctuary on the Gulf Coast.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that the Wolfberry Whooping Crane Sanctuary will provide a vital wintering ground for the 550 cranes that migrate each winter to Texas from Canada.\n\nThe $8.4 million land acquisition was a joint venture between different conservation groups. It marks a key next step in the crane's recovery from the brink of extinction in the 1940s.\n\nThe whooping crane's numbers dipped to just 21 individuals in the wild, 16 in Texas, because of extensive destruction of wetlands and illegal hunting.\n\nRising sea levels are further eroding the crane's breeding grounds. They were one of the first species listed under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.\n\nCarter Crouch, director of the Gulf Coast programs for the International Crane Foundation, hailed the progress made while acknowledging the challenges ahead:\n\n\"We have a long way to go still, so there's a lot of story to be written, and I'm super excited to be a small part of that.\"\n\nThe whooping crane is a striking bird that typically stands about five feet tall with white feathers and a distinctive red patch on its head. Its name reveals its other defining characteristic: very loud vocalizations.\n\nLike other cranes, they play an important role in maintaining the balance of the food web in wetlands by keeping prey populations under control and spreading nutrients. They are also considered an indicator species, meaning their presence is a sign of a healthy ecosystem.\n\nWhile still in a precarious state, they are resilient birds with a long lifespan, so there's good reason to be optimistic for their future.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nAnother promising note is another rare crane's remarkable comeback on the other side of the world. It shows what's possible with effective local and international cooperation to protect threatened species.\n\nSupporting such efforts with your time or money can make a huge difference.\n\nAn Instagram post from Saving Cranes (@savingcranes) about the story garnered several positive comments.\n\n\"Great win conserving one of the earth's great habitats for wildlife for future generations!\" read one.\n\nAnother happy commenter added, \"Bravo! Thank You!

    "fullText": "KeShawn Murphy thought he had hit a ridiculous deep buzzer-beater to lift Auburn past Texas A&M on Tuesday night.\n\nMurphy, with Auburn down by two points, caught an inbounds pass with just 0.6 seconds left on the clock, turned and fired. His shot was perfect, and sparked a massive celebration at Neville Arena. The shot looked like it was one of the first truly great buzzer-beaters of the college basketball season, several months before March even hit.\n\nBut unfortunately for Murphy and the Tigers, a review from the officials determined that the release was just a little too late. Murphy didn’t get the shot off in time, and the points were called off. That gave the Aggies the 90-88 road win, and left them celebrating in front of a stunned arena instead.\n\nWILD ENDING 🤯 \n\nThis supposed buzzer-beater from Auburn was overturned after review to give Texas A&M the win. pic.twitter.com/oxjZEHlWGH\n\n— SEC Network (@SECNetwork) January 7, 2026\n\n\"I don't have a clear understanding still,\" Auburn coach Steven Pearl said, via WSFA12's Rosie Langello-Hodgens. \"I still gotta gather more information and get an understanding as to what their determination was ... Just from the angles that I saw, it looked like the ball was out of his hands on the red light, on the scoreboard that we were looking at. But I would imagine that they had a different angle they were looking at to determine the ball wasn't out of his hands.\"\n\nPearl had a conversation with the SEC after the game, and he was seen meeting with athletic director John Cohen and officials on the court well after speaking with reporters.\n\nTexas A&M rallied from a 16-point hole to grab the win over the Tigers, which got them to 12-3 on the season and kept them a perfect 2-0 in SEC play. Pop Isaacs led the way with 21 points off the bench after he shot 7-of-12 from the field, and Jacari Lane added 17 points and seven rebounds. The Aggies have now won five straight entering Saturday's game with Oklahoma.\n\nKeyshawn Hall led Auburn with 32 points and 12 rebounds in the loss, and Kevin Overton finished with 16 points. Murphy had eight points and eight rebounds. The Tigers have now lost four of their last six, and fell to 9-6 on the season — which is the first under Pearl, who took over for his father, longtime coach Bruce Pearl, this past offseason. They’ll head into Saturday’s game with No. 15 Arkansas without an SEC win looking to avoid what would be the program’s first three-game losing skid since 2023.",

    "fullText": "Texas transfer redshirt freshman wide receiver Parker Livingstone has committed to rival Oklahoma, On3’s Hayes Fawcett and Pete Nakos report.\n\nLivingstone, who was a four-star recruit out of Lovejoy in the 2024 class, exploded onto the scene for the Longhorns in 2025. The Lucas, TX native hauled in 29 receptions for 516 yards and six touchdowns. He caught two passes for 29 yards in Texas’ 23-6 win over Oklahoma on Oct. 11.\n\nThe departure of Livingstone came as a big blow to Texas starting quarterback Arch Manning, who was Livingstone’s roommate in Austin. As news of his transfer emerged, Manning posted an Instagram story of him and Livingstone with a teary-eyed emoji.\n\nLivingstone now joins an Oklahoma program fresh off an appearance in the College Football Playoff. The Sooners went up 17-0 over Alabama in their First Round matchup, but were outscored 34-7 over the remainder of the game in a 34-24 loss.\n\nDespite the loss, head coach Brent Venables made it clear how proud he was of both the players returning next season and those moving on: “We couldn’t have done it if they didn’t stick with it, if they didn’t continue to believe when a lot of the things were going on around them,” Venables elaborated. “They could’ve bowed out, and they chose not to.”\n\nAlthough it appeared he could be one of the top quarterback prospects in the 2026 NFL Draft following a red-hot start to the season, quarterback John Mateer will likely return to Norman for his redshirt senior. season. In 12 games this season, Mateer completed 62.2% of passes for 2,885 yards and 14 touchdowns with 11 interceptions. He also totaled 431 yards and eight scores on the ground.\n\nMateer addressed his future immediately following the Sooners’ loss to the Crimson Tide. He was non-committal when discussing what’s next for his football career. “I haven’t really thought about it yet,” Mateer said. “I’m pretty sure I’ll take some time and weigh all the options and we’ll see.”\n\nESPN’s Kirk Herbstreit however implored Mateer to return to Norman next season. “Why would he leave a place that’s become home? I guess if someone paid him,” Herbstreit said. “My guess is, he’s going back to OU.”\n\nWith Mateer and Livingstone leading the OU offense, back-to-back College Football Playoff appearances are certainly the expectation for the Sooner faithful.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.\n\nThe On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M's offensive line will look very different in 2026, as head coach Mike Elko and O-line coach Adam Cushing will need to replace four starters, now including junior left guard Chase Bisontis, who has officially declared for the 2026 NFL Draft after three successful seasons in College Station.\n\nA New Jersey native, Bisontis chose the Aggies over Rutgers in the 2023 recruiting class, bringing elite size and versatility at 6'5\" and 315 pounds, and during his first season with the Aggies, Bisontis started at right tackle amid former head coach Jimbo Fisher's final season at the helm.\n\nAfter Fisher was dismissed, Mike Elko felt that Adam Cushing was the perfect choice to help Bisontis reach his full potential, slotting him at left guard, where he has dominated ever since. Logging 1,962 snaps in his Texas A&M career, including 795 snaps, all at left guard during the 2025 season. Bisontis's elite strength will quickly translate to the next level, knowing that NFL scouts see him as a \"plug-and-play\" option at left or right guard.\n\nPro Football Focus graded Bisontis as an above-average pass protector (70.7) and average run blocker (62.7). Still, these grades, compared to most SEC starting guards, prove the level of defensive competition within the conference.\n\nOver the last three days, Texas A&M landed commitments from LSU transfer guard Coen Echols and South Carolina guard Trovon Baugh, which now makes even more sense given today's news. Needing size and SEC experience at left and right guard is key to avoiding a substantial drop-off in the trenches, and credit to Mike Elko for preparing for the inevitable.\n\nTexas A&M OL Chase Bisontis has declared for the 2026 NFL Draft, per his Instagram (chase_bisontis) 👍 #GigEm @CBisontis pic.twitter.com/iQfPNJsSQI\n\n— Luke Evangelist (@lukeevangelist_) January 6, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M star OL Chase Bisontis has declared for the 2026 NFL Draft",

    "fullText": "Jan 6 (Reuters) - One of the first police officers on the scene of the 2022 attack at a Texas elementary school that killed 19 students and two ​teachers is now the first to stand trial, accused of failing to act ‌as the gunman continued one of the deadliest mass killings targeting students in U.S. history.\n\nOpening arguments were to begin ‌Tuesday in the trial of Adrian Gonzales, 52, who was a member of the school district police force. Hundreds of officers from local, state and federal agencies waited 77 minutes before entering a classroom where the gunman was holed up. Teachers and children made lengthy calls to 911 emergency ⁠services, saying they were in the ‌room with the gunman and surrounded by bodies.\n\nGonzales was charged in 2024 with 29 counts of child endangerment, according to his indictment, which said ‍that he \"failed to engage, distract, and delay the shooter\" and that he also failed \"to follow his active shooter training to respond to gun fire by advancing toward the gun fire.\"\n\nEach count carries the possibility of ​two years in prison. Gonzales has pleaded not guilty. Gonzales' attorney, Nico LaHood, has said ‌that his client showed up to help children, and that he did in fact help many evacuate.\n\nPedro \"Pete\" Arredondo, the former chief of the Uvalde schools police and the person who investigators say was the officer in charge of the scene, faces 10 counts of the same charge. His trial has not yet been scheduled.\n\nState and federal investigations into the shooting found that officers ⁠left the 18-year-old gunman alone inside the classroom with ​children while weighing how to confront him.\n\nDebates between proponents ⁠of gun control measures and defenders of the constitutional right to bear arms have resulted in few restrictions on firearms in the United States compared to other industrialized ⁠nations.\n\nFormer U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, in remarks made while presenting the federal report on Uvalde in 2024, said ‌that \"lives would have been saved\" had the police immediately confronted the gunman.",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M landed its seventh transfer addition since the portal opened on Monday afternoon, securing its second offensive line commitment, as South Carolina guard Trovon Baugh will head to College Station this spring, and I can safely say that this one came out of nowhere. After landing LSU guard and former Texas A&M commit Coen Echols, head coach Mike Elko has added more beef in the trenches.\n\nWith starting left tackle Trey Zuhn, right guard Ar'maj Reed-Adams, and right tackle Dametreous Crownover all departing for the NFL Draft, landing two experienced offensive linemen was crucial before entering the spring season, while left guard Chase Bisontis has yet to decide his playing future. For those who aren't familiar with Baugh, he started 11 of 12 games at right guard for the Gamecocks last season, logging 611 snaps, while his overall performance is a mixed bag with more positives than negatives.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Focus, Baugh earned average grades, but did finish the year with four 80-plus pass protection grades, and earned at least 50 or above grades as a run blocker, proving that there's still plenty of room for improvement. On paper, with Adams leaving, Baugh will likely compete with Coen Echols and sophomore guard Blake Ivy for the starting right guard spot.\n\nStanding at 6'3\" and 335 pounds, Baugh possesses NFL size and strength, but still needs to refine his technique to reach his full potential. Mike Elko has filled another gap in the roster.\n\nMore beef 🥩 \n\nWelcome to Aggieland, @BaughTrovon 👍 pic.twitter.com/To8BGNl1i2\n\n— TexAgs Recruiting (@TA_Recruiting) January 5, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M land commitment from South Carolina transfer OL Trovon Baugh",

    "description": "I followed a partner to Texas from California, then left both the state and relationship. I learned an important lesson about making my own decisions.",
    "fullText": "Shortly after earning my Bachelor's degree, I did what any confused 21-year-old would do: I moved to be with a partner.\n\nThe decision surprised a lot of people in my life. My dad raised his eyebrows at my choice to move for love and to make Texas my home.\n\nAfter all, I'd always dreamed of moving to New York, where I'd launch my writing career.\n\nHowever, moving to Texas seemed like a good option at the time. It's where my long-distance partner was living and working, and I was fresh out of college and eager to leave my California hometown.\n\nLooking back now, I was leaning on a romanticized version of what moving would mean — a fresh start and a deepening of our LDR — instead of thinking about what I really wanted.\n\nI arrived in northern Texas during a mid-summer nightmare of humidity. I couldn't walk outside without feeling like I'd just entered a sauna — a sharp contrast to California's dry heat.\n\nFrom the very beginning, I tried to find community and make living here work, convincing myself I'd adjust if I just put in enough effort.\n\nBut I had a tough time finding things to do in my new suburb. Quiet nights and weekends left me daydreaming about New York City and its seemingly endless array of activities and events even more.\n\nCrucially, I also found it incredibly difficult to meet anyone who felt similar to me.\n\nMy Dallas suburb felt much more conservative than my California hometown, and a lot of the people in our neighborhood were avid churchgoers, whereas I'm not religious.\n\nAround this time, too, I was coming to terms with the fact that I also liked women romantically. I struggled to find the kinds of queer spaces that seemed more plentiful in larger cities and bluer states.\n\nAs much as I tried to appreciate the mountainless views and endless selection of barbecue, I struggled to connect with my new town — and I couldn't stop thinking about the life I wanted in New York.\n\nSix months in, I took a quick trip back to California to visit my dad.\n\nTaking some time away from Texas made me confront the truth: I couldn't stay there anymore.\n\nThroughout my entire time in the state, I'd been daydreaming about packing up my things and living in New York City. My partner, on the other hand, wanted life in the country, and we just ended up not being compatible.\n\nThe Lone Star State helped bring all of these realizations to light.\n\nI knew that if I had chosen to stay, I'd continue to feel like a stranger in my own life. I realized that I'd rather take on the \"sunk cost\" of moving than stay in a place and relationship that didn't suit me.\n\nI learned a lot about myself during this time — including the fact that, maybe unsurprisingly, a suburb in northern Texas was not a great long-term fit for me. The biggest lesson I learned, though, was never to give up my own hopes and dreams for the sake of a relationship.\n\nDon't get me wrong: Moving for a partner can work for some people, but at 21, I learned the importance of making life decisions with my own wants and needs in mind.\n\nNow, almost a decade later, I'm writing this from my New York City apartment. I'm in a city where I've found my purpose, the love of my life, and most importantly, happiness.\n\nLeaving Texas turned out to be one of the best decisions I've ever made.",

    "description": "Indiana embarrassed Alabama and Oregon shut out Texas Tech. The Big Ten showed it has the best teams in CFB and is guaranteed to play for the title",
    "fullText": "It was a great week for the Big Ten The national championship game is guaranteed to have a team that resides in the Big Ten Conference. The title game won't feature two Big Ten teams, but there is no doubt that the best game in this playoff and the best game this season might be the upcoming semifinal between two Big Ten teams, Indiana and Oregon.\n\nHere are my takeaways from the Big Ten from this Week's bowl games:\n\nFrom wins like Iowa over Vandy, Illinois over Tennessee, a high-powered offense, all the way to Indiana beating Alabama, the Big Ten showcased they are the best conference in the country. The Big Ten lost Ohio State as a representative, but with the matchup between Oregon and Indiana, that could very well be the team that wins it all. Indiana very well looks like the best team remaining by a wide margin. Texas did get the best of Michigan, but everyone is clearly aware of what has been going on in Michigan prior to that bowl game. It is safe to say that the Big Ten runs college football.\n\nAgainst Alabama, Fernando Mendoza was as good as he could possibly be. Mendoza was 14-16, threw for 192 yards through the air, and threw for 3 passing touchdowns. Many of his other counterparts struggled, while Mendoza continues to win and continues to be the reason why Indiana is winning. At this current moment, Mendoza looks like a sure thing quarterback prospect for the next draft class, and he will make one desperate NFL team very happy.\n\nIndiana was the one team that had a bye week in the College Football Playoff that did not lose. Not only did they not lose to Alabama, but they won the game in the first half. Ty Simpson had no chance, and this was a complete football performance by Indiana and Curt Cignetti. The Hoosiers are undefeated this year, and last season they only lost two games, one of which was in last season's College Football Playoff. Cignetti consistently has this team ready to dominate regardless of the opponent. He has a Big Ten title for the first time in program history, and he is looking for much more this season. This two-year run for Cignetti in Indiana places him as the best coach in college football right now, and it is not close, just like the coaching match between him and Kalen DeBoer on Thursday.\n\nIndiana is a team that has not shown any weakness this season. In games that could have resulted in an upset this season, Indiana has a guy who can win them games in the clutch in Fernando Mendoza. This team has an elite quarterback, they have elite weapons as Omar Cooper Jr. returned versus Alabama, and their defense is just as good as any team left. This team is well coached, and their team is full of players at every level who have been in college football for at least 4 years. The steamrolling of Alabama was a surprise to no one. Indiana made their statement on Thursday and proved it is the team to beat.\n\nThe last time these two teams met, Indiana won 30-20. That game was a battle, and both quarterbacks struggled and faced adversity. Mendoza proved to be the quarterback who battled adversity the best. Against Indiana was the first time Dante Moore struggled and did not have his usual success. For Oregon to win, they will need Dante Moore to be the better quarterback. In all the other areas on their team, Oregon matches up very well against Indiana, and their defense showed that by completely shutting out Texas Tech. Once again, these two teams will deliver one of the best games of this season. In my opinion, whoever wins this game will win the whole thing.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: Big Ten football teams handled the SEC in New Year's bowl games",

The Aggies' high-paced attack outscored the Tigers, 18-7, in fast-break points.\n\nTigers met Bucky Ball 👍#GigEm | @optimum pic.twitter.com/PXEW1Kz40P\n\n— Texas A&M Basketball (@aggiembk) January 3, 2026\n\nMcMillan has his team out to a four-game winning streak and a 1-0 record to begin SEC play. While the Aggies must continue to improve from range, as the team shot just 28.6% from beyond the arc in the win, there are a plethora of exhilarating playmakers in Bryan-College Station, Texas, who want to turn the program around this season. Texas A&M moved to 11-3 with the first victory of the new year, but league play presents more difficult challenges ahead, including games against six teams currently ranked in the top 25.\n\nThe Aggies' next SEC contest takes place on Tuesday, Jan. 6, as McMillan's squad faces the Auburn Tigers at Neville Arena in Auburn, Alabama. Tip-off against the Tigers is set for 8 p.m. CT and will be broadcast live on the SEC Network.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Dylan on X: @dylanmflippo.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M MBK secures 75-72 victory over LSU in SEC opener",

Gideon, a four-year safety at Texas, played for Muschamp in Austin. He was the safeties coach for Steve Sarkisian until 2025, when he left for Atlanta.\n\nAfter running the defense for the Yellow Jackets this season, Gideon is returning to his alma mater. The 36-year-old played safety at Texas from 2008 through 2011. He got his first coaching role in 2014 and has climbed the career ladder for 11 years. Gideon served as the Longhorns’ safety coach for four seasons before accepting his first defensive coordinator position with Georgia Tech. Georgia Tech ended the season the 99th-ranked defense in FBS.\n\nIn December, Texas coach Steve Sarkisian parted ways with Pete Kwiatkowski and replaced him with Muschamp.

His defenses are relentless; he absolutely gets the best out of his staff and players and is such an extremely well-respected coach.

Things became worrisome defensively when Tech allowed 48 points to NC State, ending Tech’s undefeated run at 8-0, and then followed it up by allowing 34 points to 1-win Boston College, then going down 28-0 to Pitt in just over a quarter of play.\n\nOn the plus side, Tech’s defense did hold georgia to only 16 points.\n\nWith Gideon’s departure, the Jackets currently have vancancies in both offensive and defensive coordinator. Former OC Buster Faulkner left to become Florida’s OC under John Sumrall before the Pop-Tarts Bowl.

    "fullText": "Texas ‘confident’ in landing $1.8 million transfer weapon for Arch Manning originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe old saying still applies: Everything is bigger in the state of Texas — including the NIL budget for the Texas Longhorns.\n\nTexas hasn’t exactly been shy about its spending over the past few years in its pursuit of the program’s first national championship since 2005. Even back in 2024, Lamborghini Austin — one of the Longhorns’ most visible NIL supporters — lined up luxury vehicles to help entice incoming recruits.\n\nThe dealership has previously signed former Texas stars Bijan Robinson and Jordan Whittington. Now, it appears Lamborghini Austin could be involved again as the Longhorns pursue one of the top players in the transfer portal: former Auburn wide receiver Cam Coleman.\n\nAs of January 2, Coleman is visiting Austin, and Texas is feeling optimistic about its chances.\n\n“Texas’ confidence is high that they can land the talented pass catcher,” On3’s Pete Nakos reported.\n\nLanding Coleman, who has a reported NIL value of $1.8 million, would be a major addition for the Longhorns, who are looking to surround quarterback Arch Manning with as much offensive firepower as possible heading into next season.\n\nHowever, Texas won’t have a clear path to securing his commitment.\n\nUnless Texas is able to close the deal during his visit, Coleman plans to take additional trips, according to ESPN’s Pete Thamel. After leaving Austin, he is expected to visit Texas A&M, Texas Tech, Alabama and USC.\n\nThose programs are all capable of competing in the NIL space, but Texas may still hold a significant advantage. The Longhorns’ 2025 roster was reportedly built with an NIL budget in the $35–40 million range. Unless that number shifts following Texas’ playoff miss this season, it will be difficult for most schools to outbid them.\n\nFor now, Coleman’s visit represents another example of how Texas continues to leverage its financial muscle in the transfer portal — and why landing elite talent in Austin often comes down to whether anyone else can realistically keep pace.",

    "fullText": "The transfer portal is open, and Texas A&M head coach Mike Elko will have plenty to consider on both sides of the ball, which will include adding another wide receiver after KC Concepcion announced his intention to enter the 2026 NFL Draft, a decision that was not surprising given his elite performance during the 2025 season.\n\nWhile Concepcion's playmaking ability will be missed, the Aggies need to find a true X receiver with the height, length, and catch radius to shore up the red zone offense, allowing starting quarterback Marcel Reed to continue improving as a pocket passer, and provide more confidence with another playmaker to utilize through the air.\n\nThis week, the news that Auburn star wide receiver Cam Coleman planned to enter the transfer portal was shocking to say the least. While the Aggies have been directly connected to the standout pass catcher, several intriguing names have entered the portal, including Texas wide receiver Parker Livingstone and Rutgers wideout Ian Strong, who both fit that X receiver mold.\n\nLivingstone's departure was surprising after finishing his redshirt freshman season with 516 yards and six receiving touchdowns. At the same time, his close friendship with starting quarterback Arch Manning helped create one of the better connections. Does this mean the Longhorns are freeing up space to pursue Cam Coleman? Possibly, but nothing has been reported.\n\nIan Strong is another solid option, standing at 6'3\", and totaled 95 receptions for 1,438 yards and 10 touchdowns during his last two seasons at Rutgers. Aggie fans will remember wide receiver Caleb Chapman, who, despite his injury issues, was one of the more reliable deep threats because of his stature and long-strider speed, which has been missing from the A&M passing attack since Noah Thomas transferred to Georgia.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M has two more intriguing transfer wide receivers to consider",

    "description": "How Joey McGuire won over Texas Tech with bold outreach and a seven-step plan to jump-start winning as the program's next head coach.",
    "fullText": "Experience isn't everything when it comes to hiring. Just look at Joey McGuire, the head football coach at Texas Tech University.\n\nWhen the Red Raiders began their head-coaching search in 2021, McGuire didn't have as stacked a résumé as his competition. As ESPN reported, he was \"a true underdog candidate.\"\n\nAt the time, McGuire had spent the majority of his coaching career at Cedar Hill High School in Texas, where he had notched three state championships. He also spent a few years as an assistant coach at Baylor.\n\nOn paper, it was the kind of background that would have given many Power 4 programs pause.\n\nTexas Tech's hiring committee may have completely overlooked McGuire had he not reached out himself. According to ESPN, he cold-called athletic director Kirby Hocutt, left a voicemail, and asked for the opportunity to interview.\n\nThat kind of bold outreach can be a differentiator.\n\n\"I always advise not to be too afraid of cold outreach,\" a former Google recruiter told Business Insider in 2023. \"If you're really interested in a company, get in touch with those you want to work with — email the CEO, the head of talent, or the hiring manager and let them know why you're the right person for the job.\"\n\nOnce McGuire got in the room, he made the most of it.\n\nESPN reported that he showed up to the interview with unmatched enthusiasm and \"a seven-step plan for winning.\" The publication said he had with him \"the full list of coaches he would like to hire. He had a detailed plan for fixing in-state recruiting and spoke of waking a sleeping giant.\"\n\nThe preparation left a lasting impression.\n\n\"We were all like, 'We found our guy,'\" Tony Hernandez, a former deputy athletic director and member of the search committee, told ESPN after the meeting.\n\nTexas Tech ultimately decided to go with McGuire, and the gamble has paid off.\n\nWhile the Red Raiders fell to Oregon in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals on Thursday, under McGuire, the team has surged from relative obscurity to a program-record 12 wins in 2025. They also secured their first outright conference championship since 1955 when they toppled BYU last month.\n\nMcGuire's story is a good reminder that a little preparation can go a long way, no matter what type of job you're applying for.\n\nAs business etiquette expert Jacqueline Whitmore told BI, \"Most people don't do the proper research about the company. We have so many resources to use, including LinkedIn, websites, and social media. There's no excuse for you to go into an interview and not know about the company and something about who might be interviewing you.\"",

    "fullText": "PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — No. 1 Indiana became the first team in the brief history of the 12-team College Football Playoff to win a game after receiving a first-round bye, smothering Alabama 38-3 in a quarterfinal at the Rose Bowl on Thursday.\n\nThe Hoosiers (14-0; No. 1 AP, No. 1 CFP) ended a six-game losing streak for teams coming off an extended layoff, including second seed Ohio State falling to Miami in the Cotton Bowl on Wednesday and fourth seed Texas Tech being shutout by Oregon in the Orange Bowl earlier on Thursday.\n\nAn inauspicious start made it seem as if Indiana might continue the trend of teams unable to respond after a long layoff, going three-and-out on the opening possession with Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza taking two sacks. The Crimson Tide (11-4; No. 11 AP, No. 9 CFP) then found early success with two quick first downs into Hoosiers’ territory before the defense stepped up to force a punt.\n\nFrom there, Indiana came to life, taking a 17-0 halftime lead on a 31-yard field goal by Nicolas Radicic and two touchdown passes from Mendoza. Avoiding an early deficit was crucial, as it had been something of a constant in the previous losses by idle teams.\n\nThe Buckeyes found themselves in a 14-0 hole at the break against the Hurricanes, and the Red Raiders allowed 104 yards to the Ducks while gaining minus-2 yards in the first quarter. In last year's Granddaddy of Them All, Oregon gave up the first 34 points in a 41-21 loss to eventual national champion Ohio State.\n\nNot spotting Alabama an early advantage allowed Indiana to continue playing to its strengths and eventually wear down the SEC at-large participant.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "description": "Oregon Ducks head coach Dan Lanning met with media members to break down his team's win over the Texas Tech Red Raiders in the CFP Quarterfinals.",
    "fullText": "It may have taken an entire calendar year, but the Oregon Ducks finally exorcised their demons from last year with a win in the College Football Playoff Quarterfinals. They manhandled the Texas Tech Red Raiders in a 23-0 shutout, where the Big-12 champions’ top-10 offense was dismantled.\n\nDan Lanning was visibly frustrated with his team’s defense after their win in the first round of the playoffs, so it makes sense why the unit put together such an inspired performance. The same couldn’t be said for the offense, who only had 16 points total before a garbage-time touchdown inflated the stats slightly.\n\nWhile there are still things to improve upon, it should make the Ducks feel good that they can be so dominant while playing far below their potential. They are just two wins away from being immortalized as champions. Let’s look at what Lanning had to say about that prospect and the win today over Texas Tech.\n\nLanning: Unbelievable game. A lot of fun. We've talked to our guys about being battle tested all year and having to win in different ways. That game went back and forth in a lot of ways, struggled at times to go score points, and our defense did an unbelievable job getting the ball back. And then our offense showed up when it mattered most at the end of the game. I think we out-physicaled our opponent at the end. A lot of respect for Coach McGuire and the team that he's had. This shouldn't discredit them. I remember this feeling last year when you have a really good team, you play really good football all year, and then it comes to an end. And that's the way it is for every team but one. Certainly grateful for our fans and excited to see them show up in Atlanta.\n\nQ: What did you make of the hype surrounding Texas Tech’s defense before this game?\n\nLanning: Yeah, we thought they were. They are a good defense. Their performance today, I think it showed it. You walk into halftime, it's 6-0, that's a great indicator of them being a good defense. And they had some guys that played some really good ball. We just felt like in this moment it was going to be about chipping away and eventually it was going to break. It kind of broke open with us creating some extra opportunities there with takeaways, opportunities on special teams. I thought our special teams played really, really well.\n\nBut we had a lot of respect for Texas Tech's defense. They don't play the way they've played all year and not be good. And they are. They're good. We thought it would be about explosive plays. There weren't a ton of explosive plays in this game really for either side. But the physicality showed up for our guys down the stretch.\n\nQ: How were you able to shut down the Red Raiders’ passing attack?\n\nLanning: Definitely it starts with players like Brandon. I think Brandon would tell you the same thing. It's about 11 guys executing, and that's how you get an opportunity to create plays like that. I think when we pull up this film and we watch it, we're going to see 11 guys playing the same call. We knew their tempo would be an issue. So ultimately we wanted to be able to get the call in fast and let our guys line up. I thought we did a really good job of that.\n\nI thought Coach Lupoi did a great job of calling the game, and our defensive coaches preparing them. I felt like it was probably faster in practice than it was in the game, which is ultimately what we wanted. And then we knew their strengths. They've been really good at completing shots down the field. They've had a really good screen game. Those are things that we really prepared for and worked really hard for, and guys like Brandon showed up.\n\nQ: Can you speak about your mindset on going for it in fourth down?\n\nLanning: Well, it worked sometimes and didn't work sometimes. So I assume all the times it didn't work I'm stupid and all the times it worked I'm smart. That's kind of how it works. I feel like -- we talked about it at halftime. We made some adjustments. They were playing really good 4th down defense, and we decided, hey, let's take the points in the second half. But I think that's our mindset. We make those decisions early in the week, and I certainly trust our offense. They ran a really tough defensive call for what we called down there in the red area. That's one that you wish you had back, say we could have took the points there. But points are never guaranteed. We missed a field goal, too.\n\nBut I felt good about -- we had an early look on punt and felt like we were going to have a look at the punt fake. That was an opportunity to go be aggressive. And just felt like ultimately, if you limit the opportunities for their offense to be on the field, you were going to increase the opportunities for us to go score and them not to, and that showed up today.\n\nQ: What is the challenges of defending a player like David Bailey?\n\nLanning: They've got good players, man. They've got really good players. They've got a great front. Ultimately they rushed the passer really, really well. I'm excited to evaluate the film and say how can we shore that up. I think there's going to be some small things that we can attack and make better. There's some plays we were really efficient at today, and then there were some plays that weren't. When you have a player like David Bailey, when you have players that you're going to see in the College Football Playoff, you've got to have a plan for them. At times our plan was really good, and then there was some times that we could certainly improve that.\n\nQ: Can you speak about Brandon Finney Jr.’s interception in the end zone?\n\nLanning: It's a strategic play. He did it exactly like we asked him to do. We tell him to play low to high down in the red area. He did exactly that. He played low until the player was able to show up and take away the low and then he creeped to high, and he made an outstanding play. I was just as impressed with the fact took a knee after he caught it.\n\nQ: What are your thoughts on not having a first-round bye?\n\nLanning: I guess it works, right? I've been a proponent for games to be happening much quicker for a long time. I think that's best for college football. Again, I felt like this game -- the Orange Bowl, first off, was unbelievable. I should have really given kudos to the Orange Bowl because it's been a great experience, but it's not the same bowl experience anymore when you talk about playoffs. Our guys didn't leave the hotel. They had a mindset that we can celebrate when this thing is all over with and they were really focused, but the hospitality here was unbelievable.\n\nBut we're trying to serve two different purposes here, and this is a playoff. A playoff in my opinion should have been played in Lubbock, Texas. I've said that before. That's not because we wanted to go play in Lubbock; I certainly didn't. I'm glad we played here in Miami, and it was good prep for us, but last year very similar situation for us. I feel like that game should have been played in Eugene. There's a lot of people that do playoffs. I feel like the playoffs have looked a certain way for a long time, and we're trying to serve two purposes here. The amount of time in between games, obviously, is tough for teams. We experienced it last year.\n\nQ: What will the next 24 hours look like for your team after this win?\n\nLanning: Well, it's going to start with about a five-hour flight, five-and-a-half-hour flight, but we'll be watching film on the way back, start trying to evaluate the opponents that we could potentially play. Hopefully we get some wi-fi up there in the air and we can flip on a game and check it out. But it always starts with us. That's where we're going to go back and look at this game and say, okay, what did we do really well. Let's go to the doctor, let's figure out what kind of medicine we've got to take for the next game because I think that's always the greatest indicator of what you have to improve, when you start to analyze what you have in front of you. Then we'll have kind of a bonus day here tomorrow and then we'll hop right into a normal week prep, Sunday prep. I don't even know what day today is. Today is Saturday in my mind. But we'll get a bonus day, and then it'll be Sunday the next day.\n\nContact/Follow @Ducks_Wire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oregon Ducks news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ducks Wire: Top quotes from Dan Lanning after CFP win vs. Texas Tech Red Raiders",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOregon vs. Texas Tech highlights\n\nWhere to watch Oregon vs. Texas Tech\n\nCollege Football Playoff schedule\n\nThis year's College Football Playoff Orange Bowl game should be a great one, between the No. 5 Oregon Ducks and the No. 4 Texas Tech Red Raiders.\n\nTexas Tech earned the first-round bye after finishing 12-1 on the season as Big 12 champions. Oregon, meanwhile, took care of James Madison 51-34 at home in the first round.\n\nBoth of these teams have high-powered offenses. Oregon quarterback Dante Moore has the Ducks humming, averaging 39.2 points per game, good for ninth nationally. Tech's offense is equally explosive and has the nation's No. 2 scoring offense, led by signal-caller Behren Morton.\n\nThis game could come down to whichever defense gets off the field quicker. Both teams are also quite solid. Texas Tech allows just 254.4 yards per game, ranking third nationally in total defense. Oregon, meanwhile, gives up 271.4 per game. Another big factor to keep an eye on this one is turnovers. Texas Tech's defense has forced 31 turnovers this year, which leads the FBS. In Oregon's lone 30-20 loss to Indiana earlier this season, the Ducks had two turnovers.\n\nOregon is looking to prove it's a legitimate playoff contender, despite getting embarrassed in last year's quarterfinal round against Ohio State. Texas Tech, meanwhile, is on the CFP for the first time in school history, and looking to show it's right where it's supposed to be.\n\nWe should be in for a great one in Miami, Fla.

    "description": "Our free college football picks expect Texas State to flaunt their class vs. Rice in the Armed Forces Bowl. Free Rice vs. Texas State predictions for January 2, 2026.",
    "fullText": "The last day of bowl season kicks off on Tuesday morning in Fort Worth, TX, as the Rice Owls face the Texas State Bobcats in the Armed Forces Bowl at Amon G. Carter Stadium.\n\nRice is one of three 5-7 teams featuring in a bowl game, and my Rice vs. Texas State predictions believe the Owls are up against it, facing a quality Texas State team that is better than its 6-6 record indicates.\n\nRead on for my college football picks for Friday, January 2.\n\nTexas State will win this game and move to 7-6. The Bobcats suffered many close and heartbreaking defeats this season, but they’re still a solid team headed in the right direction under G.J. Kinne. This isn’t the kind of squad that has any business flirting with a losing record, whereas Rice is guaranteed to finish below .500.\n\nThe Rice Owls arrive in bowl season thanks to their APR Score and not anything that they’ve done on the football field. They clawed their way to five wins, but Scott Abell’s squad still has a lot of work to do before it can be considered a quality football team.\n\nThe Texas State Bobcats, on the other hand, have much more impressive metrics than you’d expect from a 6-6 team playing in the Group of 5.\n\nThe offense ranks Top 10 in EPA per play, led by star quarterback Brad Jackson (3,742 total yards, 34 TDs), workhorse running back Lincoln Pare (1,328 scrimmage yards, 13 TDs), and star receivers Beau Sparks and Chris Dawn Jr. (combined 2,044 yards, 11 TDs) behind a quality offensive line.\n\nThat potent unit will be close to full strength for this bowl game with no announced opt-outs as of December 31. They should exploit a beatable Rice defense that allowed more explosive plays than any other team in the country and checks in at 118th in EPA per play.\n\nOn the flip side, Rice will be without starting quarterback Chase Jenkins, and perhaps two of its top skill position players (wideout Drayden Dickmann and running back Daelen Alexander).\n\nThis unit was already bad (114th in success rate) and wants to keep the ball on the ground (fourth in rush rate), which might prove difficult against a Texas State defense ranking 55th in rush defense grade per PFF.\n\nThis is one of the highest totals we’ve seen in a Rice game all season, so my natural inclination is to bite the bullet and play the Under. The Owls play at a very slow pace (118th in snaps per minute) and simply aren’t built to play from behind or get into a shootout, which the game script calls for.\n\nThe defense will give up plenty, but that probably happens early in the ball game. Kinne will simply want to get his team out of Fort Worth with a victory, and can likely do so by a sizable margin even if he has his team cool the jets in the second half.\n\nSpread: Rice +14.5 | Texas State -14.5\n\nMoneyline: Rice +560 | Texas State -800\n\nOver/Under: Over 56.5 | Under 56.5\n\nRice is 2-5 ATS in its last seven games.

    "fullText": "EL PASO, Texas (KTSM) — An act of kindness took an unfortunate turn when an alleged homeless man was seen getting arrested earlier this week as he became aggressive at the entrance of a barber shop in El Paso’s Upper Valley, just moments after he was given money, a free haircut, snacks, and water.\n\nA video posted online by a local barber went viral, showing how he arrives at the barber shop, where a man is already sitting at the entrance. The barber greets the man and hands him money before asking if he wants some potato chips or water, to which the man says yes.\n\nOnce inside the shop, the barber can be seen grabbing at least three bags of potato chips and giving them to the man. They exchange a few words, and the barber offers the man a haircut, and he agrees. The video then shows the barber giving the man a haircut, and once he’s done, he’s seen walking the man to the door, saying, “Alright, man. Take care of yourself. I love you, brother. God bless you.”\n\nThe video cuts, and the barber is now seen inside the shop with the doors locked as the man is outside knocking on the door aggressively and shouting. The barber can be heard telling the man that he just gave him a haircut and that he is ungrateful.\n\nMoments later, El Paso police officers arrive outside the business where they are recorded confronting the man outside the shop. The incident escalates, and two officers are seen pinning the man down, and one of them appears to have shocked the man with a stun gun.\n\nKTSM 9 News reached out to the El Paso Police Department \n\nThe barber, who did not want to be identified by name and goes by z_cutzzz on social media, has previously shared similar acts of kindness online. His accounts feature barber content, lifestyle posts, and recurring messages encouraging people to be kind to one another.\n\nWhen KTSM 9 News asked “z_cutzzz” how he felt about the way the incident turned out, he said, “I can’t control the outcome of every situation but just keep my head up and know that it’s all for the glory of God so I can’t lose.”",

    "fullText": "Authorities in Texas searching for a woman who vanished on Christmas Eve found a body and a gun in a field near her home, officials said Tuesday.\n\nIt isn’t clear whether the person is Camila Mendoza Olmos, 19, Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar told reporters.\n\nHe added that although the medical examiner has not determined a cause and manner of death, authorities do not suspect foul play and the person may have died from self-harm.\n\n\"We hope that we can try to expedite that process to be able to get the community answers that everybody’s been waiting for,\" Salazar said.\n\nTexas discontinued its clear alert for Olmos on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe body was found in a field roughly 100 yards from Olmos’ home, which authorities had previously searched, Salazar said.\n\nSalazar said that because of tall brush — and with the help of a “small army” of FBI agents — they decided to search the area again Tuesday.\n\nThe body was found roughly 10 minutes after the search began, he said. The gun was found nearby, he added.\n\nOlmos was last seen on the morning of Dec. 24 leaving her home in northwest Bexar County. Olmos’ mother told NBC News that her daughter typically went for morning walks but didn’t return on Dec. 24.\n\nIf you or someone you know is in crisis, call or text 988 or go to 988lifeline.org to reach the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.

    "fullText": "The Oregon Ducks have been waiting for this moment for exactly one year.\n\nThe last time the calendar switched over to a new year, the Ducks went to the Rose Bowl, where Ohio State swiftly bounced them out of the College Football Playoff. Although the opponent and site are different, Dan Lanning's crew is looking for some redemption.\n\nThis time, it will be Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl for Oregon in the quarterfinals of this postseason. Should they win, the Ducks will go on to the Peach Bowl in Atlanta to face either Alabama and their old nemesis Kalen DeBoer or Indiana, the team that handed Oregon its only loss this year.\n\nThe Red Raiders aren't a pushover, however, and the Ducks will have to play well in order to move on. Texas Tech is 12-1 and is the Big XII champion. They have a formidable offense and defense. All 12 of their victories have been over a 20-point margin. Playing in a close game or from behind isn't their forte. The Ducks are hoping to do just that and are counting on their past success in the Big Ten to carry them through on New Year's Day.\n\nIt's been almost two weeks since Oregon defeated James Madison 51-34 and are even more healthy going into this game with Texas Tech. But receiver Evan Stewart, who has been out all year and speculated to be available for this game, has been listed as out. Other than that, the Duck offense should be running on full cylinders against a very good Red Raider defense.\n\nOregon vs. Texas Tech will be broadcast nationally on ESPN in the Orange Bowl and the quarterfinals of the College Football Playoff, with the winner moving on to play either Alabama or Indiana in the Peach Bowl in Atlanta Jan. 9. The game will feature play-by-play announcer Joe Tessitore and analyst Jesse Palmer, along with sideline reporters Katie George and Stormy Buonantony. Fans can stream on ESPN+.\n\nLocation: Hard Rock Stadium, Miami Gardens, FL.\n\nThe Oregon Ducks vs. Texas Tech Red Raiders game starts at 9:00 a.m. PST on Jan. 1, 2026, in Miami Gardens, FL.\n\nOdds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook as of Wednesday, Dec. 31\n\nMoneyline: Oregon -134, Texas Tech +114\n\nContact/Follow @Ducks_Wire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oregon Ducks news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ducks Wire: How to watch Oregon vs Texas Tech, streaming and betting info",

    "fullText": "Ahead of this Saturday's Under Armour All-American Game, which will feature more than half of the Aggies' 2027 recruiting class commits, the check-in portion, which took place on Tuesday afternoon, provided recruiting insiders plenty of insight regarding several elite recruits who have yet to commit to a program and are being connected to Texas A&M.\n\nProspects are taking notice after watching former Bowling Green edge Cashius Howell become an unanimous All-American during his final season with the Aggies, proving that head coach Mike Elko and his defensive staff, now including new co-defensive coordinator and defensive line coach Elijah Robinson, are on the right track.\n\nFor the No. 8-ranked prospect in the 2027 cycle, five-star edge Zyron Forstall, who will play in Saturday's game, revealed to Rivals insider Steve Wiltfong that the Aggies are \"probably sitting at the top right now\" of his recruitment list, which further proves that Robinson's hire, paired with Cashius Howell's acendance, has made the Aggies a top destination.\n\nForstall visited Texas A&M back on October 4. While the Aggies failed to take advantage of playing in Kyle Field during the first round of the College Football Playoff, falling 10-3 to Miami, Mike Elko's defense will continue to improve with better talent.\n\n“Really just the communication and how they showed interest and how consistent they’ve been reaching out and trying to get me out as much as possible.”\n\n“Really I’d say going back to watching their defense play this year and them telling me a position I can play. They have a guy on the field showing this is what you’re going to do and we’re going to develop you.”\n\nElko and his staff reportedly see Forstall as a Cashius Howell clone, which is quite the compliment, and given his five-star status, Forstall is ahead of schedule.\n\nAccording to Rivals, Forstall is currently positioned as the 9th-ranked prospect in the 2027 class, the No. 1-ranked Edge, and the 2nd-ranked prospect in Florida.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M is 'sitting at the top' of 2027 5-star Zyron Forstall's list",

    "fullText": "Biff Poggi defends Kyle Whittingham in key clarification of Michigan's program direction originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines are in a transition period regarding their football program. A 41-27 loss in the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl against the Texas Longhorns in Orlando marked the end of an era.\n\nMore specifically, the end of the Biff Poggi era. But, Poggi didn't want reporters to forget Wednesday what he meant to the program.\n\n“This isn’t a rebuild at all,” Poggi said of Michigan. \"That would shortchange the kids, and coach [Kyle] Whittingham is going to do an amazing job.”\n\nDespite Poggi's optimism about the program, he said he won't be part of it moving forward.\n\n\"What was my message to the team?\" Poggi said alongside linebacker Jimmy Rolder.\n\n\"Well, it is my last game at Michigan, and my message to the team after the game, what was my message to the team after the game? Do you remember?\"\n\nRolder, only a freshman, responded with a smile.\n\n\"Coach Biff has done so much for us, not even in just the football space, but just overall life advice,\" Rolder said. \"Everyone on the team looks up to him. Respects him so much. It sucks we weren’t able to go out there and win for him, because that is what everyone wanted to do. He was just telling us he was proud of us, thankful for the opportunity, and yeah.\"\n\nPoggi said Whittingham should be allowed and will center his focus on football with all the fallout from the Sherrone Moore situation in the past.\n\n\"Again, he is a guy that has won 180 games,\" Poggi said. \"He has been a head coach 20 years. He has won three conference championships, one in the WAC and two in the Big 12. I think he is going to find it very, very full covered, a bunch of very willing kids that are just great kids. People talk about Michigan and what it means to be a Michigan Man. I have a son that is a Michigan Man. I am not a Michigan Man. I didn’t go there, but these kids here are the definition of that, and I think he is going to love that.\"\n\nUltimately, Poggi wants his lasting image to be that he was grateful to lead the Wolverines for a short period.\n\n\"I have been a head coach in over 300 football games at all levels,\" Poggi said. \"There is not a team I have ever been prouder of than this team. I mean, these guys are unbelievable, and they are great human beings. At Michigan, you have to be a great student. There are very high standards on how to conduct themselves. It is truly the full package.\"\n\nNow that the season has ended, the Whittingham era has begun.",

    "title": "4 takeaways from Michigan’s Citrus Bowl loss vs Texas",
    "description": "A putrid defensive effort. A game featuring costly turnovers from Bryce Underwood. Here are takeaways from Michigan’s loss to Texas.",
    "fullText": "The Michigan Wolverines lost to Texas 41-27 in the Citrus Bowl, finishing the season 9-4.\n\nHere are key takeaways from Michigan’s loss to Texas.\n\nHeading into the fourth quarter, Michigan quarterback Bryce Underwood was 15-of-28 for 126 yards with two passing touchdowns. However, the wheels came off in the fourth quarter, and Underwood had two brutal interceptions thrown right to Texas defenders. Michigan was trailing just 24-20 heading into the final frame, but Underwood’s interceptions were extremely costly and careless. Underwood finished the day 23-of-42 for 199 yards with two touchdowns, three interceptions, along with 77 rushing yards and a score. Underwood’s just 18 and ups and downs during a true freshman campaign are to be expected. What’s troubling is how bad the interceptions were and how he played against the toughest teams on Michigan’s schedule.\n\nThe hope will be that Underwood has a better sophomore campaign with Kyle Whittingham as head coach, as Sherrone Moore didn’t exactly set him up for success this year. Even so, his interceptions in the Citrus Bowl were on him and must get cleaned up moving forward, otherwise Michigan will not be beating Ohio State or making a legitimate run at the College Football Playoff. Granted, Underwood’s ceiling is high, and he made many wow plays throughout 2025, but question marks still remain, and it’s not a sure thing that he develops into a superstar. At the very least, his showing in the Citrus Bowl was a discouraging effort heading into the offseason.\n\nMichigan defensive coordinator Wink Martindale almost certainly coached his last game at Michigan, and it couldn’t have gone much worse. Michigan had numerous missed tackles, they didn’t generate a sack despite blitzing a lot, they had blown coverages, and they allowed Arch Manning to gash them with his arm and legs. Manning was 21-of-34 for 221 yards with two touchdowns. Manning also embarrassed the Michigan defense as a runner with 155 yards, two touchdowns, including a 60-yard score to put Texas up 38-27. Michigan’s defense was bad against USC, Ohio State, and Texas, and a change in scheme and leadership is desperately needed on that side of the ball.\n\nWhile Michigan players didn’t execute at a high clip in the Citrus Bowl and the coaches didn’t call a good enough game to get a W, it’s Sherrone Moore’s fault that the game was so messy to begin with. Most criticism should be directed at Moore, not interim head coach Biff Poggi, the staff, or the players.\n\nThe 2025 season is now over and will be one that marks the end of an era and the beginning of a new one with head coach Kyle Whittingham. With Whittingham in charge, there’s actually light at the end of the tunnel; there’s hope that this program can get back on track. Even before details of Moore’s scandal emerged, it was becoming increasingly clear that Moore and his staff weren’t of the caliber that competes for championships. With Whittingham, the hope of a College Football Playoff berth feels a lot more attainable.\n\nWhile Michigan’s loss to Texas was an ugly way to finish the year, the good news is the season is finally over, and the program can move forward in a more cohesive and successful direction.\n\nI do takeaways every week and have for the better part of the last decade on Maize n Brew. I’ve covered many wins, and some seasons that have been absolute duds (2017 stunk, 2020 hurt my soul, and the past two years have had painful moments as well), yet you, the Maize n Brew readers, are always here to interact with me and read these takeaways whether Michigan wins or loses. I say this on behalf of myself and the entire Maize n Brew staff — thank you, thank you, thank you! You are part of our lives, and you’re stuck with us a while longer, talking about this silly sport we love. Happy New Year! Talk to you in 2026.",

    "description": "Michigan football will be more shorthanded than expected vs Texas, with more players unavailable despite only three official opt-outs.",
    "fullText": "ORLANDO, Fla. -- There have been a lot of questions about whether Michigan football would have a full complement of players against Texas in the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl. The Longhorns have a fair amount of public opt-outs, but the Wolverines? Only three. And yet, the maize and blue could be much more shorthanded than that. Even interim head coach Biff Poggi acknowledged that on Tuesday.\n\n\"There are opt-outs and there are opt-outs, right?\" Poggi said. \"There are different kinds of opt-outs. We have three that were starters, two on defense, one on offense, who declared they were opting out. Now we have some others that this week have decided not to play based on injuries. Our number is probably more like 12 to 15 in actuality.\"\n\nEven so, it's a far cry from 25, as he said on a Texas podcast last week.\n\nSo who are those injury opt-outs? The Big Ten released Michigan's player availability for the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl and here is who may or may not be available due to injuries.\n\nKickoff is at 3 p.m. EST at Camping World Stadium, and the game will be broadcast on ESPN.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Wolverines Wire: Michigan football availability report shows more absences vs. Texas",

    "description": "The Citrus Bowl is here, and for the last time in 2025, Michigan Football is set to take the field. Here are 3 keys to victory for the Wolverines vs Texas:",
    "fullText": "Bowl season is here, and after a tumultuous month of December, the No. 18 Michigan Wolverines — with an interim head coach in place — are set to take on the No. 13 Texas Longhorns in the Citrus Bowl today in Orlando.\n\nBoth teams had hopes of making the College Football Playoff this season, but failed to get in after 9-3 regular seasons. As most of these non-CFP bowl games go, several players are opting out on both sides; Texas won’t have key players on both sides of the ball, and the Wolverines will be without guys like Derrick Moore, Jaishawn Barham and Giovanni El-Hadi.\n\nHere are the final three keys to victory for the 2025 season for the Wolverines.\n\nWhen Michigan’s offense is on the field against Texas’ defense, both teams will be led by interim coordinators. For the Wolverines, co-offensive coordinator and tight ends coach Steve Casula will be calling plays with Chip Lindsey off to Missouri, and inside linebackers coach and co-defensive coordinator Johnny Nansen will be calling plays defensively after Texas fired defensive coordinator Pete Kwiatkowski earlier this month.\n\nWhile many key defensive starters are out for the Longhorns, All-American linebacker Colin Simmons, a projected first-round pick with 11 sacks, will be playing. Simmons can wreck an entire game plan, so Michigan will have to be cognizant of where he is at all times.\n\nCasula needs to include protections for Simmons in his game plan, as chipping him with tight ends Marlin Klein and others can help buy Bryce Underwood time in the pocket. Casula also needs to be aggressive against a depleted Texas defense — what exactly does he have to lose at this point? Putting together first downs by any means necessary is the priority, so I want to see him have a proper mix of run plays and pass plays.\n\nUnderwood showed flashes of his five-star talent this season, but was inconsistent overall. Needless to say, Lindsey and Moore didn’t take a lot of risks with him as a playmaker. To use a metaphor, Michigan has a Lamborghini, but it rarely took it out of the neighborhood.\n\nWith a new play caller, I want to see Underwood’s full potential in this game. Throw in a few long passes, use a few creative plays throwing to Jordan Marshall out of the backfield, let Underwood make decisions in the read-option, and maybe scheme up a few designed runs for the freshman phenom.\n\nUnderwood is a talented enough player to pull off this upset. Throw out the conservative game plan and let him lead you to the promised land.\n\nThe expectations were too high for Texas quarterback Arch Manning to start this season, and he struggled early in the season. But he really came into his own to close out the year.\n\nYahoo NFL analyst Nate Tice said Manning would be the No. 1 pick in the draft if he declared. Breaking down his season through the NFL lens, CBS Sports’ Mike Renner gave him a C+ when it came to decision-making. Here’s what Renner wrote:\n\n“There are still numerous issues with his decision-making evaluators will want to see cleaned up. The two biggest are turning down easy completions and pre-determining two- or three-man concepts.\n\n‘The first is not uncommon with mobile quarterbacks who like to hunt big plays, but you have to take profits when you can in the NFL. The second is probably the more worrisome. What makes it all the more head-scratching is that he’s awesome going 1-to-2-to-3 on full-field reads. Give him a binary choice on one side, and he’d too often miss a receiver streaking wide open.”\n\nManning struggled with interceptions earlier this fall, but he didn’t throw a pick in Texas’ last two games (wins against Arkansas and Texas A&M). Michigan is going to need Manning to turn over the ball once or twice to win this one, so I’d expect Wink Martindale to dial up some NFL blitzes to force Manning to make quick decisions. If he hunts the big plays that Renner referred to, Michigan may be able to swing momentum with a pick or two.\n\nWhat else does Michigan need to do to win this game? Let us know in the comments.",

Sheriff's deputies and volunteers have been searching around the clock for her since and there was information to suggest she was in \"imminent danger,\" according to Sheriff Javier Salazar.\n\nWhile searching an area Tuesday afternoon, authorities found a body in a field approximately 100 yards from Mendoza Olmos' home, in northwest Bexar County, Salazar said.\n\n\"At this point we don't suspect foul play,\" he said during a press briefing.\n\nThe body has not yet been officially identified and a cause and manner of death have not yet been determined by the local medical examiner, Salazar said.\n\n\"We hope that we can try to expedite that process to be able to get the community answers,\" he said.\n\nSalazar noted there were some indicators of self-harm.\n\nA firearm was located at the scene where the body was found, Salazar said.

    "fullText": "Jacob Rodriguez position change: How Texas Tech star went from QB recruit to All-American linebacker originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Texas Tech Red Raiders are making their first-ever College Football Playoff debut, set to take on the Oregon Ducks in the Orange Bowl quarterfinal matchup.\n\nA big reason for Tech's success this season is how well linebacker Jacob Rodriguez has been playing. He leads the Red Raiders in tackles with 117 total stops on the year, and has helped lead Texas Tech into an elite defense this season.\n\nBut what you may not know about the veteran linebacker is that he actually only started playing defense once he got to Texas Tech in 2022, previously starting his career at Virginia as an offensive player.\n\nLet's take a look at how Rodriguez transformed his college career, moving from offense to defense.\n\nMORE:History behind Texas Tech's tortilla-throwing tradition\n\nRodriguez attended Rider High School in Wichita Falls, Texas, where he played both quarterback and free safety. Per his Texas Tech bio, he passed for 7,085 yards with 68 touchdowns, adding 3,051 yards and 38 touchdowns on the ground. His high school made two trips to the  Class 5A Division II state semifinals during his sophomore and senior seasons.\n\nPer his 247Sports recruiting page, Rodrigues also played basketball and participated in the long jump, triple jump and relays for his track and field team.\n\nMORE:Revisiting Patrick Mahomes' Texas Tech career\n\nGiven his multi-position background in high school, he was listed as an athlete by 247Sports. The outlet listed him as a 3-star, ranked as the No. 26 athlete from the class of 2021.\n\nHe received offers from a number of power-conference schools, such as Baylor, Houston, Indiana, Kansas State, Iowa State and Virginia. He committed to the Cavaliers' 2021 class in April 2020 and remained committed up through his Dec. signing. Despite other schools wanting him to play defense, UVA actually recruited Rodriguez as a quarterback.\n\n“That had a little effect on my decision,” Rodriguez said in April 2020 via the Times Record News. “Beyond playing football, I want to go into coaching. I feel like learning the quarterback position at the college level gives me a better understanding of play calls and how to learn how to do things as a whole on offense.\"\n\nBut once he got to Virginia, he was utilized at a number of positions on offense, including receiver and fullback. He appeared in all 12 games as a true freshman, getting eight receptions for 65 yards and a touchdown with another 10 carries for 56 yards on the ground.\n\nHe played behind UVA quarterback Brennan Armstrong, who broke single-season records for the Cavaliers in 2021.\n\nPer a recent ESPN feature on Rodriguez, UVA coaches told him they planned to make him into the next Taysom Hill. But his time in Charlottesville lasted just one season, as he entered the transfer portal in Dec. 2021 after UVA head coach Bronco Mendenhall abruptly resigned after six seasons as the Cavs head coach.\n\nMORE:Picks, predictions  for 2025 CFP quarterfinal games\n\nRodriguez entered the portal largely because of Mendenhall leaving.\n\n\"I loved it there and loved the people there,\" Rodriguez said via ESPN of his time at Virginia. \"But I kind of went there to play for him.\"\n\nTexas Tech head coach Joey McGuire, who had recruited Rodriguez in high school while he was at Baylor, offered Rodriguez a spot on the team as a walk-on, but was placed on scholarship before the 2022 season.\n\nPrior to him transferring to Texas Tech, the Red Raiders coaches informed him he would not be joining as a quarterback. Although it took some time, Rodriguez started figuring out the defensive side of things in 2022.\n\n\"Really just knowing that I can make an impact whatever position I play,\" Rodriguez said via NWA Online of the position change. \"I've done it on the offensive side of the ball, I've done it on the defensive side of a ball, and I've done it on special teams. I can really play with anybody,\" he said. \"That's kind of when I figured I can do this. I saw myself progressing a lot on the defensive side of the ball, and week to week just getting better and better.\"\n\nLOOK:Texas Tech's 'Too-Cold' uniforms\n\nRodriguez finished with a combined 59 total tackles during his first two seasons at linebacker. But you can see the huge numbers he's put up during his junior and senior seasons:\n\nUnsurprisingly, Rodriguez cleaned up during the college football awards season. Here's a look at each award he took home:\n\nChuck Bednarik Award (nation's top defensive player)\n\nButkus Award (nation's top linebacker)\n\nBronko Nagurski Trophy (nation's top defensive player)\n\nLombardi Award (nation's top lineman or linebacker)\n\nPony Express Award (nation's top duo with David Bailey)\n\nDespite a campaign for him to be a Heisman finalist, was not invited to New York City. Even still, the linebacker impressively finished fifth in Heisman voting, receiving 17 first-place votes.\n\nMORE:Why Michigan landed the perfect replacement for Sherrone Moore in Kyle Whittingham",

    "description": "Texas Christian running back Jeremy Payne scores on a 35-yard catch-and-run in overtime, sending No. 16 USC to a shocking, 30-27 loss in the Alamo Bowl.",
    "fullText": "For a nine-win team like USC, once again on the outside looking in at the College Football Playoff, the bowl season can feel a bit like purgatory. One foot in the past season, the other in the future, your team trapped somewhere in between.\n\nThere were glimpses of each Tuesday night for USC, in a brutal 30-27 Alamo Bowl overtime defeat at the hands of Texas Christian. Equal reminders both of what could have been this season, had USC ever played at its best for long, and also flashes of why it never managed to come together.\n\nIn one moment, there was true freshman Tanook Hines, sprinting to catch a deep ball in stride, announcing himself as a rising star. In another, a TCU running back was busting his way through tackles on third-and-long, rumbling his way into the end zone, deflating any delusions of grandeur.\n\nBut the final minutes took the Trojans on a tour of all the most glaring concerns from their 2025 season, from the leaky defense to the missed opportunities on offense. USC had led by two scores with less than five minutes remaining, only to see its lead evaporate in that span.\n\nIt got all the way to the five-yard line in overtime, but failed to punch in, settling for a field goal that would spell its demise.\n\nThough, it didn’t seem to be headed that way as TCU faced a third and 20, with its hopes hanging in the balance. Quarterback Ken Seals simply dumped it off to his running back, Jeremy Payne, and hoped for the best.\n\nHe got it, all while dealing the Trojans a nightmarish conclusion in the process.\n\nPayne broke one tackle, then another, then another, rumbling his way 35 yards until he’d scored a walk-off touchdown, leaving USC with a 9-4 record and bitter taste in its mouth heading into the offseason.\n\nThere had been multiple chances throughout for USC to put the game away, just like there had been multiple chances in each of the Trojans’ four losses this season.\n\nAnd now, USC faces a litany of questions unanswered, not the least of which being what direction will USC take its defense, after coordinator D’Anton Lynn departed for Penn State just before the game.\n\nUSC certainly played like it had lost its coordinator and half of its starters on that side of the ball, giving up 144 yards in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe questions raised Tuesday, however, did not include how USC might replace its No. 1 wideout next season. Hines had already done his part to earn that role, but declared it to the world with a six-catch, 163-yard performance.\n\nKing Miller offered similar confidence in the future of USC’s rushing attack, running for 99 yards and a touchdown.\n\nBut they may have been the only two. Jayden Maiava, who will return next season, completed 18 of 30 passes for 280 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions.\n\nUSC was already facing an uphill climb with its roster, considering over a dozen starters or would-be starters were out for one reason or another. Three of the Trojans’ starting offensive linemen didn’t dress. Both of their top receivers and top tight end were in street clothes, having already declared for the NFL draft. Twenty-five players listed in USC’s two-deep were either freshmen or redshirt freshmen.\n\nThen there was the matter of being without their defensive coordinator. Lynn left the team a day after he officially took the same job at Penn State. The decision for Lynn not to coach the bowl was described to The Times as “a mutual agreement”. But his absence left USC to entrust defensive line coach Eric Henderson to step into a role he wasn’t expecting.\n\nIt went quite smoothly at first. USC held TCU to two straight three-and-outs — and just 11 total yards in two drives — to open the game.\n\nBut on the ensuing possession, Maiava threw into heavy coverage in the seam. His pass was picked off. The momentum USC had built up dissolved almost instantly.\n\nThe defense’s strong start faded into disarray. TCU turned up the tempo and mounted consecutive touchdown drives. Mistakes piled up for a defense that was relying on inexperienced players at every level. Tackling, which was improved all season, suddenly was a struggle.\n\nTwice, USC stalled after promising drives, deep in TCU territory, leaving it to settle for a pair of first-half field goals and take a 14-13 deficit into halftime.\n\nUSC came out of the locker room looking ready to kick into gear. Linebacker Jadyn Walker tipped a pass deep in TCU territory, and safety Christian Pierce came down with the interception, putting USC in perfect position to capitalize.\n\nUSC handed it right back. With the ball at the seven-yard line, Maiava threw into traffic once again. It was picked off in the end zone.\n\nBut this time, USC’s defense managed to salvage the mistake, forcing a three-and-out, only to find itself on the field again less than 90 seconds later. It got another stop, nonetheless.\n\nMaiava finally made the most of that opportunity. He hit Hines in stride on a 46-yard bomb, then found senior Jaden Richardson in the corner of the end zone for a stunning, one-handed score.\n\nBut TCU refused to go away. The Horned Frogs mounted two scoring drives in the final five minutes, forcing overtime.\n\n In your inbox every Monday morning.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "ARLINGTON, Texas — The Cotton Bowl certainly has gotten much more significant for Ohio State during three trips in a row to the game.\n\nThis time, the second-seeded Buckeyes (12-1) are defending national champions as they get ready to play College Football Playoff first-timer Miami (11-2, CFP No. 10 seed) in a quarterfinal here Wednesday night. The Cotton Bowl last January was a CFP semifinal when Ohio State beat Texas for the third of four wins needed last postseason for a sixth Associated Press national title.\n\nAs for the first of those appearances in North Texas two years ago, that was the last season before the CFP expanded from four to 12 teams and when it wasn’t the Cotton Bowl’s turn as one of the playoff games. The Buckeyes arrived then coming off a regular season-ending loss to rival Michigan after a 10-0 start. Their starting quarterback (Kyle McCord) had transferred and NFL-bound All-American receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. opted out of playing in what was a 14-3 loss to Missouri.\n\n“Just more stakes than the first game I’ve ever played in here. ... Now it’s a bowl game with the playoffs on the line, so it just means more,” senior receiver Carnell Tate said Monday on the field at AT&T Stadium.\n\n“It wasn’t CFP, so I felt like the job was not accomplished. We kind of fell short of our initial goal, and then when we played here, our quarterback ended up transferring. It was a whole lot of stuff going on,” senior cornerback Davison Igbinosun said. “It was definitely a tough game. It really didn’t feel like a typical Ohio State game, and then here last year and back in the playoffs, and that was a great game.”\n\nOhio State hasn’t played since losing 13-10 to No. 1 Indiana in the Big Ten Championship Game matchup of undefeated teams on Dec. 6, and still got a first-round bye.\n\nMiami, which is 24 years removed from its last national title, made its CFP debut with a 10-3 win in the first round at No. 7 seed Texas A&M on Dec. 20. The Hurricanes made the 12-team playoff field even after not making the ACC title game and that league’s champ (five-loss Duke) not getting a bid.\n\nWhen the Hurricanes left Dallas after a 26-20 overtime loss at SMU on Nov. 1, their second loss in three games after a 5-0 start, they weren’t even sure they would make the playoff. Now they are back in Texas for their second playoff game in a row and with another five-game winning streak.\n\n“That was a low point for us in the season, and in that locker room, it was as simple as a decision has to be made,” Miami coach Mario Cristobal said. “It came down to the simplicity of taking all the clips of us in our first five games and putting it on a reel and just letting it play. No audio, no one’s talking, no nothing. Just shut the lights, remind ourselves of who we are. And there’s nothing more powerful than the power of choice.”\n\nHeisman Trophy finalist Julian Sayin with Ohio State and Miami’s Carson Beck have both been part of national championship teams. Now the two most accurate Football Bowl Subdivision passers are trying to win a title as a starting quarterback.\n\nSayin was the Buckeyes’ backup last year behind Will Howard. Beck transferred to Miami after being at Georgia from 2020-24, when he was a youngster on the Bulldogs’ back-to-back national championship teams in 2021 and 2022 — he did get some late snaps in that second title game, a 65-7 romp over TCU.\n\nThe Cotton Bowl will be the first CFP game for Sayin, the sophomore who has thrown for 3,323 yards with 31 TDs and six interceptions. He has completed 78.4% of his passes (279 of 356). Beck made his first CFP start going 14-of-20 for 103 yards and a touchdown on a windy day in College Station. He has completed 74.5% of his passes (277 of 372) for 3,175 yards, 26 TDs and 10 interceptions.\n\nMiami’s last shot at back-to-back national championships ended in a double-overtime loss to Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 3, 2003, before most of the current players were born and the only other time these teams have met in a bowl game.\n\nOhio State, which won the first CFP national championship at AT&T Stadium at the end of the 2014 season, is now trying to win consecutive national titles for the first time. The Buckeyes are in their seventh CFP overall, and are the only team to appear in five of the last seven — all of those since Ryan Day became their head coach.\n\nThe only other time the Hurricanes played in the Cotton Bowl was at the end of the 1990 season, their last as an independent before moving to the Big East. They beat Texas 46-3 in Cotton Bowl Stadium.\n\nNO. 10 MIAMI VS. NO. 2 OHIO STATE\n\nCotton Bowl, 7:30 Wednesday, Arlington, Texas\n\nTV: ESPN Line/OU: Ohio State by 9 ½; 40 ½",

Kennedy Memorial Causeway that connects Laguna Madre and North Padre Island in Corpus Christi.\n\nBut the two never made it to Florida and were never heard from again.\n\nTwenty years later, Christian's family is still looking for him, with the help of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC).\n\nChristian’s aunt, Carla Boehm, told NCMEC she thinks her nephew could still be alive. If he is, she wants him to know that his family loves him and would love to see him again.\n\n“If he thinks nobody cares, maybe he's not even trying to come home,” Boehm told NCMEC.\n\nNow the organization is releasing a new age-progressed image created by a forensic artist to show what Christian may look like today at 35.\n\nOver the years, very little information about what happened to Christian and Andrews has surfaced.\n\nAndrews did not have permission to take the teen with him on the boat, authorities have said.\n\nOn Jan. 4, 2006, Christian's family reported him missing.\n\nThe Texas Department of Public Safety also put out a bulletin that Christian was missing, along with a picture of Andrews and the boat.\n\nWhat authorities do know is that Christian and Andrews, now 59, were in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana when the sailboat signaled for mayday, NCMEC reports.\n\nThe boat was taking in water, but the two declined any help, authorities said.\n\nBoehm remains hopeful that she and her family will be reunited with Christian.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? \n\n“I hope he's out there, and that he sees this new picture and realizes people are looking for him, and that he's wanted,” she told NCMEC.\n\nAnyone with information about Christian Hall or his disappearance is asked to contact NCMEC at 1-800-THE-LOST (1-800-843-5678) or the Corpus Christi Police Department at 1-361-886-2600.",

    "fullText": "(The Center Square) – According to an analysis of migration data from the three most populous states, more Californians and Floridians are moving to Texas than Texans are moving to those states.\n\nOverall, the majority of out-of-state movers relocating to Texas are leaving Democratic-led states that have higher state income taxes and more progressive tax policies than Texas has.\n\nAccording to an analysis of moves over a 12-month period, based on PGM’s database of 18 million moves tracked between June 2024 and May 2025, more than 1.6 million adults moved to or within Texas during this timeframe.\n\nAmong them were 265,112 from out of state, averaging 22,092 a month, or 726 a day, according to the data.\n\nThe majority moving from out of state to Texas were from California (14%), Florida (9%), and Colorado (4.5%), representing nearly one-third of new Texas residents, according to the data. Movers from Arizona (3.8%) and Illinois (3.7%) rounded out the top five, according to the data.\n\nWhen evaluating the data among the top three most populous states, more Californians and Floridians moved to Texas than the reverse, according to a breakdown of the data Hire A Helper exclusively provided to The Center Square.\n\nMore than double the number of Californians moved to Texas, 37,253, than Texans moved to California, 14,539, during the 12-month-period analyzed, according to the data.\n\nRoughly one-third more Floridians moved to Texas, 24,378, than Texans moved to Florida, 15,650, over the same time period, according to the data.\n\nAccording to a StorageCafe analysis, roughly 100,000 Californians have been moving to Texas a year – the equivalent of the population of Santa Barbara, The Center Square reported.\n\nSimilarly, roughly one-third more Californians moved to Florida, 16,457, than Floridians moved to California, 11,356, during the same 12 months, according to the data.\n\nOf the moving demographics PGM analyzed, “Gen X and millennials made up 75% of new Texans, signaling a wave of professionals and families chasing opportunity, affordability, and a higher quality of life,” Hire A Helper said.\n\nNorth Texas is the top moving destination, where business headquarters are relocating and Texas’ new stock exchange was launched, The Center Square reported.\n\nNearly 32% of those relocating moved to the Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington area during the timeframe analyzed, according to the data.\n\nThe Houston–Pasadena–The Woodlands region received the next greatest percentage of new residents, nearly 21%; the Austin–Round Rock–San Marcos region received the third greatest of 13%, according to the data.\n\nThe majority of moves in Texas over the year were in-state, 84%, “with residents shuffling between metros for better housing and jobs,” according to the analysis.\n\nSmaller cities in north Texas, including “Sherman–Denison (No. 5 for net gain), Tyler (No. 6 for net gain), and Granbury (No. 7 for net gain) are emerging as the next growth hotspots,” the report notes.\n\nTexas counties saw a massive influx of residents from July 2023 to 2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau data, The Center Square reported. Four of the top 10 counties reporting the greatest numeric growth and the greatest percentage growth in the U.S. were in Texas, according to the data.\n\nHarris County, Texas, reported the greatest population growth in 2024, followed by Miami-Dade, Florida. By contrast, California’s largest county of Los Angeles reported losses, according to the census data.\n\nOf the 10 counties reporting the greatest growth by percentage last year, four were in Texas. Two were in Florida, none were in California, according to the census data.\n\nHire A Helper data also confirms yearly census data, which shows more people are moving to southern states. When looking “at the sheer volume of people moving in minus people leaving,” states reporting the greatest number of new residents over the period analyzed were South and North Carolina, Texas, Tennessee and Florida, it said.\n\nStates where more residents left than entered are all run by Democrats: California, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Illinois, according to the data.\n\n“While California certainly had people moving in [over the year analyzed], it saw an overall net decrease in residents, -128,470,” Hire A Helper said.\n\nOne key contributing factor is state income tax, the report notes. Three of the five states people are moving to have no state income tax: Texas, Tennessee and Florida. The five states experiencing an exodus have among the highest taxes in the country.",

Kiffin managed to draw laughs with a grocery store moment. But he took a new step in winning over a rabid fanbase with an action involving Malik Nabers and the Texas Bowl.\n\nKiffin pulled into the Saturday bowl game his future team was playing in. Amid the LSU versus Houston contest, he spotted the legendary Tigers wide receiver.\n\nKiffin managed to draw new likes, retweets and comments — by snapping this photo.\n\n⁦@LSUfootball⁩ pic.twitter.com/r4iidDEQMD\n\n— Lane Kiffin (@Lane_Kiffin) December 28, 2025\n\nWhile considered a simple photo, it’s still enough for Kiffin to draw new interest among a curious group of fans. Kiffin clearly wants to have good relations with LSU — and that includes interacting with beloved Tiger players like Nabers.\n\nBefore taking on the nation’s No. 21 team, Kiffin and LSU dealt with one roster departure.\n\nLeft tackle Tyree Adams opted to enter the College Football Transfer Portal on Saturday morning. Adams rises as a pivotal early loss for the incoming head coach — with the offensive lineman surrendering zero sacks in 11 starts. He has two years of eligibility left.\n\nKiffin will need to hit the portal to find his replacement. Or he can insert incoming freshman Brysten Martinez as the blindside protector moving forward. He was a local signing for the 2026 class out of Gonzalez, La., and heads to Baton Rouge as a four-star signing.\n\nLSU, meanwhile, engaged in a close contest with the Big 12 representative as UH led 28-21 before the start of the fourth quarter.",

    "description": "The closure is expected to result in the loss of about 300 jobs in the Central Valley.",
    "fullText": "The world’s largest mozzarella cheese producer is shuttering one if its Central Valley plants, resulting in the loss of about 300 jobs.\n\nAccording to records on file with the California Employment Development Department, 268 people will be laid off at the Leprino Foods Lemoore East plant on Jan. 9 due to the facility’s permanent closure. Another 100 employees are expected to lose their jobs by Dec. 30, 2026.\n\nAttempts to reach Leprino Foods on Friday were unsuccessful.\n\nThe company announced the layoffs in November 2024, citing the Lemoore East facility’s age and equipment and high operating costs in California, according to a report in the Hanford Sentinel.\n\n“This decision is influenced by several factors, including the facility’s age, anticipated capital requirements to make improvements to the facility and add or replace equipment and systems, high operating costs in California, the long-term milk supply outlook, and the increased capacity due to the opening of our Lubbock, Texas, facility,” a Leprino spokesperson told The Sentinel.\n\nThe company is a major employer in Kings County and has two plants in Lemoore, Lemoore East and West. Lemoore West is one of the largest manufacturing facilities in the world — with more than 11 football fields worth of cheese-making capacity — while Lemoore East has been a continuous dairy operation since 1910, according to the company’s website. Leprino took over the East facility in the 1980s, SF Gate reported.\n\nThe two Leprino facilities in Lemoore process approximately 14 million pounds of milk and produce an average of 1.5 million pounds of mozzarella cheese and related products per day, according to state water board records.\n\nThe company’s Lemoore West plant isn’t expected to be impacted, according to media reports. The company also has a facility in the San Joaquin County city of Tracy.\n\nIn 2021, the company announced the opening of a new, $870 million state-of-the-art 850,000 square foot dairy manufacturing facility in Lubbock, Texas that will provide 600 jobs. Construction is expected to be completed in early 2026.\n\nFounded in 1950 and headquartered in Denver, Leprino Foods supplies cheese for food manufacturers and major pizza chains. The company employs more than 5,500 people worldwide and has U.S.-based processing plants in California, Colorado, New Mexico, Michigan, New York and Texas.\n\nAnother Valley food processing business has traded California for Texas in recent years.\n\nIn 2023, frozen food manufacturer Ruiz Foods announced it was moving its Tulare County corporate headquarters to Frisco, Texas. The company said the decision was due to the central geographic location to reach customers nationwide and the availability of talent near the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.\n\nThe company’s California operations have faced a string of employee-related legal and regulatory scrutiny over the past two decades.\n\nIn 2015, Leprino’s Lemoore plant was hit with a federal class action lawsuit alleging the company violated wage-and-hour laws. Several others followed.\n\nIn 2023, the company successfully defeated a $100 million class action lawsuit filed in 2017 after a four-week jury trial in federal court, The Business Journal reported.\n\nBut employees appealed and in 2024 won a $3.5 million class action settlement.\n\nBefore that, in 2011, Leprino Foods paid $550,000 in back wages, interest and benefits to 253 workers of Black, Latino and Asian descent who were rejected for on-call laborer positions as part of a settlement with the U.S. Labor Department.",

    "description": "The Waco Connally product has a chance to become one of the first safeties taken in the 2027 NFL Draft.",
    "fullText": "Amidst departures to the NCAA transfer portal and opt outs for the Citrus Bowl against the Michigan Wolverines, the Texas Longhorns received some positive news for the 2026 season on Friday when junior safety Jelani McDonald announced his return for his senior campaign.\n\nAt 6’2 and 199 pounds, McDonald has prototypical size and explosiveness for the position that could allow him to become one of the first safeties taken in the 2027 NFL Draft if he stays healthy and maintains his developmental trajectory.\n\nOut of Waco Connally, McDonald was a late riser in the 2023 recruiting class, receiving his offer from the Longhorns in October when he was committed to Oklahoma State. TCU also factored into McDonald’s recruitment, hosting him for an official and unofficial visit late in the process, but it was McDonald’s time on the Forty Acres in December that ultimately sealed his decision to spurn his father’s alma mater and signed with Texas.\n\nA triple jumper, high jumper, and basketball standout at Connally, McDonald played quarterback, wide receiver, and on defense in high school, allowing him to finish the cycle as a consensus four-star prospect ranked as the No. 74 player nationally and the No. 2 athlete, according to the 247Sports Composite rankings.\n\nThe athlete classification certainly fit McDonald, as it wasn’t clear whether he would grow into a linebacker in college even as he displayed the ability to play cornerback despite his height. As a freshman, McDonald m0ved between nickel back, linebacker, cornerback, and safety.\n\nWhile McDonald developed behind the scenes shuffling through positions to determine his future role, he played on three special teams units for the Horns as a true freshman, recording two tackles against Oklahoma State in the Big 12 Championship game.\n\nAs a sophomore, McDonald showed signs of becoming a rising star as he was thrust into playing time due to injuries, totaling 33 tackles, one tackle for loss, one interception, and one pass broken up with four starts over 14 games.\n\nMcDonald took another step forward as a full-time starter in 2025, leading the team in tackles with 73 (43 solo) thanks to late-season injuries sustained by redshirt senior safety Michael Taaffe and junior linebacker Anthony Hill Jr., notching four tackles for loss, three interceptions, three passes broken up, and a fumble return.\n\nWith McDonald returning, Texas has one starter back at the safety position with Taaffe exhausting his eligibility.",

    "fullText": "SAN ANGELO, Texas (Concho Valley Homepage) — Click the video above to relive the Wall Hawks’ road to the 2025 state championship.\n\nIf there’s one team in the Concho Valley enjoying its 2025 holiday season, it’s the Wall Hawks. The school brought home its first-ever football state title one week ago, but this year’s championship run didn’t come as a surprise to many people.\n\nKLST Sports Director Charles Bryce had a vision. During KLST and KSAN’s 2025 High School Football Preview Show on Aug 20, he said “I can’t wait to see some of these teams that have a really good shot at winning a state championship. Let’s see who can bring one home to the Concho Valley this year.”\n\nBryce’s preseason analysis aged very well. Four months later, Wall stood tall as the Concho Valley’s lone state champion. Wall’s second-year head coach Craig Slaughter also had a vision this season, and his squad’s road to glory was in the works for years.\n\n“It still probably hasn’t sunk in, [I’m] just proud,” Slaughter said. “[I’ve gotten] so many texts from people that have followed our program for a long time. We’ve been chasing it for a long time, we’ve been in the hunt for a long time and that’s before I got here. This program has been knocking on the door for a while and it’s awesome to get that done.”\n\nWhen Slaughter became head coach in 2024, he guided the Hawks to the Class 3A Division II State Semifinals which resulted in a heartbreaking 42-32 loss to the Gunter Tigers. That loss served as motivation for players and coaches heading into the next season. One year later, Wall got its revenge with a 28-25 state semis win over Gunter.\n\n“We knew how to handle ourselves much better,” Hawks senior right tackle Will Aldridge said. “On the sidelines, you could tell we weren’t out of this game. We still had a lot more football to play, and I think a big part of it was just that maturity level.”\n\n‘We’re a fourth quarter type of team,” Hawks senior running back Brady Neal said. “We’re very physical, we’ve got good chemistry. Even though we were down, we knew that just one play could get us back in it.”\n\nIn the ensuing state championship game versus the Newton Eagles, Wall’s commanding 25-8 halftime lead proved to be just enough to secure the win. The Hawks survived the Eagles’ second-half comeback attempt, which fell one point short as Wall held on to win 25-24.\n\n“I can’t give enough credit to our kids,” coach Slaughter said. “Their composure is awesome. They just keep playing, and they found themselves a state championship.”\n\nWall’s season-defining theme revolved around talent and depth. The Hawks’ stacked roster featured 23 seniors, giving them the edge over opponents in terms of experience.\n\n“Ours wasn’t just 23 players,” coach Slaughter said. “There were 23 leaders, strong kids, and just a talented roster. Some of the kids were waiting in line for reps for us, and it just speaks to the depth of that squad.”\n\nAfter many years of knocking on the doorstep, the Wall Hawks can finally call themselves state champions. This 2025 championship team will be remembered for many years to come.",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M's 2025 wide receiver was highly productive. It provided a glimpse of the future: new offensive coordinator Holmon Wiggins, who remains the WR coach, should continue what former OC Collin Klein achieved this season, while his only job right now is to land one or two wide receivers from the transfer portal.\n\nWith KC Concepcion, who finished his only season in College Station with 61 receptions for 919 yards and nine touchdowns, paired with 1,450 all-purpose yards and two punt return touchdowns, declaring for the 2026 NFL Draft, it was reported that Kansas State transfer wide receiver Jayce Brown, who reportedly visited during the Aggies' CFP loss to Miami on Saturday, is one of Elko and Wiggins's primary targets.\n\nHowever, according to On3's Pete Nakos, former Auburn wide receiver Malcolm Simmons, who recently entered the transfer portal, holds a direct connection with Holmon Wiggins, who, during his time as Alabama's WR and assistant head coach, heavily recruited Simmons.\n\nAmong the early schools to watch for Auburn wide receiver Malcolm Simmons are Kentucky, Arkansas, Georgia and Texas A&M.\n\nFinishing his Auburn career with 65 receptions, 908 yards, and five touchdowns, Simmons was highly productive in the final two games of the 2025 season, reeling in 149 receiving yards and a touchdown against Mercer, and, in the Iron Bowl loss to Alabama, recorded 143 yards and a touchdown, averaging 47 yards per reception.\n\nLike Jayce Brown, Simmons will be highly coveted due to his speed and playmaking ability after the catch, and would be an immediate impact player alongside Texas A&M's speed 2026 wide receiver rotation, led by incoming junior Mario Craver.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M has been connected to Auburn transfer WR Malcolm Simmons",

    "fullText": "A Texas power developer is proposing to repurpose nuclear reactors from Navy warships to power the United States grid as the Trump administration pushes to secure massive amounts of energy for the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nHGP Intelligent Energy LLC filed an application to the Energy Department to redirect two retired reactors to a data centre project proposed at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, according to a letter submitted to the agency’s Office of Energy Dominance Financing. The project, filed for the White House’s Genesis Mission, would produce about 450-520 megawatts of around-the-clock electricity, or enough to power roughly 360,000 homes.\n\nIn theory, tapping the reactors could become one of the fastest ways to add baseload power to the grid as the U.S. struggles to meet surging power demand. Building new reactors — traditional big plants or next-generation smaller units — are years away, as are new big natural gas-fired plants. Repurposing military reactors for such civilian use, however, is unchartered territory.\n\nNaval aircraft carriers or submarines are each equipped with two reactors: A4W units made by Westinghouse Electric Co. or S8G-class units made by General Electric. Rewiring two of them would cost about US$1 million to US$4 million per megawatt, a fraction of building new reactor, according to the proposal. HGP’s plan includes a revenue share with the government, and the company would create a decommissioning fund.\n\nThe developer plans to file for a loan guarantee from the Energy Department, according to the letter. The project would require about US$1.8 billion to US$2.1 billion of private capital to build related infrastructure to prepare the reactors for general use, according to the proposal submitted to the DOE and seen by Bloomberg News. The first phase could be completed as soon as 2029, according to the proposal.\n\n“We already know how to do this safely and at scale, and we’re fortunate to have a solid base of investors and partners who share that vision,” HGP chief executive Gregory Forero said in a statement.\n\nWith assistance from Joe Deaux.",

On paper, Brown is a plug-and-play receiver and would pair well with incoming junior Mario Craver and sophomore Ashton Bethel-Roman.\n\nIf the Aggies land Brown, this shores up the 2026 wide receiver room, which still lacks size, but will be one of the fastest units in the country.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M is the 'school of note' for transfer WR Jayce Brown",

    "fullText": "Air traffic controllers lost communication for about 10 minutes with a small Mexican Navy plane carrying a young medical patient and seven others before it crashed off the Texas coast in thick fog, killing at least six people, Mexico's government said Tuesday.\n\nThe plane was working with a nonprofit group transporting Mexican children with severe burns to a hospital in Galveston, near Houston, when the plane crashed Monday afternoon. Authorities believed the plane had landed, but the flight had lost contact with air controllers, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday in her morning briefing.\n\nTeams found the dead bodies of five people and pulled two survivors from the plane's wreckage, then set off on a daylong search in the waters near Galveston for 29-year-old Navy Lieutenant Luis Enrique Castillo. Castillo's family back in their rural town in southern Mexico were left scrambling for answers, hoping for the best for their missing son.\n\n“We don't know what to do,\" his father Eduardo Castillo said Tuesday. “All we can do is wait. We can’t go to the United States, we have no visa.\"\n\nThe search came to an end Tuesday night when search teams found Castillo's body. American authorities are investigating the the cause, but the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday that it could take a week or more to recover the aircraft.\n\n“What happened is very tragic,” Sheinbaum said in her morning press briefing, noting that sailors were among the dead.\n\nPlane was too low as it descended\n\nAs the twin turboprop Beech King Air 350i approached Sholes International Airport in Galveston, radar shows it was far too low, said Jeff Guzzetti, a former NTSB and Federal Aviation Administration crash investigator.\n\nA navigation system for the runway where the plane was supposed to land had been out of service for about a week, Guzzetti said. The system sends signals to the airplane cockpit that helps pilots navigate in the kind of bad weather that had enveloped the area. The fog was so thick that meteorologists estimated only about a half-mile of visibility.\n\nThe pilot should have aborted the landing if the runway wasn't visible at an altitude of 205 feet (62.5 meters), climbing back up before trying again or looking for another airport entirely, Guzzetti said.\n\nGuzzetti said the reported radar track shows that the pilot was descending rapidly below 200 feet (61 meters), a full 2 miles (3 kilometers) away from the runway.\n\n“Maybe there was some sort of mechanical malfunction,\" he said. “But just looking at the recorded flight track and comparing it with the weather and the airport equipment outage, seems to me that this landing approach should never have occurred.”\n\nThe plane crashed in a bay near the base of the causeway connecting Galveston Island to the mainland. The popular beach destination is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of Houston.\n\nSky Decker, a professional yacht captain who lives near the crash site, said he jumped in his boat to see if he could help. He picked up two police officers who guided him through the thick fog to the nearly submerged plane. Decker jumped into the water and found a badly injured woman trapped beneath chairs and other debris.\n\n“She had maybe 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of air gap to breathe in,\" he said. \"And there was jet fuel in there mixed with the water, fumes real bad. She was really fighting for her life.”\n\nHe said he also pulled out a man seated in front of her who had already died.\n\nEduardo Castillo gathered with the rest of his family and friends Tuesday afternoon in their small community of El Pantano in the sweltering southern Mexican state of Veracruz.\n\nThe father, who worked long hours as a carpenter to give his son the opportunities he never had, was desperately refreshing his phone every few minutes, looking for any news of their missing son. Mexico's Marines, he noted, had provided few other details than a call saying their son was missing.\n\nFramed pictures of Luis Enrique Castillo and his many diplomas coated a wall of their home. He and his wife were expecting a baby due in three months.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Castillo heard his phone ring and answered, hearing the words he had dreaded. His son was dead.\n\n“Now he's never going to meet his unborn child,” Eduard Castillo said as his family hugged and sobbed around him.\n\nInvestigators dig into the cause\n\nA spokesperson for the NTSB said in an email that investigators will review maintenance records, weather forecasts and air traffic control communications. A preliminary report is expected within 30 days.\n\nGuzzetti said the investigation also will likely look into how serious the young patient's medical condition was and how motivated the pilot was to land.\n\n“There have been previous accidents in the air medical community where pilots try to push their luck in order to save the patient,” he said.\n\nThe aircraft had a “very, very proven design,” said aviation safety expert John Cox. He said it’s the latest version of a series that has been in use since the 1960s and would have been outfitted with all the modern electronics, avionics and equipment.\n\nPlane was helping with medical mission\n\nMexico's Navy said the plane was helping with a medical mission in coordination with the Michou and Mau Foundation.\n\nThe charity was founded after a mother died trying to save her kids from a fire. One child died, while another survived after receiving treatment at Shriners Children's Texas in Galveston. Over 23 years, the foundation has helped transfer more than 2,000 patients to that hospital and other medical facilities with burn expertise, according to the charity's website.\n\nIn a social media post, the foundation offered condolences to the families of the crash victims.\n\nShriners Children’s Texas said in a statement that it learned of the crash with “profound sadness” but wasn't able to provide any information about the child's condition.\n\nCrash comes amid focus on aviation safety\n\nThis latest crash comes amid a year of intense scrutiny on aviation safety after a string of high-profile crashes and the flight disruptions during the government shutdown driven by the shortage of air traffic controllers.\n\nThe January midair collision between an Army helicopter and an airliner near Washington, D.C., was followed by the crash of a medical transport plane in Philadelphia. This fall’s fiery UPS plane crash only added to the concerns. Still, the total number of crashes in 2025 was actually down a bit from last year, and experts say flying remains safe overall.\n\nMarquez reported from El Pantano and Janetsky reported from Mexico City.

    "fullText": "The future of high school football is here, and it’s burning bright. From California to Florida, Texas to Pennsylvania, gridiron stars have performed all across the country the past few months to electrify on Friday nights. We’re unveiling our Sophomore All-American list – the names you need to know now, because you’ll be hearing about them all throughout the off-season and into 2026. These athletes aren’t just talented; they’re the game-changers from this past 2025 high school football campaign.\n\nQB: Lukas Prock, Hun School\nWe’d be hard pressed to not have Prock heading up this list as the country’s top quarterback when you look at production, talent and competition he faced in 2025. The 6-foot-2, 180-pound quarterback went up against the likes of teams in Archbishop Spalding (Md.), The St. James Academy (Md.), St. Frances Academy (Md.), The First Academy and IMG Academy. The signal caller finished the season completing 226 of 309 passes for 4,330 yards and 41 touchdowns.\n\nRB: Xander Edwards, The Bolles School (Fla.)\nEdwards had himself a breakout season playing for the FHSAA Class 2A state semifinalist Bolles bulldogs. The sophomore running back averaged a ridiculous 9.9 yards per carry and rushed for 2,629 and scored 44 times on the ground. Add in his 17 catches for 211 yards and Edwards finishes just shy of 3,000 all-purpose yards for the 2025 season.\n\nRB: Zaiden Jernigan, Louisville (MS)\nJernigan made his name well known throughout the Magnolia State this past 2025 season as the running back put up some of the top numbers of any back in the country when it came to sophomores. The running back rushed for 1,563 yards on 238 carries and scored 20 touchdowns. The sophomore also added 205 yards and four touchdowns out of the backfield.\n\nWR: Roye Oliver, Hamilton (Ariz.)\nOliver was as good as advertised anytime he took the field for Hamilton, finishing the season catching 92 passes for 1,839 yards and scoring 29 touchdowns. There’s little doubt that Oliver is one of the country’s best wide receivers, regardless of class as he proved himself this 2025 campaign.\n\nWR: Brysen Wright, Mandarin (Fla.)\nThe four-star do-everything has done it all just about for Mandarin this past season, with Wright catching 46 passes for 983 yards and 10 touchdowns. Wright has also seen plenty of time on the defensive side of the ball as well, notching 63 tackles and intercepting five passes. The sophomore also contributed in the punt return game, totaling 254 yards on six returns.\n\nWR: Eric McFarland, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nThough McFarland reclassified to the Class of 2027, he was considered a sophomore throughout the entire 2025 high school football season. McFarland has shown his versatility not only going downfield, but also on jet sweeps, pop passes and even just taking hand-offs. Through nine games, McFarland caught 29 passes for 595 yards and scored 11 touchdowns.\n\nOT: R’Monie Edwards, Cypress Ranch (TX)\nAt 6-foot-5, 260 pounds, the offensive tackle was near impossible to get by for opposing defensive ends down in the Lone Star State. Rated a four-star by the Rivals Industry Rankings, Edwards led the way up front for over 4,500 all-purpose yards, 58 touchdowns and 463 points scored in 2025.\n\nOL: Elisha Mueller, Servite (Calif.)\nPlaying up against some of the top high school football programs in the land, Mueller held his own and then some for the Friars. Mueller is interchangeable at either guard position and led the way for Servite’s offense that totaled over 3,500 all-purpose yards and 39 touchdowns.\n\nC: Hunter Hill, Peach County (Ga.)\nHill can play center or at either guard position as he did during the 2025 season for the 10-2 Peach County Trojans. The 6-foot-3, 305-pound interior offensive lineman was superb in Year 2 and helped the Trojans amass 4,500-plus yards of offense and scoring 58 total touchdowns.\n\nOL: George Selvie III, Sumner (Fla.)\nFamiliar with the name? That’s because his father, George Selvie, starred at USF and eventually in the NFL. Now the younger Selvie plays for his father at Sumner and has blossomed into one of the top offensive linemen in the country when it comes to sophomores. Selvie III paved the way for over 3,800 yards and 45 touchdowns for the Class 7A region finalist Stingrays.\n\nOT: Jamarios Canton, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nProtecting the right side of Jayden Wade on Friday nights, Canton proved anytime out on the field that he was the top offensive tackle of the 2028 class. At 6-foot-4, 260 pounds, the offensive tackle took on all comers and right out of the gates against Hoover (Ala.) was pancaking opposing defensive linemen.\n\nAll-Purpose: Gaige Weddle, Rancho Bernardo (Calif.)\nI mean, what didn’t Weddle do for Rancho Bernardo in 2025? The dual-threat quarterback threw for 2,224 yards and 19 touchdowns through the air. Weddle led the team in rushing with 679 yards on just 98 attempts and 10 scores. Oh and Weddle also led the team on defense with 101 tackles, two sacks and two interceptions. Like we said, what didn’t Weddle do? He was what you want in a all-purpose athlete.\n\nEdge: Asher Ghioto, The Bolles School (Fla.)\nNo matter where Ghioto lined up on the defensive line, the 6-foot-5, 240-pound EDGE rusher was causing havoc for opposing offensive linemen. Ghioto finished the season totaling 84 tackles, 35 for a loss and 23 sacks.\n\nDT: Kellan Hall, Christian Academy of Louisville (KY)\nAnchoring the Centurions’ defensive line all throughout their undefeated 15-0 run to the KHSAA Class 3A state championship. Hall recently received defensive first-team all-state honors playing on the defensive line. When it comes to interior defensive linemen, there’s very few as agile and quick like the 6-foot-4, 255-pound stalwart.\n\nDT: Cory Cunningham, Providence (N.C.)\nThe four-star 6-foot-4, 265-pound defensive tackle was a force in North Carolina’s Class 8A throughout the season. Cunningham was unblockable for many opposing offensive linemen as the defensive tackle racked up 60 tackles, 28 going for a loss and 15 quarterback takedowns.\n\nEdge: Jackson Vaughn, Bergen Catholic (N.J.)\nJust because the numbers might’ve went down a little from his freshman campaign doesn’t mean that Vaughn didn’t remain a factor when it came to EDGE rushers. Teams took notice and Vaughn faced plenty of double and even triple teams. The edge rusher compiled 40 tackles, 12 for a loss and eight sacks.\n\nOLB: Judah Blair, Lakota West (OH)\nBlair at 6-foot-1, 200 pounds moves like a safety, but can hit you like a ton of bricks like a linebacker. The sophomore backer had a strong year in the linebacking corps for Lakota West, tallying 57 tackles, 15.5 going for a loss, three sacks and an interception.\n\nLB: Tahj Gray, St. Joseph Regional (N.J.)\nThe sophomore linebacker proved himself on the highest level of of New Jersey high school football, helping the St. Joseph Regional Green Knights win the NJSIAA Non-Public A state championship. Gray last season ended with 102 total tackles, 10.5 for a loss, four sacks and four passes broken up.\n\nLB: Nehemiah McCary, Maplesville (Ala.)\nMcCrary was a two-way force for Maplesville this past season as the Red Devils went on to win Alabama’s Class 1A state championship. The 6-foot-2, 225-pound linebacker’s performance in the state title game came on the offensive end of the ball where McCrary rushed for 182 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nCB: A’mir Sears, West Broward (Fla.)\nOne of the biggest reasons why West Broward made it all the way to Florida’s Class 6A state championship game was the play of the four-star athlete. Sears was dynamic on both sides of the ball, with the sophomore making 61 tackles, breaking up 11 passes and intercepting three others. On offense, Sears led the Bobcats with 942 yards and 11 touchdowns.\n\nCB: Langston Pridgeon, Stone Bridge (Va.)\nMany opposing quarterbacks thought twice before throwing to Pridgeon’s side of the field in 2025. Ranked as one of the top cornerbacks in the country, Pridgeon proved himself to being one of Virginia’s best players in the Bulldogs’ defensive secondary. Whether its playing in man or zone coverages, the sophomore excelled in his sophomore campaign.\n\nS: Casey Barner, McEachern (Ga.)\nHonestly, Barner could’ve been put at a multitude of spots on this list but his natural position is at safety and there was little doubt of his talents from the moment he stepped onto the field this season. In McEachern’s season-opening win 50-17 win over Walton, Barner compiled 341 all-purpose yards and three touchdowns.\n\nS: Giovanni Tuggle, Winder-Barrow (Ga.)\nIt’s an all-Georgia safety duo with Tuggle paired with Barner in the first team defensive backfield. Tuggle saw extensive playing time for the Bulldogs this past 2025 season as the four-star safety totaled 74 tackles, five pass breakups and also intercepted four others.\n\nPK: Jack Ciancio, Phenix City Central (Ala.)\nThe sophomore kicker was automatic when it came to extra points for the Phenix City Red Devils this past season, knocking down all 75 of his attempts. Ciancio connected on 11 field goals, with a long of 38 yards.\n\nP: Israel Carmona, Queen Creek (Ariz.)\nPlacing punts inside of an opponent’s 20-yard line was a specialty of Carmona’s this past season as the sophomore pinned teams deep into their own territory 17 times. On 39 punt attempts, Carmona averaged 40.6 yards with a long of 58 on the season.\n\nReturn Specialist: Tyree Mannings, Venice (Fla.)\nMannings was superb stepping into the No. 1 receiver role at Venice after Winston Watkins Jr. graduated and had built a strong connection with Howard quarterback commit Darryon Jones. The Indians’ top wide receiver hauled in 84 passes for 1,429 yards and 12 touchdowns. Mannings was deadly in the kick return game, compiling 335 return yards for the Indians.\n\nQB: Koa Malau’ulu, St. John Bosco (Calif.)\nRB: Taihj Moore, Deland (Fla.)\nRB: Kameron Battle, Carrollwood Day (Fla.)\nWR: Jaylen Addai, Shadow Creek (TX)\nWR: Jett Harrison, St. Joseph’s Prep (Pa.)\nWR: TJ Maddox, Winslow Township (N.J.)\nOT: Bryce Smalls, Archbishop Spalding (Md.)\nOL: Kris Scott, Taft (OH)\nC: Carl Noisette, Duluth (Ga.)\nOL: Maxx Jones, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nOT: Azhir Waddell, Dudley (N.C.)\nAll-Purpose: Deandre Bidden, Harper Woods (Mich.)\n\nEdge: Jalanie George, Desert Edge (Ariz.)\nDT: Kingston Brown, Carver (Ga.) \nDT: Jameer Whyce, Trotwood-Madison (OH)\nEdge: Darieon Prescott, Bolingbrook (IL)\nLB: Tysir Young, Middletown (DE)\nLB: Brayden Bonik, Ridge Point (TX)\nCB: Man Robinson, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nCB: Jermaine Cobbins, Springfield (Tenn.)\nS: Pole Moala, Leuzinger (Calif.)\nS: James Foster III, Lancaster (TX)\n\nPK: Luke Marchionni, Hamilton Southeastern (IN)\nP: Julian Trujillo, Eaglecrest (CO)\nReturn Specialist: Dillon Mitchell, C.E.

    "fullText": "BROOKINGS, S.D. (KELO) — Sunday marked the 19th time the South Dakota State women’s basketball team hosted a nationally-ranked team in the program’s Division-I era, and No. 2 Texas was the highest-ranked foe to ever make the trip to Brookings.\n\nSDSU ultimately fell to the Longhorns 70-51 inside First Bank & Trust Arena, but the Jackrabbits view the experience of playing a Final Four participant from a season ago worthwhile. This year is the fourth straight season the Jacks hosted a ranked team.\n\n“It was just a great opportunity in a lot of ways,” SDSU head coach Aaron Johnston said. “We’ll continue to find chances to play these teams and try and bring them here. We had a great crowd and everybody was into it. It just really I think showed well for where we’re at as a program. But it is hard to play against national championship caliber teams. And that’s really what Texas is.”\n\n“Planning teams like that make us all better,” SDSU senior forward Brooklyn Meyer said. “Obviously they’re long, they’re athletic. It’s good to run our offense and run our plays and stuff like that against a team like that. And so I feel like today was a really good day for growth as a team.”\n\nTexas, now 14-0 this season, saw SDSU as strong preparation for their tough conference slate in the SEC.\n\n“It’s good for us,” Texas head coach Vic Schaefer said. “It’s good for us in getting us ready for the SEC. But it’s also good for the game to grow, the game for our kids to come up here and play in this environment. It’ll help us in the SEC, no doubt about it.”\n\nSDSU is now 9-10 in games against ranked teams in Brookings, but the team will continue to seek these opportunities.\n\n“We’ll continue to move in that direction because I think it helps build our program,” Johnston said. “There’s just absolutely no downside to playing great competition. We’re willing to stretch ourselves. And we’ve learned and grow and learn from it. I think our fans appreciate it. I think our team enjoys it, and we’ll try and keep doing it.”\n\nThe 10-4 Jackrabbits are set to open Summit League play on New Year’s Day against St. Thomas in Brookings.",

    "fullText": "Jacob Rodriguez was sleeping on the floor of his brother’s apartment and learning how to really play defense when he joined Texas Tech for spring practice in 2022, right after a season as a quarterback at Virginia.\n\nSuddenly a walk-on on the other side of the ball, Rodriguez even wondered if he might get cut by the Red Raiders.\n\n\"They’re trying to weed everybody out because it’s coach (Joey) McGuire’s first offseason,\" he said. “So, I'm just out there trying to make the team and then focus on football. It was real weird, totally different position.”\n\nQB-turned-linebacker Rodriguez is now an AP All-American for fourth-ranked Tech, which is in the College Football Playoff for the first time. The team captain with a distinctive mustache, whose wife flies Black Hawk helicopters in the U.S. Army, has a collection of trophies for national defensive player of the year awards, and was fifth in the Heisman Trophy voting. He is the first FBS player in 20 years with at least five forced fumbles (he has seven), two fumble recoveries and four interceptions in the same season.\n\n“He’s just a man of consistency, a man of routine and he’s just a great leader overall,” said Tech senior edge rusher David Bailey, a first-year transfer and also an AP All-America first-teamer.\n\nThe Red Raiders (12-1), in McGuire's fourth season, play No. 5 Oregon (12-1) in the CFP quarterfinal Orange Bowl on New Year's Day. The first-time Big 12 Conference champions already have a school-record 12 wins.\n\nRodriguez won the Chuck Bednarik and Bronko Nagurski awards as the top defensive player, and the Dick Butkus Award as the top linebacker. He got the Lombardi Award that's for exceptional performance while embodying character and discipline like the award's namesake.\n\nRodriguez played a little bit of safety in high school, but when he got to Tech he hadn’t been a linebacker since middle school, when the approach was much different.\n\n“I had no clue what I was doing. I was just going see ball, hit ball,” he said. “You’re playing linebacker, but you don’t have to study film, and you don’t have to understand the position as much.”\n\nAs a prep starting quarterback, Rodriguez accounted for 10,136 total yards (7,085 passing, 3,051 rushing) and 106 touchdowns (68 passing, 38 rushing) as Wichita Falls Rider made the Texas Class 5A playoffs three years in a row. He was then an early enrollee at Virginia, which gave him a scholarship offer as a quarterback. He never threw a pass in his 12 games with the Cavaliers, but had 56 yards rushing and 65 receiving while used as a running back, receiver and tight end. He left there after a coaching change.\n\n“It’s just really cool to see the way that his story has developed, and the kind of guy that he is,” said fifth-year Tech quarterback Behren Morton, a fellow Texan who was in some of the same camps as Rodriguez before college. “He’s probably put on close to 50 pounds, and just totally transformed his body to looking like a mean linebacker.”\n\nRodriguez played special teams and some defensive packages during his Tech debut in 2022, when he had 29 tackles and began to embrace being on that side.\n\n“Really just knowing that I can make an impact whatever position I play. I’ve done it on the offensive side of the ball, I’ve done it on the defensive side of a ball, and I’ve done it on special teams. I can really play with anybody,\" he said. “That’s kind of when I figured I can do this. I saw myself progressing a lot on the defensive side of the ball, and week to week just getting better and better.”\n\nHe was limited to five games in 2023 after injuring his foot in the opener on a play that he forced and recovered a fumble. His 127 tackles last year were the most for a Tech player since Lawrence Flugence set an NCAA FBS record with 193 in 2002. He has 117 this season after Tech reportedly invested more than $7 million on transfers along the defensive front, including Bailey, second-team AP All-America interior lineman A.J. Holmes Jr., and third-teamer Lee Hunter.\n\nAs tough as Rodriguez is, the 6-foot-1, 235-pound linebacker said there is no doubt that his wife Emma is even tougher.\n\nThe high school sweethearts got married in July 2023. Emma graduated from the United States Military Academy and is now based at Fort Riley in Kansas.\n\n\"She's the best, and she does so much for me,\" Jacob Rodriguez said. \"It's weird, I feel like to everybody else, that we do long distance and have done it. But I mean to us, it’s normal. It’s something that we’ve always done.”\n\nWhile disappointed he didn't get an invitation to New York for the Heisman Trophy ceremony, Rodriguez was grateful and honored by the final results. His 17 first-place votes were nine more than Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin, the fourth-place finisher. Indiana QB Fernando Mendoza won the Heisman ahead of Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia and Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love.\n\n“I’m just so appreciative to even be in that conversation,\" Rodriguez said. \"That kind of hit home, was people really cared about me and see what the work that’s been done this year.”\n\nRodriguez has scored three touchdowns this season. He returned a fumble for a score against Oklahoma, and had short rushing TDs on his only carries when taking a direct snap in each of the last two regular-season games.\n\n“It was exciting and it was fun,” he said. “Those are the moments that I’ll never forget, where it’s just having fun playing football.”\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "description": "Duke was the only team inside the top 10 to drop a game last week.",
    "fullText": "It was a pretty quiet week of college basketball, but there was one stunning major upset to carry us through and shake up the top five.\n\nHere’s everything you missed in the seventh week of the regular season, and the latest Associated Press poll.\n\nIt was only a matter of time before Duke slipped, but Saturday night’s loss at Madison Square Garden seemed to come out of nowhere.\n\nThe Blue Devils, who jumped up by 17 points against a shorthanded Texas Tech team in the second half, let the Red Raiders come storming back to pick up an 82-81 upset win. That marked Texas Tech’s first win over a top-five team since 2022, and snapped a six-game losing streak against ranked opponents.\n\nThe win jumped Texas Tech up four spots to No. 15 in this week’s poll.\n\nThe loss, meanwhile, was the first for Duke in what has otherwise been a perfect start to the season. The Blue Devils entered Saturday with a perfect 11-0 record and four wins over ranked opponents — including three straight earlier this month, one over Michigan State and the other over defending national champion Florida.\n\nAs a result, Duke fell three spots to No. 6.\n\nDuke was actually the only team inside the top 10 to lose a game last week. Arizona held onto the No. 1 spot in the polls after a blowout win over San Diego State on Saturday, which got it to 11-0. Michigan remained at No. 2, too, after beating La Salle by 52 points on Sunday. Iowa State moved up a spot to No. 3, UConn took No. 4 and Purdue moved up to No. 5.\n\nWhile it didn’t matter much this time, as they rolled to a blowout win over DePaul, UConn leading scorer Solo Ball missed Sunday’s game with a minor wrist injury. Ball has averaged a team-high 15.4 points per game, and was fresh off a 26-point outing against Butler.\n\nThe next big loss came when Tennessee rolled over Louisville by 21 points on Tuesday, which snapped a three-game losing skid for the Vols. That launched them up to No. 19, while Louisville fell to No. 16.\n\nUnfortunately, we’re looking at a very slow week of college basketball ahead. The sport is largely taking a break over Christmas. So enjoy the time, and get ready for conference play to kick off across the board on the other side.\n\nAll times ET | * denotes neutral site\n\nMissouri at No. 20 Illinois | 8 p.m. | FS1 *\n\nThe full Associated Press men’s basketball poll from December 22, 2025.\n\n1.

She has previously resided in London, Paris, Palm Beach, and New York City. It was on the Upper East Side in the 1990s that Maxwell met Jeffrey Epstein and the two bonded over shared interests: social climbing and exploiting young women. Epstein provided the funding while Maxwell did the recruiting. Victims have testified that Maxwell trolled Florida spas looking to recruit teenagers to massage Epstein, reassuring high schoolers in her clipped British accent that nothing untoward would occur.",

    "title": "Remembering Richard Bell, Texas Tech football defensive coordinator",
    "description": "Texas Tech football has a defense for the ages this season. The architect of the Red Raiders' next best defenses, Richard Bell, died this month.",
    "fullText": "The Texas Tech football team's average yield of 10.92 points per game this season would be a school record for scoring defense in the modern era, defined by the National Football Foundation as 1950 and later.\n\nOver the past 60 years, Tech's next five stingiest defenses by average points allowed came in the five consecutive seasons from 1970-74. Those are the years Richard Bell was the Red Raiders' defensive coordinator, or head defensive coach, as he was commonly referenced.\n\n\"Oh, wow,\" said Tommy Cones, a Red Raiders defensive end who lettered from 1972-74. \"Well, that tells you a lot right there. Numbers don't lie, right?\"\n\n\"That's amazing. That's amazing,\" said Gaines Baty, a defensive end who lettered from 1970-72. \"Well, he was known across the country as a defensive expert.\"\n\nBell died on Dec. 13 in Woodstock, Georgia. He was 88.\n\nMore: Texas Tech football's Jacob Rodriguez on Heisman vote, awards circuit\n\nHis passing prompted reflection among those who played under him.\n\n\"Richard Bell was the epitome of character, integrity, intensity, passion and excellence,\" Baty said. \"He set a high standard for the football team, as well as personally for every player on that team.\"\n\nBell came to Texas Tech from West Virginia with head coach Jim Carlen in 1970 and followed Carlen to South Carolina after the 1974 season. Tech and Vanderbilt played to a 6-6 tie in the Peach Bowl on Dec. 28, 1974, before Vandy coach Steve Sloan switched programs. Late on New Year's Eve, Sloan announced he was staying at Vanderbilt, but he changed his mind and accepted the Texas Tech job on New Year's Day.\n\nThe next day, the Avalanche-Journal reported Bell, according to Texas Tech insiders, \"would have landed the job had Sloan not reconsidered during the wee hours of New Year's morn.\"\n\nBell was a college head coach for only one year, going 4-7 in 1982 at South Carolina.\n\nHis long coaching career included stints as defensive coordinator at West Virginia (1968-69), Texas Tech (1970-74), South Carolina (1975-81), Duke (1983-87), East Carolina (1988), Georgia (1989-93), Navy (1994) and Air Force (1995-2006). The Arkansas native was a captain on Frank Broyles' first Razorbacks team in 1958 and made early coaching stops at Virginia Military (1962-63) and Georgia Tech (1964-67).\n\nHe worked under College Football Hall of Fame coaches Bobby Dodd and Fisher DeBerry at Georgia Tech and Air Force, respectively, and alongside Hall of Fame coach Bobby Bowden when Bowden was offensive coordinator at West Virginia.\n\nBefore leaving Georgia, Bell recruited a young defensive back named Kirby Smart.\n\n\"He just knew how to get the most out of every player,\" Cones said, \"and he had some really, really good pep talks. He was such a professional in terms of communicating, and you'd get really pumped up when he's your coach. He had a certain charisma about him. He would say the right thing, the things you wanted to hear before you went out to win a game for him.\"\n\nFormer Tech defensive tackle David Knaus described Bell as calm, controlled, thorough and confident. Knaus, an all-Southwest Conference honoree in 1973, said Bell's style was a polar opposite of Bill Parcells, who followed him as Tech defensive coordinator.\n\n\"Other than both of them being tremendous coaches, they couldn't have been more different in their styles,\" Knaus said. \"As an example, I never heard profanity ever uttered from coach Bell. He barely ever needed to raise his voice. It was always controlled correction.\"\n\nTech went 8-4 in 1970, holding opponents to 13.5 points per game. The Red Raiders slipped to 4-7 in 1971, though the defense yielded only 12.5 points per game, and defensive back Marc Dove was Southwest Conference defensive player of the year. Bell's units held opponents to 14.2 points per game in 1972, 15.3 in 1973 and 13.8 in 1974.\n\nThe 1972 team finished 8-4 with a Sun Bowl loss to North Carolina. The 1973 team finished 11-1 with a Gator Bowl conquest of Tennessee.\n\nWhile serving as the Red Raiders' defensive coordinator, Bell was position coach for defensive ends and linebackers. End Bruce Dowdy earned all-Southwest Conference recognition in 1970, linebacker Larry Molinare in 1971 and Cones in 1974.\n\n\"He took a lot of running backs and good athletes,\" Baty said, \"and turned them into linebackers and defensive ends. That was kind of his way to do it. He liked a good athlete that would hit you.\"\n\nBaty came to Tech as a running back, quickly moved to linebacker and then played his entire varsity career at defensive end. Noseguard Don Rives was a second-team all-American in 1972. In the spring before that season, Rives called Baty \"the best defensive end in this league\" and \"the most underrated player in this conference.\"\n\nTo the extent that was true, Baty chalked it up to his coach.\n\n\"He made me as a player,\" Baty said. \"Not that I was anything special, but whatever I was is because of Richard Bell.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Lubbock Avalanche-Journal: Remembering Richard Bell, Texas Tech football defensive coordinator",

Nationwide, thousands of local and state police recruits are allowed into the profession only after passing similar drills – simulated fights for their lives.\n\nThe barrage of force against Sterling came rapidly, video obtained by The Associated Press shows. A surprise push from behind threw her to the floor. A right-handed punch to the back of the head knocked her down. Within two minutes, she was struck at least seven times in the head, the last blow knocking off her wrestling helmet.\n\n“Protect yourself!” an instructor yelled.\n\nSterling completed the drill but suffered a concussion. A dozen of her classmates — a third in all — were injured that day as they were repeatedly punched, tackled on a gym floor and thrown against padded walls, records show.\n\nWhile the drill was physically punishing, their experience was not unique. Since 2005, similar drills at law enforcement academies nationwide have been linked to at least a dozen deaths and hundreds of injuries, some resulting in disability, an AP investigation has found.\n\nEditor’s note: This is the third installment of AP’s Dying to Serve series. Find the previous stories here and here.\n\nThe drills — frequently referred to as RedMan training for the brand and color of protective gear worn by participants – are intended to teach law enforcement recruits how to defend themselves against combative suspects. They’re among the most challenging tests at police academies. Law enforcement experts say that when properly designed and supervised, they teach new officers critical skills for handling high-stress situations.\n\nBut critics say they can put recruits at risk of physical and mental abuse that runs some promising officers out of the profession. Academies have wide latitude in running such exercises, given a lack of national standards governing police training.\n\nSterling quit the academy after her drill. She's now speaking out, hoping to spark change in training practices nationwide.\n\n“I’m worried that someone is going to get killed,” said Sterling, who'd previously worked as a senior game warden and defensive tactics instructor in Wyoming. “This is a poorly disguised assault.”\n\nAn investigation by the agency that regulates law enforcement training found no wrongdoing in how the drill was conducted. An academy official told investigators the goal was to “overwhelm the cadet physically and mentally to force them to think while physically exhausted.”\n\nAn expert who reviewed the case told AP injuries happen during volatile training environments nationwide, but the Texas drill stood out for its design — recruits could not use force to defend themselves against the onslaught of assailants. He said the number of injuries was concerning.\n\n“To teach cadets how and when to defend themselves, only to put them in a doomsday scenario with the instruction that they’re not allowed to fight back, does not match any training curriculum I’ve seen,” said David Jude, a retired Kentucky State Police academy commander.\n\nA Wyoming game warden moves back to Texas\n\nIn October 2024, Sterling started the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department’s eight-month academy in rural central Texas, which boasts of producing “the best-trained conservation officers in the country.”\n\nGame wardens — called conservation officers or wildlife troopers in some states — enforce hunting and fishing laws. They carry firearms, have arrest powers, are often among the first to respond to emergencies and rescue missions.\n\nSterling said she loved serving as a game warden for nearly five years in Wyoming, where she sometimes shooed moose and mountain lions away from towns. Patrolling without backup, she said, she had some “very tense conversations” with suspects and had to restrain some in handcuffs.\n\nShe said almost everyone she encountered during hunting season was armed and potentially dangerous, but she prided herself on responding alertly and calmly. She never had to fight a suspect, and none of the 40 wardens she taught self-defense had been in a significant use-of-force incident.\n\nSterling applied in Texas to live closer to family, hoping for a similar law-enforcement role in her home state. She grew up as the daughter of a Dallas police officer and ran track and cross-country at Texas A&M.\n\nThe academy scheduled the four-on-one drill for Dec. 13, 2024, after five weeks of arrest and control training.\n\nInstructors told cadets they couldn't defend themselves and were only to punch and kick a shield held by instructors, Sterling recalled. They discussed how some cadets had been seriously injured and terminated from previous academies for performing poorly.\n\nSterling told AP she was confused by the drill’s purpose. She'd never been ambushed by one person, let alone four. If that happened, she’d be able to use a firearm or other force to defend herself. As an instructor, she said, she would have never approved such a scenario or allowed punches to the head and neck.\n\nA female classmate who had previously worked as a police officer resigned rather than participate. She later told investigators she saw the drill as inappropriate and part of an academy culture of unprofessional training and hazing.\n\nBut Sterling felt she had no choice if she wanted to stay in her profession. She completed a cardio exercise, and the drill began.\n\nCombat drills take various forms nationwide\n\nAcademies have discretion to design training within state guidelines, and AP found the drills take many forms at local police, county sheriff and state departments. They’re sometimes called “combat training,” “Fight Day” or “stress reaction training.”\n\nRecruits like Sterling must ward off several assailants at once. Others fight a series of instructors, one after another. Some academies intentionally use larger, more skilled instructors. In Kentucky, one scenario requires fighting a combative suspect in a pool.\n\nThe stated goals are generally the same: to use skills learned in the academy to fend off or subdue assailants and to never give up.\n\nRecruits and instructors wear protective gear to cushion their heads from blows. But there are no uniform safety guidelines, including whether academies must have medical personnel on site.\n\nLawyers for some Black and female former trainees have alleged that instructors targeted their clients with excessive force to try to run them out of the profession. Several of the deaths have been of Black men hoping to join disproportionately white police forces.\n\nAmid the deaths and criticism, experts are encouraging academy directors to retire or modify any problematic drills.\n\nThe drills “can quickly devolve into abusive rites of passage” without appropriate focus and oversight, said Brian Baxter, who oversaw training at the Texas Department of Public Safety and now leads a group that studies the use of force. Some instructors want to win rather than allow recruits to practice their skills, he added.\n\n“The idea that we’re just punching each other to see who’s toughest ... that’s when it becomes inappropriate,” said Baxter, whose former agency overhauled its practices after a trooper died in 2005 from getting hit several times in the head. “There needs to be a problem that’s being solved by this training. And that problem needs to be directly related to public service.”\n\nFor this Texas academy class, injuries were widespread\n\nFor Sterling, the drill came to an end when she simulated holding her assailants at gunpoint and put them in handcuffs.\n\nLater that day, she had a pounding headache. Her knee swelled, and she’d skinned her elbow on the floor.\n\nAt least 13 of 37 cadets reported injuries: concussion symptoms; a fractured wrist; a torn MCL; sprained wrists and knees; a bruised nose, records show.\n\nTwo recruits needed surgery. Some were told the injuries were due to their lack of preparation and poor technique, and had to redo the drill.\n\nSterling said she wasn't offered medical care. She recalled vomiting while driving herself for emergency treatment. A doctor found she suffered a concussion that resulted from an assault, a medical record provided by Sterling shows.\n\nSterling had passed the drill, but turned in her resignation.\n\n“I have a very high sense of what is right and what is wrong,\" she told AP. \"I did not want to be part of what was happening at the academy anymore.”\n\nDeaths and injuries across the country\n\nNationwide, deaths and injuries have been blamed on a mix of trauma from punches and other force, overexertion, heat stroke, dehydration, and organ failure.\n\nIn August, 30-year-old Jon-Marques Psalms died two days after a training exercise at the San Francisco Police Academy. He suffered a head injury while fighting an instructor in a padded suit.\n\nAn autopsy found his death was an accident caused by complications of muscle and organ damage “in the setting of a high-intensity training exercise.” His family has filed a legal claim against the city and hired experts for a second autopsy.\n\nIn November 2024, a 24-year-old Kentucky game warden recruit died after fighting an instructor in a pool to the point of collapse, video obtained by AP shows. William Bailey’s death was ruled an accidental drowning due to a “sudden cardiac dysrhythmia during physical exertion.”\n\nA year earlier, a Denver police recruit had both legs amputated after a training fight that his attorney called a “barbaric hazing ritual.” An Indiana recruit died of exertion after he was pummeled by a larger instructor, and a classmate was disabled after fighting the same man.\n\nInvestigations of Austin’s police academy in Texas found that physical and psychological abuse from such exercises resulted in “a significant number” of cadets injured, ranging from dehydration to broken bones, and led to reforms. Black and female cadets represented a disproportionate number of those who were injured and quit.\n\nMacho Products Inc., which sells RedMan Training Gear nationwide, cautions in its warranty that such training “always presents risks of accidental injury, disability, and death that must be assumed by all participants.\" The document says risks can be minimized through “carefully planned scenarios conducted at appropriate levels of force.” A company spokesperson didn’t respond to AP's request for comment on recent deaths and injuries.\n\nFormer cadet compares the drill to a gang initiation ritual\n\nAlarmed by the injuries to Sterling and others, a state lawmaker's office contacted the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement to seek an investigation.\n\nAfter reviewing videos, investigating the injuries, and interviewing instructors and some recruits, the investigation found the drill was conducted in a “control and organized manner, with safety measures in place and training objectives clearly communicated.” The videos did not show instructors acting overly aggressive to Sterling, or any other “actions that were inappropriate or inconsistent with the established training guidelines,” it found.\n\n“While multiple cadets sustained minor to moderate injuries during the drill, the majority recovered without extended medical consequences or changes to their training status,\" the report said.\n\nThe Texas Parks and Wildlife Department declined to comment and refused to release records, citing the potential for litigation.\n\nSterling, who has returned to Wyoming and still works in law enforcement, was outraged by the state's defense of the drill, which she compared to a gang initiation ritual.\n\n“New members are physically beaten down by the gang membership,” she said, “which now considers you as its property.”",

The Eagles then started this season 0-2 with losses to Creekside (Ga.) and North Crowley.\n\nBut they’ve rounded more into form from there, winning 12 of their next 13 contests, with the only defeat in that span to Duncanville, which played for the 6A Division I championship earlier on Saturday.\n\nDeSoto avenged last season’s playoff defeat to Longview by beating the Lobos in the area round, 60-28. The Eagles have scored at least 56 points in all five playoff wins, including last week, when they rallied in the second half to defeat previously undefeated Southlake Carroll, 57-44.\n\nSheldon King enters its first state championship game at 13-2. The Panthers’ lone two defeats came to Dickinson, which reached the 6A DI regional finals, and Galena Park North Shore, which played for the 6A DI title earlier on Saturday.\n\nIn the playoffs, King scored at least 50 points in its first three games. Two weeks ago, in the regional final round, the Panthers got past Humble Summer Creek, 24-21, before downing defending 6A DII state champion Austin Vandegrift, 58-41, in the semifinals last week.\n\nNow, in the final game of the 2025 Texas high school football season, King wants to conclude things with its first title while DeSoto attempts to continue a dynastic run.\n\nFollow The Sporting News correspondent Buck Ringgold (@Bucks_Ballpark) for all of the live updates and scoring from Arlington.\n\nScroll down for live score and game updates from kickoff to the postgame.

Future filings will also be released to the public after the Paxtons and a coalition of media outlets came to an agreement.\n\n“It’s a victory, I think, for the American public and for the Texas voters,” Tyler Bexley, an attorney for the media intervenors, told reporters after the judge ordered the documents unsealed.\n\nThe divorce and the surrounding speculation have only fueled attacks against Paxton in one of the nation’s most heated Republican primaries as he seeks to unseat Sen. John Cornyn. Whether the divorce details resonate with voters remains to be seen, with the Senate primary set for March 3. Despite years of controversy, the three-term attorney general has remained competitive in the race, which includes Rep. Wesley Hunt.\n\nThe divorce comes after 38 years of marriage, during which Angela Paxton had supported her husband through a series of legal troubles, including state and federal corruption investigations. A state securities fraud indictment against Ken Paxton was dismissed after a 2024 plea deal in which he agreed to pay restitution and complete community service, and the Justice Department dropped a federal corruption probe earlier this year.\n\nAngela Paxton also stood by Ken Paxton's side during that impeachment trial, which publicly exposed an extramarital affair. The 2023 impeachment trial ended in an acquittal for him.\n\nPaxton’s support in Texas has remained strong amid a decade of legal troubles. He won reelection in 2022 by nearly 10 percentage points.\n\nPaxton launched his bid to unseat Cornyn in April and has since drawn attacks from Senate Republicans’ campaign arm, with some in the party concerned that while Paxton could prevail in the GOP primary, he may complicate the general election and force national Republicans to spend heavily to hold the seat. On the Democratic side, U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett and state Rep. James Talarico are facing off in their party’s primary.\n\nGroups supporting Cornyn have spent more than $21 million on television ads this year, according to AdImpact, to promote the four-term senator and attack Paxton.\n\n“What Ken Paxton has put his family through is truly repulsive and disgusting,” National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesperson Joanna Rodriguez said in July. “No one should have to endure what Angela Paxton has, and we pray for her as she chooses to stand up for herself and her family during this difficult time.”\n\nPaxton has been a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, while Cornyn has at times drawn criticism within his own party for working with Democrats. Trump’s endorsement is expected to be a decisive factor in Texas, which he won in 2024 by nearly 14 percentage points. Trump has not yet endorsed in the race.\n\nJudge Robert Brotherton approved the agreement on Friday to release the records, which had been sealed following a request by Angela Paxton shortly after she filed. Another judge signed the agreed order to seal the records. In a filing after media outlets and the nonprofit Campaign for Accountability intervened to have the documents unsealed, Ken Paxton said he was opposed to the documents being publicly released.\n\nBexley said Friday that the media outlets he represents believe that voters have the right to know information about the case as “they are making decisions in the upcoming elections.”\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of Ken Paxton at https://apnews.com/hub/ken-paxton.",

The surge reflects escalating revenue streams, including media rights, sponsorships and the expanding impact of name, image and likeness (NIL) deals for student-athletes.\n\nTexas A&M retains the No. 3 spot at roughly $1.32 billion, while Georgia and Michigan round out the top five, each valued at about $1.16 billion. Notre Dame is sixth at $1.13 billion, followed by Tennessee at $1.12 billion and USC at $1.10 billion.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nARLINGTON, TEXAS - Two teams that have won state titles this century face off Friday morning for the chance to claim more hardware.\n\nStephenville and Kilgore square off at AT&T Stadium in the Texas University Interscholastic League 4A Division I championship game.\n\nLIVE STREAM:Victory+ (Victory Plus) will stream for free all 12 UIL state championship games.\n\nIn Stephenville’s case, the Yellow Jackets are trying to continue a trend. They have made the state title game for the seventh time in program history, and in the previous six, they have won it all, winning in 1993, 1994, 1998, 1999, 2012 and 2021.\n\nStephenville enters Friday’s latest title tilt at 15-0 overall. Among the Jackets’ wins was a 28-12 regular-season decision against Ruston (La.), which played in last week’s Louisiana Non-Select Division I title game.\n\nLast week, Stephenville got a field goal in the final seconds to upend defending state champion Celina, 24-21.\n\nThis is Kilgore’s second straight trip to the title game, having lost to Celina last season. Kilgore’s first championship game appearance was in 2004, and the Bulldogs claimed the title that season, and they also returned in 2013.\n\nKilgore dropped its season opener to Carthage - which is playing for the 4A Division II championship later on Friday - but have reeled off 14 straight wins, the latest a 49-0 win against La Vernia in last week’s semifinal round.\n\nFollow The Sporting News correspondent Buck Ringgold (@Bucks_Ballpark) for all of the live updates and scoring from Arlington.\n\nScroll down for live score and game updates from kickoff to the postgame. Refresh this page for the latest.\n\n- Kilgore will force Stephenville to punt as we have reached the two-minute warning.\n\n- INTERCEPTION STEPHENVILLE. Whatchoo talkin' bout, Willis? Willis Jackson makes a diving grab in the end zone for Stephenville's third takeaway on the day, stopping Kilgore's potential drive. Still scoreless with 2:37 left in the half.\n\n- Stephenville is called for a personal foul penalty, and Kilgore now has a first-and-goal at the Jackets' 7-yard line with less than five minutes to go in the half.\n\n- On a third down play, Kilgore QB Kayson Brooks finds receiver Tyler Johnigan along the sideline and Johnigan is able to move forward for a first down near the Stephenville 20.\n\n- FUMBLE RECOVERY KILGORE. Ball falls out on a running play, and Kilgore's Bi'syn Williams is there to scoop it up and he has a long return to just past midfield in Stephenville territory with 7:02 left in the half. First takeaway for the Ragin' Red defense.\n\n- Stephenville converts a fourth down as Trot Jordan finds Adan Jergins for a gain inside the Kilgore 30. We are under nine minutes to go in the half.\n\n- Stephenville had 46 yards of total offense in the first quarter, while Kilgore had 45. But the Jackets have already forced two turnovers.\n\nUIL 4A Div. I Championship\n\nEnd 1: Kilgore 0, Stephenville 0. pic.twitter.com/Ca0gdizc7Y\n\n— KTBS Sports (@KTBS_Sports) December 19, 2025\n\n- Kilgore throws an incomplete pass on third down and will punt it away. The ball bounces all the way to the Stephenville 28-yard line as the opening quarter comes to an end.\n\n- Stephenville reaches the Kilgore 25 before the drive stalls. Jackets try a 41-yard field goal, but the kick is short. Bulldogs take over with 1:38 left in the quarter.\n\n- Stephenville converts on a fourth down just past midfield on a short run from Zyler McClendon with more than five minutes to go in the half.\n\n- FUMBLE RECOVERY STEPHENVILLE. Stephenville gets its second takeaway, as the Jackets forced a fumble and recovered it. After a lengthy replay review, the ruling is upheld. Hudson Butchee, who earlier had the interception, forced the fumble, and teammate Cooper Fergeson landed on it near the Stephenville 45.\n\n- Another third-down chance for Stephenville but a pass is overthrown. Jackets go for it on fourth down, but Kilgore linebacker Isaiah Watters brings down quarterback Trot Jordan for a loss. Bulldogs take over at their 41 with 7:25 left in the opening period.\n\n- Stephenville tailback Zyler McClendon picks up a first down on a third-down play. Jackets have the ball near Kilgore's 35.\n\n- INTERCEPTION STEPHENVILLE. Kilgore makes a first down on its opening drive, but on a third-down play, a pass gets picked off by the Jackets' Hudson Butchee right at midfield. Stephenville on offense for the first time today.\n\n.@ButcheeHudson with an early takeaway for Stephenville!\n\nThe senior LB picks off Kayson Brooks on the game's first drive at #UILState.https://t.co/wKSaNdPjA2@SvilleYJFB | #TXHSFBpic.twitter.com/FmslEbwm6d\n\n— Dave Campbell's — TexasFootball.com (@dctf) December 19, 2025\n\n- Toe meets leather and we are under way at AT&T. Kilgore fields the kickoff near its own 20 and brings it out to the 30. But an illegal block penalty moves the ball back to the 20.\n\n- Kilgore has won the toss and has elected to receive. So Stephenville will kick off to start this contest.\n\n- Stephenville is the visiting team and they are wearing navy blue helmets, white jerseys and white pants.

    "description": "Texas Pacific Land has generated substantial returns for long-term investors as Permian Basin oil and gas production has surged.",
    "fullText": "Texas Pacific Land is a high-margin cash cow.\n\nIts land is valuable because it's located in the largest oil-and-gas-producing region in the United States.\n\nThe company is one of the safest ways to invest in growing oil and gas production.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Texas Pacific Land ›\n\nNetflix captured the spotlight in November when it executed its long-awaited 10-for-1 stock split. With just two weeks left in 2025, many investors probably figure they'll have to wait for 2026 for more high-profile splits.\n\nEarlier this month, S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) component Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE: TPL) announced a 3-for-1 stock split. Trading of the split-adjusted shares will take place on Dec. 23.\n\nHere's why Texas Pacific is no ordinary oil and gas company and why the high-margin cash cow could be an excellent gift for your portfolio this December.\n\nTexas Pacific's stock split will triple the number of shares outstanding while reducing the share price by two-thirds, making it easier for investors to buy one full share of the company at around $280 per share. This compares to around $840 per share at the time of this writing.\n\nStock splits can indicate that management is confident in a company's future earnings growth and thus, a higher future stock price. Even though stock splits don't impact a company's value or market capitalization, they're still generally received favorably by investors.\n\nWhat makes Texas Pacific's split particularly interesting is that the stock is down 24.1% year to date -- but stock splits tend to occur after a stock has run up in price. To make matters even more interesting, the company issued a 3-for-1 stock split in March 2024.\n\nIt's incredibly rare for a company to issue stock splits in back-to-back years, but Texas Pacific more than doubled last year, has crushed the S&P 500 over the last five years, and is up 18-fold over the last decade. There are plenty of reasons to believe it has a long runway for future earnings growth.\n\nThe oil and gas industry is capital-intensive. Upstream exploration and production companies are the most sensitive to fluctuations in oil and gas prices. Midstream companies, which transport and store hydrocarbons, tend to have less price sensitivity due to long-term contracts but are incredibly capital-intensive and depend on growing demand to justify infrastructure spending. Similarly, the margins of downstream refining and marketing companies can fluctuate based on input costs, such as oil prices and the cyclical demand for refined products.",

    "description": "Taking a look at the 2025 Miami Hurricanes and Texas A&M Aggies as Ohio State awaits winner for Cotton Bowl showdown.",
    "fullText": "The Ohio State Buckeyes are gearing up to face either the Miami Hurricanes or the Texas A&M Aggies in just under two weeks in a College Football Playoff Cotton Bowl quarterfinal. Ohio State would be favored against either opponent, but both bring distinct challenges and would pose legitimate tests on a big stage.\n\nAs it stands, Texas A&M is a 3.5-point favorite over Miami, with that matchup set to be played on the Aggies’ home field. That raises an obvious question: who would the Buckeyes rather see across the sideline? And who exactly are the 2025 Hurricanes and Aggies?\n\nTo answer that, let’s take a closer look at how each team’s season has unfolded so far, breaking down their strengths, weaknesses, and what Ohio State can realistically expect from either opponent on New Year’s night in Arlington at 7:30 p.m. ET.\n\nMiami is a fascinating case study, and I think they are quietly one of the stronger CFP teams in the 2025 bracket. The Hurricanes opened the season with a statement win over Notre Dame, a result that ultimately played a major role in punching their ticket to the Playoff. They followed that up with five straight victories before stumbling against a feisty Louisville team, 24–21, in a game where quarterback Carson Beck threw four interceptions.\n\nMiami bounced back with a blowout win over Stanford, only to suffer another setback the following week in an overtime loss to SMU, again plagued by turnovers as Beck tossed two interceptions. From that point on, however, the Hurricanes flipped the switch. They won every remaining game by 17 points or more, and Beck threw just one interception over the final four contests.\n\nOffensively, Miami ranks No. 27 nationally in total offense and features playmakers across the board. Running back Mark Fletcher is a reliable and physical runner who finished with 10 rushing touchdowns while averaging 4.9 yards per carry. The wide receiver room is deep and diverse, highlighted by BYU transfer Keelan Marion, LSU transfer CJ Daniels, and freshman phenom Malachi Toney. Toney has been electric, leading the team in receptions with 84, yards with 970, and tying for the team lead in receiving touchdowns with seven. The real engine of this offense is the offensive line. As expected under head coach Mario Cristobal, the foundation of this unit is built up front. Beck has been sacked just nine times all season, and both the run and pass games have consistently operated in clean pockets and wide-open lanes.\n\nDefensively, Miami has been just as impressive. The Hurricanes rank No. 11 nationally, allowing only 19 touchdowns and an average of 277.8 yards per game. Miami is built to control the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball, and the centerpiece is defensive lineman Rueben Bain Jr., a projected top-10 pick in April’s NFL Draft and one of the most dominant pass rushers in the country. Bain combines elite power, quick hands, and a deep pass-rush arsenal to overwhelm offensive linemen in both the run and pass game.\n\nMiami also invested heavily in its secondary this past offseason, and the payoff has been clear. The Hurricanes boast two cornerbacks with four interceptions apiece, while the linebackers do a solid job of keeping plays in front of them and limiting explosive gains. The defensive line is special, and the back end is more than capable of capitalizing on the pressure it creates.\n\nIf Beck stays clean and makes sound decisions in the pocket, especially by limiting turnovers, Miami becomes a difficult out. They control the trenches, protect their quarterback, and feature difference-makers on both sides of the ball.\n\nNot long ago, Texas A&M was viewed as part of the sport’s top tier, grouped with teams like Ohio State and Indiana, and even discussed by some fans and analysts as the best team in the country. Now, the Aggies enter the postseason as the No. 7 seed, carrying more questions after closing the regular season with a loss to Texas.\n\nLike Miami, A&M owns a narrow shootout win over Notre Dame, beating the Irish by one point in Week 3. The rest of the season, however, was filled with blowouts and close calls. The Aggies survived Auburn at home by six points, outlasted Arkansas 45–42, and escaped South Carolina 31–30 before their undefeated run ended with a 10-point loss to the Longhorns in Week 12. Head coach Mike Elko deserves credit for navigating those tight spots, but Texas A&M also exposed some real vulnerabilities along the way, particularly at quarterback.\n\nMarcel Reed is a dynamic talent, but he dealt with turnover issues similar to Miami’s Carson Beck. Reed finished the season with 10 interceptions and three fumbles, mistakes that often put the Aggies in early holes. Still, his ability to flip a game on its head is undeniable. The South Carolina matchup is the perfect example. A&M trailed 30–3 at halftime, with Reed already responsible for two interceptions and a fumble. In the second half, he caught fire, finishing with 439 yards and three touchdowns to engineer a stunning comeback victory.\n\nOffensively, Texas A&M ranks 20th in total offense and features a receiver group that mirrors Miami’s in both depth and talent. NC State transfer KC Concepcion, a likely first-round pick, Mississippi State transfer Mario Craver, and freshman Ashton Bethel-Roman form the core of the passing attack. Together, they accounted for 18 of Reed’s 25 passing touchdowns. On the ground, the Aggies deploy a true three-headed monster in Rueben Owens II, Le’Veon Moss, and Reed himself. All three averaged more than five yards per carry and scored at least five rushing touchdowns. As with Miami, the offensive line is a major strength. Reed was sacked just 10 times all season, and the fact that four different runners averaged over five yards per carry on at least 41 attempts is staggering.\n\nDefensively, Texas A&M ranks No. 19 nationally and features one of the most disruptive pass rushers in the country in Cashius Howell, who recorded 11.5 sacks in 2025. The Aggies totaled 41 sacks as a team and recovered six fumbles, though they managed just three interceptions. The defensive line consistently pressures quarterbacks, but the unit has shown vulnerability against explosive offenses, both on the ground and through the air. That inconsistency showed up in games where A&M surrendered 40 points to Notre Dame, 42 to Arkansas, 25 to LSU, and 30 to South Carolina. The defense is solid, but far from lockdown.\n\nWith Marcel Reed under center, Texas A&M always has a puncher’s chance. The Aggies have the firepower to go blow-for-blow with anyone in the country, and their defense has a knack for generating timely sacks in critical moments. If Reed stays protected and cuts down on mistakes, this is a dangerous team capable of catching fire at the right time.\n\nI view Miami and Texas A&M as very similar teams, and Ohio State should expect both offenses to prioritize establishing the run to set up explosive plays downfield with their dynamic wide receivers. On the defensive side, each will likely take a page from Indiana’s game plan against the Buckeyes by dialing up creative blitz packages, testing the Ohio State offensive line, and trying to make Julian Sayin uncomfortable in the pocket.\n\nI have Miami pulling out a win in College Station, largely because I trust Carson Beck to avoid a turnover-heavy performance. Texas A&M is tied for 128th nationally in interceptions forced, one of the worst marks in the country. If Beck limits his mistakes to fewer than two turnovers, I think Miami comes out on top.\n\nOhio State will be patiently waiting to see who emerges from this matchup, with the Cotton Bowl looming just over a week away.\n\nContact/Follow us @BuckeyesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Ohio State news, notes, and opinion.

    "fullText": "Texas A&M (11-1, 7-1 SEC) is less than 24 hours away from hosting Miami (10-2) in the first round of the College Football Playoff. After losing to rival Texas on the road almost a month ago, the Aggies have had plenty of time to fix their remaining issues and prepare to face one of the more complete teams in the country on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThroughout the month, the health status of senior running back Le'Veon Moss has been the primary talking point, knowing that the Aggies would have likely finished 12-0 with a chance at an SEC Championship if Moss had not been injured against Florida in late October.\n\nWith an ankle injury, head coach Mike Elko has kept things under wraps for the most part, while confirming on Wednesday that he remains in \"wait-and-see mode\" regarding his star back's status. However, the first official injury report, which was released on Wednesday, designated Moss as \"questionable\" with a 50% chance to play, coupled with linebacker Scooby Williams and safety Bryce Anderson as \"probable\" with a 75% chance to take the field.\n\nOn Thursday night, just minutes after Texas A&M's Volleyball team swept No. 1 Pitt 3-0 to earn its first trip to the National Championship Game, the latest injury report revealed good news for the Aggies, as Williams and Anderson were not included in the injury report, while Moss remains questionable.\n\nGetting both defenders back is great news for Texas A&M's run defense, which has struggled early in games. For what it's worth, a Texas A&M student who reportedly spoke with Le'Veon Moss on Saturday during the senior's graduation ceremony stated, \"Moss is a go!\"\n\nTexas A&M will host Miami on Saturday at 11:00 a.m. with coverage on ABC and ESPN.\n\nThursday's update of the CFP Student-Athlete Availability Report ahead of Saturday's first-round matchup between #7 Texas A&M and #10 Miami: pic.twitter.com/0KszoWObum\n\n— TexAgs (@TexAgs) December 19, 2025\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M LB Scooby Williams, S Bryce Anderson available vs. Miami",

    "fullText": "The field of 64 teams in the 2025 NCAA volleyball tournament is down to the championship with the No. 1 Kentucky Wildcats and No. 3 seed Texas A&M Aggies remaining. They will face off in the first all-SEC national championship game on Sunday, Dec. 21 (3:30 p.m. ET, ABC) at the T-Mobile Center in Kansas City.\n\nTexas A&M is looking to take its best season in program history even further. The Aggies are vying for their first title in their first championship appearance after upsetting No. 1 overall seed Nebraska and No. 1 Pitt in the Elite Eight and Final Four, respectively. Meanwhile, Kentucky is looking to win its second title and first since 2020 after getting past No. 3 Wisconsin in a thrilling five-set semifinal win.\n\nHere's a preview of the national championship, including lineups and X-factors to keep an eye on:\n\nNo. 3 Texas A&M will face off against No. 1 Kentucky in the national championship game on on Sunday, Dec. 21 (3:30 p.m. ET, ABC) at T-Mobile Center in Kansas City.\n\n6 Kassie O'Brien | S 6-1 - Freshman\n\n10 Kennedy Washington | MB 6-0 - Sophomore\n\n11 Molly Berezowitz | DS 5-5 - Junior\n\n12 Molly Tuozzo | L 5-7 - Junior\n\n15 Lizzie Carr | MB 6-6 - Redshirt Junior\n\n17 Brooklyn DeLeye | OH 6-2 - Junior\n\nIt's unusual to list an AVCA First-team All-American as an X-factor, but Brooklyn Deleye's performance will be paramount against the streaking Aggies. Kentucky got off to a slow start in the first set of their Final Four win over No. 3 Wisconsin — suffering their worst deficit in a set since 2018 — due in part to Deleye's early struggles. She hit 15 kills on 50 total attempts, but her dismal .160 hitting percentage marked her third-lowest of the season. The Wildcats and Deleye must come out strong in the national championship and cannot afford to get behind the Aggies.\n\n37 Kyndal Stowers | OH 5-11 - Sophomore\n\n1 Ifenna Cos-Okpalla | MB 6-2 - Senior\n\n2 Addi Applegate | L/DS 5-5 - Freshman\n\n9 Logan Lednicky | OPP 6-3 - Senior\n\n12 Ava Underwood | L/DS 5-7 - Senior\n\n16 Maddie Waak | S 5-10 - Senior\n\nIfenna Cos-Okpalla is a 2025 AVCA First-Team All-American for a reason.

    "description": "Arkansas State completes mission of winning season and unlocks a new achievement in Frisco, TX.",
    "fullText": "Arkansas State unlocked a significant achievement Thursday night in Frisco, TX.\n\nThe Red Wolves emerged victorious in the inaugural Xbox Bowl, taking down first-year FBS program Missouri State 34-28 in the first college football game played at the Ford Center inside The Star — the practice facility of the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nImmediately after Master Chief from Halo handled the coin toss, Arkansas State wasted no time in completing a successful mission, pouncing on its competition to manufacture a lead as great as 31-7. Missouri State stared down the red ring of death but didn’t disconnect its controller. The Bears’ instead fought to the finish but failed to recover a late onside kick, watching a successful inaugural season conclude in heartbreaking fashion.\n\nArkansas State relied on the arm of veteran quarterback Jaylen Raynor, whose passing attributes looked maxed out at 99 overall for much of Thursday night. The junior finished 17-of-31 with 288 yards, delivering three touchdowns to three different targets. On the Red Wolves’ opening series, he delivered a strike to a 7-yard touchdown Jaylen Bonelli. He continued his rampage with a 71-yard sideline deep shot to sixth-year senior receiver Corey Rucker — a longtime Arkansas State standout playing his final collegiate game. Then to manufacture a 24-7 halftime lead, the quarterback played pitch and catch with Chauncy Cobb, who caught a 4-yard touchdown set up by one of Raynor’s several successful deep balls.\n\nRucker, who exceeded 100 yards in Arkansas State’s 2024 bowl victory, concluded his college career on a spectacular note. He posted 166 yards and a touchdown on six catches, exceeding 160 for the fifth time in Red Wolves colors. Rucker already held designation as the program’s career leader in receiving yards, but on his lone touchdown, he moved into sole possession of first place on Arkansas State’s all-time receiving touchdowns list, breaking a tie with Omar Bayless.\n\nMissouri State’s seventh-year quarterback Jacob Clark also saw a noble sendoff despite a losing effort, firing for 349 yards and four touchdowns against the Sun Belt opponent. However, the quarterback — who had been sacked more than any other QB in the FBS this year — was upended in the backfield all game long by an Arkansas State defense which generated nine sacks. Missouri State’s offensive line looked like it accidentally set the difficulty to Heisman mode, as Arkansas State defensive linemen Ethan Hassler, Demarcus Hendricks, and Cody Silger all frequented the hit stick to register multiple sacks in a pure domination.\n\nWith that immense pressure, Missouri State’s offense severely lagged, punting on seven of its first eight possessions. Because its lone touchdown over that 8-drive span was a 39-yard completion to Dash Luke, the Bears never snapped the ball inside the Arkansas State 35-yard line until roughly one minute remained in the third quarter. With Luke thriving in the second half behind a 7-reception, 169-yard, 2-touchdown performance, Missouri State’s offense surged late, but the Bears were in too deep of a hole with too time to fully climb out.\n\nMissouri State (7-6, 5-3 CUSA) still finished its first FBS season above .500 — a remarkable accomplishment for the program. Now that the Bears checked off their first box of playing in a bowl game, in 2026 they’ll look to move one step further by managing a bowl victory. Leading the charge will be SMU offensive coordinator Casey Woods, who is slated to accept the Missouri State head coaching position later in the week, as the team transitions to year two.\n\nArkansas State (7-6, 5-3 Sun Belt) wins its second-straight bowl game under head coach Butch Jones. The Red Wolves never won a single bowl until 2012, but now six bowl trophies will reside in their facilities when they return to Jonesboro. With the win, Arkansas State clinched back-to-back winning campaigns for the first time since its fruitful 2011-19 stretch, concluding the 2025 season with a new achievement in the inaugural Xbox Bowl.",

    "fullText": "A little over 24 hours before Texas A&M (11-1, 7-1 SEC) hosts Miami (10-2) in the first round of the College Football Playoff, the Aggie media team, which released a tease of the uniform Texas A&M will wear, maroon jerseys, while an updated video on Thursday night provided a glimpse at the full uniform, which will rival Miami's regular white road look.\n\nAccording to the video, Texas A&M will enter Kyle Field on Saturday wearing maroon helmets, maroon jerseys, and white pants, which is the standard home look. The only exception was the blackout look against Mississippi State earlier this season, which resulted in a 31-9 win over the Bulldogs.\n\nHowever, the Aggies tricked all of us earlier this week after hinting at a potential blackout, which would have been a first for an early 11:00 a.m. kickoff. Still, whatever the Aggies wear isn't going to magically help this team get past the Hurricanes, who will field one of the best defenses in the country, and one of the more electrifying playmakers in freshman wide receiver Malachi Toney.\n\nHead coach Mike Elko is hoping that playing at home three weeks after losing to Texas on the road to end the regular season is the recipe for success, paired with a solid week of practice. The news is that star running back Le'Veon Moss, who has missed the last six games due to an ankle injury, is \"questionable\" to play on Saturday. At the same time, senior linebacker Scooby Williams and safety Bryce Anderson are \"probable\" with 75% chance to take the field.\n\nEither way, Texas A&M's best path to facing Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl is for starting quarterback Marcel Reed to play at an elite level, both in the pocket and with his legs, against a Miami defensive line led by Rueben Bain, who is looking to ruin the Aggies' offensive game plan.\n\nEvery era has led to this. #GigEm | #BTHOmiami pic.twitter.com/3zcz2bRZwp\n\n— Texas A&M Football (@AggieFootball) December 18, 2025\n\nTexas A&M will host Miami on Saturday at 11:00 a.m. with coverage on ABC and ESPN.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M will wear maroon/maroon/white vs. Miami in the CFP",

    "fullText": "The Texas City disaster was an industrial accident that occurred on April 16, 1947, in the port of Texas City, Texas, United States, located in Galveston Bay. It was the deadliest industrial accident in U.S. history and one of history's largest non-nuclear explosions.\n\nThe explosion was triggered by a mid-morning fire on board the French-registered vessel SS Grandcamp (docked at port), which detonated her cargo of about 2,300 tons (about 2,100 metric tons) of ammonium nitrate.[1] This started a chain reaction of fires and explosions aboard other ships and in nearby oil-storage facilities, ultimately killing at least 581 people, including all but one member of Texas City's volunteer fire department.[2]: 100\n\nThe disaster drew the first class action lawsuit against the United States government, on behalf of 8,485 plaintiffs, under the 1946 Federal Tort Claims Act.\n\nThe Port of Texas City is located in a protected harbor inland from Galveston, with relatively straight access to the Gulf of Mexico.[2]: 6  The port expanded greatly during World War II, as many wartime chemical and oil plants were located in or near the city. In 1946, some 4,000 ships loaded or unloaded cargo in the port.[2]: 9  The growth of the town caused a housing shortage, and housing for Black and Hispanic residents was located close to the port.[2]: 10  The nearest neighborhood was only .5 miles (0.80 km) away from the site of the explosion.[2]: 11  Within 1 mile (1.6 km) there were six major chemical or oil companies, nine piers, eleven warehouses, a grain elevator, and many homes.[2]: 12\n\nWhile oil and chemicals had been the major export, the port also began shipping ammonium nitrate in 1945.[2]: 15  The ammonium nitrate, needed either as fertilizer or an explosive, was manufactured in Nebraska and Iowa and shipped to Texas City by rail before being loaded onto ships.[3] The dedicated Texas City Terminal Railway provided final mile service directly to the port.[2]: 11  Export of ammonium nitrate increased significantly in the postwar years as ammunition manufacturing was converted into fertilizer manufacturing, to be sent for export to rebuild war-torn Europe.[2]: 20\n\nSS Grandcamp was a recently re-activated 437-foot-long (133 m) Liberty ship. Originally named SS Benjamin R. Curtis in Los Angeles in 1942, the ship served in the Pacific theater and was mothballed in Philadelphia after the war.[4] In a Cold War gesture, the ship was assigned by the U.S. to the French Line to assist in the rebuilding of France, along with other efforts in Europe. Accordingly, she was captained by a French crew led by Captain Charles de Guillebon. Along with the ammonium nitrate—a very common cargo on the high seas—she was carrying small-arms ammunition, machinery, and bales of sisal twine on the deck.[2]: 19  Her engine was undergoing repairs while docked and thus the ship was inoperable.[2]: 32\n\nAnother ship in the harbor, SS High Flyer, was docked about 600 feet (200 m) away from Grandcamp. The ammonium nitrate aboard the two ships, and fertilizer in an adjacent warehouse, were intended for export to farmers in Europe. Grandcamp had arrived from Houston, where the port authority did not permit the loading of ammonium nitrate.\n\nGrandcamp had a mixed cargo, containing chiefly ammonium nitrate, but also twine, peanuts, tobacco, some small arms ammunition, engineering equipment, and cotton.[2]: 1  The ammonium nitrate was manufactured in a patented process, mixed with clay, petrolatum, rosin and paraffin wax to avoid moisture caking. It was packaged in 100 pounds (45 kg) paper sacks.[2]: 20  Longshoremen reported the bags were warm to the touch before loading.\n\nHigh Flyer held an additional 961 short tons (872 t) of ammonium nitrate[1] and 1,800 short tons (1,600 metric tons) of sulfur.[citation needed]\n\nGrandcamp arrived in port on April 11, 1947, and began loading 2,500 short tons (2,300 t) of fertilizer on April 14, which were to be sent to France.[2]: 19  The storage deck of Grandcamp was divided into five storage holds, with a fuel oil bunker located between Hold 3 and Hold 4. The fertilizer was to be added to Hold 2 and Hold 4. The loading continued until interrupted by rain on the evening of the 15th. Loading was set to continue on the morning of the 16th, with the last 600 short tons (540 t) set to be loaded into the partially full Hold 4.[2]: 19, 35\n\nOn Wednesday, April 16, 1947, around 8 a.m., smoke was spotted in the cargo hold of Grandcamp while it was still moored. Longshoremen used a gallon jug of water and two fire extinguishers, but they had no effect and the cargo hold filled with smoke. The longshoremen were then ordered to leave the hold. At this point, the captain of Grandcamp ordered that no water be used, lest the cargo be ruined. Instead, he ordered all hatches sealed and the hold to be filled with steam in an attempt to smother the fire.[2]: 2  This was unlikely to be effective, as ammonium nitrate is an oxidizer, thus neutralizing the extinguishing properties of steam. The steam may have contributed to the fire by converting the ammonium nitrate to nitrous oxide, while augmenting the already intense heat in the ship's hold.[5] Around 8:30 a.m. the stevedores who were fighting the fire were ordered off the ship, likely because the heat had become too intense and there were concerns that the small arms ammunition could cook off.[2]: 31\n\nWhile the port had fire hydrants, it lacked its own fire engines. A call for outside help was sent at 8:37.[2]: 31  Responding fire departments included the Texas City volunteer fire department and the Republic Oil Refining Company firefighting team.[2]: 2  As crews fought the fire, the hatch on Hold 4 blew off from the pressure of the steam. A column of yellow-orange smoke billowed out, the typical color for nitrogen dioxide fumes.[1] The fire and its unusual-looking smoke attracted a crowd of about 500 spectators (including many children) along the shoreline, who believed they were at a safe distance.[6] Around 9:00, the fire abated slightly, but the steam suppression system was still actively heating Hold 4. Most of the crew had disembarked the ship, and Captain Guillebon was taking a headcount on the pier.[2]: 34\n\nAt 9:12 a.m., the ammonium nitrate reached an explosive threshold and the Grandcamp detonated. The exact cause is unknown, but the likeliest explanation is that the heat of the fire caused the fuel oil bunker adjacent to Hold 4 to split, pouring fuel onto the hot, decomposing fertilizer, creating an impromptu ANFO mixture that was susceptible to detonation.[2]: 35  The Grandcamp was entirely obliterated. The resulting explosion caused utter destruction within 2,000 feet (610 m) and extreme damage throughout the port. The tremendous blast produced a 15 ft (4.6 m) tsunami and a shockwave, levelling nearly 1,000 buildings on land.[2]: 3  The tsunami was responsible for a significant portion of onlooker deaths.[2]: 37\n\nFlying shrapnel resulted in ignition of refineries and chemical tanks along the waterfront. Falling bales of burning twine from Grandcamp's cargo added to the damage, and her anchor was hurled across the city. Two sightseeing airplanes flying nearby were blown out of the sky,[7] while 8 miles (13 km) away, half of the windows in Galveston were shattered.[8] The explosion blew almost 6,350 short tons (5,760 t) of the ship's steel into the air, some at supersonic speed.\n\nThe Monsanto Chemical Company plant adjacent to the slip where Grandcamp was docked suffered the brunt of the first explosion. Of its 574 employees and contractors, 234 were killed, and 200 more were injured. Every man of the Monsanto fire fighting team, which were laying hose reels opposite the Grandcamp, was killed.[2]: 37–38\n\nThe exact damage caused by the first explosion is not fully ascertainable, as the second explosion wreaked further havoc and came before a survey of the damage could be done.[2]: 38\n\nSeven ruptured oil tanks at the Republic Refinery began to burn, letting off thick clouds of black smoke.[2]: 39  Burning sulfur in a dockside warehouse created acrid fumes.[2]: 40\n\nOfficial casualty estimates came to a total of 567, including all the crewmen who remained aboard Grandcamp. All but one member of the 28-man Texas City volunteer fire department were killed in the initial explosion on the docks while fighting the shipboard fire. With fires raging throughout Texas City, first responders from other areas were initially unable to reach the site of the disaster.\n\nStill, 112 people within 500 ft (150 m) of the Grandcamp survived, including many witnesses who would allow for later reconstruction of the events.[2]: 37–38\n\nThe first explosion had set Highflyer free from its moorings, and it had drifted across the harbor, coming to rest against SS Wilson B. Keene. Her crew stayed aboard for an hour before the smoke of the burning oil and sulfur forced them to leave. In the afternoon, two men boarded Highflyer searching for injured crewmembers. They noted that her cargo was ablaze and reported it to someone on the harborfront. This message seems to have gone unheeded for several hours until it was realized that this indicated a serious problem. Only around 11 p.m. did tugboats attempt to pull Highflyer away from the docks. Despite having cut her anchor, they were unable to move her. They fled the area around 1 a.m. the next day (April 17). Ten minutes later, at 1:10 a.m., Highflyer exploded, killing two more people. According to witnesses, the explosion was more powerful than that of Grandcamp. Casualties were light since the docks had already been evacuated, but the second explosion exacerbated the damage to nearby ships and buildings. The blast destroyed the nearby Wilson B. Keene. The steel frame of Highflyer had been heated until glowing, and these chunks rained down upon Texas City setting mass fires.[2]: 4–5, 40–41  One of the propellers was blown off and subsequently found nearly a mile inland. It is now in a memorial park near the anchor of Grandcamp.\n\nThe Texas City disaster is generally considered the worst industrial accident in U.S. history. Witnesses compared the scene to the fairly recent images of the 1943 air raid on Bari and the much larger devastation after an atomic bomb was dropped at Nagasaki.\n\nOf the dead, 405 were identified and 63 have never been identified. The latter remains were placed in a memorial cemetery in the north part of Texas City near Moses Lake. An additional 113 people were classified as missing, for no identifiable parts were ever found. This figure includes firefighters who were aboard Grandcamp when she exploded. There is some speculation that there were hundreds more killed but uncounted, including visiting seamen, undocumented laborers and their families, and an untold number of travelers. More than 800 people were left orphaned or widowed.[2]: 6  However, there were also some survivors among people as close as 70 feet (21 m) from the dock. The victims' bodies quickly filled the local morgue. Several bodies were laid out in the local high school's gymnasium for identification by family or friends.\n\nMore than 5,000 people were injured, with 1,784 admitted to 21 area hospitals. More than 500 homes were destroyed and hundreds damaged, leaving 2,000 homeless. The seaport was destroyed, and many businesses were flattened or burned. Over 1,100 vehicles were damaged and 362 freight cars were obliterated; the property damage was estimated at $100 million[3] (equivalent to $1,100,000,000 in 2024). This number may not encompass the full scope of damage: a further $500 million of oil products burned (equivalent to $5,499,000,000 in 2024).\n\nA 2-short-ton (1.8-metric-ton) anchor of Grandcamp was hurled 1.62 miles (2.61 km) and found in a 10-foot (3 m) crater. It was installed at a memorial park. The other main 5-short-ton (4.5-metric-ton) anchor was hurled 1⁄2 mile (800 m) to the entrance of the Texas City Dike. It rests on a \"Texas-shaped\" memorial at the entrance. Burning wreckage ignited everything within miles, including dozens of oil and chemical tanks. The nearby city of Galveston was covered with an oily fog that left deposits over every exposed outdoor surface.\n\nSome of the deaths and damage in Texas City were due to the destruction and subsequent burning of several chemical plants (including Monsanto and Union Carbide), oil storage, and other facilities near the explosions. Twenty-seven of the twenty-eight members of Texas City's volunteer fire department and three of four members of the Texas City Heights Volunteer Fire Department who were on the docks near the burning ship were killed. One firefighter, Fred Dowdy, who had not responded to the initial call, coordinated other firefighters arriving from communities up to 60 miles (100 km) away. Alvin Fussell, sole survivor of the Heights Volunteer firefighters, was driving to work in Alvin when he heard of the fire on the radio. Eventually 200 firefighters arrived from as far away as Los Angeles. Fires resulting from the cataclysmic events were still burning a week after the disaster, and the process of body recovery took nearly a month. All four fire engines of Texas City were twisted and burned husks.\n\nThe cause of the initial fire on board Grandcamp was never determined. It may have been started by a cigarette discarded the previous day, meaning the ship's cargo had been smoldering throughout the night when the fire was discovered on the morning of the explosion.[1] Historian Hugh Stephens later identified human error as the cause, and cites numerous reasons as to why a minor fire became such a severe incident.[2]: 6\n\nStephens identifies as root causes the expansion of the port, the proximity of dangerous port operations to the rest of Texas City, a lack of community awareness of the danger posed by chemical hazards, and a lack of safety preparation.\n\nSmoking was commonplace at the time. While officially prohibited at the port, such prohibitions were not enforced and smoking was widespread.[2]: 28–29\n\nStephens notes that in interviews and written accounts, few residents of Texas City seemed to understand the danger of the port, as exemplified by the large crowd that assembled to watch the Grandcamp burn. Stephens suggests that in an era before disasters like Bhopal (1984), or Superfund legislation (1986), the sense of danger from chemicals was amorphous. \"Before the accident, Texas City's citizens felt secure because such a disaster had never happened and they could therefore assume it never would.\"[2]: 13  Stephens also points out that Texas City was a boomtown in a time when the rest of the country was still recovering from the Great Depression, in which most of the city owed its prosperity to the oil and chemical industry, which may have further led to lax attitudes.[2]: 14\n\nThe danger of ammonium nitrate may not have been well known at the time. While Army manuals classified it as a high explosive, general belief (and even guidance from the Department of Agriculture) held that fertilizer was not dangerous under typical conditions.[2]: 21–22  However, the danger was not unknown. The Port of Houston had forbidden the loading of fertilizer in 1946.[2]: 24\n\nIn the months before the disaster, local Catholic priest William F. Roach remarked on the concerning industrial conditions by stating \"I feel like I’m sitting on a keg of dynamite.\"[9]\n\nNeither the Port of Texas City, the Texas City Terminal Railway, the City itself, nor any of the oil refineries, had a disaster preparedness plan—which even at the time was regarded as inadequate.[2]: 13–14  The Port itself had no Port authority that could regulate both land and sea operations. Thus, safety was fragmented between companies and between land and sea. The end of military supervision at the end of the war also played a role. Safety authority should have transferred from the military back to the United States Coast Guard, but the Coast Guard failed to take preventative actions and safety instead returned to the hands of private parties.[2]: 16–17  Texas City also failed to police or regulate the dock; such matters were left to security hired by the Terminal Railway.[2]: 27\n\nThe disaster received national media attention, with offers of assistance coming from around the country. Several funds were established to handle donations, particularly the Texas City Relief Fund, created by the city's mayor Curtis Trahan.[2]: 104–105  One of the largest fundraising efforts for the city and the victims of the disaster was organized by Sam Maceo, one of the two brothers who ran organized crime in Galveston at the time. Maceo organized a large-scale benefit on the island, featuring entertainers including Phil Harris, Frank Sinatra, and Ann Sheridan.[2]: 104–105 [10] In the end, the Texas City Relief Fund raised more than $1 million ($15 million in today's terms). Payouts for fire insurance claims reached nearly $4 million ($55.7 million in today's terms).[2]: 104–105\n\nWithin days of the disaster, major companies that had lost facilities in the explosions announced plans to rebuild in Texas City and in some cases to expand their operations. Some companies implemented policies of retaining all of the hourly workers who had previously worked at destroyed facilities with plans to use them in the rebuilding. Cost estimates of the industrial reconstruction were estimated at approximately $100 million ($1.41 billion adjusted for inflation).[2]: 104–105\n\n\"Commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the explosion [...], just as the Phoenix bird symbolizes resurrection from the ashes of despair, the 'Phoenix Fountain' epitomizes courage and the triumph of the human spirit. [...] Chewelah, Washington Artist David Govedare was commissioned by Mayor Charles T. Doyle [...] [to] produce this twelve foot sculpture from half inch cor-ten steel. Architect Joseph Allen Hoover and City Engineer James McWhorter designed the fountain built by Texas City's Public Works Department.\"[11]\n\nMany of the legal cases seeking compensation were combined into Elizabeth Dalehite, et al. v. United States, under the recently enacted Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). On April 13, 1950, the district court found the United States government responsible for a litany of negligent acts of omission and commission by 168 named agencies and their representatives, in the manufacture, packaging, and labeling of ammonium nitrate. This was further compounded by errors in transport, storage, loading, fire prevention, and fire suppression, all of which led to the explosions and the subsequent carnage.\n\nOn June 10, 1952, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned this decision, finding that the United States maintained the right to exercise its own \"discretion\" in vital national matters. The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed that decision (346 U.S. 15, June 8, 1953), in a 4-to-3 opinion, noting that the district court had no jurisdiction under the federal statute to find the government liable for \"negligent planning decisions\" which were properly delegated to various departments and agencies. In short, the FTCA clearly exempts \"failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty\", and the court found that all of the alleged acts in this case were discretionary in nature.[12]\n\nIn its dissent, the three justices argued that, under the FTCA, \"Congress has defined the tort liability of the government as analogous to that of a private person\", i.e., when carrying out duties unrelated to governing. In this case, \"a policy adopted in the exercise of an immune discretion was carried out carelessly by those in charge of detail\", and that a private person would certainly be held liable for such acts. A private person is held to a higher standard of care when carrying out \"inherently dangerous\" acts such as transportation and storage of explosives.\n\nAccording to Melvin Belli in his book Ready for the Plaintiff! (1965), Congress acted to provide some compensation after the courts refused to do so.[13] The Dalehite decision was eventually \"appealed\" to Congress, where relief was granted by means of legislation (Public Law 378, 69 Stat. 707 (1955)).[14] When the last claim had been processed in 1957, 1,394 awards totaling nearly $17 million had been made.",
