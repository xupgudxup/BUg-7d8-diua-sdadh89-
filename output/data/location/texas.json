    "fullText": "Thanks to recent football and men’s basketball matchups which all resulted in losses, BYU fans have learned to really loathe Texas Tech.\n\nThus, Cougar Nation should be mighty proud of what its women’s basketball squad accomplished Wednesday night.\n\nBYU scored a 73-61 upset victory over the No. 19-ranked Lady Raiders at the Marriott Center, toppling the Big 12’s top team for Lee Cummard’s first ranked win at the helm of the Cougars’ program.\n\n“I’m just really proud of the group and glad to see their hard work paying off and be rewarded for how close of a group it is, and how hard they work and prepare for these games,” Cummard told reporters after the win. “(We) had a great couple days of practice, great shoot around this morning. I just want (the players) to know that, you know, they’re a really good team and they’re rewarded for that tonight.”\n\nBYU trailed for less than a minute to open the night before quickly pulling ahead and never looking back, leading by as many as 17 points against a Texas Tech team that had yet to lose on the road and was 19-1 prior to arriving in Provo.\n\n“I felt like at least tonight, regardless of who they have, our five were more connected and tighter as a group, and we were the better five on the court,” Cummard said.\n\nThe Cougars shot a collective 47.3% from the field and 44.4% from 3-point range — a far cry from their previous season average of 29.7% — while feasting down low for 36 paint points.\n\nshots are fallin' ☔️\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/HaKZkEFic9\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\nBest exemplifying BYU’s fight was center Lara Rohkohl, who finished with 15 points, eight rebounds and a game-high plus/minus of +15, refusing to let the ultra-physical Lady Raiders push her around in the post.\n\n“They were a little aggressive down there, but you know, we stood against it and we did a good job down there,” Rohkohl said. “The guards were giving me perfect passes into my hands, and I just had to go up and finish it.”\n\nFeeding Rohkohl often was star sophomore point guard Delaney Gibb, who fought through double teams for 18 points, five rebounds and six assists while swiping four steals on the defensive end of the floor.\n\nAutomatic🔥\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/E5ruG3c7mP\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\n“I know that if I’m getting hounded and double-teamed, I can kick to shooters and pass to Lara and they’re gonna make plays out of it,” Gibb said. “And so I think we played super connected tonight and just moved the ball really well, which opened up great looks for us.”\n\nSome of that ball movement came from Rohkohl, who cashed in two assists by kicking outside to Gibb for a pair of 3-pointers.\n\nBullseye Delaney🎯\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/Dn4lsb6UJ6\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\n“Being in the paint and kicking out to a 3, in my opinion, is the best shot that there is,” Gibb said. “It’s really easy to make, all your momentum is going to the hoop. (Rohkohl) was fighting hard in the paint, and so for her to unselfishly spray out to shooters on the outside is never going to go unnoticed.”\n\nBYU’s leading scorer was freshman guard Olivia Hamlin, who put up the best performance of her young career — especially considering the competition — by posting 20 points of 9 of 15 shooting with four rebounds and two steals.\n\nEleven of Hamlin’s 20 points came in the first quarter to set the tone for the remainder of the contest, and she ended the night with six fourth quarter points to help bury Texas Tech for good.\n\n🤯🤯🤯\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/XSatpyvczA\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\n“She was on it from the jump,” Cummard said of Hamlin. “... Tonight it was hard to keep her off the court. She was hugely impactful on the defensive end with those steals early, but even late, just with constant pressure.\n\n“People have a really hard time going around her, and people have a really hard time keeping her in front. (She is a) huge, huge asset to the group every game, but tonight she just brought it, you know, played with force and made plays for the group.”\n\nDefensively, BYU was outstanding, holding the Lady Raiders to 33.3% shooting and scoring 24 points off of 21 forced turnovers. The Cougars clamped down hardest in the fourth quarter, allowing just three makes on 16 field goal attempts.\n\nROBBED 'EM🤯\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/Jl3Aw4Ioyr\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\n“It was the most connected we’ve been all year defensively,” Cummard said. “We’ve been a pretty good defensive team, you know, visually, but also metrically speaking.\n\n“... I just thought that we minimized some of the lapses that we’ve had in some of our losses. ... It shows growth in what we’re doing, but just overall, the connectivity on that (defensive) end was really, really good as a group.”\n\nWith the win, BYU is now 15-4 on the campaign and has already matched last year’s mark of four victories in Big 12 play — a number Cummard’s Cougars will certainly increase given their 11 remaining conference contests, along with the newfound confidence from toppling a team such as Texas Tech.\n\n“I feel like we’ve had a pretty tough schedule thus far, and so it’s kind of like a breath of air (to win),” Gibb said. “I feel like this game is going to bring so much confidence to our team. We have a ton of young players, some of which this is their first year of college basketball, and so I think this kind of just reminds us that we can compete at the highest level. I think going into our next conference games, we’re going to be hungry to do the same thing every single night.”\n\nWIN CAM👐 pic.twitter.com/0H7qG1QNUo\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026",

The storm arriving late this week and into the weekend is shaping up to be a “widespread potentially catastrophic event from Texas to the Carolinas,” said Ryan Maue, a former chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

    "fullText": "ATLANTA (AP) — With many Americans still recovering from multiple blasts of snow and unrelenting freezing temperatures in the nation’s northern tier, a new storm is set to emerge this weekend that could coat roads, trees and power lines with devastating ice across a wide expanse of the South.\n\nThe storm arriving late this week and into the weekend is shaping up to be a “widespread potentially catastrophic event from Texas to the Carolinas,” said Ryan Maue, a former chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\n“I don’t know how people are going to deal with it,” he said.\n\nForecasters on Tuesday warned that the ice could weigh down trees and power lines, triggering widespread outages.\n\n“If you get a half of an inch of ice — or heaven forbid an inch of ice — that could be catastrophic,” said Keith Avery, CEO of the Newberry Electric Cooperative in South Carolina.\n\n‘Great swaths’ of heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain expected\n\nThe National Weather Service warned of \"great swaths of heavy snow, sleet, and treacherous freezing rain” starting Friday in much of the nation’s midsection and then shifting toward the East Coast through Sunday.\n\nTemperatures will be slow to warm in many areas, meaning ice that forms on roads and sidewalks might stick around, forecasters say.\n\nThe exact timing of the approaching storm — and where it is headed — remained uncertain on Tuesday. Forecasters say it can be challenging to predict precisely which areas could see rain and which ones could be punished with ice.\n\nCold air clashing with rain to fuel a 'major winter storm’\n\nAn extremely cold arctic air mass is set to dive south from Canada, setting up a clash with the cold temperatures and rain that will be streaming eastward across the southern U.S.\n\n“This is extreme, even for this being the peak of winter,” National Weather Service meteorologist Bryan Jackson said of the cold temperatures.\n\nWhen the cold air meets the rain, the likely result will be “a major winter storm with very impactful weather, with all the moisture coming up from the Gulf and encountering all this particularly cold air that’s spilling in,” Jackson said.\n\nAn atmospheric river could set up across the southern U.S.\n\nAn atmospheric river of moisture could be in place by the weekend, pulling precipitation across Texas and other states along the Gulf Coast and continuing across Georgia and the Carolinas, forecasters said.\n\n“Global models are painting a concerning picture of what this weekend could look like, with an increasingly strong signal for ice storm potential across North Georgia and portions of central Georgia,” according to the National Weather Service's Atlanta office.\n\nIf significant accumulations of ice strike metro Atlanta, it could be a problem through the weekend since low temperatures early Monday are expected to be around 22 degrees (minus 5.6 Celsius) in Atlanta. The city's high temperature on Monday is forecast to be around 35 degrees (1.7 Celsius).\n\nHighway and air travel could be tangled by the storm\n\nTravel is a major concern, as southern states have less equipment to remove snow and ice from roads, and extremely cold temperatures expected after the storm could prevent ice from melting for several days. In Michigan, more than 100 vehicles crashed into each other or slid off an interstate southwest of Grand Rapids on Monday.\n\nThe storm is also expected to impact many of the nation’s major hub airports, including those in Dallas; Atlanta; Memphis, Tennessee; and Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nPolar air from Canada to keep northern states in a deep freeze\n\nUnusually cold temperatures are already in place across much of the northern tier of the U.S., but the blast of arctic air expected later this week “will be the coldest yet,” Jackson said.\n\n“There’s a large sprawling vortex of low pressure centered over Hudson Bay,” Jackson said of the sea in northern Canada that’s connected to the Arctic Ocean. “And this is dominating the weather over all of North America.”\n\nTexas could be a harbinger for other parts of the South\n\nSome of the storm’s earliest impacts could be in Texas on Friday, as the arctic air mass slides south through much of the state, National Weather Service forecaster Sam Shamburger said in a briefing on the storm.\n\n“At the same time, we’re expecting rain to move into much of the state,” Shamburger said.\n\nLow temperatures could fall into the 20s or even the teens in parts of Texas by Saturday, with the potential for a wintery mix of weather in the northern part of the state.\n\nForecasters cautioned that significant uncertainty remains, particularly over how much ice or snow could fall across north and central Texas.\n\n“It’s going to be a very difficult forecast,” Shamburger said.\n\nAt an Arkansas hardware store, customers gear up for storm\n\nIn Little Rock, Arkansas, a steady stream of customers on Tuesday were stocking up on supplies at Fuller and Son Hardware.\n\n“Right now parents of young children are getting sleds,” said James Carter, the company’s director of operations.\n\nPeople were also getting shovels, ice-melting products and covers for outside faucets to keep them from freezing, since low temperatures in the Little Rock area are forecast to fall into the teens, he said.\n\nPanjwani reported from Washington.

    "description": "When will Jayden Quaintance return?",
    "fullText": "The Kentucky Wildcats have won three straight games in SEC play and are now 3-2 in league play. Last week, they earned hard-fought road wins at LSU and Tennessee. Kentucky is now 29th in the AP Poll, having received the fourth-most votes of teams just outside the Top 25.\n\nUnfortunately, the Wildcats will have to continue winning without big man Jayden Quaintance. Head coach Mark Pope announced on Tuesday that Quaintance will miss Wednesday’s matchup with the Texas Longhorns.\n\n“He will not play tomorrow night, but he’s making progress,” Pope said at his Tuesday press conference. “We’re super optimistic (about Quaintance playing again this season), and he’s kind of going through the process, and hopefully he’ll be back soon. I know that’s not very descriptive, but I’m trying to be protective of him also.”\n\nIt’s great that there is optimism that Quaintance can return this season. He does add something to this team, and that can matter in February and March.\n\nQuaintance is a really good rebounder and shot blocker. His presence makes Kentucky’s defense better. However, he’s not much of an offensive threat just yet. He can become one, and his defensive prowess is really intriguing.\n\nKentucky put up a valiant effort against Tennessee on the board Saturday with Quaintance out. That shows this team can win even as Quaintance deals with swelling in his knee, which has kept him out since the Missouri game.\n\nThe Wildcats host Texas on Wednesday, a team that averages over 86 points per game. Kentucky weathered the storm without Quaintance on Saturday against a big Tennessee team. They’ll have to do so again on Wednesday against the Longhorns, and likely Saturday as well when they host Ole Miss.",

    "fullText": "Records are meant to be broken, and the Texas A&M Aggies wasted no time proving it at the Corky Classic in Lubbock. Several members of the Aggie Track & Field program made history over the weekend, setting the tone for what could be a special indoor campaign.\n\nTexas A&M opened the season with force, stacking up 39 top‑ten finishes, 19 medalists, and multiple athletes climbing the program’s all‑time performer lists.\n\nThe first breakthrough came from senior thrower Henry Zimmerman, who delivered a school‑record performance in the weight throw. His final attempt—21.88m (71‑9.5)—secured second overall and made him the top collegiate finisher in the field.\n\nFreshman pole vaulter Lily Carlson followed with a statement of her own. Competing in just her second collegiate meet, Carlson cleared 4.41m (14‑5.5) to break the Texas A&M indoor record previously held by All‑American Heather Abadie. She claimed gold with a dominant seven‑inch margin over the next closest competitor.\n\nThe record‑setting weekend wrapped on the final day when freshman distance runner Peter Narumbe delivered one of the fastest 1,000m races in NCAA history. His time of 2:19.88 not only broke Luca Santorum’s school record—it also stands as the 17th‑fastest 1,000m ever recorded at the collegiate level. His gold‑medal finish ranks him third all‑time among NCAA freshmen.\n\nWhile Texas A&M is traditionally known for its outdoor prowess, this year’s squad has the depth and talent to be a real factor indoors and in the SEC race. The Aggies return to action on January 25, hosting the Ted Nelson Invitational at the Fasken Indoor Track & Field facility.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes, and opinions.

    "fullText": "SAN ANGELO, Texas (Concho Valley Homepage) — The Rams and Rambelles stay home for a midweek matchup versus Texas A&M-Kingsville.\n\nThe Angelo State Rams and Rambelles are set to host Lone Star Conference rival Texas A&M-Kingsville in back-to-back games. Before the matchups tip off on Wednesday night, both teams have lots to build on following last week’s performances.\n\nHead coach Alesha Ellis and the Rambelles split their home series last week, losing to UT Permian Basin and defeating UT Dallas. The biggest difference in the second game revolves around ball distribution. Four different Rambelles reached double figures in the same game, led by Taylor Grona and Majik Esquivel with 16 and 14 points, respectively. The key going forward is continued ball distribution along with primary leadership, especially among the two young athletes.\n\n“[Grona and Esquivel] are some of the best competitors that I’ve ever coached,” Ellis said. “Taylor has done such a great job and so has Majik. They’re only sophomores this year, so they’re pretty young. They come to practice every day willing to get better, and they’re the ones asking how to get better.”\n\nOn the Rams’ side, the injury bug continues. Limited player availability is a disadvantage anytime, but the Rams refuse to go down without a fight. Angelo State comes off a win over UT Permian Basin and loss to UT Dallas. The biggest difference in those games was UT Dallas’ zone defense displayed in the second half, something head coach Vinay Patel’s squad wasn’t previously accustomed to.\n\n“We just have not seen a ton of zone this year, [so it was] probably smart on [UT Dallas’] part to zone us,” Patel said. “Some of our top three-point shooters have been out with injury, but it’s the first time that we’ve seen a predominant zone for an entire half. I thought it became contagious when we started missing shots. We spent the weekend working on our zone attack, making sure we’re ready if we see it again and try to figure some different things out.”",

    "fullText": "EL PASO, Texas (AP) — An immigrant from Nicaragua was found dead at a Texas immigration detention facility last week, federal officials said.\n\nVictor Manuel Diaz appears to have killed himself Wednesday at the sprawling tent complex at the U.S. Army's Fort Bill base in El Paso, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement. The federal investigation into his death continues.\n\nIt's the same facility where ICE said another detainee died earlier this month as staff members tried to keep him from killing himself. But a fellow detainee said at least five officers were restraining the handcuffed inmate and at least one had an arm around his neck.\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE — This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988.\n\nDiaz was swept up on Jan. 6 in the federal crackdown on immigration in Minnesota and sent to Texas, ICE said.\n\nDiaz entered the United States in March 2024 and Border Patrol officers took him into custody, He was released on parole pending a court date and a judge ordered him to leave the U.S. in an August hearing that Diaz did not attend, ICE said.\n\nDiaz was given a final order for removal on Jan. 12, two days before he was found unconscious in his room, authorities said.\n\nICE did not release any other details on Diaz's death. The agency notifies Congress and releases a statement on its website of all in-custody deaths.\n\nDiaz, 36, was being held at Camp Montana East where ICE said another detainee, Geraldo Lunas Campos, died as staff members tried to prevent him from killing himself.\n\nBut a preliminary investigation by the El Paso County Medical Examiner’s Office found Lunas Campos, 55, died from asphyxia from chest and neck compression and said the death would likely be classified a homicide.\n\nA fellow detainee told the AP that Lunas Campos was handcuffed and refused to go back into his cell when at least five guards pinned him to the floor. The detainee said at least one of the guards squeezed an arm around Lunas Campos' neck.\n\nICE said it is still investigating that death.",

    "title": "Led by Texas, New Hampshire, states race to prove can –\"Bitcoin on bal sheet\"",
    "description": "Many U.S. states are planning bitcoin strategic reserves, and other forms of crypto financing, showing budgets are buying into the digital assets trend.",
    "fullText": "Led by Texas and New Hampshire, U.S. states across the national map, both red and blue in political stripes, are developing bitcoin strategic reserves and bringing cryptocurrencies onto their books through additional state finance and budgeting measures.\n\nTexas recently became the first state to purchase bitcoin after a legislative effort that began in 2024, but numerous states have joined the \"Reserve Race\" to pass legislation that will allow them to ultimately buy cryptocurrencies.\n\nNew Hampshire passed its crypto strategic reserve law last May, even before Texas, giving the state treasurer the authority to invest up to 5% of the state funds in crypto ETFs, though precious metals such as gold are also authorized for purchase. Arizona passed similar legislation, while Massachusetts, Ohio, and South Dakota have legislation at various stages of committee review.\n\nDespite much of the legislation being largely sponsored or co-sponsored by Republicans, the adoption of crypto at the state level is not expected to strictly fall along party lines. The 2024 election cycle was the first time that the cryptocurrency industry played a major role in lobbying in both state and national elections. In fact, it was the largest corporate donor in an election cycle, with support given to candidates on both sides. It is already amassing a war chest for the 2026 midterms.\n\nCongress is currently debating a crypto market structure bill, and state-level politicians are as much out to prove that they, and their states, won't be left out of the digital assets boom. Justin Marlowe, a public policy professor at the University of Chicago, sees the state-level trend as largely one of signaling at present. \"If you're a governor and you want to broadcast that you are amenable to innovative business development in the digital economy, these are relatively low-cost, low-risk ways to send that signal. That's why we've seen leaders across the ideological spectrum and all over the country take tangible steps in this direction,\" he said.\n\nWhere the state-level crypto efforts can be described as \"bigger steps\" — Marlowe cited Texas, Arizona, and Florida, as examples — he said it has helped to acknowledge the growing political power of crypto advocates in these states.\n\nSimilarities in the actions taken across states to date include include authorizing the state treasurer or other investment official to allow the investment of a limited amount of public funds in crypto and building out the governance structure needed to invest in crypto. This often will involve more frequent reporting requirements and stronger custodial agreements compared to traditional asset classes. The seeding of the reserve can take the form of utilizing cash or government-seized crypto, as in the recent case of the federal government. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a strategic bitcoin reserve last March, but limited the authorization to seized crypto in an effort to show taxpayers would bear no financial burden.\n\nIt is no surprise that Texas was the first state to fund a crypto reserve. Texas has been a crypto hub for years through its role in bitcoin mining. The state's affordable and flexible power, as well as a political environment that has largely been pro-crypto, led Texas in recent years to a sizable position in not just the national, but global bitcoin hashing market.\n\n\"Texas has spent the last few years becoming one of the key centers of bitcoin activity, especially on the mining side,\" said Christian Catalini, founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab, seeing this move as one that early branded the state as \"open for business\" when it comes to digital assets.\n\n\"Once you've made that bet on infrastructure and industry, adding some Bitcoin exposure at the treasury level is a natural next step,\" Catalini said. Such a move essentially makes the state's balance sheet one that is explicitly aligned with the ecosystem it aims to attract.\n\nTexas also has a long history with bitcoin's traditional market competitor: gold.\n\n\"Texas has proven to be a bedrock of government adoption of bitcoin, starting with laws that allow for legal custody arrangements akin to gold storage laws that are well established there,\" said Nik Bhatia, founder of The Bitcoin Layer.\n\nWhen it comes to storing physical gold, Texas has clear rules on storage and ownership, and even the language invoked – vaults, custodians – helps grease the wheels for crypto assets at the state level. The Texas Bullion Depository of 2015, which allowed for state-level depository of bullion and precious metals, was specifically adapted to apply to digital assets like bitcoin. The Texas Bullion Depositary was the first state-administered precious metals depository in the nation.\n\nTexas has not purchased any on-chain bitcoin. After passing the legislation to create a strategic bitcoin reserve that gave authorization to the state comptroller to hold the cryptocurrency, Texas purchased a stake in a bitcoin ETF — roughly $5 million in the largest bitcoin ETF, the BlackRock iShares' Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which since its launch in January 2024 has grown to over $72 billion in assets under management.\n\nThe Comptroller's office made its purchase on the morning of November 20, 2025, when the price of a single bitcoin was $91,336. As of Saturday morning, bitcoin was trading at a little over $95,000.\n\nBhatia said the approval of bitcoin ETFs by the SEC was crucial to the state plans to be comfortable with the holdings under current U.S. securities law. \"Using ETFs is a very clean and safe way to invest in bitcoin, minimizing storage logistical risk and opting for security law protection,\" Bhatia said.\n\nTexas state officials have described this purchase — which deployed only half of the $10 million set aside by the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve — as a \"placeholder\" while security and storage for raw bitcoin can be put into place.\n\nIn addition to the concept of reserve funds, states are bringing crypto into core finance functions, with an approach that balances the inherent trepidation of venturing into new terrain with a desire to be a part of the fast-moving crypto realm.\n\nNew Hampshire, for example, became the first state to approve the issuance of a bitcoin-backed municipal bond last November, a $100 million issuance that would mark the first time cryptocurrency is used as collateral in the U.S. municipal bond market. The deal has not taken place yet, though plans are for the issuance to occur this year. \"The idea is they'll use bitcoin to back a municipal bond issue, the proceeds of which will then be divvied up into loans to smaller governments for economic development projects across the state,\" Marlowe said. Repayment of these loans will recapitalize the fund.\n\nIt is a creative evolution in state finances, but like many of the mechanisms for crypto development at the state level, it utilizes existing financial structures and state goals, according to Marlowe, with similar public bonds in prior decades used for projects like clean water, school upgrades, and other infrastructure. \"What's different here is it's bitcoin rather than taxpayer dollars as the collateral,\" he said.\n\nIn numerous states, including, Colorada, Utah, and Louisiana, crypto is now accepted as payment for taxes and other state business. As more state public finance crypto efforts develop, the shift represents a change in a core philosophy of safety and liquidity that has dominated the investing of state and local funds for centuries.\n\nIn recent decades, assets including real estate and private equity expanded the investment approach of public funds, but crypto represents not only the most recent addition, but the most volatile.\n\n\"For many in the state/local investing industry, crypto-backed assets are still far too speculative and volatile for public money,\" Marlowe said. \"But others, and I think there's a sort of generational shift in the works, see it as a reasonable store of value that is actually stronger on many other public sector values like transparency and asset integrity,\" he added.",

The rapper has posted her hilarious, expletive-filled celebrations to Diggs' touchdowns on social media amidst the news that the pair welcomed their first child together in November.\n\nAnd now, Cardi B has gone through yet another rite of passage for sports fans celebrating their team's big win: dunking on analysts that predicted incorrectly.\n\nOn Sunday, the Patriots bested the Houston Texans 28-16 in a game that was basically over at the half thanks to C.J. Stroud's four interceptions. The loss was quite a stunning one for Texans supporters and especially for analysts that predicted Houston to come out on top. ESPN's NFL Live crew, for example, all picked the Texans in an incredibly amusing segment on the show this week.\n\nAs expected, the picks backfired tremendously and the Patriots cruised to the AFC Championship. However for the final blow, right after the clock hit zero, Cardi B swooped in to dunk on the NFL Live crew's disastrously incorrect predictions for Sunday's game with a short — but sweet — video response.\n\nTHEY DIDN’T BELIEVE IN US !!!

He later signed a two-year deal with the Broncos in 2023 and then resigned in 2025. Stidham has spent much of his career as a dependable backup, occasionally stepping in when needed but never fully seizing a starting role.

    "description": "We moved from Texas to Denver and downsized our home, gaining more time together, walkability, community, and freedom for our kids.",
    "fullText": "In July 2025, my husband, Zach, and I moved our family of four from the suburbs of Ft Worth, Texas, to Denver.\n\nAfter nearly 10 years of marriage, two kids, and three work-related moves, it was finally time to settle in a place of our choosing. This time, we didn't just want a change of scenery; we wanted a change of lifestyle.\n\nBut finding a house in the bustling city neighborhood of our dreams within our budget meant downsizing — drastically.\n\nMoving from our 3,300-square-foot home to a 2,300-square-foot bungalow with 1,200 square feet of actual living space (the rest being unfinished basement) wasn't easy. It meant swapping our large kitchen island for a small dining table. It meant no more master bath soaking tub, my refuge from life's stresses on more occasions than I could count. And it meant my kids giving up their separate rooms to share one.\n\nBut what we've gained in the quality and quantity of time spent together is worth every bit of lost square footage.\n\nOur bigger house in Texas required more upkeep, and we were more than happy to give that up for extra free time on the weekends. Now, we spend our time visiting attractions such as the Denver Zoo and the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. We're fostering our kids' curiosity, exploring new places together. Our everyday life feels more special and meaningful because these shared experiences amplify our family connection.\n\nWe're also getting out in nature more. Aside from weekend hiking and skiing adventures, our days revolve around outdoor living. We walk everywhere we can, including restaurants, parks, and even Trader Joe's, which is beneficial because driving to Trader Joe's means parking at Trader Joe's, and nobody enjoys that. Our moods are lighter, and our stresses are reduced.\n\nThe first time we walked to a restaurant instead of driving, it felt like we were on vacation. Our lives had always been car-dependent, but that's no longer the case. The kids laughed and raced each other down the sidewalk. We marvelled at the mature trees and brightly colored flowers lining 7th Avenue Parkway. There was no timeline or rushing, just the joy of being present. When we made our way home after an alfresco dinner at Postino, I asked my son if he liked walking to dinner. He asked simply, \"Can we do this every day?\"\n\nZach and I frequently sit on our front porch while our boys play with neighborhood kids, a first for us. Having houses so close together makes it easier to meet people and form real connections. We know almost every household on our block, and we regularly visit with our closest neighbors. We even enjoyed our first block party in August, which fell on my eldest's birthday, and according to him, it was his \"Best birthday ever!\"\n\nOur boys run between yards while we chat with new friends. They are experiencing a childhood closer to the one we grew up with. They're building confidence and finding their place, and that's translating to more smiles and fewer tantrums. Zach and I are finding our village, and parenthood feels less solitary.\n\nOn a recent trip back to Texas for Thanksgiving, I texted our next-door neighbor to let her know we'd be out of town. Without even asking, she offered to take in our mail. It may be a small gesture, but that sense of community is priceless to us.\n\nDownsizing has also allowed our kids to play more independently in an outdoor space that feels safe and protected. We have an unobstructed line of sight to the backyard, and no matter where my husband and I are in the house, we can hear them if they need us. The result has been hours of creative play, building campsites and outdoor kitchens, playing soccer and baseball, and having water balloon fights or Nerf battles.\n\nMost evenings, my kids are in the backyard playing games and getting dirty. When the weather is nice, they run around with their friends down the street. I would never have felt comfortable not knowing every move my kids were making before, but here, where everyone is watching out, and I can wave at my kids down the block to signal when it's time to come home, less space means more freedom.\n\nOur downsized life isn't always perfect. Despite all our decluttering efforts, we're still left with more stuff than we can accommodate. We also struggle with the lack of privacy, and at times, our smaller shared space feels more claustrophobic than cozy. However, downsizing for an urban lifestyle has given us the opportunity to live beyond our four walls, and that's worth more than any amount of space could ever be.",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M's 2026 quarterback room will be a talking point heading into the early parts of the offseason, as head coach Mike Elko and new QB coach Joey Lynch have yet to land a veteran signal caller from the transfer portal after incoming redshirt junior QB Marcel Reed announced his return for the 2026 campaign, while 2025 backup Miles O'Neill transferred to North Carolina earlier this year.\n\nOn paper, Marcel Reed's backup will likely be incoming sophomore Brady Hart, who served as the No. 3 option last season and is well respected by the coaching staff, which has praised his maturity and accuracy despite being the youngest player on the roster. A former Michigan commit, Hart possesses enough arm talent and now a year of experience to be trusted in the No. 2 role.\n\nStill, it's highly unlikely Elko adds another veteran arm, and with 2025 four-star signee Helaman Casuga, Brady Hart will immediately compete with the freshman phenom, who has continued to show off his impressive accuracy and touch during Friday's Polynesian Bowl, as the Utah high school standout found 2027 five-star Ohio State commit for one of the better throws you'll see all weekend.\n\nCasuga is a much more fluid athlete than Brady Hart and fits the mold of what Elko and new offensive coordinator Holmon Wiggins are looking for in making plays out of the pocket. However, his lack of experience at the college level will hinder his ability to secure the backup job, but anything is possible.\n\nCasuga finished his career at Corner Canyon HS with 11,516 yards, 113 touchdowns, and 32 interceptions, combined with 1,083 rushing yards and 18 touchdowns.\n\nNice throw from Texas A&M QB signee @HelamanCasuga. https://t.co/erKpgmde5v\n\n— Carter Karels (@CarterKarels) January 17, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Watch QB Helaman Casuga's impressive throw during Polynesian Bowl",

    "fullText": "The Texas A&M basketball team enters rivalry weekend looking to reset after a grueling double‑overtime loss to Tennessee. It was a tough shooting night across the board, and the Aggies will aim to get back on track Saturday when they travel to Austin to face the Texas Longhorns.\n\nFor head coach Bucky McMillan, it marks his first experience in the Lone Star Showdown — and an opportunity to do something no A&M coach has accomplished since 2001: win in Austin. He understands exactly what this rivalry means to Aggies everywhere, but he’s also pushing his team to stay grounded and avoid getting swept up in the noise.\n\n\" ...our players got to block out all the noise and just know that our success going to in this game is going to be on their ability to focus on the things that equate to winning basketball\"\n\nIt’s not about minimizing the rivalry, McMillan emphasized, but recognizing the bigger picture. The SEC grind is long, and every conference game carries weight. That perspective has been reinforced by A&M’s 3–1 start in league play — a stretch that has boosted the team’s confidence despite the close calls.\n\n\"it's been great and that's why I say we can get caught up like a game slips away here or there where you're right there to win it. But there's also a lot of games on the flipside of that that we executed and won,\"\n\nA win on Saturday would move the Aggies to 4–1 in SEC play, a meaningful early‑season marker that could pay dividends later in the year. For McMillan, the message remains simple: play their style, trust their habits, and let the chips fall where they may.\n\nBelow, you can watch the full press conference with Coach Bucky.\n\nTexas A&M will face the Texas Longhorns in Austin at the Moody Center on Saturday, January 17, at 5 p.m. CT.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A Cuban immigrant died in a Texas immigration detention facility earlier this month during an altercation with guards, and the local medical examiner has indicated that his death will likely be classified as a homicide.\n\nThe federal government has provided a differing account surrounding the Jan. 3 death of Geraldo Lunas Campos, saying the detainee was attempting suicide and staff tried to save him.\n\nA witness told The Associated Press that Lunas Campos died after he was handcuffed, tackled by guards and placed in a chokehold until he lost consciousness. The immigrant’s family was told by the El Paso County Medical Examiner’s Office on Wednesday that a preliminary autopsy report said the death was a homicide resulting from asphyxia from chest and neck compression, according to a recording of the call reviewed by the AP.\n\nThe death and conflicting accounts have intensified scrutiny into the conditions of immigration jails at a time when the government has been rounding up immigrants in large numbers around the country and detaining them at facilities like the one in El Paso where Lunas Campos died.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is legally required to issue public notification of detainee deaths. Last week, it said Lunas Campos, a 55-year-old father of four and registered sex offender, had died at Camp East Montana, but made no mention of him being involved in an altercation with staff immediately before his death.\n\nIn response to questions from the AP, the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, on Thursday amended its account of Lunas Campos’ death, saying he tried to kill himself.\n\n“Campos violently resisted the security staff and continued to attempt to take his life,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said. “During the ensuing struggle, Campos stopped breathing and lost consciousness.”\n\nIn an interview before DHS updated its account, detainee Santos Jesús Flores, 47, from El Salvador, said he witnessed the incident through the window of his cell in the special housing unit, where detainees are held in isolation for disciplinary infractions.\n\n“He didn’t want to enter the cell where they were going to put him,” Flores told the AP on Thursday, speaking in Spanish from a phone in the facility. “The last thing he said was that he couldn’t breathe.”\n\nAmong the first sent to Camp Montana East\n\nCamp Montana East is a sprawling tent facility hastily constructed in the desert on the grounds of Fort Bliss, an Army base. The AP reported in August that the $1.2 billion facility, expected to become the largest detention facility in the United States, was being built and operated by a private contractor headquartered in a single-family home in Richmond, Virginia. The company, Acquisition Logistics LLC, had no prior experience running a corrections facility.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the guards present when Lunas Campos died were government employees or those of the private contractor. Emails seeking comment on Thursday from Acquisition Logistics executives received no response.\n\nLunas Campos was among the first detainees sent to Camp Montana East, arriving in September after ICE arrested him in Rochester, New York, where he lived for more than two decades. He was legally admitted to the U.S. in 1996, part of a wave of Cuban immigrants seeking to reach Florida by boat.\n\nICE said he was picked up in July as part of a planned immigration enforcement operation due to criminal convictions that made him eligible for removal.\n\nNew York court records show Lunas Campos was convicted in 2003 of sexual contact with an individual under 11, a felony for which he was sentenced to one year in jail and placed on the state’s sex offender registry.\n\nLunas Campos was also sentenced to five years in prison and three years of supervision in 2009 after being convicted of attempting to sell a controlled substance, according to the New York corrections records. He completed the sentence in January 2017.\n\nLunas Campos’ adult daughter said the child sexual abuse accusation was false, made as part of a contentious custody battle.\n\n“My father was not a child molester,” said Kary Lunas, 25. “He was a good dad. He was a human being.”\n\nOn the day he died, according to ICE, Lunas Campos became disruptive while in line for medication and refused to return to his assigned dorm. He was then taken to the segregation block.\n\n“While in segregation, staff observed him in distress and contacted on-site medical personnel for assistance,” the agency said in its Jan. 9 release. “Medical staff responded, initiated lifesaving measures, and requested emergency medical services.”\n\nLunas Campos was pronounced dead after paramedics arrived.\n\nFlores said that account omitted key details — Lunas Campos was already handcuffed when at least five guards pinned him to the floor, and at least one squeezed his arm around the detainee's neck.\n\nWithin about five minutes, Flores said, Lunas Campos was no longer moving.\n\n“After he stopped breathing, they removed the handcuffs,” Flores said.\n\nFlores is not represented by a lawyer and said he has already consented to deportation to his home country. Though he acknowledged he was taking a risk by speaking to the AP, Flores said he wanted to highlight that “in this place, guards abuse people a lot.”\n\nHe said multiple detainees in the unit witnessed the altercation, and security cameras there should have captured the events. Flores also said investigators had not interviewed him.\n\nDHS did not respond to questions about whether Lunas Campos was handcuffed when they say he attempted suicide, or exactly how he had tried to kill himself.\n\n“ICE takes seriously the health and safety of all those detained in our custody,” McLaughlin said. “This is still an active investigation, and more details are forthcoming.”\n\nDHS wouldn’t say whether other agencies were investigating. The El Paso medical examiner’s office confirmed Thursday that it conducted an autopsy, but declined further comment.\n\nA final determination of homicide by the medical examiner would typically be critical in determining whether any guards are held criminally or civilly liable. When such deaths are ruled accidental or something other than homicide, they are less likely to trigger criminal investigations, while civil wrongful death lawsuits become harder to prove.\n\nThe fact that Lunas Campos died on an Army base could also limit state and local officials’ legal jurisdiction to investigate. An El Paso County District Attorney’s Office spokesperson declined to comment Thursday on whether it was involved in an investigation.\n\nThe deaths of inmates and other detainees after officers hold them face down and put pressure on their backs and necks to restrain them have been a problem in law enforcement for decades. A 2024 AP investigation documented hundreds of deaths during police encounters in which people were restrained in a prone position. Many uttered “I can’t breathe” before suffocating, according to scores of body camera and bystander videos. Authorities often attempt to shift the blame for such deaths to preexisting medical conditions or drug use.\n\nDr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist who has studied prone restraint deaths, said the preliminary autopsy ruling of homicide indicates guards' actions caused Lunas Campos’ death, but does not mean they intended to kill. He said the medical examiner’s office could come under pressure to stop short of calling it a homicide, but will probably “stick to its guns.”\n\n“This probably passes the ‘but for’ test. ‘But for’ the actions of the officers, he would not have died. For us, that’s generally a homicide,” he said.\n\n‘I just want justice, and his body here’\n\nJeanette Pagan-Lopez, the mother of Lunas Campos’ two youngest children, said the day after he died the medical examiner’s office called to inform her that his body was at the county morgue. She immediately called ICE to find out what happened.\n\nPagan-Lopez, who lives in Rochester, said the assistant director of the El Paso ICE field office eventually called her back. She said the official told her the cause of death was still pending and that they were awaiting toxicology report results. He also told her the only way Lunas Campos’ body could be returned to Rochester free of charge was if she consented to his being cremated, she said.\n\nPagan-Lopez declined and is now seeking help from family and friends to raise the money needed to ship his body home and pay for a funeral.\n\nAfter failing to get details about the circumstances surrounding his death from ICE, Pagan-Lopez said she got a call from a detainee at Camp Montana East who then put her in touch with Flores, who first told her about the altercation with guards.\n\nSince then, she said she has repeatedly called ICE, but is no longer getting a response. Pagan-Lopez, who is a U.S. citizen, said she also twice called the FBI, where an agent took her information and then hung up.\n\nPagan-Lopez said she and Lunas Campos were together about 15 years before breaking up eight years ago. She described him as an attentive father who, until his detention, had worked in a minimum-wage job at a furniture store, the only employment she said he could find due to his criminal record.\n\nShe said that in the family's last phone call the week after Christmas, Lunas Campos talked to his kids about his expected deportation back to Cuba. He said he wanted them to visit the island, so that he could stay in their lives.\n\n“He wasn’t a bad guy,” Pagan-Lopez said. “I just want justice, and his body here. That’s all I want.”\n\nAttanasio reported from Seattle, and Foley from Iowa City.\n\nContact the AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org or https://www.ap.org/tips/.",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M's transfer portal haul now includes 18 commits, led by Alabama transfer wide receiver Isaiah Horton. After missing out on Auburn transfer wideout Cam Coleman, who committed to Texas, the Aggies possess one of the most complete wide receiver rotations in the country. While starting quarterback Marcel Reed is well-equipped next season, any success will start in the trenches.\n\nWith the NFL Draft declaration deadline up, five 2025 offensive linemen are off to the next level, including junior left guard Chase Bisontis, who would have likely returned if it weren't for his first or second round draft grade. Needing at least four replacements, head coach Mike Elko and O-line coach Adam Cushing immediately went to work, adding LSU tackle Tyree Adams and LSU guard Coen Echols, who was once an A&M commit.\n\nFurther shoring up the depth chart, Alabama guard/tackle Wilkin Formby, along with veteran South Carolina guard Trovon Baugh, committed to the Aggies, as all four players will compete for starting spots heading into the spring practice period.\n\nTexas A&M's defensive line rotation was also thin entering the new year, but the new additions of Northwestern edge Anto Saka, San Diego State edge Ryan Henderson, and defensive linemen CJ Mims (North Carolina), Angelo McCullom (Illinois), and Colorado transfer Brandon Davis-Swain make this group look formidable on paper at the very least.\n\nHowever, Texas A&M's 2026 secondary has a chance to be one of the top cornerback/safety rotations in the SEC, as senior corners Dezz Ricks and Julio Humphrey will return, and combined with transfer corner Rickey Gibson, this group is primed to be in lockdown mode on nearly every passing play. At safety, Colorado transfer Tawfiq Byard is extremely versatile and one of the top coverage safeties, having not allowed a passing touchdown in over 500 coverage snaps.\n\nWhile the Aggies could still add a running back, many, including myself, believe this group is all but complete, and, according to On3's transfer portal rankings, is the fourth-ranked transfer cycle, and No. 1 among SEC programs, positioned below Virginia Tech (3), Texas Tech (2), and Indiana (1).\n\nIn today's college football landscape, \"adapt or die\" is the prevailing mentality: either sink or stay above water. If adding double-digit transfers isn't the first priority at the end of every season, relying on younger players usually results in an average-to-below-average season.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M's 2026 transfer portal class ranked Top 5 nationally",

    "description": "One sheriff who leads an anti-smuggling task force says the software helps “develop leads to eventually obtain probable cause.” Civil liberties experts say its use violates constitutional rights.",
    "fullText": "Editor’s Note: This story is the third installment in a series produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center’s AI Accountability Network.\n\nGoliad County police kicked off one human smuggling investigation not with a suspect’s name, but with a discarded receipt and cell phone surveillance software. In June 2021, Chief Deputy Tim Futch chased a speeding F-150 headed toward Houston on U.S. Highway 59; he believed the vehicle was carrying undocumented immigrants, concealed in the truck bed beneath plywood, according to a police report. Trying to evade the cops, the driver pulled into a ditch, and around 10 people bailed out and took off sprinting.\n\nIn the aftermath, Roy Boyd, the sheriff in this county of 7,000 situated halfway between Laredo and Houston, surveyed the scene. The driver proved hard to identify via the pickup’s plate. But, on the ground, he spotted a fresh receipt from a liquor store in Pasadena, a Houston suburb, he recalled in a June 2024 interview with the Texas Observer.\n\nThe stub of paper was enough, Boyd said, to justify deploying an expensive—and controversial—artificial intelligence-powered surveillance tool called Tangles. A specially-trained analyst used the receipt, Boyd said, to conduct warrantless surveillance on the suspected driver—and on other smart phone users—by utilizing a Tangles add-on feature called Webloc, which tracks mobile devices’ movements in a client-selected virtual area through a capability called “geofencing.”\n\nAfter the bailout incident, Boyd acquired a license for the tool with about $300,000 in state border security grants—though the sheriff admits that he’s not a tech guy: In 2024, he still used a hand-me-down iPhone 10, which hit the market in 2017.\n\nA tall, slim, seventh-generation Texan, Boyd fits the archetype of a small-town Southern sheriff with his firm handshake and light drawl. He usually wears his sand-colored cowboy hat, leather belt, and a matching holster manufactured by prisoners in a neighboring county. The latter encases a silver Colt pistol engraved with “Remember Goliad,” referencing the Mexican army’s massacre of Anglo combatants who lost a battle in which Boyd says his ancestors died.\n\nBoyd worked as a career cop in the neighboring South Texas city of Victoria before being elected sheriff of Goliad County in 2020. He’s since hobnobbed with President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago and met repeatedly with border czar Tom Homan, and he leads a multijurisdictional task force named after Operation Lone Star, Governor Greg Abbott’s multi-billion dollar border militarization mission. The task force pools deputies and resources from nearly 60 Texas agencies mainly for anti-smuggling operations. It began with mostly rural departments, but it expanded to include more populous counties, the Texas National Guard, the U.S. Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the Coast Guard. Task force members have spent at least $300,000 on Tangles, and according to emails obtained from Goliad County, many have been granted access to the software, which can track mobile device movements via third-party commercial data.\n\nTangles scrapes information from the open, deep, and dark webs and is the premier product of Cobwebs Technologies, a cybersecurity company founded in 2014 by three former members of special units in the Israeli military. In 2023, the Nebraska-based tech firm PenLink Ltd acquired the company.\n\nThe software has been met with criticism from civil liberties advocates, especially given that its WebLoc add-on enables warrantless device tracking. Normally, when U.S. police officers seek cell phone records or location data, they must obtain a warrant by presenting probable cause of a crime to a judge. In 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Carpenter v. United States that warrants are required for obtaining location data from cell phone providers. But the rise of the multi-billion dollar data broker industry has created a free-for-all that enables police and others to purchase massive amounts of cell phone location data without judicial review.\n\nNathan Wessler, an ACLU attorney who argued the Carpenter case, said data broker-built services like Tangles pose the same privacy issues as those decided in the Supreme Court case and that law enforcement’s ability to buy location data constitutes an erosion of constitutionally protected rights. “Police are doing an end run around this well-articulated system of judicial oversight by just paying money instead of going to a judge,” he said. “There’s just no checks of police abuse against that.”\n\nIn the Goliad County case, a police analyst drew a virtual fence to examine an area that spanned about 300 miles between the Pasadena liquor store and the U.S.-Mexico border based on the day and time stamped on the receipt. He discovered that six phones used within a mile of the store had been tracked again later at a Texas immigration checkpoint, Boyd said. He didn’t specify which checkpoint; the U.S. Border Patrol has over a dozen of them in Texas, some permanent and some temporary.\n\nBoyd rattles off statistics about the success of his task force in tracking gangs, but he provided only the one example involving Tangles and never said whether the information they obtained by geofencing helped lead to any arrest. In response to records requests, the department said it had no reports that mentioned Tangles, despite the fact that Goliad has had the software for more than three years. The corresponding incident report for the case Boyd cited doesn’t mention Tangles, though he said an analyst used the software. It does state that the department collaborated with a Homeland Security Investigations analyst.\n\nGenerally, Boyd said his office uses the software to find “avenues for obtaining probable cause” or “to verify reasonable suspicion that you already have”—not as a basis by itself to make arrests.\n\nBeyond Goliad, Tangles has more powerful, deep-pocketed users. The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), for example, has invested heavily in the software. DPS spent nearly $200,000 on Tangles in 2021 as an emergency purchase related to Operation Lone Star, and the agency has repeatedly expanded its contract. In 2024, DPS inked a 5-year, $5.3-million contract for 230 named users. ICE’s Office of Intelligence signed a contract worth around $2 million to use the software in 2025, and the DEA in that same timeframe committed more than $10 million.\n\nBoyd and Caleb Breshears, a Goliad County deputy and the task force commander, argued in interviews that Tangles presents no privacy concerns since its location tracking software doesn’t reveal names, only device identification numbers in the online advertising ecosystem. Tangles users cannot search by name or by phone number; its location data is sourced from applications in which consumers consented to sharing their whereabouts, Breshears said.\n\nNor does Tangles reveal what vehicle is associated with a device, but combined with Texas’ broader arsenal of surveillance tools, which includes a fleet of drones and a network of automated license plate readers, “Those are things that we might be able to piece together,” Boyd said.\n\nPenLink Ltd, Tangles’ present owner, touts its worldwide successes in combating human trafficking, drug smuggling, and money laundering, but the company declined to provide specific examples to the Observer of how the platform has assisted in U.S. cases. “Penlink is proud to provide law enforcement with solutions that keep communities safe, protect people, rescue victims and solve crimes,” company spokesperson Kristine German said in a written statement. “Our technology enables law enforcement to spot threats faster and use evidence more efficiently to advance criminal investigations. The solutions we provide to the government exclusively use commercially available data. We follow industry best practices and comply with all relevant privacy laws, platform policies, and ethical standards.”\n\nIn El Salvador, where authoritarian president Nayib Bukele has suspended civil liberties, the national police force purchased Tangles in 2020, according to the investigative outlet El Faro. Just 13 months later, the state’s Bukele-controlled legislative assembly approved criminal code reforms that allowed the judicial use of information obtained via warrantless surveillance by tools like Tangles, clearing the way for the dictator’s state police to legally spy on citizens, El Faro reported. When asked about a repressive regime using its products, PenLink said the company does “not discuss specific customers or contracts.”\n\nPenLink pitches Tangles as an “open source intelligence” software that compiles publicly available information. Yet even Meta, the social media giant that owns Facebook and Instagram and has been denounced for stockpiling too much of its own users data, has accused Cobwebs Technologies, the company that invented Tangles, of operating as a “surveillance-for-hire” outfit; Meta banned Cobwebs Technologies from its platforms in 2021.\n\nIn a separate emailed statement, PenLink distanced itself from the Meta ban: “Penlink acquired Cobwebs in 2023, after those issues had been addressed and we are not aware of any issues since.”\n\nBut critics find U.S. law enforcement’s growing domestic use of an array of surveillance tools presents major risks to civil liberties by enabling police to build a robust profile of almost anyone’s life and movements without a warrant or probable cause. They find phone-tracking tools like Tangles to be particularly troubling.\n\n“There’s this veneer of respect for privacy that is painted over all of this data aggregation and consolidation,” said Beryl Lipton, a researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a California-based nonprofit focused on digital privacy-related civil liberties. Watchdog organizations like the EFF and ACLU have been forced to go to court to discover more information about its use: Last January, PenLink sued a California sheriff’s office in an attempt to prevent the department from releasing public records to EFF that contained details about the company’s products and prices, arguing they were “trade secret-protected information.” EFF intervened in the case and ultimately prevailed. The sheriff’s office handed over the records.\n\nSo far, federal and Texas agencies combined have committed to spending at least $8 million dollars specifically for Tangles, according to a year-long Observer investigation. Yet, agencies refuse to say how Tangles has benefitted Texas criminal or immigration probes. Boyd said he couldn’t think of a time that phone-tracking data has been directly linked to any arrest or prosecution in Goliad County, despite his agency’s task force role. “Most of that is probably going to be on the federal side and not so much on the state side,” Boyd said. “I can’t think of any time when [Tangles] has been used for the prosecution of somebody. … It has not been a key component in our cases.”\n\nDPS declined comment on its use of the costly technology. In response to a records request, the agency told the Observer it has no incident reports and only seven confidential internal investigative reports from 2023 and 2024 that mention “Cobwebs” (a shorthand sometimes used to refer to the the software named after the company that created it) or “Tangles,” but it withheld them claiming that releasing the documents could “provide wrong-doers, drug traffickers, terrorists, and other criminals with information concerning how Department operations are planned, implemented and staffed.”\n\nIn the last three years, many DPS investigators, police departments including those of major cities such as Dallas and Houston, and nearly 20 Texas sheriff’s offices have obtained a Tangles log-in. The larger agencies have been evasive about how and when they use the tool, declining to provide examples to the Observer.\n\nNo agencies contacted for this story provided examples of Tangles’ use in any specific criminal cases. Dallas Police Department spokesperson Corbin Rubinson said only that “Tangles has been in use by the Department for several years and is used consistently in criminal investigations. The WebLoc add-on is used less frequently and produces fewer investigative leads.” A Houston police spokesman said Tangles is used for “crime analysis, for supporting criminal Investigations, and for supporting situational awareness/threat assessments” and that the department does not use the WebLoc add-on that enables warrantless device tracking. Other agencies that purchased it, including the Killeen Police Department and the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office, did not respond.\n\nTexas agencies’ failure to produce reports on arrests or other results linked to the controversial technology has two possible interpretations, experts say. “Either this is just a massive waste of taxpayer money, right? They’re spending all this money on the tool that they’re not actually using,” said Wessler, the ACLU attorney, “or they’re using it and hiding it from judges, criminal defense attorneys, criminal defendants and the press, which is a big story in itself.”\n\nIn April, state Senator Sarah Eckhardt, an Austin Democrat, raised questions during a border security committee hearing about DPS’ investment of $20 million in multi-year contracts for various AI-powered social media monitoring tools like Tangles, following an earlier Observer report on the state police agency’s spending on surveillance tech.\n\nIn response, DPS Director Freeman Martin told Eckhardt and other committee members that such software has been critical in preventing mass shootings and said DPS had identified a potential school shooter using the technology.\n\nBut when the Observer approached Martin a few days later at a border sheriffs’ conference, he added only a few general observations, saying that the software has helped police save lives and make arrests.\n\n“If I talk about technology now, and we’re asking for funding, some people like it, some people hate it,” he said, clarifying that Tangles in particular was controversial after the Observer asked about the software. “We don’t want to lose those tools,” he said. “We want all the tools. When somebody’s threatening to shoot up the school, we got to find them. We can’t wait till school starts.”\n\nMartin initially promised to speak more about the agency’s successes with Tangles after the legislative session, which ended in June. But he never responded to requests for a follow-up interview made through his secretary and the agency’s communications office, nor did he answer a list of questions sent by the Observer.\n\nWessler, the ACLU attorney, is skeptical that Tangles has been used to prevent mass casualty events. He said in emergencies police can obtain warrants and send rapid requests to cell phone service providers, who generally can supply more up-to-date and accurate location data than third-party tools. “The claim that this has helped prevent mass shootings is really interesting, and sounds pretty far-fetched to me.”\n\nBreshears, the Goliad County task force leader, explained that the software’s underlying location data are typically days old. That means it does not allow for real-time tracking and is only useful when multiple factors align. “When you say ‘track’, technically it’s correct, but … I’m not tracking you live. I can only see where you have been,” Breshears said. “It’s all historical information.”\n\nTexas law does not explicitly require police to document use of AI-powered surveillance tech, so police reports may not be a reliable indicator of whether Tangles has been used even in investigations that led to arrests. In the 2025 legislative session, Southlake Republican Giovanni Capriglione introduced a bill that would have mandated government agencies using AI to disclose use of these systems to “consumers.” It is unclear how that might have applied to police reports, which under the public information act already can be heavily redacted under certain circumstances, especially if an investigation is ongoing. Legislators ultimately passed an overhauled version of the bill that does not explicitly require police to document or disclose use of AI.\n\nUnder due process rules and Texas’ Michael Morton Act, prosecutors must share relevant investigative reports, videos, and other related information to anyone charged with a crime. But the Observer reached out to all 80 federal public defender offices, emailed Texas defense attorneys and Dallas’ district attorney, and interviewed a longtime Houston public defender and a former Goliad-area prosecutor, yet no one provided information about Tangles being mentioned in records disclosed to them while representing a client or charging a defendant in criminal court.\n\nAmrutha Jindal, executive director of Lone Star Defenders, which provides public defenders for migrants prosecuted under Operation Lone Star, said she had never come across any evidence the software had been used in any of the nonprofit’s cases. “Alarms are ringing in my head,” Jindal said in a phone interview. “There’s also a question of—are we even being told?”\n\nThe Observer found many examples in police records of how Texas state troopers have surveilled the homes of immigrants or made pre-textual traffic stops to help ICE target and detain people who were not charged with a crime. However, it is unclear whether state police used Tangles or other surveillance tools. The Observer reached out to a network of more than 60 immigration attorneys in Texas and beyond, and none offered examples of how this software may have been used against their clients.\n\nIn Washington D.C., the district’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency (HSEMA) has purchased Tangles for several years, though it has not said how it deploys the tool; in August, the ACLU of DC filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking records.\n\nOne of the executives at PenLink, the parent company that sells Tangles, is Derek Maltz, a former DEA agent who participated in Border 911, a political nonprofit, with others who are now homeland security leaders in the Trump administration. He served as PenLink’s executive director of government relations from 2014 to 2025. Throughout that time, the DEA doled out more than $100 million in contracts with PenLink for its various products, according to public federal spending data. Maltz left the company to serve as the DEA’s acting director for five months after Trump’s second inauguration. Last summer, Maltz pivoted back to PenLink, where he became senior vice president of global business growth and strategy. Since Maltz re-joined PenLink last July, the company has garnered about $3.4 million \n\nIn a written statement, a PenLink spokesperson said: “Derek Maltz is a veteran national security and law enforcement leader who brings 28 years of federal law enforcement experience to his role at Penlink. His appointment as Acting Administrator speaks to his expertise in this field, and we are pleased to welcome him back to Penlink. We are compliant with Federal Post-Employment Restrictions.” Maltz did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nParomita Shah, an attorney and co-founder of Just Futures Law, a legal advocacy group focused on the intersection of immigration and surveillance issues, said Maltz’s case illustrates a well-established revolving door between tech companies and the federal government. “As much as these guys complain about the swamp, they certainly benefit from it,” Shah said.\n\nLocal agencies from New York to California have also bought Tangles. In Arizona, the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office—a populous county about halfway between Phoenix and Tucson—paid more than $90,000 in 2022 and 2023 to use the platform. In an email, Pinal County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Sam Salzwedel noted that deputies have deployed Tangles for a “variety of investigations, large and small,” but declined to share any success stories, citing law enforcement sensitivity. Salzwedel said that WebLoc, the warrantless phone tracking feature, appeared to be used sparingly.\n\n“I have not surveyed our handful of users, but one of our analysts just told me he has only used it a few times,” Salzwedel wrote in an email. “No warrant was obtained.”\n\nA reimbursement request released by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the privacy-focused nonprofit, and first reported by the Arizona Mirror, offers a few anecdotes about how Tucson police have used Tangles: To surveil protesters during one of former Vice President Kamala Harris’s visits to the state and to track and identify a suspect accused in a string of Circle K cigarette robberies. Tucson police also apparently used Tangles in an attempt to find the culprit behind an attempted abduction of a young woman, but without success.\n\nEven police who possess Tangles, like Boyd, warn of its potential for abuse. He says his department seldom deploys it for fear of violating constitutional privacy rights—and that despite leading a police task force, the sheriff is skeptical of cops collecting too much sensitive information.\n\n“Do you really want all your stuff in a database where any law enforcement official can go in and just find out what you’ve got going on, or where you’ve been going on any given day?” he said. “I just don’t think that the government needs a catch-all where they can obtain whatever information they want on you at a moment’s notice.”",

    "fullText": "Two Brownsville police officers helped a homeless man during a cold morning patrol\n\nBody camera footage of the encounter spread widely on social media\n\nOfficer Gonzalo Rubio says the moment reflects everyday acts of service that often go unseen\n\nA routine patrol through downtown Brownsville turned into a viral moment after two police officers stopped to help a homeless man on a cold morning. The interaction, later shared widely online, struck a chord far beyond the Texas city.\n\nAccording to the Brownsville Police Department, Officers Gonzalo Rubio and Francisco Maldonado encountered the man early in the morning while driving through the downtown area. The department said the officers noticed the chilly weather and realized the man needed warm, dry clothing.\n\n“Noticing the chilly weather and seeing that the man needed warm, dry clothing, the officers stepped in to help,” the department explained in a Facebook post,\n\nOfficer Rubio, who grew up in Brownsville, later reflected on the moment as part of everyday policing. “They’re not bothering anybody, they’re not doing anything wrong, and we just happen to be driving by,” he said of people often seen resting in the area.\n\nThe cold morning raised immediate concern when the officers saw the man trembling despite having a blanket. Rubio explained that when they tried to help, they realized the man wasn't wearing any pants, making the situation more urgent.\n\nAccording to Rubio, his partner immediately suggested buying clothing to keep the man warm. The officers worried the man might leave, so they asked dispatch to keep an eye on him while they went to purchase sweatpants.\n\nWhen the officers returned, the man was still there. It’s the moment they reunited with him and helped him get dressed that was captured on video by a nearby passerby.\n\nThe Brownsville Police Department later shared the body-worn camera footage on Facebook, calling it a moment of “service and humanity.” “In an act of compassion, Officers Rubio and Maldonado purchased new sweatpants for the man to ensure he stayed warm and comfortable,” the department wrote.\n\nAs the video spread, Rubio expressed surprise at the attention it received. “Sometimes it just goes away, like okay, whatever, that’s nice, but this one kept happening,” he said.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nRubio added that the viral clip showed only a small part of the job. “It was a rainy day, we still had 12 hours to go, so much other stuff happened that day that nobody knows about,” he said.\n\nFor the department, the moment reflected its broader mission. “The Brownsville Police Department is proud of our compassionate officers who continue to embody our commitment to serving our community with dignity, empathy, and respect,” the Facebook post concluded.",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M (13-4, 3-1 SEC) lost its first SEC game of the year on the road vs. No. 24 Tennessee, falling to the Vols in double overtime 87-82 in a game where the Aggies led until the final five minutes. Due to Tennessee's size advantage, which has been the case throughout SEC play, Texas A&M was outrebounded 60-35, including 24 offensive rebounds that led to more than 20 points.\n\nFirst-year head coach Bucky McMillan has had to resort to small ball after losing transfer forward Mackenzie Mgbako for the year, whose size and shooting ability would have likely resulted in a win on Tuesday, while starting forward Rashaun Agee, who is listed at 6'7\", but likely shorter, leads the Aggies in rebounding with 8.6 per game.\n\nStill, this is the hand McMillan has been dealt, and his team continues to play with a ton of heart and physicality, and should be 16-1 if it weren't for late-game issues against UCF, SMU, and the final seconds against Tennessee.\n\nHowever, the Aggies should have gotten the ball back with just under ten seconds remaining in regulation after senior guard Rylan Griffin's near rebound was hit out of bounds by a Tennessee player, but the refs apparently did not see enough evidence to overturn the call. Either way, missed free throws, finishing 21-32 from the stripe, ultimately cost the Aggies in the end.\n\nTexas A&M is ahead of schedule in Year 1 of McMillan's tenure in College Station, and while Tuesday's loss was frustrating for the fan base, ESPN bracketology expert Joe Lunardi was seemingly impressed with the Aggies' performance in one of the toughest environments the SEC has to offer, placing McMillan's veteran squad as one of the Last Four Byes alonside Kentucky, USC, and Wisconsin.\n\nStill, Texas A&M needs to pick up more Quad 1 wins to have any shot of making the NCAA Tournament, with another opportunity on Saturday night against rival Texas in Austin.\n\n— Joe Lunardi (@ESPNLunardi) January 14, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M rises in ESPN's Bracketology despite losing to Tennessee",

    "fullText": "The ultimate goal for every football player who laces up their cleats is to reach the NFL. That dream narrows quickly after high school, and even for those talented enough to play at the collegiate level, the odds of landing on a professional roster remain slim. But unlike several other sports, football requires a massive number of bodies to function, and scouts flock to end‑of‑season showcases for one reason: finding a diamond in the rough.\n\nTexas A&M has several players projected to come off the board within the first two days of the 2026 NFL Draft. For those athletes, skipping an All‑Star event might be the smart play. For others, these games represent a final opportunity to get in front of evaluators who could ultimately pound the table for them in draft rooms this spring.\n\nTaurean York has been a constant in Aggieland, staying through the coaching transition and emerging as the heartbeat of the defense. His football IQ, leadership, and command of the unit will be difficult to replace, but he played a major role in preparing the next wave of linebackers to take the reins. While he doesn’t boast prototypical size or elite speed, he consistently puts himself in a position to make plays and elevate those around him.\n\nAfter a historic junior season, York has officially declared for the 2026 NFL Draft and accepted an invitation to the East‑West Shrine Bowl. It’s a chance to showcase his instincts, intelligence, and competitiveness in front of NFL scouts one more time as he looks to solidify his place at the next level.\n\nInvitation Accepted@AggieFootball LB Taurean York (@TaureanYork5x) is locked in for the East-West Shrine Bowl! 👍#GigEm | #ShrineBowlWHOSNEXT 😎 pic.twitter.com/bOPLsOGjYv\n\n— East-West Shrine Bowl (@ShrineBowl) January 12, 2026\n\nThe 2026 East-West Shrine Bowl kicks off January 27 at Ford Center at The Star in Frisco, Texas\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes, and opinions.

    "description": "Rick Havacko decided to move to a new state after working remotely during the pandemic in California. He narrowed his choices to Austin or Nashville.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rick Havacko, a 58-year-old corporate communications lead in Austin. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWorking remotely during the pandemic was the springboard for my move from California to Texas. I was born and raised in Orange County. I realized that although I love Laguna Niguel, I didn't want to live the rest of my life there.\n\nIt's beautiful, but once you get outside the city, it's congested, and prices are high.\n\nI've worked for Toshiba Business for 13 years, and I've always been fully remote. After my employer approved my move, the choice was between Austin (where I had visited before and enjoyed) and Nashville, which I had heard great things about.\n\nAfter traveling to both places in the summer of 2021, I decided to make Austin my home.\n\nBoth areas featured all the benefits of city life with a rural feel. Nashville is an amazing city and very similar to Austin. It has great music, culture, and a very creative vibe with tons of energy.\n\nWhat drew me to Austin is that it has my gym, LA Fitness, so I felt like I could really hit the ground running.\n\nI've been here for about four and a half years, and it's been one of the best things I've ever done.\n\nGrowing up in Orange County, the furthest I ever went was to San Diego for college, which is so close I could come home anytime I wanted. Austin was my first permanent move, so I had a little trepidation.\n\nI remember driving all night past Camp Pendleton, finally arriving in Tucson, Arizona, to spend the night. I got there about 1 a.m., and I felt a lot of uncertainty, like, Am I really going to like this place?\n\nWhen I hit the Hill Country, just before Fredericksburg, and headed into Austin, I passed the beautiful sawgrass and oak trees, and a sense of calm enveloped me, giving me the feeling that I was in a good place.\n\nI moved to Dripping Springs, which is 20 miles west of downtown Austin. It's more affordable than Southern California and less congested, but ultimately, it came down to the energy of the city and its people.\n\nI look outside my window, and often see deer, foxes, wild turkey, and even a Longhorn steer walking by my fence. I would never experience that in Laguna Niguel. I love nature.\n\nI no longer have immediate family in California, but I miss my friends back home. Making new friends has been the biggest challenge I've faced, but I keep trying. I've joined a volleyball league and play soccer and softball, where I meet people.\n\nI miss the world-class beaches in California; here we're pretty landlocked. I'm also a huge Angels fan. I grew up following the team, and Toshiba has a suite at Angel Stadium, so I used to attend many games. I also enjoyed attending LA Galaxy games. For now, I've adopted the University of Texas Longhorns for football and baseball, and I go to those games.\n\nWhile Texans are not required to file a state income tax return (only a federal one), property taxes appear to be significantly higher here. Properties themselves, however, are relatively inexpensive here. My property here is about twice the size of my home in California, and it was less expensive.\n\nOverall, it's still cheaper to live here, although Austin is one of the priciest cities in Texas. Gas is more affordable in Austin, but other living costs are comparable. I kept my same salary when I moved.\n\nHere in Dripping Springs, you see people with big belt buckles and cowboy boots. It's cool and culturally different from Orange County.\n\nDowntown Austin is one of the most vibrant and exciting places on the planet. It bustles with positive energy, with live music at pretty much every turn, and the University of Texas at Austin adds to that vibe.\n\nI'm very happy here and plan to stay permanently.",

He arrives in El Paso after spending the past five years as president of Monterey Bay FC, another club competing in the USL Championship.\n\nGonzalez brings 25 years of coaching experience, with stops across Major League Soccer, the USL Championship and MLS NEXT Pro. Most recently, he served as head coach of LAFC II.\n\nGonzalez becomes the fifth head coach in El Paso Locomotive FC history.\n\nBoth DiGiulio and Gonzalez expressed excitement about leading the next chapter of the club as the Locomotive continue building their roster ahead of the 2026 season.\n\n“I’m extremely excited,” Gonzalez said. “I’ve been in quite a long journey, and I’ve been in many different environments for this opportunity, and I don’t take it lightly to be part of the community of El Paso. And our goal is to have success and win trophies, but also to develop young and veteran players to become a team and be good in the community.”\n\n“I have a real love for the sport,” DiGiulio said. “I have a real love for the league. I think the USL is a tremendous opportunity in the future. I believe what we have coming in the next several years is going to be special. My goal and our goal is to be one of those clubs that are the elite thought of clubs in USL.”\n\nEl Paso will open the season on March 7, hosting Colorado Springs Switchbacks FC at Southwest University Park.",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M's 2026 offensive line will feature four new starters after four 2025 veterans will depart due to expired eligibility, combined with declaring for the 2026 NFL Draft. Just a week after the transfer portal opened, head coach Mike Elko and O-line coach Adam Cushing went to work, landing four likely replacements, including former Aggie commit and LSU sophomore guard Coen Echols.\n\nWhile this group looks all but finished, Monday's news that former Texas A&M recruiting target and Colorado sophomore tackle Jordan Seaton will enter the transfer portal likely has every Power 4 coaching staff scrambling to arrange a visit in the coming days, including Mike Elko.\n\nSeaton, a five-star prospect in the 2024 recruiting class, spent last season as Colorado's starting left tackle, appearing in nine games, allowing just two sacks and seven total pressures, earning a Pro Football Focus pass pro grade of 83.9, including prolific grades of 91 against Houston and 91.5 against TCU.\n\nOn his way to becoming a first-round pick in the 2028 or 2029 NFL Draft, wherever he chooses to play next should be based on his development track. Immediately after the announcement, On3's Pete Nakos revealed that sources have told him that Oregon and Texas, two teams in need of starting-level tackles, are the primary contenders this early in the process, but also stated that Ole Miss, Texas Tech, LSU, Miami, and Texas A&M are also in the mix.\n\nKnowing that his NIL value is anywhere between $1 million and $2 million.5 mllion, give or take, I can safely say that Elko will at least \"kick the tires\" on the elite left tackle, even though the staff seems content with what they currently have in the building.\n\nNEW: Colorado OL Jordan Seaton plans to enter the NCAA transfer portal, @PeteNakos reports. \n\nSeaton was as Five-Star Plus+ in the 2024 class.https://t.co/MvGJiwwtfH pic.twitter.com/D4juA1jU4b\n\n— On3 (@On3sports) January 13, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M should be in the mix for Colorado transfer OL Jordan Seaton",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M's 2026 wide receiver rotation is all but complete after landing a massive commitment from Alabama transfer wideout Isaiah Horton, who, after entering the portal on Thursday, took one visit to College Station this weekend, and announced his intention to play for the Aggies on Sunday night.\n\nLast season, Texas A&M's one and only weakness in its wide receiver rotation was the lack of size on the boundary, which also hurt the red zone offense, lacking a 50/50 deep shot threat that could stretch the field and help starting quarterback Marcel Reed spread the ball around at every level of the field.\n\nWith the return of star wide receiver Mario Craver, along with ascending wideouts Ashton Bethel-Roman and Terry Bussey, combined with several incoming freshmen, speed and separation aren't an issue, and Horton provides stability as a man-beater on the outside to create chunk gains and open up the offense.\n\nLast season, Marcel Reed threw for 3,192 yards and 25 touchdowns, with seven of those scores coming off deep shots of 20 yards or more, while his 39% completion percentage on those throws should improve with Horton's size posing an advantage. While five of his eleven interceptions came between the numbers, four were thrown along the left boundary, mainly due to the lack of size at wide receiver against average-sized defensive backs.\n\nMario Craver is one of the fastest players in college football, but is a mere 5'9\", and should have his best season yet in the Z or slot receiver role with Hortmon on the field, as the coverage will now have to focus on the Alabama transfer, especially if he finds early success in SEC play.\n\nBarring any changes, including Auburn transfer WR Malcolm Simmon's impending decision and Colorado transfer receiver Dre'Lon Miller's visit to College Station this weekend, Isaiah Hortmon looks like the final piece of the puzzle for Texas A&M's 2026 wide receiver corps.\n\nIf the 2025 Texas A&M WR group had one weakness, it was their lack of a big-bodied WRs who can be an outside man beater and grab 50-50 balls. New A&M WR Isaiah Horton can be that guy and led Alabama with eight receiving TDs in 2025. pic.twitter.com/Ui86ViPjcQ\n\n— Carter Karels (@CarterKarels) January 11, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M's 2026 WR corps looks complete after adding Isaiah Horton",

    "fullText": "Yet another data center will soon emerge near the Far Westside of San Antonio, according to a recent Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) filing. It's set to further the Lone Star State's reputation as a tech cluster.\n\nThe quaint town of Castroville, with a population of just over 3,000, will soon house a $400 million development owned by Microsoft. Online records show that the project, named SAT 82, will take up roughly 195,000 square feet in Medina County.\n\nAlthough it's only a one-story building, it will take nearly two years to build, according to the TDLR. Construction at the spot, 3580 FM 471 North, will begin on Thursday, August 13, 2026. A visit to the property revealed that equipment and a welcome poster were already on site. An open field, a two-lane road, and residential properties sit nearby.\n\nIn time, the structure will likely take on the look of a windowless warehouse. It may be hard for residents to get a clear glimpse of the center, as each contains extensive fencing around its perimeters for safety and security purposes, Microsoft's website states.\n\nSAT 82 joins six others in Medina County, according to the TDLR: SAT 80, SAT 81, SAT 89/90, SAT 93, SAT 94, and another with the title SAT 82, but with a different address.\n\nThe centers provide the infrastructure needed to open a phone application, join a virtual Zoom meeting, play an online game, and more. According to the company's website, they also allow the company's Azure cloud platform, AI, and collaboration tools to continue operating as normal.\n\nEarlier this fall, community members in a private Redbird Ranch neighborhood Facebook group voiced concerns over Microsoft's presence in the area. A few users worried the company's projects would worsen traffic. Others highlighted the massive amount of water that data centers use.\n\nIn a 2024 sustainability report, Microsoft said that its water consumption in 2023 - which includes but is not limited to data centers - increased by 1.7 billion gallons from the previous year, coming in at 2.1 billion gallons. The company attributed the increase to its business growth.\n\n\"Improvements as part of our Redmond campus modernization project are estimated to yield over 50% reduction in water use for new facilities,\" it continued in the report.\n\nConstruction on the property is expected to wrap up by 2028, according to the TDLR.\n\nThis article originally published at Microsoft bets $400M on tiny Texas town with new massive data center.",

    "fullText": "After missing his \"College Gameday\" appearance before the Aggies competed against the Hurricanes in the first round of the CFP, former Heisman-winning quarterback and Texas A&M legend Johnny Manziel explained his side of the story on his Glory Daze podcast.\n\nAccording to Manziel, he missed the scheduled appearance as a guest picker due to a virus that made him sick the night before. He originally planned to attend with music artist Drake and watch Texas A&M take on Miami, but the illness prevented that.\n\nManziel played for the Aggies in 2012 and 2013, becoming the first-ever freshman Heisman winner and just the second player to win the award in program history. Here is the full clip of Manziel discussing the incident that led to his missed appearance.\n\nFormer Texas A&M QB Johnny Manziel explained on his podcast what went into him missing his scheduled “College GameDay” appearance for A&M vs. Miami. He said he planned to go to the game with Drake but got sick the night before with an “unbelievable” virus. https://t.co/jYbSoxsig8 pic.twitter.com/Z7guLzSghd\n\n— Carter Karels (@CarterKarels) January 8, 2026\n\nWhile rumors ran rampant across social media when former Aggie basketball player Alex Caruso was named the guest picker in place of Manziel, he seemed to shut those down on the most recent episode of his podcast. Manziel was in attendance for multiple contests at Kyle Field in 2025, while also spending time with current Texas A&M quarterback Marcel Reed, who displayed much improvement this season at the helm and will return to play for the Maroon and White for his junior season.\n\nThe year didn't conclude as the Aggies had wished, but head coach Mike Elko has led the program to historic heights in just his second season coaching in Bryan-College Station, Texas.

    "fullText": "Texas A&M (13-3, 3-0 SEC) stayed undefeated in the SEC after defeating Oklahoma 83-76 on Saturday night, aided by four Aggies scoring in double figures, led by senior forward Rashuan Agee's 16 points and 12 rebounds for his seventh double-double on the year. In attendance, Texas A&M football head coach Mike Elko hosted several key transfer portal players, who collectively enjoyed one of the weekend's best games.\n\nOn Friday night, it was revealed that the Aggies were set to host Alabama transfer wide receiver Isaiah Horton amid Auburn star receiver Cam Coleman's impending decision, and while Horton was not in attendance for the game, Elko was accompanied by former Aggie recruiting target and Colorado transfer receiver Dre'Lon Miller and Illinois transfer defensive tackle Angelo McCullom.\n\nAnother confirmed visitor, Miami transfer DL Donta Simpson Jr, further proves that Elko and his staff are looking add more beef to the defensive line after landing standout transfer edge rushers Ryan Henderson and Anto Naka, who will look to replace unanimous All-American Cashius Howell. Landing either McCullom or Simpson, or both, would complete the 2026 defensive line room.\n\nCam Coleman's recent visit to Alabama could put the Crimson Tide ahead of the Aggies, Texas, and Texas Tech, but that's yet to be determined after the Alabama native returned home before making his final decision. Landing Isaiah Horton wouldn't just be insurance if Coleman isn't an option, but an elite addition to an already established, yet undersized WR Room.\n\nLastly, Dre'Lon Miller is a familiar face who was underutilized during his time at Colorado, and while he doesn't possess Horton's size, his speed and versatility would make up for KC Concepcion's departure.\n\nUpdate: Some conflicting info on the Horton ID in video. Certain on Miller and McCollum. https://t.co/yimkbovBC5\n\n— 𝕋𝕣𝕒𝕧𝕚𝕤 𝕃.

    "fullText": "According to On3’s Hayes Fawcett, the Texas Longhorns have landed a commitment from linebacker Rasheem Biles out of the NCAA transfer portal. Biles spent the last two seasons with the Pitt Panthers, turning into an All-ACC player. Steve Sarkisian and new defensive coordinator Will Muschamp now take over his talents, hoping it translates in the SEC.\n\nLinebacker has been a position of importance for Texas in the transfer portal this offseason. There has been plenty of turnover there, both due to the 2026 NFL Draft and guys leaving for other schools. Somebody with the ability to bring an immediate impact was needed in Austin, and Biles is the guy.\n\nBiles played in 10 games last season for Pitt, starting in nine of them. A total of 101 tackles, 17 tackles for a loss, and 4.5 interceptions proved to be good enough for second-team All-ACC honors. You can add in two interceptions (both of which were returned for touchdowns), six passes defended, two forced fumbles, and a fumble recovery. Basically, Biles was all over the field this past year.\n\nIf those stats were not enough, the On3 Industry Transfer Portal rankings believe one of the very best is heading to Texas. Biles is a four-star prospect and the No. 16 overall player to enter this cycle. Nobody is ranked higher when it comes to the linebacker position, either.\n\nPlenty of other schools were interested in Biles’ commitment during the transfer process. The likes of Colorado, Miami, Michigan, and Ohio State were a part of the discussion at one point. Instead, Texas found a way to get this one over the finish line.\n\nThe Longhorns are coming off a disappointing season, going 9-3 and missing the College Football Playoff. Sarkisian is working to retool the roster so the same fate is not shared at the conclusion of the 2026 season. Plenty of work remains but snagging somebody like Biles is a massive step in the right direction.\n\nTexas will open the ’26 campaign on Sept. 5 vs. Texas State, where you can assume it will be debut day for Biles. One week later will grab all the attention, though, as Ohio State comes to Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium for the first time since 2006.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire. The On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M's 2026 running back room could feature a new face from the transfer portal, and while Baylor transfer back Bryson Washington made his way to College Station this weekend, Washington is now in the mix for the Texas native, which have have made a significant push this week. However, this doesn't rule out the Aggies landing a transfer running back, as a new name has emerged.\n\nAccording to AggieYell insider Jaxson Callaway, Texas A&M is now targeting Michigan State transfer running back Makhi Frazier, who is reportedly coming off a Friday visit to Ohio State. While this may seem daunting, the Aggies have won multiple transfer battles against the Buckeyes this month. Still, adding another running back isn't A&M's top priority compared to other programs.\n\nWashington is still the No. 1 running back target for head coach Mike Elko and his staff, and Callaway is right to state that the rest of the RB portal market will depend on Washington's choice regarding which way the Huskies will go.\n\n\"At the moment, much of the running back market appears to be waiting on Washington’s decision.\"\n\nFocusing on Frazier, the McKinney, Texas native is listed at 5'10\" and nearly 220 pounds, and is coming off an impressive 2025 sophomore campaign after rushing for 520 yards and two touchdowns, averaging 4.5 yards per carry.\n\nPer Pro Football Focus, Frazier earned a solid offensive grade (74.8) and a rushing grade (77.6), which bodes well for his future as a potential starting or No. 2 running back. Frazier will continue to be a name to watch, but until Bryson Washington makes his decision, both players will be the top backs on the Aggies' radar.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Transfer RB Makhi Frazier has emerged as a Texas A&M target",

    "fullText": "The Alabama Crimson Tide will host the Texas Longhorns at Coleman Coliseum on Saturday night.\n\nThe Tide enter the matchup following a Top 15 road loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, as a multitude of injuries ultimately cost Alabama the game. Labaron Philon Jr. recorded 18 points on 5-of-9 shooting despite playing just 19 minutes, as the star guard left the game with full-body cramps and was unable to return in the second half.\n\nAden Holloway and Latrell Wrightsell could see an increase in playing time, should Philon remain sidelined, but the Tide will look to get the sharpshooter back from injury as soon as possible, starting with this game against Texas.\n\nHere are three bold takes for Alabama's matchup against Texas.\n\nHolloway recorded 22 points on 9-of-18 shooting during Wednesday night's loss, as the junior guard was able to step up and play at an elite level following Philon's injury. The former Auburn star could thrive once again if Philon is unable to play, as the sharpshooter has proven to shine with an increased workload on numerous occasions in the past. Holloway is currently shooting an impressive 46.7% from behind the arc, as the star will look to stay hot on Saturday evening.\n\nSherrell has played a critical role on both ends of the floor for the Crimson Tide. The talented big man currently leads the team in blocks with 2.8 per game, and Sherrell's presence on the glass has undoubtedly been missed while he has been sidelined. The sophomore forward could be in prime position for a major performance should he return on Saturday night, as the Tide continue to slowly get healthier as the season progresses.\n\nAllen has continued to turn heads throughout the first few months of the 2025-26 season. The impressive freshman led the Crimson Tide in points with 25 during Wednesday night's loss in Nashville, as Allen has quickly earned himself a much larger role and has thrived in recent weeks. Allen could benefit from Philon's injury should he remain out on Saturday, but ultimately the freshman could still be in for another big night nonetheless.\n\nContact/Follow us @RollTideWire on X, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Alabama news, notes and opinion.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Roll Tide Wire: Alabama basketball bold predictions for game vs. Texas Longhorns",

The college student was found dead at the bottom of an apartment complex. The Austin Police Department suggested that Aguilera took her own life, though the cheerleader's mother strongly disagreed.\n\nStephanie Rodriguez, the mother of the deceased cheerleader, ripped Austin Police for their investigation.\n\n“Please don’t believe this lazy investigator and Investigation!” Stephanie Rodriguezwrote on Facebook.\n\nNow, the parents of the cheerleader have filed a $1 million lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed against Austin Blacks Rugby Club and the University of Texas’ Latin Economics and Business Association. The seven-figure lawsuit accuses the two school organizations of allegedly serving their daughter alcohol before her death.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Aguilera was served her first drink around 6 p.m. She was allegedly continued to be served drinks for several hours, before stumbling away. Aguilera ended up at an apartment where she was supposed to spend the night. Ultimately, she fell to her death around midnight.\n\n“We believe even more today this was not a suicide as has been suggested by police. This was either an accident or something much more sinister,” Tony Buzbee, lead attorney with the Buzbee Law Firm, who is representing Aguilera’s parents, said at a press conference.\n\nHe added: “If the police department will not do its job, then we will do it for them.\"\n\nThe police said that they found a deleted suicide note on Aguilera's phone. However, attorneys representing Aguilera's family say that it was just a drafted essay.\n\nAn official cause of death has yet to be released. An investigation into the death remains to be underway.",

    "fullText": "In what increasingly resembles NFL free agency, the transfer portal now commands more attention than National Signing Day or even the early signing period. Love it or hate it, it isn’t going anywhere—and every program in the country feels its impact.\n\nBut the portal also gives players the same flexibility coaches enjoy: the ability to leave when a better opportunity presents itself. On Thursday, former Texas A&M redshirt junior tight end Theo Melin Öhrström found exactly that, landing with an ACC‑bound program not too far from Aggieland.\n\nAccording to On3Sports’ Hayes Fawcett, Öhrström will join the SMU Mustangs for the 2026 season and is expected to arrive in Dallas with up to two years of eligibility remaining. The former four‑star prospect stayed through the coaching transition in College Station and continued to make steady progress, earning more snaps as his career unfolded. He was firmly in the mix to start for the Aggies in 2026, but ultimately opted for a fresh start.\n\nAt SMU, he’ll have a much clearer path as the main focus at the position and can serve as the veteran presence in a young tight end room next season.\n\nYou can see his announcement below.\n\nBREAKING: Texas A&M transfer TE Theo Melin Ohrstrom has Committed to SMU, he tells @On3Sports\n\nHe totaled 352 yards and 3 TDs in his time with the Aggieshttps://t.co/RlUbB6Fk7q pic.twitter.com/sYJsfYzlSk\n\n— Hayes Fawcett (@Hayesfawcett3) January 8, 2026\n\nThe NCAA football transfer portal opened Jan. 2 and runs through Jan. 16.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions.

    "description": "\"There’s a lot of story to be written.\"",
    "fullText": "A critically endangered large bird is getting a helping hand with the opening of a large sanctuary on the Gulf Coast.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that the Wolfberry Whooping Crane Sanctuary will provide a vital wintering ground for the 550 cranes that migrate each winter to Texas from Canada.\n\nThe $8.4 million land acquisition was a joint venture between different conservation groups. It marks a key next step in the crane's recovery from the brink of extinction in the 1940s.\n\nThe whooping crane's numbers dipped to just 21 individuals in the wild, 16 in Texas, because of extensive destruction of wetlands and illegal hunting.\n\nRising sea levels are further eroding the crane's breeding grounds. They were one of the first species listed under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.\n\nCarter Crouch, director of the Gulf Coast programs for the International Crane Foundation, hailed the progress made while acknowledging the challenges ahead:\n\n\"We have a long way to go still, so there's a lot of story to be written, and I'm super excited to be a small part of that.\"\n\nThe whooping crane is a striking bird that typically stands about five feet tall with white feathers and a distinctive red patch on its head. Its name reveals its other defining characteristic: very loud vocalizations.\n\nLike other cranes, they play an important role in maintaining the balance of the food web in wetlands by keeping prey populations under control and spreading nutrients. They are also considered an indicator species, meaning their presence is a sign of a healthy ecosystem.\n\nWhile still in a precarious state, they are resilient birds with a long lifespan, so there's good reason to be optimistic for their future.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nAnother promising note is another rare crane's remarkable comeback on the other side of the world. It shows what's possible with effective local and international cooperation to protect threatened species.\n\nSupporting such efforts with your time or money can make a huge difference.\n\nAn Instagram post from Saving Cranes (@savingcranes) about the story garnered several positive comments.\n\n\"Great win conserving one of the earth's great habitats for wildlife for future generations!\" read one.\n\nAnother happy commenter added, \"Bravo! Thank You! Congratulations!\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Texas A&M beat Auburn 90-88 on Tuesday night after a review determined that a buzzer-beater didn't quite get off in time.",
    "fullText": "KeShawn Murphy thought he had hit a ridiculous deep buzzer-beater to lift Auburn past Texas A&M on Tuesday night.\n\nMurphy, with Auburn down by two points, caught an inbounds pass with just 0.6 seconds left on the clock, turned and fired. His shot was perfect, and sparked a massive celebration at Neville Arena. The shot looked like it was one of the first truly great buzzer-beaters of the college basketball season, several months before March even hit.\n\nBut unfortunately for Murphy and the Tigers, a review from the officials determined that the release was just a little too late. Murphy didn’t get the shot off in time, and the points were called off. That gave the Aggies the 90-88 road win, and left them celebrating in front of a stunned arena instead.\n\nWILD ENDING 🤯 \n\nThis supposed buzzer-beater from Auburn was overturned after review to give Texas A&M the win. pic.twitter.com/oxjZEHlWGH\n\n— SEC Network (@SECNetwork) January 7, 2026\n\n\"I don't have a clear understanding still,\" Auburn coach Steven Pearl said, via WSFA12's Rosie Langello-Hodgens. \"I still gotta gather more information and get an understanding as to what their determination was ... Just from the angles that I saw, it looked like the ball was out of his hands on the red light, on the scoreboard that we were looking at. But I would imagine that they had a different angle they were looking at to determine the ball wasn't out of his hands.\"\n\nPearl had a conversation with the SEC after the game, and he was seen meeting with athletic director John Cohen and officials on the court well after speaking with reporters.\n\nTexas A&M rallied from a 16-point hole to grab the win over the Tigers, which got them to 12-3 on the season and kept them a perfect 2-0 in SEC play. Pop Isaacs led the way with 21 points off the bench after he shot 7-of-12 from the field, and Jacari Lane added 17 points and seven rebounds. The Aggies have now won five straight entering Saturday's game with Oklahoma.\n\nKeyshawn Hall led Auburn with 32 points and 12 rebounds in the loss, and Kevin Overton finished with 16 points. Murphy had eight points and eight rebounds. The Tigers have now lost four of their last six, and fell to 9-6 on the season — which is the first under Pearl, who took over for his father, longtime coach Bruce Pearl, this past offseason. They’ll head into Saturday’s game with No. 15 Arkansas without an SEC win looking to avoid what would be the program’s first three-game losing skid since 2023.",

    "fullText": "Texas transfer redshirt freshman wide receiver Parker Livingstone has committed to rival Oklahoma, On3’s Hayes Fawcett and Pete Nakos report.\n\nLivingstone, who was a four-star recruit out of Lovejoy in the 2024 class, exploded onto the scene for the Longhorns in 2025. The Lucas, TX native hauled in 29 receptions for 516 yards and six touchdowns. He caught two passes for 29 yards in Texas’ 23-6 win over Oklahoma on Oct. 11.\n\nThe departure of Livingstone came as a big blow to Texas starting quarterback Arch Manning, who was Livingstone’s roommate in Austin. As news of his transfer emerged, Manning posted an Instagram story of him and Livingstone with a teary-eyed emoji.\n\nLivingstone now joins an Oklahoma program fresh off an appearance in the College Football Playoff. The Sooners went up 17-0 over Alabama in their First Round matchup, but were outscored 34-7 over the remainder of the game in a 34-24 loss.\n\nDespite the loss, head coach Brent Venables made it clear how proud he was of both the players returning next season and those moving on: “We couldn’t have done it if they didn’t stick with it, if they didn’t continue to believe when a lot of the things were going on around them,” Venables elaborated. “They could’ve bowed out, and they chose not to.”\n\nAlthough it appeared he could be one of the top quarterback prospects in the 2026 NFL Draft following a red-hot start to the season, quarterback John Mateer will likely return to Norman for his redshirt senior. season. In 12 games this season, Mateer completed 62.2% of passes for 2,885 yards and 14 touchdowns with 11 interceptions. He also totaled 431 yards and eight scores on the ground.\n\nMateer addressed his future immediately following the Sooners’ loss to the Crimson Tide. He was non-committal when discussing what’s next for his football career. “I haven’t really thought about it yet,” Mateer said. “I’m pretty sure I’ll take some time and weigh all the options and we’ll see.”\n\nESPN’s Kirk Herbstreit however implored Mateer to return to Norman next season. “Why would he leave a place that’s become home? I guess if someone paid him,” Herbstreit said. “My guess is, he’s going back to OU.”\n\nWith Mateer and Livingstone leading the OU offense, back-to-back College Football Playoff appearances are certainly the expectation for the Sooner faithful.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.\n\nThe On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.",

    "description": "Texas A&M left guard Chase Bisontis has declared for the 2026 NFL Draft after three impressive seasons.",
    "fullText": "Texas A&M's offensive line will look very different in 2026, as head coach Mike Elko and O-line coach Adam Cushing will need to replace four starters, now including junior left guard Chase Bisontis, who has officially declared for the 2026 NFL Draft after three successful seasons in College Station.\n\nA New Jersey native, Bisontis chose the Aggies over Rutgers in the 2023 recruiting class, bringing elite size and versatility at 6'5\" and 315 pounds, and during his first season with the Aggies, Bisontis started at right tackle amid former head coach Jimbo Fisher's final season at the helm.\n\nAfter Fisher was dismissed, Mike Elko felt that Adam Cushing was the perfect choice to help Bisontis reach his full potential, slotting him at left guard, where he has dominated ever since. Logging 1,962 snaps in his Texas A&M career, including 795 snaps, all at left guard during the 2025 season. Bisontis's elite strength will quickly translate to the next level, knowing that NFL scouts see him as a \"plug-and-play\" option at left or right guard.\n\nPro Football Focus graded Bisontis as an above-average pass protector (70.7) and average run blocker (62.7). Still, these grades, compared to most SEC starting guards, prove the level of defensive competition within the conference.\n\nOver the last three days, Texas A&M landed commitments from LSU transfer guard Coen Echols and South Carolina guard Trovon Baugh, which now makes even more sense given today's news. Needing size and SEC experience at left and right guard is key to avoiding a substantial drop-off in the trenches, and credit to Mike Elko for preparing for the inevitable.\n\nTexas A&M OL Chase Bisontis has declared for the 2026 NFL Draft, per his Instagram (chase_bisontis) 👍 #GigEm @CBisontis pic.twitter.com/iQfPNJsSQI\n\n— Luke Evangelist (@lukeevangelist_) January 6, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M star OL Chase Bisontis has declared for the 2026 NFL Draft",

    "fullText": "Jan 6 (Reuters) - One of the first police officers on the scene of the 2022 attack at a Texas elementary school that killed 19 students and two ​teachers is now the first to stand trial, accused of failing to act ‌as the gunman continued one of the deadliest mass killings targeting students in U.S. history.\n\nOpening arguments were to begin ‌Tuesday in the trial of Adrian Gonzales, 52, who was a member of the school district police force. Hundreds of officers from local, state and federal agencies waited 77 minutes before entering a classroom where the gunman was holed up. Teachers and children made lengthy calls to 911 emergency ⁠services, saying they were in the ‌room with the gunman and surrounded by bodies.\n\nGonzales was charged in 2024 with 29 counts of child endangerment, according to his indictment, which said ‍that he \"failed to engage, distract, and delay the shooter\" and that he also failed \"to follow his active shooter training to respond to gun fire by advancing toward the gun fire.\"\n\nEach count carries the possibility of ​two years in prison. Gonzales has pleaded not guilty. Gonzales' attorney, Nico LaHood, has said ‌that his client showed up to help children, and that he did in fact help many evacuate.\n\nPedro \"Pete\" Arredondo, the former chief of the Uvalde schools police and the person who investigators say was the officer in charge of the scene, faces 10 counts of the same charge. His trial has not yet been scheduled.\n\nState and federal investigations into the shooting found that officers ⁠left the 18-year-old gunman alone inside the classroom with ​children while weighing how to confront him.\n\nDebates between proponents ⁠of gun control measures and defenders of the constitutional right to bear arms have resulted in few restrictions on firearms in the United States compared to other industrialized ⁠nations.\n\nFormer U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, in remarks made while presenting the federal report on Uvalde in 2024, said ‌that \"lives would have been saved\" had the police immediately confronted the gunman.",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M landed its seventh transfer addition since the portal opened on Monday afternoon, securing its second offensive line commitment, as South Carolina guard Trovon Baugh will head to College Station this spring, and I can safely say that this one came out of nowhere. After landing LSU guard and former Texas A&M commit Coen Echols, head coach Mike Elko has added more beef in the trenches.\n\nWith starting left tackle Trey Zuhn, right guard Ar'maj Reed-Adams, and right tackle Dametreous Crownover all departing for the NFL Draft, landing two experienced offensive linemen was crucial before entering the spring season, while left guard Chase Bisontis has yet to decide his playing future. For those who aren't familiar with Baugh, he started 11 of 12 games at right guard for the Gamecocks last season, logging 611 snaps, while his overall performance is a mixed bag with more positives than negatives.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Focus, Baugh earned average grades, but did finish the year with four 80-plus pass protection grades, and earned at least 50 or above grades as a run blocker, proving that there's still plenty of room for improvement. On paper, with Adams leaving, Baugh will likely compete with Coen Echols and sophomore guard Blake Ivy for the starting right guard spot.\n\nStanding at 6'3\" and 335 pounds, Baugh possesses NFL size and strength, but still needs to refine his technique to reach his full potential. Mike Elko has filled another gap in the roster.\n\nMore beef 🥩 \n\nWelcome to Aggieland, @BaughTrovon 👍 pic.twitter.com/To8BGNl1i2\n\n— TexAgs Recruiting (@TA_Recruiting) January 5, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M land commitment from South Carolina transfer OL Trovon Baugh",

    "title": "I moved from California to Texas for love. After 6 months, I realized the state and relationship weren't right for me.",
    "description": "I followed a partner to Texas from California, then left both the state and relationship. I learned an important lesson about making my own decisions.",
    "fullText": "Shortly after earning my Bachelor's degree, I did what any confused 21-year-old would do: I moved to be with a partner.\n\nThe decision surprised a lot of people in my life. My dad raised his eyebrows at my choice to move for love and to make Texas my home.\n\nAfter all, I'd always dreamed of moving to New York, where I'd launch my writing career.\n\nHowever, moving to Texas seemed like a good option at the time. It's where my long-distance partner was living and working, and I was fresh out of college and eager to leave my California hometown.\n\nLooking back now, I was leaning on a romanticized version of what moving would mean — a fresh start and a deepening of our LDR — instead of thinking about what I really wanted.\n\nI arrived in northern Texas during a mid-summer nightmare of humidity. I couldn't walk outside without feeling like I'd just entered a sauna — a sharp contrast to California's dry heat.\n\nFrom the very beginning, I tried to find community and make living here work, convincing myself I'd adjust if I just put in enough effort.\n\nBut I had a tough time finding things to do in my new suburb. Quiet nights and weekends left me daydreaming about New York City and its seemingly endless array of activities and events even more.\n\nCrucially, I also found it incredibly difficult to meet anyone who felt similar to me.\n\nMy Dallas suburb felt much more conservative than my California hometown, and a lot of the people in our neighborhood were avid churchgoers, whereas I'm not religious.\n\nAround this time, too, I was coming to terms with the fact that I also liked women romantically. I struggled to find the kinds of queer spaces that seemed more plentiful in larger cities and bluer states.\n\nAs much as I tried to appreciate the mountainless views and endless selection of barbecue, I struggled to connect with my new town — and I couldn't stop thinking about the life I wanted in New York.\n\nSix months in, I took a quick trip back to California to visit my dad.\n\nTaking some time away from Texas made me confront the truth: I couldn't stay there anymore.\n\nThroughout my entire time in the state, I'd been daydreaming about packing up my things and living in New York City. My partner, on the other hand, wanted life in the country, and we just ended up not being compatible.\n\nThe Lone Star State helped bring all of these realizations to light.\n\nI knew that if I had chosen to stay, I'd continue to feel like a stranger in my own life. I realized that I'd rather take on the \"sunk cost\" of moving than stay in a place and relationship that didn't suit me.\n\nI learned a lot about myself during this time — including the fact that, maybe unsurprisingly, a suburb in northern Texas was not a great long-term fit for me. The biggest lesson I learned, though, was never to give up my own hopes and dreams for the sake of a relationship.\n\nDon't get me wrong: Moving for a partner can work for some people, but at 21, I learned the importance of making life decisions with my own wants and needs in mind.\n\nNow, almost a decade later, I'm writing this from my New York City apartment. I'm in a city where I've found my purpose, the love of my life, and most importantly, happiness.\n\nLeaving Texas turned out to be one of the best decisions I've ever made.",

AT&T said it has been developing the plan for the new headquarters for the past year.\n\nSeveral north Dallas suburbs are among the fastest-growing cities and towns in the US, and AT&T's spokesperson said the new campus will be closer to where many employees live.\n\nIn a memo to employees, which Business Insider obtained, CEO John Stankey acknowledged feedback about expectations for \"well-maintained and functional workspaces\" that were raised in an engagement survey last year.\n\n\"This is an investment intended to put the employee experience at the center of our workspace,\" Stankey said.",

Standing at 6'3\" and 255 pounds, Gregory would replace outgoing edge Rylan Kennedy, possessing a similar build and having already proven an ability to rush the passer at a high level.\n\nAccording to On3's Hayes Fawcett, Texas A&M has shown interest and could set up a visit as soon as next week.

    "title": "Micah's takeaways from a dominant week for the Big Ten",
    "description": "Indiana embarrassed Alabama and Oregon shut out Texas Tech. The Big Ten showed it has the best teams in CFB and is guaranteed to play for the title",
    "fullText": "It was a great week for the Big Ten The national championship game is guaranteed to have a team that resides in the Big Ten Conference. The title game won't feature two Big Ten teams, but there is no doubt that the best game in this playoff and the best game this season might be the upcoming semifinal between two Big Ten teams, Indiana and Oregon.\n\nHere are my takeaways from the Big Ten from this Week's bowl games:\n\nFrom wins like Iowa over Vandy, Illinois over Tennessee, a high-powered offense, all the way to Indiana beating Alabama, the Big Ten showcased they are the best conference in the country. The Big Ten lost Ohio State as a representative, but with the matchup between Oregon and Indiana, that could very well be the team that wins it all. Indiana very well looks like the best team remaining by a wide margin. Texas did get the best of Michigan, but everyone is clearly aware of what has been going on in Michigan prior to that bowl game. It is safe to say that the Big Ten runs college football.\n\nAgainst Alabama, Fernando Mendoza was as good as he could possibly be. Mendoza was 14-16, threw for 192 yards through the air, and threw for 3 passing touchdowns. Many of his other counterparts struggled, while Mendoza continues to win and continues to be the reason why Indiana is winning. At this current moment, Mendoza looks like a sure thing quarterback prospect for the next draft class, and he will make one desperate NFL team very happy.\n\nIndiana was the one team that had a bye week in the College Football Playoff that did not lose. Not only did they not lose to Alabama, but they won the game in the first half. Ty Simpson had no chance, and this was a complete football performance by Indiana and Curt Cignetti. The Hoosiers are undefeated this year, and last season they only lost two games, one of which was in last season's College Football Playoff. Cignetti consistently has this team ready to dominate regardless of the opponent. He has a Big Ten title for the first time in program history, and he is looking for much more this season. This two-year run for Cignetti in Indiana places him as the best coach in college football right now, and it is not close, just like the coaching match between him and Kalen DeBoer on Thursday.\n\nIndiana is a team that has not shown any weakness this season. In games that could have resulted in an upset this season, Indiana has a guy who can win them games in the clutch in Fernando Mendoza. This team has an elite quarterback, they have elite weapons as Omar Cooper Jr. returned versus Alabama, and their defense is just as good as any team left. This team is well coached, and their team is full of players at every level who have been in college football for at least 4 years. The steamrolling of Alabama was a surprise to no one. Indiana made their statement on Thursday and proved it is the team to beat.\n\nThe last time these two teams met, Indiana won 30-20. That game was a battle, and both quarterbacks struggled and faced adversity. Mendoza proved to be the quarterback who battled adversity the best. Against Indiana was the first time Dante Moore struggled and did not have his usual success. For Oregon to win, they will need Dante Moore to be the better quarterback. In all the other areas on their team, Oregon matches up very well against Indiana, and their defense showed that by completely shutting out Texas Tech. Once again, these two teams will deliver one of the best games of this season. In my opinion, whoever wins this game will win the whole thing.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: Big Ten football teams handled the SEC in New Year's bowl games",

Gideon, a four-year safety at Texas, played for Muschamp in Austin. He was the safeties coach for Steve Sarkisian until 2025, when he left for Atlanta.\n\nAfter running the defense for the Yellow Jackets this season, Gideon is returning to his alma mater. The 36-year-old played safety at Texas from 2008 through 2011. He got his first coaching role in 2014 and has climbed the career ladder for 11 years. Gideon served as the Longhorns’ safety coach for four seasons before accepting his first defensive coordinator position with Georgia Tech. Georgia Tech ended the season the 99th-ranked defense in FBS.\n\nIn December, Texas coach Steve Sarkisian parted ways with Pete Kwiatkowski and replaced him with Muschamp. Sark said in the announcement he'd like to spend less time worrying about the defense.\n\nGeorgia Tech defensive coordinator Blake Gideon is returning to Texas as an assistant for Steve Sarkisian and Will Muschamp, @InsideTexas' @EricNahlin has learned.\n\nGideon, who played 52 games for UT, was on Sarkisian's original staff from 2021-24\n\nSTORY (FREE):… pic.twitter.com/8PyEk451sJ\n\n— Inside Texas (@InsideTexas) January 2, 2026\n\n\"We just felt it was best for our program to move in a different direction, and having the opportunity to hire Will Muschamp provides us the leadership to take our defense to another level,\" Sark said in the press release. \"Will is a guy I've known for a long time, always admired and is as good of a defensive mind and coach as I've ever coached against. His defenses are relentless; he absolutely gets the best out of his staff and players and is such an extremely well-respected coach. I know Longhorn Nation knows him well, he led some incredible defenses here on the Forty, and I'm so fired up to be bringing him back to Texas.

Things became worrisome defensively when Tech allowed 48 points to NC State, ending Tech’s undefeated run at 8-0, and then followed it up by allowing 34 points to 1-win Boston College, then going down 28-0 to Pitt in just over a quarter of play.\n\nOn the plus side, Tech’s defense did hold georgia to only 16 points.\n\nWith Gideon’s departure, the Jackets currently have vancancies in both offensive and defensive coordinator. Former OC Buster Faulkner left to become Florida’s OC under John Sumrall before the Pop-Tarts Bowl. Gideon was the third full-time defensive coordinator to coach under head coach Brent Key, who now seeks his fourth defensive coordinator since taking over in 2022.",

    "fullText": "Texas ‘confident’ in landing $1.8 million transfer weapon for Arch Manning originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe old saying still applies: Everything is bigger in the state of Texas — including the NIL budget for the Texas Longhorns.\n\nTexas hasn’t exactly been shy about its spending over the past few years in its pursuit of the program’s first national championship since 2005. Even back in 2024, Lamborghini Austin — one of the Longhorns’ most visible NIL supporters — lined up luxury vehicles to help entice incoming recruits.\n\nThe dealership has previously signed former Texas stars Bijan Robinson and Jordan Whittington. Now, it appears Lamborghini Austin could be involved again as the Longhorns pursue one of the top players in the transfer portal: former Auburn wide receiver Cam Coleman.\n\nAs of January 2, Coleman is visiting Austin, and Texas is feeling optimistic about its chances.\n\n“Texas’ confidence is high that they can land the talented pass catcher,” On3’s Pete Nakos reported.\n\nLanding Coleman, who has a reported NIL value of $1.8 million, would be a major addition for the Longhorns, who are looking to surround quarterback Arch Manning with as much offensive firepower as possible heading into next season.\n\nHowever, Texas won’t have a clear path to securing his commitment.\n\nUnless Texas is able to close the deal during his visit, Coleman plans to take additional trips, according to ESPN’s Pete Thamel. After leaving Austin, he is expected to visit Texas A&M, Texas Tech, Alabama and USC.\n\nThose programs are all capable of competing in the NIL space, but Texas may still hold a significant advantage. The Longhorns’ 2025 roster was reportedly built with an NIL budget in the $35–40 million range. Unless that number shifts following Texas’ playoff miss this season, it will be difficult for most schools to outbid them.\n\nFor now, Coleman’s visit represents another example of how Texas continues to leverage its financial muscle in the transfer portal — and why landing elite talent in Austin often comes down to whether anyone else can realistically keep pace.",

    "fullText": "The transfer portal is open, and Texas A&M head coach Mike Elko will have plenty to consider on both sides of the ball, which will include adding another wide receiver after KC Concepcion announced his intention to enter the 2026 NFL Draft, a decision that was not surprising given his elite performance during the 2025 season.\n\nWhile Concepcion's playmaking ability will be missed, the Aggies need to find a true X receiver with the height, length, and catch radius to shore up the red zone offense, allowing starting quarterback Marcel Reed to continue improving as a pocket passer, and provide more confidence with another playmaker to utilize through the air.\n\nThis week, the news that Auburn star wide receiver Cam Coleman planned to enter the transfer portal was shocking to say the least. While the Aggies have been directly connected to the standout pass catcher, several intriguing names have entered the portal, including Texas wide receiver Parker Livingstone and Rutgers wideout Ian Strong, who both fit that X receiver mold.\n\nLivingstone's departure was surprising after finishing his redshirt freshman season with 516 yards and six receiving touchdowns. At the same time, his close friendship with starting quarterback Arch Manning helped create one of the better connections. Does this mean the Longhorns are freeing up space to pursue Cam Coleman? Possibly, but nothing has been reported.\n\nIan Strong is another solid option, standing at 6'3\", and totaled 95 receptions for 1,438 yards and 10 touchdowns during his last two seasons at Rutgers. Aggie fans will remember wide receiver Caleb Chapman, who, despite his injury issues, was one of the more reliable deep threats because of his stature and long-strider speed, which has been missing from the A&M passing attack since Noah Thomas transferred to Georgia.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M has two more intriguing transfer wide receivers to consider",

    "description": "How Joey McGuire won over Texas Tech with bold outreach and a seven-step plan to jump-start winning as the program's next head coach.",
    "fullText": "Experience isn't everything when it comes to hiring. Just look at Joey McGuire, the head football coach at Texas Tech University.\n\nWhen the Red Raiders began their head-coaching search in 2021, McGuire didn't have as stacked a résumé as his competition. As ESPN reported, he was \"a true underdog candidate.\"\n\nAt the time, McGuire had spent the majority of his coaching career at Cedar Hill High School in Texas, where he had notched three state championships. He also spent a few years as an assistant coach at Baylor.\n\nOn paper, it was the kind of background that would have given many Power 4 programs pause.\n\nTexas Tech's hiring committee may have completely overlooked McGuire had he not reached out himself. According to ESPN, he cold-called athletic director Kirby Hocutt, left a voicemail, and asked for the opportunity to interview.\n\nThat kind of bold outreach can be a differentiator.\n\n\"I always advise not to be too afraid of cold outreach,\" a former Google recruiter told Business Insider in 2023. \"If you're really interested in a company, get in touch with those you want to work with — email the CEO, the head of talent, or the hiring manager and let them know why you're the right person for the job.\"\n\nOnce McGuire got in the room, he made the most of it.\n\nESPN reported that he showed up to the interview with unmatched enthusiasm and \"a seven-step plan for winning.\" The publication said he had with him \"the full list of coaches he would like to hire. He had a detailed plan for fixing in-state recruiting and spoke of waking a sleeping giant.\"\n\nThe preparation left a lasting impression.\n\n\"We were all like, 'We found our guy,'\" Tony Hernandez, a former deputy athletic director and member of the search committee, told ESPN after the meeting.\n\nTexas Tech ultimately decided to go with McGuire, and the gamble has paid off.\n\nWhile the Red Raiders fell to Oregon in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals on Thursday, under McGuire, the team has surged from relative obscurity to a program-record 12 wins in 2025. They also secured their first outright conference championship since 1955 when they toppled BYU last month.\n\nMcGuire's story is a good reminder that a little preparation can go a long way, no matter what type of job you're applying for.\n\nAs business etiquette expert Jacqueline Whitmore told BI, \"Most people don't do the proper research about the company. We have so many resources to use, including LinkedIn, websites, and social media. There's no excuse for you to go into an interview and not know about the company and something about who might be interviewing you.\"",

    "fullText": "PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — No. 1 Indiana became the first team in the brief history of the 12-team College Football Playoff to win a game after receiving a first-round bye, smothering Alabama 38-3 in a quarterfinal at the Rose Bowl on Thursday.\n\nThe Hoosiers (14-0; No. 1 AP, No. 1 CFP) ended a six-game losing streak for teams coming off an extended layoff, including second seed Ohio State falling to Miami in the Cotton Bowl on Wednesday and fourth seed Texas Tech being shutout by Oregon in the Orange Bowl earlier on Thursday.\n\nAn inauspicious start made it seem as if Indiana might continue the trend of teams unable to respond after a long layoff, going three-and-out on the opening possession with Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza taking two sacks. The Crimson Tide (11-4; No. 11 AP, No. 9 CFP) then found early success with two quick first downs into Hoosiers’ territory before the defense stepped up to force a punt.\n\nFrom there, Indiana came to life, taking a 17-0 halftime lead on a 31-yard field goal by Nicolas Radicic and two touchdown passes from Mendoza. Avoiding an early deficit was crucial, as it had been something of a constant in the previous losses by idle teams.\n\nThe Buckeyes found themselves in a 14-0 hole at the break against the Hurricanes, and the Red Raiders allowed 104 yards to the Ducks while gaining minus-2 yards in the first quarter. In last year's Granddaddy of Them All, Oregon gave up the first 34 points in a 41-21 loss to eventual national champion Ohio State.\n\nNot spotting Alabama an early advantage allowed Indiana to continue playing to its strengths and eventually wear down the SEC at-large participant.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "title": "Notable quotes from Dan Lanning's presser after shutout vs. Texas Tech",
    "description": "Oregon Ducks head coach Dan Lanning met with media members to break down his team's win over the Texas Tech Red Raiders in the CFP Quarterfinals.",
    "fullText": "It may have taken an entire calendar year, but the Oregon Ducks finally exorcised their demons from last year with a win in the College Football Playoff Quarterfinals. They manhandled the Texas Tech Red Raiders in a 23-0 shutout, where the Big-12 champions’ top-10 offense was dismantled.\n\nDan Lanning was visibly frustrated with his team’s defense after their win in the first round of the playoffs, so it makes sense why the unit put together such an inspired performance. The same couldn’t be said for the offense, who only had 16 points total before a garbage-time touchdown inflated the stats slightly.\n\nWhile there are still things to improve upon, it should make the Ducks feel good that they can be so dominant while playing far below their potential. They are just two wins away from being immortalized as champions. Let’s look at what Lanning had to say about that prospect and the win today over Texas Tech.\n\nLanning: Unbelievable game. A lot of fun. We've talked to our guys about being battle tested all year and having to win in different ways. That game went back and forth in a lot of ways, struggled at times to go score points, and our defense did an unbelievable job getting the ball back. And then our offense showed up when it mattered most at the end of the game. I think we out-physicaled our opponent at the end. A lot of respect for Coach McGuire and the team that he's had. This shouldn't discredit them. I remember this feeling last year when you have a really good team, you play really good football all year, and then it comes to an end. And that's the way it is for every team but one. Certainly grateful for our fans and excited to see them show up in Atlanta.\n\nQ: What did you make of the hype surrounding Texas Tech’s defense before this game?\n\nLanning: Yeah, we thought they were. They are a good defense. Their performance today, I think it showed it. You walk into halftime, it's 6-0, that's a great indicator of them being a good defense. And they had some guys that played some really good ball. We just felt like in this moment it was going to be about chipping away and eventually it was going to break. It kind of broke open with us creating some extra opportunities there with takeaways, opportunities on special teams. I thought our special teams played really, really well.\n\nBut we had a lot of respect for Texas Tech's defense. They don't play the way they've played all year and not be good. And they are. They're good. We thought it would be about explosive plays. There weren't a ton of explosive plays in this game really for either side. But the physicality showed up for our guys down the stretch.\n\nQ: How were you able to shut down the Red Raiders’ passing attack?\n\nLanning: Definitely it starts with players like Brandon. I think Brandon would tell you the same thing. It's about 11 guys executing, and that's how you get an opportunity to create plays like that. I think when we pull up this film and we watch it, we're going to see 11 guys playing the same call. We knew their tempo would be an issue. So ultimately we wanted to be able to get the call in fast and let our guys line up. I thought we did a really good job of that.\n\nI thought Coach Lupoi did a great job of calling the game, and our defensive coaches preparing them. I felt like it was probably faster in practice than it was in the game, which is ultimately what we wanted. And then we knew their strengths. They've been really good at completing shots down the field. They've had a really good screen game. Those are things that we really prepared for and worked really hard for, and guys like Brandon showed up.\n\nQ: Can you speak about your mindset on going for it in fourth down?\n\nLanning: Well, it worked sometimes and didn't work sometimes. So I assume all the times it didn't work I'm stupid and all the times it worked I'm smart. That's kind of how it works. I feel like -- we talked about it at halftime. We made some adjustments. They were playing really good 4th down defense, and we decided, hey, let's take the points in the second half. But I think that's our mindset. We make those decisions early in the week, and I certainly trust our offense. They ran a really tough defensive call for what we called down there in the red area. That's one that you wish you had back, say we could have took the points there. But points are never guaranteed. We missed a field goal, too.\n\nBut I felt good about -- we had an early look on punt and felt like we were going to have a look at the punt fake. That was an opportunity to go be aggressive. And just felt like ultimately, if you limit the opportunities for their offense to be on the field, you were going to increase the opportunities for us to go score and them not to, and that showed up today.\n\nQ: What is the challenges of defending a player like David Bailey?\n\nLanning: They've got good players, man. They've got really good players. They've got a great front. Ultimately they rushed the passer really, really well. I'm excited to evaluate the film and say how can we shore that up. I think there's going to be some small things that we can attack and make better. There's some plays we were really efficient at today, and then there were some plays that weren't. When you have a player like David Bailey, when you have players that you're going to see in the College Football Playoff, you've got to have a plan for them. At times our plan was really good, and then there was some times that we could certainly improve that.\n\nQ: Can you speak about Brandon Finney Jr.’s interception in the end zone?\n\nLanning: It's a strategic play. He did it exactly like we asked him to do. We tell him to play low to high down in the red area. He did exactly that. He played low until the player was able to show up and take away the low and then he creeped to high, and he made an outstanding play. I was just as impressed with the fact took a knee after he caught it.\n\nQ: What are your thoughts on not having a first-round bye?\n\nLanning: I guess it works, right? I've been a proponent for games to be happening much quicker for a long time. I think that's best for college football. Again, I felt like this game -- the Orange Bowl, first off, was unbelievable. I should have really given kudos to the Orange Bowl because it's been a great experience, but it's not the same bowl experience anymore when you talk about playoffs. Our guys didn't leave the hotel. They had a mindset that we can celebrate when this thing is all over with and they were really focused, but the hospitality here was unbelievable.\n\nBut we're trying to serve two different purposes here, and this is a playoff. A playoff in my opinion should have been played in Lubbock, Texas. I've said that before. That's not because we wanted to go play in Lubbock; I certainly didn't. I'm glad we played here in Miami, and it was good prep for us, but last year very similar situation for us. I feel like that game should have been played in Eugene. There's a lot of people that do playoffs. I feel like the playoffs have looked a certain way for a long time, and we're trying to serve two purposes here. The amount of time in between games, obviously, is tough for teams. We experienced it last year.\n\nQ: What will the next 24 hours look like for your team after this win?\n\nLanning: Well, it's going to start with about a five-hour flight, five-and-a-half-hour flight, but we'll be watching film on the way back, start trying to evaluate the opponents that we could potentially play. Hopefully we get some wi-fi up there in the air and we can flip on a game and check it out. But it always starts with us. That's where we're going to go back and look at this game and say, okay, what did we do really well. Let's go to the doctor, let's figure out what kind of medicine we've got to take for the next game because I think that's always the greatest indicator of what you have to improve, when you start to analyze what you have in front of you. Then we'll have kind of a bonus day here tomorrow and then we'll hop right into a normal week prep, Sunday prep. I don't even know what day today is. Today is Saturday in my mind. But we'll get a bonus day, and then it'll be Sunday the next day.\n\nContact/Follow @Ducks_Wire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oregon Ducks news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ducks Wire: Top quotes from Dan Lanning after CFP win vs. Texas Tech Red Raiders",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOregon vs. Texas Tech highlights\n\nWhere to watch Oregon vs. Texas Tech\n\nCollege Football Playoff schedule\n\nThis year's College Football Playoff Orange Bowl game should be a great one, between the No. 5 Oregon Ducks and the No. 4 Texas Tech Red Raiders.\n\nTexas Tech earned the first-round bye after finishing 12-1 on the season as Big 12 champions. Oregon, meanwhile, took care of James Madison 51-34 at home in the first round.\n\nBoth of these teams have high-powered offenses. Oregon quarterback Dante Moore has the Ducks humming, averaging 39.2 points per game, good for ninth nationally. Tech's offense is equally explosive and has the nation's No. 2 scoring offense, led by signal-caller Behren Morton.\n\nThis game could come down to whichever defense gets off the field quicker. Both teams are also quite solid. Texas Tech allows just 254.4 yards per game, ranking third nationally in total defense. Oregon, meanwhile, gives up 271.4 per game. Another big factor to keep an eye on this one is turnovers. Texas Tech's defense has forced 31 turnovers this year, which leads the FBS. In Oregon's lone 30-20 loss to Indiana earlier this season, the Ducks had two turnovers.\n\nOregon is looking to prove it's a legitimate playoff contender, despite getting embarrassed in last year's quarterfinal round against Ohio State. Texas Tech, meanwhile, is on the CFP for the first time in school history, and looking to show it's right where it's supposed to be.\n\nWe should be in for a great one in Miami, Fla.

    "description": "Our free college football picks expect Texas State to flaunt their class vs. Rice in the Armed Forces Bowl. Free Rice vs. Texas State predictions for January 2, 2026.",
    "fullText": "The last day of bowl season kicks off on Tuesday morning in Fort Worth, TX, as the Rice Owls face the Texas State Bobcats in the Armed Forces Bowl at Amon G. Carter Stadium.\n\nRice is one of three 5-7 teams featuring in a bowl game, and my Rice vs. Texas State predictions believe the Owls are up against it, facing a quality Texas State team that is better than its 6-6 record indicates.\n\nRead on for my college football picks for Friday, January 2.\n\nTexas State will win this game and move to 7-6. The Bobcats suffered many close and heartbreaking defeats this season, but they’re still a solid team headed in the right direction under G.J. Kinne. This isn’t the kind of squad that has any business flirting with a losing record, whereas Rice is guaranteed to finish below .500.\n\nThe Rice Owls arrive in bowl season thanks to their APR Score and not anything that they’ve done on the football field. They clawed their way to five wins, but Scott Abell’s squad still has a lot of work to do before it can be considered a quality football team.\n\nThe Texas State Bobcats, on the other hand, have much more impressive metrics than you’d expect from a 6-6 team playing in the Group of 5.\n\nThe offense ranks Top 10 in EPA per play, led by star quarterback Brad Jackson (3,742 total yards, 34 TDs), workhorse running back Lincoln Pare (1,328 scrimmage yards, 13 TDs), and star receivers Beau Sparks and Chris Dawn Jr. (combined 2,044 yards, 11 TDs) behind a quality offensive line.\n\nThat potent unit will be close to full strength for this bowl game with no announced opt-outs as of December 31. They should exploit a beatable Rice defense that allowed more explosive plays than any other team in the country and checks in at 118th in EPA per play.\n\nOn the flip side, Rice will be without starting quarterback Chase Jenkins, and perhaps two of its top skill position players (wideout Drayden Dickmann and running back Daelen Alexander).\n\nThis unit was already bad (114th in success rate) and wants to keep the ball on the ground (fourth in rush rate), which might prove difficult against a Texas State defense ranking 55th in rush defense grade per PFF.\n\nThis is one of the highest totals we’ve seen in a Rice game all season, so my natural inclination is to bite the bullet and play the Under. The Owls play at a very slow pace (118th in snaps per minute) and simply aren’t built to play from behind or get into a shootout, which the game script calls for.\n\nThe defense will give up plenty, but that probably happens early in the ball game. Kinne will simply want to get his team out of Fort Worth with a victory, and can likely do so by a sizable margin even if he has his team cool the jets in the second half.\n\nSpread: Rice +14.5 | Texas State -14.5\n\nMoneyline: Rice +560 | Texas State -800\n\nOver/Under: Over 56.5 | Under 56.5\n\nRice is 2-5 ATS in its last seven games.

    "fullText": "EL PASO, Texas (KTSM) — An act of kindness took an unfortunate turn when an alleged homeless man was seen getting arrested earlier this week as he became aggressive at the entrance of a barber shop in El Paso’s Upper Valley, just moments after he was given money, a free haircut, snacks, and water.\n\nA video posted online by a local barber went viral, showing how he arrives at the barber shop, where a man is already sitting at the entrance. The barber greets the man and hands him money before asking if he wants some potato chips or water, to which the man says yes.\n\nOnce inside the shop, the barber can be seen grabbing at least three bags of potato chips and giving them to the man. They exchange a few words, and the barber offers the man a haircut, and he agrees. The video then shows the barber giving the man a haircut, and once he’s done, he’s seen walking the man to the door, saying, “Alright, man. Take care of yourself. I love you, brother. God bless you.”\n\nThe video cuts, and the barber is now seen inside the shop with the doors locked as the man is outside knocking on the door aggressively and shouting. The barber can be heard telling the man that he just gave him a haircut and that he is ungrateful.\n\nMoments later, El Paso police officers arrive outside the business where they are recorded confronting the man outside the shop. The incident escalates, and two officers are seen pinning the man down, and one of them appears to have shocked the man with a stun gun.\n\nKTSM 9 News reached out to the El Paso Police Department \n\nThe barber, who did not want to be identified by name and goes by z_cutzzz on social media, has previously shared similar acts of kindness online. His accounts feature barber content, lifestyle posts, and recurring messages encouraging people to be kind to one another.\n\nWhen KTSM 9 News asked “z_cutzzz” how he felt about the way the incident turned out, he said, “I can’t control the outcome of every situation but just keep my head up and know that it’s all for the glory of God so I can’t lose.”",

The gun was found nearby, he added.\n\nOlmos was last seen on the morning of Dec. 24 leaving her home in northwest Bexar County. Olmos’ mother told NBC News that her daughter typically went for morning walks but didn’t return on Dec. 24.\n\nIf you or someone you know is in crisis, call or text 988 or go to 988lifeline.org to reach the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.

    "fullText": "The Oregon Ducks have been waiting for this moment for exactly one year.\n\nThe last time the calendar switched over to a new year, the Ducks went to the Rose Bowl, where Ohio State swiftly bounced them out of the College Football Playoff. Although the opponent and site are different, Dan Lanning's crew is looking for some redemption.\n\nThis time, it will be Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl for Oregon in the quarterfinals of this postseason. Should they win, the Ducks will go on to the Peach Bowl in Atlanta to face either Alabama and their old nemesis Kalen DeBoer or Indiana, the team that handed Oregon its only loss this year.\n\nThe Red Raiders aren't a pushover, however, and the Ducks will have to play well in order to move on. Texas Tech is 12-1 and is the Big XII champion. They have a formidable offense and defense. All 12 of their victories have been over a 20-point margin. Playing in a close game or from behind isn't their forte. The Ducks are hoping to do just that and are counting on their past success in the Big Ten to carry them through on New Year's Day.\n\nIt's been almost two weeks since Oregon defeated James Madison 51-34 and are even more healthy going into this game with Texas Tech. But receiver Evan Stewart, who has been out all year and speculated to be available for this game, has been listed as out. Other than that, the Duck offense should be running on full cylinders against a very good Red Raider defense.\n\nOregon vs. Texas Tech will be broadcast nationally on ESPN in the Orange Bowl and the quarterfinals of the College Football Playoff, with the winner moving on to play either Alabama or Indiana in the Peach Bowl in Atlanta Jan. 9. The game will feature play-by-play announcer Joe Tessitore and analyst Jesse Palmer, along with sideline reporters Katie George and Stormy Buonantony. Fans can stream on ESPN+.\n\nLocation: Hard Rock Stadium, Miami Gardens, FL.\n\nThe Oregon Ducks vs. Texas Tech Red Raiders game starts at 9:00 a.m. PST on Jan. 1, 2026, in Miami Gardens, FL.\n\nOdds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook as of Wednesday, Dec. 31\n\nMoneyline: Oregon -134, Texas Tech +114\n\nContact/Follow @Ducks_Wire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oregon Ducks news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ducks Wire: How to watch Oregon vs Texas Tech, streaming and betting info",

    "fullText": "Ahead of this Saturday's Under Armour All-American Game, which will feature more than half of the Aggies' 2027 recruiting class commits, the check-in portion, which took place on Tuesday afternoon, provided recruiting insiders plenty of insight regarding several elite recruits who have yet to commit to a program and are being connected to Texas A&M.\n\nProspects are taking notice after watching former Bowling Green edge Cashius Howell become an unanimous All-American during his final season with the Aggies, proving that head coach Mike Elko and his defensive staff, now including new co-defensive coordinator and defensive line coach Elijah Robinson, are on the right track.\n\nFor the No. 8-ranked prospect in the 2027 cycle, five-star edge Zyron Forstall, who will play in Saturday's game, revealed to Rivals insider Steve Wiltfong that the Aggies are \"probably sitting at the top right now\" of his recruitment list, which further proves that Robinson's hire, paired with Cashius Howell's acendance, has made the Aggies a top destination.\n\nForstall visited Texas A&M back on October 4. While the Aggies failed to take advantage of playing in Kyle Field during the first round of the College Football Playoff, falling 10-3 to Miami, Mike Elko's defense will continue to improve with better talent.\n\n“Really just the communication and how they showed interest and how consistent they’ve been reaching out and trying to get me out as much as possible.”\n\n“Really I’d say going back to watching their defense play this year and them telling me a position I can play. They have a guy on the field showing this is what you’re going to do and we’re going to develop you.”\n\nElko and his staff reportedly see Forstall as a Cashius Howell clone, which is quite the compliment, and given his five-star status, Forstall is ahead of schedule.\n\nAccording to Rivals, Forstall is currently positioned as the 9th-ranked prospect in the 2027 class, the No. 1-ranked Edge, and the 2nd-ranked prospect in Florida.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M is 'sitting at the top' of 2027 5-star Zyron Forstall's list",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines are in a transition period regarding their football program. A 41-27 loss in the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl against the Texas Longhorns in Orlando marked the end of an era.\n\nMore specifically, the end of the Biff Poggi era. But, Poggi didn't want reporters to forget Wednesday what he meant to the program.\n\n“This isn’t a rebuild at all,” Poggi said of Michigan. \"That would shortchange the kids, and coach [Kyle] Whittingham is going to do an amazing job.”\n\nDespite Poggi's optimism about the program, he said he won't be part of it moving forward.\n\n\"What was my message to the team?\" Poggi said alongside linebacker Jimmy Rolder.\n\n\"Well, it is my last game at Michigan, and my message to the team after the game, what was my message to the team after the game? Do you remember?\"\n\nRolder, only a freshman, responded with a smile.\n\n\"Coach Biff has done so much for us, not even in just the football space, but just overall life advice,\" Rolder said. \"Everyone on the team looks up to him. Respects him so much. It sucks we weren’t able to go out there and win for him, because that is what everyone wanted to do. He was just telling us he was proud of us, thankful for the opportunity, and yeah.\"\n\nPoggi said Whittingham should be allowed and will center his focus on football with all the fallout from the Sherrone Moore situation in the past.\n\n\"Again, he is a guy that has won 180 games,\" Poggi said. \"He has been a head coach 20 years. He has won three conference championships, one in the WAC and two in the Big 12. I think he is going to find it very, very full covered, a bunch of very willing kids that are just great kids. People talk about Michigan and what it means to be a Michigan Man. I have a son that is a Michigan Man. I am not a Michigan Man. I didn’t go there, but these kids here are the definition of that, and I think he is going to love that.\"\n\nUltimately, Poggi wants his lasting image to be that he was grateful to lead the Wolverines for a short period.\n\n\"I have been a head coach in over 300 football games at all levels,\" Poggi said. \"There is not a team I have ever been prouder of than this team. I mean, these guys are unbelievable, and they are great human beings. At Michigan, you have to be a great student. There are very high standards on how to conduct themselves. It is truly the full package.\"\n\nNow that the season has ended, the Whittingham era has begun.",

    "title": "4 takeaways from Michigan’s Citrus Bowl loss vs Texas",
    "description": "A putrid defensive effort. A game featuring costly turnovers from Bryce Underwood. Here are takeaways from Michigan’s loss to Texas.",
    "fullText": "The Michigan Wolverines lost to Texas 41-27 in the Citrus Bowl, finishing the season 9-4.\n\nHere are key takeaways from Michigan’s loss to Texas.\n\nHeading into the fourth quarter, Michigan quarterback Bryce Underwood was 15-of-28 for 126 yards with two passing touchdowns. However, the wheels came off in the fourth quarter, and Underwood had two brutal interceptions thrown right to Texas defenders. Michigan was trailing just 24-20 heading into the final frame, but Underwood’s interceptions were extremely costly and careless. Underwood finished the day 23-of-42 for 199 yards with two touchdowns, three interceptions, along with 77 rushing yards and a score. Underwood’s just 18 and ups and downs during a true freshman campaign are to be expected. What’s troubling is how bad the interceptions were and how he played against the toughest teams on Michigan’s schedule.\n\nThe hope will be that Underwood has a better sophomore campaign with Kyle Whittingham as head coach, as Sherrone Moore didn’t exactly set him up for success this year. Even so, his interceptions in the Citrus Bowl were on him and must get cleaned up moving forward, otherwise Michigan will not be beating Ohio State or making a legitimate run at the College Football Playoff. Granted, Underwood’s ceiling is high, and he made many wow plays throughout 2025, but question marks still remain, and it’s not a sure thing that he develops into a superstar. At the very least, his showing in the Citrus Bowl was a discouraging effort heading into the offseason.\n\nMichigan defensive coordinator Wink Martindale almost certainly coached his last game at Michigan, and it couldn’t have gone much worse. Michigan had numerous missed tackles, they didn’t generate a sack despite blitzing a lot, they had blown coverages, and they allowed Arch Manning to gash them with his arm and legs. Manning was 21-of-34 for 221 yards with two touchdowns. Manning also embarrassed the Michigan defense as a runner with 155 yards, two touchdowns, including a 60-yard score to put Texas up 38-27. Michigan’s defense was bad against USC, Ohio State, and Texas, and a change in scheme and leadership is desperately needed on that side of the ball.\n\nWhile Michigan players didn’t execute at a high clip in the Citrus Bowl and the coaches didn’t call a good enough game to get a W, it’s Sherrone Moore’s fault that the game was so messy to begin with. Most criticism should be directed at Moore, not interim head coach Biff Poggi, the staff, or the players.\n\nThe 2025 season is now over and will be one that marks the end of an era and the beginning of a new one with head coach Kyle Whittingham. With Whittingham in charge, there’s actually light at the end of the tunnel; there’s hope that this program can get back on track. Even before details of Moore’s scandal emerged, it was becoming increasingly clear that Moore and his staff weren’t of the caliber that competes for championships. With Whittingham, the hope of a College Football Playoff berth feels a lot more attainable.\n\nWhile Michigan’s loss to Texas was an ugly way to finish the year, the good news is the season is finally over, and the program can move forward in a more cohesive and successful direction.\n\nI do takeaways every week and have for the better part of the last decade on Maize n Brew. I’ve covered many wins, and some seasons that have been absolute duds (2017 stunk, 2020 hurt my soul, and the past two years have had painful moments as well), yet you, the Maize n Brew readers, are always here to interact with me and read these takeaways whether Michigan wins or loses. I say this on behalf of myself and the entire Maize n Brew staff — thank you, thank you, thank you! You are part of our lives, and you’re stuck with us a while longer, talking about this silly sport we love. Happy New Year! Talk to you in 2026.",

    "description": "The Citrus Bowl is here, and for the last time in 2025, Michigan Football is set to take the field. Here are 3 keys to victory for the Wolverines vs Texas:",
    "fullText": "Bowl season is here, and after a tumultuous month of December, the No. 18 Michigan Wolverines — with an interim head coach in place — are set to take on the No. 13 Texas Longhorns in the Citrus Bowl today in Orlando.\n\nBoth teams had hopes of making the College Football Playoff this season, but failed to get in after 9-3 regular seasons. As most of these non-CFP bowl games go, several players are opting out on both sides; Texas won’t have key players on both sides of the ball, and the Wolverines will be without guys like Derrick Moore, Jaishawn Barham and Giovanni El-Hadi.\n\nHere are the final three keys to victory for the 2025 season for the Wolverines.\n\nWhen Michigan’s offense is on the field against Texas’ defense, both teams will be led by interim coordinators. For the Wolverines, co-offensive coordinator and tight ends coach Steve Casula will be calling plays with Chip Lindsey off to Missouri, and inside linebackers coach and co-defensive coordinator Johnny Nansen will be calling plays defensively after Texas fired defensive coordinator Pete Kwiatkowski earlier this month.\n\nWhile many key defensive starters are out for the Longhorns, All-American linebacker Colin Simmons, a projected first-round pick with 11 sacks, will be playing. Simmons can wreck an entire game plan, so Michigan will have to be cognizant of where he is at all times.\n\nCasula needs to include protections for Simmons in his game plan, as chipping him with tight ends Marlin Klein and others can help buy Bryce Underwood time in the pocket. Casula also needs to be aggressive against a depleted Texas defense — what exactly does he have to lose at this point? Putting together first downs by any means necessary is the priority, so I want to see him have a proper mix of run plays and pass plays.\n\nUnderwood showed flashes of his five-star talent this season, but was inconsistent overall. Needless to say, Lindsey and Moore didn’t take a lot of risks with him as a playmaker. To use a metaphor, Michigan has a Lamborghini, but it rarely took it out of the neighborhood.\n\nWith a new play caller, I want to see Underwood’s full potential in this game. Throw in a few long passes, use a few creative plays throwing to Jordan Marshall out of the backfield, let Underwood make decisions in the read-option, and maybe scheme up a few designed runs for the freshman phenom.\n\nUnderwood is a talented enough player to pull off this upset. Throw out the conservative game plan and let him lead you to the promised land.\n\nThe expectations were too high for Texas quarterback Arch Manning to start this season, and he struggled early in the season. But he really came into his own to close out the year.\n\nYahoo NFL analyst Nate Tice said Manning would be the No. 1 pick in the draft if he declared. Breaking down his season through the NFL lens, CBS Sports’ Mike Renner gave him a C+ when it came to decision-making. Here’s what Renner wrote:\n\n“There are still numerous issues with his decision-making evaluators will want to see cleaned up. The two biggest are turning down easy completions and pre-determining two- or three-man concepts.\n\n‘The first is not uncommon with mobile quarterbacks who like to hunt big plays, but you have to take profits when you can in the NFL. The second is probably the more worrisome. What makes it all the more head-scratching is that he’s awesome going 1-to-2-to-3 on full-field reads. Give him a binary choice on one side, and he’d too often miss a receiver streaking wide open.”\n\nManning struggled with interceptions earlier this fall, but he didn’t throw a pick in Texas’ last two games (wins against Arkansas and Texas A&M). Michigan is going to need Manning to turn over the ball once or twice to win this one, so I’d expect Wink Martindale to dial up some NFL blitzes to force Manning to make quick decisions. If he hunts the big plays that Renner referred to, Michigan may be able to swing momentum with a pick or two.\n\nWhat else does Michigan need to do to win this game? Let us know in the comments.",

    "fullText": "A body has been found amid a search for a Texas teenager who went missing on Christmas Eve, authorities said Tuesday.\n\nCamila Mendoza Olmos, 19, was last seen Wednesday morning, according to the Bexar County Sheriff's Office. Sheriff's deputies and volunteers have been searching around the clock for her since and there was information to suggest she was in \"imminent danger,\" according to Sheriff Javier Salazar.\n\nWhile searching an area Tuesday afternoon, authorities found a body in a field approximately 100 yards from Mendoza Olmos' home, in northwest Bexar County, Salazar said.\n\n\"At this point we don't suspect foul play,\" he said during a press briefing.\n\nThe body has not yet been officially identified and a cause and manner of death have not yet been determined by the local medical examiner, Salazar said.\n\n\"We hope that we can try to expedite that process to be able to get the community answers,\" he said.\n\nSalazar noted there were some indicators of self-harm.\n\nA firearm was located at the scene where the body was found, Salazar said. A firearm belonging to a relative of Mendoza Olmos' has been missing, he said. Authorities have not yet determined if the missing firearm is a match for the one observed at the scene, he said.\n\nNew video may show Texas teenage girl who's been missing since Christmas Eve: Sheriff\n\nSalazar said one possibility investigators were working under regarding the teen's disappearance was the \"fear of self-harm,\" and that there were some \"indicators of suicidal ideation\" and undiagnosed signs of depression.\n\n\"From what's being described to us, it sounds like it was a young person going through a very tough time in their life,\" he said.\n\nThe body was found shortly before 5 p.m. local time on Tuesday, Salazar said. The area had been previously searched, though authorities with the sheriff's office and FBI were back on Tuesday, Salazar said. The field has tall grass, and authorities felt there would be a benefit to check it again, he said.\n\n3 found dead during search for fallen hiker in California, authorities say\n\nThe body was found in clothing similar to a description of what Mendoza Olmos may have been wearing when she went missing, Salazar said.\n\n\"This is certainly not the outcome we were hoping for,\" he said.\n\nAmid the search for the teen, authorities this week released a dashcam video from someone who was driving to work on Wednesday morning and passed a woman walking by herself. Salazar said Tuesday it is still unclear if that person was Mendoza Olmos.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with thoughts of suicide - free, confidential help is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

    "fullText": "Jacob Rodriguez position change: How Texas Tech star went from QB recruit to All-American linebacker originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Texas Tech Red Raiders are making their first-ever College Football Playoff debut, set to take on the Oregon Ducks in the Orange Bowl quarterfinal matchup.\n\nA big reason for Tech's success this season is how well linebacker Jacob Rodriguez has been playing. He leads the Red Raiders in tackles with 117 total stops on the year, and has helped lead Texas Tech into an elite defense this season.\n\nBut what you may not know about the veteran linebacker is that he actually only started playing defense once he got to Texas Tech in 2022, previously starting his career at Virginia as an offensive player.\n\nLet's take a look at how Rodriguez transformed his college career, moving from offense to defense.\n\nMORE:History behind Texas Tech's tortilla-throwing tradition\n\nRodriguez attended Rider High School in Wichita Falls, Texas, where he played both quarterback and free safety. Per his Texas Tech bio, he passed for 7,085 yards with 68 touchdowns, adding 3,051 yards and 38 touchdowns on the ground. His high school made two trips to the  Class 5A Division II state semifinals during his sophomore and senior seasons.\n\nPer his 247Sports recruiting page, Rodrigues also played basketball and participated in the long jump, triple jump and relays for his track and field team.\n\nMORE:Revisiting Patrick Mahomes' Texas Tech career\n\nGiven his multi-position background in high school, he was listed as an athlete by 247Sports. The outlet listed him as a 3-star, ranked as the No. 26 athlete from the class of 2021.\n\nHe received offers from a number of power-conference schools, such as Baylor, Houston, Indiana, Kansas State, Iowa State and Virginia. He committed to the Cavaliers' 2021 class in April 2020 and remained committed up through his Dec. signing. Despite other schools wanting him to play defense, UVA actually recruited Rodriguez as a quarterback.\n\n“That had a little effect on my decision,” Rodriguez said in April 2020 via the Times Record News. “Beyond playing football, I want to go into coaching. I feel like learning the quarterback position at the college level gives me a better understanding of play calls and how to learn how to do things as a whole on offense.\"\n\nBut once he got to Virginia, he was utilized at a number of positions on offense, including receiver and fullback. He appeared in all 12 games as a true freshman, getting eight receptions for 65 yards and a touchdown with another 10 carries for 56 yards on the ground.\n\nHe played behind UVA quarterback Brennan Armstrong, who broke single-season records for the Cavaliers in 2021.\n\nPer a recent ESPN feature on Rodriguez, UVA coaches told him they planned to make him into the next Taysom Hill. But his time in Charlottesville lasted just one season, as he entered the transfer portal in Dec. 2021 after UVA head coach Bronco Mendenhall abruptly resigned after six seasons as the Cavs head coach.\n\nMORE:Picks, predictions  for 2025 CFP quarterfinal games\n\nRodriguez entered the portal largely because of Mendenhall leaving.\n\n\"I loved it there and loved the people there,\" Rodriguez said via ESPN of his time at Virginia. \"But I kind of went there to play for him.\"\n\nTexas Tech head coach Joey McGuire, who had recruited Rodriguez in high school while he was at Baylor, offered Rodriguez a spot on the team as a walk-on, but was placed on scholarship before the 2022 season.\n\nPrior to him transferring to Texas Tech, the Red Raiders coaches informed him he would not be joining as a quarterback. Although it took some time, Rodriguez started figuring out the defensive side of things in 2022.\n\n\"Really just knowing that I can make an impact whatever position I play,\" Rodriguez said via NWA Online of the position change. \"I've done it on the offensive side of the ball, I've done it on the defensive side of a ball, and I've done it on special teams. I can really play with anybody,\" he said. \"That's kind of when I figured I can do this. I saw myself progressing a lot on the defensive side of the ball, and week to week just getting better and better.\"\n\nLOOK:Texas Tech's 'Too-Cold' uniforms\n\nRodriguez finished with a combined 59 total tackles during his first two seasons at linebacker. But you can see the huge numbers he's put up during his junior and senior seasons:\n\nUnsurprisingly, Rodriguez cleaned up during the college football awards season. Here's a look at each award he took home:\n\nChuck Bednarik Award (nation's top defensive player)\n\nButkus Award (nation's top linebacker)\n\nBronko Nagurski Trophy (nation's top defensive player)\n\nLombardi Award (nation's top lineman or linebacker)\n\nPony Express Award (nation's top duo with David Bailey)\n\nDespite a campaign for him to be a Heisman finalist, was not invited to New York City. Even still, the linebacker impressively finished fifth in Heisman voting, receiving 17 first-place votes.\n\nMORE:Why Michigan landed the perfect replacement for Sherrone Moore in Kyle Whittingham",

    "description": "Texas Christian running back Jeremy Payne scores on a 35-yard catch-and-run in overtime, sending No. 16 USC to a shocking, 30-27 loss in the Alamo Bowl.",
    "fullText": "For a nine-win team like USC, once again on the outside looking in at the College Football Playoff, the bowl season can feel a bit like purgatory. One foot in the past season, the other in the future, your team trapped somewhere in between.\n\nThere were glimpses of each Tuesday night for USC, in a brutal 30-27 Alamo Bowl overtime defeat at the hands of Texas Christian. Equal reminders both of what could have been this season, had USC ever played at its best for long, and also flashes of why it never managed to come together.\n\nIn one moment, there was true freshman Tanook Hines, sprinting to catch a deep ball in stride, announcing himself as a rising star. In another, a TCU running back was busting his way through tackles on third-and-long, rumbling his way into the end zone, deflating any delusions of grandeur.\n\nBut the final minutes took the Trojans on a tour of all the most glaring concerns from their 2025 season, from the leaky defense to the missed opportunities on offense. USC had led by two scores with less than five minutes remaining, only to see its lead evaporate in that span.\n\nIt got all the way to the five-yard line in overtime, but failed to punch in, settling for a field goal that would spell its demise.\n\nThough, it didn’t seem to be headed that way as TCU faced a third and 20, with its hopes hanging in the balance. Quarterback Ken Seals simply dumped it off to his running back, Jeremy Payne, and hoped for the best.\n\nHe got it, all while dealing the Trojans a nightmarish conclusion in the process.\n\nPayne broke one tackle, then another, then another, rumbling his way 35 yards until he’d scored a walk-off touchdown, leaving USC with a 9-4 record and bitter taste in its mouth heading into the offseason.\n\nThere had been multiple chances throughout for USC to put the game away, just like there had been multiple chances in each of the Trojans’ four losses this season.\n\nAnd now, USC faces a litany of questions unanswered, not the least of which being what direction will USC take its defense, after coordinator D’Anton Lynn departed for Penn State just before the game.\n\nUSC certainly played like it had lost its coordinator and half of its starters on that side of the ball, giving up 144 yards in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe questions raised Tuesday, however, did not include how USC might replace its No. 1 wideout next season. Hines had already done his part to earn that role, but declared it to the world with a six-catch, 163-yard performance.\n\nKing Miller offered similar confidence in the future of USC’s rushing attack, running for 99 yards and a touchdown.\n\nBut they may have been the only two. Jayden Maiava, who will return next season, completed 18 of 30 passes for 280 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions.\n\nUSC was already facing an uphill climb with its roster, considering over a dozen starters or would-be starters were out for one reason or another. Three of the Trojans’ starting offensive linemen didn’t dress. Both of their top receivers and top tight end were in street clothes, having already declared for the NFL draft. Twenty-five players listed in USC’s two-deep were either freshmen or redshirt freshmen.\n\nThen there was the matter of being without their defensive coordinator. Lynn left the team a day after he officially took the same job at Penn State. The decision for Lynn not to coach the bowl was described to The Times as “a mutual agreement”. But his absence left USC to entrust defensive line coach Eric Henderson to step into a role he wasn’t expecting.\n\nIt went quite smoothly at first. USC held TCU to two straight three-and-outs — and just 11 total yards in two drives — to open the game.\n\nBut on the ensuing possession, Maiava threw into heavy coverage in the seam. His pass was picked off. The momentum USC had built up dissolved almost instantly.\n\nThe defense’s strong start faded into disarray. TCU turned up the tempo and mounted consecutive touchdown drives. Mistakes piled up for a defense that was relying on inexperienced players at every level. Tackling, which was improved all season, suddenly was a struggle.\n\nTwice, USC stalled after promising drives, deep in TCU territory, leaving it to settle for a pair of first-half field goals and take a 14-13 deficit into halftime.\n\nUSC came out of the locker room looking ready to kick into gear. Linebacker Jadyn Walker tipped a pass deep in TCU territory, and safety Christian Pierce came down with the interception, putting USC in perfect position to capitalize.\n\nUSC handed it right back. With the ball at the seven-yard line, Maiava threw into traffic once again. It was picked off in the end zone.\n\nBut this time, USC’s defense managed to salvage the mistake, forcing a three-and-out, only to find itself on the field again less than 90 seconds later. It got another stop, nonetheless.\n\nMaiava finally made the most of that opportunity. He hit Hines in stride on a 46-yard bomb, then found senior Jaden Richardson in the corner of the end zone for a stunning, one-handed score.\n\nBut TCU refused to go away. The Horned Frogs mounted two scoring drives in the final five minutes, forcing overtime.\n\n In your inbox every Monday morning.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "ARLINGTON, Texas — The Cotton Bowl certainly has gotten much more significant for Ohio State during three trips in a row to the game.\n\nThis time, the second-seeded Buckeyes (12-1) are defending national champions as they get ready to play College Football Playoff first-timer Miami (11-2, CFP No. 10 seed) in a quarterfinal here Wednesday night. The Cotton Bowl last January was a CFP semifinal when Ohio State beat Texas for the third of four wins needed last postseason for a sixth Associated Press national title.\n\nAs for the first of those appearances in North Texas two years ago, that was the last season before the CFP expanded from four to 12 teams and when it wasn’t the Cotton Bowl’s turn as one of the playoff games. The Buckeyes arrived then coming off a regular season-ending loss to rival Michigan after a 10-0 start. Their starting quarterback (Kyle McCord) had transferred and NFL-bound All-American receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. opted out of playing in what was a 14-3 loss to Missouri.\n\n“Just more stakes than the first game I’ve ever played in here. ... Now it’s a bowl game with the playoffs on the line, so it just means more,” senior receiver Carnell Tate said Monday on the field at AT&T Stadium.\n\n“It wasn’t CFP, so I felt like the job was not accomplished. We kind of fell short of our initial goal, and then when we played here, our quarterback ended up transferring. It was a whole lot of stuff going on,” senior cornerback Davison Igbinosun said. “It was definitely a tough game. It really didn’t feel like a typical Ohio State game, and then here last year and back in the playoffs, and that was a great game.”\n\nOhio State hasn’t played since losing 13-10 to No. 1 Indiana in the Big Ten Championship Game matchup of undefeated teams on Dec. 6, and still got a first-round bye.\n\nMiami, which is 24 years removed from its last national title, made its CFP debut with a 10-3 win in the first round at No. 7 seed Texas A&M on Dec. 20. The Hurricanes made the 12-team playoff field even after not making the ACC title game and that league’s champ (five-loss Duke) not getting a bid.\n\nWhen the Hurricanes left Dallas after a 26-20 overtime loss at SMU on Nov. 1, their second loss in three games after a 5-0 start, they weren’t even sure they would make the playoff. Now they are back in Texas for their second playoff game in a row and with another five-game winning streak.\n\n“That was a low point for us in the season, and in that locker room, it was as simple as a decision has to be made,” Miami coach Mario Cristobal said. “It came down to the simplicity of taking all the clips of us in our first five games and putting it on a reel and just letting it play. No audio, no one’s talking, no nothing. Just shut the lights, remind ourselves of who we are. And there’s nothing more powerful than the power of choice.”\n\nHeisman Trophy finalist Julian Sayin with Ohio State and Miami’s Carson Beck have both been part of national championship teams. Now the two most accurate Football Bowl Subdivision passers are trying to win a title as a starting quarterback.\n\nSayin was the Buckeyes’ backup last year behind Will Howard. Beck transferred to Miami after being at Georgia from 2020-24, when he was a youngster on the Bulldogs’ back-to-back national championship teams in 2021 and 2022 — he did get some late snaps in that second title game, a 65-7 romp over TCU.\n\nThe Cotton Bowl will be the first CFP game for Sayin, the sophomore who has thrown for 3,323 yards with 31 TDs and six interceptions. He has completed 78.4% of his passes (279 of 356). Beck made his first CFP start going 14-of-20 for 103 yards and a touchdown on a windy day in College Station. He has completed 74.5% of his passes (277 of 372) for 3,175 yards, 26 TDs and 10 interceptions.\n\nMiami’s last shot at back-to-back national championships ended in a double-overtime loss to Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 3, 2003, before most of the current players were born and the only other time these teams have met in a bowl game.\n\nOhio State, which won the first CFP national championship at AT&T Stadium at the end of the 2014 season, is now trying to win consecutive national titles for the first time. The Buckeyes are in their seventh CFP overall, and are the only team to appear in five of the last seven — all of those since Ryan Day became their head coach.\n\nThe only other time the Hurricanes played in the Cotton Bowl was at the end of the 1990 season, their last as an independent before moving to the Big East. They beat Texas 46-3 in Cotton Bowl Stadium.\n\nNO. 10 MIAMI VS. NO. 2 OHIO STATE\n\nCotton Bowl, 7:30 Wednesday, Arlington, Texas\n\nTV: ESPN Line/OU: Ohio State by 9 ½; 40 ½",

Kennedy Memorial Causeway that connects Laguna Madre and North Padre Island in Corpus Christi.\n\nBut the two never made it to Florida and were never heard from again.\n\nTwenty years later, Christian's family is still looking for him, with the help of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC).\n\nChristian’s aunt, Carla Boehm, told NCMEC she thinks her nephew could still be alive. If he is, she wants him to know that his family loves him and would love to see him again.\n\n“If he thinks nobody cares, maybe he's not even trying to come home,” Boehm told NCMEC.\n\nNow the organization is releasing a new age-progressed image created by a forensic artist to show what Christian may look like today at 35.\n\nOver the years, very little information about what happened to Christian and Andrews has surfaced.\n\nAndrews did not have permission to take the teen with him on the boat, authorities have said.\n\nOn Jan. 4, 2006, Christian's family reported him missing.\n\nThe Texas Department of Public Safety also put out a bulletin that Christian was missing, along with a picture of Andrews and the boat.\n\nWhat authorities do know is that Christian and Andrews, now 59, were in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana when the sailboat signaled for mayday, NCMEC reports.\n\nThe boat was taking in water, but the two declined any help, authorities said.\n\nBoehm remains hopeful that she and her family will be reunited with Christian.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? \n\n“I hope he's out there, and that he sees this new picture and realizes people are looking for him, and that he's wanted,” she told NCMEC.\n\nAnyone with information about Christian Hall or his disappearance is asked to contact NCMEC at 1-800-THE-LOST (1-800-843-5678) or the Corpus Christi Police Department at 1-361-886-2600.",

    "fullText": "(The Center Square) – According to an analysis of migration data from the three most populous states, more Californians and Floridians are moving to Texas than Texans are moving to those states.\n\nOverall, the majority of out-of-state movers relocating to Texas are leaving Democratic-led states that have higher state income taxes and more progressive tax policies than Texas has.\n\nAccording to an analysis of moves over a 12-month period, based on PGM’s database of 18 million moves tracked between June 2024 and May 2025, more than 1.6 million adults moved to or within Texas during this timeframe.\n\nAmong them were 265,112 from out of state, averaging 22,092 a month, or 726 a day, according to the data.\n\nThe majority moving from out of state to Texas were from California (14%), Florida (9%), and Colorado (4.5%), representing nearly one-third of new Texas residents, according to the data. Movers from Arizona (3.8%) and Illinois (3.7%) rounded out the top five, according to the data.\n\nWhen evaluating the data among the top three most populous states, more Californians and Floridians moved to Texas than the reverse, according to a breakdown of the data Hire A Helper exclusively provided to The Center Square.\n\nMore than double the number of Californians moved to Texas, 37,253, than Texans moved to California, 14,539, during the 12-month-period analyzed, according to the data.\n\nRoughly one-third more Floridians moved to Texas, 24,378, than Texans moved to Florida, 15,650, over the same time period, according to the data.\n\nAccording to a StorageCafe analysis, roughly 100,000 Californians have been moving to Texas a year – the equivalent of the population of Santa Barbara, The Center Square reported.\n\nSimilarly, roughly one-third more Californians moved to Florida, 16,457, than Floridians moved to California, 11,356, during the same 12 months, according to the data.\n\nOf the moving demographics PGM analyzed, “Gen X and millennials made up 75% of new Texans, signaling a wave of professionals and families chasing opportunity, affordability, and a higher quality of life,” Hire A Helper said.\n\nNorth Texas is the top moving destination, where business headquarters are relocating and Texas’ new stock exchange was launched, The Center Square reported.\n\nNearly 32% of those relocating moved to the Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington area during the timeframe analyzed, according to the data.\n\nThe Houston–Pasadena–The Woodlands region received the next greatest percentage of new residents, nearly 21%; the Austin–Round Rock–San Marcos region received the third greatest of 13%, according to the data.\n\nThe majority of moves in Texas over the year were in-state, 84%, “with residents shuffling between metros for better housing and jobs,” according to the analysis.\n\nSmaller cities in north Texas, including “Sherman–Denison (No. 5 for net gain), Tyler (No. 6 for net gain), and Granbury (No. 7 for net gain) are emerging as the next growth hotspots,” the report notes.\n\nTexas counties saw a massive influx of residents from July 2023 to 2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau data, The Center Square reported. Four of the top 10 counties reporting the greatest numeric growth and the greatest percentage growth in the U.S. were in Texas, according to the data.\n\nHarris County, Texas, reported the greatest population growth in 2024, followed by Miami-Dade, Florida. By contrast, California’s largest county of Los Angeles reported losses, according to the census data.\n\nOf the 10 counties reporting the greatest growth by percentage last year, four were in Texas. Two were in Florida, none were in California, according to the census data.\n\nHire A Helper data also confirms yearly census data, which shows more people are moving to southern states. When looking “at the sheer volume of people moving in minus people leaving,” states reporting the greatest number of new residents over the period analyzed were South and North Carolina, Texas, Tennessee and Florida, it said.\n\nStates where more residents left than entered are all run by Democrats: California, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Illinois, according to the data.\n\n“While California certainly had people moving in [over the year analyzed], it saw an overall net decrease in residents, -128,470,” Hire A Helper said.\n\nOne key contributing factor is state income tax, the report notes. Three of the five states people are moving to have no state income tax: Texas, Tennessee and Florida. The five states experiencing an exodus have among the highest taxes in the country.",

Kiffin managed to draw laughs with a grocery store moment. But he took a new step in winning over a rabid fanbase with an action involving Malik Nabers and the Texas Bowl.\n\nKiffin pulled into the Saturday bowl game his future team was playing in. Amid the LSU versus Houston contest, he spotted the legendary Tigers wide receiver.\n\nKiffin managed to draw new likes, retweets and comments — by snapping this photo.\n\n⁦@LSUfootball⁩ pic.twitter.com/r4iidDEQMD\n\n— Lane Kiffin (@Lane_Kiffin) December 28, 2025\n\nWhile considered a simple photo, it’s still enough for Kiffin to draw new interest among a curious group of fans. Kiffin clearly wants to have good relations with LSU — and that includes interacting with beloved Tiger players like Nabers.\n\nBefore taking on the nation’s No. 21 team, Kiffin and LSU dealt with one roster departure.\n\nLeft tackle Tyree Adams opted to enter the College Football Transfer Portal on Saturday morning. Adams rises as a pivotal early loss for the incoming head coach — with the offensive lineman surrendering zero sacks in 11 starts. He has two years of eligibility left.\n\nKiffin will need to hit the portal to find his replacement. Or he can insert incoming freshman Brysten Martinez as the blindside protector moving forward. He was a local signing for the 2026 class out of Gonzalez, La., and heads to Baton Rouge as a four-star signing.\n\nLSU, meanwhile, engaged in a close contest with the Big 12 representative as UH led 28-21 before the start of the fourth quarter.",

    "description": "The closure is expected to result in the loss of about 300 jobs in the Central Valley.",
    "fullText": "The world’s largest mozzarella cheese producer is shuttering one if its Central Valley plants, resulting in the loss of about 300 jobs.\n\nAccording to records on file with the California Employment Development Department, 268 people will be laid off at the Leprino Foods Lemoore East plant on Jan. 9 due to the facility’s permanent closure. Another 100 employees are expected to lose their jobs by Dec. 30, 2026.\n\nAttempts to reach Leprino Foods on Friday were unsuccessful.\n\nThe company announced the layoffs in November 2024, citing the Lemoore East facility’s age and equipment and high operating costs in California, according to a report in the Hanford Sentinel.\n\n“This decision is influenced by several factors, including the facility’s age, anticipated capital requirements to make improvements to the facility and add or replace equipment and systems, high operating costs in California, the long-term milk supply outlook, and the increased capacity due to the opening of our Lubbock, Texas, facility,” a Leprino spokesperson told The Sentinel.\n\nThe company is a major employer in Kings County and has two plants in Lemoore, Lemoore East and West. Lemoore West is one of the largest manufacturing facilities in the world — with more than 11 football fields worth of cheese-making capacity — while Lemoore East has been a continuous dairy operation since 1910, according to the company’s website. Leprino took over the East facility in the 1980s, SF Gate reported.\n\nThe two Leprino facilities in Lemoore process approximately 14 million pounds of milk and produce an average of 1.5 million pounds of mozzarella cheese and related products per day, according to state water board records.\n\nThe company’s Lemoore West plant isn’t expected to be impacted, according to media reports. The company also has a facility in the San Joaquin County city of Tracy.\n\nIn 2021, the company announced the opening of a new, $870 million state-of-the-art 850,000 square foot dairy manufacturing facility in Lubbock, Texas that will provide 600 jobs. Construction is expected to be completed in early 2026.\n\nFounded in 1950 and headquartered in Denver, Leprino Foods supplies cheese for food manufacturers and major pizza chains. The company employs more than 5,500 people worldwide and has U.S.-based processing plants in California, Colorado, New Mexico, Michigan, New York and Texas.\n\nAnother Valley food processing business has traded California for Texas in recent years.\n\nIn 2023, frozen food manufacturer Ruiz Foods announced it was moving its Tulare County corporate headquarters to Frisco, Texas. The company said the decision was due to the central geographic location to reach customers nationwide and the availability of talent near the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.\n\nThe company’s California operations have faced a string of employee-related legal and regulatory scrutiny over the past two decades.\n\nIn 2015, Leprino’s Lemoore plant was hit with a federal class action lawsuit alleging the company violated wage-and-hour laws. Several others followed.\n\nIn 2023, the company successfully defeated a $100 million class action lawsuit filed in 2017 after a four-week jury trial in federal court, The Business Journal reported.\n\nBut employees appealed and in 2024 won a $3.5 million class action settlement.\n\nBefore that, in 2011, Leprino Foods paid $550,000 in back wages, interest and benefits to 253 workers of Black, Latino and Asian descent who were rejected for on-call laborer positions as part of a settlement with the U.S. Labor Department.",

    "fullText": "Amidst departures to the NCAA transfer portal and opt outs for the Citrus Bowl against the Michigan Wolverines, the Texas Longhorns received some positive news for the 2026 season on Friday when junior safety Jelani McDonald announced his return for his senior campaign.\n\nAt 6’2 and 199 pounds, McDonald has prototypical size and explosiveness for the position that could allow him to become one of the first safeties taken in the 2027 NFL Draft if he stays healthy and maintains his developmental trajectory.\n\nOut of Waco Connally, McDonald was a late riser in the 2023 recruiting class, receiving his offer from the Longhorns in October when he was committed to Oklahoma State. TCU also factored into McDonald’s recruitment, hosting him for an official and unofficial visit late in the process, but it was McDonald’s time on the Forty Acres in December that ultimately sealed his decision to spurn his father’s alma mater and signed with Texas.\n\nA triple jumper, high jumper, and basketball standout at Connally, McDonald played quarterback, wide receiver, and on defense in high school, allowing him to finish the cycle as a consensus four-star prospect ranked as the No. 74 player nationally and the No. 2 athlete, according to the 247Sports Composite rankings.\n\nThe athlete classification certainly fit McDonald, as it wasn’t clear whether he would grow into a linebacker in college even as he displayed the ability to play cornerback despite his height. As a freshman, McDonald m0ved between nickel back, linebacker, cornerback, and safety.\n\nWhile McDonald developed behind the scenes shuffling through positions to determine his future role, he played on three special teams units for the Horns as a true freshman, recording two tackles against Oklahoma State in the Big 12 Championship game.\n\nAs a sophomore, McDonald showed signs of becoming a rising star as he was thrust into playing time due to injuries, totaling 33 tackles, one tackle for loss, one interception, and one pass broken up with four starts over 14 games.\n\nMcDonald took another step forward as a full-time starter in 2025, leading the team in tackles with 73 (43 solo) thanks to late-season injuries sustained by redshirt senior safety Michael Taaffe and junior linebacker Anthony Hill Jr., notching four tackles for loss, three interceptions, three passes broken up, and a fumble return.\n\nWith McDonald returning, Texas has one starter back at the safety position with Taaffe exhausting his eligibility.",

    "fullText": "SAN ANGELO, Texas (Concho Valley Homepage) — Click the video above to relive the Wall Hawks’ road to the 2025 state championship.\n\nIf there’s one team in the Concho Valley enjoying its 2025 holiday season, it’s the Wall Hawks. The school brought home its first-ever football state title one week ago, but this year’s championship run didn’t come as a surprise to many people.\n\nKLST Sports Director Charles Bryce had a vision. During KLST and KSAN’s 2025 High School Football Preview Show on Aug 20, he said “I can’t wait to see some of these teams that have a really good shot at winning a state championship. Let’s see who can bring one home to the Concho Valley this year.”\n\nBryce’s preseason analysis aged very well. Four months later, Wall stood tall as the Concho Valley’s lone state champion. Wall’s second-year head coach Craig Slaughter also had a vision this season, and his squad’s road to glory was in the works for years.\n\n“It still probably hasn’t sunk in, [I’m] just proud,” Slaughter said. “[I’ve gotten] so many texts from people that have followed our program for a long time. We’ve been chasing it for a long time, we’ve been in the hunt for a long time and that’s before I got here. This program has been knocking on the door for a while and it’s awesome to get that done.”\n\nWhen Slaughter became head coach in 2024, he guided the Hawks to the Class 3A Division II State Semifinals which resulted in a heartbreaking 42-32 loss to the Gunter Tigers. That loss served as motivation for players and coaches heading into the next season. One year later, Wall got its revenge with a 28-25 state semis win over Gunter.\n\n“We knew how to handle ourselves much better,” Hawks senior right tackle Will Aldridge said. “On the sidelines, you could tell we weren’t out of this game. We still had a lot more football to play, and I think a big part of it was just that maturity level.”\n\n‘We’re a fourth quarter type of team,” Hawks senior running back Brady Neal said. “We’re very physical, we’ve got good chemistry. Even though we were down, we knew that just one play could get us back in it.”\n\nIn the ensuing state championship game versus the Newton Eagles, Wall’s commanding 25-8 halftime lead proved to be just enough to secure the win. The Hawks survived the Eagles’ second-half comeback attempt, which fell one point short as Wall held on to win 25-24.\n\n“I can’t give enough credit to our kids,” coach Slaughter said. “Their composure is awesome. They just keep playing, and they found themselves a state championship.”\n\nWall’s season-defining theme revolved around talent and depth. The Hawks’ stacked roster featured 23 seniors, giving them the edge over opponents in terms of experience.\n\n“Ours wasn’t just 23 players,” coach Slaughter said. “There were 23 leaders, strong kids, and just a talented roster. Some of the kids were waiting in line for reps for us, and it just speaks to the depth of that squad.”\n\nAfter many years of knocking on the doorstep, the Wall Hawks can finally call themselves state champions. This 2025 championship team will be remembered for many years to come.",

It provided a glimpse of the future: new offensive coordinator Holmon Wiggins, who remains the WR coach, should continue what former OC Collin Klein achieved this season, while his only job right now is to land one or two wide receivers from the transfer portal.\n\nWith KC Concepcion, who finished his only season in College Station with 61 receptions for 919 yards and nine touchdowns, paired with 1,450 all-purpose yards and two punt return touchdowns, declaring for the 2026 NFL Draft, it was reported that Kansas State transfer wide receiver Jayce Brown, who reportedly visited during the Aggies' CFP loss to Miami on Saturday, is one of Elko and Wiggins's primary targets.\n\nHowever, according to On3's Pete Nakos, former Auburn wide receiver Malcolm Simmons, who recently entered the transfer portal, holds a direct connection with Holmon Wiggins, who, during his time as Alabama's WR and assistant head coach, heavily recruited Simmons.\n\nAmong the early schools to watch for Auburn wide receiver Malcolm Simmons are Kentucky, Arkansas, Georgia and Texas A&M.\n\nFinishing his Auburn career with 65 receptions, 908 yards, and five touchdowns, Simmons was highly productive in the final two games of the 2025 season, reeling in 149 receiving yards and a touchdown against Mercer, and, in the Iron Bowl loss to Alabama, recorded 143 yards and a touchdown, averaging 47 yards per reception.\n\nLike Jayce Brown, Simmons will be highly coveted due to his speed and playmaking ability after the catch, and would be an immediate impact player alongside Texas A&M's speed 2026 wide receiver rotation, led by incoming junior Mario Craver.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M has been connected to Auburn transfer WR Malcolm Simmons",

    "fullText": "A Texas power developer is proposing to repurpose nuclear reactors from Navy warships to power the United States grid as the Trump administration pushes to secure massive amounts of energy for the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nHGP Intelligent Energy LLC filed an application to the Energy Department to redirect two retired reactors to a data centre project proposed at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, according to a letter submitted to the agency’s Office of Energy Dominance Financing. The project, filed for the White House’s Genesis Mission, would produce about 450-520 megawatts of around-the-clock electricity, or enough to power roughly 360,000 homes.\n\nIn theory, tapping the reactors could become one of the fastest ways to add baseload power to the grid as the U.S. struggles to meet surging power demand. Building new reactors — traditional big plants or next-generation smaller units — are years away, as are new big natural gas-fired plants. Repurposing military reactors for such civilian use, however, is unchartered territory.\n\nNaval aircraft carriers or submarines are each equipped with two reactors: A4W units made by Westinghouse Electric Co. or S8G-class units made by General Electric. Rewiring two of them would cost about US$1 million to US$4 million per megawatt, a fraction of building new reactor, according to the proposal. HGP’s plan includes a revenue share with the government, and the company would create a decommissioning fund.\n\nThe developer plans to file for a loan guarantee from the Energy Department, according to the letter. The project would require about US$1.8 billion to US$2.1 billion of private capital to build related infrastructure to prepare the reactors for general use, according to the proposal submitted to the DOE and seen by Bloomberg News. The first phase could be completed as soon as 2029, according to the proposal.\n\n“We already know how to do this safely and at scale, and we’re fortunate to have a solid base of investors and partners who share that vision,” HGP chief executive Gregory Forero said in a statement.\n\nWith assistance from Joe Deaux.",

McIvor hadn’t played since Oct 14, when he suffered a left shoulder injury. In his return, he completed 12 of 19 pass attempts for 199 passing yards and recorded a rushing touchdown.

    "description": "According to a source, Texas A&M is reportedly the top program to watch regarding Kansas State transfer WR Jayce Brown.",
    "fullText": "Just days after Texas A&M's 2025 season came to an end, losing to Miami 10-3 in the first round of the College Football Playoff, head coach Mike Elko will enter the offseason with plenty of questions regarding the offensive and defensive line, knowing that a ton of production will leave for the NFL and graduation, needing to secure starting level talent from the transfer portal.\n\nWith senior running back Le'Veon Moss off to the NFL after two injury-plagued seasons, combined with wide receiver KC Concepcion declaring for the 2026 NFL Draft, Elko and new offensive coordinator Holmon Wiggins will now be tasked with landing another receiver, and possibly another running back, which shouldn't be tough given the recent transfer additions.\n\nOne name to watch in the early stages, according to On3's Pete Nakos, is former Kansas State wide receiver Jayce Brown, who, despite former Texas A&M OC Collin Klein leaving to become Kansas State's new head coach, is reportedly considering the Aggies as one of his top destinations after Conecpcion's announcement.\n\nStanding at 6'0\" and 190 pounds, Brown led the Wildcats in receiving with 712 yards and five touchdowns, and was by far the most dependable receiver, and is a reliable deep threat due to his impressive speed and quickness, averaging 17.4 yards per reception. On paper, Brown is a plug-and-play receiver and would pair well with incoming junior Mario Craver and sophomore Ashton Bethel-Roman.\n\nIf the Aggies land Brown, this shores up the 2026 wide receiver room, which still lacks size, but will be one of the fastest units in the country.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M is the 'school of note' for transfer WR Jayce Brown",

    "fullText": "Air traffic controllers lost communication for about 10 minutes with a small Mexican Navy plane carrying a young medical patient and seven others before it crashed off the Texas coast in thick fog, killing at least six people, Mexico's government said Tuesday.\n\nThe plane was working with a nonprofit group transporting Mexican children with severe burns to a hospital in Galveston, near Houston, when the plane crashed Monday afternoon. Authorities believed the plane had landed, but the flight had lost contact with air controllers, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday in her morning briefing.\n\nTeams found the dead bodies of five people and pulled two survivors from the plane's wreckage, then set off on a daylong search in the waters near Galveston for 29-year-old Navy Lieutenant Luis Enrique Castillo. Castillo's family back in their rural town in southern Mexico were left scrambling for answers, hoping for the best for their missing son.\n\n“We don't know what to do,\" his father Eduardo Castillo said Tuesday. “All we can do is wait. We can’t go to the United States, we have no visa.\"\n\nThe search came to an end Tuesday night when search teams found Castillo's body. American authorities are investigating the the cause, but the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday that it could take a week or more to recover the aircraft.\n\n“What happened is very tragic,” Sheinbaum said in her morning press briefing, noting that sailors were among the dead.\n\nPlane was too low as it descended\n\nAs the twin turboprop Beech King Air 350i approached Sholes International Airport in Galveston, radar shows it was far too low, said Jeff Guzzetti, a former NTSB and Federal Aviation Administration crash investigator.\n\nA navigation system for the runway where the plane was supposed to land had been out of service for about a week, Guzzetti said. The system sends signals to the airplane cockpit that helps pilots navigate in the kind of bad weather that had enveloped the area. The fog was so thick that meteorologists estimated only about a half-mile of visibility.\n\nThe pilot should have aborted the landing if the runway wasn't visible at an altitude of 205 feet (62.5 meters), climbing back up before trying again or looking for another airport entirely, Guzzetti said.\n\nGuzzetti said the reported radar track shows that the pilot was descending rapidly below 200 feet (61 meters), a full 2 miles (3 kilometers) away from the runway.\n\n“Maybe there was some sort of mechanical malfunction,\" he said. “But just looking at the recorded flight track and comparing it with the weather and the airport equipment outage, seems to me that this landing approach should never have occurred.”\n\nThe plane crashed in a bay near the base of the causeway connecting Galveston Island to the mainland. The popular beach destination is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of Houston.\n\nSky Decker, a professional yacht captain who lives near the crash site, said he jumped in his boat to see if he could help. He picked up two police officers who guided him through the thick fog to the nearly submerged plane. Decker jumped into the water and found a badly injured woman trapped beneath chairs and other debris.\n\n“She had maybe 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of air gap to breathe in,\" he said. \"And there was jet fuel in there mixed with the water, fumes real bad. She was really fighting for her life.”\n\nHe said he also pulled out a man seated in front of her who had already died.\n\nEduardo Castillo gathered with the rest of his family and friends Tuesday afternoon in their small community of El Pantano in the sweltering southern Mexican state of Veracruz.\n\nThe father, who worked long hours as a carpenter to give his son the opportunities he never had, was desperately refreshing his phone every few minutes, looking for any news of their missing son. Mexico's Marines, he noted, had provided few other details than a call saying their son was missing.\n\nFramed pictures of Luis Enrique Castillo and his many diplomas coated a wall of their home. He and his wife were expecting a baby due in three months.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Castillo heard his phone ring and answered, hearing the words he had dreaded. His son was dead.\n\n“Now he's never going to meet his unborn child,” Eduard Castillo said as his family hugged and sobbed around him.\n\nInvestigators dig into the cause\n\nA spokesperson for the NTSB said in an email that investigators will review maintenance records, weather forecasts and air traffic control communications. A preliminary report is expected within 30 days.\n\nGuzzetti said the investigation also will likely look into how serious the young patient's medical condition was and how motivated the pilot was to land.\n\n“There have been previous accidents in the air medical community where pilots try to push their luck in order to save the patient,” he said.\n\nThe aircraft had a “very, very proven design,” said aviation safety expert John Cox. He said it’s the latest version of a series that has been in use since the 1960s and would have been outfitted with all the modern electronics, avionics and equipment.\n\nPlane was helping with medical mission\n\nMexico's Navy said the plane was helping with a medical mission in coordination with the Michou and Mau Foundation.\n\nThe charity was founded after a mother died trying to save her kids from a fire. One child died, while another survived after receiving treatment at Shriners Children's Texas in Galveston. Over 23 years, the foundation has helped transfer more than 2,000 patients to that hospital and other medical facilities with burn expertise, according to the charity's website.\n\nIn a social media post, the foundation offered condolences to the families of the crash victims.\n\nShriners Children’s Texas said in a statement that it learned of the crash with “profound sadness” but wasn't able to provide any information about the child's condition.\n\nCrash comes amid focus on aviation safety\n\nThis latest crash comes amid a year of intense scrutiny on aviation safety after a string of high-profile crashes and the flight disruptions during the government shutdown driven by the shortage of air traffic controllers.\n\nThe January midair collision between an Army helicopter and an airliner near Washington, D.C., was followed by the crash of a medical transport plane in Philadelphia. This fall’s fiery UPS plane crash only added to the concerns. Still, the total number of crashes in 2025 was actually down a bit from last year, and experts say flying remains safe overall.\n\nMarquez reported from El Pantano and Janetsky reported from Mexico City.

    "fullText": "The future of high school football is here, and it’s burning bright. From California to Florida, Texas to Pennsylvania, gridiron stars have performed all across the country the past few months to electrify on Friday nights. We’re unveiling our Sophomore All-American list – the names you need to know now, because you’ll be hearing about them all throughout the off-season and into 2026. These athletes aren’t just talented; they’re the game-changers from this past 2025 high school football campaign.\n\nQB: Lukas Prock, Hun School\nWe’d be hard pressed to not have Prock heading up this list as the country’s top quarterback when you look at production, talent and competition he faced in 2025. The 6-foot-2, 180-pound quarterback went up against the likes of teams in Archbishop Spalding (Md.), The St. James Academy (Md.), St. Frances Academy (Md.), The First Academy and IMG Academy. The signal caller finished the season completing 226 of 309 passes for 4,330 yards and 41 touchdowns.\n\nRB: Xander Edwards, The Bolles School (Fla.)\nEdwards had himself a breakout season playing for the FHSAA Class 2A state semifinalist Bolles bulldogs. The sophomore running back averaged a ridiculous 9.9 yards per carry and rushed for 2,629 and scored 44 times on the ground. Add in his 17 catches for 211 yards and Edwards finishes just shy of 3,000 all-purpose yards for the 2025 season.\n\nRB: Zaiden Jernigan, Louisville (MS)\nJernigan made his name well known throughout the Magnolia State this past 2025 season as the running back put up some of the top numbers of any back in the country when it came to sophomores. The running back rushed for 1,563 yards on 238 carries and scored 20 touchdowns. The sophomore also added 205 yards and four touchdowns out of the backfield.\n\nWR: Roye Oliver, Hamilton (Ariz.)\nOliver was as good as advertised anytime he took the field for Hamilton, finishing the season catching 92 passes for 1,839 yards and scoring 29 touchdowns. There’s little doubt that Oliver is one of the country’s best wide receivers, regardless of class as he proved himself this 2025 campaign.\n\nWR: Brysen Wright, Mandarin (Fla.)\nThe four-star do-everything has done it all just about for Mandarin this past season, with Wright catching 46 passes for 983 yards and 10 touchdowns. Wright has also seen plenty of time on the defensive side of the ball as well, notching 63 tackles and intercepting five passes. The sophomore also contributed in the punt return game, totaling 254 yards on six returns.\n\nWR: Eric McFarland, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nThough McFarland reclassified to the Class of 2027, he was considered a sophomore throughout the entire 2025 high school football season. McFarland has shown his versatility not only going downfield, but also on jet sweeps, pop passes and even just taking hand-offs. Through nine games, McFarland caught 29 passes for 595 yards and scored 11 touchdowns.\n\nOT: R’Monie Edwards, Cypress Ranch (TX)\nAt 6-foot-5, 260 pounds, the offensive tackle was near impossible to get by for opposing defensive ends down in the Lone Star State. Rated a four-star by the Rivals Industry Rankings, Edwards led the way up front for over 4,500 all-purpose yards, 58 touchdowns and 463 points scored in 2025.\n\nOL: Elisha Mueller, Servite (Calif.)\nPlaying up against some of the top high school football programs in the land, Mueller held his own and then some for the Friars. Mueller is interchangeable at either guard position and led the way for Servite’s offense that totaled over 3,500 all-purpose yards and 39 touchdowns.\n\nC: Hunter Hill, Peach County (Ga.)\nHill can play center or at either guard position as he did during the 2025 season for the 10-2 Peach County Trojans. The 6-foot-3, 305-pound interior offensive lineman was superb in Year 2 and helped the Trojans amass 4,500-plus yards of offense and scoring 58 total touchdowns.\n\nOL: George Selvie III, Sumner (Fla.)\nFamiliar with the name? That’s because his father, George Selvie, starred at USF and eventually in the NFL. Now the younger Selvie plays for his father at Sumner and has blossomed into one of the top offensive linemen in the country when it comes to sophomores. Selvie III paved the way for over 3,800 yards and 45 touchdowns for the Class 7A region finalist Stingrays.\n\nOT: Jamarios Canton, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nProtecting the right side of Jayden Wade on Friday nights, Canton proved anytime out on the field that he was the top offensive tackle of the 2028 class. At 6-foot-4, 260 pounds, the offensive tackle took on all comers and right out of the gates against Hoover (Ala.) was pancaking opposing defensive linemen.\n\nAll-Purpose: Gaige Weddle, Rancho Bernardo (Calif.)\nI mean, what didn’t Weddle do for Rancho Bernardo in 2025? The dual-threat quarterback threw for 2,224 yards and 19 touchdowns through the air. Weddle led the team in rushing with 679 yards on just 98 attempts and 10 scores. Oh and Weddle also led the team on defense with 101 tackles, two sacks and two interceptions. Like we said, what didn’t Weddle do? He was what you want in a all-purpose athlete.\n\nEdge: Asher Ghioto, The Bolles School (Fla.)\nNo matter where Ghioto lined up on the defensive line, the 6-foot-5, 240-pound EDGE rusher was causing havoc for opposing offensive linemen. Ghioto finished the season totaling 84 tackles, 35 for a loss and 23 sacks.\n\nDT: Kellan Hall, Christian Academy of Louisville (KY)\nAnchoring the Centurions’ defensive line all throughout their undefeated 15-0 run to the KHSAA Class 3A state championship. Hall recently received defensive first-team all-state honors playing on the defensive line. When it comes to interior defensive linemen, there’s very few as agile and quick like the 6-foot-4, 255-pound stalwart.\n\nDT: Cory Cunningham, Providence (N.C.)\nThe four-star 6-foot-4, 265-pound defensive tackle was a force in North Carolina’s Class 8A throughout the season. Cunningham was unblockable for many opposing offensive linemen as the defensive tackle racked up 60 tackles, 28 going for a loss and 15 quarterback takedowns.\n\nEdge: Jackson Vaughn, Bergen Catholic (N.J.)\nJust because the numbers might’ve went down a little from his freshman campaign doesn’t mean that Vaughn didn’t remain a factor when it came to EDGE rushers.

Mannings was deadly in the kick return game, compiling 335 return yards for the Indians.\n\nQB: Koa Malau’ulu, St. John Bosco (Calif.)\nRB: Taihj Moore, Deland (Fla.)\nRB: Kameron Battle, Carrollwood Day (Fla.)\nWR: Jaylen Addai, Shadow Creek (TX)\nWR: Jett Harrison, St. Joseph’s Prep (Pa.)\nWR: TJ Maddox, Winslow Township (N.J.)\nOT: Bryce Smalls, Archbishop Spalding (Md.)\nOL: Kris Scott, Taft (OH)\nC: Carl Noisette, Duluth (Ga.)\nOL: Maxx Jones, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nOT: Azhir Waddell, Dudley (N.C.)\nAll-Purpose: Deandre Bidden, Harper Woods (Mich.)\n\nEdge: Jalanie George, Desert Edge (Ariz.)\nDT: Kingston Brown, Carver (Ga.) \nDT: Jameer Whyce, Trotwood-Madison (OH)\nEdge: Darieon Prescott, Bolingbrook (IL)\nLB: Tysir Young, Middletown (DE)\nLB: Brayden Bonik, Ridge Point (TX)\nCB: Man Robinson, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nCB: Jermaine Cobbins, Springfield (Tenn.)\nS: Pole Moala, Leuzinger (Calif.)\nS: James Foster III, Lancaster (TX)\n\nPK: Luke Marchionni, Hamilton Southeastern (IN)\nP: Julian Trujillo, Eaglecrest (CO)\nReturn Specialist: Dillon Mitchell, C.E.
