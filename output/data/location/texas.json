    "fullText": "Jacob Rodriguez was sleeping on the floor of his brother’s apartment and learning how to really play defense when he joined Texas Tech for spring practice in 2022, right after a season as a quarterback at Virginia.\n\nSuddenly a walk-on on the other side of the ball, Rodriguez even wondered if he might get cut by the Red Raiders.\n\n\"They’re trying to weed everybody out because it’s coach (Joey) McGuire’s first offseason,\" he said. “So, I'm just out there trying to make the team and then focus on football. It was real weird, totally different position.”\n\nQB-turned-linebacker Rodriguez is now an AP All-American for fourth-ranked Tech, which is in the College Football Playoff for the first time. The team captain with a distinctive mustache, whose wife flies Black Hawk helicopters in the U.S. Army, has a collection of trophies for national defensive player of the year awards, and was fifth in the Heisman Trophy voting. He is the first FBS player in 20 years with at least five forced fumbles (he has seven), two fumble recoveries and four interceptions in the same season.\n\n“He’s just a man of consistency, a man of routine and he’s just a great leader overall,” said Tech senior edge rusher David Bailey, a first-year transfer and also an AP All-America first-teamer.\n\nThe Red Raiders (12-1), in McGuire's fourth season, play No. 5 Oregon (12-1) in the CFP quarterfinal Orange Bowl on New Year's Day. The first-time Big 12 Conference champions already have a school-record 12 wins.\n\nRodriguez won the Chuck Bednarik and Bronko Nagurski awards as the top defensive player, and the Dick Butkus Award as the top linebacker. He got the Lombardi Award that's for exceptional performance while embodying character and discipline like the award's namesake.\n\nRodriguez played a little bit of safety in high school, but when he got to Tech he hadn’t been a linebacker since middle school, when the approach was much different.\n\n“I had no clue what I was doing. I was just going see ball, hit ball,” he said. “You’re playing linebacker, but you don’t have to study film, and you don’t have to understand the position as much.”\n\nAs a prep starting quarterback, Rodriguez accounted for 10,136 total yards (7,085 passing, 3,051 rushing) and 106 touchdowns (68 passing, 38 rushing) as Wichita Falls Rider made the Texas Class 5A playoffs three years in a row. He was then an early enrollee at Virginia, which gave him a scholarship offer as a quarterback. He never threw a pass in his 12 games with the Cavaliers, but had 56 yards rushing and 65 receiving while used as a running back, receiver and tight end. He left there after a coaching change.\n\n“It’s just really cool to see the way that his story has developed, and the kind of guy that he is,” said fifth-year Tech quarterback Behren Morton, a fellow Texan who was in some of the same camps as Rodriguez before college. “He’s probably put on close to 50 pounds, and just totally transformed his body to looking like a mean linebacker.”\n\nRodriguez played special teams and some defensive packages during his Tech debut in 2022, when he had 29 tackles and began to embrace being on that side.\n\n“Really just knowing that I can make an impact whatever position I play. I’ve done it on the offensive side of the ball, I’ve done it on the defensive side of a ball, and I’ve done it on special teams. I can really play with anybody,\" he said. “That’s kind of when I figured I can do this. I saw myself progressing a lot on the defensive side of the ball, and week to week just getting better and better.”\n\nHe was limited to five games in 2023 after injuring his foot in the opener on a play that he forced and recovered a fumble. His 127 tackles last year were the most for a Tech player since Lawrence Flugence set an NCAA FBS record with 193 in 2002. He has 117 this season after Tech reportedly invested more than $7 million on transfers along the defensive front, including Bailey, second-team AP All-America interior lineman A.J. Holmes Jr., and third-teamer Lee Hunter.\n\nAs tough as Rodriguez is, the 6-foot-1, 235-pound linebacker said there is no doubt that his wife Emma is even tougher.\n\nThe high school sweethearts got married in July 2023. Emma graduated from the United States Military Academy and is now based at Fort Riley in Kansas.\n\n\"She's the best, and she does so much for me,\" Jacob Rodriguez said. \"It's weird, I feel like to everybody else, that we do long distance and have done it. But I mean to us, it’s normal. It’s something that we’ve always done.”\n\nWhile disappointed he didn't get an invitation to New York for the Heisman Trophy ceremony, Rodriguez was grateful and honored by the final results. His 17 first-place votes were nine more than Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin, the fourth-place finisher. Indiana QB Fernando Mendoza won the Heisman ahead of Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia and Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love.\n\n“I’m just so appreciative to even be in that conversation,\" Rodriguez said. \"That kind of hit home, was people really cared about me and see what the work that’s been done this year.”\n\nRodriguez has scored three touchdowns this season. He returned a fumble for a score against Oklahoma, and had short rushing TDs on his only carries when taking a direct snap in each of the last two regular-season games.\n\n“It was exciting and it was fun,” he said. “Those are the moments that I’ll never forget, where it’s just having fun playing football.”\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "description": "Duke was the only team inside the top 10 to drop a game last week.",
    "fullText": "It was a pretty quiet week of college basketball, but there was one stunning major upset to carry us through and shake up the top five.\n\nHere’s everything you missed in the seventh week of the regular season, and the latest Associated Press poll.\n\nIt was only a matter of time before Duke slipped, but Saturday night’s loss at Madison Square Garden seemed to come out of nowhere.\n\nThe Blue Devils, who jumped up by 17 points against a shorthanded Texas Tech team in the second half, let the Red Raiders come storming back to pick up an 82-81 upset win. That marked Texas Tech’s first win over a top-five team since 2022, and snapped a six-game losing streak against ranked opponents.\n\nThe win jumped Texas Tech up four spots to No. 15 in this week’s poll.\n\nThe loss, meanwhile, was the first for Duke in what has otherwise been a perfect start to the season. The Blue Devils entered Saturday with a perfect 11-0 record and four wins over ranked opponents — including three straight earlier this month, one over Michigan State and the other over defending national champion Florida.\n\nAs a result, Duke fell three spots to No. 6.\n\nDuke was actually the only team inside the top 10 to lose a game last week. Arizona held onto the No. 1 spot in the polls after a blowout win over San Diego State on Saturday, which got it to 11-0. Michigan remained at No. 2, too, after beating La Salle by 52 points on Sunday. Iowa State moved up a spot to No. 3, UConn took No. 4 and Purdue moved up to No. 5.\n\nWhile it didn’t matter much this time, as they rolled to a blowout win over DePaul, UConn leading scorer Solo Ball missed Sunday’s game with a minor wrist injury. Ball has averaged a team-high 15.4 points per game, and was fresh off a 26-point outing against Butler.\n\nThe next big loss came when Tennessee rolled over Louisville by 21 points on Tuesday, which snapped a three-game losing skid for the Vols. That launched them up to No. 19, while Louisville fell to No. 16.\n\nUnfortunately, we’re looking at a very slow week of college basketball ahead. The sport is largely taking a break over Christmas. So enjoy the time, and get ready for conference play to kick off across the board on the other side.\n\nAll times ET | * denotes neutral site\n\nMissouri at No. 20 Illinois | 8 p.m. | FS1 *\n\nThe full Associated Press men’s basketball poll from December 22, 2025.\n\n1.

    "title": "Remembering Richard Bell, Texas Tech football defensive coordinator",
    "description": "Texas Tech football has a defense for the ages this season. The architect of the Red Raiders' next best defenses, Richard Bell, died this month.",
    "fullText": "The Texas Tech football team's average yield of 10.92 points per game this season would be a school record for scoring defense in the modern era, defined by the National Football Foundation as 1950 and later.\n\nOver the past 60 years, Tech's next five stingiest defenses by average points allowed came in the five consecutive seasons from 1970-74. Those are the years Richard Bell was the Red Raiders' defensive coordinator, or head defensive coach, as he was commonly referenced.\n\n\"Oh, wow,\" said Tommy Cones, a Red Raiders defensive end who lettered from 1972-74. \"Well, that tells you a lot right there. Numbers don't lie, right?\"\n\n\"That's amazing. That's amazing,\" said Gaines Baty, a defensive end who lettered from 1970-72. \"Well, he was known across the country as a defensive expert.\"\n\nBell died on Dec. 13 in Woodstock, Georgia. He was 88.\n\nMore: Texas Tech football's Jacob Rodriguez on Heisman vote, awards circuit\n\nHis passing prompted reflection among those who played under him.\n\n\"Richard Bell was the epitome of character, integrity, intensity, passion and excellence,\" Baty said. \"He set a high standard for the football team, as well as personally for every player on that team.\"\n\nBell came to Texas Tech from West Virginia with head coach Jim Carlen in 1970 and followed Carlen to South Carolina after the 1974 season. Tech and Vanderbilt played to a 6-6 tie in the Peach Bowl on Dec. 28, 1974, before Vandy coach Steve Sloan switched programs. Late on New Year's Eve, Sloan announced he was staying at Vanderbilt, but he changed his mind and accepted the Texas Tech job on New Year's Day.\n\nThe next day, the Avalanche-Journal reported Bell, according to Texas Tech insiders, \"would have landed the job had Sloan not reconsidered during the wee hours of New Year's morn.\"\n\nBell was a college head coach for only one year, going 4-7 in 1982 at South Carolina.\n\nHis long coaching career included stints as defensive coordinator at West Virginia (1968-69), Texas Tech (1970-74), South Carolina (1975-81), Duke (1983-87), East Carolina (1988), Georgia (1989-93), Navy (1994) and Air Force (1995-2006). The Arkansas native was a captain on Frank Broyles' first Razorbacks team in 1958 and made early coaching stops at Virginia Military (1962-63) and Georgia Tech (1964-67).\n\nHe worked under College Football Hall of Fame coaches Bobby Dodd and Fisher DeBerry at Georgia Tech and Air Force, respectively, and alongside Hall of Fame coach Bobby Bowden when Bowden was offensive coordinator at West Virginia.\n\nBefore leaving Georgia, Bell recruited a young defensive back named Kirby Smart.\n\n\"He just knew how to get the most out of every player,\" Cones said, \"and he had some really, really good pep talks. He was such a professional in terms of communicating, and you'd get really pumped up when he's your coach. He had a certain charisma about him. He would say the right thing, the things you wanted to hear before you went out to win a game for him.\"\n\nFormer Tech defensive tackle David Knaus described Bell as calm, controlled, thorough and confident. Knaus, an all-Southwest Conference honoree in 1973, said Bell's style was a polar opposite of Bill Parcells, who followed him as Tech defensive coordinator.\n\n\"Other than both of them being tremendous coaches, they couldn't have been more different in their styles,\" Knaus said. \"As an example, I never heard profanity ever uttered from coach Bell. He barely ever needed to raise his voice. It was always controlled correction.\"\n\nTech went 8-4 in 1970, holding opponents to 13.5 points per game. The Red Raiders slipped to 4-7 in 1971, though the defense yielded only 12.5 points per game, and defensive back Marc Dove was Southwest Conference defensive player of the year. Bell's units held opponents to 14.2 points per game in 1972, 15.3 in 1973 and 13.8 in 1974.\n\nThe 1972 team finished 8-4 with a Sun Bowl loss to North Carolina. The 1973 team finished 11-1 with a Gator Bowl conquest of Tennessee.\n\nWhile serving as the Red Raiders' defensive coordinator, Bell was position coach for defensive ends and linebackers. End Bruce Dowdy earned all-Southwest Conference recognition in 1970, linebacker Larry Molinare in 1971 and Cones in 1974.\n\n\"He took a lot of running backs and good athletes,\" Baty said, \"and turned them into linebackers and defensive ends. That was kind of his way to do it. He liked a good athlete that would hit you.\"\n\nBaty came to Tech as a running back, quickly moved to linebacker and then played his entire varsity career at defensive end. Noseguard Don Rives was a second-team all-American in 1972. In the spring before that season, Rives called Baty \"the best defensive end in this league\" and \"the most underrated player in this conference.\"\n\nTo the extent that was true, Baty chalked it up to his coach.\n\n\"He made me as a player,\" Baty said. \"Not that I was anything special, but whatever I was is because of Richard Bell.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Lubbock Avalanche-Journal: Remembering Richard Bell, Texas Tech football defensive coordinator",

    "fullText": "Heather Sterling stepped into the ring at the Texas Game Warden Training Center, ready to face an ambush by instructors acting as violent assailants.\n\nThe four-on-one drill is a rite of passage for those training to be game wardens, sworn officers who enforce state conservation laws. Nationwide, thousands of local and state police recruits are allowed into the profession only after passing similar drills – simulated fights for their lives.\n\nThe barrage of force against Sterling came rapidly, video obtained by The Associated Press shows. A surprise push from behind threw her to the floor. A right-handed punch to the back of the head knocked her down. Within two minutes, she was struck at least seven times in the head, the last blow knocking off her wrestling helmet.\n\n“Protect yourself!” an instructor yelled.\n\nSterling completed the drill but suffered a concussion. A dozen of her classmates — a third in all — were injured that day as they were repeatedly punched, tackled on a gym floor and thrown against padded walls, records show.\n\nWhile the drill was physically punishing, their experience was not unique. Since 2005, similar drills at law enforcement academies nationwide have been linked to at least a dozen deaths and hundreds of injuries, some resulting in disability, an AP investigation has found.\n\nEditor’s note: This is the third installment of AP’s Dying to Serve series. Find the previous stories here and here.\n\nThe drills — frequently referred to as RedMan training for the brand and color of protective gear worn by participants – are intended to teach law enforcement recruits how to defend themselves against combative suspects. They’re among the most challenging tests at police academies. Law enforcement experts say that when properly designed and supervised, they teach new officers critical skills for handling high-stress situations.\n\nBut critics say they can put recruits at risk of physical and mental abuse that runs some promising officers out of the profession. Academies have wide latitude in running such exercises, given a lack of national standards governing police training.\n\nSterling quit the academy after her drill. She's now speaking out, hoping to spark change in training practices nationwide.\n\n“I’m worried that someone is going to get killed,” said Sterling, who'd previously worked as a senior game warden and defensive tactics instructor in Wyoming. “This is a poorly disguised assault.”\n\nAn investigation by the agency that regulates law enforcement training found no wrongdoing in how the drill was conducted. An academy official told investigators the goal was to “overwhelm the cadet physically and mentally to force them to think while physically exhausted.”\n\nAn expert who reviewed the case told AP injuries happen during volatile training environments nationwide, but the Texas drill stood out for its design — recruits could not use force to defend themselves against the onslaught of assailants. He said the number of injuries was concerning.\n\n“To teach cadets how and when to defend themselves, only to put them in a doomsday scenario with the instruction that they’re not allowed to fight back, does not match any training curriculum I’ve seen,” said David Jude, a retired Kentucky State Police academy commander.\n\nA Wyoming game warden moves back to Texas\n\nIn October 2024, Sterling started the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department’s eight-month academy in rural central Texas, which boasts of producing “the best-trained conservation officers in the country.”\n\nGame wardens — called conservation officers or wildlife troopers in some states — enforce hunting and fishing laws. They carry firearms, have arrest powers, are often among the first to respond to emergencies and rescue missions.\n\nSterling said she loved serving as a game warden for nearly five years in Wyoming, where she sometimes shooed moose and mountain lions away from towns. Patrolling without backup, she said, she had some “very tense conversations” with suspects and had to restrain some in handcuffs.\n\nShe said almost everyone she encountered during hunting season was armed and potentially dangerous, but she prided herself on responding alertly and calmly. She never had to fight a suspect, and none of the 40 wardens she taught self-defense had been in a significant use-of-force incident.\n\nSterling applied in Texas to live closer to family, hoping for a similar law-enforcement role in her home state. She grew up as the daughter of a Dallas police officer and ran track and cross-country at Texas A&M.\n\nThe academy scheduled the four-on-one drill for Dec. 13, 2024, after five weeks of arrest and control training.\n\nInstructors told cadets they couldn't defend themselves and were only to punch and kick a shield held by instructors, Sterling recalled. They discussed how some cadets had been seriously injured and terminated from previous academies for performing poorly.\n\nSterling told AP she was confused by the drill’s purpose. She'd never been ambushed by one person, let alone four. If that happened, she’d be able to use a firearm or other force to defend herself. As an instructor, she said, she would have never approved such a scenario or allowed punches to the head and neck.\n\nA female classmate who had previously worked as a police officer resigned rather than participate. She later told investigators she saw the drill as inappropriate and part of an academy culture of unprofessional training and hazing.\n\nBut Sterling felt she had no choice if she wanted to stay in her profession. She completed a cardio exercise, and the drill began.\n\nCombat drills take various forms nationwide\n\nAcademies have discretion to design training within state guidelines, and AP found the drills take many forms at local police, county sheriff and state departments. They’re sometimes called “combat training,” “Fight Day” or “stress reaction training.”\n\nRecruits like Sterling must ward off several assailants at once. Others fight a series of instructors, one after another. Some academies intentionally use larger, more skilled instructors. In Kentucky, one scenario requires fighting a combative suspect in a pool.\n\nThe stated goals are generally the same: to use skills learned in the academy to fend off or subdue assailants and to never give up.\n\nRecruits and instructors wear protective gear to cushion their heads from blows. But there are no uniform safety guidelines, including whether academies must have medical personnel on site.\n\nLawyers for some Black and female former trainees have alleged that instructors targeted their clients with excessive force to try to run them out of the profession. Several of the deaths have been of Black men hoping to join disproportionately white police forces.\n\nAmid the deaths and criticism, experts are encouraging academy directors to retire or modify any problematic drills.\n\nThe drills “can quickly devolve into abusive rites of passage” without appropriate focus and oversight, said Brian Baxter, who oversaw training at the Texas Department of Public Safety and now leads a group that studies the use of force. Some instructors want to win rather than allow recruits to practice their skills, he added.\n\n“The idea that we’re just punching each other to see who’s toughest ... that’s when it becomes inappropriate,” said Baxter, whose former agency overhauled its practices after a trooper died in 2005 from getting hit several times in the head. “There needs to be a problem that’s being solved by this training. And that problem needs to be directly related to public service.”\n\nFor this Texas academy class, injuries were widespread\n\nFor Sterling, the drill came to an end when she simulated holding her assailants at gunpoint and put them in handcuffs.\n\nLater that day, she had a pounding headache. Her knee swelled, and she’d skinned her elbow on the floor.\n\nAt least 13 of 37 cadets reported injuries: concussion symptoms; a fractured wrist; a torn MCL; sprained wrists and knees; a bruised nose, records show.\n\nTwo recruits needed surgery. Some were told the injuries were due to their lack of preparation and poor technique, and had to redo the drill.\n\nSterling said she wasn't offered medical care. She recalled vomiting while driving herself for emergency treatment. A doctor found she suffered a concussion that resulted from an assault, a medical record provided by Sterling shows.\n\nSterling had passed the drill, but turned in her resignation.\n\n“I have a very high sense of what is right and what is wrong,\" she told AP. \"I did not want to be part of what was happening at the academy anymore.”\n\nDeaths and injuries across the country\n\nNationwide, deaths and injuries have been blamed on a mix of trauma from punches and other force, overexertion, heat stroke, dehydration, and organ failure.\n\nIn August, 30-year-old Jon-Marques Psalms died two days after a training exercise at the San Francisco Police Academy. He suffered a head injury while fighting an instructor in a padded suit.\n\nAn autopsy found his death was an accident caused by complications of muscle and organ damage “in the setting of a high-intensity training exercise.” His family has filed a legal claim against the city and hired experts for a second autopsy.\n\nIn November 2024, a 24-year-old Kentucky game warden recruit died after fighting an instructor in a pool to the point of collapse, video obtained by AP shows. William Bailey’s death was ruled an accidental drowning due to a “sudden cardiac dysrhythmia during physical exertion.”\n\nA year earlier, a Denver police recruit had both legs amputated after a training fight that his attorney called a “barbaric hazing ritual.” An Indiana recruit died of exertion after he was pummeled by a larger instructor, and a classmate was disabled after fighting the same man.\n\nInvestigations of Austin’s police academy in Texas found that physical and psychological abuse from such exercises resulted in “a significant number” of cadets injured, ranging from dehydration to broken bones, and led to reforms. Black and female cadets represented a disproportionate number of those who were injured and quit.\n\nMacho Products Inc., which sells RedMan Training Gear nationwide, cautions in its warranty that such training “always presents risks of accidental injury, disability, and death that must be assumed by all participants.\" The document says risks can be minimized through “carefully planned scenarios conducted at appropriate levels of force.” A company spokesperson didn’t respond to AP's request for comment on recent deaths and injuries.\n\nFormer cadet compares the drill to a gang initiation ritual\n\nAlarmed by the injuries to Sterling and others, a state lawmaker's office contacted the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement to seek an investigation.\n\nAfter reviewing videos, investigating the injuries, and interviewing instructors and some recruits, the investigation found the drill was conducted in a “control and organized manner, with safety measures in place and training objectives clearly communicated.” The videos did not show instructors acting overly aggressive to Sterling, or any other “actions that were inappropriate or inconsistent with the established training guidelines,” it found.\n\n“While multiple cadets sustained minor to moderate injuries during the drill, the majority recovered without extended medical consequences or changes to their training status,\" the report said.\n\nThe Texas Parks and Wildlife Department declined to comment and refused to release records, citing the potential for litigation.\n\nSterling, who has returned to Wyoming and still works in law enforcement, was outraged by the state's defense of the drill, which she compared to a gang initiation ritual.\n\n“New members are physically beaten down by the gang membership,” she said, “which now considers you as its property.”",

The Eagles then started this season 0-2 with losses to Creekside (Ga.) and North Crowley.\n\nBut they’ve rounded more into form from there, winning 12 of their next 13 contests, with the only defeat in that span to Duncanville, which played for the 6A Division I championship earlier on Saturday.\n\nDeSoto avenged last season’s playoff defeat to Longview by beating the Lobos in the area round, 60-28. The Eagles have scored at least 56 points in all five playoff wins, including last week, when they rallied in the second half to defeat previously undefeated Southlake Carroll, 57-44.\n\nSheldon King enters its first state championship game at 13-2. The Panthers’ lone two defeats came to Dickinson, which reached the 6A DI regional finals, and Galena Park North Shore, which played for the 6A DI title earlier on Saturday.\n\nIn the playoffs, King scored at least 50 points in its first three games. Two weeks ago, in the regional final round, the Panthers got past Humble Summer Creek, 24-21, before downing defending 6A DII state champion Austin Vandegrift, 58-41, in the semifinals last week.\n\nNow, in the final game of the 2025 Texas high school football season, King wants to conclude things with its first title while DeSoto attempts to continue a dynastic run.\n\nFollow The Sporting News correspondent Buck Ringgold (@Bucks_Ballpark) for all of the live updates and scoring from Arlington.\n\nScroll down for live score and game updates from kickoff to the postgame.

    "fullText": "McKINNEY, Texas (AP) — Court documents detailing the divorce of Republican U.S. Senate candidate and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and his wife, state Sen. Angela Paxton, were released Friday by order of a judge, months after she filed citing “biblical grounds.”\n\nThe initial filing showed that Angela Paxton sought the divorce on the grounds that Ken Paxton had committed adultery, but included no additional details. She had previously referenced “recent discoveries” when announcing the filing on social media in July. In a separate filing, Ken Paxton denied the allegations in the divorce petition. Future filings will also be released to the public after the Paxtons and a coalition of media outlets came to an agreement.\n\n“It’s a victory, I think, for the American public and for the Texas voters,” Tyler Bexley, an attorney for the media intervenors, told reporters after the judge ordered the documents unsealed.\n\nThe divorce and the surrounding speculation have only fueled attacks against Paxton in one of the nation’s most heated Republican primaries as he seeks to unseat Sen. John Cornyn. Whether the divorce details resonate with voters remains to be seen, with the Senate primary set for March 3. Despite years of controversy, the three-term attorney general has remained competitive in the race, which includes Rep. Wesley Hunt.\n\nThe divorce comes after 38 years of marriage, during which Angela Paxton had supported her husband through a series of legal troubles, including state and federal corruption investigations. A state securities fraud indictment against Ken Paxton was dismissed after a 2024 plea deal in which he agreed to pay restitution and complete community service, and the Justice Department dropped a federal corruption probe earlier this year.\n\nAngela Paxton also stood by Ken Paxton's side during that impeachment trial, which publicly exposed an extramarital affair. The 2023 impeachment trial ended in an acquittal for him.\n\nPaxton’s support in Texas has remained strong amid a decade of legal troubles. He won reelection in 2022 by nearly 10 percentage points.\n\nPaxton launched his bid to unseat Cornyn in April and has since drawn attacks from Senate Republicans’ campaign arm, with some in the party concerned that while Paxton could prevail in the GOP primary, he may complicate the general election and force national Republicans to spend heavily to hold the seat. On the Democratic side, U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett and state Rep. James Talarico are facing off in their party’s primary.\n\nGroups supporting Cornyn have spent more than $21 million on television ads this year, according to AdImpact, to promote the four-term senator and attack Paxton.\n\n“What Ken Paxton has put his family through is truly repulsive and disgusting,” National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesperson Joanna Rodriguez said in July. “No one should have to endure what Angela Paxton has, and we pray for her as she chooses to stand up for herself and her family during this difficult time.”\n\nPaxton has been a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, while Cornyn has at times drawn criticism within his own party for working with Democrats. Trump’s endorsement is expected to be a decisive factor in Texas, which he won in 2024 by nearly 14 percentage points. Trump has not yet endorsed in the race.\n\nJudge Robert Brotherton approved the agreement on Friday to release the records, which had been sealed following a request by Angela Paxton shortly after she filed. Another judge signed the agreed order to seal the records. In a filing after media outlets and the nonprofit Campaign for Accountability intervened to have the documents unsealed, Ken Paxton said he was opposed to the documents being publicly released.\n\nBexley said Friday that the media outlets he represents believe that voters have the right to know information about the case as “they are making decisions in the upcoming elections.”\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of Ken Paxton at https://apnews.com/hub/ken-paxton.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe University of Texas athletic department has been ranked the most valuable in college sports for 2025, according to a CNBC valuation released this week. Texas’s program is estimated at $1.48 billion, a 16% increase from the prior year and enough to vault the Longhorns past leader Ohio State.\n\nOhio State which held the top spot in last year’s ranking, slipped to second despite a 2% valuation increase, landing at approximately $1.35 billion.\n\nCNBC’s reporter Michael Ozanian values the 75 most valuable college athletic programs at a combined $51.2 billion, up 13% from 2024. The surge reflects escalating revenue streams, including media rights, sponsorships and the expanding impact of name, image and likeness (NIL) deals for student-athletes.\n\nTexas A&M retains the No. 3 spot at roughly $1.32 billion, while Georgia and Michigan round out the top five, each valued at about $1.16 billion. Notre Dame is sixth at $1.13 billion, followed by Tennessee at $1.12 billion and USC at $1.10 billion. Alabama and Nebraska are also among the top 10, all topping the $1 billion threshold.\n\nOf the top 25 athletic departments, 12 programs hail from the Southeastern Conference, with multiple SEC schools valued above $1.3 billion. Oregon sit just below the billion-dollar mark, despite a lucrative tie to Nike.\n\nThe widening valuations demonstrate how the business of college sports continues to grow, fueled largely by football revenues and lucrative conference television deals. The rise of NIL compensation packages has further broadened the financial abilities of elite programs, with some universities leveraging star athletes to enhance revenue and marketability.\n\nThe annual valuation shows a shifting landscape in collegiate athletics, where financial muscle increasingly figures into competitive balance and strategic planning across the four major conferences.\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nPat McAfee delivers reality check to Diego Pavia for Heisman weekend antics\n\nFernando Mendoza won't keep the Heisman Trophy\n\nWhy LSU should be extremely nervous about Michigan firing Sherrone Moore",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nARLINGTON, TEXAS - Two teams that have won state titles this century face off Friday morning for the chance to claim more hardware.\n\nStephenville and Kilgore square off at AT&T Stadium in the Texas University Interscholastic League 4A Division I championship game.\n\nLIVE STREAM:Victory+ (Victory Plus) will stream for free all 12 UIL state championship games.\n\nIn Stephenville’s case, the Yellow Jackets are trying to continue a trend. They have made the state title game for the seventh time in program history, and in the previous six, they have won it all, winning in 1993, 1994, 1998, 1999, 2012 and 2021.\n\nStephenville enters Friday’s latest title tilt at 15-0 overall. Among the Jackets’ wins was a 28-12 regular-season decision against Ruston (La.), which played in last week’s Louisiana Non-Select Division I title game.\n\nLast week, Stephenville got a field goal in the final seconds to upend defending state champion Celina, 24-21.\n\nThis is Kilgore’s second straight trip to the title game, having lost to Celina last season. Kilgore’s first championship game appearance was in 2004, and the Bulldogs claimed the title that season, and they also returned in 2013.\n\nKilgore dropped its season opener to Carthage - which is playing for the 4A Division II championship later on Friday - but have reeled off 14 straight wins, the latest a 49-0 win against La Vernia in last week’s semifinal round.\n\nFollow The Sporting News correspondent Buck Ringgold (@Bucks_Ballpark) for all of the live updates and scoring from Arlington.\n\nScroll down for live score and game updates from kickoff to the postgame. Refresh this page for the latest.\n\n- Kilgore will force Stephenville to punt as we have reached the two-minute warning.\n\n- INTERCEPTION STEPHENVILLE. Whatchoo talkin' bout, Willis? Willis Jackson makes a diving grab in the end zone for Stephenville's third takeaway on the day, stopping Kilgore's potential drive. Still scoreless with 2:37 left in the half.\n\n- Stephenville is called for a personal foul penalty, and Kilgore now has a first-and-goal at the Jackets' 7-yard line with less than five minutes to go in the half.\n\n- On a third down play, Kilgore QB Kayson Brooks finds receiver Tyler Johnigan along the sideline and Johnigan is able to move forward for a first down near the Stephenville 20.\n\n- FUMBLE RECOVERY KILGORE. Ball falls out on a running play, and Kilgore's Bi'syn Williams is there to scoop it up and he has a long return to just past midfield in Stephenville territory with 7:02 left in the half. First takeaway for the Ragin' Red defense.\n\n- Stephenville converts a fourth down as Trot Jordan finds Adan Jergins for a gain inside the Kilgore 30. We are under nine minutes to go in the half.\n\n- Stephenville had 46 yards of total offense in the first quarter, while Kilgore had 45. But the Jackets have already forced two turnovers.\n\nUIL 4A Div.

The ball bounces all the way to the Stephenville 28-yard line as the opening quarter comes to an end.\n\n- Stephenville reaches the Kilgore 25 before the drive stalls. Jackets try a 41-yard field goal, but the kick is short. Bulldogs take over with 1:38 left in the quarter.\n\n- Stephenville converts on a fourth down just past midfield on a short run from Zyler McClendon with more than five minutes to go in the half.\n\n- FUMBLE RECOVERY STEPHENVILLE. Stephenville gets its second takeaway, as the Jackets forced a fumble and recovered it. After a lengthy replay review, the ruling is upheld. Hudson Butchee, who earlier had the interception, forced the fumble, and teammate Cooper Fergeson landed on it near the Stephenville 45.\n\n- Another third-down chance for Stephenville but a pass is overthrown. Jackets go for it on fourth down, but Kilgore linebacker Isaiah Watters brings down quarterback Trot Jordan for a loss. Bulldogs take over at their 41 with 7:25 left in the opening period.\n\n- Stephenville tailback Zyler McClendon picks up a first down on a third-down play. Jackets have the ball near Kilgore's 35.\n\n- INTERCEPTION STEPHENVILLE. Kilgore makes a first down on its opening drive, but on a third-down play, a pass gets picked off by the Jackets' Hudson Butchee right at midfield.

    "description": "Texas Pacific Land has generated substantial returns for long-term investors as Permian Basin oil and gas production has surged.",
    "fullText": "Texas Pacific Land is a high-margin cash cow.\n\nIts land is valuable because it's located in the largest oil-and-gas-producing region in the United States.\n\nThe company is one of the safest ways to invest in growing oil and gas production.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Texas Pacific Land ›\n\nNetflix captured the spotlight in November when it executed its long-awaited 10-for-1 stock split. With just two weeks left in 2025, many investors probably figure they'll have to wait for 2026 for more high-profile splits.\n\nEarlier this month, S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) component Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE: TPL) announced a 3-for-1 stock split. Trading of the split-adjusted shares will take place on Dec. 23.\n\nHere's why Texas Pacific is no ordinary oil and gas company and why the high-margin cash cow could be an excellent gift for your portfolio this December.\n\nTexas Pacific's stock split will triple the number of shares outstanding while reducing the share price by two-thirds, making it easier for investors to buy one full share of the company at around $280 per share. This compares to around $840 per share at the time of this writing.\n\nStock splits can indicate that management is confident in a company's future earnings growth and thus, a higher future stock price. Even though stock splits don't impact a company's value or market capitalization, they're still generally received favorably by investors.\n\nWhat makes Texas Pacific's split particularly interesting is that the stock is down 24.1% year to date -- but stock splits tend to occur after a stock has run up in price. To make matters even more interesting, the company issued a 3-for-1 stock split in March 2024.\n\nIt's incredibly rare for a company to issue stock splits in back-to-back years, but Texas Pacific more than doubled last year, has crushed the S&P 500 over the last five years, and is up 18-fold over the last decade. There are plenty of reasons to believe it has a long runway for future earnings growth.\n\nThe oil and gas industry is capital-intensive. Upstream exploration and production companies are the most sensitive to fluctuations in oil and gas prices. Midstream companies, which transport and store hydrocarbons, tend to have less price sensitivity due to long-term contracts but are incredibly capital-intensive and depend on growing demand to justify infrastructure spending. Similarly, the margins of downstream refining and marketing companies can fluctuate based on input costs, such as oil prices and the cyclical demand for refined products.",

    "description": "Taking a look at the 2025 Miami Hurricanes and Texas A&M Aggies as Ohio State awaits winner for Cotton Bowl showdown.",
    "fullText": "The Ohio State Buckeyes are gearing up to face either the Miami Hurricanes or the Texas A&M Aggies in just under two weeks in a College Football Playoff Cotton Bowl quarterfinal. Ohio State would be favored against either opponent, but both bring distinct challenges and would pose legitimate tests on a big stage.\n\nAs it stands, Texas A&M is a 3.5-point favorite over Miami, with that matchup set to be played on the Aggies’ home field. That raises an obvious question: who would the Buckeyes rather see across the sideline? And who exactly are the 2025 Hurricanes and Aggies?\n\nTo answer that, let’s take a closer look at how each team’s season has unfolded so far, breaking down their strengths, weaknesses, and what Ohio State can realistically expect from either opponent on New Year’s night in Arlington at 7:30 p.m. ET.\n\nMiami is a fascinating case study, and I think they are quietly one of the stronger CFP teams in the 2025 bracket. The Hurricanes opened the season with a statement win over Notre Dame, a result that ultimately played a major role in punching their ticket to the Playoff. They followed that up with five straight victories before stumbling against a feisty Louisville team, 24–21, in a game where quarterback Carson Beck threw four interceptions.\n\nMiami bounced back with a blowout win over Stanford, only to suffer another setback the following week in an overtime loss to SMU, again plagued by turnovers as Beck tossed two interceptions. From that point on, however, the Hurricanes flipped the switch. They won every remaining game by 17 points or more, and Beck threw just one interception over the final four contests.\n\nOffensively, Miami ranks No. 27 nationally in total offense and features playmakers across the board. Running back Mark Fletcher is a reliable and physical runner who finished with 10 rushing touchdowns while averaging 4.9 yards per carry. The wide receiver room is deep and diverse, highlighted by BYU transfer Keelan Marion, LSU transfer CJ Daniels, and freshman phenom Malachi Toney. Toney has been electric, leading the team in receptions with 84, yards with 970, and tying for the team lead in receiving touchdowns with seven. The real engine of this offense is the offensive line. As expected under head coach Mario Cristobal, the foundation of this unit is built up front. Beck has been sacked just nine times all season, and both the run and pass games have consistently operated in clean pockets and wide-open lanes.\n\nDefensively, Miami has been just as impressive. The Hurricanes rank No. 11 nationally, allowing only 19 touchdowns and an average of 277.8 yards per game. Miami is built to control the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball, and the centerpiece is defensive lineman Rueben Bain Jr., a projected top-10 pick in April’s NFL Draft and one of the most dominant pass rushers in the country. Bain combines elite power, quick hands, and a deep pass-rush arsenal to overwhelm offensive linemen in both the run and pass game.\n\nMiami also invested heavily in its secondary this past offseason, and the payoff has been clear. The Hurricanes boast two cornerbacks with four interceptions apiece, while the linebackers do a solid job of keeping plays in front of them and limiting explosive gains. The defensive line is special, and the back end is more than capable of capitalizing on the pressure it creates.\n\nIf Beck stays clean and makes sound decisions in the pocket, especially by limiting turnovers, Miami becomes a difficult out. They control the trenches, protect their quarterback, and feature difference-makers on both sides of the ball.\n\nNot long ago, Texas A&M was viewed as part of the sport’s top tier, grouped with teams like Ohio State and Indiana, and even discussed by some fans and analysts as the best team in the country. Now, the Aggies enter the postseason as the No. 7 seed, carrying more questions after closing the regular season with a loss to Texas.\n\nLike Miami, A&M owns a narrow shootout win over Notre Dame, beating the Irish by one point in Week 3. The rest of the season, however, was filled with blowouts and close calls. The Aggies survived Auburn at home by six points, outlasted Arkansas 45–42, and escaped South Carolina 31–30 before their undefeated run ended with a 10-point loss to the Longhorns in Week 12. Head coach Mike Elko deserves credit for navigating those tight spots, but Texas A&M also exposed some real vulnerabilities along the way, particularly at quarterback.\n\nMarcel Reed is a dynamic talent, but he dealt with turnover issues similar to Miami’s Carson Beck. Reed finished the season with 10 interceptions and three fumbles, mistakes that often put the Aggies in early holes. Still, his ability to flip a game on its head is undeniable. The South Carolina matchup is the perfect example. A&M trailed 30–3 at halftime, with Reed already responsible for two interceptions and a fumble. In the second half, he caught fire, finishing with 439 yards and three touchdowns to engineer a stunning comeback victory.\n\nOffensively, Texas A&M ranks 20th in total offense and features a receiver group that mirrors Miami’s in both depth and talent. NC State transfer KC Concepcion, a likely first-round pick, Mississippi State transfer Mario Craver, and freshman Ashton Bethel-Roman form the core of the passing attack. Together, they accounted for 18 of Reed’s 25 passing touchdowns. On the ground, the Aggies deploy a true three-headed monster in Rueben Owens II, Le’Veon Moss, and Reed himself. All three averaged more than five yards per carry and scored at least five rushing touchdowns. As with Miami, the offensive line is a major strength. Reed was sacked just 10 times all season, and the fact that four different runners averaged over five yards per carry on at least 41 attempts is staggering.\n\nDefensively, Texas A&M ranks No. 19 nationally and features one of the most disruptive pass rushers in the country in Cashius Howell, who recorded 11.5 sacks in 2025. The Aggies totaled 41 sacks as a team and recovered six fumbles, though they managed just three interceptions. The defensive line consistently pressures quarterbacks, but the unit has shown vulnerability against explosive offenses, both on the ground and through the air. That inconsistency showed up in games where A&M surrendered 40 points to Notre Dame, 42 to Arkansas, 25 to LSU, and 30 to South Carolina. The defense is solid, but far from lockdown.\n\nWith Marcel Reed under center, Texas A&M always has a puncher’s chance. The Aggies have the firepower to go blow-for-blow with anyone in the country, and their defense has a knack for generating timely sacks in critical moments. If Reed stays protected and cuts down on mistakes, this is a dangerous team capable of catching fire at the right time.\n\nI view Miami and Texas A&M as very similar teams, and Ohio State should expect both offenses to prioritize establishing the run to set up explosive plays downfield with their dynamic wide receivers. On the defensive side, each will likely take a page from Indiana’s game plan against the Buckeyes by dialing up creative blitz packages, testing the Ohio State offensive line, and trying to make Julian Sayin uncomfortable in the pocket.\n\nI have Miami pulling out a win in College Station, largely because I trust Carson Beck to avoid a turnover-heavy performance. Texas A&M is tied for 128th nationally in interceptions forced, one of the worst marks in the country. If Beck limits his mistakes to fewer than two turnovers, I think Miami comes out on top.\n\nOhio State will be patiently waiting to see who emerges from this matchup, with the Cotton Bowl looming just over a week away.\n\nContact/Follow us @BuckeyesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Ohio State news, notes, and opinion.

    "fullText": "Texas A&M (11-1, 7-1 SEC) is less than 24 hours away from hosting Miami (10-2) in the first round of the College Football Playoff. After losing to rival Texas on the road almost a month ago, the Aggies have had plenty of time to fix their remaining issues and prepare to face one of the more complete teams in the country on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThroughout the month, the health status of senior running back Le'Veon Moss has been the primary talking point, knowing that the Aggies would have likely finished 12-0 with a chance at an SEC Championship if Moss had not been injured against Florida in late October.\n\nWith an ankle injury, head coach Mike Elko has kept things under wraps for the most part, while confirming on Wednesday that he remains in \"wait-and-see mode\" regarding his star back's status. However, the first official injury report, which was released on Wednesday, designated Moss as \"questionable\" with a 50% chance to play, coupled with linebacker Scooby Williams and safety Bryce Anderson as \"probable\" with a 75% chance to take the field.\n\nOn Thursday night, just minutes after Texas A&M's Volleyball team swept No. 1 Pitt 3-0 to earn its first trip to the National Championship Game, the latest injury report revealed good news for the Aggies, as Williams and Anderson were not included in the injury report, while Moss remains questionable.\n\nGetting both defenders back is great news for Texas A&M's run defense, which has struggled early in games. For what it's worth, a Texas A&M student who reportedly spoke with Le'Veon Moss on Saturday during the senior's graduation ceremony stated, \"Moss is a go!\"\n\nTexas A&M will host Miami on Saturday at 11:00 a.m. with coverage on ABC and ESPN.\n\nThursday's update of the CFP Student-Athlete Availability Report ahead of Saturday's first-round matchup between #7 Texas A&M and #10 Miami: pic.twitter.com/0KszoWObum\n\n— TexAgs (@TexAgs) December 19, 2025\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M LB Scooby Williams, S Bryce Anderson available vs. Miami",

    "fullText": "The field of 64 teams in the 2025 NCAA volleyball tournament is down to the championship with the No. 1 Kentucky Wildcats and No. 3 seed Texas A&M Aggies remaining. They will face off in the first all-SEC national championship game on Sunday, Dec. 21 (3:30 p.m. ET, ABC) at the T-Mobile Center in Kansas City.\n\nTexas A&M is looking to take its best season in program history even further. The Aggies are vying for their first title in their first championship appearance after upsetting No. 1 overall seed Nebraska and No. 1 Pitt in the Elite Eight and Final Four, respectively. Meanwhile, Kentucky is looking to win its second title and first since 2020 after getting past No. 3 Wisconsin in a thrilling five-set semifinal win.\n\nHere's a preview of the national championship, including lineups and X-factors to keep an eye on:\n\nNo. 3 Texas A&M will face off against No. 1 Kentucky in the national championship game on on Sunday, Dec. 21 (3:30 p.m. ET, ABC) at T-Mobile Center in Kansas City.\n\n6 Kassie O'Brien | S 6-1 - Freshman\n\n10 Kennedy Washington | MB 6-0 - Sophomore\n\n11 Molly Berezowitz | DS 5-5 - Junior\n\n12 Molly Tuozzo | L 5-7 - Junior\n\n15 Lizzie Carr | MB 6-6 - Redshirt Junior\n\n17 Brooklyn DeLeye | OH 6-2 - Junior\n\nIt's unusual to list an AVCA First-team All-American as an X-factor, but Brooklyn Deleye's performance will be paramount against the streaking Aggies. Kentucky got off to a slow start in the first set of their Final Four win over No. 3 Wisconsin — suffering their worst deficit in a set since 2018 — due in part to Deleye's early struggles. She hit 15 kills on 50 total attempts, but her dismal .160 hitting percentage marked her third-lowest of the season. The Wildcats and Deleye must come out strong in the national championship and cannot afford to get behind the Aggies.\n\n37 Kyndal Stowers | OH 5-11 - Sophomore\n\n1 Ifenna Cos-Okpalla | MB 6-2 - Senior\n\n2 Addi Applegate | L/DS 5-5 - Freshman\n\n9 Logan Lednicky | OPP 6-3 - Senior\n\n12 Ava Underwood | L/DS 5-7 - Senior\n\n16 Maddie Waak | S 5-10 - Senior\n\nIfenna Cos-Okpalla is a 2025 AVCA First-Team All-American for a reason. The 6-foot-2 senior middle blocker has been an iron wall this postseason. She leads the Aggies with 195 total blocks and 1.70 blocks per set, which ranks third-best in the nation.

    "description": "Arkansas State completes mission of winning season and unlocks a new achievement in Frisco, TX.",
    "fullText": "Arkansas State unlocked a significant achievement Thursday night in Frisco, TX.\n\nThe Red Wolves emerged victorious in the inaugural Xbox Bowl, taking down first-year FBS program Missouri State 34-28 in the first college football game played at the Ford Center inside The Star — the practice facility of the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nImmediately after Master Chief from Halo handled the coin toss, Arkansas State wasted no time in completing a successful mission, pouncing on its competition to manufacture a lead as great as 31-7. Missouri State stared down the red ring of death but didn’t disconnect its controller. The Bears’ instead fought to the finish but failed to recover a late onside kick, watching a successful inaugural season conclude in heartbreaking fashion.\n\nArkansas State relied on the arm of veteran quarterback Jaylen Raynor, whose passing attributes looked maxed out at 99 overall for much of Thursday night. The junior finished 17-of-31 with 288 yards, delivering three touchdowns to three different targets. On the Red Wolves’ opening series, he delivered a strike to a 7-yard touchdown Jaylen Bonelli. He continued his rampage with a 71-yard sideline deep shot to sixth-year senior receiver Corey Rucker — a longtime Arkansas State standout playing his final collegiate game. Then to manufacture a 24-7 halftime lead, the quarterback played pitch and catch with Chauncy Cobb, who caught a 4-yard touchdown set up by one of Raynor’s several successful deep balls.\n\nRucker, who exceeded 100 yards in Arkansas State’s 2024 bowl victory, concluded his college career on a spectacular note. He posted 166 yards and a touchdown on six catches, exceeding 160 for the fifth time in Red Wolves colors. Rucker already held designation as the program’s career leader in receiving yards, but on his lone touchdown, he moved into sole possession of first place on Arkansas State’s all-time receiving touchdowns list, breaking a tie with Omar Bayless.\n\nMissouri State’s seventh-year quarterback Jacob Clark also saw a noble sendoff despite a losing effort, firing for 349 yards and four touchdowns against the Sun Belt opponent. However, the quarterback — who had been sacked more than any other QB in the FBS this year — was upended in the backfield all game long by an Arkansas State defense which generated nine sacks. Missouri State’s offensive line looked like it accidentally set the difficulty to Heisman mode, as Arkansas State defensive linemen Ethan Hassler, Demarcus Hendricks, and Cody Silger all frequented the hit stick to register multiple sacks in a pure domination.\n\nWith that immense pressure, Missouri State’s offense severely lagged, punting on seven of its first eight possessions. Because its lone touchdown over that 8-drive span was a 39-yard completion to Dash Luke, the Bears never snapped the ball inside the Arkansas State 35-yard line until roughly one minute remained in the third quarter. With Luke thriving in the second half behind a 7-reception, 169-yard, 2-touchdown performance, Missouri State’s offense surged late, but the Bears were in too deep of a hole with too time to fully climb out.\n\nMissouri State (7-6, 5-3 CUSA) still finished its first FBS season above .500 — a remarkable accomplishment for the program. Now that the Bears checked off their first box of playing in a bowl game, in 2026 they’ll look to move one step further by managing a bowl victory. Leading the charge will be SMU offensive coordinator Casey Woods, who is slated to accept the Missouri State head coaching position later in the week, as the team transitions to year two.\n\nArkansas State (7-6, 5-3 Sun Belt) wins its second-straight bowl game under head coach Butch Jones. The Red Wolves never won a single bowl until 2012, but now six bowl trophies will reside in their facilities when they return to Jonesboro. With the win, Arkansas State clinched back-to-back winning campaigns for the first time since its fruitful 2011-19 stretch, concluding the 2025 season with a new achievement in the inaugural Xbox Bowl.",

The only exception was the blackout look against Mississippi State earlier this season, which resulted in a 31-9 win over the Bulldogs.\n\nHowever, the Aggies tricked all of us earlier this week after hinting at a potential blackout, which would have been a first for an early 11:00 a.m. kickoff. Still, whatever the Aggies wear isn't going to magically help this team get past the Hurricanes, who will field one of the best defenses in the country, and one of the more electrifying playmakers in freshman wide receiver Malachi Toney.\n\nHead coach Mike Elko is hoping that playing at home three weeks after losing to Texas on the road to end the regular season is the recipe for success, paired with a solid week of practice. The news is that star running back Le'Veon Moss, who has missed the last six games due to an ankle injury, is \"questionable\" to play on Saturday. At the same time, senior linebacker Scooby Williams and safety Bryce Anderson are \"probable\" with 75% chance to take the field.\n\nEither way, Texas A&M's best path to facing Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl is for starting quarterback Marcel Reed to play at an elite level, both in the pocket and with his legs, against a Miami defensive line led by Rueben Bain, who is looking to ruin the Aggies' offensive game plan.\n\nEvery era has led to this. #GigEm | #BTHOmiami pic.twitter.com/3zcz2bRZwp\n\n— Texas A&M Football (@AggieFootball) December 18, 2025\n\nTexas A&M will host Miami on Saturday at 11:00 a.m. with coverage on ABC and ESPN.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M will wear maroon/maroon/white vs. Miami in the CFP",

    "fullText": "The Texas City disaster was an industrial accident that occurred on April 16, 1947, in the port of Texas City, Texas, United States, located in Galveston Bay. It was the deadliest industrial accident in U.S. history and one of history's largest non-nuclear explosions.\n\nThe explosion was triggered by a mid-morning fire on board the French-registered vessel SS Grandcamp (docked at port), which detonated her cargo of about 2,300 tons (about 2,100 metric tons) of ammonium nitrate.[1] This started a chain reaction of fires and explosions aboard other ships and in nearby oil-storage facilities, ultimately killing at least 581 people, including all but one member of Texas City's volunteer fire department.[2]: 100\n\nThe disaster drew the first class action lawsuit against the United States government, on behalf of 8,485 plaintiffs, under the 1946 Federal Tort Claims Act.\n\nThe Port of Texas City is located in a protected harbor inland from Galveston, with relatively straight access to the Gulf of Mexico.[2]: 6  The port expanded greatly during World War II, as many wartime chemical and oil plants were located in or near the city. In 1946, some 4,000 ships loaded or unloaded cargo in the port.[2]: 9  The growth of the town caused a housing shortage, and housing for Black and Hispanic residents was located close to the port.[2]: 10  The nearest neighborhood was only .5 miles (0.80 km) away from the site of the explosion.[2]: 11  Within 1 mile (1.6 km) there were six major chemical or oil companies, nine piers, eleven warehouses, a grain elevator, and many homes.[2]: 12\n\nWhile oil and chemicals had been the major export, the port also began shipping ammonium nitrate in 1945.[2]: 15  The ammonium nitrate, needed either as fertilizer or an explosive, was manufactured in Nebraska and Iowa and shipped to Texas City by rail before being loaded onto ships.[3] The dedicated Texas City Terminal Railway provided final mile service directly to the port.[2]: 11  Export of ammonium nitrate increased significantly in the postwar years as ammunition manufacturing was converted into fertilizer manufacturing, to be sent for export to rebuild war-torn Europe.[2]: 20\n\nSS Grandcamp was a recently re-activated 437-foot-long (133 m) Liberty ship. Originally named SS Benjamin R. Curtis in Los Angeles in 1942, the ship served in the Pacific theater and was mothballed in Philadelphia after the war.[4] In a Cold War gesture, the ship was assigned by the U.S. to the French Line to assist in the rebuilding of France, along with other efforts in Europe. Accordingly, she was captained by a French crew led by Captain Charles de Guillebon. Along with the ammonium nitrate—a very common cargo on the high seas—she was carrying small-arms ammunition, machinery, and bales of sisal twine on the deck.[2]: 19  Her engine was undergoing repairs while docked and thus the ship was inoperable.[2]: 32\n\nAnother ship in the harbor, SS High Flyer, was docked about 600 feet (200 m) away from Grandcamp. The ammonium nitrate aboard the two ships, and fertilizer in an adjacent warehouse, were intended for export to farmers in Europe. Grandcamp had arrived from Houston, where the port authority did not permit the loading of ammonium nitrate.\n\nGrandcamp had a mixed cargo, containing chiefly ammonium nitrate, but also twine, peanuts, tobacco, some small arms ammunition, engineering equipment, and cotton.[2]: 1  The ammonium nitrate was manufactured in a patented process, mixed with clay, petrolatum, rosin and paraffin wax to avoid moisture caking. It was packaged in 100 pounds (45 kg) paper sacks.[2]: 20  Longshoremen reported the bags were warm to the touch before loading.\n\nHigh Flyer held an additional 961 short tons (872 t) of ammonium nitrate[1] and 1,800 short tons (1,600 metric tons) of sulfur.[citation needed]\n\nGrandcamp arrived in port on April 11, 1947, and began loading 2,500 short tons (2,300 t) of fertilizer on April 14, which were to be sent to France.[2]: 19  The storage deck of Grandcamp was divided into five storage holds, with a fuel oil bunker located between Hold 3 and Hold 4. The fertilizer was to be added to Hold 2 and Hold 4. The loading continued until interrupted by rain on the evening of the 15th. Loading was set to continue on the morning of the 16th, with the last 600 short tons (540 t) set to be loaded into the partially full Hold 4.[2]: 19, 35\n\nOn Wednesday, April 16, 1947, around 8 a.m., smoke was spotted in the cargo hold of Grandcamp while it was still moored. Longshoremen used a gallon jug of water and two fire extinguishers, but they had no effect and the cargo hold filled with smoke. The longshoremen were then ordered to leave the hold. At this point, the captain of Grandcamp ordered that no water be used, lest the cargo be ruined. Instead, he ordered all hatches sealed and the hold to be filled with steam in an attempt to smother the fire.[2]: 2  This was unlikely to be effective, as ammonium nitrate is an oxidizer, thus neutralizing the extinguishing properties of steam. The steam may have contributed to the fire by converting the ammonium nitrate to nitrous oxide, while augmenting the already intense heat in the ship's hold.[5] Around 8:30 a.m. the stevedores who were fighting the fire were ordered off the ship, likely because the heat had become too intense and there were concerns that the small arms ammunition could cook off.[2]: 31\n\nWhile the port had fire hydrants, it lacked its own fire engines. A call for outside help was sent at 8:37.[2]: 31  Responding fire departments included the Texas City volunteer fire department and the Republic Oil Refining Company firefighting team.[2]: 2  As crews fought the fire, the hatch on Hold 4 blew off from the pressure of the steam. A column of yellow-orange smoke billowed out, the typical color for nitrogen dioxide fumes.[1] The fire and its unusual-looking smoke attracted a crowd of about 500 spectators (including many children) along the shoreline, who believed they were at a safe distance.[6] Around 9:00, the fire abated slightly, but the steam suppression system was still actively heating Hold 4. Most of the crew had disembarked the ship, and Captain Guillebon was taking a headcount on the pier.[2]: 34\n\nAt 9:12 a.m., the ammonium nitrate reached an explosive threshold and the Grandcamp detonated. The exact cause is unknown, but the likeliest explanation is that the heat of the fire caused the fuel oil bunker adjacent to Hold 4 to split, pouring fuel onto the hot, decomposing fertilizer, creating an impromptu ANFO mixture that was susceptible to detonation.[2]: 35  The Grandcamp was entirely obliterated. The resulting explosion caused utter destruction within 2,000 feet (610 m) and extreme damage throughout the port. The tremendous blast produced a 15 ft (4.6 m) tsunami and a shockwave, levelling nearly 1,000 buildings on land.[2]: 3  The tsunami was responsible for a significant portion of onlooker deaths.[2]: 37\n\nFlying shrapnel resulted in ignition of refineries and chemical tanks along the waterfront. Falling bales of burning twine from Grandcamp's cargo added to the damage, and her anchor was hurled across the city. Two sightseeing airplanes flying nearby were blown out of the sky,[7] while 8 miles (13 km) away, half of the windows in Galveston were shattered.[8] The explosion blew almost 6,350 short tons (5,760 t) of the ship's steel into the air, some at supersonic speed.\n\nThe Monsanto Chemical Company plant adjacent to the slip where Grandcamp was docked suffered the brunt of the first explosion. Of its 574 employees and contractors, 234 were killed, and 200 more were injured. Every man of the Monsanto fire fighting team, which were laying hose reels opposite the Grandcamp, was killed.[2]: 37–38\n\nThe exact damage caused by the first explosion is not fully ascertainable, as the second explosion wreaked further havoc and came before a survey of the damage could be done.[2]: 38\n\nSeven ruptured oil tanks at the Republic Refinery began to burn, letting off thick clouds of black smoke.[2]: 39  Burning sulfur in a dockside warehouse created acrid fumes.[2]: 40\n\nOfficial casualty estimates came to a total of 567, including all the crewmen who remained aboard Grandcamp. All but one member of the 28-man Texas City volunteer fire department were killed in the initial explosion on the docks while fighting the shipboard fire. With fires raging throughout Texas City, first responders from other areas were initially unable to reach the site of the disaster.\n\nStill, 112 people within 500 ft (150 m) of the Grandcamp survived, including many witnesses who would allow for later reconstruction of the events.[2]: 37–38\n\nThe first explosion had set Highflyer free from its moorings, and it had drifted across the harbor, coming to rest against SS Wilson B. Keene. Her crew stayed aboard for an hour before the smoke of the burning oil and sulfur forced them to leave. In the afternoon, two men boarded Highflyer searching for injured crewmembers. They noted that her cargo was ablaze and reported it to someone on the harborfront. This message seems to have gone unheeded for several hours until it was realized that this indicated a serious problem. Only around 11 p.m. did tugboats attempt to pull Highflyer away from the docks. Despite having cut her anchor, they were unable to move her. They fled the area around 1 a.m. the next day (April 17). Ten minutes later, at 1:10 a.m., Highflyer exploded, killing two more people. According to witnesses, the explosion was more powerful than that of Grandcamp. Casualties were light since the docks had already been evacuated, but the second explosion exacerbated the damage to nearby ships and buildings. The blast destroyed the nearby Wilson B. Keene. The steel frame of Highflyer had been heated until glowing, and these chunks rained down upon Texas City setting mass fires.[2]: 4–5, 40–41  One of the propellers was blown off and subsequently found nearly a mile inland. It is now in a memorial park near the anchor of Grandcamp.\n\nThe Texas City disaster is generally considered the worst industrial accident in U.S. history. Witnesses compared the scene to the fairly recent images of the 1943 air raid on Bari and the much larger devastation after an atomic bomb was dropped at Nagasaki.\n\nOf the dead, 405 were identified and 63 have never been identified. The latter remains were placed in a memorial cemetery in the north part of Texas City near Moses Lake. An additional 113 people were classified as missing, for no identifiable parts were ever found. This figure includes firefighters who were aboard Grandcamp when she exploded. There is some speculation that there were hundreds more killed but uncounted, including visiting seamen, undocumented laborers and their families, and an untold number of travelers. More than 800 people were left orphaned or widowed.[2]: 6  However, there were also some survivors among people as close as 70 feet (21 m) from the dock. The victims' bodies quickly filled the local morgue. Several bodies were laid out in the local high school's gymnasium for identification by family or friends.\n\nMore than 5,000 people were injured, with 1,784 admitted to 21 area hospitals. More than 500 homes were destroyed and hundreds damaged, leaving 2,000 homeless. The seaport was destroyed, and many businesses were flattened or burned. Over 1,100 vehicles were damaged and 362 freight cars were obliterated; the property damage was estimated at $100 million[3] (equivalent to $1,100,000,000 in 2024). This number may not encompass the full scope of damage: a further $500 million of oil products burned (equivalent to $5,499,000,000 in 2024).\n\nA 2-short-ton (1.8-metric-ton) anchor of Grandcamp was hurled 1.62 miles (2.61 km) and found in a 10-foot (3 m) crater. It was installed at a memorial park. The other main 5-short-ton (4.5-metric-ton) anchor was hurled 1⁄2 mile (800 m) to the entrance of the Texas City Dike. It rests on a \"Texas-shaped\" memorial at the entrance. Burning wreckage ignited everything within miles, including dozens of oil and chemical tanks. The nearby city of Galveston was covered with an oily fog that left deposits over every exposed outdoor surface.\n\nSome of the deaths and damage in Texas City were due to the destruction and subsequent burning of several chemical plants (including Monsanto and Union Carbide), oil storage, and other facilities near the explosions. Twenty-seven of the twenty-eight members of Texas City's volunteer fire department and three of four members of the Texas City Heights Volunteer Fire Department who were on the docks near the burning ship were killed. One firefighter, Fred Dowdy, who had not responded to the initial call, coordinated other firefighters arriving from communities up to 60 miles (100 km) away. Alvin Fussell, sole survivor of the Heights Volunteer firefighters, was driving to work in Alvin when he heard of the fire on the radio. Eventually 200 firefighters arrived from as far away as Los Angeles. Fires resulting from the cataclysmic events were still burning a week after the disaster, and the process of body recovery took nearly a month. All four fire engines of Texas City were twisted and burned husks.\n\nThe cause of the initial fire on board Grandcamp was never determined. It may have been started by a cigarette discarded the previous day, meaning the ship's cargo had been smoldering throughout the night when the fire was discovered on the morning of the explosion.[1] Historian Hugh Stephens later identified human error as the cause, and cites numerous reasons as to why a minor fire became such a severe incident.[2]: 6\n\nStephens identifies as root causes the expansion of the port, the proximity of dangerous port operations to the rest of Texas City, a lack of community awareness of the danger posed by chemical hazards, and a lack of safety preparation.\n\nSmoking was commonplace at the time. While officially prohibited at the port, such prohibitions were not enforced and smoking was widespread.[2]: 28–29\n\nStephens notes that in interviews and written accounts, few residents of Texas City seemed to understand the danger of the port, as exemplified by the large crowd that assembled to watch the Grandcamp burn. Stephens suggests that in an era before disasters like Bhopal (1984), or Superfund legislation (1986), the sense of danger from chemicals was amorphous. \"Before the accident, Texas City's citizens felt secure because such a disaster had never happened and they could therefore assume it never would.\"[2]: 13  Stephens also points out that Texas City was a boomtown in a time when the rest of the country was still recovering from the Great Depression, in which most of the city owed its prosperity to the oil and chemical industry, which may have further led to lax attitudes.[2]: 14\n\nThe danger of ammonium nitrate may not have been well known at the time. While Army manuals classified it as a high explosive, general belief (and even guidance from the Department of Agriculture) held that fertilizer was not dangerous under typical conditions.[2]: 21–22  However, the danger was not unknown. The Port of Houston had forbidden the loading of fertilizer in 1946.[2]: 24\n\nIn the months before the disaster, local Catholic priest William F. Roach remarked on the concerning industrial conditions by stating \"I feel like I’m sitting on a keg of dynamite.\"[9]\n\nNeither the Port of Texas City, the Texas City Terminal Railway, the City itself, nor any of the oil refineries, had a disaster preparedness plan—which even at the time was regarded as inadequate.[2]: 13–14  The Port itself had no Port authority that could regulate both land and sea operations. Thus, safety was fragmented between companies and between land and sea. The end of military supervision at the end of the war also played a role. Safety authority should have transferred from the military back to the United States Coast Guard, but the Coast Guard failed to take preventative actions and safety instead returned to the hands of private parties.[2]: 16–17  Texas City also failed to police or regulate the dock; such matters were left to security hired by the Terminal Railway.[2]: 27\n\nThe disaster received national media attention, with offers of assistance coming from around the country. Several funds were established to handle donations, particularly the Texas City Relief Fund, created by the city's mayor Curtis Trahan.[2]: 104–105  One of the largest fundraising efforts for the city and the victims of the disaster was organized by Sam Maceo, one of the two brothers who ran organized crime in Galveston at the time. Maceo organized a large-scale benefit on the island, featuring entertainers including Phil Harris, Frank Sinatra, and Ann Sheridan.[2]: 104–105 [10] In the end, the Texas City Relief Fund raised more than $1 million ($15 million in today's terms). Payouts for fire insurance claims reached nearly $4 million ($55.7 million in today's terms).[2]: 104–105\n\nWithin days of the disaster, major companies that had lost facilities in the explosions announced plans to rebuild in Texas City and in some cases to expand their operations. Some companies implemented policies of retaining all of the hourly workers who had previously worked at destroyed facilities with plans to use them in the rebuilding. Cost estimates of the industrial reconstruction were estimated at approximately $100 million ($1.41 billion adjusted for inflation).[2]: 104–105\n\n\"Commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the explosion [...], just as the Phoenix bird symbolizes resurrection from the ashes of despair, the 'Phoenix Fountain' epitomizes courage and the triumph of the human spirit. [...] Chewelah, Washington Artist David Govedare was commissioned by Mayor Charles T. Doyle [...] [to] produce this twelve foot sculpture from half inch cor-ten steel. Architect Joseph Allen Hoover and City Engineer James McWhorter designed the fountain built by Texas City's Public Works Department.\"[11]\n\nMany of the legal cases seeking compensation were combined into Elizabeth Dalehite, et al. v. United States, under the recently enacted Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). On April 13, 1950, the district court found the United States government responsible for a litany of negligent acts of omission and commission by 168 named agencies and their representatives, in the manufacture, packaging, and labeling of ammonium nitrate. This was further compounded by errors in transport, storage, loading, fire prevention, and fire suppression, all of which led to the explosions and the subsequent carnage.\n\nOn June 10, 1952, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned this decision, finding that the United States maintained the right to exercise its own \"discretion\" in vital national matters. The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed that decision (346 U.S. 15, June 8, 1953), in a 4-to-3 opinion, noting that the district court had no jurisdiction under the federal statute to find the government liable for \"negligent planning decisions\" which were properly delegated to various departments and agencies. In short, the FTCA clearly exempts \"failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty\", and the court found that all of the alleged acts in this case were discretionary in nature.[12]\n\nIn its dissent, the three justices argued that, under the FTCA, \"Congress has defined the tort liability of the government as analogous to that of a private person\", i.e., when carrying out duties unrelated to governing. In this case, \"a policy adopted in the exercise of an immune discretion was carried out carelessly by those in charge of detail\", and that a private person would certainly be held liable for such acts. A private person is held to a higher standard of care when carrying out \"inherently dangerous\" acts such as transportation and storage of explosives.\n\nAccording to Melvin Belli in his book Ready for the Plaintiff! (1965), Congress acted to provide some compensation after the courts refused to do so.[13] The Dalehite decision was eventually \"appealed\" to Congress, where relief was granted by means of legislation (Public Law 378, 69 Stat. 707 (1955)).[14] When the last claim had been processed in 1957, 1,394 awards totaling nearly $17 million had been made.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe College Football Playoff will feature plenty of great future NFL talent with the 12 teams making the field. While it might not be surprising Ohio State's loaded team dominates the pro prospects, 18 of Sporting News' 32 first-round projections in all are tied to CFP action.\n\nThe Buckeyes lead with five such picks, with Georgia, Oregon, Texas A&M, Alabama and Miami also in line to have multiple selections on Day 1. Indiana, Oklahoma and Texas Tech get on the board, too. That's incredible representation from three-fourths of the CFP teams, which also account for all three QBs and four of the first five overall picks.\n\nHere is the Sporting News' latest NFL Mock Draft ahead of the 2025 College Football playoff.\n\nMORE: Bills, 49ers rise as Packers fade in latest SN Power Rankings\n\n(No. 1-18 order courtesy of Tankathon; No. 19-32 from Week 16 playoff picture)\n\nArvell Reese, LB, Ohio State (6-4, 243 pounds)\n\nThe Giants, if they stay at No. 1 overall and don't trade out of this pick for a team wanting a quarterback, should consider taking Reese as an all-around force to fix a lot of their defensive issues away from a rather productive pass rush.\n\nFernando Mendoza, QB, Indiana (6-5, 225 pounds)\n\nThe Raiders can't be happy with their quarterback situation post-Derek Carr, with Geno Smith and Kenny Pickett screaming that they need to go after a true, strong, accurate franchise passer solution. Mendoza looks the part with his arm and intangibles, two things that should appeal to the influence of Tom Brady.\n\nMORE: How Fernando Mendoza won the 2025 Heisman over Diego Pavia, Jeremiyah Love, Julian Sayin\n\nRueben Bain Jr., EDGE, Miami (6-3, 275 pounds)\n\nThe Titans also don't need a QB after taking Cam Ward No. 1 overall last year, but they can go back to the Hurricanes program to get the game-changing pass-rusher they desperately need for their latest defensive reboot.\n\nJordyn Tyson, WR, Arizona State (6-2, 200 pounds)\n\nThe Browns need to stop messing around at wide receiver and give either Shedeur Sanders or a different starting quarterback a true go-to all over the field, both in the slot and outside, in Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jaxon Smith-Njigba vein, only lacking the hyphen.\n\nDante Moore, QB, Oregon (6-3, 206 pounds)\n\nMoore has the leadership and intangibles to handle being the next shot at a franchise QB in New York as well as the savvy and strong arm. They also need to get a real long-term option after the Justin Fields flop.\n\nTroy Wayrynen/USA TODAY Network\n\nJeremiyah Love, RB, Notre Dame (6-0, 214 pounds)\n\nThe Cardinals saw the breakdown early of pending free agent James Conner and have had an unhealthy mess of a committee trying to replace him. This may seem like a luxury pick for a team that has a lot of needs, but they can get some tackle help later and Love can be a game-changer for restoring balance and expanding the explosiveness.\n\nMakai Lemon, WR, USC (5-11, 195 pounds)\n\nThe Saints, should they stick with Tyler Shough at QB, need to give him more weapons after depleting the receiving crops beyond Chris Olave. Kellen Moore can have some visions of Lemon being the DeVonta Smith to Olave's A.J. Brown should Shough show big improvement.\n\nMORE: Sporting News' expert predictions for 2025 College Football Playoff\n\nCaleb Downs, S, Ohio State (6-0, 205 pounds)\n\nThe Commanders need to get younger and more impactful in their defense after things fell apart in their secondary and around Bobby Wagner at linebacker. Downs is a terrific do-everything hybrid who would be set up to make a lot of big plays in Dan Quinn's scheme.\n\nPeter Woods, DT, Clemson (6-3, 315 pounds)\n\nThe Bengals need to keep beefing up their defensive line to pull out of being atrocious against the run and it doesn't hurt to have some of Woods' inside pass-rush juice to support their end rotation.\n\nJermod McCoy, CB, Tennessee (6-0, 193 pounds)\n\nThe Rams know that cornerback coverage is their biggest weakness on an otherwise loaded roster, with some retooling needed. They keep up the strong defensive pick momentum with the nice-sized, tough McCoy.\n\nFrancis Mauigoa, OT, Miami (6-6, 315 pounds)\n\nThe Dolphins need to get more offensive line help for wherever they go at QB and they can stay in town to get a long-term all-around rock in Mauigoa.\n\nKenyon Sadiq, TE, Oregon (6-3, 245 pounds)\n\nThe Chiefs need to be feeling the imminence of Travis Kelce's retirement and can step right into drafting his dynamic go-to receiver replacement to boost Patrick Mahomes again once he returns from his torn ACL.\n\nMORE: Why it's not time to announce the Chiefs dynasty over yet\n\nMansoor Delane, CB, LSU (6-0, 190 pounds)\n\nThe Vikings will need to keep working on their secondary with some contract issues ahead and Delane is not that far off in battling McCoy for the status as the best corner in this class.\n\nDavid Bailey, EDGE, Texas Tech (6-3, 250 pounds)\n\nThe Cowboys will go to work on replacing Micah Parsons' pass rush production with this Lubbock chess piece who has all the moves to get to the quarterback as well as unique dropback coverage ability for the position.\n\nMORE: Full list of stadiums hosting 2025 College Football Playoff games\n\nKeldric Faulk, EDGE, Auburn (6-6, 285 pounds)\n\nThe Ravens should love this complete outside linebacker option who can provide power vs. the run as well as needed pass-rush juice.\n\nSonny Styles, LB, Ohio State (6-4, 243 pounds)\n\nThe Panthers have been feeling the void at linebacker for a while after it was once a strength and GM Dan Morgan should have intrigue to go for his former position with Styles, a versatile talent who makes a lot of plays everywhere along with Reese.\n\nCashius Howell, EDGE, Texas A&M (6-2, 248 pounds)\n\nHowell can give the Lions the needed strong complementary pass rusher for Aidan Hutchinson to relieve their secondary coverage a lot more next season.\n\nAvieon Terrell, CB, Clemson (5-11, 180 pounds)\n\nThe Jets, after going QB with Moore earlier in this mock, can get their Sauce Gardner replacement with the pick acquired in that trade with Terrell, brother of Falcons star A.J.\n\nMORE: Latest news on QBs entering NCAA transfer portal\n\nSpencer Fano, OT, Utah (6-6, 302 pounds)\n\nThe Texans have gotten surprising returns from rookie Aireontay Ersery and the rest of their rebuilt line but should be in the market to boost pass protection and run blocking at either right tackle or guard with Fano.\n\nT.J. Parker, EDGE, Clemson (6-3, 265 pounds)\n\nThe Cowboys shouldn't mind doubling up on pass-rush help here with Parker and Bailey, as Parker can provide more traditional burst and finishing moves from defensive end to help Quinnen Williams in Matt Eberflus' front four.\n\nCarnell Tate, WR, Ohio State (6-3, 195 pounds)\n\nThe 49ers seem ready to cut ties with injured Brandon Aiyuk, which means they will need to find a dynamic speedy big target for Brock Purdy to better take advantage of his ace deep passing. Tate would be a natural fit with George Kittle and Jauan Jennings downfield.\n\nMORE: Ranking the 25 Heisman Trophy winners since 2000\n\nKayden McDonald, DT, Ohio State (6-3, 326 pounds)\n\nThe Bills have been terrible against the run and McDonald is a natural and physically overwhelming run-stopper for the Buckeyes, shooting up boards with his dominant play fron the regular season.\n\nCaleb Banks, DT, Florida (6-6, 330 pounds)\n\nThe Chargers also could bolster their interior to help their front seven in multiple ways and Banks has the right kind of power and pop for Jesse Minter.\n\nBrandon Cisse, CB, South Carolina (6-0, 190 pounds)\n\nThe Seahawks didn't trade pending free agent Riq Woolen and will need to find their strong replacement outside to support Devon Witherpoon. Cissee can be seamless in the schme of Mike Macdonald.\n\nMORE: Picks against the spread for all 35 bowl games\n\nR Mason Thomas, EDGE, Oklahoma (6-2, 249 pounds)\n\nThe Buccaneers should covet this explosive pass-rusher built to thrive in Todd Bowles' scheme and help restore their old strength on the second level.\n\nTy Simpson, QB, Alabama (6-2, 208 pounds)s\n\nThe Steelers should be in the market for a starting QB early if Aaron Rodgers retires and Simpson's brand of pocket passing would provide plenty of promise.\n\nOlaivavega Ioane, G, Penn State (6-4, 330 pounds)\n\nThe Eagles have had issues at right guard this season and Ioane would be the easy upgrade coming from State College to Philly. sliding over from his left side position in college to start right away and upgrade over Tyler Steen.\n\nCaleb Lomu, OT, Utah (6-6, 304 pounds)\n\nThe Browns need to rebuild their offensive line right up there with getting more reliable receivers and Lomu would be a good initial building block, going not long after teammate Fano.\n\nChristen Miller, DT, Georgia (6-3, 305 pounds)\n\nThe Bears need to work on their interior for Dennis Allen's front and Miller would be ideal to help them with their own run-stopping problems.\n\nKC Concepcion, WR, Texas A&M (5-11, 190 pounds)\n\nThe Patriots should love what this dynamic slot can do as the ideal fit in Josh McDaniels' offense to make big plays in the open field after the catch and upgrade over Pop Douglas and other complements to Stefon Diggs.\n\nMORE: Updated list of every college coaching change for 2026\n\nKadyn Proctor, OT, Alabama (6-7, 366 pounds)\n\nThe Rams can again think more about the near future with this second first-rounder with Proctor looking solid as their future long-term tackle on either the right or left side.\n\nC.J. Allen, LB, Georgia (6-1, 235 pounds)\n\nThe Broncos need to cover more ground defensively on the second level and Allen would provide that typical Bulldogs athlete who can get around well vs. run and in coverage.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer Texas Longhorns quarterback and current Miami Dolphins signal-caller Quinn Ewers has an opportunity to end a 21-year drought in Week 16.\n\nOn Wednesday, it was reported that the Dolphins are benching Tua Tagovailoa and are promoting Ewers to the starting job over fellow backup Zach Wilson, even though Wilson has been serving as the QB2 all season.\n\nThe move to promote Ewers over Wilson makes sense, as the Dolphins need to see what they have in the rookie and the book is already written on Wilson.\n\nEwers, who was drafted in the seventh round of the 2025 NFL draft by Miami, will be making his second NFL appearance but his first career start in Week 16. Ewers came into a game earlier this season and completed 5-of-8 passes for 53 yards.\n\nWhen Ewers takes the field on Sunday, he'll have an opportunity to become the first former Texas quarterback to win his first NFL start since Chris Simms did it 2004 with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, according to ESPN Insights.\n\nA third-round pick of the Bucs in 2003, Simms made his first career start in 2004 in a game that saw the Bucs emerge victorious, 20-17.\n\nSimms, who was replacing Brad Johnson, threw just eight passes in that game, completing five for 68 yards. He didn't finish the game, though, as veteran quarterback Brian Griese replaced him in the second quarter.\n\nSince Simms' win in his first start in 2004, when Ewers was just one year old, other Texas quarterbacks who have failed to accomplish that feat include Vince Young (Tennessee Titans, 2005), Colt McCoy (Cleveland Browns, 2010) and Sam Ehlinger (Indianapolis Colts, 2022).\n\nThis is obviously a golden opportunity for Ewers, who now has a chance to show the Dolphins he could be \"the guy\" for the future.\n\nThe deck is certainly stacked against Ewers as a seventh-round pick, but at least he has a chance.\n\nWhat Patrick Mahomes tearing 2 ligaments means for recovery timeline\n\nMike McDaniel gives bizarre answer for lack of late-game urgency\n\nMatt Prater injury update leaves Bills in precarious spot at kicker\n\nMicah Parsons' dad weighs in on Packers superstar's return timeline\n\nJaguars offense in midst of streak not seen in NFL this season",

Setting records like that doesn't happen by chance, however. It took hours of hard work rebuilding a culture of success in Bryan-College Station, Texas, featuring a product that every Aggie fan could be proud of. When third-year head coach Jamie Morrison was hired, he wanted to change the nation's perception of Texas A&M volleyball.\n\nAfter the historic victory over Nebraska that sent the Maroon and White to the Final Four, that mission has been accomplished. There is still plenty of volleyball to play, as the Aggies look to make more history against a dominant Pitt squad on Thursday night.\n\nYes, you read that right. 1.2 MILLION people saw @AggieVolleyball serve Nebraska it's first loss of the season. pic.twitter.com/G5MlMgWde6\n\n— Texas A&M Athletics (@12thMan) December 17, 2025\n\nWhile Coach Morrison has played an integral role in building the program into a nationally-recognized powerhouse on the rise, it wouldn't be possible without the plethora of talented athletes who have dedicated themselves to shaping the culture. The Aggies have secured a school record of 27 wins to this point, while also having four AVCA All-Americans, including a first-team All-American for the first time since 2006.\n\nIfenna Cos-Okpalla was named a first-team All-American, Kyndal Stowers and Logan Lednicky rounded out the Aggies' second-team All-Americans and Maddie Waak was named a third-team selection. That's a massive testament to the performances from the Texas A&M stars, but also to Morrison's ability to develop talent into some of the best college volleyball players in the country.\n\nTexas A&M is slated to play Pitt in the Final Four from Kansas City, Missouri, on Thursday, Dec. 17, at 5:30 p.m. CT.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Dylan on X: @dylanmflippo.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M volleyball recorded impressive viewership in Elite Eight win",

    "fullText": "The San Antonio-to-Austin mega-metro is home to numerous small towns that are quietly evolving into retirement hubs and appealing destinations for young, growing families. Some of these towns are located along Interstate 10 in the Texas Hill Country and are growing with people looking for a slower pace of life while still having access to the amenities of nearby big cities.\n\nKerrville, Texas, is one of those places. It's a charming, historic city with a potentially undervalued real estate market, according to FinanceBuzz. The small town is undergoing a significant recovery effort following the recent Guadalupe River floods, and some landowners and some homeowners are struggling to rebuild after the tragedy.\n\nHowever, with the reopening of a major park and a $375,000 investment from Texas NBA teams into another, as reported by the San Antonio Express-News, along with new developments coming to town and a major initiative to enhance lifestyle upgrades that were finalized just before the flood, the small town could potentially emerge stronger after the recovery.\n\nHere's what to know about Kerrville:\n\nKerrville is known for its location along the Guadalupe River and its festivals, culture and history, but it is also the birthplace of major Texas brands like H-E-B and James Avery.\n\nIn 2015, Phoenix Marketing International, a Los Angeles-based advertising and brand research firm, found that Kerrville is home to the second largest population of millionaires per capita in Texas, second only to Fredericksburg.\n\nIt's also home to a private Presbyterian college, Schreiner University. Equally as important, it hosts the annual Kerrville Folk Festival, a giant folk music festival, and a Renaissance Festival each year.\n\nAccording to the city's website, the city is also known for its breathtaking views, scenic parks and outdoor recreational activities. The riverfront town apparently has so many outdoor options that it \"has long been recognized as one of the healthiest areas of Texas, offering an active lifestyle with many fun and exciting things to do.\"\n\nThe city is just 65 miles northwest, or a one-hour drive from downtown San Antonio.\n\nAccording to Niche.com, Kerrville ISD boasts an overall A- rating, thanks to its academics, teachers, college prep, and administration teams. The school district is more than 100 years old and educates more than 4,950 students across six traditional campuses, one early childhood center, and an alternative academic high school. Per the school district, it has achieved recognition for its 100% graduation rate and is known for its 12 career and technology education pathways.\n\nThe city's population is 24,278 as of 2020 U.S. Census data.\n\nAccording to 2025 data from Zillow, Kerrville's median sale price was $361,377 on October 31, 2025. Typical home values are priced at $346,941, which is down 3.2% over the past year.\n\nAccording to World Population Review, the median household income in Kerrville is $59,431. The local poverty rate is 11.81%.\n\nAccording to Zillow, the average rent in Kerrville is $1,800, which is 10% lower than the national average.\n\nThe average rent for a one-bedroom apartment is $1,125 per month. For a two-bedroom apartment, the average rent is $1,700 per month. A three-bedroom apartment has an average rent of $2,000 per month. The average rent for a four-bedroom apartment is $2,995 per month. Rent for a home can range from less than $500 to $5,000, with the average cost being $1,800.\n\nAccording to the website FindEnergy, the average monthly residential power bill for a Kerrville Public Utility Board customer is $106.54 per month. The average residential electricity rates are 43.83% lower per kilowatt than the average state rate.\n\nAccording to TripAdvisor, the best places to eat in Kerrville are Billy Gene's Restaurant, Rails A Cafe at the Depot, Rio Ranch Cafe, The Lakehouse Restaurant, and The Ridge Marketplace - Cafe at the Ridge. Locals also love Mary's Tacos, which is set for a major transformation in 2026.\n\nAustin is located 101 miles east of Kerrville via U.S. 290, which is known as the Texas Wine Trail. The two-hour drive will have you traveling through some of  Texas' tiniest and tourist-friendly towns like Johnson City, Fredericksburg and Stonewall, just to name a few.\n\nThis article originally published at Everything to know before visiting this fast-growing Texas riverfront town.",

We appreciate law enforcement for their swift action and will continue cooperating with them as they investigate.”\n\nThe Biloxi Police Department said it does not believe any other stores have been targeted.\n\nIf customers purchase a product that has been tampered with, they should immediately throw it out and visit their local Walmart for a full refund, the company said.",

    "description": "AG Ken Paxton accused Sony, Samsung, LG, Hisense and TCL of \"spying on Texans.\"",
    "fullText": "Behold: Ken Paxton will now demonstrate that broken clocks are indeed right twice a day. The Texas Attorney General is notorious for, well, a very long list of reasons. But in this case, he at least appears to be doing consumers a solid: He sued five television companies for using ad-targeting spyware on their TVs.\n\nTexas sued Sony, Samsung, LG, Hisense and TCL for allegedly recording what viewers watch without their consent. The predatory technology, Automated Content Recognition (ACR), identifies the content being played on a device by matching short content fingerprints to a database.\n\nACR is essentially a Shazam for video. Except in this case, its sole purpose is to target your viewing habits to help line advertisers' pockets. \"This software can capture screenshots of a user's television display every 500 milliseconds, monitor viewing activity in real time and transmit that information back to the company without the user's knowledge or consent,\" Paxton's press release says.\n\nAn LG Ad Solutions website boasts how ACR helps advertisers \"target by content viewership, including show, network, app, service or genre.\" Since it works with anything running on the device, it can identify purchases and subscriptions, track gamers' habits and pinpoint users by region, city or zip code.\n\nThere should be a setting on your TV to turn it off. But, as Texas' lawsuit against LG notes, TV software often \"deceptively guides consumers to activate ACR and buries any explanation of what that means in dense legal jargon that few will read or understand.\"\n\nPaxton's press release emphasized Hisense and TCL's home base of China. \"These Chinese ties pose serious concerns about consumer data harvesting and are exacerbated by China's National Security Law, which gives its government the capability to get its hands on US consumer data,\" the statement reads.",

    "description": "I moved into an RV and lived on the road for two years after losing my dog. Eventually, I landed in Galveston, Texas, and found my perfect home.",
    "fullText": "In 2023, I lost my soul dog, Chubbs. He had been with me for 14 years through every apartment, every move, and even a cross-country relocation from Texas to New York.\n\nWhen he passed, it felt like someone had pulled the anchor from my life. I didn't just lose my dog; I lost my sense of safety and the steady presence that had guided every chapter of my adult life. The grief felt overwhelming.\n\nIn the quiet that followed, my husband and I started asking hard questions about what \"home\" really meant. We'd both spent years chasing careers, paying rent in cities that never felt permanent.\n\nSo, we did something radical: We sold almost everything we owned, from our furniture to our books, and bought an RV.\n\nWe had no intention of settling down anywhere; life on the road was our near and distant future plan.\n\nThose first months on the road were a crash course in patience and perspective.\n\nEvery day, we woke up to the hum of nature and winding highways. We worked remotely wherever we parked, building a life that could fit inside a 32-foot space.\n\nWe spent a few peaceful months in North Carolina, surrounded by trees and cool air, and almost stayed. In Pennsylvania and Kentucky, we discovered unexpected beauty in small towns and winding back roads.\n\nArizona and New Mexico, though, were a little tougher — we found them a bit too dry and stark, and longed for the ocean and more greenery. Each place taught us its own lesson about what felt like home and what didn't.\n\nLife on the road wasn't always easy, but it gave me the quiet I needed to heal after losing Chubbs.\n\nThe more miles we drove, though, the clearer it became that I didn't just want to keep moving. I wanted to build a life that felt full again, something steady and rooted that my dog would have loved, too.\n\nEventually, the road led us to Galveston, a Texas Gulf Coast island that had always held a piece of my heart.\n\nGrowing up in Texas, my family had vacationed here often, and I was instantly hit with nostalgia and happy memories. I felt right at home with the salty air, laid-back island vibe, and Historic Strand District, a commercial area with many of Galveston's oldest buildings.\n\nAt first, it was just another stop; we thought we'd stay for a few weeks. However, we were wrong.\n\nThe island's mix of old-world charm and creative energy is unlike anywhere else in Texas. There's art on every corner, history in every building, and a deep sense of community that instantly made us feel like family.\n\nAfter years of constant motion, we finally felt rooted.\n\nSettling in Galveston reignited something I hadn't realized I had lost: creative connection.\n\nI began writing again and eventually joined a local publication focused on the arts, where I help tell the stories of the island's artists, musicians, and makers.\n\nNow, my work feels personal and purposeful, even though it looks less like the corporate life I led in the past.\n\nI've met so many people who also came to Galveston after a big life change or loss, and found peace in the island's slower rhythm.\n\nThis city has a way of bringing people together, whether through a shared love of art, a late open-mic jam, or a quick chat over coffee at one of the local hot spots.\n\nIn my experience, the people in Galveston are warm and welcoming. Whenever I go to a grocery store or even for a walk on the Seawall, I find myself in conversation with a few BOIs (Born on the Island) or IBCs (Islander By Choice), all curious about my travels.\n\nWhen Chubbs died, I lost my sense of home. For two years, every place we parked the RV felt temporary, a stopover rather than a destination.\n\nI kept hoping that somewhere along the way, the road itself would heal me, but I learned that grief doesn't disappear when you keep moving. It follows you until you stop for long enough to face it.\n\nGalveston was the first place that made me want to stay.\n\nThe rhythm of the waves reminded me of those quiet RV mornings when the world felt still, but here, there was something more: people, community, connection. The same serenity I'd found on the road existed here, just grounded by roots instead of wheels.\n\nAfter years of living everywhere and nowhere, planting roots feels both strange and sacred. Some mornings I still expect to pack up and go, but then I'll catch the smell of salt in the air or head to my favorite coffee spot, and I remember why we stayed.\n\nThe island may not be where I thought I'd end up, but in Galveston, I found what I'd actually been chasing all along: a place that feels like home.",

    "fullText": "Arch Manning makes final decision on returning to Texas in 2026 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTexas quarterback Arch Manning will return to school and play for the Longhorns in 2026, ending months of speculation about whether he would declare for the 2026 NFL draft following his first season as a starter.\n\nESPN's Dave Wilson reported on Monday night that Manning’s father, Cooper Manning, confirmed the decision. “Arch is playing football at Texas next year,” he said.\n\nTexas officials also told ESPN the program fully expected Manning to return, even though the redshirt sophomore was eligible to enter the draft. Manning’s decision gives the Longhorns a boost at the game’s most important position as they look to build on a late-season surge.\n\nDuring a media event in Orlando, Florida, ahead of the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl against Michigan on Dec. 31, Texas coach Steve Sarkisian said another year of college football would benefit Manning.\n\n“He’s a young man who’s gotten better as the season’s gone on, and not only physically, but mentally, maturity-wise,” Sarkisian said. “I would think he’s going to want another year of that growth to put himself in position for hopefully a long career in the NFL.”\n\nSarkisian added that Texas’ unfinished goals likely factored into the decision.\n\n“We left some meat on the bone with an opportunity to be SEC champs, national champs,” Sarkisian said.\n\nManning played his best football down the stretch as Texas went 6-1 late in the season and pushed for the College Football Playoff. Entering the bowl game, he has completed 227 of 370 passes for 2,942 yards, 24 touchdowns and seven interceptions, with only two picks over the final seven games.

    "description": "Jansen will help shore up Texas' catching situation; Alexander brings left-handed pitching element to Rangers' staff.",
    "fullText": "Entering the 2026 MLB season, the Texas Rangers knew that they needed some help at the catcher's position. The club non-tendered Jonah Heim after the season ended, so Texas needed to do something.\n\nTherefore, the Rangers have picked up Danny Jansen, who played last season for the Tampa Bay Rays and Milwaukee Brewers. The ballclub also added left-handed pitcher Tyler Alexander to their pitching staff. Besides Alexander, there's been some reporting from MLB.com that Texas might be close to a deal with Alexis Díaz.\n\nJansen agreed to a two-year contract for a reported $14.5 million with an option for 2027. Alexander is joining Texas on a one-year deal.\n\nJansen's defense is something that the Rangers really must have liked a lot. Last season, Jansen had 14 blocks above average. Jansen, though, has spent time during his MLB career on the injured list. In 2025, though, he managed to appear in 98 games, hitting .215 with a .720 OPS.\n\nHe avoided going on the injured list last season, too. When hitting, Jansen is known for pulling the ball and putting it in the air. The Rangers hope that Jansen continues that trend next season, too.\n\nWe’ve signed C Danny Jansen to a two-year contract with a mutual option for 2028 and LHP Tyler Alexander to a one-year contract. pic.twitter.com/CjvnRpvioo\n\n— Texas Rangers (@Rangers) December 16, 2025\n\nAlexander will be a strong addition to the Rangers' bullpen. In seven MLB seasons, Alexander has a 4.63 ERA while playing for four MLB clubs. This also is a coming home of sorts for Alexander, who played high school ball at Southlake Carroll in Southlake, Texas, which is just miles away from Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas.\n\nAlexander played his college ball at TCU in Fort Worth, so that put him in close proximity to go and see Rangers games while he was in college.\n\nAs for Díaz, he played for three teams last season and put together a not-so-impressive 8.15 ERA. That happened on the heels of a pretty outstanding 2023, when Díaz was an All-Star, and posted a 3.99 ERA in 2024.\n\nTexas set a foundation for its bullpen last season. With Alexander and, hopefully, Díaz coming on board, that just adds some additional arms that Rangers manager Skip Schumaker can look at to bring in as needed.\n\nWhile at the Winter Meetings last week in Orlando, Fla., Rangers general manager Ross Fenstermaker talked about what type of pitching philosophy the team is taking at this time.\n\n\"Last year, we wanted to get back to dominating the strike zone, so we targeted pitchers with a historical track record of throwing strikes and attacking the strike zone,\" Fenstermaker said. \"I think it's going to be much of the same going forward. But that is kind of a fundamental truth and a through point for us in terms of our pitching philosophy.\"\n\nLook for these additions to the Rangers' roster to come through for Schumaker, Fenstermaker, and Rangers president of baseball operations Chris Young in 2026.\n\nRemember to join our RANGERS on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE!

All my brothers did sports. So I’ve been doing them since third grade.”\n\nShe’s played numerous sports throughout the years, but truly found her stride in cross country, even setting a school record her freshman year. But before her season even started this year, she tore her ACL, an injury that can put athletes on the bench for more than 9 months.\n\n“It’s been an emotional journey because running is my big thing,” Harris said. “I didn’t know if I’d be able to run this season with my team and keep our streaks alive and just be there for my team because that’s what I love doing.”\n\nThrough her recovery process, she said she found out she might be able to compete this season.\n\n“I got told by my doctors that if I put in the work at physical therapy this summer, that I would be able to get back to running before surgery,” Harris said.\n\nSo that’s what she did, working every week to get better and better to overcome this injury while pushing her team to grow together through a difficult season.\n\n“In a strange way, the injury has grown us all because as a coaching staff, we’ve been able to see our kids rally around one another, and other kids got stronger and maintained that going into the season,” Girls’ athletic coordinator JB Littlejohn said.\n\nDuring this recovery, Harris became an inspiration to her teammates and peers.\n\n“She was our athlete of the Year last year as a freshman,” Littlejohn said. “Her competitive nature, combined with her work ethic, you put that with the natural talent, that’s why we’re seeing what she’s doing.”\n\nThrough determination and hard work, Landry and her team made it all the way to the state cross country meet.\n\n“It was very like congratulating, and I felt like my efforts and everything that I went through paid off finally,” Harris said.\n\nYou can now stream KETK and FOX51 News live 24/7 on your smart TV with KETK+, our brand-new app!

Morath will also appoint a conservator with governing authority over current district and campus leaders during the transition, which typically takes several months to complete.\n\nGet stories like this delivered straight to your inbox. \nThe education agency will solicit applications from local community members interested in joining each district’s board of managers. Morath will also appoint superintendents to lead the districts.\n\nThe takeovers add to the growing list of districts subject to state interventions, which also includes two of Texas’ largest: Fort Worth and Houston. The Fort Worth school board has said it plans to appeal the commissioner’s decision, which was announced in October.\n\nThe education agency said in August that five school districts were at risk of intervention after enduring five consecutive years of unsatisfactory ratings. Since then, it has announced plans to take over four of them: Fort Worth, Lake Worth, Connally and Beaumont. Morath has not said whether he plans to intervene in the fifth district, Wichita Falls.\n\nEach of the schools that triggered takeovers in the Beaumont, Connally and Lake Worth districts educates a majority Black and Hispanic student population, and the overwhelming majority of their children come from low-income families.\n\nLake Worth’s Marilyn Miller Language Academy triggered the intervention in that district. In letters informing the districts about the takeovers, Morath noted that during the latest round of accountability ratings, all but one of Lake Worth’s six campuses earned failing grades. Meanwhile, five campuses have received unacceptable ratings for more than a year, while only 22% of students are meeting grade level across all subjects.\n\nLake Worth school district leaders were acutely aware of the challenges facing the school district leading up to the takeover, said Superintendent Mark Ramirez, who was hired this year. Ramirez said the district has focused on addressing the challenges facing each campus, which should serve as a foundation for the incoming board of managers to build upon.\n\n“Our preparation ensures zero instructional loss for our children,” Ramirez said.\n\nThe Connally district had two campuses that met the state’s takeover threshold: Connally Junior High and Connally Elementary. Since the 2022-23 school year, the number of campuses with academically unacceptable scores in the district has doubled, Morath noted. Only 24% of students in the district are meeting grade level. The junior high improved from an F to a D in the most recent ratings.\n\nIn a statement, the Connally district thanked the efforts of Superintendent Jill Bottelberghe in boosting academic performance in recent years but acknowledged the need for improvements.\n\n“We recognize that there is still work that needs to be done,” the statement said. “It is our hope that the appointed Board of Managers will work to not only improve our district’s academic performance, but also serve our community with the same passion and sincerity as our Board of Trustees has.”\n\nML King Middle School and Fehl-Price Elementary in the Beaumont district have also endured five consecutive years of failing grades. The commissioner cited data showing that the elementary school has never earned an acceptable rating, while the middle school has gone 11 years without one. The district has seven campuses with unacceptable ratings for more than a year and has not earned an overall acceptable rating since 2019. Thirty percent of students in the district are meeting grade level.\n\nThomas Sigee Sr., president of the Beaumont school board, said the district had sought to help its struggling campuses — including by partnering with charter schools — but ultimately could not lift them up to state standards. He questioned why the commissioner opted to take over the entire district instead of shutting down the schools.\n\n“We could have closed the schools for a year and facilitated those students to other campuses and go forward,” Sigee said. “I didn’t want the takeover because I knew it would spread chaos in our community.”\n\nIf the decision is finalized, it would mark the second time the state has placed the Beaumont district under its oversight. The education agency did so from 2014-2020 due to financial mismanagement.\n\nEach of the three districts will have opportunities later this month to attend an informal hearing with the commissioner to make their appeals. If Morath stands by his decision to intervene, they can then formally appeal to the State Office of Administrative Hearings.\n\nTakeovers were once rare in Texas, but they have grown more common in the last decade, thanks to the 2015 law that made it easier for the state to step in after five consecutive F grades. It also expanded the commissioner’s ability to initiate special investigations, which could lead to an intervention.\n\nThat A-F grading system is largely based on the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness, a standardized exam that lawmakers voted this year to replace in 2027.\n\nBefore 2015, El Paso experienced the only academic takeover in Texas, due to a widespread cheating scandal. Since the law’s passage, the education agency has officially taken over three districts because of low academic performance: Marlin, Shepherd and Houston.\n\nMorath and state-appointed Superintendent Mike Miles believe the Houston ISD intervention was warranted, and they tout as evidence the improved test scores in the two years since it started. Students have improved in every tested subject. None of the district’s campuses received an F on the state’s accountability ratings in the 2024-25 school year, a drastic improvement from the 56 underperforming campuses in 2022-23.\n\nBut the intervention has also run into strong criticism. Teacher departures have skyrocketed. Thousands of students have unenrolled. And improved test scores have sparked concern that the district has accomplished its gains, in part, because of a hyperfocus on testing and moving students into less rigorous math and science classes.\n\nStephen Simpson, Jess Huff and Alex Nguyen contributed to this report.\n\nThis article first appeared on The Texas Tribune.",

    "description": "The young Longhorns couldn’t match the Badgers in a decisive loss.",
    "fullText": "Another deep run in the NCAA Tournament is over for the No. 1 seed Texas Longhorns (26-4) after falling to the No. 3 seed Wisconsin Badgers (28-4) in the Elite Eight on Sunday at Gregory Gymnasium in a 3-1 defeat.\n\nTexas was consistently out of system for the entire match and struggled to consistently match Wisconsin in any area of the game even though the Horns held a statistical edge in several categories. The biggest issue was the subpar performance from junior outside hitter Torrey Stafford, who hit .132 with nine kills and four attacking errors — the Longhorns needed more from their star, outshone on her home court by Badgers standout Mimi Colyer notching a match-high 23 kills on a .309 hitting percentage.\n\nThe young Texas team struggled to find answers across the board as head coach Jerritt Elliott tried to find sparks from his bench, a failed effort.\n\nIn the first set, both teams came out swinging and stayed neck to neck attacking the net at 5-5. True freshman outside hitter Abby Vander Wal aided the Longhorns with four kills during the set, alongside fellow true freshman outside hitter Cari Spears landing three kills in the first set. Texas was able to gain a small lead as Wisconsin continued to capitalize on attacks and force errors to gain a 23-17 lead. Longhorn middle blocker Nya Bunton snagged a two kills for Texas as the match closed out with Wisconsin taking the opening set, 25-22, despite the Longhorns saving five set points.\n\nIn the second set, Wisconsin jumped out to an early 4-2 lead with Colyer snagging early kills. The Longhorns cut the lead to 11-10 by forcing attacking errors, but the Badgers stayed steady, maintaining their lead with outside hitter Grace Egan swinging strong at the net to extending the lead to 18-13. The Longhorns stayed in the match with the leadership of senior outside hitter Whitney Lauenstein tagging four late kills, but the Badges closed the second set, 25-21, having never trailed in it.\n\nAll gas in the intense third set with both teams pumping attack after attack with the Longhorns taking a 8-7 lead. While both teams stayed on each others heel’s by countering each other’s attacks until Longhorn setter Rella Binney served back-to-back aces to put Texas up 15-12. The Longhorns stood strong at the net, forcing Badger errors to close the third set, 25-20, to prolong the match, albeit only briefly.\n\nIn the fourth set, the Longhorns use the momentum from the third set and go on a 4-0 run with kills from Vander Wal and Spears. The Badgers did not lay down as they were able to for errors and counter attack with the aid of outside hitter Una Vajagic to go on a 12-4 run, putting Wisconsin up, 12-8. The Longhorns managed a 4-0 run while libero Ramsey Gary landed an ace bring the match to 18-15, but the Badgers eventually closed the fourth and final set by forcing seven Longhorn errors to end the match, 25-19.",

    "description": "Before hosting Miami in the CFP, Texas A&M Edge Cashius Howell and WR KC Concepcion are projected as first-round NFL Draft selections.",
    "fullText": "Texas A&M (11-1, 7-1 SEC) is just six days away from hosting Miami (FL) (10-2) in the first round of the College Football Playoff, as both teams are headed to the tournament for the first time in program history, and will meet for the third time in the last three seasons.\n\nOn paper, both teams are highly similar, possessing NFL talent on both sides of the ball, and their starting quarterbacks, Marcel Reed and Carson Beck, each threw for 25 touchdowns and 10 interceptions during the regular season, connecting with elite playmakers.\n\nFor the Hurricanes, freshman wideout Malachi Toney is a nightmare matchup. At the same time, Texas A&M transfer wide receivers KC Concepcion and Mario Craver combined for over 1,700 yards and 15 total touchdowns, and are a mismatch for every secondary they've faced this season. With Craver expected to return next season, Concepcion will likely declare for the NFL Draft.\n\nOn defense, Texas A&M edge Cashius Howell and Miami defensive lineman Rueben Bain are both considered top 10 prospects in the 2026 NFL Draft, and have a chance to solidify their standing as elite pass rushers on Saturday afternoon. Either way, both players are headed to the draft regardless of the outcome.\n\nThis week, Pro Football Focus's Trevor Sikkema released his latest 2026 Mock Draft, projecting Cashius Howell as the 6th overall pick to the Washington Commanders, who would join former Texas A&M and future Hall of Fame defensive end Von Miller for at least one season.\n\nThe Commanders defense is in a bad place right now, and it starts up front. Howell will face plenty of skepticism about his draft range, given his very short arms for the position, yet he has earned pass-rush grades above 90.0 in three straight seasons, with win rates above 19.0% over that same span.\n\nConcepcion, who finished his first season in College Station with 57 receptions and a team-high 886 receiving yards and 9 touchdowns, paired with two punt return scores, is the perfect addition for any team looking for a Day 1 starting slot receiver and punt returner. According to Sikkema, the San Francisco 49ers will be looking to replace Debo Samuels for the first time in two seasons.\n\nWithout Deebo Samuel, it feels like the 49ers are missing that go-to yards after catch receiver. They are using running back Christian McCaffrey a lot for that, but it’s not quite the same as scheming things up for a receiver. Concepcion is averaging more than 7.0 yards after the catch this year and has that kind of acceleration and athleticism.\n\nFor the Aggies to have any shot at making it to the quarterfinals against No. 2 Ohio State, both Conecpcion and Howell will need to play their best football.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Two Texas A&M starters projected as first-round NFL Draft picks",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Texas Rangers made the choice earlier in the offseason to cut Jonah Heim loose.\n\nIt meant that the Rangers would have to seek out a new starting catcher in free agency, and now they've got their man.\n\nJansen has signed a two-year deal for $14.5 million, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan.\n\nJansen is a 30-year old catcher originally from Appleton, Wisconsin. The Blue Jays took him in the 16th round of the 2013 MLB Draft out of high school.\n\nThe righty hitter gained pretty solid acclaim as a prospect in the Toronto system and made his MLB debut in 2018. He played his first six-and-a-half seasons with the Blue Jays.\n\nMORE: Christian Yelich shows his puppy a proper appreciation of Tavon Austin\n\nIn his Toronto tenure, Jansen had a .733 OPS, hitting 71 home runs in 471 games.\n\nHe then spent half a season with the Boston Red Sox to end 2024.\n\nIn 2025, Jansen split the year between the Tampa Bay Rays and Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nJansen had an OPS of .703 with the Rays, then was pretty hot in limited duty with the Brewers, putting up a .779 OPS.\n\nNow, Jansen gets to play for yet another team.\n\nThe Rangers now have their catcher depth chart set. They have Kyle Higashioka returning for the second season of his two-year contract signed last winter.\n\nJansen would likely be the favorite to win the job, but the Rangers can feel good that they have two reliable veterans on hand.\n\nDodgers' payroll is even more loaded with Edwin Diaz\n\nIt's a good day to remember Bob Feller's brilliance and his time in the U.S. Navy\n\nHow Aroldis Chapman is able to pitch for Great Britain in the WBC\n\nWhat the Kyle Schwarber signing means for the Pittsburgh Pirates\n\nPoetic paragraph reveals Cody Bellinger's free agent landing spots\n\nRoyals keep Maikel Garcia around for a long time",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Texas Rangers have signed a former All Star who is the brother of one of this offseason's big free agent moves.\n\nNo, they didn't get Edwin Diaz. They got his brother Alexis in a deal reporter by ESPN's Jeff Passan on Friday night.\n\nAlexis is a 29-year old righty who as recently as 2023 was an All-Star closer for the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nHe made his MLB debut in 2022 and had a 1.84 ERA in 59 games.\n\nThe next season, he saved 37 games, and in 2024, he saved 28 and still had a 3.99 ERA.\n\nMORE: Christian Yelich shows his puppy a proper appreciation of Tavon Austin\n\nThe rails fell off quickly in 2025.\n\nAlexis Diaz had a 12.00 ERA in six outings with the Reds before they let him go.\n\nThe Dodgers pick him up next, and he had a 5.00 ERA in nine games there before they too let him go.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves gave Diaz a quick chance down the stretch, and he had a 10.13 ERA in three outings.\n\nIt seems like multiple teams have viewed Alexis Diaz as a worthy reclamation project. His stuff was really good as recently as a couple seasons ago.\n\nRelievers are volatile, and some never get back to their form.\n\nBut if the Rangers get Alexis Diaz back to his 2022-23 level, it'll be a huge steal to get him now in free agency.\n\nDodgers' payroll is even more loaded with Edwin Diaz\n\nIt's a good day to remember Bob Feller's brilliance and his time in the U.S. Navy\n\nHow Aroldis Chapman is able to pitch for Great Britain in the WBC\n\nWhat the Kyle Schwarber signing means for the Pittsburgh Pirates\n\nPoetic paragraph reveals Cody Bellinger's free agent landing spots\n\nRoyals keep Maikel Garcia around for a long time",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSAN ANTONIO, Texas, Dec. 12 — The Randle Lions have won 30 straight games, heading into Friday night's Texas UIL Class 5A Division II semifinal game at the Alamodome.\n\nThey'll face the Boerne [TX] Greyhounds who enter the contest with a 13-1 record.\n\nRandle is looking to defend its 2024 Class 4A state championship with one of the nation's top running backs in their backfield in junior Landen Williams-Callis.\n\nGame time is set for 8 p.m. EST (7 p.m. CST local).\n\nWATCH ON THE NFHS NETWORK:No. 28/SN No. 14 Randle [Richmond, TX] Lions vs. Boerne [TX] Greyhounds\n\nRandle adds a 32-yard field goal.\n\nAnd that's three quarters in the book. Randle comfortably on its way to return to the state championship game in defense of their 2024 title.\n\nYou-know-who scores on a 42-yard run, and Randle is starting to literally run away with this. And the guy doing the running is Landen Williams-Callis. He's got 202 yards and 5 touchdowns ... so far.\n\nThey're under way in the third quarter, and it's really just turning into another episode of the Landen Williams-Callis show. He's got his fourth touchdown of the night.\n\nBoerne played about as good as you can expect against this big Randle offense. But that late touchdown has made this a much more formidable effort, and Williams-Callis still has three touchdowns in this game.\n\nWilliams-Callis scores his third touchdown of the game from 9 yards out with just 10 seconds remaining before the half. The Lions starting to finally get some separation after getting the Greyhounds' best effort in this first half.\n\nWilliams-Callis scores his second touchdown of the game on a short 2-yard run to put the Lions back on top.\n\nRandle is forced to punt from its own end zone, and it is blocked for a safety. Boerne hanging tough with the defending champions tonight.\n\nWe've got conflicting info on the score with some reports saying it's 10-7. We'll work to clarify that and update here. The video feed for the game is not working tonight.\n\nWith just 5 seconds to play in the first quarter, Boerne gets an answer on the board.\n\nOne-hand TD catch! @HoundFootball QB Grant Sweeney finds WR Zach Frasier, who palms it for the Boerne TD!

    "fullText": "Longtime Democratic strategist James Carville accused Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) of breaking the “first rule of politics” following her announcement that she’s running for Senate.\n\nOn the Politics War Room podcast on Thursday, Carville and co-host Al Hunt expressed some hope for Democrats in the red state of Texas, but Carville laid out his problems with Crockett.\n\n“First of all, it seems like she’s well-educated. It seems like she’s got a lot of energy. But she, to me, she violates the first rule of politics, and that is, in politics, you always make it about the voters and never about yourself,” Carville said.\n\nListening to Crockett, he argued, it’s clear that it’s “a lot more about herself than it is the voters.”\n\nCarville added that Crockett can still be successful in her Senate run and recommended she collect the support of Democrats who have favored voting Republican.\n\n“You can get all the hits. You can get all the clicks. You can get on all of the TV shows. You can get in as long as you’re polemic, but you’re not helping very much,” he said.\n\nCarville still cautioned that “talking incessantly” about yourself is not what wins elections, and he hasn’t been impressed with Crockett’s “framing” and “understanding where people are coming from” on issues.\n\n“We know what wins elections. We just do,” he said. “And what wins elections is not sitting there talking incessantly about yourself. Winning elections is not how many clicks you get or how much overnight fundraising you do. Winning elections is being part of framing issues and understanding where people are coming from, and I don’t think [Congresswoman] Crockett is very good at that. I’ll be very frank.”\n\nCrockett, running with the slogan of “Texas Tough,” said she’s running for the Senate seat currently held by Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) because Democrats need a “bigger voice.” She vowed to focus on issues like affordability.\n\n“There are a lot of people that said, ‘You gotta stay in the House. We need our voice. We need you there,” she told supporters this week. “And I understand. But what we need is a bigger voice.”\n\nThe post James Carville Blasts Fellow Democrat Jasmine Crockett for Violating ‘First Rule of Politics’: ‘I’ll Be Very Frank’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "A two-day undercover sting targeting men trying to buy sex in North Texas resulted in 20 arrests at a Fort Worth hotel in November.\n\nAll arrested face felony charges of solicitation of prostitution, which carries a possible sentence of up to two years in prison for a first offense.\n\nThe Tarrant County Sheriff's Office emphasized the high local demand for commercial sex, noting that the majority of victims, traffickers, and buyers are local residents.\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas - A two-day undercover sting in November led to 20 arrests as the Tarrant County Sheriff’s Office targeted people attempting to buy sex in North Texas, authorities said.\n\nFOX 4 reporter, Peyton Yager, was granted rare behind-the-scenes access as members of the sheriff’s human trafficking unit, along with investigators from the Texas Department of Public Safety and Arlington police, conducted operations inside a Fort Worth hotel. The sting focused on men responding to online solicitation ads posted by undercover officers.\n\nInvestigators said the operation began long before officers knocked on hotel room doors. At the sheriff’s administrative building, undercover personnel posing as women posted advertisements offering sex acts for specific prices, a requirement under Texas law to meet the definition of solicitation of prostitution.\n\nOnce a suspect agreed to a sex act and a dollar amount, investigators used the phone number to run background checks and prepare the team positioned at the hotel.\n\n\"We need them to identify what sex act they want and also have the dollar amount exchanged,\" said Melinda Clark of the sheriff’s human trafficking unit.\n\nAs the men arrived for their appointments, officers moved in. Some were arrested immediately upon entering the room, while others attempted to flee or resist as officers subdued them. Turner said it is common during operations to communicate with hundreds of potential buyers, even if only a fraction ultimately shows up.\n\nThose arrested included a church sign-language interpreter, men with families and at least one person officers said intended to take a woman to a truck stop to be trafficked. Several suspects also faced drug possession or resisting arrest charges.\n\nAll were booked into the Tarrant County Jail on charges of solicitation of prostitution, which is a felony in Texas and carries a possible sentence of up to two years in prison for a first offense. None of the men has been convicted in the cases stemming from this operation.\n\n\"This is occurring every day,\" said Commander Kevin Turner, who leads the county’s human trafficking team. \"It’s unimaginable how much there is out there.\"\n\n\"It shows how strong the demand for commercial sex is here in North Texas,\" he said.\n\nTurner emphasized that human trafficking does not fit common misconceptions.\n\n\"The majority of our victims, especially when it comes to sex trafficking, were born and raised here locally,\" he said. \"The traffickers are born and raised here locally. Our buyers are born and raised here locally.\"\n\nThe nonprofit DeliverFund provided technology and data support during the sting. \"It gets busy sometimes,\" said DeliverFund’s Alisha Willemssen. \"Keeping track of who is talking to whom\" helps investigators avoid overlap as they pose as multiple online identities.\n\nAdvocates say arrests alone won’t curb the problem.\n\nThe Fort Worth nonprofit, The Net, works with survivors and also with men arrested for solicitation through its MASE (Men Against Sexual Exploitation) program, offering resources in hopes of reducing repeat offenses.\n\n\"We know that just the threat of arrest or jail time alone is not going to keep them from doing this again,\" said Ty Bowden, the organization’s associate director. \"We want to get at the root of what’s bringing them here.\"\n\nThe Tarrant County human trafficking unit, formed in 2021, has conducted several stings in recent years. As large-scale events such as the 2026 World Cup approach, Turner said law enforcement agencies are preparing for increased demand and continuing to refine their response.\n\n\"They really wanted to show how prevalent it is,\" he said, \"and how it happens at hotels near you.\"\n\nInformation in this story was provided by FOX 4's Peyton Yager.",

    "fullText": "LSU football will take the field for the Texas Bowl without three key starters. According to NOLA.com’s Wilson Alexander, cornerback Mansoor Delane, quarterback Garrett Nussmeier and linebacker Whit Weeks will all miss the Tigers’ contest against Houston due to injuries.\n\nNussmeier missing this outing shouldn’t come as a big surprise. He missed the last three games of LSU’s season due to a core injury that had been bothering him since fall camp. Since he’s likely preparing for the NFL Draft and the Tigers want to see more of sophomore quarterback Michael Van Buren, it wasn’t expected that he would play.\n\nWeeks’ absence also isn’t much of a shock. He broke his ankle during LSU’s game against Ole Miss, and despite retaking the field for the Tigers’ final two games of the season, he probably needs to focus on rehabbing for either his senior season with the Tigers or the NFL draft.\n\nThe same goes for Delane, who played through a core injury for most of the season and is expected to be a first-round pick in the upcoming 2026 NFL draft.\n\nLSU has already gotten a good look at the depth behind Weeks and Nussmeier due to their missed time, but Delane being out will give Tigers fans an early look at the young cornerback duo of D.J. Pickett and P.J. Woodland, the latter of whom spent more time in the slot during the games when Delane was healthy.\n\nLSU will face the Houston Cougars on December 27th at 8:15 CT.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: LSU football rules out three starters for bowl game vs Houston",

    "fullText": "Quarterback recruiting in the 2026 cycle was a breeze for Arizona State. It identified El Paso (Texas) Del Valle four-star quarterback Jake Fette as a top target and landed his commitment in September of 2024.\n\nThe Rivals top-100 prospect saw his stock soar heading into his senior season and that led to other high-profile programs checking in. Fette stayed solid with the Sun Devils, though, signing with the Big 12 program last week. He’s the No. 7 QB in the Rivals300.\n\nWith National Signing Day for the 2026 cycle now in the past, many are now getting a feel for the 2027 board. When looking at junior QBs, though, many are already committed. Of the top 25 signal-callers in the cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, 14 are pledged.\n\nAccording to the Rivals Recruiting Prediction Machine, Arizona State is trending for one of the top uncommitted 2027 QBs in the nation. Once again, he resides in the Lone Star State.\n\nBastrop (Texas) four-star QB Weston Nielsen told Rivals’ Sam Spiegelman at the end of September that no program was recruiting him harder than ASU. Now, Spiegelman has been joined by Rivals’ Steve Wiltfong, who logged a pick this month in favor of the Sun Devils landing Nielsen’s commitment.\n\nThe 6-foot-1, 175-pounder will announce his commitment this Saturday, Dec. 13. Arrows continue to point toward Tempe and Kenny Dillingham.\n\n“They still sit pretty high on my board after another visit,” Nielsen told Spiegelman this fall. “They are recruiting me the hardest. They were able to tell me about their program and why they are a good place to be. I definitely felt more connected with them when I left.”\n\nNielsen eclipsed 3,000 passing yards for the second season in a row this fall. Bastrop went 10-3 and the blue-chipper threw 44 touchdowns to just six interceptions. He also rushed for five scores and now has over 100 total TDs to his name at the high school level.\n\nNielsen is the No. 269 overall prospect and No. 20 QB in the 2027 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all major recruiting media companies. He’s also the No. 42 player in Texas.\n\nThe Sun Devils opened their 2027 class earlier this month by landing a pledge from Chino Hills (Calif.) Orange Lutheran four-star wide receiver Nico Bland. He checks in as the No. 188 recruit and No. 23 WR in the nation.\n\nAlong with Fette, ASU signed 18 other prospects and compiled the No. 35 class in the nation, according to the Rivals Industry Team Recruiting Rankings. The class can be seen here.",

    "fullText": "A recent statewide ranking named the Austin-area suburb Leander as the No. 5 best city in Texas to move to for 2025, and other Austin neighbors made the list as well.\n\nThe analysis, conducted by a customer review and news platform called ConsumerAffairs, evaluated the 50 most populated Texas cities across five categories: affordability, safety, economy, health care and education, in addition to overall quality of life, to determine which cities were best to move to. Each city earned a score out of 100 possible points.\n\nLeander stood out, the analysis said, for its safety ranking — No. 1 statewide — and it also secured the No. 2 spot for its booming economy.\n\nHowever, the city’s rankings were more modest in other areas. The report ranked Leader No. 12 for health care and education, No. 32 for affordability and No. 40 for quality of life.\n\n“Leander’s origin dates back to the 1880s, when a rail line was constructed to connect Austin to Abilene,” the report said. “Nowhere among Texas’ largest cities is violent crime less common, and over the past five years, no metro area has experienced faster job growth.”\n\nThe suburb, which has a population of around 78,000, was also ranked as one of the top ten places to live by U.S. News and World Reports for 2025-2026.\n\nThe top four cities on the ConsumerAffairs list were all in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, followed by Leander and then Round Rock at No. 9.",

    "description": "The U.S.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court in a free speech case on Monday opted not to hear an appeal by a group of residents of a rural Texas county of a judicial decision allowing local officials to remove ​17 books that these officials deemed objectionable from public libraries.\n\nThe justices let stand a lower court's decision allowing the removal of books ‌including ones dealing with themes of race and LGBT identity, from its public library system. The lower court rejected the argument made by the plaintiffs that removing the books was ‌unlawful under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protections against government abridgment of free speech.\n\nThe decision by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals applies to the states of Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi but does not set a nationwide legal precedent.\n\nThere has been a surge in book banning in public schools and public libraries in recent years in many locations around the United States, driven by conservative groups and new state laws limiting what kinds of books children ⁠can access.\n\nLlano County is a rural area about 80 ‌miles (130 km) from the Texas state capital Austin. The dispute began in 2021 when one faction of local residents asked the Llano County library commissioner to remove the disputed books, which covered topics including transgender issues, race and slavery ‍in the United States, puberty and bodily functions like flatulence.\n\nThe 17 works at issue include the 1970 book \"In the Night Kitchen\" by acclaimed author Maurice Sendak due to the depiction of its main character, a boy named Mickey, as nude in some of its illustrations as he visits a surreal kitchen in a dream.\n\nThe library commission ​ordered librarians to comply with the demands, and residents who pushed for the book removals were appointed to a local county board.\n\nA different group ‌of county residents sued to challenge the book ban, alleging their First Amendment rights had been violated.\n\nAt issue is a First Amendment principle called the right to receive information. The Supreme Court long ago concluded that the First Amendment encompasses a fundamental right to receive information and ideas, as it is necessary for the meaningful exercise of other First Amendment rights such as freedom of religion, expression, speech, assembly and the press.\n\nA federal judge in 2023 ordered county officials to restore the disputed books to the library system. But the 5th Circuit in a 10-7 decision reversed the judge's ruling and sided ⁠with the county. The 5th Circuit concluded that public library patrons have no right ​to receive information under the First Amendment.\n\nWriting for the 5th Circuit, Judge Stuart Kyle Duncan ​asserted that \"no one is banning\" books by removing them from libraries.\n\n\"If a disappointed patron can't find a book in the library, he can order it online, buy it from a bookstore or borrow it from a friend,\" wrote Duncan, a ‍judicial appointee of Republican President Donald Trump. \"All ⁠Llano County has done here is what libraries have been doing for two centuries: decide which books they want in their collections.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in a 1982 case that school boards may not remove books because they dislike the ideas contained in those titles. The ⁠justices splintered in their reasoning at that time, leaving the scope of the First Amendment right to receive information unclear.\n\nIn another case, the Supreme Court in June ruled in favor ‌of Christian and Muslim parents in Maryland who sued to keep their elementary school children out of certain classes when ‌storybooks with LGBT characters are read.",

    "fullText": "AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear an appeal on a Texas free speech case that allowed local officials to remove books deemed objectionable from public libraries.\n\nThe case stemmed from a 2022 lawsuit by a group of residents in rural Llano County over the removal from the public library of more than a dozen books dealing with sex, race and gender themes, as well as humorously touching on topics such as flatulence.\n\nA lower federal appeals court had ruled that removing the books did not violate Constitutional free speech protections.\n\nThe case had been closely watched by publishers and librarians across the country. The Supreme Court's decision to not consider the case was criticized by free speech rights groups.\n\nThe Texas case has already been used to ban books in other areas of the country, said Elly Brinkley, staff attorney for U.S. Free Expression Programs at PEN America.\n\n“Leaving the Fifth Circuit’s ruling in place erodes the most elemental principles of free speech and allows state and local governments to exert ideological control over the people with impunity. The government has no place telling people what they can and cannot read,\" Brinkley said.\n\nSam Helmick, president of the American Library Association, said the Supreme Court's decision not to consider the case \"threatens to transform government libraries into centers for indoctrination instead of protecting them as centers of open inquiry, undermining the First Amendment right to read unfettered by viewpoint-based censorship.”\n\nThe Texas case began when a group of residents asked the county library commission to remove the group of books from circulation. The local commission ordered librarians to comply and a separate group of residents sued to keep the books on the shelves.\n\nLlano County, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) northwest of the Texas capital of Austin, has a population of about 20,000. It is mostly white and conservative, with deep ties to agriculture and deer hunting.\n\nThe book titles originally ordered removed included, “Caste: The Origins of Our Discontent” by Isabel Wilkerson; “They Called Themselves the K.K.K: The Birth of an American Terrorist Group,” by Susan Campbell Bartoletti; “In the Night Kitchen” by Maurice Sendak; “It’s Perfectly Normal: Changing Bodies, Growing Up, Sex and Sexual Health” by Robie H. Harris; and “Being Jazz: My Life as a (Transgender) Teen” by Jazz Jennings.\n\nOther titles include “Larry the Farting Leprechaun” by Jane Bexley and “My Butt is So Noisy!” by Dawn McMillan.\n\nA federal judge ordered the county to restore some of the books in 2023, but that decision was reversed earlier this year by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.\n\nThe county at one point briefly considered closing its public libraries rather than return the books to the shelves after the federal judge's initial order.\n\nIn its order on May 23, the appeals court's majority opinion said the decision to remove a book from the library shelf is not a book ban.\n\n“No one is banning (or burning books). If a disappointed patron can't find a book in the library, he can order it online, buy it from a bookstore or borrow it from a friend,” the appeals court opinion said.\n\nLlano County Judge Ron Cunningham, the ranking official in the county, did not immediately respond to an email to his office seeking comment.\n\nHillel Italie contributed from New York City.",
