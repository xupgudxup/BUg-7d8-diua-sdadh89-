    "description": "A newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch delivered a sharp warning to President Donald Trump after a high-profile Republican loss.

It comes after a Trump-endorsed candidate for the Texas state senate lost to a Democrat over the weekend.",
    "fullText": "A newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch delivered a sharp warning to President Donald Trump after a high-profile Republican loss.\n\nIn a new editorial, The Wall Street Journal warned Trump that a hardline immigration strategy promoted by top aide Stephen Miller is fueling voter backlash.\n\nIt comes after a Trump-endorsed candidate for the Texas state senate lost to a Democrat over the weekend.\n\n“How does a Republican lose by 14 points in a safe conservative Texas state Senate seat that President Trump carried by 17 points in 2024? Answer: When there’s a voter backlash against the Trump Administration, notably its mass deportation debacles,” the Journal wrote, describing the special election in Tarrant County.\n\nDemocrat Taylor Rehmet, a labor union leader and veteran, easily defeated Republican Leigh Wambsganss, who had Trump’s endorsement on Truth Social and vastly outspent her opponent.\n\nRehment is the first Democrat to hold the seat in decades.\n\nThe paper noted the timing was disastrous for Republicans, coming after the high-profile Minneapolis killings by federal immigration agents. “The 31-point vote swing in a little more than 14 months can only be explained as part of a rising tide of opposition to Mr. Trump’s first year and a sour public mood,” the Journal observed.\n\nThe White House has faced mounting national backlash after federal immigration agents fatally shot two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis—Renee Good in early January and Alex Pretti later that month—as part of aggressive enforcement operations in the state.\n\nBoth cases sparked controversy over conflicting official narratives. In Pretti’s case, Homeland Security officials and White House aides initially claimed he approached agents with a gun and posed a threat, while bystander videos show him holding only a cellphone before being pinned down and shot.\n\nSimilarly, authorities initially suggested that Good tried to ram agents with her vehicle before she was fatally shot, a claim contradicted by eyewitness footage and reporting. Critics argue these early statements painted both victims as dangerous to justify the shootings, fueling accusations that the administration misrepresented the events.\n\nThe killings came after Trump deployed thousands of federal immigration agents to Minneapolis as part of an aggressive immigration strategy masterminded by Miller.\n\nMiller’s immigration strategy under Trump has pushed aggressive mass arrests and deportations, with ICE agents pressured to meet high daily quotas, even targeting non-criminal undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal critiqued Miller’s hardline tactics, including a daily quota of 3,000 migrant arrests that it says “was bound to result in agent intrusions into homes and businesses.”\n\nWhile immigration has historically been a winning issue for Republicans, the Journal cautioned that enforcement “that turns ugly in the streets is turning off the swing voters who will determine who wins the race for Congress this year.”\n\nPolls have recently shown Americans turning on Trump and his immigration strategy ahead of the 2026 Midterms. A YouGov poll conducted on January 25 showed that about half (48 percent) of respondents do not think the shooting of Pretti in Minneapolis was justified.\n\nAnother YouGov poll showed that 52 percent of Americans think the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict immigration to the U.S. have gone too far.\n\nAs a result, the paper concluded that even as Trump signals a desire to “dial back the confrontations on the street,” he must also reconsider Miller’s influence. “The Miller strategy isn’t likely to fare better this year,” the editorial warned.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal is not the first Murdoch-owned newspaper to publicly condemn Trump’s immigration strategy.\n\nIn an op-ed published last week, the New York Post argued that the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement in Minneapolis is backfiring politically.\n\n“These enforcement tactics won’t turn the tide, instead they are backfiring,” the Post wrote.",

    "fullText": "The father of a 5-year-old boy who was detained by immigration officers and held at an federal facility in Texas denied government accounts Monday that he abandoned his son as the pair returned to Minnesota.\n\nAdrian Conejo Arias, who is originally from Ecudador, told ABC News that he loves his son, Liam, and would never abandon him, disputing statements from the Department of Homeland Security, which alleged that Arias had left his child in a vehicle. He also said his son got sick while in federal custody but was denied medicine.\n\nAssistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that Arias fled on foot before he was arrested, “abandoning his child.” She said Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers stayed with the boy.\n\n“The facts in this case have NOT changed: The father who was illegally in the country chose to take his child with him to a detention center,\" she said.\n\nMcLaughlin did not address Arias' statement that his son was denied medication while in custody.\n\nArias also said he was arrested unjustly and contended he was in the country legally, with a pending court hearing for asylum.\n\nThe comments come after a federal judge ordered over the weekend that the pair be freed. They were released Sunday and returned to Minnesota, according to Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas.\n\nThe family's arrest and release unfolded during President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration, which has led to daily protests that included the shooting deaths of two American citizens by federal officers. The president last week ordered his top border adviser to oversee the crackdown days after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti, an intensive care nurse at a Veterans Affairs hospital.\n\nBorder czar Tom Homan suggested that mistakes have been made, but he said agents would continue to enforce federal law and called on local and state officials to cooperate with federal officers.\n\nThe boy's detention drew outrage as images of immigration officers surrounding the young boy in a blue bunny hat and Spider-Man backpack began to surface.\n\nMcLaughlin said ICE did not target or arrest the boy, and she repeated assertions that his mother refused to take him after his father’s apprehension. His father told officers he wanted Liam to be with him, she said.\n\nMcLaughlin also said last month that the child was abandoned and that officers tried to get the mother to take custody of the child. “Officers even assured her she would NOT be taken into custody.”\n\nNeighbors and school officials said federal officers used the child as “bait,” telling him to knock on his house’s door so his mother would come out. DHS disputed that description.\n\nMarcos Charles, acting executive associate director of ICE enforcement and removal operations, faulted the father for “abandoning his child in the middle of winter in a vehicle.” He told reporters one officer stayed with the child while others arrested the father.\n\nThe government said the boy’s father entered the U.S. illegally from Ecuador in December 2024. The family’s lawyer said he has a pending asylum claim that allows him to stay in the U.S.\n\nThe vast majority of asylum-seekers are released in the United States, with adults having eligibility for work permits, while their cases wind through a backlogged court system.\n\nEcuadorians, who left in droves in recent years as their country spiraled into violence, have fared poorly in immigration court, with judges granting asylum in 12.5% of decisions in the 12-month period through September, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering and research organization based at Syracuse University.\n\nIn ordering the release of Liam and his father, U.S. District Judge Fred Biery blasted the administration, writing that the case had “its genesis in the ill-conceived and incompetently-implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatizing children.”\n\nThe Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review’s online court docket shows no future hearings for Liam’s father.",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M's (17-4, 7-1 SEC) NCAA Tournament resume is looking better every week, as the Aggies are riding a four-game winning streak in SEC play after defeating Georgia on the road 92-77 behind another balanced scoring effort resulting in five players scoring in double figures, led by senior forward Rashaun Agee's 18 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists, recorded his tenth double-double of the season.\n\nUnder first-year head coach Bucky McMillan, the Aggies aren't lacking confidence, and after losing a close game to SMU on the road during the latter half of non-conference play, Texas A&M has lost just one game since, dropping a double-overtime road matchup vs. Tennessee, which should have gone the other way if free throws and questionable officiating weren't an issue.\n\nLeading the SEC at 7-1, three of Texas A&M's conference wins are Quad 1A victories, which, according to the NCAA NET rankings, are wins against teams ranked in the top 15 ranked teams at home, top 25 on a neutral court, and top 40 on the road in the NET standings. Tied with Tennessee and Kentucky, here are the SEC teams with more than one Quad 1A win.\n\nOver the next four games against Alabama (road), Florida (home), Missouri (road), and Vanderbilt (road), Texas A&M will have three Quad 1A opportunities, and winning one, or two of these tough matchups would likely guarentee the Aggies an at-large bid in the NCAA Tournament, especially given the fact that McMillan's squad is a perfect 12-0 in Quad 3 and Quad 3 games.\n\nAfter Florida blew out Alabama 100-77 on Sunday night, Texas A&M has a chance to take advantage of the Crimson Tide's short turnaround before playing on Wednesday, but needs to play with the same mentality, and shoot at least 45% from the field, and hit free throws to have a chance at pulling off the upset.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M basketball's three Quad 1A wins tied for most in the SEC",

    "fullText": "The president self-soothed by going on a Truth Social posting spree after the Republican Party suffered a major upset in Texas.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, 79, made seven posts in the span of just three minutes on Sunday afternoon and reposted six endorsements he made over the last week after a Democratic candidate secured a decisive victory in Texas’ deep-red 9th State Senate District, which he carried by more than 17 points in 2024.\n\nFirst-time candidate Taylor Rehmet, 33, became the first Democrat to hold the seat in decades after handing a resounding defeat to MAGA activist Leigh Wambsganss, 57 percent to 43 percent.\n\nTrump played nonchalant after the stunning loss in the solidly Republican district by touting the supposed success of his policies.\n\nThe president reposted opinion pieces from the Des Moines Register and Bari Weiss-founded The Free Press titled, “Iowans are earning more, paying less after Trump’s return” and “How Trump Won Davos.”\n\nTrump also published a screenshot of a Jan. 26 X post by Roma Daravi, vice president for public relations of the newly MAGA-fied Kennedy Center, thanking him for “saving America’s cultural center.”\n\nThe president posted another screenshot, this time going all the way back to Dec. 3 last year, of an X post by Texas Democrat Henry Cuellar lavishing praise for Trump’s “tremendous leadership.” At the time, Trump had pardoned Cuellar, who was indicted on a dozen charges, including bribery, conspiracy, and money laundering.\n\nIn another Truth Social post, Trump bragged about receiving a letter dated Feb. 23, 1989, from convicted felon George M. Steinbrenner III, the principal owner and managing partner of the New York Yankees for more than three decades.\n\n“You were great! You tell it like it is,” Steinbrenner wrote. “It is like I said to Stephen, you should run for President some day and get the whole damn thing straightened out.”\n\nIn yet another post, the president daydreamed over a rendering of his planned “Arc de Trump.”\n\nThe president also posted endorsements he had made in races in New Hampshire and Indiana.\n\nIn the case of Texas’ 9th State Senate District, however, Trump’s Truth Social endorsements didn’t carry Wambsganss to victory.\n\nTrump endorsed Wambsganss in three posts made between early Friday morning and Saturday afternoon.\n\n“Today is the day!” Trump wrote on Saturday. “To all Voters in Texas’ 9th State Senate District: GET OUT AND VOTE for a phenomenal Candidate, Leigh Wambsganss. She is a highly successful Entrepreneur, and an incredible supporter of our Movement to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.”\n\nAfter Wambsganss lost, Trump pretended to be blissfully unaware of the election he had made three posts about.\n\n“I don’t know. I didn’t hear about it,” he told reporters in Mar-a-Lago on Sunday.\n\n“I’m not involved in that. That’s a local Texas race. You mean I won by 17 [points], and this person lost?” he said before shrugging. “Things like that happen.”",

Turner, who was first elected to Congress in November 2024 and died last year, had himself succeeded the late Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D), after she died the July prior.\n\nMenefee will serve the remainder of Turner’s term, but will then run again for a full term for the seat in March after the district was redrawn last year.

    "fullText": "Texas A&M (17-4, 7-1 SEC) should be undefeated in SEC play if it weren't for missed free throws down the stretch of the double-overtime loss at Tennessee, as the Aggies have not lost since, and while efficient shooting, paired with improved rebounding have certainly aided the team, resulting in three straight double-digit wins, first-year head coach Bucky McMillan deserve a ton of credit for gearing the focus back to the free throw line.\n\nAs a team, the Aggies are shooting 74.8% from the stripe, while Spanish sharpshooter Ruben Dominguez leads the team at 90%, while six players are shooting 80% or better.\n\nOn Saturday, the Aggies earned their third Quad 1A win after defeating Georgia on the road 92-77, and shot 45% from the field, and 38% from beyond the arc, and outside of winning the rebounding battle 46-39, Texas A&M finished an impressive 19-20 from the free-throw line, and was perfect in the final minutes of the second half.\n\nDuring former head coach Buzz Williams' career in College Station, the Aggies struggled at the free throw line, which directly led to frustrating losses in and out of conference play, and while the offense never flourished under Williams like we've seen under McMillan this season, free throws continued to make or break outcomes for every team, no matter the play style.\n\n\"Bucky Ball\" is built on three-point shooting and high-percentage shots near the rim, while the press defense, comically dubbed the \"mother-in-law\" defense by McMillan, has continued to force turnovers, leading to fast-break points and big leads over the last three games.\n\nStill, in the last three wins, the Aggies were nearly perfect from the free throw line, converting 51-54 attempts for a 94.4% success rate, which, combined with 39 three-pointers, Texas A&M's offense has looked unstoppable, and will continue to score 90 points or more if this success at the stripe continues in conference play.\n\nWhile the size differential is notable over the next two games against Alabama on the road and Florida at home, Texas A&M's fast-paced play style frustrated Auburn and Texas, who both possessed more size in the paint, and if the Aggies continue to convert at the free throw line, anything is possible moving forward.\n\nOver its last three games combined, Texas A&M men's basketball is 51 of 54 (94.4%) from the free throw line.

    "fullText": "The Buffs have remained aggressive in the portal, so here’s a top five you need to know right now. We’ll count down from No. 5 to No. 1 and hit why each addition fits, and how they raise the floor this fall.\n\nLefau is a senior transfer from Texas who comes to Boulder looking to revitalize the Buffs pass rush. He posted 26 tackles and 1 sack last year, and more importantly spent time in one of the best pass rushing groups in the nation. That experience matters for a defense that will be rebuilt front to back. His veteran voice and habits are vital for a unit that has started slow in recent seasons because so many portal additions had to gel at once. Experience is the point here, and it is going to be key across the entire defense.\n\nYes, the name and backstory drew headlines, but the on-field production backs it up. Lampron is a journeyman senior who tallied 65 tackles, 2.5 sacks, and 2 forced fumbles last season for Bowling Green. The origin story matters too, as Lampron randomly ran into Coach Prime on a plane a few months ago and gave coach his pitch. Prime’s staff did the homework, and Lampron had an offer before they even deboarded. With the Buffs staring at a completely new defensive unit next season; Lampron brings toughness, proven production, and immediate special teams value to steady that transition.\n\nScudero arrives in Boulder after turning in one of the best sophomore campaigns in the country with nearly 1,300 receiving yards and 11 touchdowns. At 5’9, 175, he wins with agility, quickness, and crisp route running. In Brennan Marion’s system he’s a plug-and-play starting slot, the kind of chain-mover who keeps JuJu on schedule and punishes single coverage. He is also one of the most talented portal additions Boulder has seen in the last few years, so there is no reason to think he won’t be on the field from the first series in the fall.\n\nCarter arrives from Tennessee, a hometown Vol who had a real path to playing time in the SEC, which tells you the offer to come to Boulder was serious, and for good reason. He was ranked the No. 5 safety in the transfer portal and his tape backs it up. Last season he played like a ball magnet, forcing three fumbles and breaking up three passes. For a Buffs team that has struggled to force turnovers, and just lost turnover-creator Tawfiq Byard, Carter was a must-sign for Deion Sanders. He has two years of eligibility left, but may need to produce immediately in a playmaking-needy back end.\n\nA St. John Bosco grad, Moore comes to Boulder with one year of eligibility and a top-ten transfer grade (No. 8 in the portal). At Texas he stacked just under 1,000 yards and 11 touchdowns across the last two seasons as a starting wideout. His 6’0, 190 frame is not about freak measurables, as it is the ideal all-purpose receiver body that lets Brennan Marion fit him seamlessly into the Go-Go offense. After the departures of Omarion Miller, Sincere Brown, and others, Moore is expected to have the biggest season of any incoming transfer. Personally, I think he profiles as the X reciever, where he’ll be expected to win outside the numbers, on slants, digs, comebacks, and posts. Moore has the experience, production, and frame to be JuJu Lewis’s No. 1 target come September.",

    "title": "Texas A&M Ends Women's Studies and Overhauls Classes Over Race and Gender",
    "description": "New policies limiting the teaching of race and gender issues led administrators and professors to change hundreds of courses. School leaders say the rules could hurt A&M’s reputation.",
    "fullText": "Texas A&M University said on Friday that it would end its women’s and gender studies program, and that the syllabuses for hundreds of courses had been altered under new policies limiting how race and gender ideology may be discussed in classrooms.\n\nThe university said that six courses had been canceled entirely because of the new rules, out of the roughly 5,400 that were planned for this semester at one of the nation’s largest public universities.\n\nThe A&M system’s regents — all of them appointed by Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican — approved the restrictive policies late last year, and officials have been scrambling since then to interpret and enforce them. Supporters contend that the rules are appropriate measures to prevent political ideologies, especially those often associated with the left, from entering classrooms. Opponents say the approach encourages self-censorship and is itself ideological.\n\nA top-down demand to scrutinize a university’s entire course catalog in so short a time is extraordinarily rare in the United States, where professors have long had sweeping control over their syllabuses.\n\n“I have never seen anything like this,” said Leonard Bright, a professor in A&M’s Bush School of Government and Public Service and the president of the American Association of University Professors chapter in College Station, where the A&M system has its flagship campus of more than 74,000 students.\n\nThe regents do not seem interested in the academic freedom of students and the faculty, he added, only the “freedom of their speech.”\n\nFriday’s announcement about shutting down the university’s women’s and gender studies program went beyond the immediate repercussions that many people had anticipated.\n\nTommy Williams, the university’s interim president, said in a statement that he had directed the closure because of low enrollment and “the difficulty of bringing the program in compliance with the new system policies.” He said that students who were already pursuing degrees or certificates in the program would be able to complete them.\n\nIn 2024, the regents ordered A&M to drop its minor in L.G.B.T.Q. studies. But ending a full bachelor’s degree program represents a sharp escalation in the debate over what should be taught at public universities in Texas, the nation’s most populous conservative state.\n\nA&M is not the first school to drop gender studies. New College of Florida, for example, moved in 2023 to shut down its program, which had operated for decades.\n\nUntil Friday, discussions at A&M had often focused on how individual courses this semester would be affected by the new limits, which Mr. Williams argued in an interview this week had “restored rigor into some areas where maybe we had had some drift.”\n\n“This has given us a transparent way to go through and make sure that what we’re advertising the course is about is actually what’s being taught,” he said on Tuesday, adding that the approach “strengthens academic integrity, it protects our academic standards and, I think, most importantly, it builds trust in higher education.”\n\nA&M officials have nevertheless been bracing for recriminations, including possible court challenges, and for prospective students or professors to be thinking twice about heading to College Station.\n\n“It’s been harmful to our reputation, there’s no question about that,” said Mr. Williams, a Republican former state legislator. “But I think it’s transitory.”\n\nMr. Williams, who previously worked for Mr. Abbott, said he had not discussed the policies with the governor. And during the interview, Mr. Williams did not mention any plans concerning the women’s and gender studies program, which currently has 28 students enrolled in its major.\n\nUnder the new systemwide policies, no A&M course may “advocate race or gender ideology, or topics related to sexual orientation or gender identity.” Certain classes that are not part of the core curriculum may include teaching about those subjects, but only if a campus president agrees that there is “a necessary educational purpose.”\n\nAsked whether any part of him believed that the policies went too far, Mr. Williams replied, “No.” Pressed on whether deans and department heads would share that view, Mr. Williams responded, “Some would and some would not.”\n\nFor the most part, those deans and department heads have been the ones trying to navigate how far A&M should go in excising content.\n\n“Day by day, we began to have a clearer understanding of where the line may be,” said Simon North, the interim dean of the College of Arts and Sciences in College Station.\n\nDr. North acknowledged, though, that it was impossible to know exactly how many courses had been affected because some faculty members may have modified their syllabuses themselves.\n\n“There are actions that people took in consultation with us,” Dr. North said, “and there are actions that people may have done on their own.”\n\nSyllabus reviews largely took place at the departmental and college levels, but some reached the interim president’s desk. As he prepared this week to weigh requests for exemptions, Mr. Williams said that “common sense is what we’re trying to use as our gauge.”\n\nHe said that A&M officials were not looking to cut material in ways that might prevent students from being competitive in the marketplace, and that opponents of the new rules had “confused what academic freedom is.”\n\n“It doesn’t mean you get to do whatever you want to in the classroom,” he said. “You have academic freedom, but it comes along with the responsibility, and part of that responsibility is to make sure that the learning outcomes are achieved and they’re done in a way that’s compliant with state and federal law and what our regents mandate us to do.”\n\nEven before the wholesale course review, Texas A&M was debating what content was appropriate in college classrooms. In September, the university fired a lecturer for displaying a gender unicorn — which is used to explain the differences between gender expression and gender identity — during a course on children’s literature. The president of the university at the time — Mr. Williams’s predecessor — quickly stepped down.\n\nA faculty appeals panel ruled that the university was “not justified” when it ousted the lecturer, Melissa McCoul, but A&M has refused to reinstate her.\n\nThen the regents’ policies deepened the turmoil. One of the largest ruptures unspooled in the philosophy department, after a professor, Martin Peterson, proposed including portions of Plato’s Symposium in a contemporary moral issues course that can be used to fulfill a core curriculum requirement.\n\nHe also scheduled teaching modules covering race and gender ideology. He had discussed similar topics in the course in the past, though previous syllabuses showed that the modules had different names, like “race and gender issues.”\n\nKristi Sweet, the head of the philosophy department, asked him to “mitigate” the course to remove that content, or face reassignment to a different class. After the dispute became public, university officials repeatedly suggested that Dr. Peterson had constructed his syllabus as a provocation.\n\nDr. Peterson acknowledged that he had wanted to “test the waters,” but he said in an interview this week that he thought the Platonic passages would be less contentious than material he had assigned in the past: an excerpt from the Supreme Court ruling that recognized a right to same-sex marriage. He has since replaced the disputed modules and Plato readings with lessons about academic freedom.\n\nAdministrators note that Plato appears in the syllabuses for other classes.\n\n“Hundreds of Aggies are reading Plato in their courses right now,” Dr. Sweet said. She added that the entirety of Plato’s Symposium was being taught in the Philosophy of Art course, and that despite a wide outcry over its handling of the Peterson class, the department’s “strategic priorities for continued excellence are untouched by current events.”\n\nDr. Bright, the A.A.U.P. chapter president, has faced questions about his own courses. Administrators initially flagged an article that included discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity. But the dean of the Bush School, John Sherman, told Dr. Bright that administrators would support letting him use that text, “given the scholarly nature of the work and the applicability of the reading.”\n\nAnother of Dr. Bright’s courses worried administrators more.\n\nDr. Bright wrote that the course would examine the impact of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation and other social identities “on public policy and the professional ethical responsibilities of public servants.”\n\nDr. Sherman asked him how sexual orientation would be covered. After Dr. Bright responded that it was impossible to say exactly when the subject might come up in a discussion-driven course, the dean canceled the class.\n\n“To say this gives me no pleasure is an understatement,” Dr. Sherman wrote. “To be clear, transparency does not equate to censorship.”\n\nDr. Bright said that university leaders had made an impossible demand about a course that is often shaped by current events.\n\nIt is rare for university governing boards to make decisions that reach so far into classrooms so quickly. Still, R. Bowen Loftin, a former A&M president, said there were few practical options available to campus officials who might disagree with the regents.\n\n“When you become an administrator, especially at a public institution, there’s going to be limits on what you can say and what you can do, and you have to come to grips with that,” he said.\n\nDr. North, the arts and sciences dean, said “questions of academic freedom and academic responsibilities are really difficult,” but that he was “trying to implement these changes in a way that puts students first and supports faculty.”\n\nDr. Bright showed little patience with such defenses.\n\n“When it comes to certain things, you’ve got to say no,” he said. “I don’t excuse administrators from that responsibility.”",

    "fullText": "One week after her 8-year-old son was killed in a crash along Highway 114 in Wise County, a Rhome mother is calling on the state to make changes she believes could prevent another tragedy.\n\nHer son, Matteo Rodriguez, was riding home from school last Thursday, sitting in the passenger seat with his grandmother, when their vehicle was struck at the intersection of Highway 114 and Alliance Boulevard in Rhome, also known as County Road 4841.\n\nWise County EMS said the crash happened as the vehicle was turning and a three-quarter-ton truck his grandmother could not see. The truck struck the passenger side, hitting Matteo.\n\nThe second grader at Prairie View Elementary School in Northwest ISD lost his pulse at the scene.\n\nFirst responders were able to revive him, and he was airlifted to Cook Children’s Medical Center. However, Matteo died during the flight.\n\n“At first I was shocked,” his mother said. “I was like, no. Don’t say that.”\n\nShe said Matteo’s grandmother immediately blamed herself.\n\n“She said, ‘I killed your son,’” Matteo’s mother said. “She blamed herself from the very first moment.”\n\nNow, Matteo’s mother is pushing for change at the intersection where her son was killed. She has launched a Change.org petition calling on the Texas Department of Transportation to install a traffic signal at the busy crossing. As of this week, the petition has gathered more than 9,000 signatures.\n\nWhen asked if a traffic light could have made a difference, she did not hesitate.\n\n“Yes,” she said. “Totally. With all my heart.”\n\nWFAA reached out to TxDOT about the incident, but has not received a response.\n\nMatteo’s mother is a Kindergarten teacher at his elementary school. She said her last moments with him were simple and joyful.\n\nA student had gifted her a small ladybug stuffed animal, and Matteo was excited to take it home.\n\n“I told him, remember you have the ladybug,” she said. “Put it in your backpack so we can bring it back tomorrow. He left so happy.”\n\nAfter Matteo died, she noticed something that stopped her.\n\n“When I entered the hospital room, he had the ladybug on his shoulder,” she said. “The ladybug came back to me, but not him.”\n\nMatteo was her youngest child, born after she suffered a miscarriage.\n\n“They ripped part of my heart,” she said. “I won’t be able to see my kid graduate.”\n\nDespite the grief, she says she will keep pushing for change, hoping Matteo’s story leads to action and saves lives.\n\n“I don’t want another family to go through this,” she said.",

    "fullText": "EL PASO, Texas (KTSM) — El Paso District Court Judge Marlene Gonzalez is stepping back from cases involving migrant children, following allegations that she behaved impartially and prejudiced toward them in hearings.\n\n“As a judge, the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct prevents me from submitting to an interview or commenting on a case that I have recused myself from hearing. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to provide this response,” read a statement from Gonzalez who noted she voluntarily recused herself from hearings regarding unaccompanied migrant children’s cases.\n\nOn Dec. 17, 2025, attorneys from Estrella del Paso – an immigrant advocacy organization – filed a motion to recuse Gonzalez from hearings involving unaccompanied migrant children – children entering the U.S. illegally and without a parent or guardian.\n\nIn the court filing, attorneys and social services workers with the organization submitted written declarations detailing allegations that Gonzalez showed a “pattern and practice of cruelty” towards migrant children during the hearings.\n\nThe declarations made allegations that Gonzalez would subject children to humiliating interrogations about why they left their country, and that on multiple occasions she shamed the children for abandoning their parents.\n\nIn one account an attorney alleged that Gonzalez interrogated a 17-year-old Guatemalan boy who testified that he fled his country to Mexico from an abusive alcoholic father, but that he was kidnapped and beat up twice while in Mexico. The attorney alleged that in response, Gonzalez “harangued” the boy: “Why didn’t you stay in another part of Mexico? It’s beautiful, and it’s big. Why didn’t you stay in another part of Mexico?” the document read.\n\nIn another hearing involving a 16-year old Venezuelan girl from Venezuela who had been a victim of child prostitution, an attorney alleged that Gonzalez scolded the child “not to engage in prostitution.”\n\nThe filing went on to note that despite these alleged practices by Gonzalez, she would “unexpectedly” grant children their petitions seeking Special Immigrant Juvenile Visas, but that she recently began denying the petitions without providing any reasoning in 2025.\n\nEstrella del Paso declined an interview request with KTSM and instead offered the following statement:\n\n“For nearly 40 years, Estrella del Paso has provided legal representation and other legal services to immigrants in El Paso. We are a non-profit law firm. As attorneys, we take our legal and ethical duties to our clients very seriously, and we file every motion and document with the court with these duties in mind. The motion filed includes several detailed examples that our legal team took time and detailed care to compile. For accuracy and completeness, we encourage you to refer directly to that filing. We will not comment on the motions or our interactions with the court. All our clients are owed a duty of confidentiality, and we will not violate this duty, especially in the case of vulnerable children.”\n\nGonzalez’s current term runs through 2028.",

    "description": "A Nicaraguan man who died at a troubled Texas detention camp days after he was detained by immigration agents in Minnesota appeared to have died by suicide, according to a 911 call and records released Wednesday.  Victor Manuel Diaz, 36, was found by guards on Jan. 14 in a room at Camp East Montana in El Paso, Texas, after he tried to die by suicide, a camp official reported on a 911 call obtained by The Associated Press through a public information request.  “They were doing rounds and they just found him with his pants tied up to his neck, I believe,” said the caller, who identified himself as a health administrator named Luis Gonzalez.",
    "fullText": "Victor Manuel Diaz, 36, was found by guards on Jan. 14 in a room at Camp East Montana in El Paso, Texas, after he tried to die by suicide, a camp official reported on a 911 call obtained by The Associated Press through a public information request.\n\n“They were doing rounds and they just found him with his pants tied up to his neck, I believe,” said the caller, who identified himself as a health administrator named Luis Gonzalez.\n\nDiaz’s death was at least the third of a detainee housed at Camp East Montana, which opened last year at Fort Bliss to hold 5,000 detainees in the desert near the U.S.-Mexico border. Advocates for detainees have alleged a pattern of violence, abuse and neglect at the camp. One earlier death has been ruled a homicide.\n\nRandall Kallinen, an attorney for Diaz's family, said they are suspicious of the claim that his death was a suicide because he was not depressed and would have been reunited with his mother, two sons and siblings in Nicaragua if he had been deported.\n\n“Even if it is suicide, was there something that happened to him that drove him to suicide?” Kallinen asked. “There still has to be an investigation.”\n\nMessages seeking comment were left with ICE on Wednesday.\n\nGonzalez did not witness Diaz's suicide attempt. A separate report by emergency medical services that was released Wednesday said Diaz was suspected of hanging himself with a bed sheet. Federal authorities have not released the findings of an autopsy, but have said the death was a “presumed suicide.”\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement picked up Diaz on Jan. 6 as agents fanned out across Minneapolis looking for people who may be in the country illegally. He was then sent to the sprawling Texas tent complex.\n\nDiaz crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in 2024, requested asylum and was released. A judge later ordered his removal after he didn’t show up for an immigration hearing, according to ICE.\n\nRelatives in Nicaragua lost contact with Diaz after he went to work at a suburban restaurant on Jan. 6 and later learned he'd been detained. They received a call on Jan. 15 from ICE saying Diaz was dead. Family members “were in disbelief,” said Carlos Morales, board president of Texas Nicaraguan Community, a nonprofit that helped the family raise money to repatriate Diaz's remains to Nicaragua.\n\nA coalition of groups and a Democratic congresswoman who represents El Paso have called for Camp East Montana to be closed.\n\nSome of those calls came after the Jan. 3 death of 55-year-old Cuba native Geraldo Lunas Campos. A medical examiner has ruled that a homicide, citing physical restraint by guards.\n\nA witness has described guards pinning Lunas Campos to the ground in handcuffs, with one restraining him in a chokehold until he could no longer breathe. ICE has said the guards intervened to try to help Lunas Campos after he attempted suicide, and that he resisted them. A camp official initially told police it was a suicide.\n\nLawyers for the family of Lunas Campos have asked a judge for an emergency order to prevent ICE from deporting detainees who witnessed the struggle.\n\nICE, which oversees the camp, announced Diaz’s death on Jan. 18, saying security staff “found Diaz unconscious and unresponsive in his room.” The agency said he “died of a presumed suicide” but that the cause was still under investigation.\n\nIn addition to Lunas Campos and Diaz, ICE announced that on Dec. 3 an immigrant from Guatemala held in Camp East Montana died after being transferred to a El Paso hospital for care. The agency said Francisco Gaspar-Andres, 48, was suspected to have died of liver and kidney failure.\n\nUnlike with the two prior deaths, Diaz’s body wasn’t sent to the county medical examiner in El Paso for an autopsy. Kallinen said an Armed Forces pathologist conducted the autopsy at Fort Bliss, and that he's been told it could take months for findings to be released.\n\nThe 911 caller in the case told the dispatcher that a team of doctors and nurses were working to try to revive Diaz after his suicide attempt and they needed an ambulance.\n\nParamedics found him laying on his back in a hospital bed without a heartbeat, according to an El Paso Fire Department incident report.\n\nAP reporter Michael Biesecker contributed from Washington.",

    "fullText": "HOUSTON (AP) — A Texas man who at one time escaped from custody and was on the run for three days after being sentenced to death for fatally shooting his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend nearly 27 years ago was scheduled on Wednesday to be the first person executed in the U.S. this year.\n\nCharles Victor Thompson was condemned for the April 1998 shooting deaths of his ex-girlfriend, Glenda Dennise Hayslip, 39; and her new boyfriend, Darren Keith Cain, 30, at her apartment in the Houston suburb of Tomball.\n\nThompson, 55, was scheduled to receive a lethal injection Wednesday evening at the state penitentiary in Huntsville.\n\nProsecutors say Thompson and Hayslip had been romantically involved for a year but split after Thompson “became increasingly possessive, jealous and abusive.”\n\nAccording to court records, Hayslip and Cain were dating when Thompson came to Hayslip’s apartment and began arguing with Cain around 3 a.m. the night of the killings. Police were called and told Thompson to leave the apartment complex. Thompson returned three hours later and shot both Hayslip and Cain, who died at the scene. Hayslip died in the hospital a week later.\n\n“The Hayslip and Cain families have waited over twenty-five years for justice to occur,” prosecutors with the Harris County District Attorney’s Office said in court filings.\n\nThompson’s attorneys have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stay his execution, arguing Thompson was not allowed to refute or confront the prosecution's evidence that concluded Hayslip died from a gunshot wound to the face. Thompson's attorneys have argued Hayslip actually died from flawed medical care she received after the shooting that resulted in severe brain damage sustained from oxygen deprivation following a failed intubation.\n\nThe Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles on Monday denied Thompson’s request to commute his death sentence to a lesser penalty.\n\n“If he had been able to raise a reasonable doubt as to the cause of Ms. Hayslip’s death, he would not be guilty of capital murder,” Thompson’s attorneys said in court filings with the Supreme Court.\n\nProsecutors said a jury has already rejected the claim and, concluded under state law that Thompson is responsible for Hayslip’s death because it “would not have occurred but for his conduct.”\n\nHayslip’s family had filed a lawsuit against one of her doctors, alleging medical negligence during her treatment left her brain-dead. A jury in 2002 found in favor of the doctor.\n\nThompson had his death sentence overturned and had a new punishment trial held in November 2005. A jury again ordered him to die by lethal injection.\n\nShortly after being resentenced, Thompson escaped from the Harris County Jail in Houston by walking out the front door virtually unchallenged by deputies. Thompson later told The Associated Press that after meeting with his attorney in a small interview cell, he slipped out of his handcuffs and orange jail jumpsuit and left the room, which was unlocked. Thompson waived an ID badge fashioned out of his prison ID card to get past several deputies.\n\n“I got to smell the trees, feel the wind in my hair, grass under my feet, see the stars at night. It took me straight back to childhood being outside on a summer night,” Thompson said about his three days on the run during a 2005 interview with the AP. He was arrested in Shreveport, Louisiana, while trying to arrange for wire transfers of money from overseas so he could make it to Canada.\n\nIf the execution is carried out, Thompson would be the first person put to death this year in the United States. Texas has historically held more executions than any other state, though Florida had the most executions in 2025, with 19.\n\nFollow Juan A. Lozano: https://x.com/juanlozano70",

    "description": "ESPN's Top 100 games during the 2025 season includes two memorable Texas A&M wins, while the CFP loss to Miami is ranked higher than expected.",
    "fullText": "Texas A&M's 2025 football season was a mixed bag for most of the fan base, but it was historic nonetheless, as second-year head coach Mike Elko and his veteran squad reeled off 11 consecutive wins, including road victories over Notre Dame, LSU, and Missouri.\n\nHowever, back-to-back losses to Texas in Austin and Miami in the first round of the College Football Playoff, the program's first postseason appearance was a major disappointment given the circumstances, the advantage of playing in Kyle Field, while starting quarterback Marcel Reed failed to connect on several throws that would have given the Aggies the lead.\n\nStill, the wind, which was even worse on the field, affected both teams, but thanks to a healthy running game, combined with Texas A&M's inability to stop the run late in the game, Miami running back Mark Fletcher racked up over 150 yards, leading to the Hurricanes finding the endzone, and ultimately winning the game 10-3. Yes, Miami made it all the way to the National Championship, but the Aggies had every chance to pull out the victory.\n\nCoupled with the insane comeback win over South Carolina, ESPN's Bill Connelly placed three of Texas A&M's memorable matchups on his top 100 games of the 2025 season, starting with the first-round playoff loss to Miami, which he surprisingly placed at No. 16, even though this was a slog fest before Miami's final drive in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"Maybe the most aesthetically ... unique game of the season. Before Miami could make a run to the CFP championship game, the Hurricanes had to survive impossibly windy conditions (and a strong Texas A&M defense) in College Station. Carson Beck threw for only 103 yards, and the teams combined to miss four of six field goal attempts. Malachi Toney lost a key fourth-quarter fumble, but a 56-yard Mark Fletcher Jr. run set up Toney's redemption moment -- an 11-yard jet sweep TD with 1:44 left. Texas A&M rallied, driving 70 yards in just 1:20, but Bryce Fitzgerald picked off a third-and-goal pass in the end zone, and Miami advanced.\"\n\nComing in at No. 11, Texas A&M's 31-30 win over South Carolina did not end up being the catalyst many of us thought it would be, but it will be remembered as one of the greatest comebacks of all time, regardless of how the season finished out. Trailing 30-3 at the half, the Aggies went from playing their worst football of the year to looking like an unstoppable force on both sides of the ball.\n\n\"It was the biggest comeback in Texas A&M history, without which the Aggies probably wouldn't have made the playoff. It was also a day that featured both the worst and best halves of Marcel Reed's career. In the first half, he completed only 6 of 19 passes with two terrible interceptions and two sacks, one of which produced a fumble returned for a score by Nick Barrett. LaNorris Sellers threw a 50-yard touchdown to Vandrevius Jacobs and an 80-yarder to Nyck Harbor (complete with a really strange interaction with a state trooper), and the Gamecocks cruised into halftime up 30-3.\n\nIn the second half, A&M woke up, and the Gamecocks clammed up. Reed went 16-for-20 for 298 yards and three third-quarter touchdowns -- 27 yards to Izaiah Williams, 39 to Ashton Bethel-Roman, 14 to Nate Boerkircher -- and the Aggies gained 371 yards while allowing 76. They needed only 20 minutes to take a 31-30 lead, and South Carolina could never mount a rally. It was the most strangely straightforward 27-point comeback you'll ever see.\"\n\nLastly, at No. 4, Texas A&M's most important win of the season was going on the road in Week 3 against a 0-1 Notre Dame team that had lost a close road battle against Miami the week prior.\n\nHaving not won a ranked non-conference road game in over 40 years, a botched snap on an extra point, paired with Marcel Reed driving the Aggies down the field, finding tight end Nate Boerkircher for the game-tying touchdown, was by far the most exciting moment of the 2025 season outside of Indiana winning its first national title.\n\n\"A botched PAT snap and hold might have made the difference in a playoff bid. Texas A&M led 28-24 after a wild first half, and after a reasonably tame third quarter, the action picked up again late. With the score tied at 34-34, Jeremiyah Love capped a 12-play, six-minute drive with a 12-yard touchdown, but a botched hold on the PAT left the Irish's lead at just six points. A third-down scramble from Marcel Reed and a defensive holding penalty gave A&M a first-and-goal, but that quickly became fourth-and-goal from the 11. No worries -- with 19 seconds left, Reed found Nate Boerkircher for the game-winner. (Well, I guess Randy Bond's PAT was the actual game winner, but still.)\"\n\nTexas A&M will open the 2026 season against Missouri State on Saturday, September 5.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions.

    "fullText": "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is ordering state agencies and public universities in Texas to halt H-1B hiring, the latest setback for foreign workers looking to work in the US.\n\nIn a letter to Texas state agency heads on Tuesday, Abbott wrote that there had been \"recent reports of abuse\" in the H-1B visa program, which is designed to bring high-skilled foreign workers to the US.\n\n\"Texas taxpayers invest billions to train our workforce,\" Abbott wrote on X. \"Those jobs should go to Texans.\"\n\nAbbott is also directing agencies and universities to provide information on how many petitions they submitted in 2025, how many visa holders they currently sponsor, their countries of origin, and more.\n\nThe freeze is set to last through May 2027, and includes exceptions for instances in which written permission from the Texas Workforce Commission is given.\n\n\"Rather than serving its intended purpose of attracting the best and brightest individuals from around the world to our nation to fill truly specialized and unmet labor needs, the program has too often been used to fill jobs that otherwise could—and should— have been filled by Texans,\" Abbott wrote.\n\nTexas has the second-most H-1B visa holders, trailing only California.\n\nAs of 2025, more than 40,000 beneficiaries were approved to work for more than 6,100 employers, according to data from US Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nAccording to that data, at least 1,200 H-1B visa holders work at various public universities in the state, including the University of Texas system, Texas A&M University, Texas Tech, and others.\n\nThe top employers for H-1B visa holders in Texas are IT companies and tech firms, including Oracle and Tesla.\n\nThe governor's directive comes as President Donald Trump's administration has upended the H-1B visa program more broadly.\n\nIn September, Trump moved to impose a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visas, initially causing chaos at some major tech companies amid confusion over whether that fee applies to current employees who leave the country.\n\nThe administration rolled out social media screening requirements for visa holders in December, leading some firms to warn their employees against traveling outside the country.\n\nH-1B visas have proven to be a divisive issue within Trump's coalition, with some — most notably Elon Musk — arguing that the US must continue to bring in foreign talent to remain globally competitive.\n\nProminent business leaders who previously worked in the US under an H-1B visa include Musk, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Arista Networks CEO Jayshree Ullal, and Jeffrey Skoll, the first president of eBay.",

    "fullText": "Tech chiefs waxed poetic about AI to delegates at Davos. Plus, the ‘human’ drama of AI startups and why Tesla is thriving in Texas\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. This week’s edition is a team effort: my colleague Heather Stewart reports on the plans for AI’s world domination at Davos; I examine how huge investments have followed AI companies with little to their names but drama and dreams; and Nick Robins-Early spotlights how lax regulation of autonomous driving in Texas allowed Tesla to thrive.\n\nWhen they weren’t discussing Donald Trump, delegates at the World Economic Forum last week were being dazzled by the prospects for artificial intelligence.\n\nUp and down the main street of the Swiss Alps town, almost every shopfront was temporarily emblazoned with the neon slogan of a tech firm – or a consultancy promising to tell executives how to incorporate AI into their business. Cloudflare’s wood-panelled HQ urged delegates to “connect, protect and build together”, and Wipro’s shouted: “Dream Solve Prove Repeat.”\n\nAt the conference, tech CEOs laid out their hopes for how the physical manifestations of AI will blanket the world in the coming years. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella told a rapt audience about how “token factories”, as he calls datacenters, will have to be distributed across the world, to diffuse the benefits of AI globally.\n\n“To me, a long term, scalable solution is to have all of these token factories part of the real economy connected to the grid, connected to the telco network – and that’s what will drive that scale, whether it’s in the global south, or in the developed world,” Nadella said.\n\nMeanwhile Google was showing off the latest iteration of its Google Glasses to excited delegates; and there were endless sessions in the Davos congress centre about the technology’s potential benefits – including a breathless chat with late addition to the schedule Elon Musk, though with the SpaceX IPO apparently looming, he was keenest to talk about going to Mars.\n\nAway from the glitzy shopfronts, though, there was significant concern being expressed that all this proves to be an epic bubble.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, DeepMind chief Demis Hassabis warned that some aspects of AI investment do look, “bubble-like”, but insisted that, “if the bubble bursts, we [ie Google, not society at large] will be fine”.\n\nNadella offered one test for how we would know if it is a bubble – which I didn’t find reassuring. “A tell-tale sign of this as a bubble, is if all we’re talking about are the tech firms,” he said.\n\nMuch of Silicon Valley has been captivated over the past week by a “very human drama”, as the Wall Street Journal put it. Thinking Machines Lab, a startup founded by former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati, fired her own chief technology officer, Barret Zoph, over a relationship with a colleague and a recent lack of productivity, per the Journal. Within hours, her ex-employee – along with one of her co-founders and a third employee – had reportedly signed offers with OpenAI, which they left just last year to join her startup. The three had told her they disagreed with the direction of the company in the meeting that ended with Zoph’s firing, according to the Journal. For his part, Zoph told the Journal that Murati had fired him simply for telling her he was considering another job.\n\nAs dishy as the drama might be, the stakes of Murati’s mess differ from a juicy celebrity entanglement that might be chronicled in TMZ or Page Six, two of my favorite publications. The stakes in San Francisco are billions of real dollars and more than $10bn potential ones. Murati’s company has raised $2bn in venture capital since its founding in February 2025. It is valued at $12bn. The talent involved in these California productions – not movies but rather AI tools used by hundreds of millions of people – takes on superstar significance.\n\nThinking Machines has released one product, Tinker, in October 2025, meant to streamline the customization of large language models, a rather niche concern in comparison with ChatGPT’s ambitions to replace Google search or Claude’s coding aptitude.\n\nThe massive investment and resulting valuation are chasing little in terms of real offerings from the company. A new company profiled in the New York Times last week, Humans&, has naught but a dream, an ugly website – and several hundred million dollars. Researchers from Google, Anthropic, and Elon Musk’s xAI, including one who helped develop the notorious Grok AI tool, founded the company just three months ago. They aim to facilitate collaboration between humans and machines rather than separation – “innovations in long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning, memory, and user understanding”, per the site. If that sounds gauzy, it is because the company has not launched a product.\n\nHumans& has raised $480m from Nvidia, Jeff Bezos, and Google, per the New York Times. It is valued at $4.48bn. It has – say it with me one more time – not launched a product.\n\nWhatever fears of an AI bubble may be circulating, the money is still flowing, chasing after the future with an enormous but uncertain bet in the present.\n\nElon Musk announced last week that Tesla had removed human safety monitors from its Robotaxis in Austin, Texas, as the company moves to expand its autonomous vehicle business. As with most things Musk, the reality was a bit more complicated – Tesla’s vice-president of software later clarified on X that the company had deployed “a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors”.\n\nWhat Tesla’s test-run of fully driverless vehicles did highlight, however, was the difference between how much leeway Texas gives autonomous vehicles compared with California, the birthplace of autonomous driving in the US and the home of the highest number of self-driving cars in the country. The Texas department of motor vehicles does not have regulatory authority over autonomous vehicles in the state, instead autonomous vehicles are governed by the state’s transportation code. Although a new government authorization system for autonomous vehicles is set to be implemented in the coming months, there’s currently no application process required for autonomous vehicle operators in the state. \n\n “Autonomous vehicles on Texas roads are subject to all traffic laws and can be cited for safety violations, but do not yet require specific authorization to operate,” the Texas DMV said.\n\nAlso surprising is the state’s lack of regulations on operating an autonomous vehicle if it’s for personal, non-commercial use. As long as it complies with some stipulations, such as traffic laws and safety standards, an autonomous vehicle can drive around Texas without anyone in the car.\n\n “Any motor vehicle equipped with an automated driving system may operate in this state,” the Texas transportation code states. “An automated motor vehicle may operate in this state with the automated driving system engaged, regardless of whether a human driver is physically present in the automated motor vehicle.”\n\nMeanwhile in California, the state’s department of motor vehicles requires three stages of testing and permitting for commercial autonomous vehicles. Regulators are also in the process of considering new rules that could add even more requirements on vehicle operators. Tesla caused confusion last October when Musk announced a ride-hailing service in the Bay Area, only for regulators to say that the company did not have authorization to operate paid or unpaid autonomous rides to the public. On the Robotaxi section of Tesla’s website, it only mentions Texas.",

This decision will be based on recruiting prowess, development background, and overall experience.\n\nAccording to Callaway, Mike Elko hoped to have a hire secured by this past weekend, but inclement weather across much of the country, including College Station, postponed recruiting visits, and the search for the new CB coach continues. While Elko has reportedly interviewed a host of candidates, including Georgia Tech defensive backs coach Cory Peoples, a name to watch has been kept under wraps.\n\nStill, Callaway stated that an announcement could and should be made this week, putting the finishing touches on a coaching staff that will lead the Aggies into the 2026 season. So far, the lone external hires are new tight ends coach Derek Shay, defensive line coach Elijah Robinson, and linebackers coach Travis Williams.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: On3's Jaxson Callaway provides update for Texas A&M's CB coach search",

    "fullText": "This past week was a weird one for upsets. We didn’t get any huge, unexpected upsets of top-tier teams. But we did have some small underdogs pull through on their opponent’s home floor, such as UNC beating Virginia, Texas Tech beating Houston, and Illinois beating Purdue. Let’s see what this week brings!\n\nThe Wildcats have sustained a lot of injuries in the past few weeks, but I don’t think that will matter in this one. We have seen that you beat Vanderbilt by using size and strength in the frontcourt, and this could be a breakout game for any of Malachi Moreno, Andrija Jelavic, or Mo Dioubate.\n\nThe Alabama Crimson Tide has a myriad of issues going on. Not only are they facing national scrutiny over the eligibility of Charles Bediako, but they also have injuries to Ajay Allen and Aden Holloway. I think there’s just too much going on with Alabama right now for them to be fully focused and engaged with this game, and Missouri has a breakout star emerging in T.O. Barrett.\n\nSean Miller’s Longhorns have shown that they have a high ceiling, coming off a 20-point win over a ranked Georgia team. Auburn has shown us a low floor, with a loss to Missouri already on the schedule. Miller has Dailyn Swain playing the best basketball of his career, and I think he plays a huge role as Texas continues their march to an NCAA Tournament bid in his first season.\n\nI’m going to hop back on my travel schedule soapbox here. Let’s get this straight: Florida State is not good. Cal is better. But FSU has Rodney McCray and Chauncey Wiggins, who both play well at home, and Cal has not won a game outside the state of California this season. I think the road trip gets the better of them here.\n\nSaint Louis is rolling right now — if not for a desperation 3-pointer at the buzzer by Stanford, the Billikens would be undefeated. But all good things must come to an end. The “Battle for the Archbaron’s Cup” has been anything but predictable over the years, and would make a great occasion for Dayton to pull off the upset. Dayton finally has their two centers, Amael L’Etang and Malcolm Thomas, healthy, and may also get back Jordan Derkack for this game.\n\nNFL: Super Bowl LX odds: Opening line for Patriots, Seahawks revealed\n\nCFB:Most impactful transfer of 2025 college football season\n\nNBA: NBA star Derrick Rose reacts after unexpected surprise ahead of jersey retirement\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: NFL’s crazy preseason Super Bowl LX graphic resurfaces\n\nTENNIS: Valentin Vacherot hits physics-defying shot at Australian Open\n\nVIRAL: Alex Honnold takes incredible selfie after historic Taipei 101 climb\n\nThe post Predicting upsets in College Basketball this week   appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "XTO Energy, an Exxon Mobil subsidiary, aims to sell its Eagle Ford shale assets in South Texas for nearly $1 billion, according to a report by Reuters.\n\nThe move would reportedly include over a thousand wells across 168,000 acres. Exxon operates some of the wells directly and holds a financial, non-operating interest in the others.\n\nA spokesperson for Exxon confirmed the news, but declined to confirm which assets would be included.\n\nTexas oil companies like Exxon are shedding assets as oil prices soften and production costs rise, pressuring producers to cut costs and increase drilling efficiency. Underground resources are also becoming harder to reach in domestic U.S. shale basins, forcing more companies to invest in assets outside the country.\n\nWINNERS & LOSERS: Trump promised an energy boom in his second term. Texas shows who actually got one\n\n\"This marketing decision is consistent with our strategy to continually evaluate and optimize our portfolio,\" the Exxon spokesperson said in an email.\n\nThe global oil giant based in Houston has focused its holdings in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. oil field, as well as in Guyana. The oil fields offshore Guyana, of which Exxon owns the largest stake, are considered among the most prolific oil discoveries of recent decades.\n\nThe Eagle Ford Shale is a rock formation in South Texas known for its significant oil and natural gas reserves.\n\nOther recent sales of Eagle Ford assets include Canadian producer BayTex Energy's $2.14 billion sale, which closed in December. Houston pipeline giant Kinder Morgan announced last week that it had solidified its own deal selling a $396 million stake in the area.\n\nThe oil and gas industry has seen a rush of layoffs over the last year, including from Exxon, as companies weather weak oil markets.\n\nExxon said in September it would lay off around 2,000 workers globally, though none of those layoffs are expected to include positions in the United States.\n\nThis article originally published at Eagle Ford on the chopping block as Exxon refocuses drilling strategy.",

    "fullText": "Alabama, Ole Miss, Tennessee and Texas A&M have emerged as the top four schools in the recruitment of Brentwood (Tenn.) Academy four-star safety Kenneth Simon II.\n\nThat’s no surprise, as he’s spoken about his interest in the quartet of programs with Rivals over the last few weeks. On Monday, he officially named them as his top four schools.\n\nSimon is the No. 226 overall prospect and No. 25 safety in the 2027 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all major recruiting media companies. He’s also the No. 10 recruit in Tennessee.\n\nWhen speaking with Rivals’ Sam Spiegelman earlier this month, Simon said that he was nearing his college commitment. He’s now made the next step and continues to work towards that decision.\n\n“It’s getting down to the wire,” Simon told Rivals. “I don’t know if it’ll be before or after (official visits). I have to talk about it with my family, but I’m close to the finish line. Checking out a few more details before I make the decision.”\n\nSimon, a Tennessee legacy, was back in Knoxville two weekends ago for the Vols’ junior day. He was then on A&M’s visit list over the weekend and is set to return to Tuscaloosa this weekend.\n\nAhead of competing at the Navy All-American Bowl earlier this month, Simon discussed his interest in his top four with Spiegelman:\n\nAlabama: “When you think of Alabama, you think of winning,” he started. “As long as I’ve been alive, they’ve been winning. The standard at ‘Bama — I wanna be a part of that standard. It’s held high and you always wanna go somewhere with a high standard. Coach (Kane) Womack and DeBoer, talking to them has been cool. They brought my family in and talked about my fit there, and it was fun.”\n\nOle Miss: “Coach (Jake) Schoonover saw me last year. He and I are real tight, and Coach (Jay) Shoop just got promoted. He used to work with my dad at Tennessee,” Simon said. “Pete Golding is smart and knows what he’s talking about when it comes to linebacker. Henry To’oto’o came from De La Salle High and played for Pete at Bama. He told me Coach Golding is one of the smartest dudes he ever sat in the meeting room with. Being around people like that, getting my ball knowledge up would help.”\n\nTennessee: “Coach Inge and I have a really good relationship. I grew up around Knoxville and Coach Inge is a great coach,” Simon said. “Coach (Josh) Heuepel is good at building relationships. Our relationship is very good. We talk about how I fit into their system schematically, and it’s everything I would wanna do in college, so I like that.”\n\nTexas A&M: “Coach Troop and I have a good relationship,” he said. “Coach (Mike) Elko is doing a great job, getting great players. Their recruiting class is insane right now. The defense is huge, it’s physical, and they play the right way. That’s what I like about A&M.”",

Fortunately for fans of American military and naval history, there are several U.S. battleships open to the public across the United States, where these classic vessels can be toured and appreciated.\n\nThe first of these museum battleships was the USS Texas (BB-35), which has been owned and operated by the State of Texas as a memorial since the late 1940s. With a history that predates other battleships like the Missouri and Iowa, the Texas is America's only surviving warship to have fought in both World Wars. And now, after years of uncertainty, the future of this historic vessel is looking bright, with work underway to move the ship to a new permanent home at the Port of Galveston.\n\nAnd when the new and improved USS Texas Museum opens, it won't just be displayed as an old and dilapidated relic. Instead, it will be a ship that will have undergone a thorough and costly $75 million restoration process to bring it back to its full, period-correct, World War II glory.\n\nMost of America's battleship museums are ships of the Iowa Class, which were commissioned during World War II and served into the 1990s. The Texas represents a much older era of battleships that played a pivotal role in both major theaters of World War II. Commissioned in 1914 as one of the U.S. Navy's two New York-class ships (which the Scientific American referred to as \"super dreadnoughts\"), the Texas quickly went into service supporting American interests during the Mexican Revolution. After the United States entered World War I, the Texas went to the North Sea, where it served as part of the historic Grand Fleet that oversaw the surrender of the Germans.\n\nThe Texas was modernized in the years between the wars, before again entering combat service in the Atlantic when World War II broke out. The USS Texas first supported the Allies during the North Africa campaign, then attacked German targets and supported the Allied Invasion force at Omaha Beach on D-Day in 1944. The ship would return to the U.S. for more modernizations before being sent to the Pacific Theater to fight the Japanese during the American invasions of Iwo Jima and Okinawa.\n\nFinally, the Texas ended its naval service by bringing American soldiers and sailors home during Operation Magic Carpet Ride in the months following the war. With newer battleships in the fleet and an increased focus on carriers, the aging ship was decommissioned and donated to the State of Texas in 1948.\n\nThe USS Texas was the first American battleship to become a permanent museum, located at the San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site. After decades on display and, with the ship's condition deteriorating, the Texas was moved to dry dock in 2022 to begin a series of repairs and renovations. Not only are these renovations addressing serious structural issues that would cause the ship to take on water, but the Texas is also receiving a full restoration with rebuilt structures, a new wooden deck, and fresh paint throughout to preserve the atmosphere of its combat days. So far, the process has required over 400,000 hours of labor, with over 700 tons of steel being replaced.\n\nWith the extensive four-plus-year restoration nearing completion at the start of 2026, the ship has secured its new home at Pier 15 in Galveston, where plans are underway for dredging, a permanent mooring, and brand new shoreside facilities to complete the museum. The Battleship Texas Foundation hopes to have the ship in place and the museum open to the public in late 2026 or early 2027. When the new and improved USS Texas Museum reopens, it will join the Aircraft Carrier USS Lexington Museum in Corpus Christi as one of the must-visit spots for military history on the Texas Gulf Coast.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "Ted Cruz trashed President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance in conversations with GOP donors last year, explosive leaked recordings allege.\n\nThe Texas senator, expected to run for president in 2028, slammed Trump’s tariff crusade and said he even threatened his staff with immediate firing if they used the phrase “Liberation Day” to refer to the day the sweeping taxes were announced, reports Axios.\n\nCruz, 55, told donors he and other senators expressed their tariff disgust with Trump in a lengthy phone call, warning it would tank the economy and lead to his impeachment. The call pushed past midnight and “did not go well,” Cruz told donors, with Trump “yelling” and “cursing” at the lawmakers.\n\nCruz claims that he received an especially explicit response from the president that night.\n\n“Mr. President, if we get to November of [2026] and people’s 401(k)s are down 30% and prices are up 10–20% at the supermarket, we’re going to go into Election Day, face a bloodbath,” Cruz told Trump, according to the recording. “You’re going to lose the House, you’re going to lose the Senate, you’re going to spend the next two years being impeached every single week.”\n\nTrump allegedly responded bluntly: “‘F--- you, Ted.’”\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nCruz’s office did not deny the contents of the recordings in a statement to Axios. Still, Cruz’s office claimed that he is still “the president’s greatest ally in the Senate and battles every day in the trenches to advance his agenda.”\n\nAxios reports that the recordings were “nearly 10 minutes in total” and came from conversations in “early and middle 2025.” The site said the recordings were provided by a “Republican source.”\n\nIt is unclear which donors Cruz was speaking to.\n\nTrump referred to Cruz as “Lyin’ Ted” in the 2016 GOP presidential primary and even went as far as suggesting that his wife, Heidi, is ugly compared to Melania. Still, Cruz has largely done Trump’s bidding in the Senate ever since, and he even campaigned for him in 2024.\n\nCruz, 55, is now believed to be eyeing another White House run, hoping to become a more traditional GOP successor to Trumpism. Standing in his way is the 41-year-old Vance, who is the overwhelming favorite to win the Republican nomination in the eyes of prediction markets.\n\nVance was “torched” by Cruz in the secret recordings, Axios reported. Sources also told The Washington Post last month that Cruz privately badmouths the VP to donors.\n\nIn the recordings obtained by Axios, Cruz claimed that Vance was a “pawn of conservative podcaster Tucker Carlson,” who is among Cruz’s biggest foes, having clashed with the ex-Fox News host in an explosive interview last summer over the Trump administration’s strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Cruz supported the intervention and has repeatedly criticized Carlson for his opposition to U.S. military support of Israel.\n\n“Tucker created JD,” Cruz told donors, according to Axios. “JD is Tucker’s protégé, and they are one and the same.”\n\nPublicly, Cruz has never explicitly linked Vance and Carlson. He alleged to donors that the ousted National Security Adviser Mike Waltz—of Signalgate infamy—was pushed out of Trump’s Cabinet by Carlson and Vance.\n\n“[He] supported being vigorous against Iran and bombing Iran—and Tucker and JD took Mike out,” Cruz said, according to Axios.\n\nCarlson told Axios he had nothing to do with the high-profile ouster.",

Ted Cruz traveled to Cancun in 2021 as a winter storm caused extended outages across the state.\n\nCruz was seen this week leaving Texas as reports of the winter storm's intensity grew.\n\nCruz returned to Texas Friday. He poked fun at social media chatter about the incident on his X account.\n\nI’ve returned home from my work trip. It’s 66 degrees & beautiful.

Chief of Emergency Services Scott Forster will oversee and coordinate the response,\" Jenkins' office said. \"Chief of Staff Lauren Trimble is empowered to sign orders, but the Governor's order makes that unnecessary.\"\n\nInformation in this story came from viewer photos and an email from Dallas County.",

    "description": "A 2-year-old girl was taken into ICE custody with her father on Thursday in Minneapolis and flown to Texas before she was returned to her mother Friday afternoon, a family lawyer said.",
    "fullText": "A 2-year-old girl was taken into ICE custody with her father on Thursday in Minneapolis and flown to Texas before she was returned to her mother Friday afternoon, a family lawyer said.\n\nThe child’s transfer to Texas took place despite a court order requiring her immediate release, according to the affidavit filed by the family attorney. The toddler’s father, identified as Elvis Tipan-Echeverria, remains in custody, the family’s attorney Kira Kelley told CNN Friday evening.\n\nThe father and daughter were on the same flight returning to Minnesota on Friday afternoon, Kelley said. “The child is out of detention as of this afternoon, and recovering from this horrific ordeal,” Kelley said.\n\nThe toddler and her father were initially being held at a federal facility in Minneapolis on Thursday after agents pursued their vehicle in a “targeted enforcement operation,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told CNN Friday. Lawyers for the family identified that facility as the Whipple Federal Building. The building has served as the backdrop of tense standoffs between agents and protesters following the death of Minneapolis resident Renee Good earlier this month.\n\nThe father and the toddler, identified only as C.R.T.V. in court documents, are citizens of Ecuador, and the child has lived in Minneapolis “since her arrival in the United States as a newborn” and has a pending asylum application.\n\nThe incident comes as outrage continues to grow over federal agents taking 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos in the driveway of his home in Minneapolis this week during the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in the state. The boy was later put on a plane with his father to a family detention facility in Texas, where they remain.\n\nDuring the encounter with Tipan-Echeverria and his daughter, DHS said the father was “driving erratically with a child in the vehicle.” The father would then park the vehicle when federal agents attempted to take him into custody; however, “he refused multiple lawful commands to open his door or lower his window,” the agency said.\n\nThe toddler and her father had just returned home from the store and were inside their vehicle when ICE agents entered the backyard and driveway area of the home “without a warrant,” the affidavit says. One agent “broke the glass on the window” of Tipan-Echeverria’s vehicle while the toddler was also inside before the father and daughter exited the car, the affidavit says.\n\nCNN has reached out to DHS to inquire about the removal of the father and toddler to Texas, and the claim that agents had taken both without a warrant.\n\nVideo from the incident, which took place just after 1 p.m., shows people surrounding armed and masked federal agents and what appeared to be a federal vehicle. One man was heard yelling, “They were carrying a child in that!” seemingly referring to the federal vehicle.\n\nSome of the people at the scene started backing away as federal agents deployed what seemed to be a chemical agent. As the federal agents drove away, protesters continued to yell at them. “Help him!” one person yelled out.\n\nRoughly 120 people “surrounded the agents blocking them in and preventing exit” during the arrest, DHS said. “Agitators in the crowd then began to throw rocks and garbage cans toward the agents and child,” prompting agents to deploy crowd control measures to “safely clear the area,” the statement continued.\n\nDHS noted that obstructing and assaulting law enforcement is a felony and federal crime.\n\nFederal agents attempted to give the child to the mother, “who was in the area, but she refused,” DHS claimed. Federal agents “took care of the child who the mother would not take,” before the father and child were “reunited” at a federal facility, DHS said.\n\nHowever, the family’s lawyer said the child’s mother was standing outside and was near her husband as the couple were “calling out to each other” and the father tried to bring the child to her mother, but ICE agents “would not allow” it, the affidavit said.\n\nUpon seeing ICE agents approach her, the mother stepped back inside the house and was “terrified,” according to the affidavit. At that point, the father and his child were placed in the back of an ICE vehicle, which “did not have a car seat,” the affidavit said.\n\nThe allegations from DHS about the girl’s mother refusing to take custody of her child echo a similar statement from the agency in the case of Liam, saying the boy’s mother also refused to take custody of him. But Liam’s mother, according to Pastor Sergio Amezcua, who has been helping her with the case, was “terrified” of the agents outside her door.\n\nIn the case of Tipan-Echeverria and his daughter, attorneys for the family said: “Needless to say, she has no criminal history,” in an emergency petition to immediately release the toddler from federal custody to Kelley, who signed a notarized delegation of parental authority with the mother and custodial guardian.\n\nThe court granted the petition to immediately release the child, transferring custody of her temporarily to the attorney “for the purpose of retrieving the infant from immigration detention,” by 9:30 p.m. Thursday, the court documents said.\n\nThe court order determined “the risk of irreparable harm to maintain child in custody under the circumstances described in the pleadings are overwhelming.”\n\nThe father and his child were on a commercial airline flight to Texas by 8:30 p.m. that same day, despite the order issued at 8:11 p.m. that they should not be removed from Minnesota, their lawyer said in the affidavit, citing a conversation with a DHS counsel.\n\nThe agency then told the family’s attorney that it would fly the child back to Minnesota on Friday, the affidavit says. Kelley, the family lawyer, said she had not been able to contact her clients since they were taken into custody, according to the affidavit.\n\nA federal court order has barred ICE from sending the father outside of Minnesota while court proceedings play out, Kelley’s statement said.",

Ted Cruz (R-TX) pushed back on critics pouncing on him over an image of the senator on a plane to California just days before Texas is set to get hit with a major winter storm.\n\n“Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was spotted earlier today, January 20, 2026, on a plane heading to Laguna Beach as the state of Texas braces for a rare ice threat and arctic cold front,” political strategist Shea Jordan Smith wrote on X this week.\n\nIncluded was an image of Cruz on his flight. The post itself has more than eight million views as of Thursday.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was spotted earlier today, January 20, 2026, on a plane heading to Laguna Beach as the state of Texas braces for a rare ice threat and arctic cold front. pic.twitter.com/lVTcqP8LR4\n\n— Shea Jordan Smith (@shea_jordan) January 21, 2026\n\nCruz’s office later put out a statement, dismissing criticism and explaining that Cruz was on a pre-planned trip and he’ll actually be returning to the Lone Star State before the storm is projected to hit.\n\n“Senator Cruz is currently on pre-planned work travel that was scheduled weeks in advance. He will be back in Texas before the storm is projected to hit,” a spokesperson for the senator said in a statement, first shared with KHOU.\n\nMultiple critics invoked another moment from Cruz’s career where he went viral and earned plenty of mockery. In February 2021, Cruz was heavily criticized after took a trip to Cancun, Mexico, while Texas was hit with the deadly Winter Storm Uri.\n\nThe senator returned to Texas at the time and admitted his trip was “obviously a mistake.”\n\n“It was obviously a mistake, and in hindsight, I wouldn’t have done it,” he said.\n\nThe latest storm is expected to stretch across 2,000 miles eventually, while it’ll begin in Texas and Oklahoma. Heavy snowfall and freezing rain are expected to begin Friday, hitting northern Texas and cities like Dallas and Houston. The storm will eventually move its way to the East Coast.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott (R) has declared a state of emergency in his state over the approaching harsh weather.\n\n“Based on current forecasts, the State of Texas is acting to ensure Texans have the resources they need before severe winter weather impacts communities across Texas,” the governor announced this week. “I thank emergency management personnel and first responders for working tirelessly to keep Texans safe.”\n\nThe post Ted Cruz Bites Back at Critics Furious Over His Leaving Texas Ahead of Major Winter Storm first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "A Cuban migrant held in solitary confinement at an immigration detention facility in Texas died after guards held him down and he stopped breathing, according to an autopsy report released Wednesday that ruled the death a homicide.  Geraldo Lunas Campos died Jan. 3 following an altercation with guards.  U.S.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A Cuban migrant held in solitary confinement at an immigration detention facility in Texas died after guards held him down and he stopped breathing, according to an autopsy report released Wednesday that ruled the death a homicide.\n\nGeraldo Lunas Campos died Jan. 3 following an altercation with guards. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said the 55-year-old father of four was attempting suicide and the staff tried to save him.\n\nBut a witness told The Associated Press last week that Lunas Campos was handcuffed as at least five guards held him down and one put an arm around his neck and squeezed until he was unconscious.\n\nHis death was one of at least three reported in little more than a month at Camp East Montana, a sprawling tent facility in the desert on the grounds of Fort Bliss, an Army base.\n\nThe autopsy report by the El Paso County Medical Examiner’s Office found Lunas Campos' body showed signs of a struggle, including abrasions on his chest and knees. He also had hemorrhages on his neck. The deputy medical examiner, Dr. Adam Gonzalez. determined the cause of death was asphyxia due to neck and torso compression.\n\nThe report said witnesses saw Lunas Campos “become unresponsive while being physically restrained by law enforcement.” It did not elaborate on what happened during the struggle but cited evidence of injuries to his neck, head and torso associated with physical restraint. The report also noted the presence of petechial hemorrhages — tiny blood spots from burst capillaries that can be associated with intense strain or injury — in the eyelids and skin of the neck.\n\nDr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist who reviewed the autopsy report for AP, said the presence of petechiae in the eyes support the conclusion that asphyxia caused the death. Those injuries suggest pressure on the body and are often associated with such deaths, he said.\n\nHe said the contusions on Lunas Campos’ body may reflect physical restraint and the neck injuries were consistent with a hand or knee on the neck.\n\nThe autopsy also found the presence of prescription antidepressant and antihistamine medications, adding that Lunas Campos had a history of bipolar disorder and anxiety. It made no mention of him attempting suicide.\n\nGovernment provided changing accounts of what happened\n\nICE's initial account of the death, which included no mention of an altercation with guards, said Lunas Campos had become disruptive and staff moved him into a cellblock where detainees are held away from others.\n\n“While in segregation, staff observed him in distress and contacted on-site medical personnel for assistance,” the agency said in its Jan. 9 statement. “Medical staff responded, initiated lifesaving measures, and requested emergency medical services.”\n\nLunas Campos was pronounced dead after paramedics arrived.\n\nLast Thursday, after Lunas Campos' family was first informed the death was likely to be ruled a homicide, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin amended the government's account, saying he had attempted suicide and guards tried to help him.\n\n“Campos violently resisted the security staff and continued to attempt to take his life,” she said. “During the ensuing struggle, Campos stopped breathing and lost consciousness.”\n\nAfter the final autopsy report was released Wednesday, McLaughlin issued a statement emphasizing that Lunas Campos was “a criminal illegal alien and convicted child sex predator.”\n\nNew York court records show Lunas Campos was convicted in 2003 of sexual contact with a person under 11, a felony for which he was sentenced to one year in jail and placed on the state’s sex offender registry. Lunas Campos was also sentenced to five years in prison and three years of supervision in 2009 after being convicted of attempting to sell a controlled substance, according to the New York corrections records. He completed the sentence in January 2017.\n\n“ICE takes seriously the health and safety of all those detained in our custody,\" McLaughlin said Wednesday, adding that the agency was investigating the death. DHS has not responded to questions about whether any outside law enforcement agency was also investigating.\n\nDeaths put a spotlight on Camp East Montana\n\nThe AP reported in August that the $1.2 billion contract to build and operate Camp East Montana, expected to become the largest detention facility in the U.S., was awarded to a private contractor headquartered in a single-family home in Richmond, Virginia. The company, Acquisition Logistics LLC, had no prior experience running a corrections facility and has subcontracted with other companies to help operate the camp.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the guards present when Lunas Campos died were government employees or those of a private contractor.\n\nA final determination of homicide by the medical examiner would typically be critical in determining whether any guards are held criminally or civilly liable. The fact that Lunas Campos died on an Army base could limit state and local officials’ legal jurisdiction to investigate.\n\nLunas Campos was among the first detainees sent to Camp Montana East, arriving in September after ICE arrested him in Rochester, New York, where he lived for more than two decades. He was legally admitted to the U.S. in 1996, part of a wave of Cuban immigrants seeking to reach Florida by boat.\n\nICE said he was picked up in July as part of a planned immigration enforcement operation due to criminal convictions that made him eligible for removal.\n\nIn addition to Lunas Campos, ICE announced that on Dec. 3 an immigrant from Guatemala held in Camp East Montana died after being transferred to a El Paso hospital for care. While the cause of death was still pending, the agency said Francisco Gaspar-Andres, 48, was suspected to have died of liver and kidney failure.\n\nOn Sunday, ICE announced that Victor Manuel Diaz, a 36-year-old immigrant from Nicaragua, died at Camp East Montana on Jan. 14 of a “presumed suicide.” The agency said Diaz was detained by ICE earlier this month during the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.\n\nUnlike with the two prior deaths, Diaz's body wasn't sent to the county medical examiner in El Paso. McLaughlin said Wednesday that the autopsy for Diaz is being performed at the Army medical center at Fort Bliss. DHS again did not respond to questions about whether any agency other than ICE will investigate the death.\n\nRep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes El Paso, called on DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and acting ICE Director Todd M. Lyons to brief Congress about the recent deaths.\n\n“DHS must preserve all evidence — including halting their effort to deport the witnesses,” Escobar said Wednesday. “I reiterate my call for Camp East Montana to be shut down and for the contract with the corporation running it to be terminated.”",

The officers then told him to knock on the door to his home to see if other people were inside, “essentially using a 5-year-old as bait,\" she said.\n\nStenvik said the family has an active asylum case and has not been ordered to leave the country.\n\n“Why detain a 5-year-old?” she asked. \"You cannot tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal.”\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that “ICE did NOT target a child.”\n\nShe said Immigration and Customs Enforcement was conducting an operation to arrest the child’s father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, who McLaughlin said is from Ecuador and in the U.S. illegally. He fled on foot, “abandoning his child,” she said.\n\n“For the child’s safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended Conejo Arias,” McLaughlin said, adding that parents are given the choice to be removed with their children or have them placed with a person of their choosing.\n\nStenvik said another adult who lives at the home was outside when the father and son were taken, but agents wouldn't leave Liam with that person. DHS didn't immediately respond to an email Thursday asking if Conejo Arias had asked to keep his son with him.\n\nLiam and his father were being held in a family holding cell in Texas, Marc Prokosch, the family’s lawyer, said during the news conference.\n\n“Every step of their immigration process has been doing what they’ve been asked to do,” Prokosch said of the family's asylum claim. “So this is just cruelty.”\n\nMinnesota has become a major focus of immigration sweeps by DHS-led agencies. Greg Bovino, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection official who has been the face of the crackdowns in Minneapolis and other cities, said 3,000 “of some of the most dangerous offenders” have been arrested in Minnesota in the last six weeks.\n\nJulia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said advocates have no way of knowing whether the government’s arrest numbers and descriptions of the people in custody are accurate.\n\nLiam is the fourth student from Columbia Heights Public Schools who has been detained by ICE in recent weeks, said Stenvik. A 17-year-old student was taken Tuesday while heading to school, and a 10-year-old and a 17-year-old have also been taken, she said.\n\nThe district is made up of five schools and about 3,400 students from pre-K to 12th grade, according to its website. The majority of the students come from immigrant families, according to Stenvik.\n\nShe said they've noticed their attendance drop over the past two weeks, including one day where they had about one-third of their students out from school.\n\nElla Sullivan, Liam’s teacher, described him as “kind and loving.”\n\n“His classmates miss him,” she said. \"And all I want is for him to be safe and back here.”\n\nThis story was updated to correct Greg Bovino's title to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection offical, not Patrol.",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M baseball head coach Michael Earley's roster continues to garner national preseason accolades entering his second year at the helm in College Station.\n\nAccording to Perfect Game USA's Top Players by Class list, six Aggies were recognized as some of the best players in college baseball in their respective classes. It includes juniors Caden Sorrell, Chris Hacopian, Gavin Grahovac, and Shane Sdao, sophomore Terrence Kiel II, and freshman Nico Partida. After losing many top contributors to the MLB Draft in the spring of 2025, Earley reloaded well in the transfer portal and maintained decent roster retention.\n\nTexas A&M will look to put last year's woes behind it and turn the page to a new chapter in 2026. To accomplish that feat, it will take talent like Perfect Game USA's Aggie selections to contribute and stay healthy throughout the upcoming season.\n\nSee which Aggies made the @PerfectGameUSA Top Players by Class list this season 🔝 👀#GigEm pic.twitter.com/xOnyFyp13w\n\n— Texas A&M Baseball (@AggieBaseball) January 21, 2026\n\nThe Maroon and White stood atop the national preseason rankings before last season's first pitch, but it didn't last long. While Texas A&M's roster suffered many injuries to open last year's efforts, the team's underwhelming performances led to the Aggies becoming the first preseason No. 1 to miss the postseason since 1991. As a result, some national journalists, such as Baseball America's Jacob Rudner, have avoided ranking the program in the top 25.\n\n\"So, what’s the holdup? The decision to hold Texas A&M out is rooted entirely in last season’s outcome. A year ago, a similarly talented roster opened the season ranked No. 1 and missed the NCAA Tournament altogether. Michael Earley retooled his staff this offseason and early returns have been positive, but until the Aggies translate that talent into consistent results, the benefit of the doubt is withheld. The expectation is not whether Texas A&M belongs in the rankings, but whether or not it will prove it does,\" Rudner said.\n\nTexas A&M's first pitch of 2026 is scheduled for Friday, Feb. 13, against the Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles in College Station. Game 1 is set for 6 p.m., with Games 2 and 3 scheduled for 2 p.m. CT on Saturday, February 14, and 12 p.m. CT on Sunday, February 15, respectively.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Dylan on X: @dylanmflippo.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M baseball's 2026 roster racking up preseason accolades",

    "description": "Cougar Nation should be mighty proud of what its women’s basketball squad accomplished Wednesday night.",
    "fullText": "Thanks to recent football and men’s basketball matchups which all resulted in losses, BYU fans have learned to really loathe Texas Tech.\n\nThus, Cougar Nation should be mighty proud of what its women’s basketball squad accomplished Wednesday night.\n\nBYU scored a 73-61 upset victory over the No. 19-ranked Lady Raiders at the Marriott Center, toppling the Big 12’s top team for Lee Cummard’s first ranked win at the helm of the Cougars’ program.\n\n“I’m just really proud of the group and glad to see their hard work paying off and be rewarded for how close of a group it is, and how hard they work and prepare for these games,” Cummard told reporters after the win. “(We) had a great couple days of practice, great shoot around this morning. I just want (the players) to know that, you know, they’re a really good team and they’re rewarded for that tonight.”\n\nBYU trailed for less than a minute to open the night before quickly pulling ahead and never looking back, leading by as many as 17 points against a Texas Tech team that had yet to lose on the road and was 19-1 prior to arriving in Provo.\n\n“I felt like at least tonight, regardless of who they have, our five were more connected and tighter as a group, and we were the better five on the court,” Cummard said.\n\nThe Cougars shot a collective 47.3% from the field and 44.4% from 3-point range — a far cry from their previous season average of 29.7% — while feasting down low for 36 paint points.\n\nshots are fallin' ☔️\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/HaKZkEFic9\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\nBest exemplifying BYU’s fight was center Lara Rohkohl, who finished with 15 points, eight rebounds and a game-high plus/minus of +15, refusing to let the ultra-physical Lady Raiders push her around in the post.\n\n“They were a little aggressive down there, but you know, we stood against it and we did a good job down there,” Rohkohl said. “The guards were giving me perfect passes into my hands, and I just had to go up and finish it.”\n\nFeeding Rohkohl often was star sophomore point guard Delaney Gibb, who fought through double teams for 18 points, five rebounds and six assists while swiping four steals on the defensive end of the floor.\n\nAutomatic🔥\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/E5ruG3c7mP\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\n“I know that if I’m getting hounded and double-teamed, I can kick to shooters and pass to Lara and they’re gonna make plays out of it,” Gibb said. “And so I think we played super connected tonight and just moved the ball really well, which opened up great looks for us.”\n\nSome of that ball movement came from Rohkohl, who cashed in two assists by kicking outside to Gibb for a pair of 3-pointers.\n\nBullseye Delaney🎯\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/Dn4lsb6UJ6\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\n“Being in the paint and kicking out to a 3, in my opinion, is the best shot that there is,” Gibb said. “It’s really easy to make, all your momentum is going to the hoop. (Rohkohl) was fighting hard in the paint, and so for her to unselfishly spray out to shooters on the outside is never going to go unnoticed.”\n\nBYU’s leading scorer was freshman guard Olivia Hamlin, who put up the best performance of her young career — especially considering the competition — by posting 20 points of 9 of 15 shooting with four rebounds and two steals.\n\nEleven of Hamlin’s 20 points came in the first quarter to set the tone for the remainder of the contest, and she ended the night with six fourth quarter points to help bury Texas Tech for good.\n\n🤯🤯🤯\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/XSatpyvczA\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\n“She was on it from the jump,” Cummard said of Hamlin. “... Tonight it was hard to keep her off the court. She was hugely impactful on the defensive end with those steals early, but even late, just with constant pressure.\n\n“People have a really hard time going around her, and people have a really hard time keeping her in front. (She is a) huge, huge asset to the group every game, but tonight she just brought it, you know, played with force and made plays for the group.”\n\nDefensively, BYU was outstanding, holding the Lady Raiders to 33.3% shooting and scoring 24 points off of 21 forced turnovers. The Cougars clamped down hardest in the fourth quarter, allowing just three makes on 16 field goal attempts.\n\nROBBED 'EM🤯\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/Jl3Aw4Ioyr\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\n“It was the most connected we’ve been all year defensively,” Cummard said. “We’ve been a pretty good defensive team, you know, visually, but also metrically speaking.\n\n“... I just thought that we minimized some of the lapses that we’ve had in some of our losses. ... It shows growth in what we’re doing, but just overall, the connectivity on that (defensive) end was really, really good as a group.”\n\nWith the win, BYU is now 15-4 on the campaign and has already matched last year’s mark of four victories in Big 12 play — a number Cummard’s Cougars will certainly increase given their 11 remaining conference contests, along with the newfound confidence from toppling a team such as Texas Tech.\n\n“I feel like we’ve had a pretty tough schedule thus far, and so it’s kind of like a breath of air (to win),” Gibb said. “I feel like this game is going to bring so much confidence to our team. We have a ton of young players, some of which this is their first year of college basketball, and so I think this kind of just reminds us that we can compete at the highest level.

The storm arriving late this week and into the weekend is shaping up to be a “widespread potentially catastrophic event from Texas to the Carolinas,” said Ryan Maue, a former chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

    "fullText": "ATLANTA (AP) — With many Americans still recovering from multiple blasts of snow and unrelenting freezing temperatures in the nation’s northern tier, a new storm is set to emerge this weekend that could coat roads, trees and power lines with devastating ice across a wide expanse of the South.\n\nThe storm arriving late this week and into the weekend is shaping up to be a “widespread potentially catastrophic event from Texas to the Carolinas,” said Ryan Maue, a former chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\n“I don’t know how people are going to deal with it,” he said.\n\nForecasters on Tuesday warned that the ice could weigh down trees and power lines, triggering widespread outages.\n\n“If you get a half of an inch of ice — or heaven forbid an inch of ice — that could be catastrophic,” said Keith Avery, CEO of the Newberry Electric Cooperative in South Carolina.\n\n‘Great swaths’ of heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain expected\n\nThe National Weather Service warned of \"great swaths of heavy snow, sleet, and treacherous freezing rain” starting Friday in much of the nation’s midsection and then shifting toward the East Coast through Sunday.\n\nTemperatures will be slow to warm in many areas, meaning ice that forms on roads and sidewalks might stick around, forecasters say.\n\nThe exact timing of the approaching storm — and where it is headed — remained uncertain on Tuesday. Forecasters say it can be challenging to predict precisely which areas could see rain and which ones could be punished with ice.\n\nCold air clashing with rain to fuel a 'major winter storm’\n\nAn extremely cold arctic air mass is set to dive south from Canada, setting up a clash with the cold temperatures and rain that will be streaming eastward across the southern U.S.\n\n“This is extreme, even for this being the peak of winter,” National Weather Service meteorologist Bryan Jackson said of the cold temperatures.\n\nWhen the cold air meets the rain, the likely result will be “a major winter storm with very impactful weather, with all the moisture coming up from the Gulf and encountering all this particularly cold air that’s spilling in,” Jackson said.\n\nAn atmospheric river could set up across the southern U.S.\n\nAn atmospheric river of moisture could be in place by the weekend, pulling precipitation across Texas and other states along the Gulf Coast and continuing across Georgia and the Carolinas, forecasters said.\n\n“Global models are painting a concerning picture of what this weekend could look like, with an increasingly strong signal for ice storm potential across North Georgia and portions of central Georgia,” according to the National Weather Service's Atlanta office.\n\nIf significant accumulations of ice strike metro Atlanta, it could be a problem through the weekend since low temperatures early Monday are expected to be around 22 degrees (minus 5.6 Celsius) in Atlanta. The city's high temperature on Monday is forecast to be around 35 degrees (1.7 Celsius).\n\nHighway and air travel could be tangled by the storm\n\nTravel is a major concern, as southern states have less equipment to remove snow and ice from roads, and extremely cold temperatures expected after the storm could prevent ice from melting for several days. In Michigan, more than 100 vehicles crashed into each other or slid off an interstate southwest of Grand Rapids on Monday.\n\nThe storm is also expected to impact many of the nation’s major hub airports, including those in Dallas; Atlanta; Memphis, Tennessee; and Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nPolar air from Canada to keep northern states in a deep freeze\n\nUnusually cold temperatures are already in place across much of the northern tier of the U.S., but the blast of arctic air expected later this week “will be the coldest yet,” Jackson said.\n\n“There’s a large sprawling vortex of low pressure centered over Hudson Bay,” Jackson said of the sea in northern Canada that’s connected to the Arctic Ocean. “And this is dominating the weather over all of North America.”\n\nTexas could be a harbinger for other parts of the South\n\nSome of the storm’s earliest impacts could be in Texas on Friday, as the arctic air mass slides south through much of the state, National Weather Service forecaster Sam Shamburger said in a briefing on the storm.\n\n“At the same time, we’re expecting rain to move into much of the state,” Shamburger said.\n\nLow temperatures could fall into the 20s or even the teens in parts of Texas by Saturday, with the potential for a wintery mix of weather in the northern part of the state.\n\nForecasters cautioned that significant uncertainty remains, particularly over how much ice or snow could fall across north and central Texas.\n\n“It’s going to be a very difficult forecast,” Shamburger said.\n\nAt an Arkansas hardware store, customers gear up for storm\n\nIn Little Rock, Arkansas, a steady stream of customers on Tuesday were stocking up on supplies at Fuller and Son Hardware.\n\n“Right now parents of young children are getting sleds,” said James Carter, the company’s director of operations.\n\nPeople were also getting shovels, ice-melting products and covers for outside faucets to keep them from freezing, since low temperatures in the Little Rock area are forecast to fall into the teens, he said.\n\nPanjwani reported from Washington.

    "description": "When will Jayden Quaintance return?",
    "fullText": "The Kentucky Wildcats have won three straight games in SEC play and are now 3-2 in league play. Last week, they earned hard-fought road wins at LSU and Tennessee. Kentucky is now 29th in the AP Poll, having received the fourth-most votes of teams just outside the Top 25.\n\nUnfortunately, the Wildcats will have to continue winning without big man Jayden Quaintance. Head coach Mark Pope announced on Tuesday that Quaintance will miss Wednesday’s matchup with the Texas Longhorns.\n\n“He will not play tomorrow night, but he’s making progress,” Pope said at his Tuesday press conference. “We’re super optimistic (about Quaintance playing again this season), and he’s kind of going through the process, and hopefully he’ll be back soon. I know that’s not very descriptive, but I’m trying to be protective of him also.”\n\nIt’s great that there is optimism that Quaintance can return this season. He does add something to this team, and that can matter in February and March.\n\nQuaintance is a really good rebounder and shot blocker. His presence makes Kentucky’s defense better. However, he’s not much of an offensive threat just yet. He can become one, and his defensive prowess is really intriguing.\n\nKentucky put up a valiant effort against Tennessee on the board Saturday with Quaintance out. That shows this team can win even as Quaintance deals with swelling in his knee, which has kept him out since the Missouri game.\n\nThe Wildcats host Texas on Wednesday, a team that averages over 86 points per game. Kentucky weathered the storm without Quaintance on Saturday against a big Tennessee team. They’ll have to do so again on Wednesday against the Longhorns, and likely Saturday as well when they host Ole Miss.",

    "fullText": "Records are meant to be broken, and the Texas A&M Aggies wasted no time proving it at the Corky Classic in Lubbock. Several members of the Aggie Track & Field program made history over the weekend, setting the tone for what could be a special indoor campaign.\n\nTexas A&M opened the season with force, stacking up 39 top‑ten finishes, 19 medalists, and multiple athletes climbing the program’s all‑time performer lists.\n\nThe first breakthrough came from senior thrower Henry Zimmerman, who delivered a school‑record performance in the weight throw. His final attempt—21.88m (71‑9.5)—secured second overall and made him the top collegiate finisher in the field.\n\nFreshman pole vaulter Lily Carlson followed with a statement of her own. Competing in just her second collegiate meet, Carlson cleared 4.41m (14‑5.5) to break the Texas A&M indoor record previously held by All‑American Heather Abadie. She claimed gold with a dominant seven‑inch margin over the next closest competitor.\n\nThe record‑setting weekend wrapped on the final day when freshman distance runner Peter Narumbe delivered one of the fastest 1,000m races in NCAA history. His time of 2:19.88 not only broke Luca Santorum’s school record—it also stands as the 17th‑fastest 1,000m ever recorded at the collegiate level. His gold‑medal finish ranks him third all‑time among NCAA freshmen.\n\nWhile Texas A&M is traditionally known for its outdoor prowess, this year’s squad has the depth and talent to be a real factor indoors and in the SEC race. The Aggies return to action on January 25, hosting the Ted Nelson Invitational at the Fasken Indoor Track & Field facility.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes, and opinions.

    "fullText": "SAN ANGELO, Texas (Concho Valley Homepage) — The Rams and Rambelles stay home for a midweek matchup versus Texas A&M-Kingsville.\n\nThe Angelo State Rams and Rambelles are set to host Lone Star Conference rival Texas A&M-Kingsville in back-to-back games. Before the matchups tip off on Wednesday night, both teams have lots to build on following last week’s performances.\n\nHead coach Alesha Ellis and the Rambelles split their home series last week, losing to UT Permian Basin and defeating UT Dallas. The biggest difference in the second game revolves around ball distribution. Four different Rambelles reached double figures in the same game, led by Taylor Grona and Majik Esquivel with 16 and 14 points, respectively. The key going forward is continued ball distribution along with primary leadership, especially among the two young athletes.\n\n“[Grona and Esquivel] are some of the best competitors that I’ve ever coached,” Ellis said. “Taylor has done such a great job and so has Majik. They’re only sophomores this year, so they’re pretty young. They come to practice every day willing to get better, and they’re the ones asking how to get better.”\n\nOn the Rams’ side, the injury bug continues. Limited player availability is a disadvantage anytime, but the Rams refuse to go down without a fight. Angelo State comes off a win over UT Permian Basin and loss to UT Dallas. The biggest difference in those games was UT Dallas’ zone defense displayed in the second half, something head coach Vinay Patel’s squad wasn’t previously accustomed to.\n\n“We just have not seen a ton of zone this year, [so it was] probably smart on [UT Dallas’] part to zone us,” Patel said. “Some of our top three-point shooters have been out with injury, but it’s the first time that we’ve seen a predominant zone for an entire half. I thought it became contagious when we started missing shots. We spent the weekend working on our zone attack, making sure we’re ready if we see it again and try to figure some different things out.”",

The federal investigation into his death continues.\n\nIt's the same facility where ICE said another detainee died earlier this month as staff members tried to keep him from killing himself. But a fellow detainee said at least five officers were restraining the handcuffed inmate and at least one had an arm around his neck.\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE — This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988.\n\nDiaz was swept up on Jan. 6 in the federal crackdown on immigration in Minnesota and sent to Texas, ICE said.\n\nDiaz entered the United States in March 2024 and Border Patrol officers took him into custody, He was released on parole pending a court date and a judge ordered him to leave the U.S. in an August hearing that Diaz did not attend, ICE said.\n\nDiaz was given a final order for removal on Jan. 12, two days before he was found unconscious in his room, authorities said.\n\nICE did not release any other details on Diaz's death. The agency notifies Congress and releases a statement on its website of all in-custody deaths.\n\nDiaz, 36, was being held at Camp Montana East where ICE said another detainee, Geraldo Lunas Campos, died as staff members tried to prevent him from killing himself.\n\nBut a preliminary investigation by the El Paso County Medical Examiner’s Office found Lunas Campos, 55, died from asphyxia from chest and neck compression and said the death would likely be classified a homicide.\n\nA fellow detainee told the AP that Lunas Campos was handcuffed and refused to go back into his cell when at least five guards pinned him to the floor. The detainee said at least one of the guards squeezed an arm around Lunas Campos' neck.\n\nICE said it is still investigating that death.",

    "description": "Many U.S. states are planning bitcoin strategic reserves, and other forms of crypto financing, showing budgets are buying into the digital assets trend.",
    "fullText": "Led by Texas and New Hampshire, U.S. states across the national map, both red and blue in political stripes, are developing bitcoin strategic reserves and bringing cryptocurrencies onto their books through additional state finance and budgeting measures.\n\nTexas recently became the first state to purchase bitcoin after a legislative effort that began in 2024, but numerous states have joined the \"Reserve Race\" to pass legislation that will allow them to ultimately buy cryptocurrencies.\n\nNew Hampshire passed its crypto strategic reserve law last May, even before Texas, giving the state treasurer the authority to invest up to 5% of the state funds in crypto ETFs, though precious metals such as gold are also authorized for purchase. Arizona passed similar legislation, while Massachusetts, Ohio, and South Dakota have legislation at various stages of committee review.\n\nDespite much of the legislation being largely sponsored or co-sponsored by Republicans, the adoption of crypto at the state level is not expected to strictly fall along party lines. The 2024 election cycle was the first time that the cryptocurrency industry played a major role in lobbying in both state and national elections. In fact, it was the largest corporate donor in an election cycle, with support given to candidates on both sides. It is already amassing a war chest for the 2026 midterms.\n\nCongress is currently debating a crypto market structure bill, and state-level politicians are as much out to prove that they, and their states, won't be left out of the digital assets boom. Justin Marlowe, a public policy professor at the University of Chicago, sees the state-level trend as largely one of signaling at present. \"If you're a governor and you want to broadcast that you are amenable to innovative business development in the digital economy, these are relatively low-cost, low-risk ways to send that signal. That's why we've seen leaders across the ideological spectrum and all over the country take tangible steps in this direction,\" he said.\n\nWhere the state-level crypto efforts can be described as \"bigger steps\" — Marlowe cited Texas, Arizona, and Florida, as examples — he said it has helped to acknowledge the growing political power of crypto advocates in these states.\n\nSimilarities in the actions taken across states to date include include authorizing the state treasurer or other investment official to allow the investment of a limited amount of public funds in crypto and building out the governance structure needed to invest in crypto. This often will involve more frequent reporting requirements and stronger custodial agreements compared to traditional asset classes. The seeding of the reserve can take the form of utilizing cash or government-seized crypto, as in the recent case of the federal government. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a strategic bitcoin reserve last March, but limited the authorization to seized crypto in an effort to show taxpayers would bear no financial burden.\n\nIt is no surprise that Texas was the first state to fund a crypto reserve. Texas has been a crypto hub for years through its role in bitcoin mining. The state's affordable and flexible power, as well as a political environment that has largely been pro-crypto, led Texas in recent years to a sizable position in not just the national, but global bitcoin hashing market.\n\n\"Texas has spent the last few years becoming one of the key centers of bitcoin activity, especially on the mining side,\" said Christian Catalini, founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab, seeing this move as one that early branded the state as \"open for business\" when it comes to digital assets.\n\n\"Once you've made that bet on infrastructure and industry, adding some Bitcoin exposure at the treasury level is a natural next step,\" Catalini said. Such a move essentially makes the state's balance sheet one that is explicitly aligned with the ecosystem it aims to attract.\n\nTexas also has a long history with bitcoin's traditional market competitor: gold.\n\n\"Texas has proven to be a bedrock of government adoption of bitcoin, starting with laws that allow for legal custody arrangements akin to gold storage laws that are well established there,\" said Nik Bhatia, founder of The Bitcoin Layer.\n\nWhen it comes to storing physical gold, Texas has clear rules on storage and ownership, and even the language invoked – vaults, custodians – helps grease the wheels for crypto assets at the state level. The Texas Bullion Depository of 2015, which allowed for state-level depository of bullion and precious metals, was specifically adapted to apply to digital assets like bitcoin. The Texas Bullion Depositary was the first state-administered precious metals depository in the nation.\n\nTexas has not purchased any on-chain bitcoin. After passing the legislation to create a strategic bitcoin reserve that gave authorization to the state comptroller to hold the cryptocurrency, Texas purchased a stake in a bitcoin ETF — roughly $5 million in the largest bitcoin ETF, the BlackRock iShares' Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which since its launch in January 2024 has grown to over $72 billion in assets under management.\n\nThe Comptroller's office made its purchase on the morning of November 20, 2025, when the price of a single bitcoin was $91,336. As of Saturday morning, bitcoin was trading at a little over $95,000.\n\nBhatia said the approval of bitcoin ETFs by the SEC was crucial to the state plans to be comfortable with the holdings under current U.S. securities law. \"Using ETFs is a very clean and safe way to invest in bitcoin, minimizing storage logistical risk and opting for security law protection,\" Bhatia said.\n\nTexas state officials have described this purchase — which deployed only half of the $10 million set aside by the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve — as a \"placeholder\" while security and storage for raw bitcoin can be put into place.\n\nIn addition to the concept of reserve funds, states are bringing crypto into core finance functions, with an approach that balances the inherent trepidation of venturing into new terrain with a desire to be a part of the fast-moving crypto realm.\n\nNew Hampshire, for example, became the first state to approve the issuance of a bitcoin-backed municipal bond last November, a $100 million issuance that would mark the first time cryptocurrency is used as collateral in the U.S. municipal bond market. The deal has not taken place yet, though plans are for the issuance to occur this year. \"The idea is they'll use bitcoin to back a municipal bond issue, the proceeds of which will then be divvied up into loans to smaller governments for economic development projects across the state,\" Marlowe said. Repayment of these loans will recapitalize the fund.\n\nIt is a creative evolution in state finances, but like many of the mechanisms for crypto development at the state level, it utilizes existing financial structures and state goals, according to Marlowe, with similar public bonds in prior decades used for projects like clean water, school upgrades, and other infrastructure. \"What's different here is it's bitcoin rather than taxpayer dollars as the collateral,\" he said.\n\nIn numerous states, including, Colorada, Utah, and Louisiana, crypto is now accepted as payment for taxes and other state business. As more state public finance crypto efforts develop, the shift represents a change in a core philosophy of safety and liquidity that has dominated the investing of state and local funds for centuries.\n\nIn recent decades, assets including real estate and private equity expanded the investment approach of public funds, but crypto represents not only the most recent addition, but the most volatile.\n\n\"For many in the state/local investing industry, crypto-backed assets are still far too speculative and volatile for public money,\" Marlowe said. \"But others, and I think there's a sort of generational shift in the works, see it as a reasonable store of value that is actually stronger on many other public sector values like transparency and asset integrity,\" he added.",

The rapper has posted her hilarious, expletive-filled celebrations to Diggs' touchdowns on social media amidst the news that the pair welcomed their first child together in November.\n\nAnd now, Cardi B has gone through yet another rite of passage for sports fans celebrating their team's big win: dunking on analysts that predicted incorrectly.\n\nOn Sunday, the Patriots bested the Houston Texans 28-16 in a game that was basically over at the half thanks to C.J. Stroud's four interceptions. The loss was quite a stunning one for Texans supporters and especially for analysts that predicted Houston to come out on top. ESPN's NFL Live crew, for example, all picked the Texans in an incredibly amusing segment on the show this week.\n\nAs expected, the picks backfired tremendously and the Patriots cruised to the AFC Championship. However for the final blow, right after the clock hit zero, Cardi B swooped in to dunk on the NFL Live crew's disastrously incorrect predictions for Sunday's game with a short — but sweet — video response.\n\nTHEY DIDN’T BELIEVE IN US !!!

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt's an unfortunate call to action for Stidham, but it also is the biggest game of his life. The upcoming AFC Championship game is the biggest game he's ever played as he's stepping in as the Denver Broncos' starting quarterback after Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury, marking his first-ever playoff start and a huge opportunity in a high-stakes game.\n\nThe 29-year old quarterback hails from a small town roughly 100 miles west of Dallas, Stephenville, TX. He was a standout in his high school days playing for Stephenville High. He emerged as one of the nation's most sought-after quarterback prospects, earning national attention, transferring south of Stephenville to Baylor in Waco, before later transferring to Auburn.\n\nWith Bo Nix out for the season, Denver’s starting QB for next Sunday’s AFC Championship Game will be Jarrett Stidham.

He led the Tigers to an SEC Championship appearance and earned Second-Team All-SEC honors, becoming the SEC Newcomer of the Year. It was his deep-ball accuracy and skillset that earned him an NFL Draft selection in 2019 by the New England Patriots.\n\nAfter three seasons with the Patriots, he was traded to the Raiders in 2022. He later signed a two-year deal with the Broncos in 2023 and then resigned in 2025. Stidham has spent much of his career as a dependable backup, occasionally stepping in when needed but never fully seizing a starting role.

    "description": "We moved from Texas to Denver and downsized our home, gaining more time together, walkability, community, and freedom for our kids.",
    "fullText": "In July 2025, my husband, Zach, and I moved our family of four from the suburbs of Ft Worth, Texas, to Denver.\n\nAfter nearly 10 years of marriage, two kids, and three work-related moves, it was finally time to settle in a place of our choosing. This time, we didn't just want a change of scenery; we wanted a change of lifestyle.\n\nBut finding a house in the bustling city neighborhood of our dreams within our budget meant downsizing — drastically.\n\nMoving from our 3,300-square-foot home to a 2,300-square-foot bungalow with 1,200 square feet of actual living space (the rest being unfinished basement) wasn't easy. It meant swapping our large kitchen island for a small dining table. It meant no more master bath soaking tub, my refuge from life's stresses on more occasions than I could count. And it meant my kids giving up their separate rooms to share one.\n\nBut what we've gained in the quality and quantity of time spent together is worth every bit of lost square footage.\n\nOur bigger house in Texas required more upkeep, and we were more than happy to give that up for extra free time on the weekends. Now, we spend our time visiting attractions such as the Denver Zoo and the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. We're fostering our kids' curiosity, exploring new places together. Our everyday life feels more special and meaningful because these shared experiences amplify our family connection.\n\nWe're also getting out in nature more. Aside from weekend hiking and skiing adventures, our days revolve around outdoor living. We walk everywhere we can, including restaurants, parks, and even Trader Joe's, which is beneficial because driving to Trader Joe's means parking at Trader Joe's, and nobody enjoys that. Our moods are lighter, and our stresses are reduced.\n\nThe first time we walked to a restaurant instead of driving, it felt like we were on vacation. Our lives had always been car-dependent, but that's no longer the case. The kids laughed and raced each other down the sidewalk. We marvelled at the mature trees and brightly colored flowers lining 7th Avenue Parkway. There was no timeline or rushing, just the joy of being present. When we made our way home after an alfresco dinner at Postino, I asked my son if he liked walking to dinner. He asked simply, \"Can we do this every day?\"\n\nZach and I frequently sit on our front porch while our boys play with neighborhood kids, a first for us. Having houses so close together makes it easier to meet people and form real connections. We know almost every household on our block, and we regularly visit with our closest neighbors. We even enjoyed our first block party in August, which fell on my eldest's birthday, and according to him, it was his \"Best birthday ever!\"\n\nOur boys run between yards while we chat with new friends. They are experiencing a childhood closer to the one we grew up with. They're building confidence and finding their place, and that's translating to more smiles and fewer tantrums. Zach and I are finding our village, and parenthood feels less solitary.\n\nOn a recent trip back to Texas for Thanksgiving, I texted our next-door neighbor to let her know we'd be out of town. Without even asking, she offered to take in our mail. It may be a small gesture, but that sense of community is priceless to us.\n\nDownsizing has also allowed our kids to play more independently in an outdoor space that feels safe and protected. We have an unobstructed line of sight to the backyard, and no matter where my husband and I are in the house, we can hear them if they need us. The result has been hours of creative play, building campsites and outdoor kitchens, playing soccer and baseball, and having water balloon fights or Nerf battles.\n\nMost evenings, my kids are in the backyard playing games and getting dirty. When the weather is nice, they run around with their friends down the street. I would never have felt comfortable not knowing every move my kids were making before, but here, where everyone is watching out, and I can wave at my kids down the block to signal when it's time to come home, less space means more freedom.\n\nOur downsized life isn't always perfect. Despite all our decluttering efforts, we're still left with more stuff than we can accommodate. We also struggle with the lack of privacy, and at times, our smaller shared space feels more claustrophobic than cozy. However, downsizing for an urban lifestyle has given us the opportunity to live beyond our four walls, and that's worth more than any amount of space could ever be.",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M's 2026 quarterback room will be a talking point heading into the early parts of the offseason, as head coach Mike Elko and new QB coach Joey Lynch have yet to land a veteran signal caller from the transfer portal after incoming redshirt junior QB Marcel Reed announced his return for the 2026 campaign, while 2025 backup Miles O'Neill transferred to North Carolina earlier this year.\n\nOn paper, Marcel Reed's backup will likely be incoming sophomore Brady Hart, who served as the No. 3 option last season and is well respected by the coaching staff, which has praised his maturity and accuracy despite being the youngest player on the roster. A former Michigan commit, Hart possesses enough arm talent and now a year of experience to be trusted in the No. 2 role.\n\nStill, it's highly unlikely Elko adds another veteran arm, and with 2025 four-star signee Helaman Casuga, Brady Hart will immediately compete with the freshman phenom, who has continued to show off his impressive accuracy and touch during Friday's Polynesian Bowl, as the Utah high school standout found 2027 five-star Ohio State commit for one of the better throws you'll see all weekend.\n\nCasuga is a much more fluid athlete than Brady Hart and fits the mold of what Elko and new offensive coordinator Holmon Wiggins are looking for in making plays out of the pocket. However, his lack of experience at the college level will hinder his ability to secure the backup job, but anything is possible.\n\nCasuga finished his career at Corner Canyon HS with 11,516 yards, 113 touchdowns, and 32 interceptions, combined with 1,083 rushing yards and 18 touchdowns.\n\nNice throw from Texas A&M QB signee @HelamanCasuga. https://t.co/erKpgmde5v\n\n— Carter Karels (@CarterKarels) January 17, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Watch QB Helaman Casuga's impressive throw during Polynesian Bowl",

    "fullText": "The Texas A&M basketball team enters rivalry weekend looking to reset after a grueling double‑overtime loss to Tennessee. It was a tough shooting night across the board, and the Aggies will aim to get back on track Saturday when they travel to Austin to face the Texas Longhorns.\n\nFor head coach Bucky McMillan, it marks his first experience in the Lone Star Showdown — and an opportunity to do something no A&M coach has accomplished since 2001: win in Austin. He understands exactly what this rivalry means to Aggies everywhere, but he’s also pushing his team to stay grounded and avoid getting swept up in the noise.\n\n\" ...our players got to block out all the noise and just know that our success going to in this game is going to be on their ability to focus on the things that equate to winning basketball\"\n\nIt’s not about minimizing the rivalry, McMillan emphasized, but recognizing the bigger picture. The SEC grind is long, and every conference game carries weight. That perspective has been reinforced by A&M’s 3–1 start in league play — a stretch that has boosted the team’s confidence despite the close calls.\n\n\"it's been great and that's why I say we can get caught up like a game slips away here or there where you're right there to win it. But there's also a lot of games on the flipside of that that we executed and won,\"\n\nA win on Saturday would move the Aggies to 4–1 in SEC play, a meaningful early‑season marker that could pay dividends later in the year. For McMillan, the message remains simple: play their style, trust their habits, and let the chips fall where they may.\n\nBelow, you can watch the full press conference with Coach Bucky.\n\nTexas A&M will face the Texas Longhorns in Austin at the Moody Center on Saturday, January 17, at 5 p.m. CT.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A Cuban immigrant died in a Texas immigration detention facility earlier this month during an altercation with guards, and the local medical examiner has indicated that his death will likely be classified as a homicide.\n\nThe federal government has provided a differing account surrounding the Jan. 3 death of Geraldo Lunas Campos, saying the detainee was attempting suicide and staff tried to save him.\n\nA witness told The Associated Press that Lunas Campos died after he was handcuffed, tackled by guards and placed in a chokehold until he lost consciousness. The immigrant’s family was told by the El Paso County Medical Examiner’s Office on Wednesday that a preliminary autopsy report said the death was a homicide resulting from asphyxia from chest and neck compression, according to a recording of the call reviewed by the AP.\n\nThe death and conflicting accounts have intensified scrutiny into the conditions of immigration jails at a time when the government has been rounding up immigrants in large numbers around the country and detaining them at facilities like the one in El Paso where Lunas Campos died.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is legally required to issue public notification of detainee deaths. Last week, it said Lunas Campos, a 55-year-old father of four and registered sex offender, had died at Camp East Montana, but made no mention of him being involved in an altercation with staff immediately before his death.\n\nIn response to questions from the AP, the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, on Thursday amended its account of Lunas Campos’ death, saying he tried to kill himself.\n\n“Campos violently resisted the security staff and continued to attempt to take his life,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said. “During the ensuing struggle, Campos stopped breathing and lost consciousness.”\n\nIn an interview before DHS updated its account, detainee Santos Jesús Flores, 47, from El Salvador, said he witnessed the incident through the window of his cell in the special housing unit, where detainees are held in isolation for disciplinary infractions.\n\n“He didn’t want to enter the cell where they were going to put him,” Flores told the AP on Thursday, speaking in Spanish from a phone in the facility. “The last thing he said was that he couldn’t breathe.”\n\nAmong the first sent to Camp Montana East\n\nCamp Montana East is a sprawling tent facility hastily constructed in the desert on the grounds of Fort Bliss, an Army base. The AP reported in August that the $1.2 billion facility, expected to become the largest detention facility in the United States, was being built and operated by a private contractor headquartered in a single-family home in Richmond, Virginia. The company, Acquisition Logistics LLC, had no prior experience running a corrections facility.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the guards present when Lunas Campos died were government employees or those of the private contractor. Emails seeking comment on Thursday from Acquisition Logistics executives received no response.\n\nLunas Campos was among the first detainees sent to Camp Montana East, arriving in September after ICE arrested him in Rochester, New York, where he lived for more than two decades. He was legally admitted to the U.S. in 1996, part of a wave of Cuban immigrants seeking to reach Florida by boat.\n\nICE said he was picked up in July as part of a planned immigration enforcement operation due to criminal convictions that made him eligible for removal.\n\nNew York court records show Lunas Campos was convicted in 2003 of sexual contact with an individual under 11, a felony for which he was sentenced to one year in jail and placed on the state’s sex offender registry.\n\nLunas Campos was also sentenced to five years in prison and three years of supervision in 2009 after being convicted of attempting to sell a controlled substance, according to the New York corrections records. He completed the sentence in January 2017.\n\nLunas Campos’ adult daughter said the child sexual abuse accusation was false, made as part of a contentious custody battle.\n\n“My father was not a child molester,” said Kary Lunas, 25. “He was a good dad. He was a human being.”\n\nOn the day he died, according to ICE, Lunas Campos became disruptive while in line for medication and refused to return to his assigned dorm. He was then taken to the segregation block.\n\n“While in segregation, staff observed him in distress and contacted on-site medical personnel for assistance,” the agency said in its Jan. 9 release. “Medical staff responded, initiated lifesaving measures, and requested emergency medical services.”\n\nLunas Campos was pronounced dead after paramedics arrived.\n\nFlores said that account omitted key details — Lunas Campos was already handcuffed when at least five guards pinned him to the floor, and at least one squeezed his arm around the detainee's neck.\n\nWithin about five minutes, Flores said, Lunas Campos was no longer moving.\n\n“After he stopped breathing, they removed the handcuffs,” Flores said.\n\nFlores is not represented by a lawyer and said he has already consented to deportation to his home country. Though he acknowledged he was taking a risk by speaking to the AP, Flores said he wanted to highlight that “in this place, guards abuse people a lot.”\n\nHe said multiple detainees in the unit witnessed the altercation, and security cameras there should have captured the events. Flores also said investigators had not interviewed him.\n\nDHS did not respond to questions about whether Lunas Campos was handcuffed when they say he attempted suicide, or exactly how he had tried to kill himself.\n\n“ICE takes seriously the health and safety of all those detained in our custody,” McLaughlin said. “This is still an active investigation, and more details are forthcoming.”\n\nDHS wouldn’t say whether other agencies were investigating. The El Paso medical examiner’s office confirmed Thursday that it conducted an autopsy, but declined further comment.\n\nA final determination of homicide by the medical examiner would typically be critical in determining whether any guards are held criminally or civilly liable. When such deaths are ruled accidental or something other than homicide, they are less likely to trigger criminal investigations, while civil wrongful death lawsuits become harder to prove.\n\nThe fact that Lunas Campos died on an Army base could also limit state and local officials’ legal jurisdiction to investigate. An El Paso County District Attorney’s Office spokesperson declined to comment Thursday on whether it was involved in an investigation.\n\nThe deaths of inmates and other detainees after officers hold them face down and put pressure on their backs and necks to restrain them have been a problem in law enforcement for decades. A 2024 AP investigation documented hundreds of deaths during police encounters in which people were restrained in a prone position. Many uttered “I can’t breathe” before suffocating, according to scores of body camera and bystander videos. Authorities often attempt to shift the blame for such deaths to preexisting medical conditions or drug use.\n\nDr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist who has studied prone restraint deaths, said the preliminary autopsy ruling of homicide indicates guards' actions caused Lunas Campos’ death, but does not mean they intended to kill. He said the medical examiner’s office could come under pressure to stop short of calling it a homicide, but will probably “stick to its guns.”\n\n“This probably passes the ‘but for’ test. ‘But for’ the actions of the officers, he would not have died. For us, that’s generally a homicide,” he said.\n\n‘I just want justice, and his body here’\n\nJeanette Pagan-Lopez, the mother of Lunas Campos’ two youngest children, said the day after he died the medical examiner’s office called to inform her that his body was at the county morgue. She immediately called ICE to find out what happened.\n\nPagan-Lopez, who lives in Rochester, said the assistant director of the El Paso ICE field office eventually called her back. She said the official told her the cause of death was still pending and that they were awaiting toxicology report results. He also told her the only way Lunas Campos’ body could be returned to Rochester free of charge was if she consented to his being cremated, she said.\n\nPagan-Lopez declined and is now seeking help from family and friends to raise the money needed to ship his body home and pay for a funeral.\n\nAfter failing to get details about the circumstances surrounding his death from ICE, Pagan-Lopez said she got a call from a detainee at Camp Montana East who then put her in touch with Flores, who first told her about the altercation with guards.\n\nSince then, she said she has repeatedly called ICE, but is no longer getting a response. Pagan-Lopez, who is a U.S. citizen, said she also twice called the FBI, where an agent took her information and then hung up.\n\nPagan-Lopez said she and Lunas Campos were together about 15 years before breaking up eight years ago. She described him as an attentive father who, until his detention, had worked in a minimum-wage job at a furniture store, the only employment she said he could find due to his criminal record.\n\nShe said that in the family's last phone call the week after Christmas, Lunas Campos talked to his kids about his expected deportation back to Cuba. He said he wanted them to visit the island, so that he could stay in their lives.\n\n“He wasn’t a bad guy,” Pagan-Lopez said. “I just want justice, and his body here. That’s all I want.”\n\nAttanasio reported from Seattle, and Foley from Iowa City.\n\nContact the AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org or https://www.ap.org/tips/.",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M's transfer portal haul now includes 18 commits, led by Alabama transfer wide receiver Isaiah Horton. After missing out on Auburn transfer wideout Cam Coleman, who committed to Texas, the Aggies possess one of the most complete wide receiver rotations in the country. While starting quarterback Marcel Reed is well-equipped next season, any success will start in the trenches.\n\nWith the NFL Draft declaration deadline up, five 2025 offensive linemen are off to the next level, including junior left guard Chase Bisontis, who would have likely returned if it weren't for his first or second round draft grade. Needing at least four replacements, head coach Mike Elko and O-line coach Adam Cushing immediately went to work, adding LSU tackle Tyree Adams and LSU guard Coen Echols, who was once an A&M commit.\n\nFurther shoring up the depth chart, Alabama guard/tackle Wilkin Formby, along with veteran South Carolina guard Trovon Baugh, committed to the Aggies, as all four players will compete for starting spots heading into the spring practice period.\n\nTexas A&M's defensive line rotation was also thin entering the new year, but the new additions of Northwestern edge Anto Saka, San Diego State edge Ryan Henderson, and defensive linemen CJ Mims (North Carolina), Angelo McCullom (Illinois), and Colorado transfer Brandon Davis-Swain make this group look formidable on paper at the very least.\n\nHowever, Texas A&M's 2026 secondary has a chance to be one of the top cornerback/safety rotations in the SEC, as senior corners Dezz Ricks and Julio Humphrey will return, and combined with transfer corner Rickey Gibson, this group is primed to be in lockdown mode on nearly every passing play. At safety, Colorado transfer Tawfiq Byard is extremely versatile and one of the top coverage safeties, having not allowed a passing touchdown in over 500 coverage snaps.\n\nWhile the Aggies could still add a running back, many, including myself, believe this group is all but complete, and, according to On3's transfer portal rankings, is the fourth-ranked transfer cycle, and No. 1 among SEC programs, positioned below Virginia Tech (3), Texas Tech (2), and Indiana (1).\n\nIn today's college football landscape, \"adapt or die\" is the prevailing mentality: either sink or stay above water. If adding double-digit transfers isn't the first priority at the end of every season, relying on younger players usually results in an average-to-below-average season.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M's 2026 transfer portal class ranked Top 5 nationally",

    "description": "One sheriff who leads an anti-smuggling task force says the software helps “develop leads to eventually obtain probable cause.” Civil liberties experts say its use violates constitutional rights.",
    "fullText": "Editor’s Note: This story is the third installment in a series produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center’s AI Accountability Network.\n\nGoliad County police kicked off one human smuggling investigation not with a suspect’s name, but with a discarded receipt and cell phone surveillance software. In June 2021, Chief Deputy Tim Futch chased a speeding F-150 headed toward Houston on U.S. Highway 59; he believed the vehicle was carrying undocumented immigrants, concealed in the truck bed beneath plywood, according to a police report. Trying to evade the cops, the driver pulled into a ditch, and around 10 people bailed out and took off sprinting.\n\nIn the aftermath, Roy Boyd, the sheriff in this county of 7,000 situated halfway between Laredo and Houston, surveyed the scene. The driver proved hard to identify via the pickup’s plate. But, on the ground, he spotted a fresh receipt from a liquor store in Pasadena, a Houston suburb, he recalled in a June 2024 interview with the Texas Observer.\n\nThe stub of paper was enough, Boyd said, to justify deploying an expensive—and controversial—artificial intelligence-powered surveillance tool called Tangles. A specially-trained analyst used the receipt, Boyd said, to conduct warrantless surveillance on the suspected driver—and on other smart phone users—by utilizing a Tangles add-on feature called Webloc, which tracks mobile devices’ movements in a client-selected virtual area through a capability called “geofencing.”\n\nAfter the bailout incident, Boyd acquired a license for the tool with about $300,000 in state border security grants—though the sheriff admits that he’s not a tech guy: In 2024, he still used a hand-me-down iPhone 10, which hit the market in 2017.\n\nA tall, slim, seventh-generation Texan, Boyd fits the archetype of a small-town Southern sheriff with his firm handshake and light drawl. He usually wears his sand-colored cowboy hat, leather belt, and a matching holster manufactured by prisoners in a neighboring county. The latter encases a silver Colt pistol engraved with “Remember Goliad,” referencing the Mexican army’s massacre of Anglo combatants who lost a battle in which Boyd says his ancestors died.\n\nBoyd worked as a career cop in the neighboring South Texas city of Victoria before being elected sheriff of Goliad County in 2020. He’s since hobnobbed with President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago and met repeatedly with border czar Tom Homan, and he leads a multijurisdictional task force named after Operation Lone Star, Governor Greg Abbott’s multi-billion dollar border militarization mission. The task force pools deputies and resources from nearly 60 Texas agencies mainly for anti-smuggling operations. It began with mostly rural departments, but it expanded to include more populous counties, the Texas National Guard, the U.S. Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the Coast Guard. Task force members have spent at least $300,000 on Tangles, and according to emails obtained from Goliad County, many have been granted access to the software, which can track mobile device movements via third-party commercial data.\n\nTangles scrapes information from the open, deep, and dark webs and is the premier product of Cobwebs Technologies, a cybersecurity company founded in 2014 by three former members of special units in the Israeli military. In 2023, the Nebraska-based tech firm PenLink Ltd acquired the company.\n\nThe software has been met with criticism from civil liberties advocates, especially given that its WebLoc add-on enables warrantless device tracking. Normally, when U.S. police officers seek cell phone records or location data, they must obtain a warrant by presenting probable cause of a crime to a judge. In 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Carpenter v. United States that warrants are required for obtaining location data from cell phone providers. But the rise of the multi-billion dollar data broker industry has created a free-for-all that enables police and others to purchase massive amounts of cell phone location data without judicial review.\n\nNathan Wessler, an ACLU attorney who argued the Carpenter case, said data broker-built services like Tangles pose the same privacy issues as those decided in the Supreme Court case and that law enforcement’s ability to buy location data constitutes an erosion of constitutionally protected rights. “Police are doing an end run around this well-articulated system of judicial oversight by just paying money instead of going to a judge,” he said. “There’s just no checks of police abuse against that.”\n\nIn the Goliad County case, a police analyst drew a virtual fence to examine an area that spanned about 300 miles between the Pasadena liquor store and the U.S.-Mexico border based on the day and time stamped on the receipt. He discovered that six phones used within a mile of the store had been tracked again later at a Texas immigration checkpoint, Boyd said. He didn’t specify which checkpoint; the U.S. Border Patrol has over a dozen of them in Texas, some permanent and some temporary.\n\nBoyd rattles off statistics about the success of his task force in tracking gangs, but he provided only the one example involving Tangles and never said whether the information they obtained by geofencing helped lead to any arrest. In response to records requests, the department said it had no reports that mentioned Tangles, despite the fact that Goliad has had the software for more than three years. The corresponding incident report for the case Boyd cited doesn’t mention Tangles, though he said an analyst used the software. It does state that the department collaborated with a Homeland Security Investigations analyst.\n\nGenerally, Boyd said his office uses the software to find “avenues for obtaining probable cause” or “to verify reasonable suspicion that you already have”—not as a basis by itself to make arrests.\n\nBeyond Goliad, Tangles has more powerful, deep-pocketed users. The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), for example, has invested heavily in the software. DPS spent nearly $200,000 on Tangles in 2021 as an emergency purchase related to Operation Lone Star, and the agency has repeatedly expanded its contract. In 2024, DPS inked a 5-year, $5.3-million contract for 230 named users. ICE’s Office of Intelligence signed a contract worth around $2 million to use the software in 2025, and the DEA in that same timeframe committed more than $10 million.\n\nBoyd and Caleb Breshears, a Goliad County deputy and the task force commander, argued in interviews that Tangles presents no privacy concerns since its location tracking software doesn’t reveal names, only device identification numbers in the online advertising ecosystem. Tangles users cannot search by name or by phone number; its location data is sourced from applications in which consumers consented to sharing their whereabouts, Breshears said.\n\nNor does Tangles reveal what vehicle is associated with a device, but combined with Texas’ broader arsenal of surveillance tools, which includes a fleet of drones and a network of automated license plate readers, “Those are things that we might be able to piece together,” Boyd said.\n\nPenLink Ltd, Tangles’ present owner, touts its worldwide successes in combating human trafficking, drug smuggling, and money laundering, but the company declined to provide specific examples to the Observer of how the platform has assisted in U.S. cases. “Penlink is proud to provide law enforcement with solutions that keep communities safe, protect people, rescue victims and solve crimes,” company spokesperson Kristine German said in a written statement. “Our technology enables law enforcement to spot threats faster and use evidence more efficiently to advance criminal investigations. The solutions we provide to the government exclusively use commercially available data. We follow industry best practices and comply with all relevant privacy laws, platform policies, and ethical standards.”\n\nIn El Salvador, where authoritarian president Nayib Bukele has suspended civil liberties, the national police force purchased Tangles in 2020, according to the investigative outlet El Faro. Just 13 months later, the state’s Bukele-controlled legislative assembly approved criminal code reforms that allowed the judicial use of information obtained via warrantless surveillance by tools like Tangles, clearing the way for the dictator’s state police to legally spy on citizens, El Faro reported. When asked about a repressive regime using its products, PenLink said the company does “not discuss specific customers or contracts.”\n\nPenLink pitches Tangles as an “open source intelligence” software that compiles publicly available information. Yet even Meta, the social media giant that owns Facebook and Instagram and has been denounced for stockpiling too much of its own users data, has accused Cobwebs Technologies, the company that invented Tangles, of operating as a “surveillance-for-hire” outfit; Meta banned Cobwebs Technologies from its platforms in 2021.\n\nIn a separate emailed statement, PenLink distanced itself from the Meta ban: “Penlink acquired Cobwebs in 2023, after those issues had been addressed and we are not aware of any issues since.”\n\nBut critics find U.S. law enforcement’s growing domestic use of an array of surveillance tools presents major risks to civil liberties by enabling police to build a robust profile of almost anyone’s life and movements without a warrant or probable cause. They find phone-tracking tools like Tangles to be particularly troubling.\n\n“There’s this veneer of respect for privacy that is painted over all of this data aggregation and consolidation,” said Beryl Lipton, a researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a California-based nonprofit focused on digital privacy-related civil liberties. Watchdog organizations like the EFF and ACLU have been forced to go to court to discover more information about its use: Last January, PenLink sued a California sheriff’s office in an attempt to prevent the department from releasing public records to EFF that contained details about the company’s products and prices, arguing they were “trade secret-protected information.” EFF intervened in the case and ultimately prevailed. The sheriff’s office handed over the records.\n\nSo far, federal and Texas agencies combined have committed to spending at least $8 million dollars specifically for Tangles, according to a year-long Observer investigation. Yet, agencies refuse to say how Tangles has benefitted Texas criminal or immigration probes. Boyd said he couldn’t think of a time that phone-tracking data has been directly linked to any arrest or prosecution in Goliad County, despite his agency’s task force role. “Most of that is probably going to be on the federal side and not so much on the state side,” Boyd said. “I can’t think of any time when [Tangles] has been used for the prosecution of somebody. … It has not been a key component in our cases.”\n\nDPS declined comment on its use of the costly technology. In response to a records request, the agency told the Observer it has no incident reports and only seven confidential internal investigative reports from 2023 and 2024 that mention “Cobwebs” (a shorthand sometimes used to refer to the the software named after the company that created it) or “Tangles,” but it withheld them claiming that releasing the documents could “provide wrong-doers, drug traffickers, terrorists, and other criminals with information concerning how Department operations are planned, implemented and staffed.”\n\nIn the last three years, many DPS investigators, police departments including those of major cities such as Dallas and Houston, and nearly 20 Texas sheriff’s offices have obtained a Tangles log-in. The larger agencies have been evasive about how and when they use the tool, declining to provide examples to the Observer.\n\nNo agencies contacted for this story provided examples of Tangles’ use in any specific criminal cases. Dallas Police Department spokesperson Corbin Rubinson said only that “Tangles has been in use by the Department for several years and is used consistently in criminal investigations. The WebLoc add-on is used less frequently and produces fewer investigative leads.” A Houston police spokesman said Tangles is used for “crime analysis, for supporting criminal Investigations, and for supporting situational awareness/threat assessments” and that the department does not use the WebLoc add-on that enables warrantless device tracking. Other agencies that purchased it, including the Killeen Police Department and the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office, did not respond.\n\nTexas agencies’ failure to produce reports on arrests or other results linked to the controversial technology has two possible interpretations, experts say. “Either this is just a massive waste of taxpayer money, right? They’re spending all this money on the tool that they’re not actually using,” said Wessler, the ACLU attorney, “or they’re using it and hiding it from judges, criminal defense attorneys, criminal defendants and the press, which is a big story in itself.”\n\nIn April, state Senator Sarah Eckhardt, an Austin Democrat, raised questions during a border security committee hearing about DPS’ investment of $20 million in multi-year contracts for various AI-powered social media monitoring tools like Tangles, following an earlier Observer report on the state police agency’s spending on surveillance tech.\n\nIn response, DPS Director Freeman Martin told Eckhardt and other committee members that such software has been critical in preventing mass shootings and said DPS had identified a potential school shooter using the technology.\n\nBut when the Observer approached Martin a few days later at a border sheriffs’ conference, he added only a few general observations, saying that the software has helped police save lives and make arrests.\n\n“If I talk about technology now, and we’re asking for funding, some people like it, some people hate it,” he said, clarifying that Tangles in particular was controversial after the Observer asked about the software. “We don’t want to lose those tools,” he said. “We want all the tools. When somebody’s threatening to shoot up the school, we got to find them. We can’t wait till school starts.”\n\nMartin initially promised to speak more about the agency’s successes with Tangles after the legislative session, which ended in June. But he never responded to requests for a follow-up interview made through his secretary and the agency’s communications office, nor did he answer a list of questions sent by the Observer.\n\nWessler, the ACLU attorney, is skeptical that Tangles has been used to prevent mass casualty events. He said in emergencies police can obtain warrants and send rapid requests to cell phone service providers, who generally can supply more up-to-date and accurate location data than third-party tools. “The claim that this has helped prevent mass shootings is really interesting, and sounds pretty far-fetched to me.”\n\nBreshears, the Goliad County task force leader, explained that the software’s underlying location data are typically days old. That means it does not allow for real-time tracking and is only useful when multiple factors align. “When you say ‘track’, technically it’s correct, but … I’m not tracking you live. I can only see where you have been,” Breshears said. “It’s all historical information.”\n\nTexas law does not explicitly require police to document use of AI-powered surveillance tech, so police reports may not be a reliable indicator of whether Tangles has been used even in investigations that led to arrests. In the 2025 legislative session, Southlake Republican Giovanni Capriglione introduced a bill that would have mandated government agencies using AI to disclose use of these systems to “consumers.” It is unclear how that might have applied to police reports, which under the public information act already can be heavily redacted under certain circumstances, especially if an investigation is ongoing. Legislators ultimately passed an overhauled version of the bill that does not explicitly require police to document or disclose use of AI.\n\nUnder due process rules and Texas’ Michael Morton Act, prosecutors must share relevant investigative reports, videos, and other related information to anyone charged with a crime. But the Observer reached out to all 80 federal public defender offices, emailed Texas defense attorneys and Dallas’ district attorney, and interviewed a longtime Houston public defender and a former Goliad-area prosecutor, yet no one provided information about Tangles being mentioned in records disclosed to them while representing a client or charging a defendant in criminal court.\n\nAmrutha Jindal, executive director of Lone Star Defenders, which provides public defenders for migrants prosecuted under Operation Lone Star, said she had never come across any evidence the software had been used in any of the nonprofit’s cases. “Alarms are ringing in my head,” Jindal said in a phone interview. “There’s also a question of—are we even being told?”\n\nThe Observer found many examples in police records of how Texas state troopers have surveilled the homes of immigrants or made pre-textual traffic stops to help ICE target and detain people who were not charged with a crime. However, it is unclear whether state police used Tangles or other surveillance tools. The Observer reached out to a network of more than 60 immigration attorneys in Texas and beyond, and none offered examples of how this software may have been used against their clients.\n\nIn Washington D.C., the district’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency (HSEMA) has purchased Tangles for several years, though it has not said how it deploys the tool; in August, the ACLU of DC filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking records.\n\nOne of the executives at PenLink, the parent company that sells Tangles, is Derek Maltz, a former DEA agent who participated in Border 911, a political nonprofit, with others who are now homeland security leaders in the Trump administration. He served as PenLink’s executive director of government relations from 2014 to 2025. Throughout that time, the DEA doled out more than $100 million in contracts with PenLink for its various products, according to public federal spending data. Maltz left the company to serve as the DEA’s acting director for five months after Trump’s second inauguration. Last summer, Maltz pivoted back to PenLink, where he became senior vice president of global business growth and strategy. Since Maltz re-joined PenLink last July, the company has garnered about $3.4 million \n\nIn a written statement, a PenLink spokesperson said: “Derek Maltz is a veteran national security and law enforcement leader who brings 28 years of federal law enforcement experience to his role at Penlink. His appointment as Acting Administrator speaks to his expertise in this field, and we are pleased to welcome him back to Penlink. We are compliant with Federal Post-Employment Restrictions.” Maltz did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nParomita Shah, an attorney and co-founder of Just Futures Law, a legal advocacy group focused on the intersection of immigration and surveillance issues, said Maltz’s case illustrates a well-established revolving door between tech companies and the federal government. “As much as these guys complain about the swamp, they certainly benefit from it,” Shah said.\n\nLocal agencies from New York to California have also bought Tangles. In Arizona, the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office—a populous county about halfway between Phoenix and Tucson—paid more than $90,000 in 2022 and 2023 to use the platform. In an email, Pinal County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Sam Salzwedel noted that deputies have deployed Tangles for a “variety of investigations, large and small,” but declined to share any success stories, citing law enforcement sensitivity. Salzwedel said that WebLoc, the warrantless phone tracking feature, appeared to be used sparingly.\n\n“I have not surveyed our handful of users, but one of our analysts just told me he has only used it a few times,” Salzwedel wrote in an email. “No warrant was obtained.”\n\nA reimbursement request released by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the privacy-focused nonprofit, and first reported by the Arizona Mirror, offers a few anecdotes about how Tucson police have used Tangles: To surveil protesters during one of former Vice President Kamala Harris’s visits to the state and to track and identify a suspect accused in a string of Circle K cigarette robberies. Tucson police also apparently used Tangles in an attempt to find the culprit behind an attempted abduction of a young woman, but without success.\n\nEven police who possess Tangles, like Boyd, warn of its potential for abuse. He says his department seldom deploys it for fear of violating constitutional privacy rights—and that despite leading a police task force, the sheriff is skeptical of cops collecting too much sensitive information.\n\n“Do you really want all your stuff in a database where any law enforcement official can go in and just find out what you’ve got going on, or where you’ve been going on any given day?” he said. “I just don’t think that the government needs a catch-all where they can obtain whatever information they want on you at a moment’s notice.”",

    "fullText": "Two Brownsville police officers helped a homeless man during a cold morning patrol\n\nBody camera footage of the encounter spread widely on social media\n\nOfficer Gonzalo Rubio says the moment reflects everyday acts of service that often go unseen\n\nA routine patrol through downtown Brownsville turned into a viral moment after two police officers stopped to help a homeless man on a cold morning. The interaction, later shared widely online, struck a chord far beyond the Texas city.\n\nAccording to the Brownsville Police Department, Officers Gonzalo Rubio and Francisco Maldonado encountered the man early in the morning while driving through the downtown area. The department said the officers noticed the chilly weather and realized the man needed warm, dry clothing.\n\n“Noticing the chilly weather and seeing that the man needed warm, dry clothing, the officers stepped in to help,” the department explained in a Facebook post,\n\nOfficer Rubio, who grew up in Brownsville, later reflected on the moment as part of everyday policing. “They’re not bothering anybody, they’re not doing anything wrong, and we just happen to be driving by,” he said of people often seen resting in the area.\n\nThe cold morning raised immediate concern when the officers saw the man trembling despite having a blanket. Rubio explained that when they tried to help, they realized the man wasn't wearing any pants, making the situation more urgent.\n\nAccording to Rubio, his partner immediately suggested buying clothing to keep the man warm. The officers worried the man might leave, so they asked dispatch to keep an eye on him while they went to purchase sweatpants.\n\nWhen the officers returned, the man was still there. It’s the moment they reunited with him and helped him get dressed that was captured on video by a nearby passerby.\n\nThe Brownsville Police Department later shared the body-worn camera footage on Facebook, calling it a moment of “service and humanity.” “In an act of compassion, Officers Rubio and Maldonado purchased new sweatpants for the man to ensure he stayed warm and comfortable,” the department wrote.\n\nAs the video spread, Rubio expressed surprise at the attention it received. “Sometimes it just goes away, like okay, whatever, that’s nice, but this one kept happening,” he said.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nRubio added that the viral clip showed only a small part of the job. “It was a rainy day, we still had 12 hours to go, so much other stuff happened that day that nobody knows about,” he said.\n\nFor the department, the moment reflected its broader mission. “The Brownsville Police Department is proud of our compassionate officers who continue to embody our commitment to serving our community with dignity, empathy, and respect,” the Facebook post concluded.",

    "description": "Despite losing to Tennessee on the road, Texas A&M is currently one of ESPN's Last Four Byes in Joe Lunardi's updated NCAA Tournament bracket.",
    "fullText": "Texas A&M (13-4, 3-1 SEC) lost its first SEC game of the year on the road vs. No. 24 Tennessee, falling to the Vols in double overtime 87-82 in a game where the Aggies led until the final five minutes. Due to Tennessee's size advantage, which has been the case throughout SEC play, Texas A&M was outrebounded 60-35, including 24 offensive rebounds that led to more than 20 points.\n\nFirst-year head coach Bucky McMillan has had to resort to small ball after losing transfer forward Mackenzie Mgbako for the year, whose size and shooting ability would have likely resulted in a win on Tuesday, while starting forward Rashaun Agee, who is listed at 6'7\", but likely shorter, leads the Aggies in rebounding with 8.6 per game.\n\nStill, this is the hand McMillan has been dealt, and his team continues to play with a ton of heart and physicality, and should be 16-1 if it weren't for late-game issues against UCF, SMU, and the final seconds against Tennessee.\n\nHowever, the Aggies should have gotten the ball back with just under ten seconds remaining in regulation after senior guard Rylan Griffin's near rebound was hit out of bounds by a Tennessee player, but the refs apparently did not see enough evidence to overturn the call. Either way, missed free throws, finishing 21-32 from the stripe, ultimately cost the Aggies in the end.\n\nTexas A&M is ahead of schedule in Year 1 of McMillan's tenure in College Station, and while Tuesday's loss was frustrating for the fan base, ESPN bracketology expert Joe Lunardi was seemingly impressed with the Aggies' performance in one of the toughest environments the SEC has to offer, placing McMillan's veteran squad as one of the Last Four Byes alonside Kentucky, USC, and Wisconsin.\n\nStill, Texas A&M needs to pick up more Quad 1 wins to have any shot of making the NCAA Tournament, with another opportunity on Saturday night against rival Texas in Austin.\n\n— Joe Lunardi (@ESPNLunardi) January 14, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M rises in ESPN's Bracketology despite losing to Tennessee",

    "fullText": "The ultimate goal for every football player who laces up their cleats is to reach the NFL. That dream narrows quickly after high school, and even for those talented enough to play at the collegiate level, the odds of landing on a professional roster remain slim. But unlike several other sports, football requires a massive number of bodies to function, and scouts flock to end‑of‑season showcases for one reason: finding a diamond in the rough.\n\nTexas A&M has several players projected to come off the board within the first two days of the 2026 NFL Draft. For those athletes, skipping an All‑Star event might be the smart play. For others, these games represent a final opportunity to get in front of evaluators who could ultimately pound the table for them in draft rooms this spring.\n\nTaurean York has been a constant in Aggieland, staying through the coaching transition and emerging as the heartbeat of the defense. His football IQ, leadership, and command of the unit will be difficult to replace, but he played a major role in preparing the next wave of linebackers to take the reins. While he doesn’t boast prototypical size or elite speed, he consistently puts himself in a position to make plays and elevate those around him.\n\nAfter a historic junior season, York has officially declared for the 2026 NFL Draft and accepted an invitation to the East‑West Shrine Bowl. It’s a chance to showcase his instincts, intelligence, and competitiveness in front of NFL scouts one more time as he looks to solidify his place at the next level.\n\nInvitation Accepted@AggieFootball LB Taurean York (@TaureanYork5x) is locked in for the East-West Shrine Bowl! 👍#GigEm | #ShrineBowlWHOSNEXT 😎 pic.twitter.com/bOPLsOGjYv\n\n— East-West Shrine Bowl (@ShrineBowl) January 12, 2026\n\nThe 2026 East-West Shrine Bowl kicks off January 27 at Ford Center at The Star in Frisco, Texas\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes, and opinions.

    "description": "Rick Havacko decided to move to a new state after working remotely during the pandemic in California. He narrowed his choices to Austin or Nashville.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rick Havacko, a 58-year-old corporate communications lead in Austin. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWorking remotely during the pandemic was the springboard for my move from California to Texas. I was born and raised in Orange County. I realized that although I love Laguna Niguel, I didn't want to live the rest of my life there.\n\nIt's beautiful, but once you get outside the city, it's congested, and prices are high.\n\nI've worked for Toshiba Business for 13 years, and I've always been fully remote. After my employer approved my move, the choice was between Austin (where I had visited before and enjoyed) and Nashville, which I had heard great things about.\n\nAfter traveling to both places in the summer of 2021, I decided to make Austin my home.\n\nBoth areas featured all the benefits of city life with a rural feel. Nashville is an amazing city and very similar to Austin. It has great music, culture, and a very creative vibe with tons of energy.\n\nWhat drew me to Austin is that it has my gym, LA Fitness, so I felt like I could really hit the ground running.\n\nI've been here for about four and a half years, and it's been one of the best things I've ever done.\n\nGrowing up in Orange County, the furthest I ever went was to San Diego for college, which is so close I could come home anytime I wanted. Austin was my first permanent move, so I had a little trepidation.\n\nI remember driving all night past Camp Pendleton, finally arriving in Tucson, Arizona, to spend the night. I got there about 1 a.m., and I felt a lot of uncertainty, like, Am I really going to like this place?\n\nWhen I hit the Hill Country, just before Fredericksburg, and headed into Austin, I passed the beautiful sawgrass and oak trees, and a sense of calm enveloped me, giving me the feeling that I was in a good place.\n\nI moved to Dripping Springs, which is 20 miles west of downtown Austin. It's more affordable than Southern California and less congested, but ultimately, it came down to the energy of the city and its people.\n\nI look outside my window, and often see deer, foxes, wild turkey, and even a Longhorn steer walking by my fence. I would never experience that in Laguna Niguel. I love nature.\n\nI no longer have immediate family in California, but I miss my friends back home. Making new friends has been the biggest challenge I've faced, but I keep trying. I've joined a volleyball league and play soccer and softball, where I meet people.\n\nI miss the world-class beaches in California; here we're pretty landlocked. I'm also a huge Angels fan. I grew up following the team, and Toshiba has a suite at Angel Stadium, so I used to attend many games. I also enjoyed attending LA Galaxy games. For now, I've adopted the University of Texas Longhorns for football and baseball, and I go to those games.\n\nWhile Texans are not required to file a state income tax return (only a federal one), property taxes appear to be significantly higher here. Properties themselves, however, are relatively inexpensive here. My property here is about twice the size of my home in California, and it was less expensive.\n\nOverall, it's still cheaper to live here, although Austin is one of the priciest cities in Texas. Gas is more affordable in Austin, but other living costs are comparable. I kept my same salary when I moved.\n\nHere in Dripping Springs, you see people with big belt buckles and cowboy boots. It's cool and culturally different from Orange County.\n\nDowntown Austin is one of the most vibrant and exciting places on the planet. It bustles with positive energy, with live music at pretty much every turn, and the University of Texas at Austin adds to that vibe.\n\nI'm very happy here and plan to stay permanently.",

He arrives in El Paso after spending the past five years as president of Monterey Bay FC, another club competing in the USL Championship.\n\nGonzalez brings 25 years of coaching experience, with stops across Major League Soccer, the USL Championship and MLS NEXT Pro. Most recently, he served as head coach of LAFC II.\n\nGonzalez becomes the fifth head coach in El Paso Locomotive FC history.\n\nBoth DiGiulio and Gonzalez expressed excitement about leading the next chapter of the club as the Locomotive continue building their roster ahead of the 2026 season.\n\n“I’m extremely excited,” Gonzalez said. “I’ve been in quite a long journey, and I’ve been in many different environments for this opportunity, and I don’t take it lightly to be part of the community of El Paso. And our goal is to have success and win trophies, but also to develop young and veteran players to become a team and be good in the community.”\n\n“I have a real love for the sport,” DiGiulio said. “I have a real love for the league. I think the USL is a tremendous opportunity in the future. I believe what we have coming in the next several years is going to be special. My goal and our goal is to be one of those clubs that are the elite thought of clubs in USL.”\n\nEl Paso will open the season on March 7, hosting Colorado Springs Switchbacks FC at Southwest University Park.",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M's 2026 offensive line will feature four new starters after four 2025 veterans will depart due to expired eligibility, combined with declaring for the 2026 NFL Draft. Just a week after the transfer portal opened, head coach Mike Elko and O-line coach Adam Cushing went to work, landing four likely replacements, including former Aggie commit and LSU sophomore guard Coen Echols.\n\nWhile this group looks all but finished, Monday's news that former Texas A&M recruiting target and Colorado sophomore tackle Jordan Seaton will enter the transfer portal likely has every Power 4 coaching staff scrambling to arrange a visit in the coming days, including Mike Elko.\n\nSeaton, a five-star prospect in the 2024 recruiting class, spent last season as Colorado's starting left tackle, appearing in nine games, allowing just two sacks and seven total pressures, earning a Pro Football Focus pass pro grade of 83.9, including prolific grades of 91 against Houston and 91.5 against TCU.\n\nOn his way to becoming a first-round pick in the 2028 or 2029 NFL Draft, wherever he chooses to play next should be based on his development track. Immediately after the announcement, On3's Pete Nakos revealed that sources have told him that Oregon and Texas, two teams in need of starting-level tackles, are the primary contenders this early in the process, but also stated that Ole Miss, Texas Tech, LSU, Miami, and Texas A&M are also in the mix.\n\nKnowing that his NIL value is anywhere between $1 million and $2 million.5 mllion, give or take, I can safely say that Elko will at least \"kick the tires\" on the elite left tackle, even though the staff seems content with what they currently have in the building.\n\nNEW: Colorado OL Jordan Seaton plans to enter the NCAA transfer portal, @PeteNakos reports. \n\nSeaton was as Five-Star Plus+ in the 2024 class.https://t.co/MvGJiwwtfH pic.twitter.com/D4juA1jU4b\n\n— On3 (@On3sports) January 13, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M should be in the mix for Colorado transfer OL Jordan Seaton",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M's 2026 wide receiver rotation is all but complete after landing a massive commitment from Alabama transfer wideout Isaiah Horton, who, after entering the portal on Thursday, took one visit to College Station this weekend, and announced his intention to play for the Aggies on Sunday night.\n\nLast season, Texas A&M's one and only weakness in its wide receiver rotation was the lack of size on the boundary, which also hurt the red zone offense, lacking a 50/50 deep shot threat that could stretch the field and help starting quarterback Marcel Reed spread the ball around at every level of the field.\n\nWith the return of star wide receiver Mario Craver, along with ascending wideouts Ashton Bethel-Roman and Terry Bussey, combined with several incoming freshmen, speed and separation aren't an issue, and Horton provides stability as a man-beater on the outside to create chunk gains and open up the offense.\n\nLast season, Marcel Reed threw for 3,192 yards and 25 touchdowns, with seven of those scores coming off deep shots of 20 yards or more, while his 39% completion percentage on those throws should improve with Horton's size posing an advantage. While five of his eleven interceptions came between the numbers, four were thrown along the left boundary, mainly due to the lack of size at wide receiver against average-sized defensive backs.\n\nMario Craver is one of the fastest players in college football, but is a mere 5'9\", and should have his best season yet in the Z or slot receiver role with Hortmon on the field, as the coverage will now have to focus on the Alabama transfer, especially if he finds early success in SEC play.\n\nBarring any changes, including Auburn transfer WR Malcolm Simmon's impending decision and Colorado transfer receiver Dre'Lon Miller's visit to College Station this weekend, Isaiah Hortmon looks like the final piece of the puzzle for Texas A&M's 2026 wide receiver corps.\n\nIf the 2025 Texas A&M WR group had one weakness, it was their lack of a big-bodied WRs who can be an outside man beater and grab 50-50 balls. New A&M WR Isaiah Horton can be that guy and led Alabama with eight receiving TDs in 2025. pic.twitter.com/Ui86ViPjcQ\n\n— Carter Karels (@CarterKarels) January 11, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M's 2026 WR corps looks complete after adding Isaiah Horton",

    "description": "It joins over 400 other centers in Texas and signals the growth of the tech scene in Medina County.",
    "fullText": "Yet another data center will soon emerge near the Far Westside of San Antonio, according to a recent Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) filing. It's set to further the Lone Star State's reputation as a tech cluster.\n\nThe quaint town of Castroville, with a population of just over 3,000, will soon house a $400 million development owned by Microsoft. Online records show that the project, named SAT 82, will take up roughly 195,000 square feet in Medina County.\n\nAlthough it's only a one-story building, it will take nearly two years to build, according to the TDLR. Construction at the spot, 3580 FM 471 North, will begin on Thursday, August 13, 2026. A visit to the property revealed that equipment and a welcome poster were already on site. An open field, a two-lane road, and residential properties sit nearby.\n\nIn time, the structure will likely take on the look of a windowless warehouse. It may be hard for residents to get a clear glimpse of the center, as each contains extensive fencing around its perimeters for safety and security purposes, Microsoft's website states.\n\nSAT 82 joins six others in Medina County, according to the TDLR: SAT 80, SAT 81, SAT 89/90, SAT 93, SAT 94, and another with the title SAT 82, but with a different address.\n\nThe centers provide the infrastructure needed to open a phone application, join a virtual Zoom meeting, play an online game, and more. According to the company's website, they also allow the company's Azure cloud platform, AI, and collaboration tools to continue operating as normal.\n\nEarlier this fall, community members in a private Redbird Ranch neighborhood Facebook group voiced concerns over Microsoft's presence in the area. A few users worried the company's projects would worsen traffic. Others highlighted the massive amount of water that data centers use.\n\nIn a 2024 sustainability report, Microsoft said that its water consumption in 2023 - which includes but is not limited to data centers - increased by 1.7 billion gallons from the previous year, coming in at 2.1 billion gallons. The company attributed the increase to its business growth.\n\n\"Improvements as part of our Redmond campus modernization project are estimated to yield over 50% reduction in water use for new facilities,\" it continued in the report.\n\nConstruction on the property is expected to wrap up by 2028, according to the TDLR.\n\nThis article originally published at Microsoft bets $400M on tiny Texas town with new massive data center.",

Manziel was in attendance for multiple contests at Kyle Field in 2025, while also spending time with current Texas A&M quarterback Marcel Reed, who displayed much improvement this season at the helm and will return to play for the Maroon and White for his junior season.\n\nThe year didn't conclude as the Aggies had wished, but head coach Mike Elko has led the program to historic heights in just his second season coaching in Bryan-College Station, Texas. Elko's squad secured the school's first 11-0 start since 1992 and its first playoff appearance in 2025.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Dylan on X: @dylanmflippo.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Former Texas A&M QB Johnny Manziel explains \"College Gameday\" absence",

    "description": "Texas A&M HC Mike Elko hosted several notable transfers this weekend, including WR Isaiah Horton and Illinois DL Angelo McCullom.",
    "fullText": "Texas A&M (13-3, 3-0 SEC) stayed undefeated in the SEC after defeating Oklahoma 83-76 on Saturday night, aided by four Aggies scoring in double figures, led by senior forward Rashuan Agee's 16 points and 12 rebounds for his seventh double-double on the year. In attendance, Texas A&M football head coach Mike Elko hosted several key transfer portal players, who collectively enjoyed one of the weekend's best games.\n\nOn Friday night, it was revealed that the Aggies were set to host Alabama transfer wide receiver Isaiah Horton amid Auburn star receiver Cam Coleman's impending decision, and while Horton was not in attendance for the game, Elko was accompanied by former Aggie recruiting target and Colorado transfer receiver Dre'Lon Miller and Illinois transfer defensive tackle Angelo McCullom.\n\nAnother confirmed visitor, Miami transfer DL Donta Simpson Jr, further proves that Elko and his staff are looking add more beef to the defensive line after landing standout transfer edge rushers Ryan Henderson and Anto Naka, who will look to replace unanimous All-American Cashius Howell. Landing either McCullom or Simpson, or both, would complete the 2026 defensive line room.\n\nCam Coleman's recent visit to Alabama could put the Crimson Tide ahead of the Aggies, Texas, and Texas Tech, but that's yet to be determined after the Alabama native returned home before making his final decision. Landing Isaiah Horton wouldn't just be insurance if Coleman isn't an option, but an elite addition to an already established, yet undersized WR Room.\n\nLastly, Dre'Lon Miller is a familiar face who was underutilized during his time at Colorado, and while he doesn't possess Horton's size, his speed and versatility would make up for KC Concepcion's departure.\n\nUpdate: Some conflicting info on the Horton ID in video. Certain on Miller and McCollum. https://t.co/yimkbovBC5\n\n— 𝕋𝕣𝕒𝕧𝕚𝕤 𝕃.

    "fullText": "According to On3’s Hayes Fawcett, the Texas Longhorns have landed a commitment from linebacker Rasheem Biles out of the NCAA transfer portal. Biles spent the last two seasons with the Pitt Panthers, turning into an All-ACC player. Steve Sarkisian and new defensive coordinator Will Muschamp now take over his talents, hoping it translates in the SEC.\n\nLinebacker has been a position of importance for Texas in the transfer portal this offseason. There has been plenty of turnover there, both due to the 2026 NFL Draft and guys leaving for other schools. Somebody with the ability to bring an immediate impact was needed in Austin, and Biles is the guy.\n\nBiles played in 10 games last season for Pitt, starting in nine of them. A total of 101 tackles, 17 tackles for a loss, and 4.5 interceptions proved to be good enough for second-team All-ACC honors. You can add in two interceptions (both of which were returned for touchdowns), six passes defended, two forced fumbles, and a fumble recovery. Basically, Biles was all over the field this past year.\n\nIf those stats were not enough, the On3 Industry Transfer Portal rankings believe one of the very best is heading to Texas. Biles is a four-star prospect and the No. 16 overall player to enter this cycle. Nobody is ranked higher when it comes to the linebacker position, either.\n\nPlenty of other schools were interested in Biles’ commitment during the transfer process. The likes of Colorado, Miami, Michigan, and Ohio State were a part of the discussion at one point. Instead, Texas found a way to get this one over the finish line.\n\nThe Longhorns are coming off a disappointing season, going 9-3 and missing the College Football Playoff. Sarkisian is working to retool the roster so the same fate is not shared at the conclusion of the 2026 season. Plenty of work remains but snagging somebody like Biles is a massive step in the right direction.\n\nTexas will open the ’26 campaign on Sept. 5 vs. Texas State, where you can assume it will be debut day for Biles. One week later will grab all the attention, though, as Ohio State comes to Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium for the first time since 2006.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

    "fullText": "Texas A&M's 2026 running back room could feature a new face from the transfer portal, and while Baylor transfer back Bryson Washington made his way to College Station this weekend, Washington is now in the mix for the Texas native, which have have made a significant push this week. However, this doesn't rule out the Aggies landing a transfer running back, as a new name has emerged.\n\nAccording to AggieYell insider Jaxson Callaway, Texas A&M is now targeting Michigan State transfer running back Makhi Frazier, who is reportedly coming off a Friday visit to Ohio State. While this may seem daunting, the Aggies have won multiple transfer battles against the Buckeyes this month. Still, adding another running back isn't A&M's top priority compared to other programs.\n\nWashington is still the No. 1 running back target for head coach Mike Elko and his staff, and Callaway is right to state that the rest of the RB portal market will depend on Washington's choice regarding which way the Huskies will go.\n\n\"At the moment, much of the running back market appears to be waiting on Washington’s decision.\"\n\nFocusing on Frazier, the McKinney, Texas native is listed at 5'10\" and nearly 220 pounds, and is coming off an impressive 2025 sophomore campaign after rushing for 520 yards and two touchdowns, averaging 4.5 yards per carry.\n\nPer Pro Football Focus, Frazier earned a solid offensive grade (74.8) and a rushing grade (77.6), which bodes well for his future as a potential starting or No. 2 running back. Frazier will continue to be a name to watch, but until Bryson Washington makes his decision, both players will be the top backs on the Aggies' radar.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Transfer RB Makhi Frazier has emerged as a Texas A&M target",

In total, there are 15 finalists for the honor.\n\nDuring the 2025 campaign, Manning completed 248-of-404 passes for 3,163 yards. While completing 61 percent of his passing attempts, the Longhorns' star found the end zone 26 times and etched his way into the record books.

The Longhorns ' sophomore recorded 399 rushing yards on 92 carries. That was the second-most on the team, trailing only Quintrevion Wisner, who is now a Seminole. Regardless of the opponent, Manning found a way to make an impact.\n\nAlthough Manning had an up-and-down start, he got better as the season went on.

    "fullText": "The Alabama Crimson Tide will host the Texas Longhorns at Coleman Coliseum on Saturday night.\n\nThe Tide enter the matchup following a Top 15 road loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, as a multitude of injuries ultimately cost Alabama the game. Labaron Philon Jr. recorded 18 points on 5-of-9 shooting despite playing just 19 minutes, as the star guard left the game with full-body cramps and was unable to return in the second half.\n\nAden Holloway and Latrell Wrightsell could see an increase in playing time, should Philon remain sidelined, but the Tide will look to get the sharpshooter back from injury as soon as possible, starting with this game against Texas.\n\nHere are three bold takes for Alabama's matchup against Texas.\n\nHolloway recorded 22 points on 9-of-18 shooting during Wednesday night's loss, as the junior guard was able to step up and play at an elite level following Philon's injury. The former Auburn star could thrive once again if Philon is unable to play, as the sharpshooter has proven to shine with an increased workload on numerous occasions in the past. Holloway is currently shooting an impressive 46.7% from behind the arc, as the star will look to stay hot on Saturday evening.\n\nSherrell has played a critical role on both ends of the floor for the Crimson Tide. The talented big man currently leads the team in blocks with 2.8 per game, and Sherrell's presence on the glass has undoubtedly been missed while he has been sidelined. The sophomore forward could be in prime position for a major performance should he return on Saturday night, as the Tide continue to slowly get healthier as the season progresses.\n\nAllen has continued to turn heads throughout the first few months of the 2025-26 season. The impressive freshman led the Crimson Tide in points with 25 during Wednesday night's loss in Nashville, as Allen has quickly earned himself a much larger role and has thrived in recent weeks. Allen could benefit from Philon's injury should he remain out on Saturday, but ultimately the freshman could still be in for another big night nonetheless.\n\nContact/Follow us @RollTideWire on X, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Alabama news, notes and opinion.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Roll Tide Wire: Alabama basketball bold predictions for game vs. Texas Longhorns",

The college student was found dead at the bottom of an apartment complex. The Austin Police Department suggested that Aguilera took her own life, though the cheerleader's mother strongly disagreed.\n\nStephanie Rodriguez, the mother of the deceased cheerleader, ripped Austin Police for their investigation.\n\n“Please don’t believe this lazy investigator and Investigation!” Stephanie Rodriguezwrote on Facebook.\n\nNow, the parents of the cheerleader have filed a $1 million lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed against Austin Blacks Rugby Club and the University of Texas’ Latin Economics and Business Association. The seven-figure lawsuit accuses the two school organizations of allegedly serving their daughter alcohol before her death.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Aguilera was served her first drink around 6 p.m. She was allegedly continued to be served drinks for several hours, before stumbling away. Aguilera ended up at an apartment where she was supposed to spend the night. Ultimately, she fell to her death around midnight.\n\n“We believe even more today this was not a suicide as has been suggested by police. This was either an accident or something much more sinister,” Tony Buzbee, lead attorney with the Buzbee Law Firm, who is representing Aguilera’s parents, said at a press conference.\n\nHe added: “If the police department will not do its job, then we will do it for them.\"\n\nThe police said that they found a deleted suicide note on Aguilera's phone. However, attorneys representing Aguilera's family say that it was just a drafted essay.\n\nAn official cause of death has yet to be released. An investigation into the death remains to be underway.",

Love it or hate it, it isn’t going anywhere—and every program in the country feels its impact.\n\nBut the portal also gives players the same flexibility coaches enjoy: the ability to leave when a better opportunity presents itself. On Thursday, former Texas A&M redshirt junior tight end Theo Melin Öhrström found exactly that, landing with an ACC‑bound program not too far from Aggieland.\n\nAccording to On3Sports’ Hayes Fawcett, Öhrström will join the SMU Mustangs for the 2026 season and is expected to arrive in Dallas with up to two years of eligibility remaining. The former four‑star prospect stayed through the coaching transition in College Station and continued to make steady progress, earning more snaps as his career unfolded. He was firmly in the mix to start for the Aggies in 2026, but ultimately opted for a fresh start.\n\nAt SMU, he’ll have a much clearer path as the main focus at the position and can serve as the veteran presence in a young tight end room next season.\n\nYou can see his announcement below.\n\nBREAKING: Texas A&M transfer TE Theo Melin Ohrstrom has Committed to SMU, he tells @On3Sports\n\nHe totaled 352 yards and 3 TDs in his time with the Aggieshttps://t.co/RlUbB6Fk7q pic.twitter.com/sYJsfYzlSk\n\n— Hayes Fawcett (@Hayesfawcett3) January 8, 2026\n\nThe NCAA football transfer portal opened Jan. 2 and runs through Jan. 16.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions.

Kewan Lacy pitched in with 110 all-purpose yards and two touchdowns of his own. Zxavian Harris and Princewill Umanmielen helped the defense total nine tackles for loss, their most in a single game this season.\n\nLSU isn’t going to make it easy on them moving forward, though, as offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. and running backs coach Kevin Smith weren’t with the team for several days but will be allowed to continue coaching.\n\nNo. 10 Miami Hurricanes\nConference: ACC\nHead Coach: Mario Cristobal\nRecord: 12–2\n\nMiami secured the biggest upset in the history of the CFP on New Year’s Eve.\n\nThe Hurricanes have ripped off six consecutive victories, including their final three against No. 24 Pitt in the regular season finale, No. 7 Texas A&M in the first round and No. 2 Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl.\n\nIt’ll be difficult for anyone to defeat them if they can continue to average nearly five yards per carry and allow just single-digit points per game.\n\nDIFFERENCE MAKER‼️#GoCanes | @CFBPlayoff pic.twitter.com/bjHXTVpxyT\n\n— Miami Hurricanes Football (@CanesFootball) January 2, 2026\n\nOle Miss\nQB Trinidad Chambliss\nRB Kewan Lacy\nWR Harrison Wallace III\nWR Deuce Alexander\nTE Dae’Quan Wright\nDL Princewill Umanmielen\nDL Will Echoles\nLB Suntarine Perkins\nLB T.J.

    "description": "\"There’s a lot of story to be written.\"",
    "fullText": "A critically endangered large bird is getting a helping hand with the opening of a large sanctuary on the Gulf Coast.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that the Wolfberry Whooping Crane Sanctuary will provide a vital wintering ground for the 550 cranes that migrate each winter to Texas from Canada.\n\nThe $8.4 million land acquisition was a joint venture between different conservation groups. It marks a key next step in the crane's recovery from the brink of extinction in the 1940s.\n\nThe whooping crane's numbers dipped to just 21 individuals in the wild, 16 in Texas, because of extensive destruction of wetlands and illegal hunting.\n\nRising sea levels are further eroding the crane's breeding grounds. They were one of the first species listed under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.\n\nCarter Crouch, director of the Gulf Coast programs for the International Crane Foundation, hailed the progress made while acknowledging the challenges ahead:\n\n\"We have a long way to go still, so there's a lot of story to be written, and I'm super excited to be a small part of that.\"\n\nThe whooping crane is a striking bird that typically stands about five feet tall with white feathers and a distinctive red patch on its head. Its name reveals its other defining characteristic: very loud vocalizations.\n\nLike other cranes, they play an important role in maintaining the balance of the food web in wetlands by keeping prey populations under control and spreading nutrients. They are also considered an indicator species, meaning their presence is a sign of a healthy ecosystem.\n\nWhile still in a precarious state, they are resilient birds with a long lifespan, so there's good reason to be optimistic for their future.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nAnother promising note is another rare crane's remarkable comeback on the other side of the world. It shows what's possible with effective local and international cooperation to protect threatened species.\n\nSupporting such efforts with your time or money can make a huge difference.\n\nAn Instagram post from Saving Cranes (@savingcranes) about the story garnered several positive comments.\n\n\"Great win conserving one of the earth's great habitats for wildlife for future generations!\" read one.\n\nAnother happy commenter added, \"Bravo! Thank You! Congratulations!\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "KeShawn Murphy thought he had hit a ridiculous deep buzzer-beater to lift Auburn past Texas A&M on Tuesday night.\n\nMurphy, with Auburn down by two points, caught an inbounds pass with just 0.6 seconds left on the clock, turned and fired. His shot was perfect, and sparked a massive celebration at Neville Arena. The shot looked like it was one of the first truly great buzzer-beaters of the college basketball season, several months before March even hit.\n\nBut unfortunately for Murphy and the Tigers, a review from the officials determined that the release was just a little too late. Murphy didn’t get the shot off in time, and the points were called off. That gave the Aggies the 90-88 road win, and left them celebrating in front of a stunned arena instead.\n\nWILD ENDING 🤯 \n\nThis supposed buzzer-beater from Auburn was overturned after review to give Texas A&M the win. pic.twitter.com/oxjZEHlWGH\n\n— SEC Network (@SECNetwork) January 7, 2026\n\n\"I don't have a clear understanding still,\" Auburn coach Steven Pearl said, via WSFA12's Rosie Langello-Hodgens. \"I still gotta gather more information and get an understanding as to what their determination was ... Just from the angles that I saw, it looked like the ball was out of his hands on the red light, on the scoreboard that we were looking at. But I would imagine that they had a different angle they were looking at to determine the ball wasn't out of his hands.\"\n\nPearl had a conversation with the SEC after the game, and he was seen meeting with athletic director John Cohen and officials on the court well after speaking with reporters.\n\nTexas A&M rallied from a 16-point hole to grab the win over the Tigers, which got them to 12-3 on the season and kept them a perfect 2-0 in SEC play. Pop Isaacs led the way with 21 points off the bench after he shot 7-of-12 from the field, and Jacari Lane added 17 points and seven rebounds. The Aggies have now won five straight entering Saturday's game with Oklahoma.\n\nKeyshawn Hall led Auburn with 32 points and 12 rebounds in the loss, and Kevin Overton finished with 16 points. Murphy had eight points and eight rebounds. The Tigers have now lost four of their last six, and fell to 9-6 on the season — which is the first under Pearl, who took over for his father, longtime coach Bruce Pearl, this past offseason. They’ll head into Saturday’s game with No. 15 Arkansas without an SEC win looking to avoid what would be the program’s first three-game losing skid since 2023.",

    "fullText": "Texas transfer redshirt freshman wide receiver Parker Livingstone has committed to rival Oklahoma, On3’s Hayes Fawcett and Pete Nakos report.\n\nLivingstone, who was a four-star recruit out of Lovejoy in the 2024 class, exploded onto the scene for the Longhorns in 2025. The Lucas, TX native hauled in 29 receptions for 516 yards and six touchdowns. He caught two passes for 29 yards in Texas’ 23-6 win over Oklahoma on Oct. 11.\n\nThe departure of Livingstone came as a big blow to Texas starting quarterback Arch Manning, who was Livingstone’s roommate in Austin. As news of his transfer emerged, Manning posted an Instagram story of him and Livingstone with a teary-eyed emoji.\n\nLivingstone now joins an Oklahoma program fresh off an appearance in the College Football Playoff. The Sooners went up 17-0 over Alabama in their First Round matchup, but were outscored 34-7 over the remainder of the game in a 34-24 loss.\n\nDespite the loss, head coach Brent Venables made it clear how proud he was of both the players returning next season and those moving on: “We couldn’t have done it if they didn’t stick with it, if they didn’t continue to believe when a lot of the things were going on around them,” Venables elaborated. “They could’ve bowed out, and they chose not to.”\n\nAlthough it appeared he could be one of the top quarterback prospects in the 2026 NFL Draft following a red-hot start to the season, quarterback John Mateer will likely return to Norman for his redshirt senior. season. In 12 games this season, Mateer completed 62.2% of passes for 2,885 yards and 14 touchdowns with 11 interceptions. He also totaled 431 yards and eight scores on the ground.\n\nMateer addressed his future immediately following the Sooners’ loss to the Crimson Tide. He was non-committal when discussing what’s next for his football career. “I haven’t really thought about it yet,” Mateer said. “I’m pretty sure I’ll take some time and weigh all the options and we’ll see.”\n\nESPN’s Kirk Herbstreit however implored Mateer to return to Norman next season. “Why would he leave a place that’s become home? I guess if someone paid him,” Herbstreit said. “My guess is, he’s going back to OU.”\n\nWith Mateer and Livingstone leading the OU offense, back-to-back College Football Playoff appearances are certainly the expectation for the Sooner faithful.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.\n\nThe On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.",

    "description": "Texas A&M left guard Chase Bisontis has declared for the 2026 NFL Draft after three impressive seasons.",
    "fullText": "Texas A&M's offensive line will look very different in 2026, as head coach Mike Elko and O-line coach Adam Cushing will need to replace four starters, now including junior left guard Chase Bisontis, who has officially declared for the 2026 NFL Draft after three successful seasons in College Station.\n\nA New Jersey native, Bisontis chose the Aggies over Rutgers in the 2023 recruiting class, bringing elite size and versatility at 6'5\" and 315 pounds, and during his first season with the Aggies, Bisontis started at right tackle amid former head coach Jimbo Fisher's final season at the helm.\n\nAfter Fisher was dismissed, Mike Elko felt that Adam Cushing was the perfect choice to help Bisontis reach his full potential, slotting him at left guard, where he has dominated ever since. Logging 1,962 snaps in his Texas A&M career, including 795 snaps, all at left guard during the 2025 season. Bisontis's elite strength will quickly translate to the next level, knowing that NFL scouts see him as a \"plug-and-play\" option at left or right guard.\n\nPro Football Focus graded Bisontis as an above-average pass protector (70.7) and average run blocker (62.7). Still, these grades, compared to most SEC starting guards, prove the level of defensive competition within the conference.\n\nOver the last three days, Texas A&M landed commitments from LSU transfer guard Coen Echols and South Carolina guard Trovon Baugh, which now makes even more sense given today's news. Needing size and SEC experience at left and right guard is key to avoiding a substantial drop-off in the trenches, and credit to Mike Elko for preparing for the inevitable.\n\nTexas A&M OL Chase Bisontis has declared for the 2026 NFL Draft, per his Instagram (chase_bisontis) 👍 #GigEm @CBisontis pic.twitter.com/iQfPNJsSQI\n\n— Luke Evangelist (@lukeevangelist_) January 6, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M star OL Chase Bisontis has declared for the 2026 NFL Draft",

    "fullText": "Jan 6 (Reuters) - One of the first police officers on the scene of the 2022 attack at a Texas elementary school that killed 19 students and two ​teachers is now the first to stand trial, accused of failing to act ‌as the gunman continued one of the deadliest mass killings targeting students in U.S. history.\n\nOpening arguments were to begin ‌Tuesday in the trial of Adrian Gonzales, 52, who was a member of the school district police force. Hundreds of officers from local, state and federal agencies waited 77 minutes before entering a classroom where the gunman was holed up. Teachers and children made lengthy calls to 911 emergency ⁠services, saying they were in the ‌room with the gunman and surrounded by bodies.\n\nGonzales was charged in 2024 with 29 counts of child endangerment, according to his indictment, which said ‍that he \"failed to engage, distract, and delay the shooter\" and that he also failed \"to follow his active shooter training to respond to gun fire by advancing toward the gun fire.\"\n\nEach count carries the possibility of ​two years in prison. Gonzales has pleaded not guilty. Gonzales' attorney, Nico LaHood, has said ‌that his client showed up to help children, and that he did in fact help many evacuate.\n\nPedro \"Pete\" Arredondo, the former chief of the Uvalde schools police and the person who investigators say was the officer in charge of the scene, faces 10 counts of the same charge. His trial has not yet been scheduled.\n\nState and federal investigations into the shooting found that officers ⁠left the 18-year-old gunman alone inside the classroom with ​children while weighing how to confront him.\n\nDebates between proponents ⁠of gun control measures and defenders of the constitutional right to bear arms have resulted in few restrictions on firearms in the United States compared to other industrialized ⁠nations.\n\nFormer U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, in remarks made while presenting the federal report on Uvalde in 2024, said ‌that \"lives would have been saved\" had the police immediately confronted the gunman.",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M landed its seventh transfer addition since the portal opened on Monday afternoon, securing its second offensive line commitment, as South Carolina guard Trovon Baugh will head to College Station this spring, and I can safely say that this one came out of nowhere. After landing LSU guard and former Texas A&M commit Coen Echols, head coach Mike Elko has added more beef in the trenches.\n\nWith starting left tackle Trey Zuhn, right guard Ar'maj Reed-Adams, and right tackle Dametreous Crownover all departing for the NFL Draft, landing two experienced offensive linemen was crucial before entering the spring season, while left guard Chase Bisontis has yet to decide his playing future. For those who aren't familiar with Baugh, he started 11 of 12 games at right guard for the Gamecocks last season, logging 611 snaps, while his overall performance is a mixed bag with more positives than negatives.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Focus, Baugh earned average grades, but did finish the year with four 80-plus pass protection grades, and earned at least 50 or above grades as a run blocker, proving that there's still plenty of room for improvement. On paper, with Adams leaving, Baugh will likely compete with Coen Echols and sophomore guard Blake Ivy for the starting right guard spot.\n\nStanding at 6'3\" and 335 pounds, Baugh possesses NFL size and strength, but still needs to refine his technique to reach his full potential.

    "description": "I followed a partner to Texas from California, then left both the state and relationship. I learned an important lesson about making my own decisions.",
    "fullText": "Shortly after earning my Bachelor's degree, I did what any confused 21-year-old would do: I moved to be with a partner.\n\nThe decision surprised a lot of people in my life. My dad raised his eyebrows at my choice to move for love and to make Texas my home.\n\nAfter all, I'd always dreamed of moving to New York, where I'd launch my writing career.\n\nHowever, moving to Texas seemed like a good option at the time. It's where my long-distance partner was living and working, and I was fresh out of college and eager to leave my California hometown.\n\nLooking back now, I was leaning on a romanticized version of what moving would mean — a fresh start and a deepening of our LDR — instead of thinking about what I really wanted.\n\nI arrived in northern Texas during a mid-summer nightmare of humidity. I couldn't walk outside without feeling like I'd just entered a sauna — a sharp contrast to California's dry heat.\n\nFrom the very beginning, I tried to find community and make living here work, convincing myself I'd adjust if I just put in enough effort.\n\nBut I had a tough time finding things to do in my new suburb. Quiet nights and weekends left me daydreaming about New York City and its seemingly endless array of activities and events even more.\n\nCrucially, I also found it incredibly difficult to meet anyone who felt similar to me.\n\nMy Dallas suburb felt much more conservative than my California hometown, and a lot of the people in our neighborhood were avid churchgoers, whereas I'm not religious.\n\nAround this time, too, I was coming to terms with the fact that I also liked women romantically. I struggled to find the kinds of queer spaces that seemed more plentiful in larger cities and bluer states.\n\nAs much as I tried to appreciate the mountainless views and endless selection of barbecue, I struggled to connect with my new town — and I couldn't stop thinking about the life I wanted in New York.\n\nSix months in, I took a quick trip back to California to visit my dad.\n\nTaking some time away from Texas made me confront the truth: I couldn't stay there anymore.\n\nThroughout my entire time in the state, I'd been daydreaming about packing up my things and living in New York City. My partner, on the other hand, wanted life in the country, and we just ended up not being compatible.\n\nThe Lone Star State helped bring all of these realizations to light.\n\nI knew that if I had chosen to stay, I'd continue to feel like a stranger in my own life. I realized that I'd rather take on the \"sunk cost\" of moving than stay in a place and relationship that didn't suit me.\n\nI learned a lot about myself during this time — including the fact that, maybe unsurprisingly, a suburb in northern Texas was not a great long-term fit for me. The biggest lesson I learned, though, was never to give up my own hopes and dreams for the sake of a relationship.\n\nDon't get me wrong: Moving for a partner can work for some people, but at 21, I learned the importance of making life decisions with my own wants and needs in mind.\n\nNow, almost a decade later, I'm writing this from my New York City apartment. I'm in a city where I've found my purpose, the love of my life, and most importantly, happiness.\n\nLeaving Texas turned out to be one of the best decisions I've ever made.",

    "fullText": "AT&T is ditching downtown Dallas for the suburbs.\n\nThe telecom giant said Monday it plans to move its global headquarters to a newly constructed corporate campus in Plano, Texas, starting in 2028.\n\nThe new global headquarters would consolidate three existing locations in the Dallas area, including the downtown skyscraper that has been AT&T's home since 2008.\n\nA spokesperson told Business Insider that the new facilities will be designed for \"collaboration, innovation, and engagement,\" and that the company still believes the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area is a good location for business.\n\nLike many companies that have instituted full-time return-to-office policies, AT&T has experienced shortages of workspace and parking. AT&T said it has been developing the plan for the new headquarters for the past year.\n\nSeveral north Dallas suburbs are among the fastest-growing cities and towns in the US, and AT&T's spokesperson said the new campus will be closer to where many employees live.\n\nIn a memo to employees, which Business Insider obtained, CEO John Stankey acknowledged feedback about expectations for \"well-maintained and functional workspaces\" that were raised in an engagement survey last year.\n\n\"This is an investment intended to put the employee experience at the center of our workspace,\" Stankey said.",

Standing at 6'3\" and 255 pounds, Gregory would replace outgoing edge Rylan Kennedy, possessing a similar build and having already proven an ability to rush the passer at a high level.\n\nAccording to On3's Hayes Fawcett, Texas A&M has shown interest and could set up a visit as soon as next week. Right now, Gregory is visiting Texas Tech, while Florida State, USC, and Miami are also in the mix. Texas Tech will be tough to outbid if Gregory sees the Red Raiders as his top destination, especially given Miami's continued CFP contention.\n\nPopular transfer EDGE Wendell Gregory is drawing interest from Miami, Texas A&M, USC, Florida State, Texas Tech, and others, his agents @ed_waz & @dwoot8 tell @On3sports\n\nHe’s currently in Lubbock for his first visit\n\nNo. 14 Player in the Portal (per On3)https://t.co/RlUbB6Fk7q pic.twitter.com/nJcm6YD9iI\n\n— Hayes Fawcett (@Hayesfawcett3) January 3, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M could host Oklahoma State transfer Edge Wendell Gregory soon",

    "title": "Micah's takeaways from a dominant week for the Big Ten",
    "description": "Indiana embarrassed Alabama and Oregon shut out Texas Tech. The Big Ten showed it has the best teams in CFB and is guaranteed to play for the title",
    "fullText": "It was a great week for the Big Ten The national championship game is guaranteed to have a team that resides in the Big Ten Conference. The title game won't feature two Big Ten teams, but there is no doubt that the best game in this playoff and the best game this season might be the upcoming semifinal between two Big Ten teams, Indiana and Oregon.\n\nHere are my takeaways from the Big Ten from this Week's bowl games:\n\nFrom wins like Iowa over Vandy, Illinois over Tennessee, a high-powered offense, all the way to Indiana beating Alabama, the Big Ten showcased they are the best conference in the country. The Big Ten lost Ohio State as a representative, but with the matchup between Oregon and Indiana, that could very well be the team that wins it all. Indiana very well looks like the best team remaining by a wide margin. Texas did get the best of Michigan, but everyone is clearly aware of what has been going on in Michigan prior to that bowl game. It is safe to say that the Big Ten runs college football.\n\nAgainst Alabama, Fernando Mendoza was as good as he could possibly be. Mendoza was 14-16, threw for 192 yards through the air, and threw for 3 passing touchdowns. Many of his other counterparts struggled, while Mendoza continues to win and continues to be the reason why Indiana is winning. At this current moment, Mendoza looks like a sure thing quarterback prospect for the next draft class, and he will make one desperate NFL team very happy.\n\nIndiana was the one team that had a bye week in the College Football Playoff that did not lose. Not only did they not lose to Alabama, but they won the game in the first half. Ty Simpson had no chance, and this was a complete football performance by Indiana and Curt Cignetti. The Hoosiers are undefeated this year, and last season they only lost two games, one of which was in last season's College Football Playoff. Cignetti consistently has this team ready to dominate regardless of the opponent. He has a Big Ten title for the first time in program history, and he is looking for much more this season. This two-year run for Cignetti in Indiana places him as the best coach in college football right now, and it is not close, just like the coaching match between him and Kalen DeBoer on Thursday.\n\nIndiana is a team that has not shown any weakness this season. In games that could have resulted in an upset this season, Indiana has a guy who can win them games in the clutch in Fernando Mendoza. This team has an elite quarterback, they have elite weapons as Omar Cooper Jr. returned versus Alabama, and their defense is just as good as any team left. This team is well coached, and their team is full of players at every level who have been in college football for at least 4 years. The steamrolling of Alabama was a surprise to no one. Indiana made their statement on Thursday and proved it is the team to beat.\n\nThe last time these two teams met, Indiana won 30-20. That game was a battle, and both quarterbacks struggled and faced adversity. Mendoza proved to be the quarterback who battled adversity the best. Against Indiana was the first time Dante Moore struggled and did not have his usual success. For Oregon to win, they will need Dante Moore to be the better quarterback. In all the other areas on their team, Oregon matches up very well against Indiana, and their defense showed that by completely shutting out Texas Tech. Once again, these two teams will deliver one of the best games of this season. In my opinion, whoever wins this game will win the whole thing.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: Big Ten football teams handled the SEC in New Year's bowl games",

Another outstanding performance from Rashaun Agee helped send the Tigers back to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, with their first loss of conference play, as the graduate forward secured a double-double by leading the team with 15 points and 11 rebounds in the 75-72 win over LSU. Guards Rubén Dominguez and Pop Isaacs combined for 24 points, while Ali Dibba secured 12 off the bench.\n\nTexas A&M shot 41.9% from the field and 71.4% from the free-throw line as a unit.

While the Aggies must continue to improve from range, as the team shot just 28.6% from beyond the arc in the win, there are a plethora of exhilarating playmakers in Bryan-College Station, Texas, who want to turn the program around this season. Texas A&M moved to 11-3 with the first victory of the new year, but league play presents more difficult challenges ahead, including games against six teams currently ranked in the top 25.\n\nThe Aggies' next SEC contest takes place on Tuesday, Jan. 6, as McMillan's squad faces the Auburn Tigers at Neville Arena in Auburn, Alabama.

Gideon, a four-year safety at Texas, played for Muschamp in Austin. He was the safeties coach for Steve Sarkisian until 2025, when he left for Atlanta.\n\nAfter running the defense for the Yellow Jackets this season, Gideon is returning to his alma mater. The 36-year-old played safety at Texas from 2008 through 2011. He got his first coaching role in 2014 and has climbed the career ladder for 11 years. Gideon served as the Longhorns’ safety coach for four seasons before accepting his first defensive coordinator position with Georgia Tech.

His defenses are relentless; he absolutely gets the best out of his staff and players and is such an extremely well-respected coach.
