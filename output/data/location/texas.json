    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court in a free speech case on Monday opted not to hear an appeal by a group of residents of a rural Texas county of a judicial decision allowing local officials to remove ​17 books that these officials deemed objectionable from public libraries.\n\nThe justices let stand a lower court's decision allowing the removal of books ‌including ones dealing with themes of race and LGBT identity, from its public library system. The lower court rejected the argument made by the plaintiffs that removing the books was ‌unlawful under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protections against government abridgment of free speech.\n\nThe decision by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals applies to the states of Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi but does not set a nationwide legal precedent.\n\nThere has been a surge in book banning in public schools and public libraries in recent years in many locations around the United States, driven by conservative groups and new state laws limiting what kinds of books children ⁠can access.\n\nLlano County is a rural area about 80 ‌miles (130 km) from the Texas state capital Austin. The dispute began in 2021 when one faction of local residents asked the Llano County library commissioner to remove the disputed books, which covered topics including transgender issues, race and slavery ‍in the United States, puberty and bodily functions like flatulence.\n\nThe 17 works at issue include the 1970 book \"In the Night Kitchen\" by acclaimed author Maurice Sendak due to the depiction of its main character, a boy named Mickey, as nude in some of its illustrations as he visits a surreal kitchen in a dream.\n\nThe library commission ​ordered librarians to comply with the demands, and residents who pushed for the book removals were appointed to a local county board.\n\nA different group ‌of county residents sued to challenge the book ban, alleging their First Amendment rights had been violated.\n\nAt issue is a First Amendment principle called the right to receive information. The Supreme Court long ago concluded that the First Amendment encompasses a fundamental right to receive information and ideas, as it is necessary for the meaningful exercise of other First Amendment rights such as freedom of religion, expression, speech, assembly and the press.\n\nA federal judge in 2023 ordered county officials to restore the disputed books to the library system. But the 5th Circuit in a 10-7 decision reversed the judge's ruling and sided ⁠with the county. The 5th Circuit concluded that public library patrons have no right ​to receive information under the First Amendment.\n\nWriting for the 5th Circuit, Judge Stuart Kyle Duncan ​asserted that \"no one is banning\" books by removing them from libraries.\n\n\"If a disappointed patron can't find a book in the library, he can order it online, buy it from a bookstore or borrow it from a friend,\" wrote Duncan, a ‍judicial appointee of Republican President Donald Trump. \"All ⁠Llano County has done here is what libraries have been doing for two centuries: decide which books they want in their collections.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in a 1982 case that school boards may not remove books because they dislike the ideas contained in those titles. The ⁠justices splintered in their reasoning at that time, leaving the scope of the First Amendment right to receive information unclear.\n\nIn another case, the Supreme Court in June ruled in favor ‌of Christian and Muslim parents in Maryland who sued to keep their elementary school children out of certain classes when ‌storybooks with LGBT characters are read.",

Ron DeSantis on Monday designated one of the largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy groups in the U.S. a “foreign terrorist organization,” following a similar step by Texas last month.\n\nThe directive against the Council on American-Islamic Relations comes in an executive order DeSantis posted on the social media site X. It also gives the same label to the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nNeither CAIR nor the Muslim Brotherhood is designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. government.\n\nThe order instructs Florida agencies to prevent the two groups and those who have provided them material support from receiving contracts, employment and funds from a state executive or cabinet agency.\n\nIn an emailed statement, CAIR and its Florida chapter said the organization plans to sue DeSantis in response to what it called an “unconstitutional” and “defamatory” proclamation.\n\nFounded in 1994, CAIR has 25 chapters around the country.\n\nCAIR last month asked a federal judge to strike down Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's proclamation, saying in a lawsuit that it was “not only contrary to the United States Constitution, but finds no support in any Texas law.”\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood was established in Egypt nearly a century ago and has branches around the world. Its leaders say it renounced violence decades ago and seeks to set up Islamic rule through elections and other peaceful means. Critics, including autocratic governments across the Middle East region, view it as a threat.",

    "fullText": "AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear an appeal on a Texas free speech case that allowed local officials to remove books deemed objectionable from public libraries.\n\nThe case stemmed from a 2022 lawsuit by a group of residents in rural Llano County over the removal from the public library of more than a dozen books dealing with sex, race and gender themes, as well as humorously touching on topics such as flatulence.\n\nA lower federal appeals court had ruled that removing the books did not violate Constitutional free speech protections.\n\nThe case had been closely watched by publishers and librarians across the country. The Supreme Court's decision to not consider the case was criticized by free speech rights groups.\n\nThe Texas case has already been used to ban books in other areas of the country, said Elly Brinkley, staff attorney for U.S. Free Expression Programs at PEN America.\n\n“Leaving the Fifth Circuit’s ruling in place erodes the most elemental principles of free speech and allows state and local governments to exert ideological control over the people with impunity. The government has no place telling people what they can and cannot read,\" Brinkley said.\n\nSam Helmick, president of the American Library Association, said the Supreme Court's decision not to consider the case \"threatens to transform government libraries into centers for indoctrination instead of protecting them as centers of open inquiry, undermining the First Amendment right to read unfettered by viewpoint-based censorship.”\n\nThe Texas case began when a group of residents asked the county library commission to remove the group of books from circulation. The local commission ordered librarians to comply and a separate group of residents sued to keep the books on the shelves.\n\nLlano County, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) northwest of the Texas capital of Austin, has a population of about 20,000. It is mostly white and conservative, with deep ties to agriculture and deer hunting.\n\nThe book titles originally ordered removed included, “Caste: The Origins of Our Discontent” by Isabel Wilkerson; “They Called Themselves the K.K.K: The Birth of an American Terrorist Group,” by Susan Campbell Bartoletti; “In the Night Kitchen” by Maurice Sendak; “It’s Perfectly Normal: Changing Bodies, Growing Up, Sex and Sexual Health” by Robie H. Harris; and “Being Jazz: My Life as a (Transgender) Teen” by Jazz Jennings.\n\nOther titles include “Larry the Farting Leprechaun” by Jane Bexley and “My Butt is So Noisy!” by Dawn McMillan.\n\nA federal judge ordered the county to restore some of the books in 2023, but that decision was reversed earlier this year by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.\n\nThe county at one point briefly considered closing its public libraries rather than return the books to the shelves after the federal judge's initial order.\n\nIn its order on May 23, the appeals court's majority opinion said the decision to remove a book from the library shelf is not a book ban.\n\n“No one is banning (or burning books). If a disappointed patron can't find a book in the library, he can order it online, buy it from a bookstore or borrow it from a friend,” the appeals court opinion said.\n\nLlano County Judge Ron Cunningham, the ranking official in the county, did not immediately respond to an email to his office seeking comment.\n\nHillel Italie contributed from New York City.",
