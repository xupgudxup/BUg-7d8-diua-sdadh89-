    "description": "The young Longhorns couldn’t match the Badgers in a decisive loss.",
    "fullText": "Another deep run in the NCAA Tournament is over for the No. 1 seed Texas Longhorns (26-4) after falling to the No. 3 seed Wisconsin Badgers (28-4) in the Elite Eight on Sunday at Gregory Gymnasium in a 3-1 defeat.\n\nTexas was consistently out of system for the entire match and struggled to consistently match Wisconsin in any area of the game even though the Horns held a statistical edge in several categories. The biggest issue was the subpar performance from junior outside hitter Torrey Stafford, who hit .132 with nine kills and four attacking errors — the Longhorns needed more from their star, outshone on her home court by Badgers standout Mimi Colyer notching a match-high 23 kills on a .309 hitting percentage.\n\nThe young Texas team struggled to find answers across the board as head coach Jerritt Elliott tried to find sparks from his bench, a failed effort.\n\nIn the first set, both teams came out swinging and stayed neck to neck attacking the net at 5-5. True freshman outside hitter Abby Vander Wal aided the Longhorns with four kills during the set, alongside fellow true freshman outside hitter Cari Spears landing three kills in the first set. Texas was able to gain a small lead as Wisconsin continued to capitalize on attacks and force errors to gain a 23-17 lead. Longhorn middle blocker Nya Bunton snagged a two kills for Texas as the match closed out with Wisconsin taking the opening set, 25-22, despite the Longhorns saving five set points.\n\nIn the second set, Wisconsin jumped out to an early 4-2 lead with Colyer snagging early kills. The Longhorns cut the lead to 11-10 by forcing attacking errors, but the Badgers stayed steady, maintaining their lead with outside hitter Grace Egan swinging strong at the net to extending the lead to 18-13. The Longhorns stayed in the match with the leadership of senior outside hitter Whitney Lauenstein tagging four late kills, but the Badges closed the second set, 25-21, having never trailed in it.\n\nAll gas in the intense third set with both teams pumping attack after attack with the Longhorns taking a 8-7 lead. While both teams stayed on each others heel’s by countering each other’s attacks until Longhorn setter Rella Binney served back-to-back aces to put Texas up 15-12. The Longhorns stood strong at the net, forcing Badger errors to close the third set, 25-20, to prolong the match, albeit only briefly.\n\nIn the fourth set, the Longhorns use the momentum from the third set and go on a 4-0 run with kills from Vander Wal and Spears. The Badgers did not lay down as they were able to for errors and counter attack with the aid of outside hitter Una Vajagic to go on a 12-4 run, putting Wisconsin up, 12-8. The Longhorns managed a 4-0 run while libero Ramsey Gary landed an ace bring the match to 18-15, but the Badgers eventually closed the fourth and final set by forcing seven Longhorn errors to end the match, 25-19.",

    "description": "Before hosting Miami in the CFP, Texas A&M Edge Cashius Howell and WR KC Concepcion are projected as first-round NFL Draft selections.",
    "fullText": "Texas A&M (11-1, 7-1 SEC) is just six days away from hosting Miami (FL) (10-2) in the first round of the College Football Playoff, as both teams are headed to the tournament for the first time in program history, and will meet for the third time in the last three seasons.\n\nOn paper, both teams are highly similar, possessing NFL talent on both sides of the ball, and their starting quarterbacks, Marcel Reed and Carson Beck, each threw for 25 touchdowns and 10 interceptions during the regular season, connecting with elite playmakers.\n\nFor the Hurricanes, freshman wideout Malachi Toney is a nightmare matchup. At the same time, Texas A&M transfer wide receivers KC Concepcion and Mario Craver combined for over 1,700 yards and 15 total touchdowns, and are a mismatch for every secondary they've faced this season. With Craver expected to return next season, Concepcion will likely declare for the NFL Draft.\n\nOn defense, Texas A&M edge Cashius Howell and Miami defensive lineman Rueben Bain are both considered top 10 prospects in the 2026 NFL Draft, and have a chance to solidify their standing as elite pass rushers on Saturday afternoon. Either way, both players are headed to the draft regardless of the outcome.\n\nThis week, Pro Football Focus's Trevor Sikkema released his latest 2026 Mock Draft, projecting Cashius Howell as the 6th overall pick to the Washington Commanders, who would join former Texas A&M and future Hall of Fame defensive end Von Miller for at least one season.\n\nThe Commanders defense is in a bad place right now, and it starts up front. Howell will face plenty of skepticism about his draft range, given his very short arms for the position, yet he has earned pass-rush grades above 90.0 in three straight seasons, with win rates above 19.0% over that same span.\n\nConcepcion, who finished his first season in College Station with 57 receptions and a team-high 886 receiving yards and 9 touchdowns, paired with two punt return scores, is the perfect addition for any team looking for a Day 1 starting slot receiver and punt returner. According to Sikkema, the San Francisco 49ers will be looking to replace Debo Samuels for the first time in two seasons.\n\nWithout Deebo Samuel, it feels like the 49ers are missing that go-to yards after catch receiver. They are using running back Christian McCaffrey a lot for that, but it’s not quite the same as scheming things up for a receiver. Concepcion is averaging more than 7.0 yards after the catch this year and has that kind of acceleration and athleticism.\n\nFor the Aggies to have any shot at making it to the quarterfinals against No. 2 Ohio State, both Conecpcion and Howell will need to play their best football.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Two Texas A&M starters projected as first-round NFL Draft picks",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSAN ANTONIO, Texas, Dec. 12 — The Randle Lions have won 30 straight games, heading into Friday night's Texas UIL Class 5A Division II semifinal game at the Alamodome.\n\nThey'll face the Boerne [TX] Greyhounds who enter the contest with a 13-1 record.\n\nRandle is looking to defend its 2024 Class 4A state championship with one of the nation's top running backs in their backfield in junior Landen Williams-Callis.\n\nGame time is set for 8 p.m. EST (7 p.m. CST local).\n\nWATCH ON THE NFHS NETWORK:No. 28/SN No. 14 Randle [Richmond, TX] Lions vs. Boerne [TX] Greyhounds\n\nRandle adds a 32-yard field goal.\n\nAnd that's three quarters in the book. Randle comfortably on its way to return to the state championship game in defense of their 2024 title.\n\nYou-know-who scores on a 42-yard run, and Randle is starting to literally run away with this. And the guy doing the running is Landen Williams-Callis. He's got 202 yards and 5 touchdowns ... so far.\n\nThey're under way in the third quarter, and it's really just turning into another episode of the Landen Williams-Callis show. He's got his fourth touchdown of the night.\n\nBoerne played about as good as you can expect against this big Randle offense. But that late touchdown has made this a much more formidable effort, and Williams-Callis still has three touchdowns in this game.\n\nWilliams-Callis scores his third touchdown of the game from 9 yards out with just 10 seconds remaining before the half. The Lions starting to finally get some separation after getting the Greyhounds' best effort in this first half.\n\nWilliams-Callis scores his second touchdown of the game on a short 2-yard run to put the Lions back on top.\n\nRandle is forced to punt from its own end zone, and it is blocked for a safety. Boerne hanging tough with the defending champions tonight.\n\nWe've got conflicting info on the score with some reports saying it's 10-7. We'll work to clarify that and update here. The video feed for the game is not working tonight.\n\nWith just 5 seconds to play in the first quarter, Boerne gets an answer on the board.\n\nOne-hand TD catch! @HoundFootball QB Grant Sweeney finds WR Zach Frasier, who palms it for the Boerne TD! Much needed for the Greyhounds to get on the board.\n\n10-7 Richmond Randle at the end of 1Q.\n\nWinner to the Texas State Championship. pic.twitter.com/GSuRkXecF5\n\n— Nate Ryan (@nateryansports) December 13, 2025\n\nLanden Williams-Callis scores on a 30-yard run. The PAT is no good, but it's all Lions early.\n\nRandle's first drive stalls, but it's close enough for the Lions to put a field goal on the board.\n\nThe game is under way in San Antonio!\n\nStart time: 8 p.m. EST {7 p.m. CST local)\n\nThe game between Boerne and Randle is being played at the Alamodome.\n\nWATCH ON THE NFHS NETWORK:No. 28/SN No. 14 Randle [Richmond, TX] Lions vs. Boerne [TX] Greyhounds\n\nMORE HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYOFF HEADLINES\n\nFlorida 2025 playoff brackets (7A/6A/5A/4A)\n\nGeorgia 2025 playoff brackets (6A/5A/4A)\n\nLouisiana 2025 playoff brackets (Division I/II)\n\nTexas 2025 playoff brackets (6A/5A/4A)",

    "fullText": "Longtime Democratic strategist James Carville accused Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) of breaking the “first rule of politics” following her announcement that she’s running for Senate.\n\nOn the Politics War Room podcast on Thursday, Carville and co-host Al Hunt expressed some hope for Democrats in the red state of Texas, but Carville laid out his problems with Crockett.\n\n“First of all, it seems like she’s well-educated. It seems like she’s got a lot of energy. But she, to me, she violates the first rule of politics, and that is, in politics, you always make it about the voters and never about yourself,” Carville said.\n\nListening to Crockett, he argued, it’s clear that it’s “a lot more about herself than it is the voters.”\n\nCarville added that Crockett can still be successful in her Senate run and recommended she collect the support of Democrats who have favored voting Republican.\n\n“You can get all the hits. You can get all the clicks. You can get on all of the TV shows. You can get in as long as you’re polemic, but you’re not helping very much,” he said.\n\nCarville still cautioned that “talking incessantly” about yourself is not what wins elections, and he hasn’t been impressed with Crockett’s “framing” and “understanding where people are coming from” on issues.\n\n“We know what wins elections. We just do,” he said. “And what wins elections is not sitting there talking incessantly about yourself. Winning elections is not how many clicks you get or how much overnight fundraising you do. Winning elections is being part of framing issues and understanding where people are coming from, and I don’t think [Congresswoman] Crockett is very good at that. I’ll be very frank.”\n\nCrockett, running with the slogan of “Texas Tough,” said she’s running for the Senate seat currently held by Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) because Democrats need a “bigger voice.” She vowed to focus on issues like affordability.\n\n“There are a lot of people that said, ‘You gotta stay in the House. We need our voice. We need you there,” she told supporters this week. “And I understand. But what we need is a bigger voice.”\n\nThe post James Carville Blasts Fellow Democrat Jasmine Crockett for Violating ‘First Rule of Politics’: ‘I’ll Be Very Frank’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

Producer Andrew Willis noted how important it is for workers to fight back against the injustices facing the games industry at the moment.\n\"The wall-to-wall organizing effort at id Software was much needed; it's incredibly important that developers across the industry unite to push back on all the unilateral workplace changes that are being handed down from industry executives,\" Willis said.",

    "fullText": "A two-day undercover sting targeting men trying to buy sex in North Texas resulted in 20 arrests at a Fort Worth hotel in November.\n\nAll arrested face felony charges of solicitation of prostitution, which carries a possible sentence of up to two years in prison for a first offense.\n\nThe Tarrant County Sheriff's Office emphasized the high local demand for commercial sex, noting that the majority of victims, traffickers, and buyers are local residents.\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas - A two-day undercover sting in November led to 20 arrests as the Tarrant County Sheriff’s Office targeted people attempting to buy sex in North Texas, authorities said.\n\nFOX 4 reporter, Peyton Yager, was granted rare behind-the-scenes access as members of the sheriff’s human trafficking unit, along with investigators from the Texas Department of Public Safety and Arlington police, conducted operations inside a Fort Worth hotel. The sting focused on men responding to online solicitation ads posted by undercover officers.\n\nInvestigators said the operation began long before officers knocked on hotel room doors. At the sheriff’s administrative building, undercover personnel posing as women posted advertisements offering sex acts for specific prices, a requirement under Texas law to meet the definition of solicitation of prostitution.\n\nOnce a suspect agreed to a sex act and a dollar amount, investigators used the phone number to run background checks and prepare the team positioned at the hotel.\n\n\"We need them to identify what sex act they want and also have the dollar amount exchanged,\" said Melinda Clark of the sheriff’s human trafficking unit.\n\nAs the men arrived for their appointments, officers moved in. Some were arrested immediately upon entering the room, while others attempted to flee or resist as officers subdued them. Turner said it is common during operations to communicate with hundreds of potential buyers, even if only a fraction ultimately shows up.\n\nThose arrested included a church sign-language interpreter, men with families and at least one person officers said intended to take a woman to a truck stop to be trafficked. Several suspects also faced drug possession or resisting arrest charges.\n\nAll were booked into the Tarrant County Jail on charges of solicitation of prostitution, which is a felony in Texas and carries a possible sentence of up to two years in prison for a first offense. None of the men has been convicted in the cases stemming from this operation.\n\n\"This is occurring every day,\" said Commander Kevin Turner, who leads the county’s human trafficking team. \"It’s unimaginable how much there is out there.\"\n\n\"It shows how strong the demand for commercial sex is here in North Texas,\" he said.\n\nTurner emphasized that human trafficking does not fit common misconceptions.\n\n\"The majority of our victims, especially when it comes to sex trafficking, were born and raised here locally,\" he said. \"The traffickers are born and raised here locally. Our buyers are born and raised here locally.\"\n\nThe nonprofit DeliverFund provided technology and data support during the sting. \"It gets busy sometimes,\" said DeliverFund’s Alisha Willemssen. \"Keeping track of who is talking to whom\" helps investigators avoid overlap as they pose as multiple online identities.\n\nAdvocates say arrests alone won’t curb the problem.\n\nThe Fort Worth nonprofit, The Net, works with survivors and also with men arrested for solicitation through its MASE (Men Against Sexual Exploitation) program, offering resources in hopes of reducing repeat offenses.\n\n\"We know that just the threat of arrest or jail time alone is not going to keep them from doing this again,\" said Ty Bowden, the organization’s associate director. \"We want to get at the root of what’s bringing them here.\"\n\nThe Tarrant County human trafficking unit, formed in 2021, has conducted several stings in recent years. As large-scale events such as the 2026 World Cup approach, Turner said law enforcement agencies are preparing for increased demand and continuing to refine their response.\n\n\"They really wanted to show how prevalent it is,\" he said, \"and how it happens at hotels near you.\"\n\nInformation in this story was provided by FOX 4's Peyton Yager.",

    "fullText": "LSU football will take the field for the Texas Bowl without three key starters. According to NOLA.com’s Wilson Alexander, cornerback Mansoor Delane, quarterback Garrett Nussmeier and linebacker Whit Weeks will all miss the Tigers’ contest against Houston due to injuries.\n\nNussmeier missing this outing shouldn’t come as a big surprise. He missed the last three games of LSU’s season due to a core injury that had been bothering him since fall camp. Since he’s likely preparing for the NFL Draft and the Tigers want to see more of sophomore quarterback Michael Van Buren, it wasn’t expected that he would play.\n\nWeeks’ absence also isn’t much of a shock. He broke his ankle during LSU’s game against Ole Miss, and despite retaking the field for the Tigers’ final two games of the season, he probably needs to focus on rehabbing for either his senior season with the Tigers or the NFL draft.\n\nThe same goes for Delane, who played through a core injury for most of the season and is expected to be a first-round pick in the upcoming 2026 NFL draft.\n\nLSU has already gotten a good look at the depth behind Weeks and Nussmeier due to their missed time, but Delane being out will give Tigers fans an early look at the young cornerback duo of D.J. Pickett and P.J. Woodland, the latter of whom spent more time in the slot during the games when Delane was healthy.\n\nLSU will face the Houston Cougars on December 27th at 8:15 CT.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: LSU football rules out three starters for bowl game vs Houston",

    "fullText": "Quarterback recruiting in the 2026 cycle was a breeze for Arizona State. It identified El Paso (Texas) Del Valle four-star quarterback Jake Fette as a top target and landed his commitment in September of 2024.\n\nThe Rivals top-100 prospect saw his stock soar heading into his senior season and that led to other high-profile programs checking in. Fette stayed solid with the Sun Devils, though, signing with the Big 12 program last week. He’s the No. 7 QB in the Rivals300.\n\nWith National Signing Day for the 2026 cycle now in the past, many are now getting a feel for the 2027 board. When looking at junior QBs, though, many are already committed. Of the top 25 signal-callers in the cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, 14 are pledged.\n\nAccording to the Rivals Recruiting Prediction Machine, Arizona State is trending for one of the top uncommitted 2027 QBs in the nation. Once again, he resides in the Lone Star State.\n\nBastrop (Texas) four-star QB Weston Nielsen told Rivals’ Sam Spiegelman at the end of September that no program was recruiting him harder than ASU. Now, Spiegelman has been joined by Rivals’ Steve Wiltfong, who logged a pick this month in favor of the Sun Devils landing Nielsen’s commitment.\n\nThe 6-foot-1, 175-pounder will announce his commitment this Saturday, Dec. 13. Arrows continue to point toward Tempe and Kenny Dillingham.\n\n“They still sit pretty high on my board after another visit,” Nielsen told Spiegelman this fall. “They are recruiting me the hardest. They were able to tell me about their program and why they are a good place to be. I definitely felt more connected with them when I left.”\n\nNielsen eclipsed 3,000 passing yards for the second season in a row this fall. Bastrop went 10-3 and the blue-chipper threw 44 touchdowns to just six interceptions. He also rushed for five scores and now has over 100 total TDs to his name at the high school level.\n\nNielsen is the No. 269 overall prospect and No. 20 QB in the 2027 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all major recruiting media companies. He’s also the No. 42 player in Texas.\n\nThe Sun Devils opened their 2027 class earlier this month by landing a pledge from Chino Hills (Calif.) Orange Lutheran four-star wide receiver Nico Bland. He checks in as the No. 188 recruit and No. 23 WR in the nation.\n\nAlong with Fette, ASU signed 18 other prospects and compiled the No. 35 class in the nation, according to the Rivals Industry Team Recruiting Rankings. The class can be seen here.",

    "description": "The suburb was ranked No. 1 for its safety and No. 2 for its booming economy. Round Rock, Georgetown, New Braunfels and Temple also made the list.",
    "fullText": "A recent statewide ranking named the Austin-area suburb Leander as the No. 5 best city in Texas to move to for 2025, and other Austin neighbors made the list as well.\n\nThe analysis, conducted by a customer review and news platform called ConsumerAffairs, evaluated the 50 most populated Texas cities across five categories: affordability, safety, economy, health care and education, in addition to overall quality of life, to determine which cities were best to move to. Each city earned a score out of 100 possible points.\n\nLeander stood out, the analysis said, for its safety ranking — No. 1 statewide — and it also secured the No. 2 spot for its booming economy.\n\nHowever, the city’s rankings were more modest in other areas. The report ranked Leader No. 12 for health care and education, No. 32 for affordability and No. 40 for quality of life.\n\n“Leander’s origin dates back to the 1880s, when a rail line was constructed to connect Austin to Abilene,” the report said. “Nowhere among Texas’ largest cities is violent crime less common, and over the past five years, no metro area has experienced faster job growth.”\n\nThe suburb, which has a population of around 78,000, was also ranked as one of the top ten places to live by U.S. News and World Reports for 2025-2026.\n\nThe top four cities on the ConsumerAffairs list were all in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, followed by Leander and then Round Rock at No. 9.",

    "description": "The U.S.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court in a free speech case on Monday opted not to hear an appeal by a group of residents of a rural Texas county of a judicial decision allowing local officials to remove ​17 books that these officials deemed objectionable from public libraries.\n\nThe justices let stand a lower court's decision allowing the removal of books ‌including ones dealing with themes of race and LGBT identity, from its public library system. The lower court rejected the argument made by the plaintiffs that removing the books was ‌unlawful under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protections against government abridgment of free speech.\n\nThe decision by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals applies to the states of Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi but does not set a nationwide legal precedent.\n\nThere has been a surge in book banning in public schools and public libraries in recent years in many locations around the United States, driven by conservative groups and new state laws limiting what kinds of books children ⁠can access.\n\nLlano County is a rural area about 80 ‌miles (130 km) from the Texas state capital Austin. The dispute began in 2021 when one faction of local residents asked the Llano County library commissioner to remove the disputed books, which covered topics including transgender issues, race and slavery ‍in the United States, puberty and bodily functions like flatulence.\n\nThe 17 works at issue include the 1970 book \"In the Night Kitchen\" by acclaimed author Maurice Sendak due to the depiction of its main character, a boy named Mickey, as nude in some of its illustrations as he visits a surreal kitchen in a dream.\n\nThe library commission ​ordered librarians to comply with the demands, and residents who pushed for the book removals were appointed to a local county board.\n\nA different group ‌of county residents sued to challenge the book ban, alleging their First Amendment rights had been violated.\n\nAt issue is a First Amendment principle called the right to receive information. The Supreme Court long ago concluded that the First Amendment encompasses a fundamental right to receive information and ideas, as it is necessary for the meaningful exercise of other First Amendment rights such as freedom of religion, expression, speech, assembly and the press.\n\nA federal judge in 2023 ordered county officials to restore the disputed books to the library system. But the 5th Circuit in a 10-7 decision reversed the judge's ruling and sided ⁠with the county. The 5th Circuit concluded that public library patrons have no right ​to receive information under the First Amendment.\n\nWriting for the 5th Circuit, Judge Stuart Kyle Duncan ​asserted that \"no one is banning\" books by removing them from libraries.\n\n\"If a disappointed patron can't find a book in the library, he can order it online, buy it from a bookstore or borrow it from a friend,\" wrote Duncan, a ‍judicial appointee of Republican President Donald Trump. \"All ⁠Llano County has done here is what libraries have been doing for two centuries: decide which books they want in their collections.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in a 1982 case that school boards may not remove books because they dislike the ideas contained in those titles. The ⁠justices splintered in their reasoning at that time, leaving the scope of the First Amendment right to receive information unclear.\n\nIn another case, the Supreme Court in June ruled in favor ‌of Christian and Muslim parents in Maryland who sued to keep their elementary school children out of certain classes when ‌storybooks with LGBT characters are read.",

Ron DeSantis on Monday designated one of the largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy groups in the U.S. a “foreign terrorist organization,” following a similar step by Texas last month.\n\nThe directive against the Council on American-Islamic Relations comes in an executive order DeSantis posted on the social media site X. It also gives the same label to the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nNeither CAIR nor the Muslim Brotherhood is designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. government.\n\nThe order instructs Florida agencies to prevent the two groups and those who have provided them material support from receiving contracts, employment and funds from a state executive or cabinet agency.\n\nIn an emailed statement, CAIR and its Florida chapter said the organization plans to sue DeSantis in response to what it called an “unconstitutional” and “defamatory” proclamation.\n\nFounded in 1994, CAIR has 25 chapters around the country.\n\nCAIR last month asked a federal judge to strike down Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's proclamation, saying in a lawsuit that it was “not only contrary to the United States Constitution, but finds no support in any Texas law.”\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood was established in Egypt nearly a century ago and has branches around the world. Its leaders say it renounced violence decades ago and seeks to set up Islamic rule through elections and other peaceful means.

    "fullText": "AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear an appeal on a Texas free speech case that allowed local officials to remove books deemed objectionable from public libraries.\n\nThe case stemmed from a 2022 lawsuit by a group of residents in rural Llano County over the removal from the public library of more than a dozen books dealing with sex, race and gender themes, as well as humorously touching on topics such as flatulence.\n\nA lower federal appeals court had ruled that removing the books did not violate Constitutional free speech protections.\n\nThe case had been closely watched by publishers and librarians across the country. The Supreme Court's decision to not consider the case was criticized by free speech rights groups.\n\nThe Texas case has already been used to ban books in other areas of the country, said Elly Brinkley, staff attorney for U.S. Free Expression Programs at PEN America.\n\n“Leaving the Fifth Circuit’s ruling in place erodes the most elemental principles of free speech and allows state and local governments to exert ideological control over the people with impunity. The government has no place telling people what they can and cannot read,\" Brinkley said.\n\nSam Helmick, president of the American Library Association, said the Supreme Court's decision not to consider the case \"threatens to transform government libraries into centers for indoctrination instead of protecting them as centers of open inquiry, undermining the First Amendment right to read unfettered by viewpoint-based censorship.”\n\nThe Texas case began when a group of residents asked the county library commission to remove the group of books from circulation. The local commission ordered librarians to comply and a separate group of residents sued to keep the books on the shelves.\n\nLlano County, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) northwest of the Texas capital of Austin, has a population of about 20,000. It is mostly white and conservative, with deep ties to agriculture and deer hunting.\n\nThe book titles originally ordered removed included, “Caste: The Origins of Our Discontent” by Isabel Wilkerson; “They Called Themselves the K.K.K: The Birth of an American Terrorist Group,” by Susan Campbell Bartoletti; “In the Night Kitchen” by Maurice Sendak; “It’s Perfectly Normal: Changing Bodies, Growing Up, Sex and Sexual Health” by Robie H. Harris; and “Being Jazz: My Life as a (Transgender) Teen” by Jazz Jennings.\n\nOther titles include “Larry the Farting Leprechaun” by Jane Bexley and “My Butt is So Noisy!” by Dawn McMillan.\n\nA federal judge ordered the county to restore some of the books in 2023, but that decision was reversed earlier this year by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.\n\nThe county at one point briefly considered closing its public libraries rather than return the books to the shelves after the federal judge's initial order.\n\nIn its order on May 23, the appeals court's majority opinion said the decision to remove a book from the library shelf is not a book ban.\n\n“No one is banning (or burning books). If a disappointed patron can't find a book in the library, he can order it online, buy it from a bookstore or borrow it from a friend,” the appeals court opinion said.\n\nLlano County Judge Ron Cunningham, the ranking official in the county, did not immediately respond to an email to his office seeking comment.\n\nHillel Italie contributed from New York City.",
