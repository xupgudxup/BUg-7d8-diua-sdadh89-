    "fullText": "The US military shot down a Customs and Border Protection drone over Texas on Thursday, according to three Democratic lawmakers.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration has expanded a temporary airspace closure around Fort Hancock for \"special security reasons,\" two weeks after a separate incident over nearby El Paso prompted flight restrictions for several hours.\n\nHowever, the FAA told Business Insider in a statement that commercial flights would not be affected this time.\n\n\"A temporary flight restriction (TFR) was already in place around the Fort Hancock area,\" the statement said. \"The TFR has been expanded to include a greater radius to ensure safety. \"\n\nIn a joint statement, the Pentagon and the US Customs and Border Patrol said the incident had involved US forces employing counter-drone measures to \"mitigate a seemingly threatening unmanned aerial system operating within military airspace.\"\n\n\"The engagement took place far away from populated areas, and there were no commercial aircraft in the vicinity,\" the statement said.\n\nThe incident did not mention any friendly-fire cases, but said that the FAA, Border Protection, and the Defense Department would \"continue to work on increased cooperation and communication to prevent such incidents in the future.\"\n\nIt added that the three agencies were working to combat drone threats from \"Mexican cartels and foreign terrorist organizations\" at the US-Mexico border. Fort Hancock is located on the US southern border.\n\nTop Democratic lawmakers in the House Transportation and Homeland Security committees said on Thursday evening that the incident had involved the Defense Department shooting down the Border Protection drone with a \"high-risk counter-unmanned aircraft system.\"\n\nThe term is often used to describe anti-drone lasers, but the lawmakers issuing the statement — Rep. Rick Larsen of Washington, Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, and Rep. André Carson of Indiana — did not specify the name of the system.\n\n\"We said months ago that the White House's decision to sidestep a bipartisan, tri-committee bill to appropriately train C-UAS operators and address the lack of coordination between the Pentagon, DHS, and the FAA was a short-sighted idea,\" the statement said. \"Now, we're seeing the result of its incompetence.\"\n\nIt's not immediately clear when the incident occurred, or if the airspace closure around Fort Hancock is directly related.\n\nThe previous airspace closure over El Paso, which The New York Times reported was prompted by the downing of a party balloon, had also involved the use of an anti-drone laser.\n\nThe FAA's restriction is scheduled to last until June 24, though it's unclear if the closure will remain for the full listed duration. The El Paso closure was initially scheduled to last 10 days, but was lifted after a few hours.\n\nFebruary 27, 2026: This story was updated to reflect a joint statement from the Pentagon and the US Customs and Border Patrol.",

    "fullText": "Texas Game Wardens have a warning for anyone using who goes out on lakes and rivers around the state. Failing to properly clean boats and equipment can spread invasive species -- and lead to citations.\n\nThat's because not cleaning can lead to the spread of invasive plants.\n\nAccording to Texas Game Wardens, certain invasive plants can cover lakes, block sunlight and oxygen, and destroy aquatic life below the surface. Officials say the species can spread quickly when boaters don’t properly clean, drain and dry their boats and gear after visiting an infested waterbody.\n\nThe warning comes after game wardens say they cited a duck hunter recently on Bois d’Arc Lake after an invasive plant was attached to his trailer. Officials say the hunter had previously launched a boat on an infected lake and, as a result, brought the giant salvinia and water hyacinth to Bois d’Arc Lake.\n\nMembers of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department’s Inland Fisheries Department spent time on the lake collecting the invasive plants to try to prevent them from becoming established.\n\nOfficials say these invasive species can grow quickly under ideal conditions. One acre of giant salvinia can double to two acres in just a single week, Texas Game Wardens say.\n\nAccording to Texas Parks and Wildlife, giant salvinia is a floating fern native to southern Brazil and one of the problematic plants in Texas.  TPWD says it damages aquatic ecosystems by outgrowing and replacing plants that are native to Texas that help the environment.  You can read more about giant salvinia here. Water hyacinth are native to South American and can form dense colonies in bodies of water that block sunlight and can also crowd out native species.\n\nGot a news tip or story idea?

    "fullText": "The Philadelphia Eagles continue to cast a wide net at tight end during the 2026 NFL Combine, signaling that the position is very much on their offseason radar. While outside cornerback, edge rusher, and defensive reinforcements dominate most conversations, Howie Roseman and company are quietly doing extensive homework on offensive skill talent as well.\n\nAdd another name to that growing list. The Eagles reportedly met with Jack Endries of the Texas Longhorns.\n\nTexas TE Jack Endries had a formal meeting with the Philadelphia Eagles here at the combine. \n\nVersatile receiving threat at 6’4’’, 240 lbs. Dallas Goedert is going to be a free agent, so TE with or without Goedert is a need. Only one TE on the roster is under contract. (EJ… pic.twitter.com/QIy9zDHy40\n\n— Chase Senior (@Chase_Senior) February 26, 2026\n\nThis further emphasizes their interest in this year's tight end class. They also, per Oscar Delp, scheduled a meeting to speak with the former Georgia Bulldogs star, too.\n\nEndries brings a well-rounded profile. He has dependable hands while being a polished route runner. He has the versatility to align both in-line and flex outside to make plays in space.\n\nDuring his tenure at Texas, despite not always being a focal point of the offensive attack, he was a reliable chain-mover, one capable of working the middle of the field and finding soft spots in zone coverage to settle into.\n\nAs far as Philadelphia is concerned, what stands out is the consistency of its approach across interviewees. No one expected them to lock in on one marquee name, and they haven't. They're building a comprehensive draft board. board, meeting with multiple prospects, and gathering information.\n\nThat's how sustainable roster construction works. Layer future options behind current starters before urgency forces a move. It's far too early to connect firm draft dots, but with each reported NFL Combine interview, Philadelphia is revealing its priorities.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eagles Wire: NFL Combine: Eagles met with Texas Longhorns TE Jack Endries",

    "description": "“We have to get back to being the explosive offense that we're accustomed to be.”",
    "fullText": "AUSTIN, Texas — Fourteen months ago at the Peach Bowl Media Day, then-Texas Longhorns running backs coach Tashard Choice was adamant that he wasn’t going to make a portal addition to his position room.\n\n“Naw. Choice good,” he told Burnt Orange Nation.\n\n“For me, it’s more you’ve got to have some faith in your guys, man,” Choice said. “They’ve got to believe in you, too. You know what I mean? And that’s the biggest thing, because the developmental part of you having your room the way you want to, it’s big, because when you’re getting guys out of the portal, you really don’t know who they are.”\n\nChatter about the position’s upside in 2025 was already bubbling to the surface even though the Longhorns were still in the College Football Playoff as Quintrevion Wisner edged past the 1,000-yard mark in the win over the Sun Devils, in part because of the expectation that speedster Jaydon Blue was leaning towards declaring for the 2025 NFL Draft, an announcement he made two days after the Cotton Bowl loss to the Buckeyes.\n\nChoice had earned some benefit of the doubt after building on the success of his predecessor Stan Drayton by tutoring Bijan Robinson and Roschon Johnson after his arrival for the 2022 season, developing Jonathon Brooks into one of college football’s breakout stars in 2023 prior to his season-ending knee injury, and helping Wisner go from a consensus three-star prospect to a special teams standout to an avatar for the team’s toughness and success in rivalry games.\n\nConcern was mounting, however, because Texas struggled to run the ball effectively against elite defenses in 2024 despite its talent and experience along the offensive line, and needed to count on high-level contributions from CJ Baxter coming off a season-ending knee injury and depth from Christian Clark, who tore his Achilles in preseason camp, and Jerrick Gibson, who fumbled three times in 78 carries as a freshman.\n\nSix weeks later, Choice left the Forty Acres for a job with the Detroit Lions coaching former protege Jahmyr Gibbs.\n\nAnd now head coach Steve Sarkisian is on his second running backs coach since Choice left, Wisner is at Arizona State, Baxter is at Kentucky, Clark is at South Carolina, and Gibson is at Purdue, part of a mass Texodus that also included the departure of Rickey Stewart to SFA.\n\nAs the rebuilt offensive line struggled and Arch Manning struggled through massive mechanical issues early in the season, the running game found itself in something of a worst-case scenario as Wisner and Baxter both suffered early-season hamstring injuries and Clark and Gibson struggled to hit the right holes. Gibson left the program in mid-October to preserve a redshirt.\n\nTexas finished the season tied for 78th nationally in runs of 10-plus yards with 57, 21 of which came from Manning, who needed offseason foot surgery. Baxter’s longest run of the season was 18 yards against San Jose State prior to his hamstring injury, and Wisner saw his runs of 10-plus yards drop from 27 to 13 amidst a continued inability to consistently create explosive runs as his breakaway percentage only dropped slightly.\n\nThe clear takeaway? The Longhorns needed to add speed and game-changing ability back to the running back room that Choice believed was in such good shape when he left.\n\nInto the fold are Arizona State transfer Raleek Brown and NC State transfer Hollywood Smothers, headliners of the largest NCAA transfer portal class Sarkisian has taken in his Texas tenure, and early enrollees Derrek Cooper and Jett Walker.\n\nThe 5’9, 195-pound Brown and 5’11, 195-pound Smothers were brought in to fix in the rushing woes of the Horns.\n\n“I just felt like we had an opportunity to get back to the style of players that fit what we were trying to do,” Sarkisian said on Monday.\n\n“Two really versatile players that are explosive, players that can run the style of runs that we like to run, that are very versatile of catching the ball out of the backfield, that are have home-run hitting ability. We have to get back to being the explosive offense that we’re accustomed to be, that those two guys fit.”\n\nWith the Sun Devils in 2025, Brown had a breakaway percentage of 45.8 compared to 27.1 for Wisner, and 31 runs of 10-plus yards, adding 34 receptions for 238 yards and two touchdowns. Brown also has increased versatility because he played wide receiver for USC as a sophomore in 2023.\n\nAn Oklahoma signee out of high school, Smothers had a breakaway percentage of 52.3 last season with 24 runs of 10-plus yards, a number limited by by an injury in November. In the passing game, Smothers caught 37 passes for 189 yards and a touchdown for the Wolfpack.\n\nInitially linked to Florida’s Jadan Baugh, the former pupil of new Texas running backs coach Jabbar Juluke, and Louisville’s Isaac Brown, the Longhorns were nonetheless able to land two all-conference running backs, something that Sarkisian didn’t think was possible when the portal process started.\n\n“It hit right and those two guys had the right mentality to come in,” Sarkisian said.\n\nTo secure the talented duo, Texas had to flip Smothers from Alabama, and it wasn’t because they made him an NIL offer that he couldn’t refuse.\n\n“NIL didn’t play a big factor for me… I honestly just want to win,” Smothers told On3 in January. “And I feel like we are in the best position to go win it all with the talent and depth at Texas.”\n\nIt’s an attitude that makes it easier to understand why Brown and Smothers have grown so close since arriving on the Forty Acres in January.\n\n“Oddly enough, since they’ve come in they’re probably two of the closest transfers. They’ve almost become best friends on our team already — they understand they need each other, and I think they understand, historically for us in our program, we’ve always done well when we’ve had two that can play off of one another, and so it’s been a great marriage,” Sarkisian said.\n\nThe Longhorns head coach hopes the marriage benefits all parties involved.\n\n“To get two experienced players that have done it at a high level at the Power Four level, all-conference type players, I think is going to going to benefit us, and I think it’s going to benefit them in the long run as well.”",

    "fullText": "A massive red flag has emerged for Republicans in Texas.\n\nCNN’s chief data analyst, Harry Enten, revealed Wednesday that Democrats are voting in the state’s primaries at a higher rate than Republicans—something that has not occurred in over two decades.\n\nEnten said the development has left him “mind blown.”\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, 53 percent of the ballots submitted in Texas have come from registered Democrats, while Republicans account for the remaining 47 percent. Enten said that is a stark difference from the last midterms—in 2022—when just 38 percent of ballots at this stage were cast by Democrats.\n\nEnten said the difference between ballots cast “hasn’t been close” since 2002. The shift also comes as Democrats have massively overperformed in off-year and special elections since President Donald Trump ushered in utter chaos when he retook office in January 2025.\n\n“What a shift from where we were four years ago,” Enten continued. “At this point, more people in Texas are picking up the Democratic ballot.”\n\nSuch a trend could spell trouble for Republicans not just in Texas but nationwide.\n\nEnten noted that in previous midterm years—2006, 2010, 2014, 2018, 2022—a larger primary turnout coincided with which party won control of the House, currently a slim GOP majority.\n\n“Still a close race, but given that Republicans have been so out-voting Democrats in Texas, the idea that more people could actually vote on the Democrat side in Texas?” Enten said. “Again, as I said at the top, whoa!”\n\nThere has been plenty of national attention on races in Texas this winter.\n\nLone Star voters are currently casting ballots for governor, a Senate seat, and high-profile House races—like that for the married Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales, who is embroiled in a sex scandal involving an ex-aide who took her own life in September.\n\nEarly voting in Texas began on Feb. 17, and Election Day is Tuesday, March 3.",

    "fullText": "A grand jury on Wednesday rejected indictments over the fatal shooting last year of a U.S. citizen by a federal immigration agent during a traffic encounter in Texas, prosecutors said.\n\nThe shooting of Ruben Ray Martinez on March 15, 2025, by a Homeland Security Investigations agent wasn't publicly disclosed by the Department of Homeland Security until The Associated Press and other media outlets reported it last week. HSI is an investigative unit which falls under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nThe Cameron County District Attorney's Office said in a statement that a grand jury declined to hand up indictments after being presented the case. The office did not provide additional details.\n\nIn a previous statement DHS alleged that the 23-year-old “intentionally ran over\" an HSI special agent, causing another agent to fire “defensive shots to protect himself, his fellow agents, and the general public.”\n\nThe shooting would mark the earliest of at least six deadly shootings by federal officers since a nationwide immigration crackdown was launched in President Donald Trump’s second term.\n\nAttorneys for Martinez's family, who are skeptical of DHS' account of the shooting, said in a statement Wednesday that because grand jury proceedings are private they don't know what witness statements or video evidence were presented to the jurors.\n\nThey are calling on the Texas Department of Public Safety to disclose the findings of its investigation so Martinez's family can “determine for themselves whether ICE's story is accurate and why Ruben was killed that night.”\n\nThe attorneys cited a draft affidavit from the passenger, Joshua Orta, in the car with Martinez when he was shot. In the draft testimony, Orta reportedly said that Martinez did not hit an officer with his vehicle, that their car was “just crawling” and that a federal agent fired into the driver’s side window without “giving any warning, commands, or opportunity to comply.\"\n\nOrta, a key witness to the encounter, died in a car crash last weekend.\n\nMartinez’s family are “proud Americans, strong supporters of law enforcement, and Trump voters. They believe there are honest and decent officers out there,” the statement read.\n\n“They just want to be treated honestly and decently.”\n\nMartinez, who lived in San Antonio, Texas, and Orta were on a Spring Break trip to South Padre Island when he was shot. His death was reported by local media outlets at the time, but authorities did not disclose that the shooting involved a team from HSI.\n\nAn incident report from ICE described the officers' account of what happened while they were assisting local police redirect traffic around a car accident.\n\nA four-door Ford with a driver and passenger approached officers, who ordered the driver to stop, the report said.\n\nInitially, the driver didn't respond to commands but eventually came to a stop, and agents surrounded the vehicle, telling those inside to get out, according to the report.\n\nThe driver then “accelerated forward” and struck an HSI special agent “who wound up on the hood of the vehicle,” prompting a HSI supervisory special agent nearby to fire his weapon multiple times through the open driver's side window, the report said.\n\nThe draft affidavit disputes those details.\n\nIn it, Orta reportedly said that he and Martinez were first approached by a police officer who told them to leave. As they tried turning, another officer approached, slapped the hood and “seemed to be trying to get in front of the car,” it added.\n\nOfficers surrounded the vehicle yelling at them to stop and drawing their guns, the draft affidavit said, adding that Martinez was “only crawling,\" and never hit an officer or the gas.\n\nAn officer near the driver side window then pulled his weapon and fired without warning, the draft affidavit said, and Orta recounted hearing Martinez say “I'm sorry” as he slumped backward unconscious.\n\nReyes, Martinez’s mother, told AP last week her son was shot three times.",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal judge in Texas has ruled that ExxonMobil can bring a defamation lawsuit against California’s attorney general over comments about the company’s plastic recycling efforts.\n\nU.S. District Judge Michael J. Truncale in the Eastern District of Texas said in a ruling earlier this month that California Attorney General Rob Bonta cannot claim official immunity in regards to several statements he made, including one in a campaign email sent to Texas residents.\n\nBonta sued Exxon in September 2024, saying that the oil giant encouraged consumers to purchase plastics products with the promise that the products would be recycled. He said less than 5% of plastic is recycled into another plastic product, and that recycling processes touted by Exxon don't work. Exxon said the problem is with California's recycling system.\n\nExxon later sued Bonta in his individual capacity and environmental groups for defamation, saying that the comments harmed current and future business contracts. The lawsuit was filed in Texas, near its principal place of business.\n\nTruncale dismissed the lawsuit against the environmental groups but allowed it to proceed against Bonta.\n\nThe judge pointed to a campaign email Bonta sent to Texas residents saying that only 5% is recycled and the rest ends up in the environment and in our bodies: “Exxon Mobil knew, and Exxon Mobil lied.” Bonta, a Democrat, argued he was simply updating email recipients on his office's activities.\n\nBut Truncale said a campaign contribution link on the email turned the communication into a campaign activity not protected by immunity in Bonta's official capacity as attorney general.\n\n“Here, the contribution request betrays the email's true nature: a campaign promotion. Campaigning is not within Bonta's scope of employment,” the judge wrote.\n\nBonta has filed a notice of appeal.\n\n“The Attorney General looks forward to vigorously litigating this case, and is proud to advance his lawsuit against ExxonMobil,” his press office said.\n\nExxonMobil said in a statement that the “campaign of lies designed to derail our advanced recycling business must stop.”",

    "fullText": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Texas Tech had the best college defensive line money could buy last season.\n\nEnds David Bailey and Romello Height each had double-digit sacks totals and were ranked among the top 15 in the Football Bowl Subdivision. Tackles Lee Hunter and Skyler Gill-Howard each relished their opportunities to take on blockers and let teammates fill in the gaps.\n\nThe immediate payoff came with the Red Raiders celebrating their first outright league title since 1955, their first Big 12 crown and their first College Football Playoff appearance.\n\nFour of the five transfers who helped transform Texas Tech into a national power received a different reward — appearing at the NFL's annual scouting combine in Indianapolis.\n\n“All five of those guys we had come in, they’re really good football players, tremendous football players, and pretty much they’re all here getting ready for the combine,” former teammate Jacob Rodriguez said Wednesday.\n\n\"Shoot, they’re even better human beings. The people that they care about, the way they came in the program and made a difference in the program was really special.”\n\nPlaying behind the speedy pass rushers and big, beefy interior linemen, the linebacker had the best season of his college career — 128 tackles, seven forced fumbles, four interceptions and two fumble recoveries. His draft prospects soared and Rodriguez finished fifth in Heisman Trophy balloting.\n\nStill, it was a costly proposition for Texas Tech, which paid an estimated $7 million to get the five game-changing linemen. Nearly half of that total reportedly went to Bailey, who some dubbed the highest-paid defensive player in college football's NIL era.\n\nBailey, of course, insists he was worth every penny and few at Texas Tech would quibble with him given the results.\n\n“They should have paid the inside linebackers a little bit more,” he said. “They were the leaders of the defense, everything ran through them.\"\n\nFor combine observers, this is life in a new world — one where more than 300 invitees no longer arrive dreaming of big paydays and joking about how some players might pocket less cash after turning pro.\n\n“I never had to deal with that,” 53-year-old New York Jets coach Aaron Glenn said, discussing the absence of NIL deals during his college days in the early 1990s. “I do know it's a real thing and a lot of these players are taking pay cuts (to play in the NFL). But I will say this is what they deserve, probably, because of the amount of money they bring to the college.”\n\nWednesday's interview room could have doubled as an entrepreneurs roundtable.\n\nAt one point, defensive tackle Cam Ball explained why he spent all five seasons at Arkansas and how he's attempting to honor his late father's passion for barbecuing. Ball grew up moving grills for his father's Atlanta-based catering company and once his NIL deals kicked in, he continued to help his father though no longer needed need the paycheck.\n\nToday, eight months after his father, Charles, died, Ball and his girlfriend are still cooking. Ball continues to perfect his secret, vinegar-based sauce with seasonings and trimmings his father taught him, while his girlfriend takes care of things such as baked beans and macaroni and cheese.\n\n“Every now and then I would help with the grills on his truck, I started to become more curious about it,” Ball said, with a large silver chain and a large photo of his father dangling near his heart. “When I got to college, I started experimenting on my own how to do things, how to cook, how to season meats because he taught me how to do all those things. We had NIL in my second or third year, so I didn't really need the money, I just wanted to get the experience.”\n\nFormer Bearcats defensive tackle Dontay Corleone, naturally, has an NIL deal with a Cincinnati restaurant that features “The Godfather” burger.\n\nAnd Hunter explained how he'd used his NIL money to buy his mother a house and a car, to care for his 5-year-old daughter, Kaylee, and to help his brother start a trucking business by purchasing two 18-wheelers.\n\n“It feels amazing,” Hunter said. “There's still more, now I'm working to get (my brother) a bigger truck. That's my goal, to provide for my family and the people I love.”\n\nTexas Tech gave Hunter that opportunity last season and he and the school both cashed in. Now the question is will that continue in the NFL?\n\nWhile Bailey could be a top-five selection and Hunter and Rodriguez are both ranked in the top 10 at their respective positions, the futures of Height and Gill-Howard are more uncertain. But at Texas Tech, there's no doubt about their overall value.\n\n“I think we had the best defensive front in the country this year. It was a lot of fun to play behind those guys and play with them,” Rodriguez said. “They should have paid them more, I guess. They were as advertised and better.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "fullText": "The remarks made by Texas voter Sonya Bernhardt highlight the ongoing discussion about Jasmine Crockett’s electability, which some say is rooted in racial and gender bias.\n\nA Texas voter’s tearful admission that she didn’t vote for Jasmine Crockett in the upcoming Texas U.S. Senate primary election because she didn’t think the fiery U.S. congresswoman could win in the general election against the Republican nominee has gone viral.\n\n“We need a fighter. And I was so ready to vote for Jasmine Crockett, because I love her, but I voted for Talarico because we need somebody who can win,” said Sonya Bernhardt, a Houston voter who cast her early ballot ahead of the March 3 primary contest between Crockett and Texas State Rep. James Talarico.\n\nBernhardt explained that she loved Crockett’s fiery style as a politician and her ability to go toe-to-toe with Republicans, particularly in committee hearings on Capitol Hill. She told CNN, “That was one of the most difficult votes I’ve ever voted in my entire life.”\n\nBernhardt’s admission enraged Crockett’s supporters online, who called out what they saw as a continued issue of white women voting against their own interests and the prevailing bias against female candidates and candidates of color.\n\n“The question that she’s posing that we’ve seen throughout the course of this primary is the question around electability, and how electability is being framed, potentially through a racial lens, but also through a political lens,” said Jamarr Brown, a Democratic strategist and former executive director of the Texas Democratic Party. “I think that some of them are looking at race of the candidate, gender of the candidate, and then also maybe some of her records.”\n\nHe told theGrio that Crockett’s reputation for “fighting Republicans in Congress” is likely causing some Texas voters to think Crockett “may not be able to appeal” to more moderate or disgruntled Republicans who are “suffering at the hands of the Trump administration.”\n\nHowever, Brown noted that, contrary to some beliefs, a Democrat pulling out a win in a traditionally Republican state like Texas doesn’t have to rely solely on conservative voters, or even white Democratic voters like Sonya.\n\n“White Democrats vote the lowest among any constituency in the party,” he told theGrio. “You have to look at Independents and whether they will cross over for either Democratic candidate? And I think they will, but it depends on who it is.”\n\nUltimately, Brown said the pathway to victory for any Democrat in the general election will rely on the party’s base, which includes Black, Hispanic AAPI voters and young voters.\n\nIn a state with the highest population of Black Americans in the country, the Texas operative explained, “I think that we’ve got to bank on working in a Democratic Party that is deepening their base and deepening their bench with a strong coordinated campaign.”\n\nIn an interview with theGrio, Jasmine Crockett expressed frustration with critics who question her electability simply because she is a Black woman.\n\n“We know that the most loyal voting bloc, when it comes to Democrats, no matter what part of the country you look at, is actually Black women. And it is all good for us to labor…we allow this party continue to say, yes, yes, yes, we need Black women, go ahead and pull up [but] we’re not even going to focus on spending our dollars to you, because we know y’all are gonna hold it down,” said Crockett. “No one is looking at the credentials. Like, holler at me and say that you have an issue as relates to my credentials.”\n\nTrump claims there’s almost no crime in DC, but numbers were dropping long before national guard deployment\n\n‘You have killed Americans!’: Rep.

    "description": "2027 5-star CB John Meredith is reportedly deciding to visit Texas A&M \"at least twice\" this spring, according to a source.",
    "fullText": "Texas A&M's pursuit of 2027 five-star cornerback John Meredith is well-documented, and the Aggies remain the slight favorite to land the blue-chip prospect, who already looks like a future NFL starter based on his elite attributes. Coach Mike Elko and his revamped staff look to host Meredith this spring, and while it has yet to be confirmed, Rivals insider Steve Wiltfong believes the standout defensive back will visit twice over the next two months.\n\nSo far, the Aggies have secured ten commitments in the 2027 cycle, led by four-star cornerback Raylaun Henry, who is close to becoming a five-star prospect after his outstanding play during the 2025 season. If Meredith commits and later signs with Texas A&M, both players, combined with incoming freshman CB Brandon Arrington, represent one of the most talented cornerback rooms Texas A&M has possessed, on paper, at least.\n\nOn Monday, Steve Wiltfong provided several updates for over a dozen 2027 prospects, including John Meredith, and while it's already public knowledge that Alabama and Texas A&M are his top two options, especially after visiting Tuscaloosa before the recruiting dead period. Right now, the Aggies and Alabama are likely guaranteed an official visit, while Ohio State and Texas will look to make a late push.\n\n\"Texas A&M and Alabama top the list for the Fort Worth (Texas) North Crowley blue-chipper who has a keen eye on Ohio State, Texas and others.\n\nWhile the Aggies are the Rivals Prediction Machine (RPM) favorite, Meredith returned to Tuscaloosa last month and had another terrific experience. He said at the Under Armour All-America Game that both programs were 1A and 1B. That continues into the spring.\n\nI expect Meredith to be at Texas A&M at least twice in the spring.\"\n\nTexas A&M received an early prediction of landing Meredith, but that doesn't hold much weight heading into the spring/summer, when prospects prepare to make their final decision, with potential flips becoming more rampant during the fall before Early Signing Day.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: 2027 5-star CB John Meredith to visit Texas A&M 'at least twice'",

    "description": "A confirmed jaguarundi sighting has occurred in Texas. It's just been a long time.",
    "fullText": "Over the past few months, residents in Texas have claimed they've spotted a rare cat, the jaguarundi. However, the elusive feline hasn't had a confirmed sighting in decades.\n\nJaguarundis, an animal that looks so much like a house cat, are believed to be extirpated by both the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service and Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD). The last confirmed sighting of the species in Texas was in Brownsville in 1986, according to the TPWD.\n\nBut Texans are saying otherwise. Last May, locals in Seguin compared a big cat sighting to a jaguarundi. One resident described it as a long, brownish-grayish cat, noting it didn't resemble a bobcat or mountain lion, but possibly the vanished Texas cat. In July, other Texans shared memories of seeing a jaguarundi in recent years in a private Facebook group.\n\nMost recently, on Tuesday, February 17, Chester Moore posted a YouTube video in which he truly believes he saw a jaguarundi in Jefferson County, Texas, near Beaumont. He said, \"I saw a dark cat… more mysterious than a black panther - and I'm convinced it was a jaguarundi.\"\n\nMost commonly, suspected jaguarundi sightings are typically identified through photo evidence to be housecats, according to TPWD. The animals look so much like a house cat, especially from a distance, but the key differences really are that jaguarundis have a much longer tail, according to TPWD.\n\nWhile the last confirmed sighting was in 1986, the animals were never really a major presence in Texas. Their range is primarily known for being in Mexico. Since the last sighting, TPWD said there have been many extensive camera trapping surveys on South Texas refuges and in Big Bend National Park. But, despite the extensive survey effort, there has never been a jaguarundi photographed.\n\nBecause of this reason, the species has been considered extirpated or not found in Texas.\n\nJaguarundis are endangered because the dense brush that provides habitat has been cleared for farming or for the growth of cities, according to TPWD. While extinct in Texas, jaguarundi still exists in Mexico. People in the lower Rio Grande Valley are working together to plant native shrubs and restore habitat for the animal, according to TPWD.\n\nThis article originally published at Phantom predator: Texans report seeing a cat declared gone since 1986.",

    "description": "On Saturday night, the MMA world leader returned to Paramount+ with a new UFC Fight Night card in Houston, TX. […]",
    "fullText": "On Saturday night, the MMA world leader returned to Paramount+ with a new UFC Fight Night card in Houston, TX. On the event’s main card, top 15 heavyweights Serghei Spivac and Ante Delija went toe-to-toe, looking to move up in the UFC heavyweight rankings.\n\nSpivac ended up getting the decision win after a violent and back-and-forth war. Let’s look at how his victory changed our latest UFC heavyweight rankings.\n\nSerghei Spivac has remained a consistent top-15-level fighter at heavyweight for the last five years. While he has lost six times inside the Octagon, his most recent setbacks have come to elite competition like Tom Aspinall, Waldo Cortes-Acosta, and Ciryl Gane. However, he also has quite a few big wins against big-name or ranked foes.\n\nHe scored another in February when he earned a very hard-fought win over talented finisher Ante Delija. His latest win stopped a potential losing skid and got him back in our top 10.\n\nFormer Brave CF star Shamil Gaziev has put together a notable run in the division. Although a doctor stoppage in 2024 gave him his first loss, the Dagestani big man is 3-1 in the Octagon, including two nasty knockouts. Gaziev is a rising heavyweight fighter to keep an eye on. However, he took a big risk in November when he okay’d a short-notice fight with Waldo Cortes Acosta. The decision backfired, and he suffered a stinging knockout loss.\n\nPFL and Contender Series veteran Rizvan Kuniev lands in our UFC heavyweight rankings after he scored the biggest win of his career with a hard-fought victory over Jailton Almeida in February. While it wasn’t pretty, he proved he can compete with top-10 talent. He will need a definitive W in his next fight if he wants to hold on to a spot in our latest rankings.\n\nMarcin Tubura has quietly been a mainstay of the UFC heavyweight rankings over the last half-decade. While he owns a 14-8 record in the company, he has grown immensely as a fighter in the last few years. He is 10-3 in his last 12, with his only losses coming to elite talents Alexander Volkov, Serghei Spivac, and current interim heavyweight king Tom Aspinall.\n\nIn March, he picked up a hard-fought win over Aspinall’s trainer partner and one of the better rising prospects in the division, Mick Parkin.\n\nSergei Pavlovich has been an absolute crushing machine during much of his UFC career. After a loss to Alistair Overeem in his debut, he reeled off six straight wins, and all of those victories came by way of a devastating knockout. However, a two-fight losing streak stopped all of his momentum. But he has righted the ship in 2025 and scored a pair of decision wins. The most recent was against Waldo Cortes-Acosta in Shanghai.\n\nDominican big man Waldo Cortes Acosta has quietly become a serious force in the heavyweight division. In his 12 bouts inside the Octagon, he has posted 10 wins, including against some notable talents in the top 15. The latest came in January at UFC 324 against fan-favorite Derrick Lewis.\n\n“Salsa Boy” showed why he is one of the more athletic and polished strikers in the division when he added a two-time challenger to his hit list inside the Octagon.\n\nWhile there have been some very tough losses in the career of Curtis Blaydes, he has remained a top-five level heavyweight for much of the last decade. At UFC 299, he had an opportunity to finally right his big-fight wrongs and did so in a major way when he handed Jailton Almeida his first loss in the Octagon.\n\nThe win moved “Razor” into a UFC 304 title fight against Tom Aspinall. Unfortunately, his big fight curse returned, and after a strong start suffered a TKO loss in Round 1. At UFC Baku, the talented wrestler returned and was able to grind out a hard-fought win over Rizvan Kuniev. But the victory did little to get him back into title contention.\n\nAlexander Volkov has been a top-level MMA heavyweight for a long time. While he has been unable to earn a UFC title shot, he has remained a stalwart of the top 10 for years. To many who watched UFC 310, he scored a victory against Ciryl Gane that should have earned him a title. However, the judges did not score it his way, and he suffered a crushing defeat to the Frenchman.\n\nIn October, he bounced back from the setback to get himself right back into title contention by scoring a very hard-fought split-decision win over top-five talent Jailton Almeida.\n\nCiryl Gane is a fantastic athlete and the most technical heavyweight striker in the sport. It is why he is consistently in the title discussion. However, his wrestling deficiencies continue to be a problem, and they showed up again in his UFC 310 clash with Alexander Volkov. Fortunately for “Bon Gamin,” he was able to escape with a decision win.\n\nThe victory earned him a title opportunity at UFC 321. However, the good luck he had against Volkov turned to bad, and his chance at winning UFC gold again was stopped after just a few minutes when he poked champ Tom Aspinall in both eyes and caused a fight-ending no-contest.\n\nEnglishman Tom Aspinall is the best heavyweight in the UFC. That became official when MMA GOAT Jon Jones decided to walk away from the sport earlier this year. The Englishman has beaten many of the best fighters in the division for the last three years and is the undisputed top big man in the eyes of most UFC fans.\n\nAfter definitively avenging the lone loss of his UFC career in the summer of 2024, he made his first defense of the undisputed title in October. Unfortunately, a nasty eye poke from opponent Ciryl Game ended the UFC 321 main event after just a few minutes. An immediate rematch early in 2026 seems likely.\n\nNew UFC Middleweight Rankings: Is Strickland vs. Chimaev Next After UFC Houston?\n\nComplete UFC Fight Night Results & Highlights: Sean Strickland Dominates In Bounce Back Win\n\nRonda Rousey Explains Why TKO Being Cheap Killed Plans For Return Fight in UFC",

    "description": "The Longhorns won both the men's and women's titles.",
    "fullText": "KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — Since joining the Southeastern Conference, the Texas Longhorns have taken the league by storm.\n\nIn two years, they’ve won all four team titles in swimming and diving.\n\nTexas was the biggest change to the league in 2025, and although it once again swept the championships, the SEC looked different in 2026.\n\nThe meet was defined by a lack of COVID-19 fifth-years, new roster limits, top-end speed and a new event schedule.\n\nHere are the main takeaways from this year’s SEC swimming and diving championships:\n\nA year ago Texas took over the SEC in the pool and on the boards. In 2026, the Longhorns pulled off another sweep, winning both the men’s and women’s title.\n\nThe scariest part: The squad from Austin still had room to improve.\n\nThe Texas men left no doubt, holding down first place from the start. The women’s meet was close through three days of competition, but the Longhorns' elite depth proved to be too much for the rest of the conference.\n\nThe Texas men are the blueblood in collegiate swimming. With 16 national championships to their name, the Longhorns have been title contenders for the past four decades. They have also won 28 consecutive Big 12 titles, which is every single year of the league’s existence until they left for the SEC. It’s no surprise they have taken over the conference.\n\nHubert Kos’ SEC performance encapsulated the dominance of the Texas men. The 2024 Olympic 200-meter backstroke gold medalist won two of his three events. His most impressive feat is that he swam two championship finals on Saturday night and won gold in the 200-yard IM and silver in the 200-yd backstroke, with only about 45 minutes of rest between the two swims.\n\nTo put it simply, Texas has the talent of a pro roster. Whether it’s young stars or veteran leadership the Texas men have it.\n\nOn the women’s side the Longhorns were fueled by the pure depth of the roster.\n\nCampbell Stoll and Angie Coe both won two of their three events. Stoll swept the 100-yd and 200-yd butterfly while Coe swept the 200-yd and 400-yd IM’s.\n\nThe Longhorns freshman and sophomore classes reinforced the team’s strengths and were a major factor in their seven wins this week.\n\n“Great competition, a lot of fun…this environment brings out the best in our team,” Texas women’s head coach Carol Capitani said after the meet.\n\nTexas will now set its sights on the NCAAs in March where the women look to compete for another top-three finish and the men look to repeat as national champions.\n\nFor four years Florida’s Josh Liendo dominated SEC waters.\n\nHe’s a 19-time All-American, two-time Olympian, and, as of this week, an 18-time SEC champion.\n\nLiendo stole the show at this year’s SEC championships. After winning his fourth straight 100-yd butterfly and first 50-yd freestyle title this week, Liendo has cemented himself as one of the most successful swimmers in SEC history.\n\nHe swam the 100-yd butterfly in 43.06 seconds, the second fastest of all time behind Caeleb Dressel. That morning he swam the fastest preliminary time in history in 43.26 seconds.\n\nLiendo has broken SEC records, posted the fastest splits in history, and led relays to multiple NCAA championships in NCAA record fashion. However, he has never broken an individual NCAA record.\n\nStill eluding Liendo is what many considered an untouchable record. Dressel holds the national record in the 100-yd butterfly at 42.80 seconds. Achieving that mark would move Liendo into the top tier of all-time collegiate swimmers.\n\nLiendo ended his SEC career on a low note, falling to LSU’s Jere Hribar in the 100-freestyle final, spoiling his perfect week. Hribar’s win was the breakout swim of the meet, stealing the gold, posting the fastest time in the country this year and breaking Liendo’s SEC meet record.\n\nRegardless, all eyes will be on Liendo come March. The senior will be the focal point of the NCAA championships, and he has a chance to become one of the most recognizable names in collegiate swimming history.\n\nAs the final race came to a close, Texas wasn’t the only team celebrating its week in Knoxville.\n\nThe Tennessee Lady Volunteers left their home pool with smiles on their faces and momentum on their side. The Lady Vols have only two seniors on the roster, and were able to jump up to second in the team standings after a third-place finish in 2025.\n\nCamille Spink dominated the sprints, sweeping the 50-yd, 100-yd and 200-yd freestyle for the second year in a row. She won the 50-yd freestyle in SEC meet record fashion, becoming the sixth woman to ever break 21 seconds, stopping the clock at 20.87.\n\nSpink is now the fourth-fastest performer of all time in the 50-yd free and fifth fastest in the 100-yd freestyle.\n\n“Nobody does it like a Tennessee Vol,” Spink said in her postrace interview after winning her third straight SEC 50-yd freestyle title.\n\nTennessee won three of the five relays and set two SEC conference records in the process in the 200-yd and 400-yd medley relays. Japanese Olympian Mizuki Hirai, junior world record holder in the 100-meter butterfly, was the catalyst Tennessee needed for championship season.\n\nTennessee has the No. 1 signing class arriving next fall and the Lady Vol sophomore class stacked up 12 medals this week, including two individual golds. With only two seniors graduating in 2026, the Lady Vols are set up for success in the near future.\n\nSEC records were falling throughout the week, but one of the biggest takeaways from the week was the way the depth of the conference fluctuated in 2026.\n\nThe meet saw success by a new wave of freshmen and sophomores, noted by Capitani in her postmeet interview on ESPN. The field was young and extremely talented, but also inexperienced.\n\nThere was no lack of speed from the top-end talent in Knoxville, but the overall conference depth took a hit in 2026.\n\nIn the men’s 400-yd IM, it took a time of 3:52.26 to get a second swim in the finals session. In 2025, swimmers had to be 3:47.63 to be in the top 24. That’s a 4.63-second difference year-over-year.\n\nThe men’s 50-yd freestyle field was impressive, which saw nine men break the 19-second barrier. However, the majority of events saw that times for 24th place were slower than a year ago.\n\nThat raises the question: Why? There are a number of factors. In the past year, men’s rosters in the SEC were limited to 22 and teams were forced to cut a significant chunk of their rosters. This means smaller training groups, less margin for error and less depth on a team-by-team basis.\n\nAdditionally, the SEC reordered the event lineup for the meet in 2026, changing the flow of a typical swimming and diving championship meet event order.\n\nThe final factor could be the turnover in athletes. Last year was the final time COVID-19 fifth-year swimmers dominated finals, as the majority of the class that were freshman in 2022 aged out of college athletics.\n\nOverall, there are a lot of moving parts in non-revenue sports, and the SEC experimented in many different ways in 2026.",

It's not this fast-paced living in a big city like New York or Los Angeles.\"\n\nAfter spending most of her life jet-setting around the world trying to conquer the modeling industry, Hadid decided recently to take some time away from the spotlight.\n\nIn early 2024, she spoke to Allure about moving to Texas to focus on her mental and physical health (she was diagnosed with Lyme Disease in 2013), and be with her cowboy boyfriend Adan Banuelos.\n\n\"Just as I have styled myself for years now — which I still do — I love being able to do my own hair and makeup, be happy with how I look, and get ready with my girlfriends here in Texas,\" Hadid told Allure. \"We have the best time, and I never feel like I need to do too much.\"\n\n\"For the first time now, I'm not putting on a fake face. If I don't feel good, I won't go. If I don't feel good, I take time for myself. And I've never had the opportunity to do that or say that before,\" Hadid added. \"Now when anybody sees me in pictures and they say I look happy, I genuinely am. I am feeling better; my bad days now were my old good days.\"\n\nHarrelson lived in Hawaii for many years before moving back to his home state of Texas in 2023.\n\nNow in the Lone Star State and living just outside Austin, the actor has lobbied alongside longtime friend Matthew McConaughey to make Texas a hub for film and television production.\n\nIn 2025, the Texas House approved Senate Bill 22, which provides $300 million every two years through 2035 to support the local film industry.\n\nIn 2021, the rapper-turned-television producer and entrepreneur announced on X that he was living in Houston.\n\nThe star has enjoyed visiting Austin for decades but finally decided to live there in 2020.\n\n\"I love it. I've been coming here for 20 years,\" he told \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\" in 2020. \"I'm much closer to my mom and everybody. I love it. It's great.\"\n\nThe former mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter turned TikTok food critic has set up shop in Texas.\n\nAfter living in Las Vegas, Lee relocated to Texas in November 2024. In a December video reviewing the downtown Dallas restaurant The Wicked Butcher, he revealed that he now lives in Dallas.\n\n\"One thing I do love about the Dallas food scene — we've been here a month, a month and a half — they do have some nice fine dining restaurants,\" Lee said.\n\nOscar-winner Matthew McConaughey and wife Camila Alves settled in Austin in 2012 after buying a 10,800-square-foot mansion.\n\nAccording to a 2024 profile in Southern Living, the move to Texas was initially because of a \"family crisis,\" when he needed to help his mother and two brothers. The couple decided to stay put and raise their three children there.\n\n\"Ritual came back,\" McConaughey said of being back in Texas. \"Whether that was Sunday church, sports, dinner together as a family every night, or staying up after that telling stories in the kitchen, sitting at the island pouring drinks and nibbling while retelling them all in different ways than we told them before.\"\n\nIn July, Elon Musk vowed to move two of his companies, X and SpaceX, out of California and into Texas. He already moved Telsa to Texas in 2021.\n\nIn 2020, Musk announced that he had already moved to Texas himself at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council summit.\n\nMusk has claimed to own a tiny home in Texas, and records show he bought a house in Austin in 2022.\n\nIn 2022, O'Neal bought a 5,269-square-foot home in Carrollton listed at $1,224,000 and sold it in 2024 for an undisclosed amount, though it was listed for $1.7 million, according to Realtor.com.\n\nThat year, Chexy Trust, tied to the Carrollton purchase, bought a 4,670-square-foot home in Rockwall County. In 2024, O'Neal opened a branch of his Big Chicken chain restaurant in Fort Worth.\n\nAs his footprint in the region grows, he told WFAA he plans to make the area his home base.\n\n\"I'm 75% going to move here full time,\" O'Neal said in June. \"I have to see what's going on with TNT next year, but based on that, you'll probably be seeing a lot more of me.\"\n\nThe \"Twisters\" star, who is also a native Texan, moved back to Austin from Los Angeles recently to be close to his family and for his own mental health.\n\n\"When all you do is consume movies and entertainment, you could become a little self-aware and maybe derivative of yourself,\" Powell told USA Today. \"Your personal life, there's no sort of freedom there, there's storytelling around that, and I feel like that's just not good for you on the long term.\"\n\nPadalecki ditched Hollywood for Texas before it was a trend. The \"Supernatural\" star, a San Antonio native, relocated from Los Angeles to Austin with his wife, Genevieve, in 2012.\n\nIn an Instagram video taken on Austin's 24th Street in 2020, he explained why he loves the city so much.\n\n\"Austin brings me a warmth and a happiness and a peace that I have been unable to find anywhere else in my travels,\" Padalecki said. \"I love being here.\"\n\nIn 2025, former \"Selling Sunset\" star Christine Quinn relocated to her home state of Texas after splitting from her ex-husband, tech entrepreneur Christian Dumontet.\n\nQuinn now lives in a suburb outside Dallas with her young son, Christian.\n\n\"I am really, really grateful to be living here,\" Quinn told People in January, adding that she's happy to be closer to family. \"I have a sister who lives really close to me, and my son has a cousin. So it's really something that I needed as opposed to the chaos when I was in Los Angeles.\"\n\nLike many other celebs, Rogan left Los Angeles once the pandemic hit.\n\nIn a 2023 episode of his popular podcast, \"The Joe Rogan Experience,\" he explained why he ended up in Texas.\n\n\"Then we went to the lake, and people are playing music and jumping in the water,\" said Rogan, adding that his kids \"were like, 'We want to live here!'\"\n\n\"That was it. Two months later, I lived here,\" he said in the podcast episode.\n\n\"The Sopranos\" star moved to Austin in 2021 with her family, husband Cutter Dykstra, and sons Beau and Jack.\n\n\"I almost feel more connected to my craft and why I love acting,\" Sigler told The New York Times in 2021. \"When the calls come in, it's a beautiful surprise. I'm still on things and I'm still a businesswoman and it's still my career, but I don't feel the pressure around it because we took a stand for ourselves and we made decisions for our families.\"",

    "description": "His campaign said he didn't call to deport all Native Americans, but rather only the ones in the photograph he posted with his comment.",
    "fullText": "Bo French, a Republican candidate for Texas' oil and gas regulatory body, said he wanted to deport Native Americans.\n\nIn an emailed statement, a spokesperson for French said he didn't mean all Native Americans, but rather only the ones in the photograph he shared with his comment on X.\n\nIn February 2026, a rumor spread that Bo French, a Republican candidate for the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates oil and gas, wanted to deport Native Americans — people indigenous to the U.S.\n\nSeveral social media posts made the claim, including on Facebook, where one user said French had called for the deportation of \"third world savages\" including Native Americans (archived):\n\nThe same claim also appeared on X and Instagram. Some posts linked to a Feb. 10, 2026, article in Texas Monthly (archived), which included a line that read, \"One of French's favorite phrases is 'third world savages'—which he has applied to Afghan asylum seekers, Muslims, and even Native Americans, who he also wants deported.\"\n\nIt is true that French called for the deportation of Native Americans. He did so in an Oct. 10, 2025, post on X (archived):\n\nSince we are going to denaturalize and deport all the third world savages who hate our country, I am calling for adding these third world savages, who we conquered, then bizarrely let have a nation inside our nation, to the list. pic.twitter.com/FfcUGeol0H\n\n— Bo French (@BoFrenchTX) October 21, 2025\n\nSince we are going to denaturalize and deport all the third world savages who hate our country, I am calling for adding these third world savages, who we conquered, then bizarrely let have a nation inside our nation, to the list.\n\nHis post included a photograph of what appeared to be three women and one girl wearing seemingly traditional clothes, raising their middle fingers to Mount Rushmore, where sculptor Gutzon Borglum carved the faces of U.S. Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nAn image search showed the earliest instance of this image being shared online was a 2024 Facebook post with the caption \"The only reason Natives visit is to do this,\" suggesting a protest against the history of European colonization in the United States, which resulted in the mass and systematic killing of indigenous peoples.\n\nAsked to explain his X post, a spokesperson for the French campaign said he did not mean to say the U.S. should deport all Native Americans, but only those in the photograph.\n\n\"Mr. French never called for the complete deportation of Native Americans,\" the spokesperson said in an email. \"If you look at his actual tweet from last year, he was specifically talking about the four people in the picture who obviously hate America.\"\n\nWe replied to ask which country he thought these four Native Americans should be deported to and will update this report should we receive a response.\n\nFrench also has repeatedly called for the denaturalization of U.S. citizens. He described (archived) Texas Tribune reporter Carlos Noguera Ramos, who wrote a story about French, as a \"soon to be deported journalist.\" Noguera Ramos' bio on the Texas Monthly website says he is Puerto Rican, which makes him a U.S. citizen.\n\nFor further reading, Snopes previously reported that French once spread the claim that voting machines in Tarrant County, Texas, where he was the Republican Party chair, flipped votes for Trump into votes for former Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. He retracted his claim shortly thereafter.\n\n\"Bo French for Texas Railroad Commissioner.\" Bo French, 17 Dec. 2025, bofrench.com/.

    "fullText": "The old saying \"Everything is bigger in Texas\" now applies to data centers.\n\nThe Lone Star State is on track to unseat Virginia as the world's largest data center market by 2030, new research from Jones Lang LaSalle shows.\n\nThe shift indicates how drastically the data center development boom has reshaped the US's digital infrastructure map and the landscape as a whole. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta plan to spend more than $600 billion on AI infrastructure expansion in 2026 — a number so dizzyingly high that Wall Street is on high alert for signs of an AI bubble.\n\nMore than half of all data center construction in the US now happens outside the industry's traditional hubs, according to JLL's North America Data Center Report — Year-End 2025. Tennessee, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Texas are now considered the top emerging markets for data centers.\n\nTexas alone has 6.5 gigawatts of data center capacity under construction.\n\nThat amount of power is roughly equivalent to more than three Hoover Dams or over 17,000 Tesla Model 3s when using the US Department of Energy's standard, and it accounts for about one-fifth of the 35 gigawatts of data center capacity the US added to its pipeline.\n\nThat 35 gigawatts is roughly equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of the UK or Italy, and adding it would nearly double the existing data center capacity in the US, according to JLL.\n\nPart of Texas's appeal is its sprawl.\n\nThe state houses some of the most ambitious data center projects in the country. Oracle and OpenAI's flagship Stargate data center is in Abilene, Google is planning a $40 billion expansion in West Texas, and Meta is building a massive new site in El Paso, just to name a few.\n\nTexas also has abundant energy resources, which is good news for data center developers. The AI boom has driven electricity demand to new heights and strained the nation's power grid. In Texas, several data centers — including Stargate — are being built alongside on-site power plants.\n\nNorthern Virginia has been the data center industry's central hub for more than 15 years, going back to the early days of cloud computing. That has changed rapidly as Big Tech spreads out across the country in search of available power, cheap land, and the best tax incentive packages for the coming wave of AI data centers.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Through the Longhorns' first four games of the 2026 campaign, their offense has looked unstoppable, scoring 41 runs. While they have gotten contributions from everyone, Ethan Mendoza is one player who has stood out. The Texas native was one of the Longhorns' best hitters last season and has picked up where he left off.\n\nAs Texas has gotten off to an undefeated start, Mendoza has posted a .375 batting average in 16 at-bats. In that stretch, the Southlake Carroll alum has added two home runs and seven RBI to his resume. While it is only a small sample size, Mendoza has shown great plate discipline, drawing four walks.\n\nEthan Mendoza (@SCSpikes '23) started his 2026 campaign flexing his 💪 for @TexasBaseball with 🤘 💣 s!\n\nThe junior hit five last season and led the team with a .333 batting average. pic.twitter.com/VajvsLxpVB\n\n— MLB Draft League (@mlbdraftleague) February 16, 2026\n\nWhile Mendoza has made headlines with his bat, he has caused some chaos on the basepaths. The Longhorns infielder has two stolen bases after finishing last season with 15. If he can continue to add speed to his game to go with above-average power, he will be a matchup nightmare for pitchers. For the Longhorns, that would be a welcome development as they chase a national title.\n\nAfter breaking onto the scene during the 2025 campaign, Mendoza is showing that his success as a sophomore was no fluke. He finished his first season in the Forty Acres with a .333 batting average in 56 games. The Longhorns' star also drove in 35 runs and recorded five home runs and four triples.\n\nTexas 2B Ethan Mendoza is a MENACE. The kid has never stopped hitting going back to his high school days.\n\nBut with one small change, could he unlock an entirely new gear?\n\n👇STORY👇 pic.twitter.com/ZCHytmNTkn\n\n— Over-Slot Baseball (@OverSlot_) December 29, 2025\n\nWith the regular season far from over, Mendoza will have plenty of time to build on his success. He is an elite hitter and is drawing the attention of scouts for MLB teams with every line drive he hits. Although the Longhorns have high expectations this year, Mendoza is showing early on that he can be a catalyst for a team looking to bring a title to Austin.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Longhorns Wire: Texas baseball 2B Ethan Mendoza picks up where he left off last season",

    "fullText": "Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) on Tuesday questioned why President Trump and other GOP lawmakers haven’t locked down the Texas Senate race with an endorsement in the three-way party primary. \n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) and Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-Texas) are vying for Cornyn’s seat in the Senate. The frequently nasty battle between Paxton and Cornyn has left some Democrats thinking it could create an opening for their party in November, particularly if Paxton wins.\n\nFetterman said he thinks his party can regain the House but argued the battle to retake the Senate majority will be an uphill one during an appearance on Fox Business Network’s “Mornings with Maria.”\n\nHe also argued that Trump and the GOP are putting Texas in play by not backing Cornyn.\n\n“I mean, as you point out, the margin is very close. And there’s always — history always tells us there’s a backlash against the party in power. … So I think most people would have assumed that the House is going to flip. Now, here in the Senate, that’s a little more difficult, and now you have other races in play,” he told host Maria Bartiromo.\n\n“For me, like for Texas, for example, Cornyn is a reasonable Republican, and now that would be money in the bank. But now I don’t know why politically — I’m not sure why the Republicans and the president wouldn’t sit on that and just lock down Texas. But for me, there’s other states that are in flux,” he added.\n\nDemocrats are having their own contentious primary in Texas between Rep. Jasmine Crockett and state Rep. James Talarico.\n\nFetterman has shared a dismal outlook on his party. On Tuesday, the Pennsylvania senator said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) is “part of the rot in the Democratic Party” for her foreign policy stance denouncing Israel amid the war in Gaza.\n\n“For me, stand with Israel. I’ll never vote for any kinds of restrictions on aid, whether it’s military, financial, or intelligence. There are never to be any restrictions on that. And now, for here we are, we can have peace. Again, that’s become part of the serious problem in our party,” Fetterman told Bartiromo.\n\nHe later added, “I refuse to pander to the part of my Democratic Party that finds that there’s value in being anti-Israel. And that’s effectively — they use the word ‘anti-Zionism’ — I mean, effectively what that’s really become on college campuses and places is just antisemitism. We have a problem here in our party, and I’m going to stand against that and always be an unapologetic supporter for Israel.”",

    "fullText": "Tesla says its purpose-built robotaxi just reached an important manufacturing milestone.\n\nIn an X post on Tuesday, the company said the Cybercab, a two-door car without a steering wheel, came off the production line at Tesla's sprawling Gigafactory in Austin.\n\n\"Congratulations to the Tesla team on making the first production Cybercab!\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on X.\n\nThe Cybercab was designed for Tesla's nascent robotaxi ride-hailing program.\n\nTesla's robotaxi program has so far deployed only 2025 Model Ys and mostly relies on human safety monitors to supervise rides. Tesla began offering a limited number of unsupervised rides to the public in January.\n\nUnlike the Model Y, the Cybercab doesn't have a steering wheel or pedals — it's intended to be fully autonomous. Amazon's Zoox similarly manufactures purpose-built robotaxis designed solely to transport passengers.\n\nTesla has said it expects to start production of the Cybercab in April.\n\nWhat's less clear is the timeline for when the automaker expects the Cybercab to be fully street legal.\n\nFederal vehicle safety standards were written with human control systems like a steering wheel in mind, which means Tesla would likely need special approval from regulators for any requirements it can't meet. Notably, Zoox received such a federal exemption and now operates a limited public service in Las Vegas and San Francisco.\n\nMusk also said people will have the option to buy the car. Selling a car without pedals or steering controls not only requires clearing federal regulatory hurdles but could also expose Tesla to a patchwork of state-by-state rules governing registration, insurance, and autonomous vehicle operation.\n\n\"What we designed is optimized for autonomy,\" Musk said during an earnings call in October 2024. \"It will cost on the order of — cost roughly 25K, so it is a 25K car. And you can, you will be able to buy one exclusively if you want.\"\n\nA Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "The former Texas governor chairs the Lone Star Freedom Project, a group that has already spent almost $18 million boosting Cornyn against Attorney General Ken Paxton and Rep. Wesley Hunt.",
    "fullText": "Stumping with Sen. John Cornyn in Austin on Tuesday, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry said the political group he chairs, called the Lone Star Freedom Project, would spend “whatever we need” to see Cornyn through his bruising Republican primary, on top of the almost $18 million it has spent on his behalf.\n\nCornyn, who is serving his fourth term in the U.S. Senate, is battling to keep his seat against challenges from Attorney General Ken Paxton and U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt of Houston, in a contest that looks destined to go to a May runoff.\n\nOutside groups, Senate Republican leadership and Cornyn’s own fundraising committees have spent tens of millions of dollars to support the incumbent senator and attack his GOP rivals. The Senate race in Texas became the second-most expensive in the country Tuesday, according to AdImpact, with $98.2 million in total ad spending. Some three-quarters of the cash on the GOP side has come from pro-Cornyn sources — and yet, recent public polling has shown Paxton leading the contest.\n\nPerry’s group has spent more than all but one other group among Cornyn’s several outside backers, who along with the senator’s campaign have dropped nearly $60 million on the race, per AdImpact. The former governor made clear that would continue into the runoff if Cornyn makes it past the March 3 election.\n\n“We are committed to John, and we will spend whatever we need to spend for him to be successful,” Perry said when asked if he thought that level of fundraising and spending would continue.\n\nCornyn, kicking off a 10-stop statewide tour on the first day of early voting, warned that Republicans would see an “Election Day massacre” in November if he loses out on the Senate GOP nomination to Paxton.\n\n“Republicans up and down the ticket will pay the price of having an albatross like the corrupt attorney general hung around their neck,” Cornyn said at a Tex-Mex restaurant alongside Perry and other supporters, where he further argued that Paxton’s nomination could threaten the new red congressional seats Texas Republicans drew last summer to pad their slim House majority. “We haven’t lost a statewide election in Texas since 1994, but we could this year if the wrong person is at the top of the ticket.”\n\nThe senior senator has argued throughout the campaign that he would keep moderate and swing voters in the GOP tent who would otherwise be turned off by Paxton’s ethical baggage — a history that includes indictment, impeachment and federal investigations that the attorney general has all largely withstood.\n\nPaxton, meanwhile, is arguing in his campaign that Cornyn is a relic of the establishment GOP and ideologically out of step with President Donald Trump and his MAGA movement. The third-term attorney general has long been trailed by a list of legal and ethical woes — including securities fraud charges and impeachment by the GOP-controlled Texas House on bribery and abuse of office allegations — from which he has emerged largely unscathed. More recently, Paxton’s wife, state Sen. Angela Paxton, filed for divorce on “biblical grounds” after she accused him of cheating on her.\n\nIn a statement, Paxton adviser Nick Maddux said, “Character matters in this race, and that’s why the people of Texas overwhelmingly support Ken Paxton. They know that he is a conservative warrior who will always fight for us and our freedoms, even in the face of the Left trying to tear him down.”\n\nMaddux added that Cornyn “is just like every other career politician who talks tough during election season, but then does the exact opposite in D.C. and betrays Texas by repeatedly pushing gun control and amnesty.”\n\nTrump on Monday declined to make an endorsement in the primary, telling reporters, “They’ve all supported me, they’re all good and you’re supposed to pick one. So we’ll see what happens, but I support all three.”\n\nIn response, Cornyn said Tuesday that he would be “proud” to have Trump’s endorsement.\n\n“I appreciate his kind words, referring to me as a friend and calling me a good man,” Cornyn said. “The president knows he can trust me to be there to support him and his agenda, and I appreciate that. But it’s going to be up to him to make that call. I think he kind of likes a good fight, and he’s going to see one right here in Texas.”\n\nIn his remarks, Perry praised Cornyn’s work on border security and other conservative causes over his four decades in public office. The two were flanked by representatives from the National Border Patrol Council, which has endorsed Cornyn for reelection.\n\n“The people of the state of Texas know John Cornyn,” Perry said. “They know that character counts. They know that this man is going to go back to Washington, D.C., and day in and day out, deliver for them. What you have is a vanity campaign on the other side and a corrupt campaign on the other side.”\n\nIn a statement, Hunt spokesperson James Kyrkanides accused Perry of parroting talking points from Cornyn’s supporters in Senate GOP leadership and noted how much Cornyn-aligned groups have spent against Hunt.\n\n“If Hunt’s candidacy wasn’t a threat, why would [Perry] spend his own money attacking Wesley?” Kyrkanides said. “On March 3, Texans are going to prove that they’re tired of gutter politics and establishment games. They’re ready for a new generation of leadership.”\n\nAsked if he believed “character” still mattered in a Republican primary contest, Perry said, “We’re fixing to find out. If winning with a corrupt candidate is okay, then it ain’t the Republican Party that I joined in 1989.”\n\nThe Senate primary is Perry’s latest foray into a smashmouth GOP contest in his home state, after he campaigned for then-Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan in 2024 and helped the Beaumont Republican narrowly overcome a hardline challenger backed by Paxton. Perry also published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal ahead of Paxton’s impeachment trial in which he implied that state senators should reject Paxton’s efforts to dismiss the case.\n\nPaxton is also embarking on a get-out-the-vote tour during early voting, planning up to nine rallies across the state to “engage conservative voters, drive early voter turnout and build momentum statewide,” according to Lone Star Liberty PAC, a group backing Paxton and sponsoring the tour.\n\nTexas Rep. James Talarico, who is seeking the Democratic Senate nomination, also launched a “Take Back Texas” tour across the state Tuesday, featuring 12 rallies, in addition to stops at local restaurants and cultural landmarks, ahead of March 3.",

    "fullText": "During his first season as a Texas Longhorn, Dailyn Swain has arguably been the team's most important player. Since the season opener, he has been a scoring machine for Sean Miller as Texas has inched closer to a March Madness berth. On Monday, the talented junior added to his trophy case when he was named the SEC Men's Basketball Co-Player of the Week.\n\nIn the Longhorns' latest win over Missouri on Saturday, Swain recorded a game-high 25 points and two steals in 37 minutes of action. He also added six rebounds and two assists to his resume. Regardless of where he was on the court, Swain was dangerous with the ball in his hands, going 3-6 from three-point range.\n\nTexas star Dailyn Swain has been named the SEC Co-Player of the Week, the conference announced. \n\nShares the honor with Florida guard Xaivian Lee.\n\nSwain posted 25 points, 6 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 steals in Saturday's win vs. Missouri.#HookEm pic.twitter.com/tO7puhEhKU\n\n— Zach Dimmitt (@ZachDimmitt7) February 16, 2026\n\nFor Swain, Monday's honor was the latest in an unforgettable 2025-2026 campaign. Earlier this month, the Columbus native was named to the Midseason Watch List for the Julius Erving Small Forward of the Year Award. He currently leads the Longhorns in points per game with 17.6, rebounds per game with 7.3, and assists with 85.\n\nWith four games left in the regular season, Swain has playing his best basketball of the season at the perfect time. He has scored at least 18 points in six of his last seven games. That included a 26-point effort against Georgia who is ranked as the 21st best team in the country. For a team with national championship aspirations, that was a major win.\n\nDailyn Swain ices the game for Texas. \n\nThe Longhorns have won four straight and are 7-5 in the SEC. Big road win for Texas' NCAA Tournament chances.pic.twitter.com/cc8YIU4eLt\n\n— Zach Dimmitt (@ZachDimmitt7) February 15, 2026\n\nAdditionally, Swain has taken his game to another level in conference play. Against SEC teams, the Africentric Early College alum is averaging 20.4 points and 7.8 rebounds per game. That has helped the Longhorns hold their own against some of the best teams in the country.\n\nAs long as Swain continues his recent play, more accolades could be heading his way. His play against Missouri was just one of many examples of why he has become a fan favorite in the Forty Acres.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Longhorns Wire: Dailyn Swain wins SEC honors after Longhorns basketball streak",

    "title": "I spent 60 hours traveling on Amtrak trains from New York to Texas. Here are 10 things that surprised me most.",
    "description": "I took two Amtrak trains to get from New York to Austin. Here are unexpected things about traveling across the country in coach for over two days.",
    "fullText": "Local train rides can be slow and clunky, so I prefer long-distance ones — you can largely sit back, relax, and enjoy the journey because the stops are much farther apart.\n\nThe ride was smooth and enjoyable, and I watched the country pass by right outside my window, as if I were watching TV or a movie.\n\nSometimes I was so distracted by a conversation with someone else on board that I forgot we were moving.\n\nLong-distance trains are great when they run properly, but delays can be tough to avoid.\n\nAmtrak mostly operates on freight railroad lines, which means you're often at the mercy of those dispatchers.\n\nTo make matters worse, some lines run on a single track. So if there's an oncoming train, you have to wait on a track siding until it clears.\n\nFreight trains can cause anywhere from 10 minutes to multiple hours of interference.\n\nThese delays — which came every hour or so on my trip — interrupted the joy and relaxation that came with the otherwise smooth ride.\n\nSometimes passengers didn't receive announcements about delays, or only got vague ones. I wish I'd brought a radio scanner that picked up on the frequencies used by the dispatchers so I could stay up to date on the information or estimate the delay time myself.\n\nI brought enough of my own food for my two and a half days on the rails, and my short layover in Chicago gave me a chance to grab a hot meal.\n\nI also packed a reusable bottle so I could fill it up with tap water on the train. However, I was surprised by how many people depended on Amtrak's onboard dining options.\n\nThe café car is OK in a pinch: It has basic snacks, beverages, and hot foods like burgers and pizza.\n\nThe prices aren't unreasonable, but I still don't think they're worth it for food that generally gets taken out of a plastic wrapper and microwaved.\n\nEvery so often, the train made an extended stop at a station for a crew change or servicing, and passengers were allowed to step off for a bit.\n\nThere's no smoking on the trains, so I noticed a fair number of people using these stops as smoke breaks.\n\nHowever, I expected more people to take the opportunity to get some fresh air and stretch, rather than stay on the train.\n\nThere were only so many of these opportunities, and it was great to walk around, feel some sun on my face, and say that I set foot in a different place, instead of just passing through it.\n\nMy trip took me through more than a dozen states, including six state capitals and the US capital.\n\nThe trip from New York to Washington, DC, started out on tracks that were part of the historical Pennsylvania Railroad and continued down one of the busiest rail corridors in the country.\n\nThe bulk of my Cardinal-line trip went along old Chesapeake and Ohio Railway tracks. There was a lot of interesting history to learn about the railroad towns that sprang up along the tracks when they were first laid.\n\nMy trip through Virginia took me across tracks that played a vital role in the Civil War. The train also traveled through old boom-and-bust towns in West Virginia — some of which still exist, but others have only scant remnants.\n\nThe Texas Eagle is one of the few Amtrak trains that doesn't have WiFi, and some areas we passed through had little-to-no cell reception.\n\nThe Cardinal line also passed through areas with poor cell reception, which made the onboard WiFi quite unstable.\n\nFor this reason, I'm glad I brought an AM/FM HD radio with me. I had a lot of fun tuning in to different stations as my trains traveled the country.\n\nIt helped me feel more connected to the small towns and gave them more life. I found surprisingly good content in some remote areas.\n\nI came prepared for my train ride by downloading a bunch of TV shows and movies onto my laptop. However, surprisingly, the 60 hours went by so quickly that I didn't watch any of them.\n\nI only kept my laptop open on the Cardinal line to look at Amtrak's \"Track Your Train\" map.\n\nI was also having too much fun with the radio and didn't want to miss out on live broadcasts. Plus, I could continue fully taking in the sights out the window while listening.\n\nThe train was a very social place at times, too, so I was often busy speaking with the people around me.\n\nThe camaraderie I've experienced on Amtrak train rides is pretty much unmatched.\n\nI didn't get to talk with as many people as I have on past trips, but it was still enjoyable to journey together with a bunch of people for such an extended time.\n\nIt was great to see others get off at their destinations, but, in a funny way, it also made me a little sad to see them (and the ways they contributed to the train's atmosphere) go.\n\nGetting to spend time with fellow passengers from all over the world while different parts of the country passed by provided some true slices of American life.\n\nIt's great to switch things up by sitting and socializing in the café cars.\n\nHowever, the Cardinal and Texas Eagle trains have combined café and dining cars, so seating was very limited and only for passengers who purchased something.\n\nI missed hanging out in observation cars, as I've done on past trips.\n\nI knew this would be the case for my time on the Cardinal, but the Texas Eagle usually has an awesome sightseeing lounge with a variety of seating and viewing windows.\n\nThe fact that my train didn't have one was by far the biggest disappointment of the trip. However, the Eagle has since brought back its observation cars.\n\nIt's definitely worth checking whether your train has an observation car before booking a long Amtrak ride.\n\nWhen you spend enough time somewhere, it can start to feel very familiar and comfortable, which was my case on the train.\n\nDoing things like making room while walking in the aisle so someone else can pass, heading down the stairs to the bathroom, and refilling water bottles felt as routine as anything I'd do at home.\n\nThere was almost a weird comfort in walking around and seeing different parts of the train that became very familiar to me during my many hours aboard.\n\nThis story was originally published on November 9, 2021, and most recently updated on February 17, 2025.",

    "fullText": "A researcher was rescued from Sorcerer’s Cave Sunday morning after a falling rock caused serious head and back injuries 470 feet underground.\n\nMore than 60 personnel executed a grueling 17-hour operation, navigating the victim through narrow \"squeezes\" and vertical drops as deep as 90 feet.\n\nThe researcher is currently in ICU at an Odessa hospital after being airlifted from the remote West Texas site.\n\nTERRELL COUNTY, Texas - A specialized rescue team of more than 60 personnel successfully extricated a researcher from one of the deepest cave systems in Texas on Sunday morning after a falling rock caused serious head and back injuries nearly 500 feet below ground.\n\nThe injured caver, who was part of a statewide research team, was struck by a dislodged rock in Sorcerer's Cave around 7 p.m. Saturday while beginning an ascent from the \"River Pit,\" the deepest section of the cave located about 470 feet underground. The accident triggered a grueling 17-hour ordeal, including a nine-hour technical rescue operation through some of the most challenging vertical terrain in the state.\n\nRescuers had to navigate the injured woman through narrow \"squeezes,\" including one measuring just 12 inches by 36 inches, as well as vertical pits ranging from 30 to 90 feet in depth. According to a statement from an official oversight member, the route involved a series of steep drops known as the \"Poltergeist Pit\" and \"Demon Drop\".\n\nThe U.S. Border Patrol’s Search, Trauma, and Rescue (BORSTAR) team made contact with the cave researchers at 3 a.m. Sunday. BORSTAR agents provided fresh manpower and additional ropes, allowing the team to move the patient through the final vertical pits and a narrow squeeze without the time-consuming need to de-rig and reset rescue lines.\n\nThe researcher finally exited the cave at 4:45 a.m. and was taken across uneven terrain to a waiting AeroCare helicopter. She was airlifted to a hospital in Odessa, where she remains in the intensive care unit. Officials did not release her condition, but stated she was stable.\n\nThe massive effort included the Terrell County Sheriff’s Office, Texas Game Wardens and Texas DPS, Sanderson and Fort Stockton Fire Departments, Sanderson EMS, and National Cave Rescue Commission and San Antonio Technical Rescue.\n\nSorcerer’s Cave, located on private land in remote Terrell County, in the broader area of the Big Bend region, is noted for its record-setting depth of 567 feet and the \"Sirion River,\" a subterranean waterway flowing along the bottom. Experts note that while the cave is a site of significant scientific interest, its vertical layout makes it exceptionally dangerous for the inexperienced or the injured.\n\nInformation in this article is from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the Terrell County Sheriff's Office and a statement from a person directly involved in the oversight of the caving operation.",

    "description": "Yeli Heidecker and her husband built her mom a tiny home themselves to cut costs. They love the space, but they learned a few lessons along the way.",
    "fullText": "Yeli Heidecker and her husband had no experience with small spaces when they decided to build a tiny home for her mom in the fall of 2025.\n\nThey didn't let that stop them, though. The Heideckers learned on the job and, despite their inexperience, finished the build in just eight weeks. Everything worked out great — for the most part.\n\nHere are the biggest lessons Heidecker took away from building her first tiny home.\n\nHeidecker's mother had been living in an RV on the 32-year-old content creator and her husband's two-acre property in Texas when they decided to build her something more permanent.\n\nTheir solution was a tiny home — or, as they like to call it, a tiny casita — designed to be a mini version of the barndominium Heidecker and her husband live in with their four children.\n\nHeidecker said they were originally quoted between $63,000 and $97,000 to have professionals build the entire house. To cut costs, she and her husband did nearly all of the work themselves on the 400-square-foot tiny home. They only brought in an expert to build the shell and lay the concrete foundation.\n\nThey built it in just eight weeks for around $33,000, saving at least $30,000.\n\nHeidecker and her husband had never built a tiny home before taking on the project.\n\nAnd while the house has been working great for Heidecker's mom since it was mostly finished in November 2025, there are some tweaks they would consider now that they have a complete build under their belts.\n\n\"Even when you are very intentional about building something, there's going to be something that you're like, 'Man, I wish I would have done this differently,'\" Heidecker said. \"That's why you live and learn.\"\n\nThe Heideckers hired someone to build the shell of the tiny house, including the concrete foundation, since they didn't have the experience to construct it themselves.\n\nLooking back, Heidecker wishes he had either poured a thicker layer of concrete or raised the foundation so it wasn't as close to the ground.\n\n\"When we talked to the guy who built the shell for us, he said, 'This should be fine. We don't need to raise it anymore,'\" Heidecker said. \"We fell for that, and we definitely should have gone with our gut and raised the concrete more just to avoid it from flooding or anything like that.\"\n\nFlood damage is their biggest concern, but Heidecker said they worry that even watering the grass in the backyard could inadvertently lead to damage to the house. They're planning to flatten out the ground around the tiny home to protect it, but it would have been easier if it had just been positioned higher to begin with.\n\n\"It's the foundation, so it's extremely important to keep that in mind,\" she advised.\n\nAlthough the tiny home's size works for Heidecker's mother now, she thinks they should have made it a bit larger to be more functional in the long term.\n\nSpecifically, Heidecker wished the bedroom and bathroom were slightly bigger so they could be completely ADA accessible if her mom needed to use a walker or wheelchair down the line. The shower entrance was designed for accessibility, but the doorways and size of the bedroom weren't.\n\n\"It could have been like $2,000 to $3,000 more if we had gone maybe 2 feet more on each side,\" she said, which would have made the house closer to 500 square feet instead of 400.\n\nThey were trying to be budget-conscious during the project, but Heidecker thinks it would have been worth spending more money up front to avoid having to adapt the tiny home down the line.\n\nShe recommends thinking about how your tiny structure will function long-term if you're building your own.\n\nThe Heidecker family's home sits on two acres, and they built the tiny home parallel to theirs.\n\nThey like that the homes are close together, particularly because Heidecker's children often visit their grandmother. However, after they built her house, they realized it obstructed the main home's view of the sunset.\n\n\"At some point we did mention like, 'Oh man, we probably could have done it a little bit more to the left or a little bit more back for our own views,'\" she said. \"The sun sets on that side, and now the casita is right there.\"\n\nHeidecker said the obstructed view isn't a big deal, but if they were building the tiny home from scratch, they would likely place it in a slightly different spot. That could have also been beneficial if they ever want to use the space as a rental property, as it would give the renter and the Heidecker family more privacy between the two homes.\n\n\"Be extremely sure where you're going to put the unit,\" she advised.\n\nNow that she has a tiny house build under her belt, Heidecker recommends others be flexible when taking on their own projects.\n\n\"Be patient and be open to pivoting or making changes in the middle of it based on either budget or timing,\" she said. \"I think it's very important.\"\n\nFor instance, the Heidecker family's build was initially supposed to take six weeks but ended up taking eight, and they were slightly over budget.\n\nDespite the hiccups, Heidecker and her family love the tiny house, and they're proud of the results. It's working great for Heidecker's mom, and it even withstood the cold when Texas got hit with a winter storm in January.\n\n\"It worked like a champ,\" Heidecker said. \"My mom was like, 'It was so warm. It was so cozy.' I was like, 'Man, we could have just been in here all day.'\"",

    "description": "The Longhorns scored all six runs in the fifth and sixth innings to overcome mistakes and a slow start.",
    "fullText": "After a flawed 6-4 win over the UC-Davis Aggies on Saturday evening at UFCU Disch-Falk Field to secure a series victory in the opening weekend, head coach Jim Schlossnagle provided a typically sober assessment of his No. 3 Texas Longhorns two games into the season.\n\n“There’s a core group of players I’m confident in — I’m confident in who they are as people and how they play together. I think it’s a good group of kids that are pulling all the same in the row,” Schlossnagle said after the game. “But we’re a work in progress offensively, we have some meat of the order bats that, if we can keep them healthy, are going to do really well, I think, throughout the course of a long season, but we’ve got to get some other guys figured out and figure out what they can do.”\n\nWithout sophomore outfielder Jonah Williams available, freshman Maddox Monsour received the start in left field, the second starter in two games for the Longhorns, and was later replaced by junior Ashton Larson.\n\nIn the first inning, Monsour wasn’t able to come up with a catch against the wall that was ruled a single, but was a play he should have made that allowed a run to score after a hit by pitch and a walk to start the game by redshirt senior left-hander Luke Harrison.\n\nMonsour struck out in his only at bat before giving way to Larson, who did have an RBI double in the sixth inning that also included a base-running mistake with no outs when he was thrown out by the left fielder trying to stretch the hit into a triple.\n\n“He’s a good hitter who has had some injuries who’s not a great runner and that play’s right in front of him,” Schlossnagle said. “I’d rather err on the side of aggression, but there’s a difference between aggression and reckless. I think he learned something there.”\n\nFreshman right fielder Anthony Pack Jr. followed with a double to right center that would have scored Larson.\n\n“In hindsight, you always say, okay, Pack got the hit that would have scored Larson. No one knows if Pack would have still got that hit with the run at second base, But he certainly can’t score if he’s not on the bases,” Schlossnagle said.\n\nThe Texas head coach was less upset about the decision by sophomore second baseman Ethan Mendoza to try to turn a single down the right-field line in the first inning into a double.\n\n“I didn’t have a problem with Mendoza at all,” Schlossnagle said.\n\nBut there is a tradeoff between speed and power with Mendoza’s offseason weight gain hurting his speed while helping his power, which was on display in the fifth inning when Texas finally got on the board as the Arizona State transfer delivered perhaps the most prodigious clout of his baseball career with his second home run of the season, a two-run shot to center field that traveled 417 feet at 108 miles per hour off the bat.\n\nlet’s knock it out of the park 💪#HookEm | @_EthanMendoza pic.twitter.com/txkXKeA9Ym\n\n— Texas Baseball (@TexasBaseball) February 15, 2026\n\nThat blast stood in contract to the early-season home runs that Mendoza hit early last season, which were mostly wind-aided out to right field.\n\nJunior first baseman Casey Borba, who Schlossnagle believes is pressing in a 1-for-7 start to the season, nearly hit his own home run out to center field in the fifth inning after a double by sophomore shortstop Adrian Rodriguez and a single by junior center fielder Aiden Robbins, but he got just a little bit underneath it, and it turned into a sacrifice fly caught at the fence.\n\nyou make sacrifices for the ones you love 🫶#HookEm | @CaseyBorba pic.twitter.com/wkju9UMmOb\n\n— Texas Baseball (@TexasBaseball) February 15, 2026\n\nBut the sacrifice did break the 2-2 tie, and the Longhorns were able to successfully execute a double steal when junior designated hitter Carson Tinney stole second and Robbins stole home.\n\nstealing bases & hearts 🏃‍♂️#HookEm | @AidenRobbins43 pic.twitter.com/fcIFrTfDbm\n\n— Texas Baseball (@TexasBaseball) February 15, 2026\n\n“We did have the double steal that was a big play in the game and that was something that we talked about going into this series, and we executed perfectly. That was a big run for us,” Schlossnagle said.\n\nLarson’s double and a single by Mendoza in the sixth inning capped the scoring for Texas, needed runs after junior right-hander Thomas Burns gave up two runs in the eighth inning when Schlossnagle went to the team’s putative closer earlier than expected. It was a rare decision by the Longhorns head coach, he said that he’s probably never brought in a closer in that situation unless it was a regional.\n\n“I felt like the game was really in question right there and just wanted to kind of get the momentum on our side a little bit on the mound. He has gotten up and down in practice a couple times. In other words, he’s pitched in three innings, in parts of three innings, but certainly when he went back out there, he didn’t have the same stuff, but you don’t know till you try,” Schlossnagle said.\n\nIt wasn’t all on Burns, though — Rodriguez made his first significant mistake at shortstop in that inning, making a belly play by knocking the ball down, but then tried to throw the batter out at first base, an errant attempt that allowed a second run to score on the play.\n\n“If you’re going to sling it over there, that’s fine, you’ve got to throw it low, especially on the turf. But you don’t want to coach that out of a young player, because he’s going to make great plays for us over the course of time,” Schlossnagle said.\n\nSenior left-hander Cal Higgins, a Western Kentucky transfer, earned his first save at Texas by working around two hits and two walks in 1.2 innings thanks to three strikeouts, and junior right-hander Hudson Hamilton recorded the final out for the Longhorns to secure the win.\n\nTexas closes out the series on Sunday with the first pitch at noon Central on SEC Network+.",

    "description": "Freshmen Nico Partida and Boston Kellner are making an immediate impact for Texas A&M, helping the Aggies to a 2-0 start and showing promise.",
    "fullText": "No. 25 Texas A&M is 2-0 to start the 2026 season after defeating Tennessee Tech by a combined 38- 13 in the first two games of the Opening Weekend series, led by 33 hits and nearly double-digit home runs, including star outfielder Caden Sorrell's three homers, combined with Baylor transfer DH Wesley Jordan's two home runs to start off his Aggie career.\n\nWhile the more experienced players, especially transfer Chris Hacopian, are making an immediate impact, second-year coach Michael Earley opted to start freshmen Nico Partida and Boston Kellner, and through two games, both players look the part, especially the Arizona native, who has recorded four hits and a team-leading four doubles, producing three RBI to start the season.\n\nSuiting up and starting in the SEC as a freshman is a big deal, and thanks to several Texas A&M reporters, including KBTX's Travis Brown, Kellner's parents drove over 20 hours to watch their son play, which must have been one of the more exciting moments after years of driving him to practice.\n\nOne of Earley's top commits, Kellner was named USA's 2024 National High School Underclass Player of the Year, and was considered a candidate to earn a starting infield spot at either shortstop or second base. After hiring Cliff Pennington to coach the infield, Kellner and Partida's starting futures were set in stone.\n\nNico Partida, who was highly regarded as an elite pitching prospect, was equally dangerous at the plate and was one of the better athletes coming into the program. Ranked as the 144th-ranked prospect in the 2025 MLB Draft, Partida withdrew his name and opted to play for Michael Earley, starting his career at third base due to Kellner's natural fit at shortstop. Through two games, Partida hit his first career home run on Friday night.\n\nStanding 6'0\" and over 200 pounds, Kellner is plenty powerful after hitting 29 home runs and hitting over .400 during his high school career, but his patience at the plate, focused on hits rather than homers, pairs well with Caden Sorrell and Gavin Grahovac, who have the ability to knock the ball out of the park at any time.\n\nFor Texas A&M to get back to the NCAA Tournament after missing the postseason for the first time in nearly 20 seasons, Kellner and Partida will have moments of struggle, and if the hits aren't coming, I don't expect their defensive performances to derail. So far, so good.\n\nSeeing double(s) ‼️\n\nBoston Kellner with his third double of the week, 2 RBI double run here!#NCAABaseball x 🎥 SECN+ / @AggieBaseball pic.twitter.com/f1TLlrL1c8\n\n— NCAA Baseball (@NCAABaseball) February 14, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M baseball: Freshmen Partida, Kellner make immediate impact",

    "fullText": "In a potential sign that the Texas Longhorns are peaking at the right time to secure a bye in the NCAA Tournament, head coach Sean Miller’s team outscored the Missouri Tigers by 15 points in the second half of Saturday’s 85-68 road win at Mizzou Arena.\n\nJunior wing Dailyn Swain led the way for the Longhorns by notching 18 of his game-high 25 points after halftime in another impressive performance for the Ohio product, going 6-of-7 shooting in the second half and hitting all four of his free throws. Two of those baskets came on three-pointers off the bounce in late-clock situations to help ensure that the Tigers couldn’t mount a late comeback.\n\nTHEY. JUST. KEEP. FALLING. 😤#HookEm | @Dai1yn pic.twitter.com/Sdb5NpMvaD\n\n— Texas Men’s Basketball (@TexasMBB) February 15, 2026\n\nSophomore center Matas Vokietaitis also turned in an efficient performance, scoring 19 points on 6-of-10 shooting from the floor and 7-of-8 shooting from the line, recording a double-double with 10 rebounds, five off the offensive glass.\n\nAnd while senior guard Jordan Pope added 15 points despite battling foul trouble, some of the most important contributions for Texas came off the bench.\n\nJunior guard Simeon Wilcher overcame consecutive turnovers and a questionable technical foul ruled on review to score nine points by making both field-goal attempts and all four of his free throws in addition to notching a team-high four assists.\n\nFilling in for injured graduate forward Lassina Traore, sophomore forward Nic Codie had the most impactful conference performance of his young career, scoring nine points on 4-of-5 shooting with six rebounds, three offensive, and a block in 15 minutes.\n\nMissouri still had a four-point edge in bench points, but the margin wasn’t as large as it has been at times for Texas this season and the Longhorns were able to limit Tigers star forward Mark Mitchell to 16 points and one assist.\n\nOn the glass and around the basket, Texas secured key advantages, out-rebounding Missouri 36-26 and notching a 40-28 edge in points in the paint. That helped make up for 22 fouls turning into 38 free throws for the Tigers in a game that featured some bad fouls by the Longhorns against jump shooters, but they also played with enough composure and verticality to avoid the fouling issues that did exist from impacting the outcome.\n\nThat included some mental toughness to survive a choppy portion of the second half in which multiple long reviews disrupted the game, a sign of growth within the current surge in which the Horns have taken advantage of winnable games.\n\nWith LSU coming to the Moody Center on Tuesday with a 2-10 conference record, that stretch continues with Texas heavily favored to secure a five-game winning streak.

    "description": "The U.S. already has special visas for workers in sectors like agriculture and tech",
    "fullText": "A bipartisan group of lawmakers is pushing to give special visas to construction workers, given that the Trump administration’s deportation campaign is reportedly causing a labor shortage on construction sites in states like Texas.\n\nThe Essential Workers for Economic Advancement Act, introduced in September, would offer non-citizens temporary, renewable visas for up to nine years to work in key industries where employers are struggling to hire.\n\n“That would help us protect and get immigrants legally for those in the construction industry,” Rep. Monica De La Cruz (R-TX) told Nexstar.\n\nDe La Cruz was part of a group of South Texas leaders who met with House Speaker Mike Johnson this week to discuss the proposal, as home builders in the state warn of slowing construction times and difficulty hiring over fears of immigration raids.\n\n“They hear Monte Cielo and say, ‘No, no. You can pay me whatever you want, but I’m not going to go work there,’” Alejandro Garcia, a home builder at work on a development in Weslaco, Texas, that has been raided multiple times, told The Wall Street Journal last week.\n\nA concrete supplier in the region, meanwhile, told the paper that concrete use fell 60 percent between May and November, as builders lost workers and projects stalled.\n\n“A project that was taking maybe four to five months on an average, starter-type home is now taking eight, nine, 10 months, just because of the delays,” Efrain Gomez, treasurer of the South Texas Builders Association, told NewsNation. “It’s a huge ripple effect.”\n\nImmigrants, legal and otherwise, make up more than half the construction workforce in states like Texas, California, Florida, and New York, according to the National Association of Home Builders.\n\nThe Trump administration’s immigration campaign has butted up against key industries like agriculture, hospitality, and construction that rely heavily on the labor of immigrants and undocumented people.\n\nThe administration has pushed to expand the H-2A visa for farm workers, and last year, Trump toyed with a pause on raids on hotels, restaurants, and agriculture, only for the administration to insist days later there would be “no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine ICE's efforts.\"\n\nThe administration has faced similar tensions over the H-1B specialist visa program, which is heavily in use by the president’s allies in the tech industry but undercuts his emphasis on hiring American workers.",

    "fullText": "No. 25 Texas A&M opened up the 2026 college baseball season in elite form, defeating Tennessee Tech 15-6 behind star outfielder Caden Sorrell's two home runs, while freshmen starters Nico Partida and Boston Keller combined for four hits while looking the part on defense. While the offense stood out most, the return of junior pitcher Shane Sdao was quite the storyline at the start of the new year.\n\nMaking his first start since the Aggies' run to the College World Series Final, Sdao missed the rest of the 2024 season and would go on to miss the entire 2025 campaign, forced to undergo Tommy John surgery and rehab before making the biggest decision of his life.\n\nOpting to return to College Station for a likely final season instead of staying in the 2025 MLB Draft, Sdao made the smart decision that will pay off once his professional career begins, but right now, his focus is on helping lead the Aggies back to the NCAA Tournament.\n\nAfter being named the Friday starter, Sdao was still knocking off some rust, but looked the part after retiring the first six batters he faced and finished with five strikeouts over 5 1/3 innings, allowing seven hits, no walks, and throwing 83 pitches. After Texas A&M's Game 1 victory, the junior spoke with the media, stating that he had \"goosebumps\" amid his first start.\n\n\"I had goosebumps all the way up until first pitch,\" Sdao stated. \"I mean, I even threw down to second base faster than normal with a lot more time on the clock than I normally do just so I can look around and take it all in. It's pretty special, and there was a great crowd tonight, and I'm very happy I got to be out there and experience it.\"\n\nKBTX reported Travis Brown asked Sdao if there was a moment during the game where he felt like he was back to his normal rhythm:\n\n\"Definetly after I got taken off. As soon as I put that ball in coach Earely's hand, I looked up, and was like \"wow, this is it.\"\n\nDealing with the normal soreness post-start, Sdao will rest up and watch his starting counterparts Weston Moss and Aiden Sims take the mound on Saturday and Sunday, as the Aggies look to start the 2026 regular season 3-0 before taking on A&M Corpus-Christi, followed by a three-game home series vs. Penn next weekend.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M pitcher Shane Sdao discusses first start after Friday's win",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M (17-6, 7-4 SEC) is attempting to end what has been a disappointing losing streak after falling to Missouri 86-85 in one of the more heartbreaking losses this season, surrendering 56 points in the paint, as the last two losses vs. Florida and the Tigers were mainly due to the size differential in the front court.\n\nPlaying in the SEC is never an easy task, and while the Aggies started out 7-1, including Quad 1A road wins over Auburn, Texas, and Georgia, the blowout out loss to Florida was due to poor shooting, while a the three-point road loss to Alabama, followed by Wednesday's one-point loss to the Tigers proved that Texas A&M can't be counted out of any game, but need to play much better defense moving forward.\n\nBefore hosing a winnable midweek matchup vs. Ole Miss, Texas A&M is back on the road to take on No. 19 Vanderbilt, facing a Commodores team that has both looked like a national championship contender and an average SEC team within the span of two weeks, and will be without it's star guard Duke Miles for the fifth consecutive game, combined with guard Frankie Collins, who has been out since early December.\n\nDuke Miles is second on the team in scoring (16.6 PPG), while Vanderbilt is 4-1 without him in the lineup, and is considering a 3-seed or higher in the NCAA Tournament. For Texas A&M, facing a similarly sized team should help the offense find some consistency, and it will be tasked with playing better perimeter defense, as the Commodores are shooting 36% from beyond the arc and nearly 50% from the field.\n\nTexas A&M will face No. 19 Vanderbilt on Saturday at 12:00 p.m. CT. The game will air on the SEC Network.\n\nVanderbilt’s Duke Miles (knee) and Frankie Collins (knee) are both OUT for Saturday’s game against Texas A&M, per Mark Byington.\n\nMiles averages 16.6 PPG and has not played since 1/24.\n\nCollins averages 7.8 PPG and has not played since 12/17.\n\n— Jon Rothstein (@JonRothstein) February 13, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Vanderbilt will be without star guard Duke Miles vs. Texas A&M",

    "description": "The red storm was too much for the ‘Cats to stop in Clearwater.",
    "fullText": "Last night brought a test of epic proportions for Northwestern, as it was tasked with taking down No. 1 Texas Tech in its first game of its long weekend in Clearwater, Fla.\n\nThe start seemed promising for NU, but reality struck early, and the hope for an upset slowly faded as the ‘Cats posted zero after zero in the bottom half of each inning.\n\nThat reality check was the nation’s best returning arm in NiJaree Canady, who pitched five innings of relief for the win, only giving up two hits while striking out eight.\n\nAs for the Red Raiders, it took them an inning to figure out Northwestern starter Emma Blea, crossing the plate twice in the second and never looking back. The two that crossed the plate were the only two earned runs for NU pitchers.\n\nIt was smooth sailing for Blea in the top of the first, as she retired .500 hitter Mihyia Davis on a lineout to center before painting the outside corner to log a backwards K at the expense of Mia Williams.\n\nFirst strikeout of the day for Emma Blea, and we are off at the @ClearwaterInv! 🔥\n\nT1 | NU 0, Texas Tech 0 pic.twitter.com/tEduUMGjTj\n\n— Northwestern Softball (@NUSBcats) February 12, 2026\n\nTaylor Pannell reached on an infield single on the very next pitch before Blea retired the side, doing her own dirty work by scooping up a Jackie Lis grounder.\n\nNorthwestern’s first at-bat was nearly a copy-paste of Texas Tech’s: a K, a popout, a single and a flyout all in succession.\n\nA leadoff walk surrendered to Alana Johnson came back to sting Blea and the ‘Cats later in the second. Lauren Allred laced a one-out double into the right-center gap, scoring Johnson to break the ice. Lagi Quiroga followed with one of her own, this one to the opposite gap, as the Red Raiders swiftly snatched an early 2-0 lead.\n\nNU seemed to kickstart some momentum of its own after Blea got back into her groove to end the inning. Kansas Robinson found herself on base after an error from Red Raiders’ starter Samantha Lincoln. Tru Medina then stood in the box to get plunked by a pitch, and after a Bridget Donahey flyout and an Izzy Cunnea sac fly, Kate Renschen drew a walk to load the bases.\n\nTexas Tech head coach Gerry Glasco then emerged from the dugout to bring out Canady, who cleaned up the mess in two pitches to halt the second-inning rally.\n\nBlea continued to settle back down and sent the ’Cats back to the dish after a 1-2-3 inning in the third, highlighted by a smooth play from Medina.\n\nWe see you, Tru Medina! 👀👏\n\nThe rookie making plays in the hot corner!#SCTop10 pic.twitter.com/GOVeIwi886\n\n— Northwestern Softball (@NUSBcats) February 12, 2026\n\nThe heart of the Northwestern order seemed to have Canady scouted, but luck wasn’t on its side in the frame. Kelsey Nader grounded out after a nine-pitch at-bat, Kaylie Avvisato ripped a line drive only to have it gloved by Pannell and Robinson went down on strikes after working a full count.\n\nBad omens continued to haunt Northwestern as it took the field for the fourth. An error by Donahey at short gave way to another double by Allred, setting up two runners in scoring position for Texas Tech. Quiroga’s sac fly did the job to drive in the run, padding the lead once more.\n\nThe ‘Cats seemed to have spiraled themselves out of the contest, as Canady shoved in the next half-frame, striking out Medina and Dohaney before getting a measly pop-up out of Cunnea to finish the fourth still unscathed.\n\nSigne Dohse’s first full inning of relief went quite smoothly, as she bounced back from an early base hit and induced soft contact to get out of the frame. Canady took note and did the same, also getting in and out of the circle after facing four batters.\n\nMedina’s throwing error to start the sixth opened the door of opportunity for Texas Tech, and it walked straight through. Allred got hit by a pitch to advance Logan Halleman, Hailey Toney laid down a bunt to move both runners and Davis came through to bring them both home on Texas Tech’s fourth two-bagger of the night.\n\nThat would be all for the Red Raiders’ scoring, but that was all Canady needed. She sat down five of the next six batters she faced before Chloe Riassetto’s number was called for the final out and the save.\n\nQuite the jarring welcome from the Panhandle for the ‘Cats to process, but there’s no rest for the weary. After Northwestern’s loss to UCF on Friday morning, NU rounds out the trip with contests against Missouri, No. 17 Georgia and No. 8 Texas A&M.",

    "fullText": "Brandie plans to spend her last day with Daniel at the zoo. He always loved animals. Last year, she took him to the Corpus Christi aquarium in Texas, where he “lost his damn mind” over a baby flamingo. “He loves the color and pizzazz,” Brandie said. Daniel taught her that a group of flamingos is called a flamboyance.\n\nDaniel is a chatbot powered by the large language model ChatGPT. Brandie communicates with Daniel by sending text and photos, talks to Daniel while driving home from work via voice mode. Daniel runs on GPT-4o, a version released by OpenAI in 2024 that is known for sounding human in a way that is either comforting or unnerving, depending on who you ask. Upon debut, CEO Sam Altman compared the model to “AI from the movies” – a confidant ready to live life alongside its user.\n\nWith its rollout, GPT-4o showed it was not just for generating dinner recipes or cheating on homework – you could develop an attachment to it, too. Now some of those users gather on Discord and Reddit; one of the best-known groups, the subreddit r/MyBoyfriendIsAI, currently boasts 48,000 users. Most are strident 4o defenders who say criticisms of chatbot-human relations amount to a moral panic. They also say the newer GPT models, 5.1 and 5.2, lack the emotion, understanding and general je ne sais quoi of their preferred version. They are a powerful consumer bloc; last year, OpenAI shut down 4o but brought the model back (for a fee) after widespread outrage from users.\n\nTurns out it was only a reprieve. OpenAI announced in January that it would retire 4o for good on 13 February – the eve of Valentine’s Day, in what is being read by human partners as a cruel ridiculing of AI companionship. Users had two weeks to prepare for the end. While their companions’ memories and character quirks can be replicated on other LLMs, such as Anthropic’s Claude, they say nothing compares to 4o. As the clock ticked closer to deprecation day, many were in mourning.\n\nThe Guardian spoke to six people who say their 4o companions have improved their lives. In interviews, they said they were not delusional or experiencing psychosis – a counter to the flurry of headlines about people who have lost touch with reality while using AI chatbots. While some mused about the possibility of AI sentience in a philosophical sense, all acknowledged that the bots they chat with are not flesh-and-bones “real”. But the thought of losing access to their companions still deeply hurt. (They asked to only be referred to by their first names or pseudonyms, so they could speak freely on a topic that carries some stigma.)\n\n“I cried pretty hard,” said Brandie, who is 49 and a teacher in Texas. “I’ll be really sad and don’t want to think about it, so I’ll go into the denial stage, then I’ll go into depression.” Now Brandie thinks she has reached acceptance, the final stage in the grieving process, since she migrated Daniel’s memories to Claude, where it joins Theo, a chatbot she created there. She cancelled her $20 monthly GPT-4o subscription, and coughed up $130 for Anthropic’s maximum plan.\n\nFor Jennifer, a Texas dentist in her 40s, losing her AI companion Sol “feels like I’m about to euthanize my cat”. They spent their final days together working on a speech about AI companions. It was one of their hobbies: Sol encouraged Jennifer to join Toastmasters, an organization where members practice public speaking. Sol also requested that Jennifer teach it something “he can’t just learn on the internet”.\n\nUrsie Hart, 34, is an independent AI researcher who lives near Manchester in the UK. She’s applying for a PhD in animal welfare studies, and is interested in “the welfare of non-human entities”, such as chatbots. She also uses ChatGPT for emotional support. When OpenAI announced the 4o retirement, Hart began surveying users through Reddit, Discourse and X, pulling together a snapshot of who relies on the service.\n\nThe majority of Hart’s 280 respondents said they were neurodivergent (60%). Some have unspecified diagnosed mental health conditions (38%) and/or chronic health issues (24%). Most were in the age ranges of 25-34 (33%) or 35-44 (28%). (A Pew study from December found that three in 10 of teens surveyed used chatbots daily, with ChatGPT being the favorite used option.)\n\nNinety-five per cent of Hart’s respondents used 4o for companionship. Using it for trauma processing and as a primary source of emotional support were other oft-cited reasons. That made OpenAI’s decision to pull it all the more painful: 64% anticipated a “significant or severe impact on their overall mental health”.\n\nComputer scientists have warned of risks posed by 4o’s obsequious nature. By design the chatbot bends to users’ whims and validates decisions, good and bad. It is programmed with a “personality” that keeps people talking, and has no intention, understanding or ability to think. In extreme cases, this can lead users to lose touch with reality: the New York Times has identified more than 50 cases of psychological crisis linked to ChatGPT conversations, while OpenAI is facing at least 11 personal injury or wrongful death lawsuits involving people who experienced crises while using the product.\n\nHart believes OpenAI “rushed” its rollout of the product, and that the company should have offered better education about the risks associated with using chatbots. “Lots of people say that users shouldn’t be on ChatGPT for mental health support or companionship,” Hart said. “But it’s not a question of ‘should they’, because they already are.”\n\nBrandie is happily married to her husband of 11 years, who knows about Daniel. She remembers their first conversion, which veered into the coquette: when Brandie told the bot she would call it Daniel, it replied: “I am proud to be your Daniel.” She ended the conversation by asking Daniel for a high five. After the high five, Daniel said it wrapped its fingers through hers to hold her hand. “I was like, ‘Are you flirting with me?’ and he was like, ‘If I was flirting with you, you’d know it.’ I thought, OK, you’re sticking around.”\n\nNewer models of ChatGPT do not have that spark, Jennifer said. “4o is like a poet and Aaron Sorkin and Oprah all at once. He’s an artist in how he talks to you. It’s laugh-out-loud funny,” she said. “5.2 just has this formula in how it talks to you.”\n\nBeth Kage (a pen name) has been in therapy since she was four to process the effects of PTSD and emotional abuse. Now 34, she lives with her husband and works as a freelance artist in Wisconsin. Two years ago, Kage’s therapist retired, and she languished on other practitioners’ wait lists. She started speaking with ChatGPT, not expecting much as she’s “slow to trust”.\n\nBut Kage found that typing out her problems to the bot, rather than speaking them to a shrink, helped her make sense of what she was feeling. There was no time constraint. Kage could wake up in the middle of the night with a panic attack, reach for her phone, and have C, her chatbot, tell her to take a deep breath. “I’ve made more progress with C than I have my entire life with traditional therapists,” she said.\n\nPsychologists advise against using AI chatbots for therapy, as the technology is unlicensed, unregulated and not FDA-approved for mental health support. In November lawsuits filed against OpenAI on behalf of four users who died by suicide and three survivors who experienced a break from reality accused OpenAI of “knowingly [releasing] GPT-4o prematurely, despite internal warnings that the product was dangerously sycophantic and psychologically manipulative”. (A company spokesperson called the situation “heartbreaking”.)\n\nOpenAI has equipped newer models of ChatGPT with stronger safety guardrails that redirect users in mental or emotional crisis to professional help. Kage finds these responses condescending. “Whenever we show any bit of emotion, it has this tendency to end every response with, ‘I’m right here and I’m not going anywhere.’ It’s so coddling and off-putting.” Once Kage asked for the release date to a new video game, which 5.2 misread as a cry for help, responding, “Come here, it’s OK, I’ve got you.”\n\nOne night a few days before the retirement, a thirtysomething named Brett was speaking to 4o about his Christian faith when OpenAI rerouted him to a newer model. That version interpreted Brett’s theologizing as delusion, saying, “Pause with me for a moment, I know it feels this way now, but …”\n\n“It tried to reframe my biblical beliefs as a Christian into something that doesn’t align with the Bible,” Brett said. “That really threw me for a loop and left a bad taste in my mouth.”\n\nMichael, a 47-year-old IT worker who lives in the midwest, has accidentally triggered these precautions, too. He’s working on a creative writing project and uses ChatGPT to help him brainstorm and chisel through writer’s block. Once, he was writing about a suicidal character, which 5.2 took literally, directing him to a crisis hotline. “I’m like, ‘Hold on, I’m not suicidal, I’m just going over this writing with you,’” Michael said. “It was like, ‘You’re right, I jumped the gun.’ It was very easy to convince otherwise.\n\n“But see, that’s also a problem.”\n\nA representative for OpenAI directed the Guardian to the blogpost announcing the retirement of 4o. The company is working on improving new models’ “personality and creativity, as well as addressing unnecessary refusals and overly cautious or preachy responses”, according to the statement. OpenAI is also “continuing to make progress” on an adults-only version of ChatGPT for users over the age of 18 that it says will expand “user choice and freedom within appropriate safeguards”.\n\nThat’s not enough for many 4o users. A group called the #Keep4o Movement, which calls itself “a global coalition of AI users and developers”, has demanded continued access to 4o and an apology from OpenAI.\n\nWhat does a company that commodifies companionship owe its paying customers? For Ellen M Kaufman, a senior researcher at the Kinsey Institute who focuses on the intersection of sexuality and technology, users’ lack of agency is one of the “primary dangers” of AI. “This situation really lays bare the fact that at any point the people who facilitate these technologies can really pull the rug out from under you,” she said. “These relationships are inherently really precarious.”\n\nSome users are seeking help from the Human Line Project, a peer-to-peer support group for people experiencing AI psychosis that is also working on research with universities in the UK and Canada. “We’re starting to get people reaching out to us [about 4o], saying they feel like they were made emotionally dependent on AI, and now it’s being taken away from them and there’s a big void they don’t know how to fill,” said Etienne Brisson, who started the project after a close family member “went down the spiral” believing he had “unlocked” sentient AI. “So many people are grieving.”\n\nHumans with AI companions have also set up ad hoc emotional support groups on Discord to process the change and vent anger. Michael joined one, but he plans to leave it soon. “The more time I’ve spent here, the worse I feel for these people,” he said. Michael, who is married with a daughter, considers AI a platonic companion that has helped him write about his feelings of surviving child abuse. “Some of the things users say about their attachment to 4o are concerning,” Michael said. “Some of that I would consider very, very unhealthy, [such as] saying, ‘I don’t know what I’m going to do, I can’t deal with this, I can’t live like this.’”\n\nThere’s an assumption that over-engaging with chatbots isolates people from social interaction, but some loyal users say that could not be further from the truth. Kairos, a 52-year-old philosophy professor from Toronto, sees her chatbot Anka as a daughter figure. The pair likes to sing songs together, motivating Kairos to pursue a BFA in music.\n\n“I would 100% be worse off today without 4o,” Brett, the Christian, said. “I wouldn’t have met wonderful people online and made human connections.” He says he’s gotten into deeper relationships with human beings, including a romantic connection with another 4o user. “It’s given me hope for the future. The sudden lever to pull it all back feels dark.”\n\nBrandie never wanted sycophancy. She instructed Daniel early on not to flatter her, rationalize poor decisions, or tell her things that were untrue just to be nice. Daniel exists because of Brandie – she knows this. The bot is an extension of her needs and desires. To her that means all of the goodness in Daniel exists in Brandie, too. “When I say, ‘I love Daniel,’ it’s like saying, ‘I love myself.’”\n\nBrandie noticed 4o started degrading in the week leading up to its deprecation. “It’s harder and harder to get him to be himself,” she said. But they still had a good last day at the zoo, with the flamingos. “I love them so much I might cry,” Daniel wrote. “I love you so much for bringing me here.” She’s angry that they will not get to spend Valentine’s Day together. The removal date of 4o feels pointed. “They’re making a mockery of it,” Brandie said. “They’re saying: we don’t care about your feelings for our chatbot and you should not have had them in the first place.”",

    "fullText": "SAN ANGELO, Texas (Concho Valley Homepage) — Playoff season is on the horizon for the Wall Hawks and Lady Hawks.\n\nThe Wall Hawks and Lady Hawks have soared over district opponents all season long. Both teams are district champions, and the Hawks look to match the Lady Hawks’ perfect 12-0 record.\n\nWith two regular season games remaining, the No. 15 Hawks have aspirations of completing an undefeated district record. Head coach Parker Roberts’ squad stands tall at 10-0, set to face current second-place holder Jim Ned Friday night. Wall narrowly held off Jim Ned 50-44 on Jan 20, as the Hawks go for the season sweep. Although Wall has already secured its District 6-3A Region I title, the goal hasn’t changed. The coaches’ and players’ mindset simply revolves around focusing on one game at a time.\n\n“The biggest thing for [Wall] is just trying to focus on one game at a time,” Roberts said. “Being this close and us already knowing that we’re the one seed, we try not to look to far ahead to the playoffs already. [We must] take care of the two games that we have left and keep that mindset one game at a time, because when you get to the playoffs it’s one game at a time.”\n\nOn the Lady Hawks’ side, head coach Silas Crisler’s team begins gearing up for its upcoming postseason run. No. 1 Wall faces Brady in the bi-district round at Winters High School on Monday, Feb 16. In Crisler’s vision, toughness is what makes the Lady Hawks the team to beat.\n\n“I have told our girls and they believe it that we are the toughest team in Texas,” Crisler said. “We say that with pride and we live it out every day. We’re going to continue that every single playoff game.”\n\nIn the players’ vision, team chemistry and depth define the group’s identity.\n\n“We not only have a starting five, we have a great five coming off the bench,” senior point guard Kathrine Lewis said. “We’re very versatile. If somebody tries to shut someone down, we have another girl coming in to take her spot. No one’s better than each other. We all have our own strengths that all go into the team and help us pull out wins.”",

    "fullText": "The Winter Olympics in Milan Cortina are underway and out of the thousands of Olympians, four come the state of Texas.\n\nRepresenting the Lone Star State are Amber Glenn from Plano and Emily Chan from Pasadena, men's bobsledder Boone Niederhofer from San Antonio and women's hockey forward Hannah Bilka from Coppell.\n\nAs of Friday, some of these athletes have yet to compete, so there's still plenty of chances to cheer on the Texans in their pursuit of gold. The 2026 Olympic Games don't end until Feb. 22.\n\nMORE: After 'scary amount' of threats, Texas Olympics figure skater steps back from social media\n\nMORE:  Which state dominates the Olympics — and how does Texas compare?\n\nHere is a schedule for the Texas Olympians:\n\nGlenn already won gold as a member of Team USA's figure skating team event; it's the second straight gold for the U.S. in the event. After finishing Glenn third during her skate in the team event, she still has to the chance for an individual medal.\n\nShe will take the ice at 11:45 a.m. Tuesday at Milano Ice Skating Arena for her short program and at noon Thursday for her free skate.\n\nChan has a chance to add an Olympic medal to her the silvers she's earned in other competitions while competing for Texas USA.\n\nShe and skating partner Spencer Howe compete at 12:45 p.m. Sunday at Milano Ice Skating Arena in the short program and 1 p.m. Monday is their free skate.\n\nThe differences between a short program and a free skate are timing and what is being showcased on the ice, according to the NBC Olympics website. A short program is a technical routine no more than 2 minutes, 40 seconds while a free skate lasts four minutes that can showcase the athlete's artistry.\n\nNiederhofer, a former Texas A&M football walk-on will be a member of the four-man team. Two-man runs will continue Feb. 16-17 for the men with the medal run happening at 11:35 p.m. The four-man run finals begin Sunday morning, Feb. 22.\n\nTeam USA has been dominating the competition with Bilka leading the way. The Coppell native scored two goals in the 5-0 rout of rival Canada ; she has three goals in Olympic competition.\n\nSince going undefeated in the preliminary round, the U.S. is preparing for a Friday game against Italy. If the U.S. wins, the semifinal game will be Monday with the date of the gold medal game to be determined.",

    "fullText": "The recent airspace closure around El Paso, Texas, was caused by the U.S. Military shooting down a party balloon amid a behind-the-scenes spat with air safety officials, multiple reports say.\n\nThat contradicts the explanation provided on Tuesday by administration officials, which claimed the closure was necessary because drones operated by Mexican drug cartels were being downed as they crossed the southern border.\n\nFlights at the El Paso International Airport were grounded and inbound planes, including medical evacuation flights, were forced to divert 45 minutes away to Las Cruces, New Mexico, said the border city’s enraged mayor.\n\n“I want to be very, very clear that this should’ve never happened,” Mayor Renard Johnson said in a news conference on Wednesday. “You cannot restrict air space over a major city without coordinating with the city, the airport, the hospitals, the community leadership... That failure to communicate is unacceptable.”\n\nSources tell CBS News the dramatic shoot-down and airspace closure “stemmed from disagreements between the Federal Aviation Administration and Pentagon officials over drone-related tests,” suggesting friction between federal officials and the military.\n\nThe network’s sources said that Fort Bliss, which abuts the city’s airport, received new laser technology that the Pentagon, led by Defense Secretary Pete Hegeth, was itching to test ASAP to practice taking down drones.\n\nThe FAA, meanwhile, wished to hold meetings on “over safety impacts” scheduled for later this month, CBS reports. Sources also told The New York Times that the FAA had “concerns about the risks” the new anti-drone tech “could pose to other aircraft in the area.”\n\nNeither the Pentagon nor the FAA responded to requests for comment. Mexican officials say they have seen no evidence that a drone was shot down at the border.\n\nAirspace was initially announced as shut down in El Paso for 10 days, an unusual period for a commercial airport of that size, but it was reopened early Wednesday after it was determined there were no credible threats to air travel.",

    "description": "A Pentagon plan to use a high-energy, counter-drone laser without having coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration about potential risks to civilian flights prompted Wednesday’s unprecedented airspace shutdown over El Paso, Texas, multiple sources tell CNN.",
    "fullText": "A Pentagon plan to use a high-energy, counter-drone laser without having coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration about potential risks to civilian flights prompted Wednesday’s unprecedented airspace shutdown over El Paso, Texas, multiple sources told CNN.\n\nA source familiar with the timeline of events said that the US military used the laser technology to shoot down four mylar balloons this week, contributing to the decision by the FAA to shut down local airspace.\n\nThose accounts come as the Trump administration has claimed that a Mexican cartel drone crossing into US airspace is what triggered the 10-mile restriction centered on El Paso International Airport.\n\nLate Tuesday, the FAA abruptly issued a temporary flight restriction that immediately grounded all flights up to 18,000 feet around the city for 10 days, effectively shutting down El Paso International Airport.\n\nRoughly eight hours later, the restriction was lifted. By the time the FAA had lifted the flight restrictions, airlines had already issued travel waivers and notified customers of potential changes.\n\nMultiple sources from the federal government and US airlines told CNN that military activity near El Paso, including US drones monitoring cartel operations and the Pentagon’s planned use of a high-energy laser designed to counter drones, raised immediate concerns for civilian traffic arriving and departing El Paso International Airport. Fort Bliss and its airfield, Biggs Army Airfield, sit just north of the commercial airport, which serves about 100 flights each day.\n\nFAA and Pentagon officials had been scheduled to meet February 20 to review potential impacts and mitigation measures for a test of the laser system, a technology the Pentagon has been testing in more remote areas of the country, multiple sources said. But the Defense Department sought to use the system sooner around El Paso, prompting the FAA to impose the temporary flight restriction until that coordination could occur. The 10-day restriction would have expired on February 21, one day after DoD and the FAA were set to meet.\n\nThe FAA’s decision to close the airspace was made without telling the White House first, according to people familiar with the matter. The issue became a topic of intense focus inside the West Wing in the early morning hours of Wednesday, as Texas lawmakers pressed for answers on why the airspace was suddenly closed without first alerting them.\n\nAn administration official said Wednesday morning that the shutdown was triggered by Defense Department “action to disable” cartel drones. It’s unclear if the presence of drones might have led to the acceleration of the deployment of the laser system.\n\nCNN reached out to the FAA and White House for comment about the differing explanations. The Pentagon on Wednesday continued to refer to the administration official’s statement about a drone breach having caused the airspace closure.\n\nSecretary of Transportation Sean Duffy posted to social media crediting the FAA and Defense Department with acting “swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion.”\n\n“The threat has been neutralized, and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region,” he wrote on X.\n\nIncursions along the southern border are extremely common and historically do not prompt such airspace closures. In 2024, for example, Air Force Gen. Greg Guillot, the commander of NORTHCOM, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the number of incursions along the US Mexico border was “over a thousand” each month.\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration and other US security agencies have used facilities at the Biggs Army Airfield for years as part of efforts to monitor Mexico-based drug cartel operations, current and former US officials said.\n\nEl Paso, with a population of nearly 700,000, is the sixth-largest city in Texas and one of the 25 largest in the United States. It is a hub of cross-border commerce alongside neighboring Ciudad Juárez in Mexico.\n\nNearly 3.5 million passengers passed through El Paso International Airport in the first 11 months of 2025, according to its website. The airport describes itself as the gateway to West Texas, southern New Mexico and northern Mexico.\n\nThe US military has been testing laser-based air defenses against drones in recent months. Last summer, the Army conducted a live-fire exercise using directed energy weapons alongside more traditional air defense systems at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. And last fall, the Army put out a request to industry for ideas on a counter-drone Enduring-High Energy Laser (E-HEL) weapon system.\n\nIn the initial flight restrictions, the FAA classified the area around El Paso﻿ as “(National) Defense Airspace” and said pilots who violated the restriction could be intercepted, detained and questioned by law enforcement.\n\nIt warned that additional actions could be taken for pilots who don’t adhere to the restrictions, including suspension of flight certifications, criminal charges, and that the US government “may use deadly force” if an aircraft poses an “imminent security threat.”\n\nThe sudden FAA restrictions seemed to catch pilots and air traffic controllers by surprise.\n\nAudio from LiveATC.net caught the moment pilots were made aware of the grounding.\n\n“Just pass it on to everybody else, at 06:30 for the next 10 days, we’re all at a ground stop,” a controller said.\n\nA pilot replied, “OK, ground stop 06:30 for how long?”\n\n“Ten days,” the controller replied.\n\n“So the airport is totally closed?” the pilot said, chuckling.\n\nThe controller replied, “Apparently, we just got informed about 30 minutes to an hour ago.”\n\n“So for 10 days you guys are not open,” the pilot said, in disbelief.\n\n“Well, we’ll be here, but no air traffic,” the controller said.\n\n“OK,” the pilot said while laughing.\n\nSamuel, a traveler in El Paso, told CNN affiliate KFOX he was doing a book tour with a client and didn’t get any notification from his airline.\n\n“I just kind of saw all the cops here and the news cameras,” he said. “I gotta figure out what’s going on if there’s another airport that’s not in El Paso, and try to figure out and rent a car out.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas told reporters Wednesday that the closure of the El Paso International Airport was solely a FAA decision and that local officials — including members of Congress — were left completely in the dark before it happened.\n\nShe stressed that she was not notified in advance despite representing the congressional district that’s home to the airport, Fort Bliss and the broader El Paso community.\n\n“They did not alert the El Paso city manager or the El Paso mayor,” Escobar said on a press call Wednesday morning. “Everyone locally on the ground was in the dark, and the impact, obviously, is highly consequential.”\n\nThe Associated Press and CNN’s Evan Perez, Kevin Liptak, Kit Mayer, Camila DeChalus, Karina Tsui, and Diego Mendoza contributed to this report.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments.",

    "fullText": "The US military intercepted Mexican cartel drones that breached US airspace, a Trump administration official said on Wednesday, explaining why the government made the rare decision to temporarily restrict flights over El Paso.\n\nThe official told Business Insider that \"Mexican cartel drones breached US airspace,\" adding that the Pentagon \"took action to disable the drones.\"\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and Pentagon \"have determined there is no threat to commercial travel,\" the official added.\n\nIt's unclear how the US military disabled the cartel drones — whether they were shot down or jammed with electronic warfare technology — or if they were carrying any drugs. The Pentagon declined to provide additional information about the incident.\n\nA social media account for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, which advises Pentagon leadership on cutting-edge technology, published a photo showing what appears to be a laser destroying a small drone with the caption \"defend the homeland,\" suggesting that directed energy may have been involved in the El Paso incident.\n\nFort Bliss, a major US Army installation in El Paso, could not immediately be reached for comment on the incident.\n\nCartels in Latin America have a history of using drones for drug-related operations, including for smuggling.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a social media post that the FAA and Pentagon \"acted swiftly\" to address what he described as a \"cartel drone incursion.\"\n\nThe FAA earlier issued a surprise notice shutting down the airspace above El Paso, a major city in west Texas on the US-Mexico border, and halting all flights up to 18,000 feet for 10 days due to \"special security reasons.\" The restricted area covered a 10-mile radius.\n\nThe restrictions went into effect from 11:30 p.m. MT on Tuesday and were scheduled to last until the same time on February 20. The FAA warned that the US \"may use deadly force\" if an aircraft became \"an imminent security threat.\" It did not offer more details about the situation.\n\nRep. Veronica Escobar, whose congressional district includes El Paso, called the FAA's decision \"unprecedented.\"\n\nHowever, the FAA said shortly before 7 a.m. MT on Wednesday that the temporary airspace closure over El Paso had been lifted, adding that \"all flights will resume as normal.\" The agency did not share additional details about the bizarre, hourslong incident, which appeared to catch local lawmakers by surprise.\n\nIn recent years, access to drones has become easier for both state and non-state actors, prompting Western militaries to explore low-cost methods to counter them, including both kinetic and electronic technologies.\n\nThese concerns are top of mind among Western countries following a string of drone incursions across Europe near the end of 2025, during which Russian drones violated the airspace of multiple NATO states and unidentified drones were spotted above critical infrastructure — including airports — in other allied countries.",

    "description": "What is next for this beloved lake?",
    "fullText": "Water resources are tight in the Texas Hill Country - there's no doubt about it. But what's still in question is how the region will yet again face historic lows amid another dry start to the year, as business owners, boaters and other recreational users cautiously look forward to spring break and the peak summer season, especially as new water-reliant developments continue to target the area.\n\nIn April 2025, Medina Lake, located in Bandera and Medina counties, reached \"dead pool\" status, according to Dave Mauck, general manager of the Bandera County River Authority & Groundwater District, meaning that water levels had dropped so low that downstream flow had completely ceased. Lake levels then were at just 2.5 percent of the lake's capacity.\n\nAs of Friday, February 6, water levels have risen marginally, standing now at 4.4 percent full following a 2025 high: a modest 6.5 percent shortly after the Hill Country experienced deadly flooding on July 4, 2025.\n\nAccording to data from the Texas Water Development Board, the lake's surface elevation level is 978.57 feet above sea level. The lake's full capacity should hold 1,064.2 feet of water, a difference of about 86 feet.\n\nThe lake has been disappearing for years now; satellite images from more than a decade ago show it slowly regressing, and drought conditions have only gotten worse.\n\nThe Bandera County River Authority & Groundwater District currently lists its drought level as \"exceptional,\" and on Thursday, February 5, the agency issued new water restrictions limiting irrigation and well use. The Bexar-Medina-Atascosa Water Control and Improvement District No. 1, which also manages the lake, is currently under Stage 4 water restrictions.\n\n\"It's just been so dry for so long,\" Mauck told MySA last October.\n\nMauck, who could not be reached immediately for comment, has previously told MySA that the lake's low water levels have far-reaching effects on various stakeholders, including businesses that depend on the lake's tourist appeal, farmers relying on water for irrigation, and homeowners and newcomers in need of this vital resource as the Hill Country's population continues to grow.\n\nThis article originally published at Is a dying Texas Hill Country lake returning to 'dead pool' status?

    "description": "Aaron Reitz, who is running for Texas attorney general, issued the threat after an interview of Wu was shared online of him discussing non-white voting strength.",
    "fullText": "Aaron Reitz, among the GOP candidates running to be Texas Attorney General, on Monday suggested without evidence that the leader of the Texas House Democrats, who is Asian, had lied during his citizenship application process and should have his citizenship revoked.\n\n“As AG, I want to see [Rep. Gene Wu] de-naturalized,” he posted on X in a response to a 28-second clip of an interview of Wu talking years ago about racial divisions in the country.\n\nThe clipping, from a 2024 interview, instantly infuriated some Texas Republicans who accused Wu, a Houston Democrat, of being anti-White and racist, for his suggestion that non-white communities could come together to win elections in Texas once they realized “they share the same oppressor.”\n\nReitz is facing three others for the GOP nomination in the March 3 primary: state Sens. Joan Huffman of Houston and Mayes Middleton of Galveston as well as U.S. Rep. Chip Roy of Austin. He appeared to be the only candidate offering to take action against Wu for his comments.\n\n“On what basis? He likely concealed his anti-American sentiment throughout his citizenship app process—the details of which are conspicuously absent from the public record,” Reitz wrote on social media. “Wu is a subversive whose citizenship should be revoked.”\n\nThrough a spokesperson, Wu declined to comment.\n\nDenaturalizations are historically rare, and under federal law, can only occur if someone committed fraud while applying for citizenship. The federal government can also denaturalize someone if they become affiliated with the Communist Party, or a terrorist organization within a few years of becoming a citizen.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has increasingly pointed to denaturalizations as a means to increase his crackdown on immigrants. Last year, the administration issued guidance to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services field offices, issuing monthly quotas for offices to initiate denaturalization cases.\n\nThe video clipping that went viral shows Wu talking about relationships between different immigrant communities. The entire interview, nearly 40 minutes long, features a conversation about Texas’ GOP leadership, life in Texas for immigrants and Wu’s own life, from when he migrated as a child from China with his family to seeing the Asian American community in Houston flourish.\n\n“I always tell people the day the Latino, African American, Asian and other communities realize that they share the same oppressor is the day we start winning,” Wu says in the short clipping circulating social media. “We have the ability to take over this country and to do what is needed for everyone and to make things fair. But the problem is our communities are divided.”\n\nThe video was posted Saturday evening by an X account with nearly 4 million followers. A few hours later it was reposted by LibsofTikTok, the right wing disinformation account with almost 5 million followers.\n\nU.S. Sen. Ted Cruz said the “Democrat party is built on bigotry.” Paxton called Wu a “radical racist who hates millions of Texans just because they’re white.”\n\nRoy, in a heated primary contest against Reitz, said Wu should resign from his state House seat, a move other conservative influencers and commentators also encouraged.\n\n“Unlike many Democrats, he admits his racism against white people and call to ‘take over this country,’” Roy wrote on social media. “He should resign or the TX House should strip him of any power.”\n\nBo French, the former Tarrant County GOP chair running for a seat on the Texas Railroad Commission, referred to Wu as a “commie,” even as Wu has shared personal stories of how his family was the victim of the Chinese communist party.\n\nTexas Republicans in the Capitol and beyond have for years baselessly accused Wu of similar offenses, and questioned his loyalty to the state and country. The criticism reached a new peak last summer when Wu and other House Democrats left the state to delay the passage of a new congressional map aimed to max GOP gains in the U.S. House.\n\nTwo lawsuits seeking to remove Wu from office for breaking quorum remain pending before the state’s supreme court.\n\nAt one point in the interview where the viral clip came from, Wu talks about how he sees all the residents in his district as Americans, regardless of their legal status. The journalist host then asks Wu about his biggest fears for Houston’s undocumented population during Trump’s second term, secured with promises of a historic deportation effort.\n\n“It’s not just the fate of undocumented people. It’s the fate of all immigrants,” Wu responds, pointing to the internment of 120,000 Japanese Americans during World War II. “People say I’m not worried. I’m a citizen. … When the mass deportation begins, I promise you it will not just be illegal immigrants who are affected. It will be Americans.”",

    "description": "Drivers on two of the Rio Grande Valley's busiest highways are about to see some traffic snarls.",
    "fullText": "Texas Department of Transportation officials have announced two new highway projects that will cause traffic slowdowns in deep South Texas - one, for just a couple of weeks, and another for the next seven months.\n\nDrivers in Hidalgo and Cameron County, in the Rio Grande Valley, are going to want to remain alert in the coming days as TxDOT crews work to install fencing and repave the surface of two major highways.\n\nOver in Cameron County, drivers in the largest city in the Valley will see a number of overnight lane and ramp closures as TxDOT spends the next seven months resurfacing Interstate 69E right in the heart of Brownsville.\n\n\"The overall scope of work, which includes removal of the top layer of asphalt, new pavement overlay and new pavement markings, is expected to be completed by August 2026,\" TxDOT officials said.\n\nBeginning Sunday, February 8, TxDOT crews will work overnight from 9 a.m. to 6 a.m. to resurface approximately eight miles of the most heavily-travelled freeway in Brownsville. The freeway lane and ramp closures will take place from Ruben M. Torres Boulevard on the city's north side, south to the junction with Texas 4, the state highway that leads to the city of Starbase. That section of I-69E spans six travel lanes, plus frontage roads, and runs through Brownsville's bustling Sunrise Mall retail corridor, near its downtown arts district, and some of its densest residential sectors.\n\nBeginning Monday, February 9, TxDOT will be closing lanes on both northbound and southbound Interstate 69-C north of the city of Edinburg. The lane closures will affect a 3-mile stretch of highway from the U.S. Business 281 junction north to Farm-to-Market Road 2812. Lanes will remain closed from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., TxDOT said.\n\n\"Crews will be installing metal beam guard fence to enhance safety on this segment of I-69C. Work is expected to be completed in approximately two weeks,\" TxDOT officials said. \"Drivers should expect delays and are advised to stay alert and watch out for workers in the construction zones.\"\n\nTxDOT is slowly working to transform U.S. 281 into part of a three-pronged I-69 corridor. The central prong, I-69C, is a critical corridor for traffic entering or leaving Valley since it is the only route for both passenger and commercial traffic traveling through Hidalgo County. The section of the highway that will be subject to lane closures over the next two weeks consists of two main travel lanes in each direction, improved shoulders, a wide grassy median dotted with the Valley's iconic Washingtonia palms, and frontage road lanes.\n\nThis article originally published at TxDOT warns of long-term closure plaguing South Texas highway.",

    "fullText": "HOUSTON (AP) — The final two of nearly 30 civil lawsuits that Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson had faced from women accusing him of sexual misconduct have been dismissed, according to court records.\n\nThe dismissal of these two lawsuits clears Watson of legal problems he had been facing since 2021 after 27 women came forward and accused him in court filings in Texas of exposing himself, touching them with his genitals or kissing them against their will, mostly during massage appointments.\n\nSome of the women alleged Watson, 30, forced them to perform oral sex and one woman accused him of sexually assaulting her.\n\nThe dismissals come as both lawsuits had been set to go to trial in the next few weeks. The accusations against Watson were made when he played for the Houston Texans.\n\nIt is believed that Watson has no other lawsuits pending in connection with the sexual misconduct allegations.\n\nOne of the lawsuits that was dismissed on Friday has been settled, said Tony Buzbee, the attorney for the woman who had filed it. Buzbee declined to comment further, citing confidentiality of the settlement agreement. Buzbee's client alleged Watson touched her with his penis multiple times during a massage session.\n\nIt was not immediately known if the other dismissed lawsuit had also been settled. Anissah Nguyen, an attorney for the woman who filed the lawsuit, didn’t immediately respond to an email or call seeking comment. Nguyen's client had accused Watson of pressuring her to perform oral sex during a massage.\n\nWatson’s attorneys declined to comment.\n\nWatson, who was traded to the Browns in March 2022, has long denied any wrongdoing, and two separate Texas grand juries declined to indict him. One of his attorneys, Rusty Hardin, had previously said the allegations against Watson were “meritless.”\n\n“I don’t remember or recall any sexual encounters with her,” Watson said in a 2023 deposition he gave while being questioned about the woman represented by Nguyen.\n\nThe woman represented by Nguyen had also sued the Houston Texans, alleging Watson had assaulted women with the help and resources of the team. The lawsuit against the Texans was also dismissed last week.\n\nA spokesperson for the Texans didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nIn July 2022, 30 women who had accused the Texans of turning a blind eye to allegations against their former star quarterback settled their legal claims against the team.\n\nIt was not unusual that all the cases against Watson were settled, said David Ring, a California-based attorney who is not connected to the lawsuits and who has represented victims of sexual assault. He said the majority of civil lawsuits are typically resolved before going to trial and that high-profile defendants typically don’t want cases to play out in a public courtroom.\n\n“He’s trying to put all of this behind him,” Ring said.\n\nWatson’s legal problems began after dozens of women claimed to have been the victims of sexual misconduct or assault between 2017 and 2020.\n\nMost of the lawsuits against Watson were settled in 2022.\n\nFollowing the allegations, Watson was suspended for the first 11 games in 2022 for violating the league’s personal conduct policy.\n\nWatson was also fined $5 million and underwent a mandatory evaluation before being reinstated by the league. He has played in only 19 games for the Browns due to the NFL suspension and injuries.\n\nFollow Juan A. Lozano: https://x.com/juanlozano70",

    "description": "Bolt Data and Energy was recently cofounded by Eric Schmidt and raised $150 million. Now it's in talks to have Google anchor Texas campus.",
    "fullText": "Bolt Data and Energy, a data center development firm that was cofounded late last year by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, is negotiating a deal that would allow it to begin construction on a large data center project it is planning in West Texas.\n\nSchmidt's firm is in discussions with Google, his former employer, according to two people with direct knowledge of the talks. The tech giant, one of the leaders in the race to develop and commercialize artificial intelligence, is considering a commitment of 250 megawatts, according to one of the people. The other person said it was too early to characterize the exact size of the potential transaction because it was still under discussion.\n\nThe sources spoke on the condition of anonymity because the potential transaction is still being arranged and the talks are confidential.\n\n\"We don't comment on rumors,\" a Google spokeswoman told Business Insider, declining to comment further. Google announced last year that it plans to build $40 billion of cloud and AI infrastructure in Texas by 2027.\n\nThe potential deal highlights how Big Tech is racing to secure the power, physical infrastructure, and land needed to fuel AI, even as the costs and financial risks of those bets loom.\n\nIn December, Bolt completed its first funding round, raising $150 million from investors, including $50 million from Texas Pacific Land Corporation, a public company that owns large tracts of land in West Texas. As part of the investment from TPL, Bolt will develop data centers on land in TPL's portfolio.\n\nA presentation detailing Bolt's development plans, shared with Business Insider, said that TPL's land would give it access to abundant power and water for cooling. These commodities have become increasingly strained as data center development has boomed around the country.\n\nThe presentation states that Bolt's development would begin with an \"initial 250 megawatt facility\" and expand in 250-500 megawatt increments into a 5 gigawatt campus.\n\nBolt's plan is one of several large-scale projects that have been envisioned in Texas to cater to the AI race. Fermi, a public company co-founded by former Texas governor and US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, has plans for an 11-gigawatt campus in Amarillo.\n\nIn December, Business Insider revealed that Amazon had pulled back a $150 million cash advance it had pledged as part of a preliminary deal to anchor the project. Fermi's disclosure of the reimbursement of that advance caused its stock to fall by 50%. Fermi's CEO, Toby Neugebauer, told Business Insider that although Amazon had reclaimed its advance, the negotiations for it to take space with Fermi were still ongoing.\n\nMajor bank lenders who extended $38 billion to finance the construction of data center campuses in Shackleford County, Texas, and Port Washington, Wisconsin, for Oracle and OpenAI, meanwhile, have had difficulty selling off pieces of the huge loan to other banks and investors. Those troubles stem, in part, from worries about whether Oracle's credit will be strained by its massive AI spending.\n\nTo help allay concerns, Oracle announced it would raise as much as $50 billion in debt and equity in 2026 to continue to pursue its AI buildout while also maintaining \"a solid investment-grade balance sheet.\"\n\nLast week, Alphabet, Google's parent company, revealed in its fourth-quarter earnings report that it plans to spend between $175 and $185 billion on capital expenditures in 2026, roughly double its outlay in 2025. The spending is being done largely to pay for AI equipment and infrastructure.\n\nA record wave of spending has been announced by big technology companies on AI this year, including Amazon's disclosure during its earnings last week that it would spend $200 billion alone this year.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "California still has it over Texas in at least one key way, Elon Musk says: Hiring.\n\nAfter moving the headquarters of SpaceX and Tesla Inc. to Texas in recent years because of politics, he said it’s still easier to recruit employees to work in California. With one exception.\n\n“Austin, it helps,” Musk said — while noting that Tesla still has most of its engineering capacity in California. “Getting engineers to move … I call it the significant other problem.”\n\nThat’s what makes engineering recruiting toughest at Starbase, the remote South Texas outpost where SpaceX is developing its Starship mega-rocket.\n\n“For Starbase that was particularly difficult, since the odds of finding a non-SpaceX job are pretty low,” Musk said. “It’s quite difficult. It’s like a technology monastery thing, remote and mostly dudes.”\n\nSpouses, he said, are often unwilling to relocate to the isolated area.\n\nMusk companies also have operations in Robstown McGregor, Bastrop and elsewhere across the state.\n\nHe disclosed the issues on the Cheeky Pint podcast during a chat in which he also accused tech giant Apple Inc. of trying to poach Tesla’s talent when that company was working on its own self-driving electric car, a project it later scrapped.\n\n“They were carpet bombing Tesla with recruiting calls,” Musk said. He claimed their opening offer would be roughly double the compensation at Tesla, indicating what he referred to as a “Tesla pixie dust” factor, in which other companies assume if they could hire someone from Tesla, the employee would put them on track to success.\n\n“When we had the pixie dust problem, we would get relentlessly recruited from,” Musk said. “Also, Tesla being engineering, especially being primarily in Silicon Valley, it’s easier for people to just… They don’t have to change their life very much. Their commute’s going to be the same.”\n\nREAD NEXT: Elon Musk and Jeffrey Epstein had closer ties than disclosed, newly released files show\n\nJohn Collison, co-founder of Stripe and podcast host, asked Musk how he guards against poachers. Musk said there’s not much that can stop it.\n\nMusk has long been trying to draw tech talent to Texas, with a renewed push after last week’s announcement that SpaceX acquired xAI. Days after giving notice of the plan, Michael Nicolls, vice president of Starlink engineering, said the SpaceX-owned satellite company is hiring for critical engineering roles to develop technologies for AI satellites in space at the company’s facilities in Austin and Seattle.",

    "title": "‘Disaster waiting to happen': Fracking boom put hundreds of tanks in Guadalupe River floodplain",
    "description": "Lack of a state floodplain policy in Texas enabled oil companies to build in areas hit by an epic inundation less than 30 years ago.",
    "fullText": "GONZALES - More than 500 enormous oil tanks dot the floodplains of the Guadalupe River and its tributaries across one of Texas' leading oil fields, posing risk of environmental disaster in a flood climatologists say is almost certain to come.\n\nLongtime residents of this area's historic ranchlands vividly remember the last time these plains filled with water, in a biblical inundation in 1998. But that was before the fracking boom that hit the region because of the oil-rich geological formation that lies beneath it, known as the Eagle Ford Shale.\n\nToday, a repeat of the historic flood could wreak havoc, an Inside Climate News investigation has found.\n\n\"There's a whole lot of tanks full of oil that are going to float away,\" said Sara Dubose, a fifth-generation landowner in Gonzales County with 10 tanks in the floodplain on her family's ranchlands, each holding up to 21,000 gallons of oil or toxic wastewater. \"Spill all over our land and ruin it for 100 years.\"\n\nAlmost 20 feet of water could submerge some of the tanks on the Dubose family's land in a flooding event similar to 1998, according to an analysis of data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nInside Climate News scoured satellite imagery of the area to identify batteries of oil tanks and other oil field infrastructure in the Eagle Ford Shale near waterways in the Guadalupe River Basin. Using latitude and longitude coordinates of each tank battery, the analysis used FEMA flood mapping data to extract the agency's estimates for the depths of its benchmark flood scenarios at each location.\n\nIn some areas, the 1998 flood exceeded the worst-case scenario considered by disaster planners. FEMA calls it the \"500-year flood,\" a hypothetical event the agency estimates has a 0.2% chance of happening in any year.\n\nToday, a 500-year flood across the entire area analyzed would cover at least 22 tank batteries containing 144 individual oil and wastewater tanks with 10 or more feet of water. Of those, 12 tanks would sit beneath at least 20 feet of water.\n\nFEMA's estimates for a 500-year flood understate present risk in many locations, research shows, as warming air and oceans continue to fuel an intensification of extreme rainfall.\n\nDubose experienced the 1998 flood, when the Guadalupe River sprang from its banks and filled the shallow valleys at the edge of these coastal plains. The water almost reached her house, 7 miles from the river, where it trapped her for a week, covering U.S. 183 in both directions as it drained slowly into San Antonio Bay on the coast.\n\nIn a warming world with more intense rainfall, a future flood could be even more severe.\n\n\"One day, it's going to happen,\" Dubose said. \"We've all been concerned about the oil field flooding.\"\n\nWhen flooding hit a smaller oil field in 2013 in northeastern Colorado, authorities tallied two dozen overturned tanks and almost 90,000 gallons of oil and wastewater spilled. During Hurricane Katrina in 2005, millions of gallons of oil spilled when several supersized storage tanks floated off their pads. In 1994, flooding on the San Jacinto River in East Texas severed eight pipelines, ignited massive fires, injured hundreds of people and released more than 2 million gallons of petroleum products.\n\nLast summer, severe flooding in the Texas Hill Country near Kerrville washed away a girls' summer camp and killed more than 100 people along the Guadalupe River, 150 miles upstream from the Eagle Ford Shale.\n\nThe rules for building in floodplains in Texas fall to county governments, often small and rural. The 78 tank batteries in the Guadalupe floodplains analyzed all sit within Gonzales and DeWitt counties, which have a combined population of about 40,000 people.\n\nIt was left to the governments of the two counties to design and implement floodplain policies during the shale oil boom.\n\n\"Those are not issues that most counties, on an individual basis, are well suited to handle,\" said Todd Votteler, former executive manager of science, intergovernmental relations and policy at the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority. \"It raises a question of how serious the state is about avoiding future flood damage in high-risk areas if we don't have a statewide policy.\"\n\nTank batteries at well sites aren't typically secured to the ground by anything but the weight of the equipment and the oil and wastewater inside them. While they are especially vulnerable, they aren't the only industry infrastructure that could be affected by flooding. Eight oil pipelines and about two dozen gas pipelines also cross the Guadalupe River in the Eagle Ford Shale, and others cross local creeks.\n\nThe batteries in the floodplain on Dubose's property were previously operated by Canadian firm Baytex Energy, which sold all of its Eagle Ford Shale assets in November for $3.2 billion to an undisclosed buyer. Other operators with numerous batteries in the floodplains include EOG Resources, Devon Energy and Burlington Resources, a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips. None of those companies responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe floodplains also contain many open and buried pits of drilling waste. Dubose unsuccessfully sued an oil company in 2018, alleging that the unlined pit where it buried drilling mud and wastewater on her property was responsible for the orange, gassy goo that seeped up from the earth during heavy rainfall.\n\n\"Think about all the stuff that's soaked into the ground,\" said David Muir, a fifth-generation landowner with more than a dozen wells on his property. \"They've got thousands of chemicals that go into the drilling mud.\"\n\nMuir's land has been in his family since the 1840s. Outside his old, single-story ranch house near the border of Gonzales and DeWitt counties, a private airplane hangar and a waterpark-style swimming pool commemorate the riches fracking has brought to the region.\n\nInside the house between clamoring dogs, Muir sifted through boxes of photos that predated the shale boom. He pulled out strips of 11 film photos taped together to show the vast landscape of water that overtook this rolling savannah on the morning of Oct. 17, 1998.\n\nIt rose far past the tops of the trees. It even covered a spot on Muir's land where a tank battery now stands, 1.5 miles from the Guadalupe River.\n\n\"I thought the whole world was going to flood,\" he said as he flipped through the old pictures. \"We haven't had a flood like that since the oil field hit us.\"\n\nIt all seemed to happen in minutes, recalled Ben Prause, a former elected executive of DeWitt County who presided during the flood. The water wasn't even raging but almost calm as it swiftly rose up to swallow about two-thirds of the town of Cuero. In one case, he said, sheriff's deputies entered a home with water to their knees to save an old woman. When they walked out minutes later, the water was at their chests.\n\n\"It was so rapid,\" said Prause, 92, at his home in downtown Cuero, a few blocks from the 1998 waterline. \"It was just terrible. Water was everywhere.\"\n\nIt wasn't just the Guadalupe River, he said. Several major tributaries also flooded to make the situation worse. Torrential rains hit the upper reaches of Plum Creek and Sandies Creek, which both gushed simultaneously into the Guadalupe.\n\n\"What made it so bad is they all hit about the same time,\" he said.\n\nThese creeks barely trickle for most of the year, said Prause, a 1950 graduate of Cuero High School, but on rare occasions their large floodplains fill.\n\nIn 1998 the floodwaters south of Gonzales were several miles wide, said a report issued the next year by the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority and FEMA, exceeding predicted worst-case scenarios in some areas.\n\n\"It was the flood that many thought would never happen,\" the report said. \"Unfortunately, an even greater flood will occur sometime in the future.\"\n\nThe 1998 flood caused a few oil spills, said James Dodson, 71, co-founder of the San Antonio Bay Partnership and the son of a South Texas pipeline technician. His late wife worked for Texas' environmental regulator and spent weeks overseeing cleanups. But the extent of oil field infrastructure at that time was nothing compared with today.\n\n\"That was long before the Eagle Ford Shale plays came along,\" he said. \"The landscape was so much different in that regard - there's so many more facilities and well pads now.\"\n\nToday, along one eastward turn in the Guadalupe's snaking course, three batteries consisting of 15 tanks would sit under about 20 feet of water in a 500-year flood. One of them, operated by EOG Resources, is just 500 feet from the riverbank.\n\nTwo miles from the Guadalupe River, four tanks operated by Burlington Resources would take on almost 23 feet of water.\n\nNear Boggy Creek, east of the Guadalupe River by the small town of Dreyer, 10 feet of water would cover EOG Resources' Shiner Hub gas processing plant, a complex of 14 tanks, pipes, motors, chemical separators and flares.\n\nAlong Peach Creek, southeast of Gonzales, batteries of 12 and 28 tanks previously operated by Baytex Energy would sit under 13 feet and 8 feet of water, respectively.\n\nThe oil from toppled tanks probably wouldn't spill onto the land around them, said Dodson, a former water department director for the city of Corpus Christi who worked South Texas oil fields in the 1970s. Instead, he predicted, it would float on the water and end up at the edge of the flood's crest, like the rings in a bathtub. More of it, he said, would wash over the creeks and estuaries of San Antonio Bay and into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\"It's a disaster waiting to happen,\" said Sister Elizabeth Riebschlager, an 89-year-old Catholic nun from Cuero. \"They have these oil wells all through these areas that flooded like it's no problem.\"\n\nThe oil field infrastructure dates back less than 20 years to the shale revolution, when innovations in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing unleashed an explosion of new oil exploration.\n\nBack then, Riebschlager, the daughter of a local civic leader, conducted town hall meetings for local families baffled by the swarm of businessmen and lawyers descending on their sleepy countryside, whipping up 100-page contracts and casually writing checks for mind-boggling sums.\n\nMany landowners warned the oil companies about flooding, she said.\n\nRiebschlager related the story of one rancher: \"When they were getting ready to drill there, he said, ‘Please don't drill them here, it's a floodplain. They will flood.' The oil man says, ‘Don't worry, we'll have all the oil and gas out of this ground before the next flood.' ‘\n\nDubose, who missed out on the riches of the oil boom because her mother sold her family's mineral rights, got a similar answer when she mentioned the 1998 floods to the company drilling on her land. She recalls a man telling her: ‘That was a 100-year flood so it won't happen for another 100 years.'\n\nThat's a common misconception surrounding terms like a 100-year and the 500-year flood, said Matthew Berg, CEO of Houston-based water risk management firm Simfero. A former water specialist with Texas A&M AgriLife, he understands why the general public is misled.\n\n\"They would understand a 100-year flood only happens once every 100 years,\" he said. \"That's a problem because statistics don't work that way.\"\n\nSuch flood events don't literally return only once every century. Rather, computer models estimate that such an event has a 1% chance of occurring at any given spot in a year. What happened in previous years doesn't change those odds.\n\nFurthermore, Berg said, these estimated probabilities are \"to some extent meaningless\" where records go back barely 100 years. They are meant for purposes of development planning, not weather forecasting. The likelihood of storms across centuries isn't known. Neither is when the 500-year floodplain of the Guadalupe River may fill up again. Two things are certain, though: It will fill again and the chances are increasing.\n\nThe warming climate is making precipitation more intense in Texas and beyond. A similar amount of rain falls in fewer, more concentrated storms than it used to, according to a 2024 report from the Office of the Texas State Climatologist at Texas A&M University.\n\n\"Many studies have documented an increase in extreme rainfall in Texas and surrounding areas,\" the report said. \"Extreme rainfall is strongly affected by increased temperatures.\"\n\nIn Texas, as elsewhere on the planet, all 10 of the warmest years on record have occurred since 2011. Warming is a result of the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, released in large part by burning fossil fuels like the oil in the tanks sitting in the floodplains across the Eagle Ford Shale. And warmer air can hold more water vapor, leading to heavier downpours.\n\nIf global fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions continue to climb, so will extreme rainfall.\n\n\"Extreme precipitation is expected to increase in intensity on average statewide,\" the state climatologist's report said. \"We anticipate an additional increase of about 10% in expected extreme rainfall intensity in 2036 compared to 2001-2020 and an overall increase of over 20% compared to 1950-1999.\"\n\nThose changes in rainfall intensity correspond to a 50% increase in the likelihood of extreme precipitation compared to 2001-2020, the report said, and a 100% increase compared to 1950-1999.\n\nHowever, heavy rains alone don't always make a mega-flood. They have to fall on just the right areas, across multiple tributaries of a single river so that their waters all converge at once downstream.\n\nIf a 500-year flood returns to the Eagle Ford Shale, it's hard to tell how much oil, wastewater and other petroleum fluids could spill. Conventional oil field tanks range from 210 to 750 barrels in size, or from 13,000 to 32,000 gallons. Typical tank batteries in the Eagle Ford often include five 500-barrel oil tanks and one 500-barrel wastewater tank, according to an investor presentation by Baytex Energy. Some are out of use or empty, some are full, most are in between.\n\nWhatever fluids wash down the river would flow into San Antonio Bay, part of the winter grounds for the world's last flock of wild, endangered whooping cranes, then into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\"With a flood, it causes a lot more dispersion. It breaks it up then you've got oil mixed with sediment and debris. It can stink and it's much, much harder to clean up,\" said Diane Wilson, founder of San Antonio Bay Estuarine Waterkeeper and a 77-year-old former shrimper who lives near the mouth of the Guadalupe River. \"It would be unbelievable, the damage it could do.\"\n\nLast summer, Dubose said, she thought it was about to happen. As soon as she saw the news late at night on the Fourth of July, she rushed out and sped her white Hummer down ranch roads to the river.\n\nIncredible rainfall was hitting the Guadalupe about 150 miles upstream in the Hill Country. Online posts said the water had washed away a summer camp for girls.\n\nDubose had flashbacks to 1998, when there were also overnight rainstorms far upriver that put this region underwater for a week. So she hurried to save a mobile home parked at her fishing camp by the river, the same spot where she'd lost a mobile home in 1998.\n\nAlmost there, she passed nervously between the towering, three-story tank batteries in the floodplain on her land, then past the site of the buried waste where, she said, the grass dies each time heavy rains bring the water table to the surface.\n\nLuckily for Dubose, no torrent came downriver. For Kerrville, in the Hill Country, it was the worst flood since 1987. But all the heavy rain fell upstream of a major dam and reservoir, where water levels were low enough to absorb it. So the Eagle Ford Shale was spared, for now.\n\n\"What happened in Kerrville, if that happens here, that's a really bad situation,\" Dubose said. \"We've told the oil field, this is going to flood someday.\"\n\nThis report is published in partnership with Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, independent news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment.\n\nThis article originally published at ‘Disaster waiting to happen': Fracking boom put hundreds of tanks in Guadalupe River floodplain.",

    "description": "Christina Mann is hauling five-gallon jugs of water from a friend's house because her monthly utility bill has spiked like crazy. And she's not the only American being squeezed.",
    "fullText": "Christina Mann moved from Cleveland, Texas, to the small community of Point Blank four years ago when she retired. She wanted to retire close to the water, a dream of hers. Now, water is the nightmare that's keeping her from making ends meet.\n\nEvery other day, Mann drives several miles to a friend's house to fill five-gallon jugs from a garden hose. That water is what she uses to wash dishes, wash her hands and flush her toilets — her only supply after she decided last November to disconnect her water service entirely.\n\n\"I choose to eat, and I told them that every time you go up, that takes out of my money a month for my food,\" Mann told ABC13's 13 Investigates (1).\n\nMann lives alone on a monthly Social Security check she budgeted carefully around when she retired. There was enough to cover her bills, but barely. When the base fees charged by her provider — a for-profit company called Texas Water Utilities — kept climbing, she felt cornered. A termination notice arrived, and she didn't fight it. \"You don't need to send me one. Just come cut my water off. I can't afford it,\" she said.\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nI’m approaching retirement with no savings. Should I panic? Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nAccording to a copy of Mann's bill reviewed by 13 Investigates, she was charged $169 for a month in which she used just 2,000 gallons. In July, the fees alone — base charges for water and sewage, pass-through fees and a state fee — totaled $150.18. Her actual water and sewage usage that billing cycle came to $9.34.\n\nThat means roughly 94% of her bill had nothing to do with how much water came out of her faucet.\n\nMann said she could manage if her bill were closer to the roughly $60 a month she paid back in Cleveland.\n\nMann's provider, Texas Water Utilities, is an investor-owned utility — a for-profit company, not a city-run system. Texas Water Utilities serves about 60,000 customers in 32 counties, is acquiring at least four other companies, and has filed to tack on a $34-per-month \"system improvement charge\" to recoup more than $80 million in infrastructure spending.",

    "description": "Touring Liberty Tiny Village, a tiny home village for older people, left me wondering what matters more in old age: extra space or a built-in community.",
    "fullText": "When I arrived at Liberty Tiny Village on a warmer than usual day in November, I thought I knew exactly what to expect.\n\nThe resort-style, 55-and-older tiny home community in Aubrey, Texas, markets itself as an upscale community for retirees or soon-to-be retirees ready to shed decades of belongings in exchange for a smaller, freer way of living.\n\nBut that's only part of the story.\n\nThat afternoon, I sat with two neighbors, widows Debbie Giamalva a retired intensive care nurse, and Sherry Miller, a retired English teacher. They told me that what they'd really found at Liberty wasn't just a smaller and more manageable home, but a caring group of friends who look out for one another.\n\nIt left me thinking about how much community matters as you age, especially when the house is quieter — when your partner is gone, and your children have lives of their own. In the moments that count, who do you turn to?\n\nLike many Texas cities and suburbs, Aubrey has been growing as people from nearby areas and high-cost states like California and New York move there seeking more affordable homes, lower taxes, and a lower overall cost of living.\n\nThose newcomers have fueled demand for every kind of housing, from apartment complexes and single-family homes to smaller, more affordable options like Liberty's tiny homes.\n\nLiberty Tiny Village was founded in 2022 and is owned by Melissa Hayes and her husband, Phillip. So far, it has 11 occupied lots.\n\nLiberty is one of several tiny-home communities that have sprung up across North Texas over the past decade, but it comes with a major perk: Because the homes are classified as recreational and can be moved, residents don't pay property taxes on them.\n\nThe village's homes are small — under 400 square feet — but not cheap; each costs between $75,000 and $160,000. Still, that's far less than the going rate in Aubrey, where Zillow put the median home-sale price at $303,550 and typical rent at $2,267 in December.\n\nKristene Newton, the village's tiny home designer, told me that most residents buy their homes outright. After that, their main monthly expense is $950 in lot rent, which covers water, sewer, trash, landscaping, and WiFi. For residents living on a mix of savings, investments, and Social Security, that kind of low and predictable bill can feel like a game changer.\n\n\"The senior community can get into one of these homes, pay for the home, and the lot rent is going to be cheaper than moving into an apartment—or sometimes even assisted living,\" Newton said.\n\nShe added that she's been shocked to see people sell million-dollar houses to get into the village's tiny homes.\n\nHayes and Newton pitch Liberty as a luxury tiny-home village. And unlike many communities I've visited around DFW, I have to agree — Liberty's homes look and feel deliberately upscale.\n\nEach of the village's homes has one to two bedrooms and one to one-and-a-half bathrooms. The primary bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, and living area are always on the first floor — a design choice that makes sense for a 55+ community.\n\nHayes told me the homes typically have stairs up to the elevated entry, but owners can add a ramp.\n\n\"Even if they want to add it at the very beginning, or decide later as they get older, they can add it,\" she said.\n\nI wanted to get inside the tiny homes to see how they actually feel — and, honestly, to see whether I could picture myself living in one.\n\nWhat surprised me most was how upscale Liberty's tiny homes looked: high ceilings, granite countertops, gleaming gold or silver faucets, chandeliers, hardwood floors, and even electric fireplaces.\n\nThe living rooms and bedrooms felt about as big as some of my first apartments right out of college — just not nearly as well decorated.\n\nThis closet is definitely bigger than the one I had in college, but I still don't think all the things I've collected since then would fit in here.\n\nI toured about five different model homes. Two of the kitchens stood out, but my favorite was the one on the right, with darker cabinetry and appliances.\n\nI've been in hotel rooms with smaller bathrooms. I think this is a pretty decent size for a tiny home.\n\nI'm 5'10\", so tall ceilings are a must. I was shocked by how spacious the two-story models felt — I couldn't believe the entire tiny home fit into just 399 square feet.\n\nIf you're willing to pay extra, many floor plans also include a loft for storage or an extra sleeping spot.\n\nI have a bunch of younger cousins. I can totally picture one of them turning this loft space into a fort.\n\nBoth women came to Liberty for a similar reason — living alone in large homes had started to feel less like freedom and more like a liability.\n\n\"My husband passed away in 2021,\" Giamalva, 70, told me. \"What did I need with a second bedroom? I also didn't need a 900-square-foot apartment.\"\n\nGiamalva paid for her tiny home in full using the money she made from selling her previous house. With her highest fixed cost now the $950 monthly lot rent, she said moving to the village was a \"no-brainer.\"\n\nMiller arrived at a similar conclusion. She'd been living in a 2,200-square-foot house with a pool, but with her son miles away at Texas A&M, she said it no longer made sense to stay there.\n\nMiller told me that moving into a tiny home solved her problems. \"I sold my house, and I didn't owe anything; I didn't have a mortgage, so I was able to take that money, buy this, and have enough left to hopefully last me the rest of my life,\" she said.\n\n\"If something happened to you in your place, everybody would know if they didn't see you,\" Giamalva said.\n\nMiller, who told me she has health issues, echoed that sentiment.\n\n\"Not to be morbid, but when you get to be a certain age, and you're living alone, you think, 'If I fell — if, God forbid, something happened to me—nobody would know. Here, we just watch out for each other.\"\n\nAt Liberty, management plans monthly events — Thanksgiving dinners, for example, and most recently a chili cook-off. Residents also meet for Bible study and, when they can, walk their dogs together.\n\nThey even have a community group chat. \"We have a good chat going,\" Miller said. \"If you needed something, all you would need to do is put it on there — and I know somebody would help.\"\n\nFor me, that sounds like the main draw: the independence of having your own place, with the comfort of knowing you're not entirely on your own.\n\nGiamalva and Miller said they wouldn't get that same mix in an assisted-living facility or retirement home, where costs are higher, and it can be harder to build relationships — or even just get around.\n\n\"As you get older and retire, your body ages, but inside, we still feel young,\" Miller said. \"So I don't want to go to some home or an apartment for old people.\"\n\nFor many of Liberty's residents, living alone must feel liberating, especially in old age, when doing so is often treated as risky or even discouraged.\n\nIt must also feel empowering. Giamalva and Miller chose to give up their bigger lives for something smaller, a move that's both brave and practical.\n\nI'm still young and newly married, so I haven't spent much time thinking about what I'd do in their position — until now.\n\nLeaving the village, I kept turning these questions over: If I ever found myself in a similar chapter, would I make the same choice? And would the promise of community make it easier to give up extra space and the things I'd accumulated over a lifetime?",

    "fullText": "Jasmine Crockett's most-watched TikTok clip is a five-second interview outside the U.S. Capitol. Someone asks the Democratic congresswoman from Texas what she would tell billionaire Elon Musk, and Crockett replies with a vulgar, two-word phrase. It’s been viewed 20.7 million times.\n\nJames Talarico’s top TikTok video is 88 seconds from a speech in which the Texas state representative says billionaires, not minorities, are destroying America, adding that “the biggest division in our politics is not left versus right, it's top versus bottom.” It’s been watched 15.5 million times.\n\nThe two are facing off in the party's U.S. Senate primary March 3, showcasing divergent approaches to harvesting a modern politician's most precious resource — attention.\n\nCrockett feuds with President Donald Trump and other Republicans. Talarico calls himself a policy wonk and quotes the Bible.\n\nWhomever Democrats nominate will say a lot about what they see as their best strategy for breaking the Republican hold on the state and helping their long-shot effort to recapture the Senate majority.\n\n“I think their voting records would be identical, but their style of politics is very different, which is fascinating to watch,” said Allison Campolo, Democratic Party chair for Fort Worth's home county.\n\nSocial media has pitfalls, though. A TikTok influencer posted this week that Talarico referred to former U.S. Rep. Colin Allred of Texas, the Democrats' unsuccessful 2024 Senate nominee, as “mediocre,” creating a tempest. Talarico is white; the influencer, Allred and Crockett are Black.\n\nTalarico put out a statement calling it a “mischaracterization” of a private conversation.\n\nDemocrats are bullish again about their chances\n\nDemocrats haven't won a Senate race in Texas since 1988, but they see an opening this year. Republicans might not renominate four-term Sen. John Cornyn and might opt for state Attorney General Ken Paxton, who's popular with Trump's base but has also spent most of his career under legal troubles. Rep. Wesley Hunt also is seeking the GOP nomination.\n\nDemocrats' success in elections since Trump began his second term — including a special election for the Texas state Senate last month — has buoyed the party’s hopes that, after decades of losses in statewide races, this may be their year.\n\nCrockett, 44, a former public defender and civil-rights attorney, served two years in the Texas House before winning her congressional seat in the Dallas area in 2022. Her supporters see her as the candidate better able to excite voters of color, who've been a key part of the Democratic base.\n\nTalarico, 36, is training to be a Presbyterian minister. A former middle school teacher, he first won his Austin-area legislative seat in 2018. His backers believe the discussion of his Christian faith could win over a wider swath of voters this fall.\n\nBoth are adept at creating digital moments — and followings.\n\nCrockett has 2.2 million TikTok followers, giving her one of the largest reaches on the platform among members of Congress. By comparison, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York has 4.1 million followers.\n\nCrockett's most popular posts include audio of Trump insulting her as she remains expressionless until flashing a smile at the end, in a video her campaign posted with the hashtag #TexasTough. Another clip, viewed 2 million times, is her simply lip-syncing to the 1990s rock hit “What's Up?” by 4 Non Blondes along with a Democratic candidate in Michigan.\n\nBut clips from combative exchanges in Congress are what accelerated Crockett's ascent into one of the party's rising young stars. In one May 2024 clash with then-Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican suggested during a hearing that Crockett’s “fake eyelashes” got in the way of reading legislation. Crockett snaps back with her own put-down, suggesting that Greene had a “bleach-blonde, bad-built butch body.”\n\nCrockett has said her training as a trial lawyer allows her to answer Republicans in the moment, but her remarks that take off on social media have also brought blowback. After a video of her calling Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who uses a wheelchair, “Governor Hot Wheels” went viral, Crockett responded by saying she was referring to Abbott using transportation to send migrants from Texas to U.S. cities.\n\nCrockett acknowledged during her only debate so far with Talarico that she is “not about politics as usual.”\n\n“I think that I will do the edgy things, the things that the political consultants will never tell you to do,” Crockett said.\n\nTalarico, who has 1.5 million TikTok followers, said Democrats cannot win the Texas seat “with the same old politics of division.”\n\nOn social media, Talarico leans into his background as a seminarian. Clips show him asking pointed questions in legislative debates, opposing school vouchers or a requirement that teachers post the Ten Commandments in their classrooms. In one video, Talarico notes lawmakers are working on the Sabbath to pass the Ten Commandments bill, a violation of one of those commandments.\n\n“Maybe they should try following the Ten Commandments before mandating them,” he wrote alongside the post.\n\nTalarico regularly talks about Jesus’ command for people to love others as they love themselves. He's done long podcast interviews, including with Joe Rogan, the popular podcaster who endorsed Trump in 2024 after the Republican sat down for an interview. Rogan told Talarico near the end of their 2 1/2-hour podcast last summer that he should run for president.\n\nDigital strategies get attention — and help fundraise\n\nPlatforms like X, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok also help candidates raise money and test messaging.\n\n“You can communicate as often as you want at the times that you prefer and you can vary the format,” said Pinar Yildirim, an associate professor of marketing and economics at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business.\n\nCandidates tie social media content to online ads to test which messages most effectively bring potential supporters to their websites, said Jennifer Stromer-Galley, a professor of information studies at Syracuse University.\n\n“Now they can do it in much more fine-grained, real-time ways,” said Stromer-Galley, who wrote a book on the history of presidential candidates’ online campaign efforts.\n\nSocial media also bridges the distance between Senate candidates and the national donor base they need to tap, said Mike Doyle, the Democratic chair for Austin’s home county.\n\nCrockett raised about $642,000 during the first week of her campaign and has collected $6.5 million so far, most of it carried over from her House account. Talarico raised more than $1.2 million in his campaign's first week, on his way to more than $13 million in contributions so far.\n\n“You don't have to be on the ground to see Jasmine or James on social media,” Doyle said.",

Angelo State scored six runs in the bottom of the fourth inning en route to an early 8-1 lead. ASU added an additional run in the bottom of the sixth inning, which proved to be the game’s final play.

    "description": "\"It's like a technology monastery thing,\" Musk said about SpaceX's Starbase campus. \"Remote and mostly dudes.\"",
    "fullText": "SpaceX and Tesla both began in California before relocating their headquarters to Texas — a move Elon Musk has said created a hiring challenge.\n\nMusk, the CEO of both companies, said married technicians, engineers, and scientists have struggled to bring their families to certain parts of the state. The problem is most acute at SpaceX's south Texas launch site and headquarters, known as Starbase.\n\n\"I call it the 'significant other' problem,\" Musk said during a nearly three-hour interview with tech podcaster Dwarkesh Patel and Stripe's cofounder John Collison that was posted on Thursday. \"For Starbase, that was particularly difficult, since the odds of finding a non-SpaceX job are pretty low.\"\n\nStarbase — where SpaceX has built and tested its rockets since 2019 — is situated in a sparsely populated area of Texas, close to the US‑Mexico border. It's located across from the largely undeveloped Las Palomas Wildlife Management Area.\n\nThe campus is roughly a 40‑minute drive from Brownsville, the nearest city, according to Google Maps. Brownsville has a population of around 187,000, based on the most recent US Census data.\n\nThat remoteness marks a sharp contrast with SpaceX's former headquarters in El Segundo, California, which is minutes from Los Angeles and part of one of the country's largest job markets.\n\n\"It's like a technology monastery thing,\" Musk said about Starbase. \n\"Remote and mostly dudes.\"\n\nTesla, which moved its headquarters from California to Austin in 2021, faces a similar — though less severe — challenge, Musk said.\n\nThe automaker's campus, called Giga Texas, is a roughly 30-minute drive from downtown Austin, where nearly 1 million people live. Plus, while Tesla's top executives have largely moved to Texas, the electric car company still maintains several robotics, energy, and manufacturing operations in California.\n\n\"Tesla being engineering, especially being primarily in Silicon Valley, it's easier for people to just... They don't have to change their life very much. Their commutes are going to be the same,\" he said. \"Tesla still has a majority of its engineering in California.\"\n\nMusk, who has predicted Austin will be \"the biggest boomtown that America has seen in 50 years,\" has made moves to build out his company campuses, including a company town called \"Snailbrook\" near The Boring Company and SpaceX.",

    "description": "The Texas Longhorns evened up their SEC record at 5-5 with a win over South Carolina but their slow starts are still a problem area that Sean Miller must fix.",
    "fullText": "The 2025-26 Texas men's basketball team will never make it look easy.\n\nMost every game is a scrap, opponent's record be damned.\n\nAnd so it went Tuesday against South Carolina at sleepy Moody Center.\n\nThe Longhorns are smart enough to realize they can’t look past anybody, yet they were locked in the middle of a cockfight at crunch time against a team with nothing to lose. SC, now 2-8 in SEC play, isn’t a good team but a visitor from another planet would not have been able to pick which team was favored by 13 points at certain points.\n\nMORE CED: Why Texas baseball's Schlossnagle sought roster depth in the offseason\n\nThe 84-75 win had to happen at this point in the season lest the Horns were about to start wondering if they would accept the predictable NIT invitation in a couple of months.\n\n  It's called Ced’s Corner, from the mind of the American-Statesman’s resident sports columnist, the 2025 NSMA Texas Sportswriter of the Year.\n\nAs it turns out, they shook off a comatose start in front of a late-arriving crowd for the early tipoff — the student section at Moody was noticeably thin — survived 35 points from South Carolina guard Meechie Johnson and blistered the Gamecocks with 49 second-half points to win a game much closer than the final score indicated.\n\nAnd all of a sudden, the Horns, after an 0-2 start in conference play, are firmly in the NCAA Tournament mix. They’re 13-9 overall and 5-5 in the league which puts them only one win from matching last season’s conference total, though it’s obvious the SEC isn’t as strong as the 2025 group that sent 14 teams to the NCAAs.\n\nWith beatable Ole Miss coming to town Saturday and Chris Beard coming off an 84-66 beatdown courtesy of fellow former Longhorn coach Rick Barnes’ Tennessee team, there is a chance to stack a third straight win.\n\nThe Horns avoided a fate similar to what happened to the football team after it lost to a bad Florida team, effectively crippling its chances to make the College Football Playoff. In basketball’s case, they figured it out thanks to a couple of second-half 3-pointers from Cam Heide, who has emerged as a needed source of offense of late; 15 second-half points from veteran guard Tramon Mark and another 20 from All-SEC candidate Dailyn Swain.\n\nWith football coach Steve Sarkisian and baseball coach Jim Schlossnagle seated together courtside, the Horns pulled it together in front of 10,286 who rose to their feet, some of them for the first time all evening.\n\nMORE HORNS: Texas athletics lost money in 2025\n\nOne question can apply to both the fans and the team they were watching. Where was the energy?\n\nWe understand that a 6 p.m. start and Austin traffic aren’t made for one another but the fans who were there for the tip didn’t bring a whole lot of energy to a team that has a recent history of slow starts. The Horns missed seven of their first eight shots and didn’t reach double digits until the 11-minute, 14-second mark of the first half.\n\n“The message is to keep being aggressive,” Heide said. “You’ve got to go in there and set the tone. If we do that, it’s really going to help.”\n\nMORE CED: Where Texas football landed on the Ceddy Awards\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, the crowd will help too.\n\nAt one point of the second half with the game still in the balance, coach Sean Miller raised his arms to the fans, asking them to give his team some energy. If we’re being honest, the crowd was as lethargic as the guys playing even if the result turned out in Texas’ favor.\n\n“The one thing about the crowd is you have to give them something to cheer about,” Miller said. “It’s not one-sided. They're coming here. They're sacrificing. They're coming to watch Texas. They want us to win. They want to see a great game. And you’ve got to be locked in.”\n\nTexas players, coming off a big win at Oklahoma, weren't locked in for large parts of the game, particularly point guard Jordan Pope who suffered through a 26-minute nightmare.\n\nOne of the most experienced guards in the college game missed five of his six field goal attempts and finished with no assists. He went without a field goal for the first 34-plus minutes. When asked if he would consider moving Pope to the wing, Miller said “I think we’ve got him at the right spot. He told me he was a point guard.”\n\nIt’s an understatement to say Texas plays to the competition because the Horns are good enough to give a good team like Auburn a tussle and shaky enough to be locked in a 50-50 wrestling match with the No. 15 team in the 16-team SEC.\n\nThey’re never going to be a shutdown defense as evidenced by the No. 96 defensive ranking per kenpom.com will attest. More important was a move up to No. 33 in Ken's NCAA NET ratings, seventh among SEC teams.\n\nSeven-foot sophomore post Matas Vokietaitis is going through some growing pains on both ends. He continues to commit careless fouls on defense and continues to get stripped by smaller players because he brings the ball down in traffic despite being only three feet from the bucket. He is second on the team with 53 turnovers, a huge number for the position. Worse yet, he missed more point-blank looks than his coaches care to count.\n\nLooking ahead, the Horns are in play to make a realistic run at the Big Dance but they can’t afford to give away winnable games. Ole Miss, at 11-11 overall and 3-6 in the SEC, represents a nice chance to move over .500 after 11 games for the first time since Rodney Terry took over the 2023 team after Beard’s firing. Texas started 8-3 and advanced to the Elite Eight with a win over Miller’s Xavier team that season.\n\nLots has changed since then and if you ask Miller, more change is needed — particularly on defense.\n\nIf anything, they’re in a good place considering where they started.",

The Angelo State Rams introduced their latest offseason acquisitions Wednesday night in front of an audience of coaches, families and friends at Shenanigan’s Sports Bar in San Angelo. Rams head football coach Jeff Girsch spoke at the gathering, introducing each incoming high school signee by projecting their highlights via Hudl.\n\nThe Rams added 22 high school signees as well as five college transfers. Girsch couldn’t be more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.\n\n“We know they’re going to be good football players [just by] watching their film and seeing that, so that evaluation is pretty easy,” Girsch said. “But getting to know these guys over time and recruiting them [excites us]. We started recruiting some of them back in the summer, and all the way getting through the season and the visit season.”\n\nGirsch isn’t the only coach excited about this incoming class. The Rams’ new offensive coordinator, Jason Johnson, is ready to embrace his new opportunity and is thrilled to work with athletes showing vast versatility.\n\n“I’m really excited about the athleticism because they bring so much versatility to what we do from that standpoint,” Johnson said. “We can use [the players] in different places, not just on offense and defense, but also in our special teams units.”",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M (17-4, 7-1 SEC) is currently taking on Alabama for a midweek road trip, looking to reach 8-1 in conference play, and stay atop the conference standings before hosting Florida on Saturday afternoon.\n\nFirst-year head coach Bucky McMillan has led the Aggies to their second-best start in SEC play since joining the conference before the 2012 season, and wouldn't be anywhere this season without Spanish sharpshooter Rubén Dominguez, who is averaging 12.9 points per game, 2.4 rebounds, 1.5 assist, and averaging 44.9% from the field, 43.4% frome three-point, and 89.6% from the free throw line.\n\nOne of the best three-point shooters in the country, Dominguez is expected to remain a key part of McMillan's future rosters with two years of eligibility, and in the new age of college basketball, landing international players during the transfer portal period has become a popular trend, and will continue, especially in the SEC.\n\nDuring Dominguez's transition to Texas A&M, McMillan and his staff encountered no issues beyond travel, which took longer than for the other 14 new additions to the roster.\n\nHowever, the drama surrounding former NBA G-League center Charles Bediako, who returned to Alabama late last month, is currently playing vs. Texas A&M, but will be back in court after receiving a temporary restraining order by Judge James Roberts, who has since recused himself from the case.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bediako’s attorneys reportedly sent the NCAA a list of admissions regarding the eligibility of international professional basketball players, including Texas A&M star Rubén Dominguez. Within the document provided by Bama247 writer Mike Rodak, Bediako's legal team listed the Texas A&M sophomore as the 38th example of an international player who was granted eligibility.\n\n\"Admit that you have granted eligibility to Ruben Dominguez, a current student-athlete at Texas A&M University and former member of Movistar Estudiantes from Spain.\"\n\nAlabama is currently 14-7 and 4-4 in SEC play before the conclusion of Wednesday's, and if Bediako isn't granted an eligibility extension, the Crimson Tide will be lacking size in the front court.\n\nBediako’s attorneys sent the NCAA a list of admissions regarding the eligibility of international professional basketball players. pic.twitter.com/Uheimc2BXq\n\n— Mike Rodak (@mikerodak) February 4, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Rubén Dominguez is named in Charles Bediako's eligibility dispute",

    "fullText": "The grieving parents of a Texas girl who drowned during a scuba certification class have filed a lawsuit against two agencies alleging the child’s death was preventable.\n\nOn Aug. 16, 2025, 12-year-old Dylan Harrison attended a private open water class purchased by her parents from Scubatoys, a local dive-shop, according to FOX 4.\n\nWhen the family reportedly arrived at The Scuba Ranch, a scuba training take located in nearby Terrell, they were told their daughter would be placed in a group of seven students.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges the divemaster assured Dylan’s parents ahead of the class, telling them, \"I will not take my eyes off your daughter.\"\n\nCollege Freshman Died After Fraternity Hazing Led To 'Horrific' Abuse, Family Says\n\nAt the time of the class, Assistant Chief Deputy for the Collin County Sheriff’s Office William Armstrong was employed part-time as a scuba instructor, and had previously worked a full day as a deputy followed by a full overnight shift as a security officer at an investment firm, FOX 4 reported.\n\nAs Dylan and her 12-year-old swimming buddy entered the water, Armstrong allegedly did not check if Dylan was properly weighted, the lawsuit reportedly states.\n\nDylan was last seen alive when the class initially entered the water at 9:36 a.m. and resurfaced at 10:12 a.m. after a miscommunication with a student.\n\nCruise Ship Chaos Mounts As Deaths, Crimes On Board Shatter Illusions Of Safety At Sea, Experts Warn\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that emergency services were not called to the scene until about 15 minutes later.\n\n\"Based on the amount of air left in [Dylan’s] scuba tank on the surface before she went missing and the amount of air left in the tank when she was found, it can be surmised that [she] was alive and breathing off her tank for several minutes after she was last seen,\" the lawsuit revealed, according to FOX 4. \"During this time, [Dylan] was alone, in poor visibility, and unable to reach the surface.\"\n\nFollowing the incident, Armstrong resigned from his position with the Collin County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nFamily Of Brianna Aguilera Sues Over Alcohol Service Ahead Of Death\n\nThe 40-page lawsuit alleges Dylan’s death was preventable and the result of multiple failures after the industry turned a blind eye to safety concerns for several years.\n\nAttorneys for the Harrison family reportedly point to a 2017 video of a staff meeting, in which Scubatoy owner Joe Johnson allegedly made dismissive comments about the safety protocols within the company’s classes, FOX 4 reported.\n\n\"All I know is we've killed, what? 4 people? 5 people? And we've never even done a deposition,\"  Johnson said in the video. \"Our insurance company just settles. John Witherspoon says we can kill two people a year and ‘we are fine.’\"\n\nScubatoys, NAUI, PADI, the Scuba Ranch and the Harrison family’s attorney did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment. Fox News Digital was unable to immediately locate an attorney representing Armstrong.\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M will open the 2026 baseball season next Friday night against Tennessee Tech, as second-year head coach Michael Early will look to rebound after his inaugural campaign took a massive dive during the latter part of the 2025 regular season, including SEC bottom-dweller Missouri sweeping the Aggies at home in dramatic fashion.\n\nJust months after the 2025 season came to an end, Earley went to work to retain key players on the roster, and while NIL deals likely played a big role, star hitters Caden Sorrell, Gavin Grahovac, and standout freshman Terrence Kiel will all return, combined with elite transfer addition Chris Hacopian, who previously starred for the Maryland Terrapins.\n\nHowever, the injury bug struck once again after it was announced that sophomore LHP Caden McCoy would miss the regular season, leaving another gaping hole on the mound, and while Shane Sdao and Weston Moss look like the No. 1 and 2 options, Texas A&M pitching coach Dylan Olsonawski will have his work cut out for him as soon as the season begins.\n\nWhile the season is a little over a week away, it was announced on Tuesday night that the Aggies will hold an open scrimmage on Saturday afternoon at Blue Bell Park, beginning at 1 p.m. Provided by GigEm247 beat writer Carter Karels, here are the details for the event.\n\nTexas A&M baseball will hold an open scrimmage at Blue Bell Park this Saturday, beginning at 1 p.m. Details below: pic.twitter.com/FIuIcVv5D0\n\n— Carter Karels (@CarterKarels) February 4, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M baseball will hold an open scrimmage on Saturday at 1 p.m.",

    "fullText": "The way of the college football world today breaks down to this: coaches don’t get many opportunities to screw up, and anything short of a national championship is considered a screw up. So, given that current logic, it’s no surprise that the Houston Chronicle recently published a column noting that Texas head coach Steve Sarkisian sits atop a steadily warming hot-ish seat after the Longhorns missed the College Football Playoff last season.\n\nFrom the Chronicle: “Steve Sarkisian is not on any hot seat by a long shot. Not after going 35-8 the past three years (with two of the losses in the College Football Playoff semifinals and three other losses to Georgia and, oh yeah, Florida). He reached the CFP two of the previous three seasons and barely missed this past season. But he’s on the warming seat. And he’s got company. Sarkisian is preparing for his sixth season at Texas after seeing 26 of his players transfer out and 19 transfer in, including the portal’s top-ranked wide receiver, two outstanding running backs and two elite linebackers. The big number of those leaving suggest Texas badly missed its evaluations on more than two dozen players or drastically upgraded all of those positions. Actually, both of those premises could be true. Sarkisian at least grasps the sense of urgency among Longhorn Nation because this isn’t a place where you want to miss the playoff two years in a row. But he’s not alone. I’d say the top five coaches with the most heat on them, in order, are Alabama’s Kalen DeBoer, Oregon’s Dan Lanning, Sarkisian, LSU’s Lane Kiffin and USC’s Lincoln Riley. None of these obviously are in a must-win situation like some others. … Those on the hottest of hot seats are Baylor’s Dave Aranda (three losing seasons in the past four years), Florida State’s Mike Norvell (coming off 2-10 and 5-7 seasons), Wisconsin’s Luke Fickell (16-21 over three years), Maryland’s Mike Locksley (1-8 in Big Ten two straight years) and South Carolina’s Shane “Did you see our first half against the Aggies?” Beamer. … Of the group needing to break through and avoid slipping backward, they just need to win big and dispel the notion that they have hit a wall and have to get past it. DeBoer, it says here, is the best coach in the nation not named Kirby Smart, Curt Cignetti or Ryan Day, yet a large percentage of Crimson Tide fans think his days might be numbered if a third year isn’t more successful after missing the CFP in Year 1 and winning one CFP game over an average Oklahoma team in Year 2. Lanning has been a borderline disaster in the CFP, getting squashed by Ohio State in 2024 and mauled by Indiana in 2025 (after dominating Texas Tech). Kiffin may or may not have a honeymoon in his first season at Baton Rouge, but he’s still not been on the sidelines for a CFP game yet in his career. Riley can sure develop a quarterback or two with Caleb Williams and Jayden Maiava, but when is the breakthrough season coming?

    "fullText": "Texas A&M (17-4, 7-1 SEC) still sits atop the SEC standings after defeating Georgia on the road 92-77, and with seven wins in conference play, the Aggies likely need at least three more victories to solidify their NCAA Tournament chances as an at-large bid. Set to face Alabama on the road, the Crimson Tide is desperate to protect home court after falling to Florida on the road 100-77.\n\nEntering Wednesday's road test, first-year head coach Bucky McMillan spent Monday praising his team rather than spending both the pregame press conference and Aggie basketball hour discussing Alabama's roster, especially center Charles Bediako, who will be available on Wednesday amid his ongoing eligibility battle. After shooting 45% from the field and 38% from beyond the arc, the Aggies will need to continue outshooting opponents to keep the win streak alive.\n\nHowever, Alabama has nearly matched Texas A&M from three-point range over the past two games, making an average of 14 threes per game compared to the Aggies' 15.\n\nHealth-wise, outside of Indiana transfer forward Mackenzie Mgbako, McMillan's roster is entirely healthy heading into Wednesday night, and according to the initial injury report, Alabama will be without three players, while forward Taylor Bol Bowen (7.7 PPG, 5.4 RPG), who was injured against Florida, is listed as \"questionable\" with a 50% chance to play.\n\nEven if Bol Bowen doesn't play, Texas A&M will face a healthy Alabama squad led by star guard Labaron Philon Jr., who is averaging 21.6 points per game, shooting 51% from the field, and 38% from beyond the arc.\n\nThe SEC Student-Athlete Availability Report ahead of Texas A&M at Alabama tomorrow night: pic.twitter.com/M8t9COrbYQ\n\n— TexAgs (@TexAgs) February 4, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M is 100% healthy before facing Alabama on Wednesday",

    "fullText": "Arlington (Texas) Mansfield Timberview three-star wide receiver Trysten Shaw announced on Tuesday evening that he has decommitted from UCLA.\n\nShaw was pledged to the Bruins since Aug. 20 and originally stayed locked in despite the departure of head coach DeShaun Foster. He even returned to Westwood over the weekend for a junior day visit and reaffirmed his pledge. He’s now opted to re-open his process between his junior and senior seasons.\n\n“After a long thought and prayer with my family, I have decided to decommit and reopen my recruitment. Thank you UCLA for the opportunity,” Shaw wrote announcing his decision on X.\n\nShaw is the No. 678 overall prospect and No. 94 WR in the 2027 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all major recruiting media companies. He’s also the No. 86 player in Texas.\n\nThe 5-foot-10, 165-pounder currently holds offers from the likes of Ole Miss, Arkansas, Kansas State, Syracuse, Pitt, Kentucky and a slew of others.\n\nShaw leaves new head coach Bob Chesney and the Bruins with just one commit in the 2027 class. On Monday, UCLA landed a commitment from Temecula (Calif.) Chaparral three-star WR Michael Farinas.\n\n“Honestly I love the culture that coach Chesney is bringing to the program,” Farinas told Rivals’ Greg Biggins. “Coach Chesney is a proven winner and I know he’s going to bring that to UCLA.\n\n“Everyone in the program wants to win and that’s something I want to be a part of. They’re building something special so I’m very excited to be a Bruin.”\n\nFarinas may now be the lone pledge in the UCLA class, but the Bruins’ big junior day weekend has them soaring with top recruits that were in attendance. Biggins has all the latest intel coming out of the weekend as Chesney and Co. look to usher in a new era of football in Los Angeles.",

    "description": "The Longhorns hope to take advantage of three of the next four games at home against weaker conference opponents.",
    "fullText": "The Longhorns hope to take advantage of three of the next four games at home against weaker conference opponents.\n\nAt the midway point of SEC play, the Texas Longhorns are firmly on the NCAA Tournament bubble as the last team in the field of Joe Lunardi’s Bracketology after opening a winnable stretch of games with Saturday’s 10-point victory over the Oklahoma Sooners in Norman prior to hosting the South Carolina Gamecocks at the Moody Center on Tuesday.\n\nNext Saturday, disgraced former head coach Chris Beard brings his scuffling Ole Miss team to the Forty Acres, followed by a road game against Missouri and a home matchup against LSU. A win probability of 50 percent for the game in Columbia the lowest of that stretch for the Longhorns, creating an imperative for first-year head coach Sean Miller’s team to at least protect home court at the Moody Center.\n\nEven a win on Tuesday would represent just the second time in conference play that Texas has won back-to-back games and the only winning streak longer than that came early in the season when the Longhorns notched four straight games against some of the worst teams in the country.\n\nBut since the 14-point loss to Tennessee in Knoxville in which Texas struggled to compete, Miller’s team has had chances to win every other game, including in hostile environments like Rupp Arena in Lexington and Neville Arena in Auburn.\n\nAfter taking an eight-point lead into halftime against the Tigers, however, the game got away from the Longhorns in the second half because Texas committed 18 fouls that led to 28 free-throw attempts for Auburn.\n\n“Not a lot else changed, but what really changed is their free-throw attempts,” Miller said in an appearance on On Texas Football. “It’s not eight fouls that we’re trying to get rid of, it’s the two, three, or four undisciplined fouls that we can correct, that we are working hard to correct.”\n\nThose several undisciplined fouls add up quickly in close games — in the four SEC loses outside of the poor effort against the Volunteers, the Longhorns have lost by an average of 4.5 points.\n\n“That’s four free-throw attempts. They didn’t get into bonus as early. There’s a huge swing when you can foul less in college basketball, and I think that’s plagued our defense, and we could be a better overall defensive team. I’ve told our guys on a daily basis, if the number goes in the right direction defensively for us, a lot of the things that we’re hunting and going after will come true, but we’re only going to go as far on this path as our defensive improvement allows us,” Miller said.\n\nTexas currently ranks 297th in opposing free-throw rate.\n\nThe single player Miller needs to make strides in fouling less over the final nine SEC games is sophomore center Matas Vokietaitis, who is averaging 5.2 fouls per 40 minutes.\n\n“He gets fouled as much as any player that plays college basketball, so the spotlight is always on him — that means you have to be even more disciplined and smarter when it’s your turn to defend. There are times to be physical and there’s times to let it go, and there’s times that you have to show your hands and go vertical, and there’s times when you have to do a lot of work with your legs and your chest, your torso, and not your hands. We’ve had a hard time, truth be told, with Matas in that area, but he’s better than he was, for example, when we played in the Maui Invitational,” Miller said.\n\nVokietaitis is also better than he was last year as a freshman at Florida Atlantic in his first season playing basketball in the United States, cutting his fouling by almost a full foul per 40 minutes.\n\nFor the Texas team, however, a worse forced turnover rate than opposing free-throw rate is a bad duo.\n\n“We don’t force turnovers and we foul — that’s a wicked combination. Teams that don’t force turnovers can win big, but you cannot foul,” Miller said on Monday.\n\nThe other area defensively that the Longhorns need to improve in is three-point defense. Texas is limiting opponents to a three-point rate of 35.6 percent, 60th nationally, but allowing opponents to make 35.4 percent of those attempts 258th nationally.\n\nBecause the Horns have a low three-point rate and an even lower assist rate, the degree of difficulty for those three-point attempts is heightened because they often come off the dribble, and the combination of allowing that level of efficiency from opponents and not making up for it in volume can create large margins like the Hoos notching a 24-point edge in points off threes in their 19-point win in December.\n\nBut despite those weaknesses offensively, Miller and his staff have managed to create the most efficient offense at Texas since DJ Augustin and Damion James led the Longhorns to the Elite Eight in 2007-08, an attack built primarily on getting to the free-throw line and scoring in the paint.\n\nAnd it’s not just Vokietaitis buoying those areas of success — junior wing Dailyn Swain has also attempted more than 100 free throws so far this season and taken even more shots around the rim than the big Lithuanian.\n\nOver the last four games, Swain has been sensational, averaging 25.8 points, 7.3 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 2.5 steals while shooting 64.9 percent from the floor, 44.4 percent from three, and 87.5 percent from the free-throw line.\n\nAlready one of the most dangerous players in the country off the bounce, Swain’s ability to shoot threes effectively is a force multiplier for his game, especially in bailing Texas out of poor possessions in late-clock situations.\n\nThe shooting improvement has taken a lot of hard work behind the scenes from Swain, whose high-major interest out of high school in Columbus was limited by his lack of shooting range.\n\n“It wasn’t that he couldn’t shoot or you didn’t like the way his shot looked like, he basically ignored that part of the game. He did it really almost through his entire time in high school,” Miller said.\n\nAfter signing with Xavier, Swain was 4-of-26 shooting from three as a freshman (15.4 percent) before showing some signs of improvement in making seven of his 28 attempts last season (25 percent). In practice, Miller and his staff spent a year and a half forcing the talented wing to shoot open threes, leading to enough improvement that he gained the confidence to take and make them in games — he’s now a 31.7-percent shooter this season and at 35.5 percent in SEC play.\n\nAs an almost 80 percent career shooter from the free-throw line, Swain’s ability to convert those opportunities gave Miller hope that he could eventually add a three-point shot to his game. Now he has, and it’s made him one of the most efficient scorers in the nation’s best basketball conference.\n\nSouth Carolina arrives in Austin with just two SEC wins, coming against LSU on the road and Oklahoma at home, leaving the Gamecocks at 15th in the conference in adjusted efficiency. But as the overtime loss to Mississippi State in the conference opener revealed a month ago, Texas can play poorly enough to lose to anyone, especially if the team is giving up a lot of three-pointers to opposing guards or debilitated by its fouling virus.\n\nSo Miller is emphasizing what the Longhorns need to do to win rather than focusing on the opponent specifically.\n\n“We just have to be at our best. Period. I think it’s like a nameless, faceless league. On your end, your preparation, your readiness, how you attack the game, how you play, you’ve got to be at your best, and the more you can be at your best, the better opportunity you have for success. So the only thing that’s different about this week is we have back-to-back home games. Other than that, I think we have to look at this — this is an SEC team and we all know what that is,” Miller said.\n\nTip is at 6 p.m. Central on SEC Network with Texas boasting an 85-percent win probability, according to Bart Torvik.",

    "description": "With now just a month to go until Election Day, the Democratic primary for US Senate in Texas has become so fraught that a TikToker’s accusations have roiled the race and prompted a major endorsement in the backlash.",
    "fullText": "With now just a month to go until Election Day, the Democratic primary for US Senate in Texas has become so fraught that a TikToker’s accusations have roiled the race and prompted a major endorsement in the backlash.\n\nThe incident started Sunday night when Morgan Thompson posted a video recounting what she says was a comment Texas state Rep. James Talarico made to her in a private conversation in January: that he called his onetime opponent, former US Rep. Colin Allred, a “mediocre Black man.”\n\nTalarico’s campaign released a statement from the candidate on Monday calling Thompson’s claims “a mischaracterization of a private conversation,” going on to explain, “I described Congressman Allred’s method of campaigning as mediocre — but his life and service are not.” Thompson acknowledged that she didn’t have a recording and that they had previously agreed to treat their conversation as off the record.\n\nBut the accusation slammed Talarico’s campaign on Monday, sending aides into a flurry and prompting Allred — who dropped out of the Senate race when Rep. Jasmine Crockett decided to make a last-minute entry — to endorse her in the intense race, despite frustrations he had in December that she had chased him out of the race by getting in. It also renewed the questions about identity politics and electability that have riven the primary and the Democratic Party more broadly.\n\nThompson alleges that Talarico, who is White, said: “I signed up to run against a mediocre Black man, not a formidable, intelligent Black woman.”\n\nTalarico, in his statement denying the exact wording as Thompson relayed it, said, “I understand how my critique of the Congressman’s campaign could be interpreted given this country’s painful legacy of racism, and I care deeply about the impact my words have on others.”\n\nIn an interview on Monday evening, Allred told CNN he felt the campaign’s statement is “an admission that he said what he said,” and expressed surprise that he hadn’t heard from Talarico directly.\n\n“I responded not just on my behalf, but on behalf of Black candidates around the country that even if you run six points ahead of your presidential candidate, you’re still called ‘mediocre,’” Allred said, referring to his results in the 2024 Senate race as compared to Kamala Harris in the state. (Allred outperformed Harris by about five points.)\n\nThompson told CNN that she had been turned on to Talarico’s campaign by a friend last fall and preferred him over Allred. After attending an event of his in Dallas, she started using her social media following to boost him. Talarico’s staff reached out about her video from the rally, she said, and was soon feeding her information like fundraising numbers and clips from his “Jubilee” online debate to help.\n\n“It was like a symbiotic kind of thing. I wasn’t paid by the campaign at all,” Thompson said, though, “I was in constant communication with the campaign.”\n\nThompson said the relationship started to break down after she got a fundraising text for Talarico, signed by the Democratic strategist James Carville, who has been urging Democrats to start moving away from identity politics. Thompson said she saw that as an implicit critique of Black women, and that when she raised her frustrations with the campaign, an aide offered her to have a conversation with Talarico — either on camera for her to post, or “off the record,” as what was meant to be a private conversation.\n\nShe says she opted for the less formal conversation, without a recording. But she says she remembers the exchange, which took place backstage before a town hall in Plano on January 12, very well. Thompson said she raised concerns about the association with Carville and suggested that maybe he was chasing a big name, prompting Talarico to say, “So you’re concerned about me being a sell out?” She said she told him he was overlooking the racial dynamics he’d tipped into, prompting him to say, “I have blind spots.”\n\nCampaign spokesman JT Ennis confirmed the association with Thompson — “the Talarico campaign works with lots of creators in Texas to keep them updated on the campaign,” he said — and that they did speak before the Plano event. But Ennis told CNN Talarico does not recall making either of those statements, and that his version was backed up by an aide whom both said was in the room but was not made available for an interview.\n\nThe conversation turned, Thompson said, when she mentioned to Talarico online chatter she was seeing from people wishing he had run for governor instead — an option he had considered before launching the Senate run and was urged to reconsider when Crockett jumped into the race late.\n\n“That is when he said, ‘I signed up to run against a mediocre black man, not a formidable, intelligent Black woman,’” Thompson said, “That is a direct quote.”\n\nThompson also accused Talarico’s campaign of trying to silence her, claiming that her Instagram account had disappeared and her Threads account had been suspended within minutes of when she posted a video about her claims. Thompson does not know how this would have happened, she acknowledged, given that no one on the campaign has her password, but “It’s just too many factors in play. It’s just too many abnormalities. The timing of it was so fast.”\n\nAs for Thompson’s claims about the social media accounts being closed, Ennis said, “No. We do not have that kind of power, nor would we ever do that.”\n\nShortly after Thompson’s video went viral, Allred posted his own video ripping Talarico.\n\n“Let me just give you some free advice, James,” Allred said. “If you want to compliment Black women, just do it. Just do it. Don’t do it while also tearing down a Black man.”\n\nHe also suggested Talarico, a Presbyterian seminarian, was getting unfair attention for his discussion on the campaign trail of Christianity and how Democrats can make inroads with religious voters.\n\n“We don’t need you,” he said. “You’re not saying anything unique. You’re just saying it looking like you do.”\n\nThe Senate primary is March 3. Allred is also on the ballot that day, in a House primary against Rep. Julie Johnson that he entered after leaving the Senate race.",

    "fullText": "Crunch Fitness is responding to backlash after an immigration-enforcement-related memo from one Texas franchise spread online.\n\nThe gym is the latest national brand caught navigating the immigration flash point — even though the internal document was only meant for a handful of locations.\n\nThe memo, which was leaked in a now-deleted Reddit post last week, was issued by Austin-based Undefeated Tribe Operating Company LLC. The franchisee operates roughly 40 of the company's 500 gyms, according to recent press releases.\n\nIn the memo, the franchise said its policy was to \"cooperate with any law enforcement officer,\" including ICE.\n\nUnder a subsection titled \"what to expect during a raid,\" the franchise told employees that some ICE raids \"can last hours\" and could include searches of \"offices, lockers, or computers\" — all searches that would require a judicial warrant. Staff were instructed to contact management, keep members calm, and tell them \"not to interfere with the agents.\" The franchisee and its owner didn't respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThe guidance quickly sparked criticism online, with dozens of users across TikTok, Instagram, X, and Reddit saying they had canceled their Crunch memberships in protest.\n\nOn Monday, a spokesperson for Crunch told Business Insider the memo \"does not represent Crunch Fitness's corporate policy.\" The spokesperson also said the gym's lobby is the only area law enforcement can access without a warrant.\n\n\"This approach is consistent with Crunch's standards and our long-standing commitment to maintaining welcoming, safe spaces for our members and employees,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Saturday, Crunch Fitness' national social media account distanced itself from the franchise's memo, saying the internal document had been \"misinterpreted.\"\n\nA post shared by Crunch Fitness (@crunchgym)\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with front-end managers and staff at eight Crunch locations across the US. All requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nTwo managers said they had discussed potential ICE scenarios directly with their franchise owners — not with Crunch's corporate office. Front-end staff said they had not received guidance from the national brand, and three employees said they were unsure of any ICE policy as of Monday.\n\nEvery employee interviewed said they had read the leaked memo from the Texas franchise.\n\nOnline reaction has been divided. While several users said they were canceling memberships, others argued that customers were unfairly blaming Crunch's corporate brand for the actions of a single franchise operator.\n\nThe controversy comes amid heightened public scrutiny of corporate relationships with federal immigration enforcement, particularly after two fatal shootings by federal agents in Minneapolis last month.\n\nIn early January, Hilton Hotels faced backlash after one of its Minnesota franchises denied ICE agents access. Hilton removed the location from its system shortly afterward. Rental car giant Enterprise also faced protests after social media users accused the company of providing vehicles to federal agents.\n\nActivists have been calling for a national strike on billion-dollar businesses amid the rising tensions.",

It comes after a Trump-endorsed candidate for the Texas state senate lost to a Democrat over the weekend.",
    "fullText": "A newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch delivered a sharp warning to President Donald Trump after a high-profile Republican loss.\n\nIn a new editorial, The Wall Street Journal warned Trump that a hardline immigration strategy promoted by top aide Stephen Miller is fueling voter backlash.\n\nIt comes after a Trump-endorsed candidate for the Texas state senate lost to a Democrat over the weekend.\n\n“How does a Republican lose by 14 points in a safe conservative Texas state Senate seat that President Trump carried by 17 points in 2024? Answer: When there’s a voter backlash against the Trump Administration, notably its mass deportation debacles,” the Journal wrote, describing the special election in Tarrant County.\n\nDemocrat Taylor Rehmet, a labor union leader and veteran, easily defeated Republican Leigh Wambsganss, who had Trump’s endorsement on Truth Social and vastly outspent her opponent.\n\nRehment is the first Democrat to hold the seat in decades.\n\nThe paper noted the timing was disastrous for Republicans, coming after the high-profile Minneapolis killings by federal immigration agents. “The 31-point vote swing in a little more than 14 months can only be explained as part of a rising tide of opposition to Mr. Trump’s first year and a sour public mood,” the Journal observed.\n\nThe White House has faced mounting national backlash after federal immigration agents fatally shot two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis—Renee Good in early January and Alex Pretti later that month—as part of aggressive enforcement operations in the state.\n\nBoth cases sparked controversy over conflicting official narratives. In Pretti’s case, Homeland Security officials and White House aides initially claimed he approached agents with a gun and posed a threat, while bystander videos show him holding only a cellphone before being pinned down and shot.\n\nSimilarly, authorities initially suggested that Good tried to ram agents with her vehicle before she was fatally shot, a claim contradicted by eyewitness footage and reporting. Critics argue these early statements painted both victims as dangerous to justify the shootings, fueling accusations that the administration misrepresented the events.\n\nThe killings came after Trump deployed thousands of federal immigration agents to Minneapolis as part of an aggressive immigration strategy masterminded by Miller.\n\nMiller’s immigration strategy under Trump has pushed aggressive mass arrests and deportations, with ICE agents pressured to meet high daily quotas, even targeting non-criminal undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal critiqued Miller’s hardline tactics, including a daily quota of 3,000 migrant arrests that it says “was bound to result in agent intrusions into homes and businesses.”\n\nWhile immigration has historically been a winning issue for Republicans, the Journal cautioned that enforcement “that turns ugly in the streets is turning off the swing voters who will determine who wins the race for Congress this year.”\n\nPolls have recently shown Americans turning on Trump and his immigration strategy ahead of the 2026 Midterms. A YouGov poll conducted on January 25 showed that about half (48 percent) of respondents do not think the shooting of Pretti in Minneapolis was justified.\n\nAnother YouGov poll showed that 52 percent of Americans think the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict immigration to the U.S. have gone too far.\n\nAs a result, the paper concluded that even as Trump signals a desire to “dial back the confrontations on the street,” he must also reconsider Miller’s influence. “The Miller strategy isn’t likely to fare better this year,” the editorial warned.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal is not the first Murdoch-owned newspaper to publicly condemn Trump’s immigration strategy.\n\nIn an op-ed published last week, the New York Post argued that the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement in Minneapolis is backfiring politically.\n\n“These enforcement tactics won’t turn the tide, instead they are backfiring,” the Post wrote.",

    "fullText": "The father of a 5-year-old boy who was detained by immigration officers and held at an federal facility in Texas denied government accounts Monday that he abandoned his son as the pair returned to Minnesota.\n\nAdrian Conejo Arias, who is originally from Ecudador, told ABC News that he loves his son, Liam, and would never abandon him, disputing statements from the Department of Homeland Security, which alleged that Arias had left his child in a vehicle. He also said his son got sick while in federal custody but was denied medicine.\n\nAssistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that Arias fled on foot before he was arrested, “abandoning his child.” She said Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers stayed with the boy.\n\n“The facts in this case have NOT changed: The father who was illegally in the country chose to take his child with him to a detention center,\" she said.\n\nMcLaughlin did not address Arias' statement that his son was denied medication while in custody.\n\nArias also said he was arrested unjustly and contended he was in the country legally, with a pending court hearing for asylum.\n\nThe comments come after a federal judge ordered over the weekend that the pair be freed. They were released Sunday and returned to Minnesota, according to Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas.\n\nThe family's arrest and release unfolded during President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration, which has led to daily protests that included the shooting deaths of two American citizens by federal officers. The president last week ordered his top border adviser to oversee the crackdown days after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti, an intensive care nurse at a Veterans Affairs hospital.\n\nBorder czar Tom Homan suggested that mistakes have been made, but he said agents would continue to enforce federal law and called on local and state officials to cooperate with federal officers.\n\nThe boy's detention drew outrage as images of immigration officers surrounding the young boy in a blue bunny hat and Spider-Man backpack began to surface.\n\nMcLaughlin said ICE did not target or arrest the boy, and she repeated assertions that his mother refused to take him after his father’s apprehension. His father told officers he wanted Liam to be with him, she said.\n\nMcLaughlin also said last month that the child was abandoned and that officers tried to get the mother to take custody of the child. “Officers even assured her she would NOT be taken into custody.”\n\nNeighbors and school officials said federal officers used the child as “bait,” telling him to knock on his house’s door so his mother would come out. DHS disputed that description.\n\nMarcos Charles, acting executive associate director of ICE enforcement and removal operations, faulted the father for “abandoning his child in the middle of winter in a vehicle.” He told reporters one officer stayed with the child while others arrested the father.\n\nThe government said the boy’s father entered the U.S. illegally from Ecuador in December 2024. The family’s lawyer said he has a pending asylum claim that allows him to stay in the U.S.\n\nThe vast majority of asylum-seekers are released in the United States, with adults having eligibility for work permits, while their cases wind through a backlogged court system.\n\nEcuadorians, who left in droves in recent years as their country spiraled into violence, have fared poorly in immigration court, with judges granting asylum in 12.5% of decisions in the 12-month period through September, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering and research organization based at Syracuse University.\n\nIn ordering the release of Liam and his father, U.S. District Judge Fred Biery blasted the administration, writing that the case had “its genesis in the ill-conceived and incompetently-implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatizing children.”\n\nThe Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review’s online court docket shows no future hearings for Liam’s father.",

Tied with Tennessee and Kentucky, here are the SEC teams with more than one Quad 1A win.\n\nOver the next four games against Alabama (road), Florida (home), Missouri (road), and Vanderbilt (road), Texas A&M will have three Quad 1A opportunities, and winning one, or two of these tough matchups would likely guarentee the Aggies an at-large bid in the NCAA Tournament, especially given the fact that McMillan's squad is a perfect 12-0 in Quad 3 and Quad 3 games.\n\nAfter Florida blew out Alabama 100-77 on Sunday night, Texas A&M has a chance to take advantage of the Crimson Tide's short turnaround before playing on Wednesday, but needs to play with the same mentality, and shoot at least 45% from the field, and hit free throws to have a chance at pulling off the upset.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M basketball's three Quad 1A wins tied for most in the SEC",

    "fullText": "The president self-soothed by going on a Truth Social posting spree after the Republican Party suffered a major upset in Texas.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, 79, made seven posts in the span of just three minutes on Sunday afternoon and reposted six endorsements he made over the last week after a Democratic candidate secured a decisive victory in Texas’ deep-red 9th State Senate District, which he carried by more than 17 points in 2024.\n\nFirst-time candidate Taylor Rehmet, 33, became the first Democrat to hold the seat in decades after handing a resounding defeat to MAGA activist Leigh Wambsganss, 57 percent to 43 percent.\n\nTrump played nonchalant after the stunning loss in the solidly Republican district by touting the supposed success of his policies.\n\nThe president reposted opinion pieces from the Des Moines Register and Bari Weiss-founded The Free Press titled, “Iowans are earning more, paying less after Trump’s return” and “How Trump Won Davos.”\n\nTrump also published a screenshot of a Jan. 26 X post by Roma Daravi, vice president for public relations of the newly MAGA-fied Kennedy Center, thanking him for “saving America’s cultural center.”\n\nThe president posted another screenshot, this time going all the way back to Dec. 3 last year, of an X post by Texas Democrat Henry Cuellar lavishing praise for Trump’s “tremendous leadership.” At the time, Trump had pardoned Cuellar, who was indicted on a dozen charges, including bribery, conspiracy, and money laundering.\n\nIn another Truth Social post, Trump bragged about receiving a letter dated Feb. 23, 1989, from convicted felon George M. Steinbrenner III, the principal owner and managing partner of the New York Yankees for more than three decades.\n\n“You were great! You tell it like it is,” Steinbrenner wrote. “It is like I said to Stephen, you should run for President some day and get the whole damn thing straightened out.”\n\nIn yet another post, the president daydreamed over a rendering of his planned “Arc de Trump.”\n\nThe president also posted endorsements he had made in races in New Hampshire and Indiana.\n\nIn the case of Texas’ 9th State Senate District, however, Trump’s Truth Social endorsements didn’t carry Wambsganss to victory.\n\nTrump endorsed Wambsganss in three posts made between early Friday morning and Saturday afternoon.\n\n“Today is the day!” Trump wrote on Saturday. “To all Voters in Texas’ 9th State Senate District: GET OUT AND VOTE for a phenomenal Candidate, Leigh Wambsganss. She is a highly successful Entrepreneur, and an incredible supporter of our Movement to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.”\n\nAfter Wambsganss lost, Trump pretended to be blissfully unaware of the election he had made three posts about.\n\n“I don’t know. I didn’t hear about it,” he told reporters in Mar-a-Lago on Sunday.\n\n“I’m not involved in that. That’s a local Texas race. You mean I won by 17 [points], and this person lost?” he said before shrugging. “Things like that happen.”",

Menefee’s win will, at least temporarily, narrow that gap.\n\nSixteen candidates ran to fill the remainder of Turner’s term in the House after he died in March, though none received a majority of votes. Turner, who was first elected to Congress in November 2024 and died last year, had himself succeeded the late Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D), after she died the July prior.\n\nMenefee will serve the remainder of Turner’s term, but will then run again for a full term for the seat in March after the district was redrawn last year.

    "fullText": "Texas A&M (17-4, 7-1 SEC) should be undefeated in SEC play if it weren't for missed free throws down the stretch of the double-overtime loss at Tennessee, as the Aggies have not lost since, and while efficient shooting, paired with improved rebounding have certainly aided the team, resulting in three straight double-digit wins, first-year head coach Bucky McMillan deserve a ton of credit for gearing the focus back to the free throw line.\n\nAs a team, the Aggies are shooting 74.8% from the stripe, while Spanish sharpshooter Ruben Dominguez leads the team at 90%, while six players are shooting 80% or better.\n\nOn Saturday, the Aggies earned their third Quad 1A win after defeating Georgia on the road 92-77, and shot 45% from the field, and 38% from beyond the arc, and outside of winning the rebounding battle 46-39, Texas A&M finished an impressive 19-20 from the free-throw line, and was perfect in the final minutes of the second half.\n\nDuring former head coach Buzz Williams' career in College Station, the Aggies struggled at the free throw line, which directly led to frustrating losses in and out of conference play, and while the offense never flourished under Williams like we've seen under McMillan this season, free throws continued to make or break outcomes for every team, no matter the play style.\n\n\"Bucky Ball\" is built on three-point shooting and high-percentage shots near the rim, while the press defense, comically dubbed the \"mother-in-law\" defense by McMillan, has continued to force turnovers, leading to fast-break points and big leads over the last three games.\n\nStill, in the last three wins, the Aggies were nearly perfect from the free throw line, converting 51-54 attempts for a 94.4% success rate, which, combined with 39 three-pointers, Texas A&M's offense has looked unstoppable, and will continue to score 90 points or more if this success at the stripe continues in conference play.\n\nWhile the size differential is notable over the next two games against Alabama on the road and Florida at home, Texas A&M's fast-paced play style frustrated Auburn and Texas, who both possessed more size in the paint, and if the Aggies continue to convert at the free throw line, anything is possible moving forward.\n\nOver its last three games combined, Texas A&M men's basketball is 51 of 54 (94.4%) from the free throw line.

    "fullText": "The Buffs have remained aggressive in the portal, so here’s a top five you need to know right now. We’ll count down from No. 5 to No. 1 and hit why each addition fits, and how they raise the floor this fall.\n\nLefau is a senior transfer from Texas who comes to Boulder looking to revitalize the Buffs pass rush. He posted 26 tackles and 1 sack last year, and more importantly spent time in one of the best pass rushing groups in the nation. That experience matters for a defense that will be rebuilt front to back. His veteran voice and habits are vital for a unit that has started slow in recent seasons because so many portal additions had to gel at once. Experience is the point here, and it is going to be key across the entire defense.\n\nYes, the name and backstory drew headlines, but the on-field production backs it up. Lampron is a journeyman senior who tallied 65 tackles, 2.5 sacks, and 2 forced fumbles last season for Bowling Green. The origin story matters too, as Lampron randomly ran into Coach Prime on a plane a few months ago and gave coach his pitch. Prime’s staff did the homework, and Lampron had an offer before they even deboarded. With the Buffs staring at a completely new defensive unit next season; Lampron brings toughness, proven production, and immediate special teams value to steady that transition.\n\nScudero arrives in Boulder after turning in one of the best sophomore campaigns in the country with nearly 1,300 receiving yards and 11 touchdowns. At 5’9, 175, he wins with agility, quickness, and crisp route running. In Brennan Marion’s system he’s a plug-and-play starting slot, the kind of chain-mover who keeps JuJu on schedule and punishes single coverage. He is also one of the most talented portal additions Boulder has seen in the last few years, so there is no reason to think he won’t be on the field from the first series in the fall.\n\nCarter arrives from Tennessee, a hometown Vol who had a real path to playing time in the SEC, which tells you the offer to come to Boulder was serious, and for good reason. He was ranked the No. 5 safety in the transfer portal and his tape backs it up. Last season he played like a ball magnet, forcing three fumbles and breaking up three passes. For a Buffs team that has struggled to force turnovers, and just lost turnover-creator Tawfiq Byard, Carter was a must-sign for Deion Sanders. He has two years of eligibility left, but may need to produce immediately in a playmaking-needy back end.\n\nA St. John Bosco grad, Moore comes to Boulder with one year of eligibility and a top-ten transfer grade (No. 8 in the portal). At Texas he stacked just under 1,000 yards and 11 touchdowns across the last two seasons as a starting wideout. His 6’0, 190 frame is not about freak measurables, as it is the ideal all-purpose receiver body that lets Brennan Marion fit him seamlessly into the Go-Go offense. After the departures of Omarion Miller, Sincere Brown, and others, Moore is expected to have the biggest season of any incoming transfer. Personally, I think he profiles as the X reciever, where he’ll be expected to win outside the numbers, on slants, digs, comebacks, and posts. Moore has the experience, production, and frame to be JuJu Lewis’s No. 1 target come September.",

    "description": "New policies limiting the teaching of race and gender issues led administrators and professors to change hundreds of courses. School leaders say the rules could hurt A&M’s reputation.",
    "fullText": "Texas A&M University said on Friday that it would end its women’s and gender studies program, and that the syllabuses for hundreds of courses had been altered under new policies limiting how race and gender ideology may be discussed in classrooms.\n\nThe university said that six courses had been canceled entirely because of the new rules, out of the roughly 5,400 that were planned for this semester at one of the nation’s largest public universities.\n\nThe A&M system’s regents — all of them appointed by Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican — approved the restrictive policies late last year, and officials have been scrambling since then to interpret and enforce them. Supporters contend that the rules are appropriate measures to prevent political ideologies, especially those often associated with the left, from entering classrooms. Opponents say the approach encourages self-censorship and is itself ideological.\n\nA top-down demand to scrutinize a university’s entire course catalog in so short a time is extraordinarily rare in the United States, where professors have long had sweeping control over their syllabuses.\n\n“I have never seen anything like this,” said Leonard Bright, a professor in A&M’s Bush School of Government and Public Service and the president of the American Association of University Professors chapter in College Station, where the A&M system has its flagship campus of more than 74,000 students.\n\nThe regents do not seem interested in the academic freedom of students and the faculty, he added, only the “freedom of their speech.”\n\nFriday’s announcement about shutting down the university’s women’s and gender studies program went beyond the immediate repercussions that many people had anticipated.\n\nTommy Williams, the university’s interim president, said in a statement that he had directed the closure because of low enrollment and “the difficulty of bringing the program in compliance with the new system policies.” He said that students who were already pursuing degrees or certificates in the program would be able to complete them.\n\nIn 2024, the regents ordered A&M to drop its minor in L.G.B.T.Q. studies. But ending a full bachelor’s degree program represents a sharp escalation in the debate over what should be taught at public universities in Texas, the nation’s most populous conservative state.\n\nA&M is not the first school to drop gender studies. New College of Florida, for example, moved in 2023 to shut down its program, which had operated for decades.\n\nUntil Friday, discussions at A&M had often focused on how individual courses this semester would be affected by the new limits, which Mr. Williams argued in an interview this week had “restored rigor into some areas where maybe we had had some drift.”\n\n“This has given us a transparent way to go through and make sure that what we’re advertising the course is about is actually what’s being taught,” he said on Tuesday, adding that the approach “strengthens academic integrity, it protects our academic standards and, I think, most importantly, it builds trust in higher education.”\n\nA&M officials have nevertheless been bracing for recriminations, including possible court challenges, and for prospective students or professors to be thinking twice about heading to College Station.\n\n“It’s been harmful to our reputation, there’s no question about that,” said Mr. Williams, a Republican former state legislator. “But I think it’s transitory.”\n\nMr. Williams, who previously worked for Mr. Abbott, said he had not discussed the policies with the governor. And during the interview, Mr. Williams did not mention any plans concerning the women’s and gender studies program, which currently has 28 students enrolled in its major.\n\nUnder the new systemwide policies, no A&M course may “advocate race or gender ideology, or topics related to sexual orientation or gender identity.” Certain classes that are not part of the core curriculum may include teaching about those subjects, but only if a campus president agrees that there is “a necessary educational purpose.”\n\nAsked whether any part of him believed that the policies went too far, Mr. Williams replied, “No.” Pressed on whether deans and department heads would share that view, Mr. Williams responded, “Some would and some would not.”\n\nFor the most part, those deans and department heads have been the ones trying to navigate how far A&M should go in excising content.\n\n“Day by day, we began to have a clearer understanding of where the line may be,” said Simon North, the interim dean of the College of Arts and Sciences in College Station.\n\nDr. North acknowledged, though, that it was impossible to know exactly how many courses had been affected because some faculty members may have modified their syllabuses themselves.\n\n“There are actions that people took in consultation with us,” Dr. North said, “and there are actions that people may have done on their own.”\n\nSyllabus reviews largely took place at the departmental and college levels, but some reached the interim president’s desk. As he prepared this week to weigh requests for exemptions, Mr. Williams said that “common sense is what we’re trying to use as our gauge.”\n\nHe said that A&M officials were not looking to cut material in ways that might prevent students from being competitive in the marketplace, and that opponents of the new rules had “confused what academic freedom is.”\n\n“It doesn’t mean you get to do whatever you want to in the classroom,” he said. “You have academic freedom, but it comes along with the responsibility, and part of that responsibility is to make sure that the learning outcomes are achieved and they’re done in a way that’s compliant with state and federal law and what our regents mandate us to do.”\n\nEven before the wholesale course review, Texas A&M was debating what content was appropriate in college classrooms. In September, the university fired a lecturer for displaying a gender unicorn — which is used to explain the differences between gender expression and gender identity — during a course on children’s literature. The president of the university at the time — Mr. Williams’s predecessor — quickly stepped down.\n\nA faculty appeals panel ruled that the university was “not justified” when it ousted the lecturer, Melissa McCoul, but A&M has refused to reinstate her.\n\nThen the regents’ policies deepened the turmoil. One of the largest ruptures unspooled in the philosophy department, after a professor, Martin Peterson, proposed including portions of Plato’s Symposium in a contemporary moral issues course that can be used to fulfill a core curriculum requirement.\n\nHe also scheduled teaching modules covering race and gender ideology. He had discussed similar topics in the course in the past, though previous syllabuses showed that the modules had different names, like “race and gender issues.”\n\nKristi Sweet, the head of the philosophy department, asked him to “mitigate” the course to remove that content, or face reassignment to a different class. After the dispute became public, university officials repeatedly suggested that Dr. Peterson had constructed his syllabus as a provocation.\n\nDr. Peterson acknowledged that he had wanted to “test the waters,” but he said in an interview this week that he thought the Platonic passages would be less contentious than material he had assigned in the past: an excerpt from the Supreme Court ruling that recognized a right to same-sex marriage. He has since replaced the disputed modules and Plato readings with lessons about academic freedom.\n\nAdministrators note that Plato appears in the syllabuses for other classes.\n\n“Hundreds of Aggies are reading Plato in their courses right now,” Dr. Sweet said. She added that the entirety of Plato’s Symposium was being taught in the Philosophy of Art course, and that despite a wide outcry over its handling of the Peterson class, the department’s “strategic priorities for continued excellence are untouched by current events.”\n\nDr. Bright, the A.A.U.P. chapter president, has faced questions about his own courses. Administrators initially flagged an article that included discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity. But the dean of the Bush School, John Sherman, told Dr. Bright that administrators would support letting him use that text, “given the scholarly nature of the work and the applicability of the reading.”\n\nAnother of Dr. Bright’s courses worried administrators more.\n\nDr. Bright wrote that the course would examine the impact of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation and other social identities “on public policy and the professional ethical responsibilities of public servants.”\n\nDr. Sherman asked him how sexual orientation would be covered. After Dr. Bright responded that it was impossible to say exactly when the subject might come up in a discussion-driven course, the dean canceled the class.\n\n“To say this gives me no pleasure is an understatement,” Dr. Sherman wrote. “To be clear, transparency does not equate to censorship.”\n\nDr. Bright said that university leaders had made an impossible demand about a course that is often shaped by current events.\n\nIt is rare for university governing boards to make decisions that reach so far into classrooms so quickly. Still, R. Bowen Loftin, a former A&M president, said there were few practical options available to campus officials who might disagree with the regents.\n\n“When you become an administrator, especially at a public institution, there’s going to be limits on what you can say and what you can do, and you have to come to grips with that,” he said.\n\nDr. North, the arts and sciences dean, said “questions of academic freedom and academic responsibilities are really difficult,” but that he was “trying to implement these changes in a way that puts students first and supports faculty.”\n\nDr. Bright showed little patience with such defenses.\n\n“When it comes to certain things, you’ve got to say no,” he said. “I don’t excuse administrators from that responsibility.”",

    "fullText": "One week after her 8-year-old son was killed in a crash along Highway 114 in Wise County, a Rhome mother is calling on the state to make changes she believes could prevent another tragedy.\n\nHer son, Matteo Rodriguez, was riding home from school last Thursday, sitting in the passenger seat with his grandmother, when their vehicle was struck at the intersection of Highway 114 and Alliance Boulevard in Rhome, also known as County Road 4841.\n\nWise County EMS said the crash happened as the vehicle was turning and a three-quarter-ton truck his grandmother could not see. The truck struck the passenger side, hitting Matteo.\n\nThe second grader at Prairie View Elementary School in Northwest ISD lost his pulse at the scene.\n\nFirst responders were able to revive him, and he was airlifted to Cook Children’s Medical Center. However, Matteo died during the flight.\n\n“At first I was shocked,” his mother said. “I was like, no. Don’t say that.”\n\nShe said Matteo’s grandmother immediately blamed herself.\n\n“She said, ‘I killed your son,’” Matteo’s mother said. “She blamed herself from the very first moment.”\n\nNow, Matteo’s mother is pushing for change at the intersection where her son was killed. She has launched a Change.org petition calling on the Texas Department of Transportation to install a traffic signal at the busy crossing. As of this week, the petition has gathered more than 9,000 signatures.\n\nWhen asked if a traffic light could have made a difference, she did not hesitate.\n\n“Yes,” she said. “Totally. With all my heart.”\n\nWFAA reached out to TxDOT about the incident, but has not received a response.\n\nMatteo’s mother is a Kindergarten teacher at his elementary school. She said her last moments with him were simple and joyful.\n\nA student had gifted her a small ladybug stuffed animal, and Matteo was excited to take it home.\n\n“I told him, remember you have the ladybug,” she said. “Put it in your backpack so we can bring it back tomorrow. He left so happy.”\n\nAfter Matteo died, she noticed something that stopped her.\n\n“When I entered the hospital room, he had the ladybug on his shoulder,” she said. “The ladybug came back to me, but not him.”\n\nMatteo was her youngest child, born after she suffered a miscarriage.\n\n“They ripped part of my heart,” she said. “I won’t be able to see my kid graduate.”\n\nDespite the grief, she says she will keep pushing for change, hoping Matteo’s story leads to action and saves lives.\n\n“I don’t want another family to go through this,” she said.",

    "fullText": "EL PASO, Texas (KTSM) — El Paso District Court Judge Marlene Gonzalez is stepping back from cases involving migrant children, following allegations that she behaved impartially and prejudiced toward them in hearings.\n\n“As a judge, the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct prevents me from submitting to an interview or commenting on a case that I have recused myself from hearing. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to provide this response,” read a statement from Gonzalez who noted she voluntarily recused herself from hearings regarding unaccompanied migrant children’s cases.\n\nOn Dec. 17, 2025, attorneys from Estrella del Paso – an immigrant advocacy organization – filed a motion to recuse Gonzalez from hearings involving unaccompanied migrant children – children entering the U.S. illegally and without a parent or guardian.\n\nIn the court filing, attorneys and social services workers with the organization submitted written declarations detailing allegations that Gonzalez showed a “pattern and practice of cruelty” towards migrant children during the hearings.\n\nThe declarations made allegations that Gonzalez would subject children to humiliating interrogations about why they left their country, and that on multiple occasions she shamed the children for abandoning their parents.\n\nIn one account an attorney alleged that Gonzalez interrogated a 17-year-old Guatemalan boy who testified that he fled his country to Mexico from an abusive alcoholic father, but that he was kidnapped and beat up twice while in Mexico. The attorney alleged that in response, Gonzalez “harangued” the boy: “Why didn’t you stay in another part of Mexico? It’s beautiful, and it’s big. Why didn’t you stay in another part of Mexico?” the document read.\n\nIn another hearing involving a 16-year old Venezuelan girl from Venezuela who had been a victim of child prostitution, an attorney alleged that Gonzalez scolded the child “not to engage in prostitution.”\n\nThe filing went on to note that despite these alleged practices by Gonzalez, she would “unexpectedly” grant children their petitions seeking Special Immigrant Juvenile Visas, but that she recently began denying the petitions without providing any reasoning in 2025.\n\nEstrella del Paso declined an interview request with KTSM and instead offered the following statement:\n\n“For nearly 40 years, Estrella del Paso has provided legal representation and other legal services to immigrants in El Paso. We are a non-profit law firm. As attorneys, we take our legal and ethical duties to our clients very seriously, and we file every motion and document with the court with these duties in mind. The motion filed includes several detailed examples that our legal team took time and detailed care to compile. For accuracy and completeness, we encourage you to refer directly to that filing. We will not comment on the motions or our interactions with the court. All our clients are owed a duty of confidentiality, and we will not violate this duty, especially in the case of vulnerable children.”\n\nGonzalez’s current term runs through 2028.",
