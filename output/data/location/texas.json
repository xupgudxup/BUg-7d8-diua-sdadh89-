    "fullText": "A two-day undercover sting targeting men trying to buy sex in North Texas resulted in 20 arrests at a Fort Worth hotel in November.\n\nAll arrested face felony charges of solicitation of prostitution, which carries a possible sentence of up to two years in prison for a first offense.\n\nThe Tarrant County Sheriff's Office emphasized the high local demand for commercial sex, noting that the majority of victims, traffickers, and buyers are local residents.\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas - A two-day undercover sting in November led to 20 arrests as the Tarrant County Sheriff’s Office targeted people attempting to buy sex in North Texas, authorities said.\n\nFOX 4 reporter, Peyton Yager, was granted rare behind-the-scenes access as members of the sheriff’s human trafficking unit, along with investigators from the Texas Department of Public Safety and Arlington police, conducted operations inside a Fort Worth hotel. The sting focused on men responding to online solicitation ads posted by undercover officers.\n\nInvestigators said the operation began long before officers knocked on hotel room doors. At the sheriff’s administrative building, undercover personnel posing as women posted advertisements offering sex acts for specific prices, a requirement under Texas law to meet the definition of solicitation of prostitution.\n\nOnce a suspect agreed to a sex act and a dollar amount, investigators used the phone number to run background checks and prepare the team positioned at the hotel.\n\n\"We need them to identify what sex act they want and also have the dollar amount exchanged,\" said Melinda Clark of the sheriff’s human trafficking unit.\n\nAs the men arrived for their appointments, officers moved in. Some were arrested immediately upon entering the room, while others attempted to flee or resist as officers subdued them. Turner said it is common during operations to communicate with hundreds of potential buyers, even if only a fraction ultimately shows up.\n\nThose arrested included a church sign-language interpreter, men with families and at least one person officers said intended to take a woman to a truck stop to be trafficked. Several suspects also faced drug possession or resisting arrest charges.\n\nAll were booked into the Tarrant County Jail on charges of solicitation of prostitution, which is a felony in Texas and carries a possible sentence of up to two years in prison for a first offense. None of the men has been convicted in the cases stemming from this operation.\n\n\"This is occurring every day,\" said Commander Kevin Turner, who leads the county’s human trafficking team. \"It’s unimaginable how much there is out there.\"\n\n\"It shows how strong the demand for commercial sex is here in North Texas,\" he said.\n\nTurner emphasized that human trafficking does not fit common misconceptions.\n\n\"The majority of our victims, especially when it comes to sex trafficking, were born and raised here locally,\" he said. \"The traffickers are born and raised here locally. Our buyers are born and raised here locally.\"\n\nThe nonprofit DeliverFund provided technology and data support during the sting. \"It gets busy sometimes,\" said DeliverFund’s Alisha Willemssen. \"Keeping track of who is talking to whom\" helps investigators avoid overlap as they pose as multiple online identities.\n\nAdvocates say arrests alone won’t curb the problem.\n\nThe Fort Worth nonprofit, The Net, works with survivors and also with men arrested for solicitation through its MASE (Men Against Sexual Exploitation) program, offering resources in hopes of reducing repeat offenses.\n\n\"We know that just the threat of arrest or jail time alone is not going to keep them from doing this again,\" said Ty Bowden, the organization’s associate director. \"We want to get at the root of what’s bringing them here.\"\n\nThe Tarrant County human trafficking unit, formed in 2021, has conducted several stings in recent years. As large-scale events such as the 2026 World Cup approach, Turner said law enforcement agencies are preparing for increased demand and continuing to refine their response.\n\n\"They really wanted to show how prevalent it is,\" he said, \"and how it happens at hotels near you.\"\n\nInformation in this story was provided by FOX 4's Peyton Yager.",

    "description": "Three veteran starters have been ruled out for LSU's appearance in the Texas Bowl in late December.",
    "fullText": "LSU football will take the field for the Texas Bowl without three key starters. According to NOLA.com’s Wilson Alexander, cornerback Mansoor Delane, quarterback Garrett Nussmeier and linebacker Whit Weeks will all miss the Tigers’ contest against Houston due to injuries.\n\nNussmeier missing this outing shouldn’t come as a big surprise. He missed the last three games of LSU’s season due to a core injury that had been bothering him since fall camp. Since he’s likely preparing for the NFL Draft and the Tigers want to see more of sophomore quarterback Michael Van Buren, it wasn’t expected that he would play.\n\nWeeks’ absence also isn’t much of a shock. He broke his ankle during LSU’s game against Ole Miss, and despite retaking the field for the Tigers’ final two games of the season, he probably needs to focus on rehabbing for either his senior season with the Tigers or the NFL draft.\n\nThe same goes for Delane, who played through a core injury for most of the season and is expected to be a first-round pick in the upcoming 2026 NFL draft.\n\nLSU has already gotten a good look at the depth behind Weeks and Nussmeier due to their missed time, but Delane being out will give Tigers fans an early look at the young cornerback duo of D.J. Pickett and P.J. Woodland, the latter of whom spent more time in the slot during the games when Delane was healthy.\n\nLSU will face the Houston Cougars on December 27th at 8:15 CT.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: LSU football rules out three starters for bowl game vs Houston",

    "fullText": "Quarterback recruiting in the 2026 cycle was a breeze for Arizona State. It identified El Paso (Texas) Del Valle four-star quarterback Jake Fette as a top target and landed his commitment in September of 2024.\n\nThe Rivals top-100 prospect saw his stock soar heading into his senior season and that led to other high-profile programs checking in. Fette stayed solid with the Sun Devils, though, signing with the Big 12 program last week. He’s the No. 7 QB in the Rivals300.\n\nWith National Signing Day for the 2026 cycle now in the past, many are now getting a feel for the 2027 board. When looking at junior QBs, though, many are already committed. Of the top 25 signal-callers in the cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, 14 are pledged.\n\nAccording to the Rivals Recruiting Prediction Machine, Arizona State is trending for one of the top uncommitted 2027 QBs in the nation. Once again, he resides in the Lone Star State.\n\nBastrop (Texas) four-star QB Weston Nielsen told Rivals’ Sam Spiegelman at the end of September that no program was recruiting him harder than ASU. Now, Spiegelman has been joined by Rivals’ Steve Wiltfong, who logged a pick this month in favor of the Sun Devils landing Nielsen’s commitment.\n\nThe 6-foot-1, 175-pounder will announce his commitment this Saturday, Dec. 13. Arrows continue to point toward Tempe and Kenny Dillingham.\n\n“They still sit pretty high on my board after another visit,” Nielsen told Spiegelman this fall. “They are recruiting me the hardest. They were able to tell me about their program and why they are a good place to be. I definitely felt more connected with them when I left.”\n\nNielsen eclipsed 3,000 passing yards for the second season in a row this fall. Bastrop went 10-3 and the blue-chipper threw 44 touchdowns to just six interceptions. He also rushed for five scores and now has over 100 total TDs to his name at the high school level.\n\nNielsen is the No. 269 overall prospect and No. 20 QB in the 2027 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all major recruiting media companies. He’s also the No. 42 player in Texas.\n\nThe Sun Devils opened their 2027 class earlier this month by landing a pledge from Chino Hills (Calif.) Orange Lutheran four-star wide receiver Nico Bland. He checks in as the No. 188 recruit and No. 23 WR in the nation.\n\nAlong with Fette, ASU signed 18 other prospects and compiled the No. 35 class in the nation, according to the Rivals Industry Team Recruiting Rankings. The class can be seen here.",

    "fullText": "A recent statewide ranking named the Austin-area suburb Leander as the No. 5 best city in Texas to move to for 2025, and other Austin neighbors made the list as well.\n\nThe analysis, conducted by a customer review and news platform called ConsumerAffairs, evaluated the 50 most populated Texas cities across five categories: affordability, safety, economy, health care and education, in addition to overall quality of life, to determine which cities were best to move to. Each city earned a score out of 100 possible points.\n\nLeander stood out, the analysis said, for its safety ranking — No. 1 statewide — and it also secured the No. 2 spot for its booming economy.\n\nHowever, the city’s rankings were more modest in other areas. The report ranked Leader No. 12 for health care and education, No. 32 for affordability and No. 40 for quality of life.\n\n“Leander’s origin dates back to the 1880s, when a rail line was constructed to connect Austin to Abilene,” the report said. “Nowhere among Texas’ largest cities is violent crime less common, and over the past five years, no metro area has experienced faster job growth.”\n\nThe suburb, which has a population of around 78,000, was also ranked as one of the top ten places to live by U.S. News and World Reports for 2025-2026.\n\nThe top four cities on the ConsumerAffairs list were all in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, followed by Leander and then Round Rock at No. 9.",

    "description": "The U.S.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court in a free speech case on Monday opted not to hear an appeal by a group of residents of a rural Texas county of a judicial decision allowing local officials to remove ​17 books that these officials deemed objectionable from public libraries.\n\nThe justices let stand a lower court's decision allowing the removal of books ‌including ones dealing with themes of race and LGBT identity, from its public library system. The lower court rejected the argument made by the plaintiffs that removing the books was ‌unlawful under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protections against government abridgment of free speech.\n\nThe decision by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals applies to the states of Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi but does not set a nationwide legal precedent.\n\nThere has been a surge in book banning in public schools and public libraries in recent years in many locations around the United States, driven by conservative groups and new state laws limiting what kinds of books children ⁠can access.\n\nLlano County is a rural area about 80 ‌miles (130 km) from the Texas state capital Austin. The dispute began in 2021 when one faction of local residents asked the Llano County library commissioner to remove the disputed books, which covered topics including transgender issues, race and slavery ‍in the United States, puberty and bodily functions like flatulence.\n\nThe 17 works at issue include the 1970 book \"In the Night Kitchen\" by acclaimed author Maurice Sendak due to the depiction of its main character, a boy named Mickey, as nude in some of its illustrations as he visits a surreal kitchen in a dream.\n\nThe library commission ​ordered librarians to comply with the demands, and residents who pushed for the book removals were appointed to a local county board.\n\nA different group ‌of county residents sued to challenge the book ban, alleging their First Amendment rights had been violated.\n\nAt issue is a First Amendment principle called the right to receive information. The Supreme Court long ago concluded that the First Amendment encompasses a fundamental right to receive information and ideas, as it is necessary for the meaningful exercise of other First Amendment rights such as freedom of religion, expression, speech, assembly and the press.\n\nA federal judge in 2023 ordered county officials to restore the disputed books to the library system. But the 5th Circuit in a 10-7 decision reversed the judge's ruling and sided ⁠with the county. The 5th Circuit concluded that public library patrons have no right ​to receive information under the First Amendment.\n\nWriting for the 5th Circuit, Judge Stuart Kyle Duncan ​asserted that \"no one is banning\" books by removing them from libraries.\n\n\"If a disappointed patron can't find a book in the library, he can order it online, buy it from a bookstore or borrow it from a friend,\" wrote Duncan, a ‍judicial appointee of Republican President Donald Trump. \"All ⁠Llano County has done here is what libraries have been doing for two centuries: decide which books they want in their collections.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in a 1982 case that school boards may not remove books because they dislike the ideas contained in those titles. The ⁠justices splintered in their reasoning at that time, leaving the scope of the First Amendment right to receive information unclear.\n\nIn another case, the Supreme Court in June ruled in favor ‌of Christian and Muslim parents in Maryland who sued to keep their elementary school children out of certain classes when ‌storybooks with LGBT characters are read.",

    "fullText": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday designated one of the largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy groups in the U.S. a “foreign terrorist organization,” following a similar step by Texas last month.\n\nThe directive against the Council on American-Islamic Relations comes in an executive order DeSantis posted on the social media site X. It also gives the same label to the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nNeither CAIR nor the Muslim Brotherhood is designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. government.\n\nThe order instructs Florida agencies to prevent the two groups and those who have provided them material support from receiving contracts, employment and funds from a state executive or cabinet agency.\n\nIn an emailed statement, CAIR and its Florida chapter said the organization plans to sue DeSantis in response to what it called an “unconstitutional” and “defamatory” proclamation.\n\nFounded in 1994, CAIR has 25 chapters around the country.\n\nCAIR last month asked a federal judge to strike down Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's proclamation, saying in a lawsuit that it was “not only contrary to the United States Constitution, but finds no support in any Texas law.”\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood was established in Egypt nearly a century ago and has branches around the world. Its leaders say it renounced violence decades ago and seeks to set up Islamic rule through elections and other peaceful means. Critics, including autocratic governments across the Middle East region, view it as a threat.",

    "fullText": "AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear an appeal on a Texas free speech case that allowed local officials to remove books deemed objectionable from public libraries.\n\nThe case stemmed from a 2022 lawsuit by a group of residents in rural Llano County over the removal from the public library of more than a dozen books dealing with sex, race and gender themes, as well as humorously touching on topics such as flatulence.\n\nA lower federal appeals court had ruled that removing the books did not violate Constitutional free speech protections.\n\nThe case had been closely watched by publishers and librarians across the country. The Supreme Court's decision to not consider the case was criticized by free speech rights groups.\n\nThe Texas case has already been used to ban books in other areas of the country, said Elly Brinkley, staff attorney for U.S. Free Expression Programs at PEN America.\n\n“Leaving the Fifth Circuit’s ruling in place erodes the most elemental principles of free speech and allows state and local governments to exert ideological control over the people with impunity. The government has no place telling people what they can and cannot read,\" Brinkley said.\n\nSam Helmick, president of the American Library Association, said the Supreme Court's decision not to consider the case \"threatens to transform government libraries into centers for indoctrination instead of protecting them as centers of open inquiry, undermining the First Amendment right to read unfettered by viewpoint-based censorship.”\n\nThe Texas case began when a group of residents asked the county library commission to remove the group of books from circulation. The local commission ordered librarians to comply and a separate group of residents sued to keep the books on the shelves.\n\nLlano County, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) northwest of the Texas capital of Austin, has a population of about 20,000. It is mostly white and conservative, with deep ties to agriculture and deer hunting.\n\nThe book titles originally ordered removed included, “Caste: The Origins of Our Discontent” by Isabel Wilkerson; “They Called Themselves the K.K.K: The Birth of an American Terrorist Group,” by Susan Campbell Bartoletti; “In the Night Kitchen” by Maurice Sendak; “It’s Perfectly Normal: Changing Bodies, Growing Up, Sex and Sexual Health” by Robie H. Harris; and “Being Jazz: My Life as a (Transgender) Teen” by Jazz Jennings.\n\nOther titles include “Larry the Farting Leprechaun” by Jane Bexley and “My Butt is So Noisy!” by Dawn McMillan.\n\nA federal judge ordered the county to restore some of the books in 2023, but that decision was reversed earlier this year by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.\n\nThe county at one point briefly considered closing its public libraries rather than return the books to the shelves after the federal judge's initial order.\n\nIn its order on May 23, the appeals court's majority opinion said the decision to remove a book from the library shelf is not a book ban.\n\n“No one is banning (or burning books). If a disappointed patron can't find a book in the library, he can order it online, buy it from a bookstore or borrow it from a friend,” the appeals court opinion said.\n\nLlano County Judge Ron Cunningham, the ranking official in the county, did not immediately respond to an email to his office seeking comment.\n\nHillel Italie contributed from New York City.",
