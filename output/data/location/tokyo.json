It's hard to put into words how different my life is now. It's very busy, but it was one of the most enjoyable times ever,\" reflected O'Connor in an interview with BBC Sport NI's Thomas Kane.\n\n\"I could never have predicted this all to happen. I know I've always put in a lot of work, but this year was just a completely different level.\n\n\"To win one medal was insane. To win two was crazy. And then to win two more after that, I just could never have imagined that would happen.\"",

    "fullText": "A United Airlines flight bound for Tokyo was forced to return to Washington Dulles International Airport on Saturday after losing power in one of its engines shortly after takeoff, triggering a brush fire on the ground and prompting a federal investigation. The Boeing 777-200 was carrying 275 passengers when the incident occurred, according to the airline.\n\nUnited Flight 803 departed Dulles around 12:35 p.m. en route to Tokyo’s Haneda Airport. After the engine issue was detected, the aircraft circled the area for just under an hour before landing safely back at Dulles. United said there were eight crew members aboard and no injuries were reported.\n\nU.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy said in a post on X that a piece of the jet’s engine cover broke off after takeoff, sparking a brush fire near the runway. He added that the Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the incident.\n\nI've been briefed on United Flight 803 from Dulles to Japan. \n\nHere’s what we know:\n -An engine failed on the Boeing 777-200ER shortly after take-off\n -275 passengers, 15 crew members on board\n -A piece of the engine cover separated and caught fire, sparking a brush fire on… https://t.co/IxkFJU2Fes\n\n— Secretary Sean Duffy (@SecDuffy) December 13, 2025\n\nEmily McGee, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, said the fire was quickly extinguished and that airport fire and rescue crews evaluated the aircraft after it returned. Smoke from the brush fire was visible across the tarmac as other flights continued arriving and departing.\n\nThe incident briefly disrupted operations at Dulles and drew the attention of passengers across the airport.\n\nHouman David Hemmati, a California-based ophthalmologist, was seated on a separate United flight bound for Los Angeles when his pilot announced a ground stop.\n\n“We are on a ground stop,” the pilot told passengers, Hemmati said. “There’s an incident on the runway.”\n\nLooking out his window, Hemmati said he saw thick smoke rising near the runway, illuminated by flashing emergency vehicles. He took photos and posted on X, writing, “Praying it’s not a crash.”\n\nHemmati’s flight was later diverted to another runway and allowed to depart around 1 p.m. As the plane climbed, he said smoke was still visible below.\n\nCommercial aircraft are designed to fly safely on a single engine, particularly during critical phases like takeoff. Pilots train extensively for engine failures, and standard protocol typically calls for returning to the departure airport when a problem occurs shortly after liftoff.\n\nKey details from the incident include:\n\nFlight: United Airlines Flight 803\n\nPassengers: 275 passengers and eight crew members\n\nIssue: Loss of power in one engine after takeoff\n\nGround impact: Engine cover debris sparked a brush fire\n\nOutcome: Safe return to Dulles with no reported injuries\n\nNext step: FAA investigation underway\n\nUnited praised the response of its crews and airport personnel in a statement released Saturday.\n\n“United is grateful to our crews and to the teams at Washington Dulles for their quick work to help ensure the safety of everyone involved,” the airline said. United added that it is working to rebook passengers on a later flight.\n\nThe FAA has not released details on what caused the engine cover to detach or whether the aircraft had any prior maintenance issues. Investigators are expected to examine flight data, maintenance records, and debris from the engine as part of the inquiry.\n\nThe Boeing 777 remains one of the most widely used wide-body aircraft in international travel, but any engine-related issue shortly after takeoff draws immediate scrutiny from regulators.\n\nFor passengers aboard Flight 803, the incident ended without injury but with a tense delay to an already long journey. For United and federal investigators, the focus now turns to determining what failed and whether any broader inspections are needed.\n\nThe FAA’s findings will ultimately determine whether the incident was an isolated mechanical failure or part of a larger concern.",
