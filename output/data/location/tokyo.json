    "fullText": "Passengers flying from Japan to Europe endured a 14-hour-long flight to nowhere on Tuesday after an engine issue.\n\nAll Nippon Airways Flight 223 left Tokyo around 11 a.m. and was scheduled to land in Frankfurt, Germany, about 14 hours later.\n\nHowever, over six hours into the journey, it turned around while flying over the Arctic Ocean, north of Alaska.\n\nFlight-tracking data shows how the Boeing 787 then headed back to the Japanese capital.\n\nIt took another eight hours to reach Tokyo's Haneda Airport, where Flight 223 touched down around 1 a.m.\n\nThe plane diverted due to a \"low engine oil level,\" an ANA spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\nEngine oil differs from jet fuel and is used to lubricate and cool the moving parts inside the engine. Returning to Tokyo, the airline's main hub, would mean more resources for maintenance and repair.\n\nThe spokesperson added that the flight departed again on Wednesday morning, with a change of aircraft and crew.\n\nData from Flightradar24 shows the new plane departed at around 7:30 a.m. and is supposed to land in Frankfurt around 1 p.m. local time. That's about 20 hours later than passengers initially expected to get there.\n\n\"The safety of our passengers and crew is our top priority,\" the spokesperson said. \"We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to our customers by this extensive delay.\"\n\nSince the plane turned around roughly halfway through a huge journey, it was a particularly gruelling flight to nowhere — but not the longest.\n\nLast June, a Qantas flight to Paris returned to Perth after 15 hours. It was mid-flight when Iran launched strikes against a US air base in Qatar, closing some of the world's most congested airspace.\n\nAnd in 2023, Air New Zealand passengers had a 16-hour flight to nowhere after an electrical fire in a terminal at New York's JFK Airport.",

    "fullText": "What stemmed from a 10-day trip to Hong Kong in 2009 to visit my then-boyfriend blossomed into a love story with Asia.\n\nOn my first foray into the East, I landed bright-eyed, eager, and entirely clueless. My welcome meal — a dim sum feast — was a revelation. With my now-husband and 10 of his newest friends, we encircled a table piled with dozens of steamer baskets filled with dimpled sweet buns, flaky taro puffs, braised meats, crispy-bottomed dumplings, and more.\n\nIgnoring my lack of chopsticks experience, I dove in, unsteadily maneuvering a still-steaming bun toward my plate. My finger slipped. And the pastry, in all its custard-filled rotundness, plopped into my teacup, forming a geyser of hot liquid that sprayed those around me.\n\nMortified, I vowed to use chopsticks at every meal until I mastered them. Seventeen years in, it has shaped my sense of self and defined my career as a food journalist.\n\nTraversing epicurean-fueled travels, here are three gastronomic destinations I recommend to fellow travelers, and one I don't, despite the fanfare surrounding it.\n\nFrom bustling street stalls to iconic hole-in-the-wall gems, Thailand's culinary landscape has pulled me in a dozen times over.\n\nBeyond the conventional pad thai and mango sticky rice, there's a deep-rooted legacy of punchy flavors, best washed down with a frothy glass of silky-sweet Thai milk tea.\n\nOne of my most memorable encounters happened by chance, when I ducked into a small storefront to escape a sudden downpour. Distracted by the rain, I almost missed the bubbling stockpot, until the sight of Lung Cheay's signature egg noodles snapped me back to attention. Beloved by those in the know for its dry tom yum, topped with succulent barbecued pork and soft-boiled eggs, the shop is a classic Thai rags-to-riches story. The line that now snakes down the block is worlds away from its humble beginnings as a pushcart.\n\nOther bites I never miss during a visit to Bangkok span melt-in-your-mouth, marinated seafood smothered in a sour and spicy herb sauce at Pa Nee Kung Chae Nam Pla, fried chicken liberally caked in crisped garlic cloves at Polo Fried Chicken, and late-night pilgrimages to Talad Noi Crab Fried Rice overflowing with carb god devotees praying away tomorrow's impending hangover.\n\nI first visited Ho Chi Minh City, or Saigon, in 2017 and returned three more times that year alone. The city reflects historical influences from China, Cambodia, France, and the US, culminating in a distinctly southern-style Vietnamese cuisine that bridges bold flavors, ferments, and fresh herbs.\n\nStreet food forms the backbone of Saigon, with carts feeding the ebb and flow of passersby like blood pumping to the beat of the city's pulsating heart. As evening marches into night, city corners transform into impromptu eateries, with portable tables, plastic stools, and motorbikes abound.\n\nI've done my fair share of devouring in this street-food mecca. There's Bún Thịt Nướng — Nguyễn Trung Trực, a no-frills, 30-year-old stall known for heaping bowls of vermicelli topped with grilled pork, crisp egg rolls, pickles, and a bouquet of herbs.\n\nThen there's Bún Cá Xe Dẩy, a late-night vendor ladling steaming bowls of canh chua — a tangy pineapple, tamarind, and tomato soup laced with fried fish. And at Xíu Mại chén Đèn Dầu, springy Vietnamese-style meatballs are served in a fragrant broth, with a crusty baguette on the side for dipping.\n\nRegardless of how many times I visit, there's always another miniature plastic chair flanking a buzzing back-alley pop-up waiting for me to take a seat.\n\nMost famous for turning the spice dial up to an 11 through Sichuan peppercorn flakes that vibrate against your lips long after the meal concludes and seemingly innocuous bites that still register on the Scoville scale, eating in Chengdu is an all-out heat offensive.\n\nIt's also my go-to for Chinese culinary travel.\n\nWhile wontons are ubiquitous within China, only in Chengdu will you find hongyou chaoshou (red oil wontons). Coated in chile oil, these crescent-shaped pockets of joy are omnipresent, each spot tweaking the recipe ever-so-slightly to cause a ripple in the die-hard fandom of one wonton shop over the next.\n\nWarming bowls of wontons sprinkled with friendly shopkeeper chitchat earmark my annual pilgrimages to China's spice capital.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, tianshuimian (sweet water noodles) spotlight Sichuan's signature guaiwei, or \"strange flavor\" — a seasoning that folds spicy, salty, sesame, sour, and sweet into a single bite. Cord-like, al dente noodles are swaddled in dark and light soy sauce, chile oil, sesame and garlic pastes, crushed peanuts, Sichuan peppercorns, and brown sugar syrup, forming a gravy that varnishes each strand with an addictive, lip-tingling heat.\n\nSitting with a brimming bowlful of bland noodles in Tokyo, I've been left with frustration rather than fulfillment more times than I care to recount. Japan, as a whole, struggles with excess hype and over-tourism resulting from a fetishization of its culture.\n\nIt's in vogue to collect kawaii memorabilia, swap coffee for matcha, and recount every Miyazaki movie ever made. I even have an anime bowl of ramen tattooed on my arm. (Zero regrets)\n\nTokyo is the epicenter of that trendiness.\n\nOften miscast as the pinnacle of Japanese cuisine, Tokyo tempts visitors, myself included, into chasing viral ramen shops, jiggly pancake cafés, and so-called must-visit markets — places popularized by social media, complete with long waits and inflated prices that rarely justify the hype.\n\nWhile this dynamic exists in many international cities, I find it far more blatant in Tokyo.\n\nThis is in no way a dig at Japanese food; it's one of my favorite cuisines. From thick fillets of bonito seared over dried straw flames in Kochi Prefecture to bubbling streetside vats of oden in Osaka —daikon, tofu, and fish cakes simmered in an aromatic broth — my travels across Japan have almost always left me deeply satisfied.\n\nBut in Tokyo, specifically, I often struggle as an outsider to distinguish between what's genuinely great and what's merely hyped.\n\nStill, with Tokyo as my neighbor, there's always room for a new chapter in my Asian food love saga.",

    "fullText": "TOKYO/BEIJING, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said Japan's strategic alliance with the U.S. would collapse if Tokyo were to turn away from a conflict in Taiwan, but ​distanced herself from previous comments that suggested a possible military response in such an event.\n\nTakaichi expressed ‌her latest views on a nationally broadcast TV programme late on Monday, where an opposition party leader criticised her for igniting ‌tensions with China with the earlier remarks.\n\nTies between Japan and China have sunk to the worst level in years after Takaichi said in November that a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could bring about a Japanese military response. Beijing has responded with export curbs, flight cancellations and vitriolic commentaries, repeatedly demanding a retraction.\n\nChina claims sovereignty ⁠over the democratically-governed island of Taiwan.\n\n“I ‌want to make it absolutely clear that this is not about Japan going out and taking military action if China and the United States come into conflict (over ‍Taiwan),\" Takaichi said on the live TV show, referring to the comments she made in parliament in November.\n\n\"If something serious happens there, we would have to go to rescue the Japanese and American citizens in Taiwan. In that situation, ​there may be cases where we take joint action.\n\n\"And if the U.S. forces, acting jointly with us, ‌come under attack and Japan does nothing and simply runs away, the Japan–U.S. alliance would collapse. So we would respond strictly within the limits of the law — within the limits of the laws as they currently exist — while making a comprehensive judgment based on what is happening on the ground.\"\n\nJAPAN'S CONSTITUTION PROHIBITS DIRECT MILITARY ACTION\n\nWith an eye on the electorate, Takaichi has stopped short of retracting the ⁠remarks from November, saying her stance was consistent with ​Japan's long-standing policy. She has also said that China’s characterisation of ​her remarks was inconsistent with the facts.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday urged Japan to \"earnestly reflect and correct its mistakes, and to stop its manipulation and reckless actions on ‍the Taiwan issue.\"\n\nJapan's pacifist constitution ⁠prohibits direct military action but allows it to exercise the right of collective self-defence, or defending the United States or another friendly country that comes under attack, in cases where Japan faces ⁠a \"threat to its survival.\"\n\nTakaichi has enjoyed high approval ratings since taking office in October 2025 and has called a snap election ‌on February 8, hoping to capitalise on her popularity.",

    "fullText": "From rhino-sized Rhyhorns to worm-like Diglett, visitors to PokéPark Kanto will roam a forest populated by lifelike Pokémon statues when the attraction opens next week\n\nIn Japan, February is normally a period of quiet reflection, a month defined by winter festivals in Sapporo’s snowy mountains and staving off the cold in steaming hot springs. Traditionally, international tourists start to arrive with the blossoms in spring – but thanks to the opening of Pokémon’s first ever amusement park on 5 February, this year, they are likely to come earlier.\n\nUnlike the rollercoaster-filled thrills of Tokyo Disney Sea or Universal Studios Japan in Osaka, PokéPark Kanto is essentially a forest populated by models of the creatures from the perennially popular games. Nestled in the quiet Tokyo suburb of Inagi, half an hour from the city centre, the park is a walkable forest with more than 600 Pokémonin it. Where the Mario-themed Super Nintendo World slots neatly into the massive Universal Studios Japan, PokéPark Kanto is hidden in the back of the less glitzy, funfair-esque Japanese theme park Yomiuri Land.\n\nTaking up 26,000 sq metres, the family-friendly attraction is divided into two main areas: Pokémon Forest and the plaza-esque Sedge Town. Tickets for the park are bought via a lottery system – and currently sold out for the next three months – ranging between ¥7,900 (£38) for a standard adult ticket and ¥14,000 (£66) for a queue-skipping priority pass.\n\nThe park’s creative direction has been overseen by one of the original Pokémon creators, Junichi Masuda. Visitors roam a series of explorable habitats, littered with endearingly lifelike statues of hundreds of Pokémon, arranged in fun tableaus where various species are interacting with each other. Walking through PokéPark Kanto feels akin to becoming a Pokédex-clutching David Attenborough, a re-creation of what it would be like to observe these fantastical creatures in the wild. Beaver-esque Bidoofs use their two front teeth to cut down a real tree. Worm-like Diglett burrow above the soil to greet a smiling Eevee.\n\nEach Pokémon is presented in full scale too, making the larger creatures especially awe-inspiring. From a lorry-sized re-creation of the rocky behemoth Onix to a herd of rhinoceros-sized Rhyhorns lining the main path, each habitat is a joy to behold, with hidden creatures dotted throughout the trees and grass as a reward for eagle-eyed kids.\n\nIn many ways, it’s surprising it has taken this long for a permanent Pokémon theme park to be erected. With Pikachu and pals celebrating their 30th anniversary this year, Pokémon is still comfortably the highest-grossing media brand in the world: its total estimated lifetime revenue of $150bn comfortably surpasses Disney properties such as Star Wars and Marvel. The Pokémon company’s profit rose to ¥70.3bn in the year ending February 2025 – roughly £337m – and with a range of new games, merchandise and the new theme park, its profits in 2026 are only likely to increase.\n\nAfter clearing the Pokémon forest, visitors are greeted by a Pokémon parade in Sedge Town square, where there are also Pokémon-themed versions of fairground games such as ring toss, Pokémon-themed food, and an Eevee-themed carousel. Visitors can also walk into a real-life Pokémon Centre (an iconic building from the games and anime) and grab a seat at a gym where they can watch a live Pokémon battle that blends human performers with cutting-edge animatronics.\n\nThe Pokémon Company has numerous Pokémon Centre shops all over Japan selling exclusive merchandise. PokéPark Kanto will continue this lucrative trend, selling plushies and clothing that people will have to travel there to own. Video games are huge business in Japan, one of the country’s main cultural exports – but theme parks based on the country’s virtual stars are a newer phenomenon. Since Super Nintendo World first opened its doors at Universal Studios Japan in 2021, it has been transplanted to Universal’s parks in Hollywood and Florida, with all locations helping to drive multi-billion dollar quarterly revenues.\n\nThanks to a weak yen post-pandemic, recent years have seen tourists flock to Japan. While it has been a boon to the economy, the flood of incomers has led to tension. From phone-camera-weilding influencers behaving badly, to overcrowded streets inconveniencing locals, the 42 million visitors who arrived in Japan in 2025 have come alongside a notable nationwide rise in anti-foreigner sentiment. Newly appointed prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, is already doubling down on anti-tourist legislation. It’s safe to say that PokéPark Kanto, with its family-friendly international appeal, will only increase visitors to Japan’s overcrowded capital.",

    "fullText": "The concept of natsukashii permeates Japanese culture, from traditional alleyways in Tokyo to the popularity of stores selling film cameras.\n\nDuring my childhood summers spent in Yokohama, Japan, my obaachan (grandmother) would take me on afternoon strolls through her neighbourhood and teach me the names of all the flowers we came across. The cicadas would shriek over her soft voice and the humidity would cling to my body like a second layer of skin. When we returned home, the two of us would cool off over ice-cold glasses of mugicha (barley tea). “Am I your favourite grandchild?” I would ask her. My obaachan would smile and whisper, “Yes.”\n\nMy obaachan passed away in April 2019, and last summer was my first one without her. Now the taste of mugicha takes me back to our precious summer strolls. “Natsukashii,” I always think as the taste hits my tongue.\n\nNatsukashii is a Japanese word used when something evokes a fond memory from your past. It’s a word you exclaim as a smile creeps across your face. For instance, when you hear a song you loved as a teenager, or when you come across an old train ticket stub in your pocket.\n\nIn some cultures, nostalgia is often full of sadness. But natsukashii – which derives from the verb “natsuku”, which means “to keep close and become fond of” – indicates joy and gratitude for the past rather than a desire to return to it. In Japan, natsukashii is a reminder that you are fortunate to have had the experiences you’ve had in life. The fact that you cannot return to those experiences makes them all the more poignant.\n\n• Is this the world's cleanest culture?\n\n• China's strange and baffling quirk\n\n• Why Japan values 'naked communion'\n\n“A positive frame put around longing is the essence of natsukashii,” said Christine Yano, professor of anthropology at the University of Hawaii, whose research focuses on Japanese popular culture. “It’s part of the emotional foundation of Japan. A glass half empty is a glass that’s full and beautiful.”\n\n“I think in Japan, nostalgia has to do with an aesthetic,\" she continued. \"This is the aesthetic that sees beauty in imperfection, in something not being quite complete, in longing, in yearning, in evanescence, in impermanence, wistfulness, in melancholy. It is an aesthetic invested with emotion and beauty at the same time.”\n\nAesthetic concepts in the traditional Japanese arts were developed in pre-modern Japan. One of the earliest to emerge was wabi-sabi, a Japanese philosophy rooted in Buddhism that finds beauty in imperfection and impermanence; examples include deliberately misshapen bowls used in tea ceremonies and bonsai trees displayed even after they’ve shed their leaves. Yano suggests that Japan’s approach to nostalgia is akin to wabi-sabi – but it’s life, rather than objects, that’s being celebrated for its imperfections.\n\nSumie Kawakami, a writer who teaches liberal arts at the International College of Liberal Arts (iCLA) at Japan’s Yamanashi Gakuin University, echoes that sentiment. She describes natsukashii as a bittersweet form of reminiscing. “We miss the time – but it’s better that way,” she said.\n\nIn today’s digital age, people seem to be more obsessed than ever with nostalgia. But in Japan, paying tribute to the past goes far beyond sharing the occasional #ThrowbackThursday post on social media or binge-watching an ‘80s TV show reboot.\n\nOn any given night of the week, Tokyo businessmen can be found blowing off steam in yokocho, traditional alleyways containing bars and restaurants. These cramped, cash-only establishments surrounded by glowing lanterns and cigarette smoke are a portal to another era, as they were originally part of black markets that cropped up in the city following World War Two.\n\nAnd last summer, Japanese Twitter went wild after someone shared a video they made using an app that replicated the VHS camcorder recording quality of the 1980s. Tens of thousands of people rushed to find out what the app was (VHS Cam), then share their own videos using it.\n\n“It always surprises me, the degree to which natsukashii comes up,” Yano told me. “One could say, ‘Oh, that’s mainly for old people.’ But it’s amazing how quickly a young person becomes ‘old’ in terms of natsukashii. An 18-year-old may feel natsukashii for kindergarten days.”\n\nKawakami compares the sentiment to the English phrase \"the good old days”. \"But there may be a slight difference,\" she noted. \"When Japanese say 'natsukashii’, they want to confirm that togetherness, rather than simply being nostalgic to a particular event or person. [It's like] 'Yeah, we were together on this!'\"\n\nThe demand for natsukashii experiences is so strong throughout Japan that there are companies that specialise in creating them. In 2002, Masahito Itami founded Dousoukai Net, a company that organises reunions for alumni across the country. High school and university reunions are commonplace in many parts of the world, but Itami also runs events for former elementary school peers and co-workers from defunct businesses.\n\n“Even if it’s getting together with people you used to work with, there is a sense of intimacy and connection you get from being with the people who’ve shared the same experiences as you,” Itami explained. “Whether they’re good or bad experiences, they all blossom into great stories to look back on together.”\n\nYumi Hisano, an Osaka native who has attended not one, but four high school reunions organised by Dousoukai Net over the past 20 years, agrees.\n\n“It was so meaningful to meet with people I hadn’t seen since getting married and leaving Osaka,” she recalled of the first reunion, which got her hooked. “I wanted to hear their stories and find out how they’d lived since the glory days when so many possibilities lay before us.”\n\nJapan’s love affair with the past, however, goes far beyond people occasionally reuniting with their classmates. This is a culture where people actively seek out natsukashii experiences to add meaning to their lives. An important part to the start of the year is to send nengajo (New Year's greeting cards) to not only close family and friends, but to people they’ve encountered briefly in their lives.\n\nAnother nostalgic tradition falls on New Year’s Eve, when most Japanese stay at home and watch Kōhaku Uta Gassen, an annual TV special featuring musical performances. Even as the show increasingly focusses on contemporary pop idols, it always saves room for enka artists, who sing sentimental ballads about traditional Japanese life and are generally thought of as musicians for older generations. As Yano notes, “In Japan, the past is always kind of a constant hum.”\n\nThat hum even influences consumer behaviour. Despite Japan’s love for modern technology, Bellamy Hunt, a Tokyo-based British camera broker who goes by the nickname “Japan Camera Hunter”, has made a living tracking down, repairing and selling rare film cameras. He says that there’s even been a recent increase in demand for black-and-white film and darkroom rental services in the country.\n\n“To give you a sense of how popular film camera lifestyle is in Japan, there is a major national magazine called Film Camera Style, and it’s just really fancy pictures of [old] cameras and how they’re used and how to use them,” Hunt said.\n\nBut it’s not that the Japanese are shunning their smartphone cameras. Hunt says that about 90% of his clients live abroad, and that part of the reason they’re drawn to Japan is because the culture places such an emphasis on the past and its relics.\n\n“People here look after their stuff,” he said. “I think we’ve lost track of that in the West a little bit.” We’ve taken things for granted and not seen the true value of them.”\n\nThe concept of natsukashii is, ultimately, a reflection of how ingrained gratitude is as a value in Japanese society. The past, whether it’s full of joy or pain, is valuable. It is to be remembered and appreciated. It should comfort us. It should strengthen our relationships. As Kawakami told me, “Sharing something precious from the past can connect me, as a person, to others.”\n\nWeeks after my obaachan passed away, my family sifted through her belongings and found a small notebook containing beautiful sketches of flowers and trees. It also included meticulous notes about their characteristics.\n\n“Did you know that obaachan used to take me on walks in the summer and teach me the names of all the flowers?” I asked my mother after examining several of the journal entries.\n\nMy mother, who has an aversion to Japan’s relentlessly hot summers, replied in amusement, “Kurushisou [seems painful].”\n\n“It was. We would drink mugicha afterwards though,” I replied.\n\nMy mother laughed with delight. “Mugicha in the summertime!” she cried. “Natsukashii.”\n\nWhy We Are What We Are is a BBC Travel series examining the characteristics of a country and investigating whether they are true.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or \n\nIf you liked this story, com features newsletter called \"The Essential List\".

    "description": "My partner and I spent 10 days in Japan seeing spots like Kyoto and Tokyo. Planning mistakes, like visiting in September, made our trip worse.",
    "fullText": "When my boyfriend and I planned a 10-day trip to Japan, we had no idea what to expect.\n\nAlthough we've traveled around the world together, it was our first time visiting the country. Upon landing, everything felt completely foreign — it was evident I was far from home.\n\nFortunately, we found Japan to be fun and easy to navigate as foreigners. With translation apps and a little bit of research, the majority of our trip went by without a hitch.\n\nEven still, we made a few mistakes that put a damper on our vacation. Here are a few things we'd do differently to make our next trip even better if we go back to Japan.\n\nThough this isn't the most crowded time to visit the country, the weather was far from ideal.\n\nMost days, the temperature hovered around 93 degrees Fahrenheit which, combined with 98% humidity and no breeze, left us miserable in the oppressive heat.\n\nWeather is hard to predict, but I wish we'd booked our trip just a month or two later. After all, October and November tend to be cooler in Japan.\n\nThe heat took away from our enjoyment of Japan's sites, whether the astonishing Osaka Castle or Tokyo's Sensō-ji Buddhist Temple.\n\nThe best thing we did was book accommodation with laundry services. We sweat through at least two outfits a day, so having easy access to laundry was a lifesaver.\n\nThere's little space for non-essentials in Japan's densely populated cities — especially bulky luggage.\n\nMy boyfriend and I each traveled with a large suitcase, but this was inconvenient. Not only is there limited bag space on the trains, but also doors open and close quickly. If you don't get all your luggage on board in time, you and your bags will be left on the platform.\n\nNext time, we'd use one of Japan's luggage delivery services. For a nominal fee, these services deliver your bags to and from the airport and from hotel to hotel throughout the country.\n\nWe didn't know about this service before our trip, but it would've made a huge difference on travel days.\n\nWhen I travel, I'm far from a planner — on most trips, I do very little research in advance. Sometimes, I don't even know where I'm sleeping the following evening when I wake up in the morning.\n\nShortly after arriving in Japan, however, we quickly realized we should've done more planning before boarding our flights.\n\nJapanese cities like Tokyo felt overwhelming in a way I've never experienced elsewhere. The sheer number of people, restaurants, skyscrapers, and things to do was mind-boggling.\n\nWe were struck with choice overload around every corner. As a result, we missed out on several experiences due to poor planning.\n\nI would've loved visiting Kinkaku-ji Temple in Kyoto — a UNESCO World Heritage Site — but I didn't learn about it until my last evening in the city.\n\nLikewise, watching a Sumo tournament in Osaka would have been fascinating, but our short stay didn't offer enough time to attend.\n\nIf we return to Japan, I'd like to to come equipped with a list of a few must-visit stops and experiences we'd like to check off.",

In 2010, China held back exports following an incident near disputed islands in the East China Sea.\n\nSince then, Japan has reduced its reliance on China to 60% from 90% by investing in overseas projects like trading house Sojitz's tie-up with Australia's Lynas Rare Earths, and promoting rare-earths recycling and manufacturing processes that rely less on ​the minerals.\n\nThe Minamitori Island project, however, is the first to attempt to source rare earths domestically.\n\n\"The fundamental solution is to be able to produce rare earths inside Japan,\" said ‌Takahide Kiuchi, executive economist at Nomura Research Institute.\n\n\"If this new round of export controls ends up covering a lot of rare earths, Japanese companies will again make efforts to move away from China, but I don’t think it will be easy,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING (AP) — A week in which longtime tensions between neighbors China and Japan ratcheted up economically and politically drew to a close with no sign of improvements Friday as the Chinese ambassador in Tokyo rebuffed his host nation and the Japanese reported delayed shipments to suppliers in China because of the spat.\n\nThe two developments capped a week where China made clear its displeasure with Japan by instituting new export controls, condemning what it called Tokyo's renewed militarism and cozying up to another regional neighbor, South Korea, during its leader's visit to Beijing.\n\nOn Friday, the Chinese Communist Party's flagship newspaper, People's Daily, kept the jabs coming.\n\n“New militarism will lead Japan back into the abyss,” it said in an editorial. “History serves as a stark warning, yet the Japanese right wing is repeating its old tricks.”\n\nIt was the latest in several days of pointed Chinese criticism toward Japan after its prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, suggested in November that she wouldn't rule out intervening if China used military force against the island of Taiwan. China views self-governed Taiwan as its sovereign territory and has said it would take it by force if needed. It staged large-scale military exercises nearby late last month.\n\nChina keeps its export controls\n\nOn Thursday night, the Chinese embassy in Japan said it had rejected a petition from Japan's Foreign Ministry to retract the new export controls on “dual-use items” that the Japanese military might be able to use in weaponry. The ambassador, Wu Jianghao, insisted that China's move was “entirely legitimate, reasonable and lawful” — and vital to national security.\n\nAlso Friday, Japanese officials said they are closely watching if Japanese exports of agricultural, fisheries and other goods are appropriately handled by China without delays. The Japanese news agency Kyodo reported that outgoing shipments of sake and processed food from Japan to China were being held up because of the diplomatic tensions, widening the ripples of the dispute.\n\nOfficials at the government-affiliated Japan External Trade Organization told The Associated Press that the shipments had been delayed in customs on the China side starting in late November. Kyodo, quoting trade industry sources, said they believed sake may have been targeted as “a symbol of Japan.”\n\nJapan’s chief cabinet secretary, Minoru Kihara, said he was aware of reports that some of the Japanese exports to China have been held up. He wouldn’t comment on individual commercial transactions.\n\n“It is important that agricultural, fisheries and other exports from Japan are smoothly carried out,” Kihara said. “We will closely watch the situation and take appropriate measures.” He didn’t say what those might be.\n\nJapan and China have a fraught history haunted by the Japanese colonization of Taiwan in 1895. The nations have fought two wars, and the imperial government in Tokyo brutally occupied parts of China in the first half of the 20th century. The countries maintain diplomatic relations and work closely together on many fronts but occasionally use government apparatus to condemn each other when disputes arise.\n\nChina's choice of wording in the People's Daily editorial and other rhetoric was noteworthy. It avoided casting a broad brush on the Japanese people and specifically targeted the country's right wing, which Takaichi belongs to. A report Thursday about Japan's nuclear ambitions repeatedly mentioned the right wing, and the People's Daily editorial beseeched the “peace-loving Japanese people” to be “highly vigilant” toward their government.\n\n\"Japan’s future lies not in the dangerous fantasies painted by the right wing, but in the thorough reckoning with its history of aggression,\" People's Daily said.\n\nRare earths as a pressure point\n\nKihara, the government spokesman, said Chinese export controls of rare earths already in place have caused “serious impact on global supply chains.” “We believe that international trade of rare earths should be carried out smoothly,\" Kihara said.\n\nIndustry and Trade Minister Ryosei Akazawa did not confirm whether China’s dual-use goods ban included new action on rare earths. Azakawa said the impact on Japanese industries is already significant because about 70% of rare earths, used in a wide range of products such as electronic parts and autos, are imported from China.\n\n“Rare earths are extremely important minerals, and the export controls have already affected our country tremendously,” Akazawa said. He wouldn't comment on whether Japan would consider retaliating.\n\nChina also pointedly expressed positive feelings about South Korea during the visit this week of its president, Lee Jae Myung, who met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. After the signing of millions in new export contracts, Lee heralded “a new chapter in the development of Korea-China relations.\"\n\nAs he visited, Chinese state media — which recently warned that travel to Japan by Chinese citizens might be dangerous — provided splashy coverage and said outgoing Chinese traveler to South Korea during New Year's had surpassed those to Japan.\n\nRelations between Beijing and Tokyo showed at least one tiny positive sign Friday. At a Foreign Ministry briefing in Beijing, spokesperson Mao Ning was informed that a one-time Japanese ambassador to China had died. She expressed the country's condolences.",

Tokyo is barreling forward with efforts to significantly boost its military capabilities to stand up to China’s growing threats by doubling annual arms spending.\n\nLast week, China launched large-scale military drills around Taiwan for two days to warn against what it calls separatist and external forces.\n\nAt that time, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi slammed both Japan and Taiwan’s “pro-independence forces.” Wang said Japan's current leaders openly challenge China’s territorial sovereignty and the postwar international order. Japan was defeated in World War II by the United States and its allies.\n\nIn his meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung in Beijing on Monday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping mentioned China’s and South Korea’s historical rivalry against Japan, calling on the two countries to “join hands to defend the fruits of victory in World War II and safeguard peace and stability in northeast Asia.”",

    "fullText": "TOKYO (AP) — Japan is barreling forward with efforts to significantly boost its military capabilities to stand up to China’s growing threats by doubling annual arms spending. The goal comes as Tokyo’s main ally, the United States, pushes for more military assistance in Asia and a military hawk and ultra-conservative takes over Japan's leadership.\n\nJapan says it is still a peaceful nation and the buildup is necessary for a more self-reliant military that can better deter China. But Beijing and other critics see Japan as deviating from its postwar peace pledge, pointing to Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's statement soon after taking office that any Chinese military action against Taiwan could be grounds for a Japanese military response.\n\nJapan’s transformation into one of the world’s major defense spenders has developed over decades and raises the question of whether the ongoing buildup is a violation of its pacifist constitution.\n\nJapan’s constitution has been hollowed out\n\nAfter World War II, Japan was not supposed to have a military.\n\nDuring the 1945-1952 U.S. occupation, American officials wanted to stamp out the militarism that led to Japanese aggression across Asia before and during the war.\n\nUnder Article 9 of the U.S.-drafted 1947 constitution, Japan renounced the use of force to settle international disputes, and the right to maintain land, sea and air forces for that purpose.\n\nThe U.S. changed its mind about Japanese militarism when the Korean War started in 1950. Japan became an ally, not a threat, leading to the creation of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces in 1954. Article 9 is now widely seen as the legal basis for Japan to have a sufficient military to defend itself.\n\nJapan has since repeatedly stretched the definition of self-defense, allowing overseas dispatches of its troops as part of international peacekeeping operations, though mostly avoiding combat missions.\n\nA big change came in 2014, under former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who wanted Japan to have a normal military. Abe newly interpreted Article 9 as legalizing collective defense. The following year, a security law allowed Japan to use force if the United States or other friendly nations come under enemy attack, even if Japan is not being attacked.\n\nThis was Abe’s attempt to have a normal military without formally changing the constitution.\n\nTakaichi angered China by giving a hypothetical example of such a situation, a deviation from former leaders’ strategic ambiguity.\n\nThe flap with Beijing escalated in December when Chinese aircraft locked their radars, considered possible preparation for firing missiles, on Japanese planes during Chinese aircraft carrier drills near southwestern Japan.\n\nTwo Chinese aircraft carriers also were spotted in June operating near the southern Japanese island of Iwo Jima for the first time. This led to worry in Tokyo about Beijing’s rapidly expanding military activity far beyond its borders and in areas around islands claimed by both countries.\n\nTakaichi’s Cabinet last week approved a record defense budget plan. It exceeds 9 trillion yen ($58 billion) for the coming year and aims to fortify its strike-back capability and coastal defense with cruise missiles and unmanned arsenals.\n\nIn Beijing later that day, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian criticized the Takaichi government for accelerating the pace of its military buildup and expansion, and added: “Japan is deviating from the path of peaceful development it has long claimed to uphold and is moving further and further in a dangerous direction.”\n\nChina, which spends a huge amount on its own defense, may also see Takaichi as a defender of Japanese wartime aggression. Before taking office, she was a regular at Tokyo’s Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japan’s 2.5 million war dead, including convicted war criminals. Victims of Japanese aggression, especially China and the Koreas, see visits to the shrine as tantamount to a lack of remorse about Japan’s wartime past.\n\nTakaichi stayed away from Yasukuni in 2025 and sent a religious ornament marking the Aug. 15 anniversary of Japan’s defeat as a personal gesture instead of praying at the shrine.\n\nJapan takes on more offensive roles\n\nA fundamental change came in December 2022 when former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s government adopted a security strategy stating the need for Japan to acquire strike-back capability with long-range missiles, a major break from Japan’s self-defense-only policy.\n\nThe strategy names China as Japan’s biggest strategic challenge and calls for a more offensive role for Japanese troops under its security alliance with the U.S as the allies work more closely together.\n\nMasahiro Sakata, former head of the Cabinet Legislative Bureau, described the move as “the death of Article 9.”\n\nAfter the war, Japan long prioritized economic development over defense while relying largely on the U.S. by hosting about 50,000 American troops who also serve the region.\n\nJapan maintained a defense spending cap of 1% of GDP until the annual defense budget started to rise under Abe’s nearly decade-long leadership, to about 1.1%. Takaichi is certain to achieve a 2% target by March, two years earlier than planned, and is expected to push for more spending in coming years as Japan is under growing pressure after NATO adopted a new target of 5%.\n\nJapan plans to promote defense industry\n\nTakaichi’s revised security and defense policy would aim to further bolster Japan with unmanned combative weapons and long-range missiles. It is expected to scrap remaining restrictions on arms exports to promote the development of Japan’s defense industry and cooperation with friendly nations.\n\nJapan has long banned arms exports but has significantly eased restrictions in recent years and is now developing next-generation fighter jets with the UK and Italy while finalizing a deal to sell frigates to Australia. Japan also will to provide support for construction and maintenance for U.S. warships.\n\nA government-commissioned panel has proposed Japan consider developing a nuclear submarine to achieve a more long-distance deterrence capability, a controversial idea for a country that has long maintained non-nuclear principles.\n\nJapan has requested Washington ensure protection through the extended deterrence of nuclear weapons. A number of officials recently expressed support for Japan’s nuclear possession, which has led to criticism from Japanese atomic bomb survivors and other pacifist groups.\n\nJapan stands by its three non-nuclear principles of not possessing, not producing and not allowing its presence, according to Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, although he said Japan is considering all options for a possible new submarine.",

    "fullText": "SHANGHAI - Japanese-themed manga and anime have been barred from one of China's largest comic conventions about a week before the show begins in late December, Hong Kong media reported, amid a continuing diplomatic row between Tokyo and Beijing.\n\nThe decision was notified to participants last Friday ahead of the two-day Comicup convention scheduled to be held next weekend in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou near Shanghai, according to the South China Morning Post.\n\nExhibitors and visitors were informed by the event's organizers that there would be a \"full-scale adjustment\" of content toward \"a new Chinese style\" theme across the venue due to the \"current social environment and our cultural obligations,\" the Hong Kong newspaper said Tuesday.\n\nThe exhibition areas themed around American and European content did not seem to be affected at the event featuring some 7,000 booths, which has become a massive marketplace for creators of derivative works based on various anime, comics, and game fan groups, according to the report.\n\nWhile the notification did not name Japan, several dozen exhibitors featuring Japanese anime and other themed content said on social media that their booths had been cancelled for reasons \"well-known to all\" and \"factors beyond control,\" the SCMP said.\n\nA similar comic convention held in Shanghai in October drew hundreds of thousands of visitors. The paper quoted a woman whose booth was supposed to have featured artwork of the Japanese manga \"Let's Go Karaoke!\" as saying, \"I am feeling utterly helpless and sad.\"\n\nThe ongoing dispute between the two Asian neighbors stems from Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's parliamentary remarks last month that suggested an attack on Taiwan could constitute a \"survival-threatening situation\" for Japan, prompting possible involvement of the Self-Defense Forces.\n\nBeijing has since ramped up its retaliatory measures, including urging its citizens not to visit Japan, suspending seafood imports from the neighboring country and canceling cultural events featuring Japanese artists.\n\nMeanwhile, manga and animation events scheduled for January in such Chinese cities as Shenzhen in Guangdong Province and Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province were postponed due to \"force majeure,\" according to organizers.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Cassi Zheng, 31, the founder of Aurawell, an aromatherapy brand. Her words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAs a brand director at a sports-drink startup in Shanghai, I spoke to more than 30 people a day — from members of the sports community to suppliers and colleagues seeking sign-offs.\n\nI was drained. I felt chronic pain, constant fatigue, and even had panic attacks.\n\nIn February 2023, at 29, I quit. I wanted to head into my 30s with a clearer sense of purpose. I didn't tell my parents, but my friends and colleagues were supportive.\n\nSuddenly, I had nothing to do, and that early idleness felt panic-inducing. I was so used to running around, talking to people, and being needed. I felt completely lost for a few days.\n\nThen I started trying different things. I biked across the city from one end to the other, covering more than 10 kilometers. Another time, I biked 30 kilometers just to go kayaking.\n\nI felt exhausted, but also energized.\n\nI spent the first year traveling across Asia. Because I'd been practicing Reiki, Japan felt like a natural first stop.\n\nOn a trip to Tokyo and Kyoto with friends, temples and traditional inns sparked something within me. I knew I wanted to go back again on my own.\n\nI kept moving. Bangkok's flea markets and Chinatown reminded me of Guangzhou, where I grew up, in the '90s.\n\nIn South Korea, I rang in the new year on Jeju Island with old friends, racing to find a taxi minutes before midnight.\n\nOn New Year's Day, I flew to Kyoto for my first true solo trip. I'd lived on my own before — college and grad school in the US, travel through Mexico, Kenya, Nepal — but Japan felt different. It was the perfect place to be an introvert.\n\nI spent my birthday alone in Tokyo, sick with the flu, wandering the Nezu Museum's gardens. The quiet design reminded me to notice what's present, instead of what's missing.\n\nI returned to Japan twice more that year, spending days meditating alone in the mountains.\n\nA year and a half after quitting, I spent three weeks in Europe. On a hike in Sicily, I met a man climbing beside me. He spoke Italian, I spoke English, but we managed. He told me his father had paved the mountain road. Afterward, I visited his café.\n\nSicily felt open and passionate — a contrast to Shanghai's intensity.\n\nI began crying without knowing why and felt ashamed. I tried to step away, but the teacher told me I didn't need to hide. With an East Asian upbringing, that was incredibly freeing. I cried for two days, overwhelmed by release.\n\nI'd long relied on external validation from bosses, parents, and goal-driven metrics. My gap year loosened that grip. I could count the trips or the solo days, but none of that defines me.\n\nOn my 30th birthday, I finally told my parents about my gap year and the aromatherapy brand I was starting with a friend. They were shocked — it was far outside their comfort zone — but showing them my business plan and prototypes helped. Even now, when I visit them a few hours outside Shanghai, they enjoy talking about metrics and the future of my company.\n\nMy friend and I launched Aurawell in May 2024, just over a year after I left my job. I first got the word out by leading a public meditation in an underground performance space.\n\nTaking a gap year was one of the wisest decisions I've made. It gave me time to slow down, reflect on my choices, and discover what I actually enjoy, without pressure from the outside world.\n\nDo you have a story about taking a gap year that you want to share?

    "fullText": "TOKYO (AP) — Thousands of people flocked to Tokyo's Ueno zoo to have a last glimpse of the popular twin pandas that are set to return to China next month, worried if or when they get to see their replacement in Japan as Tokyo's relations with Beijing sunk.\n\nThe Tokyo metropolitan government announced Monday that Xiao Xiao and his sister Lei Lei will return to China in late January and that their last day of public viewing will be Jan. 25.\n\nTheir departure will leave Japan without a panda for the first time in more than half a century. Prospects for their replacement are not favorable as ties between the two countries have plunged in recent weeks.\n\nGiant pandas are native to southwestern China and serve as an unofficial national mascot. Beijing lends them to other countries as a sign of goodwill but maintains ownership over them and any cubs they produce.\n\nYuki Imai, a panda fan visiting from the neighboring Kanagawa prefecture, said she was shocked by the news of the twins' return and decided to visit. “I thought I should come and see them soon while I still can.”\n\nMany queued for more than two hours to get to see the twins for one minute. Kazuhiro Yamamoto said he came to see the pandas with his wife Hiroko “for the one last time,” and that the twins may be returning sooner due to the rocky relations.\n\nThe four-year-old twins were born at Tokyo's Ueno Zoological Gardens in June, 2021, and raised there, but they remain on loan from China and must be returned by February.\n\nRelations between Japan and China have worsened since Japan’s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in early November that its military could get involved if China were to impose a naval blockade or other action against Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its own.\n\nChina has since restricted tourism to Japan, and cultural events and exchanges between local governments have been canceled.\n\nThe row escalated this month when Chinese drills involving an aircraft carrier near southern Japan prompted Tokyo to scramble fighter jets. Japan also protested that its aircraft were targeted by repeated radar-locking — a move considered as possible preparation for missile firing.\n\nTadashi Nakatani, a 51-year-old calligrapher at a temple who regularly visits from his hometown of Kamakura, west of Tokyo, said international relations may affect the panda diplomacy, but he has hope.\n\n“When things calm down and the relationship becomes stable, I sincerely hope that pandas will come again, and that a day will come when everyone can enjoy seeing them again.”\n\nChina sent the first pair of pandas to Japan in 1972 to mark the normalization of diplomatic ties between the two countries. Since then, Japan has never been left without a panda.\n\nThousands of visitors formed a long line outside the zoo Tuesday morning. During their one-minute viewing time at the panda zone, visitors called out the twins’ names and took photos or videos as the pair nibbled bamboo sticks or strolled around.\n\nBeginning next week, only up to 4,800 visitors who successfully booked their 1-minute slot online will be able to see the beloved twins, according to the zoo.\n\nJapan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said Monday that pandas have long been loved by Japanese people and he hoped the friendship through panda diplomacy between the two countries will continue.\n\n“Exchanges through pandas have contributed to improve the public sentiment between Japan and China, and we hope the relationship will continue,” Kihara said. He noted that a number of local municipalities and zoos have expressed hope that new pandas will be loaned out soon.\n\nUeno Zoological Gardens curator Hitoshi Suzuki, referring to the panda twins, said raising them in good health was challenging. “But they gave us many kinds of joy and surprise. They also brought great delight to our visitors. We have nothing but words of gratitude.”\n\nThe zoo plans to promote other animals to make up for the absence of the pandas, while waiting for their replacement. “We will keep the panda area for the time being, so that we can accommodate possible new arrivals at any time.”",

    "fullText": "TOKYO (AP) — Popular twin pandas at a Tokyo zoo are set to return to their homeland in China in late January, officials said Monday, leaving Japan without a panda for the first time in about half a century.\n\nProspects for their replacement are not favorable either as ties between the two countries have deteriorated.\n\nThe twins, Xiao Xiao and his sister Lei Lei, were born at Tokyo's Ueno Zoological Gardens in 2021, and raised, but they remain on loan from China and have to be returned by February.\n\nTheir parents Shin Shin and Ri Ri returned home last year after China loaned them for breeding research in 2011.\n\nThe last day of public viewing for the 4-year-old twins will be Jan. 25, according to the Tokyo metropolitan government.\n\nJapan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said pandas have long been loved by Japanese people and he hoped friendship through panda diplomacy between the two countries will continue.\n\n“Exchanges through pandas have contributed to improve the public sentiment between Japan and China, and we hope the relationship will continue,” Kihara said. He noted that a number of local municipalities and zoos have expressed hope that new pandas will to be loaned soon.\n\nChina sent the first pair of pandas to Japan in 1972 to mark the normalization of diplomatic ties between the two countries. Since then, Japan has never been left without a panda.\n\nGiant pandas are native to southwestern China and serve as an unofficial national mascot. Beijing lends them to other countries as a sign of goodwill but maintains ownership over them and any cubs they produce.\n\nRelations between Japan and China have worsened since Japan’s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in early November that its military could get involved if China were to take action against Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its own.\n\nChina has since restricted tourism to Japan, and cultural events and exchanges between local governments have been canceled. The row escalated this month when Chinese drills involving an aircraft carrier near southern Japan prompted Tokyo to scramble fighter jets. It also protested that Japanese aircraft were targeted by repeated radar-locking — a move considered as possible preparation for missile firing.",

It's hard to put into words how different my life is now. It's very busy, but it was one of the most enjoyable times ever,\" reflected O'Connor in an interview with BBC Sport NI's Thomas Kane.\n\n\"I could never have predicted this all to happen. I know I've always put in a lot of work, but this year was just a completely different level.\n\n\"To win one medal was insane. To win two was crazy.

    "fullText": "A United Airlines flight bound for Tokyo was forced to return to Washington Dulles International Airport on Saturday after losing power in one of its engines shortly after takeoff, triggering a brush fire on the ground and prompting a federal investigation. The Boeing 777-200 was carrying 275 passengers when the incident occurred, according to the airline.\n\nUnited Flight 803 departed Dulles around 12:35 p.m. en route to Tokyo’s Haneda Airport. After the engine issue was detected, the aircraft circled the area for just under an hour before landing safely back at Dulles. United said there were eight crew members aboard and no injuries were reported.\n\nU.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy said in a post on X that a piece of the jet’s engine cover broke off after takeoff, sparking a brush fire near the runway. He added that the Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the incident.\n\nI've been briefed on United Flight 803 from Dulles to Japan. \n\nHere’s what we know:\n -An engine failed on the Boeing 777-200ER shortly after take-off\n -275 passengers, 15 crew members on board\n -A piece of the engine cover separated and caught fire, sparking a brush fire on… https://t.co/IxkFJU2Fes\n\n— Secretary Sean Duffy (@SecDuffy) December 13, 2025\n\nEmily McGee, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, said the fire was quickly extinguished and that airport fire and rescue crews evaluated the aircraft after it returned. Smoke from the brush fire was visible across the tarmac as other flights continued arriving and departing.\n\nThe incident briefly disrupted operations at Dulles and drew the attention of passengers across the airport.\n\nHouman David Hemmati, a California-based ophthalmologist, was seated on a separate United flight bound for Los Angeles when his pilot announced a ground stop.\n\n“We are on a ground stop,” the pilot told passengers, Hemmati said. “There’s an incident on the runway.”\n\nLooking out his window, Hemmati said he saw thick smoke rising near the runway, illuminated by flashing emergency vehicles. He took photos and posted on X, writing, “Praying it’s not a crash.”\n\nHemmati’s flight was later diverted to another runway and allowed to depart around 1 p.m. As the plane climbed, he said smoke was still visible below.\n\nCommercial aircraft are designed to fly safely on a single engine, particularly during critical phases like takeoff. Pilots train extensively for engine failures, and standard protocol typically calls for returning to the departure airport when a problem occurs shortly after liftoff.\n\nKey details from the incident include:\n\nFlight: United Airlines Flight 803\n\nPassengers: 275 passengers and eight crew members\n\nIssue: Loss of power in one engine after takeoff\n\nGround impact: Engine cover debris sparked a brush fire\n\nOutcome: Safe return to Dulles with no reported injuries\n\nNext step: FAA investigation underway\n\nUnited praised the response of its crews and airport personnel in a statement released Saturday.\n\n“United is grateful to our crews and to the teams at Washington Dulles for their quick work to help ensure the safety of everyone involved,” the airline said. United added that it is working to rebook passengers on a later flight.\n\nThe FAA has not released details on what caused the engine cover to detach or whether the aircraft had any prior maintenance issues. Investigators are expected to examine flight data, maintenance records, and debris from the engine as part of the inquiry.\n\nThe Boeing 777 remains one of the most widely used wide-body aircraft in international travel, but any engine-related issue shortly after takeoff draws immediate scrutiny from regulators.\n\nFor passengers aboard Flight 803, the incident ended without injury but with a tense delay to an already long journey. For United and federal investigators, the focus now turns to determining what failed and whether any broader inspections are needed.\n\nThe FAA’s findings will ultimately determine whether the incident was an isolated mechanical failure or part of a larger concern.",
