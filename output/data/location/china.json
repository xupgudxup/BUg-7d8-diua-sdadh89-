    "fullText": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said it's \"naive\" to think the US will shift away from China.\n\n\"The idea of decoupling for whatever reason, philosophical reasons or national security reasons, it's not based on any common sense,\" Huang said during an episode of the \"No Priors\" podcast posted on Thursday.\n\nHuang, whose company is eagerly awaiting the ability to sell advanced chips in China again, praised President Donald Trump's approach to navigating the relationship between the world's two largest economies.\n\n\"I am optimistic that our relationship with China will improve, that President Trump and the administration has a really, really grounded and common-sense attitude and philosophy around how to think about China, that they're an adversary, but they're also a partner in many ways, and that the idea of decoupling is naive.\"\n\nNvidia may soon be returning to the lucrative Chinese market, which Huang once estimated could be worth $50 billion a year.\n\nBloomberg reported on Thursday that China planned to approve some sales of Nvidia's H200 chips \"as soon as this quarter.\" In December, Trump lifted a Biden-era policy that effectively banned Nvidia from selling its older H200 in China, provided the US government gets a 25% cut on future sales. Huang has repeatedly said that the US will not slow down China's AI advancements by curtailing the sales of advanced chips.\n\nHuang said on Tuesday that he was not expecting a formal announcement from Beijing approving the sales of H200 chips. China previously imposed its restrictions on such sales.\n\n\"We're not expecting any press releases, or any large declarations,\" Huang said during a news conference on the sidelines of CES in Las Vegas. \"It's just going to be purchase orders.\"\n\nAs for the broader US-China relationship, Huang said that both nations ought to continue to invest in their own independence. Trump has deployed a combination of tariffs and incentives to encourage US-based companies to bring their manufacturing back to the US.\n\n\"When you depend too much on someone, the relationship becomes too emotional, as you know,\" Huang said. \"And so it's good to have some independence or there as much independence as either would like, but to recognize that there's a lot of coupling, a lot of dependence between the two countries. And I think there needs to be a nuanced strategy, a nuanced attitude about how to manage this relationship in a productive way for all of the people of two countries and for all of the people around the world.\"\n\nThe world needs both sides to figure it out, Huang said.\n\n\"Everybody depends on a productive, constructive relationship of the two most important nations and the single most important relationship for the next century,\" he said. \"And so we have to find that answer.\"",

    "description": "When it comes to claiming that Venezuelan oil is now under his control, President Donald Trump is mincing no words.  After all, Trump is expected to visit Beijing in April as part of an effort to protect the fragile trade truce he reached with Chinese President Xi Jinping late last year.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — When it comes to claiming that Venezuelan oil is now under his control, President Donald Trump is mincing no words. But no small part of that oil belongs to China under contracts it struck with Caracas years ago, setting the stage for a delicate diplomatic dance in the next few weeks.\n\nSome experts expect Trump to work with China in an effort to stabilize trade relations. After all, Trump is expected to visit Beijing in April as part of an effort to protect the fragile trade truce he reached with Chinese President Xi Jinping late last year.\n\n“The administration appears focused on avoiding unnecessary escalation or new irritants with Beijing while keeping leverage firmly on Washington’s terms,” said Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nHe added that he doubted Trump would risk turning Venezuela into a “flashpoint that complicates trade dynamics or Trump’s personal engagement with Xi.”\n\nChina is owed at least $10 billion from Venezuela, according to various estimates, a debt that former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro had paid down by shipping oil to China. It is possible that the interim Venezuelan government complying with Washington’s demands could question the legality of those loans-for-oil deals and cease payments.\n\nTwo major Chinese state-owned enterprises — China National Petroleum Corp. and Sinopec — are entitled to 4.4 billion barrels of oil reserves in Venezuela, the highest for any foreign country, according to a research note by the investment bank Morgan Stanley.\n\nU.S. companies also have claims for tens of billions of dollars from when Caracas nationalized the oil industry, and it’s not clear how these IOUs will be honored and in what order.\n\nThe U.S. seized two sanctioned oil tankers this week as part of a plan to assert control over Venezuelan oil shipments. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the U.S. will handle the sales of Venezuela’s oil “indefinitely,” depositing proceeds into U.S.-controlled accounts that will ultimately “flow back into Venezuela to benefit the Venezuelan people.”\n\nThe administration said this week that the U.S. would kickstart those sales with 30 million to 50 million barrels taken from the South American country’s crude storage facilities. Asked for more detail, a Trump administration official not authorized to comment publicly and speaking on condition of anonymity said U.S. policy was to wind down “adversarial outside influence” in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe U.S. using such leverage over a crucial natural resource comes after Beijing flexed its muscles last year by choking off critical supplies of rare-earth magnets and weaponizing its purchase of American soybeans in the trade war with Washington. When Trump met Xi in South Korea in October, the two men agreed to a one-year truce, backing off from sky-high tariffs and export controls on each other.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2023, Venezuela was the fourth-largest recipient of Beijing's official credit, having received $106 billion worth of loans from China’s official-sector creditors, according to AidData, a research lab at Virginia's College of William & Mary that tracks Beijing's overseas lending activities. But how much of the total that Caracas has paid off and what is still owed is unclear, said AidData executive director Brad Parks, because Caracas stopped reporting debt details several years ago.\n\nWhile some estimates put the outstanding debt at $10 billion, Parks said the figure could be much higher because U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan oil might have delayed loan repayments. The loans from China, under an unusual arrangement, were set up to be paid down with proceeds from oil exports.\n\nIn China, the capture of Maduro evoked memories of another leader who had struck deals with Chinese companies and then suddenly lost power: Libya's Moammar Gadhafi.\n\nAfter the 2011 fall of Gadhafi, Chinese businesses had to leave behind billions in investments. Cui Shoujun, professor of international studies at Renmin University in Beijing, told the Chinese news and commentary site guancha.cn that the transition government in Caracas could deem agreements under Maduro unlawful and the debt to China illegal.\n\nAs in Libya, Beijing’s stakes in Venezuela have gone beyond oil. Chinese firms have invested in telecommunications, railways and ports in Venezuela, all now at risk, according to a report by the global financial firm Jefferies.\n\nStill, the firm noted that Beijing will likely manage any disruption because Venezuelan oil counted for only a small percentage of China's oil imports and because Beijing has diversified its energy supplies and pivoted to electrification.\n\nHours before he was captured by U.S. forces, Maduro hosted a high-level Chinese diplomat at the presidential palace and praised the countries' ties that had prospered from the days of his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, and given Beijing a strong foothold in America's backyard.\n\nVenezuela is the only Latin American country that has a high-level strategic partnership with China, on par with close friends like Pakistan, and the ouster of Maduro is expected to curtail China's influence in the Western Hemisphere — in line with one of the goals spelled out in the Trump administration's National Security Strategy.\n\nBeijing's response to the capture of Maduro\n\nSoon after Maduro was captured, Beijing said it was “deeply shocked” by the blatant use of U.S. force against a sovereign state and action against its president and said it “strongly” condemned the U.S. actions. It called for the immediate release of Maduro and his wife.\n\nChinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong said Thursday that no nation has the right to interfere with economic and trade cooperation between China and Venezuela, which he said is between two sovereign states and protected by international and domestic laws.\n\n“No matter how the political situation in Venezuela evolves, China’s willingness to deepen bilateral economic and trade cooperation will not change,” He said.\n\nSingleton said Beijing does not wield the clout in the Western Hemisphere as touted.\n\n“Beijing can protest diplomatically,” he said, “but it cannot protect partners or assets once Washington decides to apply direct pressure.”",

Xi invited Carney to China when they met during an Asia-Pacific summit in October. The visit comes as the two countries move to restore stronger ties after years of tensions.\n\n“We’re forging new partnerships around the world to transform our economy from one that has been reliant on a single trade partner, to one that is stronger and more resilient to global shock,” Carney said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nCarney will travel to China from Jan. 13 to 17. He will also attend the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland from Jan. 19 to 21.\n\nTrump has been threatening Canada’s economy and sovereignty with tariffs, most offensively by claiming Canada could be “the 51st state.”\n\nThe attempt at rapprochement with China comes as Carney looks to double Canada’s non-U.S. exports in the next decade and as the free trade agreement with the U.S. and Mexico is up for review this year. More than 75% percent of Canada’s exports go to the U.S.\n\nChina is Canada's second largest trading partner.\n\nRelations between China and Canada took a nosedive in late 2018 after Canadian authorities arrested a senior executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei as a part of its extradition agreement with the United States. China then arrested two Canadian citizens in retaliation.\n\nMore recently, relations have been shaken by Canada’s decision to levy a 100% tariff on electric vehicles, batteries and other goods from China in 2024. Canada made the move in tandem with the U.S.\n\nCanadian canola producers, seafood exporters and pork farmers are dealing with steep Chinese tariffs in retaliation.\n\nChina has offered to remove its import taxes on some Canadian products if Canada drops the EV tariff.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING (AP) — China escalated its trade tensions with Japan on Wednesday by launching an investigation into imported dichlorosilane, a chemical gas used in making semiconductors, a day after it imposed curbs on the export of so-called dual-use goods that could be used by Japan’s military.\n\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement that it had launched the investigation following an application from the domestic industry showing the price of dichlorosilane imported from Japan had decreased 31% between 2022 and 2024.\n\n“The dumping of imported products from Japan has damaged the production and operation of our domestic industry,” the ministry said.\n\nThe measure comes a day after Beijing banned exports to Japan of dual-use goods that can have military applications.\n\nBeijing has been showing mounting displeasure with Tokyo after new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested late last year that her nation's military could intervene if China were to take action against Taiwan — an island democracy that Beijing considers its own territory.\n\nTensions were stoked again on Tuesday when Japanese lawmaker Hei Seki, who last year was sanctioned by China for “spreading fallacies” about Taiwan and other disputed territories, visited Taiwan and called it an independent country. Also known as Yo Kitano, he has been banned from entering China. He told reporters that his arrival in Taiwan demonstrated the two are “different countries.”\n\n“I came to Taiwan … to prove this point, and to tell the world that Taiwan is an independent country,” Hei Seki said, according to Taiwan’s Central News Agency.\n\n“The nasty words of a petty villain like him are not worth commenting on,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning retorted when asked about his comment.\n\nMasaaki Kanai, head of Asia Oceanian Affairs at Japan's Foreign Ministry, urged China to scrap the trade curbs, saying a measure exclusively targeting Japan that deviates from international practice is unacceptable. Japan, however, has yet to announce any retaliatory measures.\n\nAs the two countries feuded, speculation rose that China might target rare earths exports to Japan, in a move similar to the rounds of critical minerals export restrictions it has imposed as part of its trade war with the United States.\n\nChina controls most of the global production of heavy rare earths, used for making powerful, heat-resistant magnets used in industries such as defense and electric vehicles.\n\nWhile the Commerce Ministry did not mention any new rare earths curbs, the official newspaper China Daily, seen as a government mouthpiece, quoted anonymous sources saying Beijing was considering tightening exports of certain rare earths to Japan. That report could not be independently confirmed.\n\nImproved South Korean ties contrast with Japan row\n\nAs Beijing spars with Tokyo, it has made a point of courting a different East Asian power — South Korea.\n\nOn Wednesday, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung wrapped up a four-day trip to China – his first since taking office in June. Lee and Chinese President Xi Jinping oversaw the signing of cooperation agreements in areas such as technology, trade, transportation and environmental protection.\n\nAs if to illustrate a contrast with the China-Japan trade frictions, Lee joined two business events at which major South Korean and Chinese companies pledged to collaborate.\n\nThe two sides signed 24 export contracts worth a combined $44 million, according to South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Resources.\n\nDuring Lee’s visit, Chinese media also reported that South Korea overtook Japan as the leading destination for outbound flights from China’s mainland over the New Year’s holiday.\n\nChina has been discouraging travel to Japan, saying Japanese leaders’ comments on Taiwan have created “significant risks to the personal safety and lives of Chinese citizens in Japan.”",

    "fullText": "STORY: :: China has 'made its point' after banning dual-use exports to Japan that could be used for military purposes:: Cameron Johnson, Senior Partner, Tidalwave Solutions\"What we're watching for really is, what is the next salvo? Does China really start to go after critical industries such as automotive, high-end technical industries, things like drones and other exports to Japan? At the moment, they haven't done that. There are some rumors. But the reality is I think China has really shown that it's serious, it's unhappy and it has made its point. There's no point in messing up business further.\"\"So at the moment I don't expect much reaction out of Japan, per se, particularly on industry. But if it gets more severe, if there are Japanese civilian or commercial entities targeted, you could see the Japanese retaliate particularly for example in semiconductors or other high-end manufacturing materials that China actually needs for its own supply chain. So at the moment that doesn't look like it's going happen, but if it gets more severe, you will start to see the Japanese and potentially other countries react negatively against Chinese interests.\"Johnson said the measure could slow Japanese industrial activity by restricting access to critical materials, forcing them to seek alternative suppliers.Japan's foreign ministry said on Wednesday it strongly protested the measures and demanded that China withdraw them. It called the move \"absolutely unacceptable and deeply regrettable\" and said the measures targeted only Japan and that they \"deviate significantly from international practice.\"Johnson said Japan is unlikely to respond immediately but could retaliate if restrictions intensify, adding that other countries could potentially follow suit.",

Kanai said a measure exclusively targeting Japan that deviates from international practice is unacceptable and demanded it be retracted.\n\nRelations between Japan and China worsened late last year after Japan’s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said its military could get involved if China were to take action against Taiwan.\n\nIn December, Japan said Chinese military aircraft locked radar on its fighter jets even though there was a safe distance between them. Tokyo is barreling forward with efforts to significantly boost its military capabilities to stand up to China’s growing threats by doubling annual arms spending.\n\nLast week, China launched large-scale military drills around Taiwan for two days to warn against what it calls separatist and external forces.\n\nAt that time, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi slammed both Japan and Taiwan’s “pro-independence forces.” Wang said Japan's current leaders openly challenge China’s territorial sovereignty and the postwar international order. Japan was defeated in World War II by the United States and its allies.\n\nIn his meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung in Beijing on Monday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping mentioned China’s and South Korea’s historical rivalry against Japan, calling on the two countries to “join hands to defend the fruits of victory in World War II and safeguard peace and stability in northeast Asia.”",

    "description": "Deal indicates Venezuelan government is responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention",
    "fullText": "Deal indicates Venezuelan government is responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention\n\nDonald Trump has said Venezuela will be “turning over” $2bn worth of Venezuelan crude to the United States, a flagship negotiation that would divert supplies from China while helping Venezuela avoid deeper oil production cuts.\n\n“This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!” Trump said in a post online.\n\nVenezuelan government officials and state company PDVSA did not provide comment.\n\nVenezuela has millions of barrels of oil loaded on tankers and in storage tanks that it has been unable to ship due to the blockade imposed by Trump, as part of the pressure campaign that culminated in the toppling of Nicolás Maduro who was seized from his country by US forces over the weekend.\n\nTop Venezuelan officials have called Maduro’s capture a kidnapping and accused the US of trying to steal the country’s vast oil reserver, however Tuesday’s agreement is a strong sign that the government is responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention.\n\nTrump has said he wants interim president Delcy Rodríguez to give the US and private companies “total access” to Venezuela’s oil industry.\n\nUS energy secretary Chris Wright is in charge of executing the deal, Trump said, adding that the oil will be taken from ships and sent directly to US ports. Supplying the trapped crude to the US could initially require reallocating cargoes originally bound for China, two sources had told Reuters earlier on Tuesday.\n\nChina has been Venezuela’s top buyer in the last decade and especially since the United States imposed sanctions on companies involved in oil trade with Venezuela in 2020.\n\nUS crude prices fell more than 1.5% after Trump’s announcement, with the agreement expected to increase the volume of Venezuelan oil exported to the US. That flow of oil is currently controlled entirely by Chevron, PDVSA’s main joint venture partner, under a US authorisation.\n\nChevron, which has been exporting between 100,000 and 150,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan oil to the US, is the only company that has been loading and shipping crude without interruption from the South American country in recent weeks under the blockade.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Venezuela would have any access to proceeds from the supply. Sanctions mean PDVSA is excluded from the global financial system, its bank accounts are frozen and it is blocked from executing transactions in US dollars\n\nHours before Trump’s announcement on Tuesday, Rodríguez hardened her tone against the US, saying in a televised address that “no external agent governs Venezuela” – a clear rebuttal to the US president’s claim that, after the capture of Maduro, the US would now run the South American country.\n\nIt marked another shift in tone from Maduro’s former vice-president. After being sworn in as president by Venezuela’s supreme court on Saturday, Rodríguez released a conciliatory statement late on Sunday in which she “invited the US government to work together on an agenda of cooperation”.\n\nIn Tuesday’s address, however, Rodríguez reverted to harsher language, describing Saturday’s strike – the first large-scale US military operation on South American soil – as a “terrible military aggression” and a “criminal attack” whose “absolutely illegal outcome, in violation of international law”, was the “kidnapping” of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.\n\n“We are a people who do not surrender, who do not give up, and we are here, governing together with the people. The government of Venezuela rules in our country – no one else. There is no external agent governing Venezuela. It is Venezuela, its constitutional government, and the consolidated power of the people,” said Rodríguez, who had served as Maduro’s vice-president since 2018.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk says China is on track to outpace every other country in the computing power needed to run AI.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO said in an episode of the \"Moonshots with Peter Diamandis\" podcast published Tuesday that \"China's going to have more power than anyone else and probably will have more chips.\"\n\n\"Based on current trends, China will far exceed the rest of the world in AI compute,\" he added.\n\nMusk said China's decisive advantage in the AI race lies in its ability to scale electricity generation. He estimated that China could reach about three times the electricity output of the US by 2026, giving it the capacity to support energy-hungry AI data centers.\n\nElectricity generation is the limiting factor to scaling AI systems, Musk said.\n\n\"People are underestimating the difficulty of bringing electricity online,\" he added.\n\nWhile the US has focused on restricting China's access to advanced semiconductors, Musk suggested those constraints may matter less over time. China will \"figure out the chips,\" he said.\n\nMusk added that diminishing returns at the cutting edge of chip performance might make it easier for China to catch up, even without access to the most advanced designs.\n\nMusk has previously pointed to China as a model in areas beyond AI infrastructure.\n\nIn an episode of the \"People by WTF\" podcast published in November, Musk said he wants to turn his social media platform X into \"WeChat++,\" referencing China's dominant super app.\n\n\"I also like the idea of sort of having a unified app or website or whatever, where you can do anything you want there,\" he said. \"China has this with WeChat.\"\n\nMusk's comments come as energy supply and data infrastructure emerge as key constraints in scaling AI, rather than chips or algorithms.\n\nCompanies worldwide have rushed to build AI data centers, many of which require as much electrical power as small cities.\n\nA report from Goldman Sachs in November said that an electricity shortage could slow US progress in the AI race.\n\n\"As AI demands massive power, a reliable and ample power supply is likely to be a key factor shaping this race, especially because power infrastructure bottlenecks can be slow to solve,\" wrote Goldman's analysts.\n\nThe report added that while pressure on the US power grid is increasing, China has been steadily expanding its energy capacity.\n\n\"We expect China's spare capacity to remain sufficient to accommodate data center power demand growth while supporting demand in other industries,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nIn his annual New Year's address last week, Chinese leader Xi Jinping praised his country's progress in AI in 2025, saying China had \"integrated science and technology deeply with industries, and made a stream of new innovations.\"\n\n\"Many large AI models have been competing in a race to the top, and breakthroughs have been achieved in the research and development of our own chips,\" he said in his speech in Beijing.\n\n\"All this has turned China into one of the economies with the fastest-growing innovation capabilities,\" he added.",

Without more exports, PDVSA could be forced to deepen production cuts it began in ‌recent days because storage tanks are full.\n\nChevron on Monday resumed exports of Venezuelan oil to the U.S. after a four-day pause and called workers abroad back to its Venezuelan offices as flights to the country restarted. The U.S. firm has emerged in recent weeks as the only company fluidly exporting Venezuela's crude.\n\nAt least a dozen vessels under sanctions that had loaded in December and had been stuck in Venezuela's waters due to the embargo sailed in ⁠early January.\n\nThose vessels were carrying around 12 million barrels of ​crude and fuel. It was unclear where the vessels were heading, ​although they were initially loaded for customers in China. The ships left in \"dark mode,\" which means that transponders that send out their location were switched off. The vessels appeared to break ‍the U.S. tanker blockade.\n\nThe U.S. ⁠government has not commented on the vessels or whether it authorized the departures. PDVSA has not replied to a request for comment. Chevron said this week it continues to operate \"in full compliance with all relevant ⁠laws and regulations.\"",

    "fullText": "Michael Burry says the US raid on Venezuela is a much bigger deal than the markets' muted reaction suggests.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame, who recently pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack, published a post early Monday saying the \"game just changed\" in the mid to long term, and \"markets are not pricing in all that may come of this weekend's events.\"\n\n\"This is a paradigm shift despite the markets yawning,\" he later wrote on X.\n\nBenchmark oil prices climbed less than 1% on Monday, and US stock futures opened higher, after the US captured President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend and President Trump said America would \"run\" the oil-rich country for the time being.\n\nThe seizure was a \"shot across China's bow,\" Burry wrote, pointing to billions of dollars in loans that China has made to Venezuela under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which were collateralized using future oil output that is \"now in US hands.\"\n\nThe investor, who shot to fame after his prescient bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble was featured in the book and movie \"The Big Short,\" wrote that China may now have a \"blueprint\" for how to take control of Taiwan, but \"must be in awe of Trumpian America's infuriating gall and decisive power.\"\n\nBurry said that China stocks strike him as \"somewhat riskier\" now in terms of running afoul of sanctions. He wrote that Alibaba, Baidu, and other potential sanction targets \"could be in for some volatility\" if China escalates its aggression in the South China Sea or targets Taiwan.\n\nThe contrarian bargain hunter also wrote that \"Putin's jaw has to be on the floor\" after the US did in \"practically seconds\" what Russia has been trying to do in Ukraine for three years.\n\nHe added that Russian oil \"just became less important\" in the mid to long term, as tapping Venezuelan oil could strengthen the US and \"reduce Russia's income and power.\"\n\nBurry also suggested that Canada and Mexico could \"lose a good amount of leverage\" in trade with the US if American refineries switch out Canadian crude for Venezuelan oil.\n\nThe veteran investor also said US oil-services companies such as Halliburton, Schlumberger, and Baker Hughes \"should benefit significantly\" as US contractors will be tasked with fixing and modernizing Venezuela's pipelines and refineries.\n\nBurry also forecast a \"long term tailwind\" for the US as inflows of Venezuelan oil will mean gas, diesel, and jet fuel prices will drop. He said that could push down prices to the benefit of consumers, especially lower-income ones, cut supply chain costs, and ease some uncertainty about the future for business owners.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — South Korean President Lee Jae Myung arrived in China on Sunday as Beijing looks to deepen ties with the nearby country after heightened tensions between China and Japan over Taiwan, a self-ruled island it claims as its sovereign territory.\n\nLee's four-day trip is his first visit to China since taking office in June. It comes at a time of heightened tensions between China and Japan, after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in November that her country’s military could get involved if China were to take action against Taiwan.\n\nChina's official news agency Xinhua reported on Sunday afternoon that Lee arrived in Beijing. During his stay, Lee will meet with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, their second meeting in just two months.\n\nLee signals commitment to China's ties\n\nAhead of his trip, Lee gave an interview to China's state broadcaster CCTV at Seoul's Cheong Wa Dae, the presidential office also known as the Blue House. Lee was quoted as saying that it was his first interview held in the presidential palace and that he hoped people would understand that his government cares about the relations between Beijing and Seoul.\n\nIn the interview, he assured that South Korea consistently respects the “One-China” policy when it comes to Taiwan, CCTV reported Friday. He said the healthy development of Beijing-Seoul relations depends on mutual respect. Lee also praised Xi as a “truly reliable neighbor.\"\n\nLast week, China staged large-scale military drills around the island for two days to warn against separatist and “external interference” forces. At that time, the Chinese Foreign Ministry accused Taiwan’s ruling party of trying to seek independence through requesting U.S. support.\n\nThe U.S. planned large-scale arms sales to Taiwan angered Beijing in December, leading to China sanctioning 20 U.S. defense-related companies.\n\nLee said Seoul's cooperation with the U.S, its military ally, does not mean South Korea-China relations should move toward confrontation, CCTV reported. He acknowledged that past misunderstandings between his country and China had hindered bilateral relations.\n\n“This visit to China aims to minimize or eliminate these past misunderstandings or contradictions, to elevate and develop South Korea-China relations to a new stage,” CCTV quoted him as saying.\n\nTo discuss the Korean Peninsula and strengthen economic ties\n\nSouth Korea and the U.S. have urged China, North Korea’s traditional ally and economic pipeline, to use its influence on its socialist neighbor to convince it to return to talks or abandon its nuclear program.\n\nBut China has long been suspected of avoiding fully implementing U.N. sanctions on North Korea and sending clandestine aid shipments to help the North stay afloat and continue to serve as a bulwark against U.S. influence on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nOn Sunday, North Korea launched multiple ballistic missiles toward the sea, South Korea’s military said, the latest weapons demonstration by the North ahead of its upcoming ruling party congress.\n\nLee’s visit is meant to strengthen bilateral ties and discuss ways to restore peace on the Korean Peninsula, South Korean officials said.\n\nDuring Monday’s summit, Lee and Xi are to hold “in-depth talks on substantive ways” to address security and economic issues facing the two countries, South Korea’s national security adviser Wi Sung-lac told a briefing Friday. On Tuesday, Lee is to meet Zhao Leji, chairman of the National People’s Congress, and Premier Li Qiang, Wi said.\n\nDuring Lee’s trip, South Korea will also request that China play “a constructive role” in efforts to promote peace on the Korean Peninsula, Wi said. In their November talks, Lee already asked Xi to make greater efforts to persuade North Korea to return to talks.\n\nSouth Korea would push for substantial achievements that could directly benefit ordinary citizens in both countries too, Wi said.\n\nKim reported from Seoul, South Korea",

    "title": "China Stopped Production On The World's Largest Particle Accelerator - Here's Why",
    "description": "China's ambitious new particle accelerator was meant to pick up where the Large Hadron Collider left off, but the project was put on pause. Here's the story.",
    "fullText": "Planned to be the largest particle accelerator in the world, China's Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) was meant to be about 100 kilometers or 62 miles long. That's much bigger than CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with an approximately 27 kilometer circumference – or nearly 17 miles. These systems, especially the LHC, play a huge role in studying how the universe began during the Big Bang.\n\nDevelopment for CEPC started in 2012, around the time CERN discovered the Higgs boson particle; however, it appears the multibillion-dollar project is now paused. It was not included in the country's next five-year plan, spanning 2026 to 2030, which means it's considered a lower priority by the state — it will see less funding and resources. Wang Yifang from the Institute of High Energy Physics confirmed the change, but although the recent proposal to be included in China's five-year plan was denied, the team plans to resubmit the CEPC proposal in 2030.\n\nWhile it hasn't been directly confirmed, the CEPC would cost an estimated $5.1 billion, money that the country might want to divert elsewhere. In that case, Wang says if the European Future Circular Collider (FCC) – the next-generation collider that would effectively be LHC's successor with a much larger 90.7-kilometer (or 56-mile) circumference – is approved before the 2030 proposals, they'll likely join forces with the related teams instead.\n\nTo summarize, China's CEPC is out, likely due to cost and resource requirements, but the European's FCC still has potential, and the Chinese physicist team may join up if the proposal is approved before the next round of China's plans.\n\nDiscoveries from the systems we have operating now, like the Higgs boson discovery at LHC, occur because of how particle accelerators actually work. They fire particles into a big tunnel, or underground rings, which circle around at incredibly fast speeds before colliding. By observing these collisions, scientists get a glimpse into what the early universe looked like, as well as other foundational elements like quarks, the building blocks of visible matter in the universe. Scientists also used the system to create quark soup, a substance that hadn't been seen for billions of years before that. Generally speaking, when two particles collide, for the infinitesimally small span of time afterwards, scientists can see traces or patterns that are otherwise invisible — that's exactly how they discovered the Higgs boson.\n\nThe larger colliders, like CEPC or FCC, would not only introduce larger tunnel systems but more advanced and unique equipment, to uncover heavier or different particles, many of which the LHC simply cannot create. Imagine what kind of alchemy could be achieved with the larger, more capable collider systems.\n\nAs the current system, the LHC is expected to be phased out by the 2040s; meanwhile, the FCC, if approved, will begin development in the 2030s. That said, construction can't start quite that easily: Before anything happens, the CERN Member States and international partners have to give the upgrade project a greenlight.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "title": "China’s stealth fighter jet approached key Taiwanese airbase without detection: Report",
    "description": "A new PLA video appears to show a Chengdu J-20 stealth fighter near Taiwan raises questions less about detection failure than strategic intent.",
    "fullText": "New footage has been released that seems to show a Chinese Chengdu J-20 stealth fighter flying close to a Taiwanese airbase during a recent military exercise. Purportedly taken during the recent “Justice Mission 2025,\" this has sparked debate as to whether the aircraft was able to approach undetected or not.\n\n“China’s J-20 stealth fighter flew within visual range of Taiwan’s coastline. The Taiwanese failed to detect the J-20. It would’ve been a propaganda coup if Taiwan got a photo of the J-20 with their F-16 sniper targeting pod. This happened around Checheng township in Pingtung, at the very southern tip of Taiwan,” wrote a defence analyst on X.\n\nWhile hard to confirm, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has claimed that one of its J-20s managed to fly close to Taiwan's Pingtung airbase. According to reports, this incident occurred on Tuesday (Dec 30) during the second day of the exercise.\n\nIt is important to note that these claims have yet to be confirmed by third parties, notably whether the J-20 was actually able to penetrate Taiwanese airspace in the first place.\n\nIf true, then such an occurrence would be very worrying for Taiwanese defense forcesm notably how this could happen in the first place. It could, of course, just be a bluff from the PLA to make Taiwan question its defensive readiness against Chinese forces.\n\nWhile no missiles were fired or lives lost, the supposed incursion by China's fifth-generation J-20 will not be without consequences. Likely, Taiwan will now have to assume worst-case scenarios and spend some time investigating what happened.\n\nThey will want to know if the J-20 was able to find radar blind spots in its air defense and take corrective actions accordingly. That will come at a cost for Taiwan.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLsV8flG1Q4&pp=ygUTSi0yMCBUYWl3YW4gYWlyYmFzZQ%3D%3D\n\nThe focus on Pingtung is also interesting as it is one of the nation's key airbases. It has some critical training and sortie-running infrastructure for the Taiwanese air force and is a cornerstone of its air defense.\n\nIf China can operate stealth aircraft near that area (even occasionally), it compresses Taiwan’s reaction time in a real crisis. That is strategically more important than whether this specific flight happened exactly as claimed.\n\nSo far, Taiwan has remained silent on the matter, with key officials neither confirming nor denying China's claims. This is likely deliberate to prevent China from taking a public relations victory.\n\nIf they deny the claim, this will look to some like Taiwan is covering up for a failure of its air defenses. Confirming the event would also validate PLA propaganda.\n\nWhether the J-20 incursion occurred or not, it has wider implications for the region, too. Firstly, it helps to normalize PLA proximity to Taiwan and blurs peacetime versus wartime behaviour.\n\nIt also serves as a training for PLA forces under realistic conditions, and can be used by them to sow doubt and confusion. So while the claim could be fictitious at worst or exaggerated at best, it will have very real impacts on Taiwan one way or the other.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump invited Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi during a phone call Friday to visit the United States this year, the Japanese foreign ministry said, in what would be the ultraconservative leader's first trip to the U.S. since taking office in October.\n\nThe White House is yet to confirm the call and the invitation. It comes as ties between Japan and China have been strained, ramping up tensions in the region. The U.S., a close ally of Japan, is seeking to strengthen its ties with Tokyo but also stabilize its relationship with Beijing ahead of a likely trip by Trump to China in April.\n\nBeijing staged two-day military exercises in the waters off Taiwan this week. Takaichi, Japan's first female prime minister, infuriated China late last year when she said Chinese military action against Taiwan could be grounds for a Japanese military response, breaking away from former Japanese leaders’ strategic ambiguity on the highly sensitive matter.\n\nIn a statement Friday, the Japanese foreign ministry said Takaichi and Trump agreed to coordinate for the visit to happen this spring. Kyodo News, Japan's news agency, suggested that Takaichi's trip could coincide with the annual cherry blossom festival in Washington.\n\nThe foreign ministry said the two leaders affirmed that they would “carve out a new chapter in the history of the Japan-U.S. alliance” in a year when the U.S. celebrates the 250th anniversary of its founding and that they would “further deepen the friendly relations” between the two nations, including economic and security cooperation.\n\nTakaichi and Trump also agreed on their commitment to promoting cooperation among like-minded partners, including the Japan-U.S.-South Korea partnership, and to a free and open Indo-Pacific, the foreign ministry statement said.\n\nThe two exchanged views “mainly on the Indo-Pacific region,\" the ministry said, but it did not provide details, including whether the two discussed recent actions by Beijing in the region.\n\nChina's military drills off Taiwan also came after the Trump administration announced a package of arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $11 billion. If approved by Congress, it would represent the largest such aid to the island ever — a move criticized sharply by China.\n\nBeijing claims sovereignty over the self-governed island and vows to seize it — by force if necessary. The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to provide Taiwan with sufficient hardware to deter any attack from the mainland.\n\nTrump on Monday said he was not informed of the exercises in advance but still touted his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nTrump met Takaichi in Tokyo in October, shortly after she took office. The two exchanged warm words, and Trump took her with him when he spoke to U.S. troops aboard an aircraft carrier in Japan.\n\nAfter Takaichi's Taiwan comments angered Beijing, Trump called her and said they were “extremely good friends” and that she should call him any time, according to the Japanese leader, without disclosing if the two talked about her remarks.",

    "fullText": "Chinese leader Xi Jinping is pleased with his country's showing in the race for AI dominance.\n\nIn his annual New Year's address on Wednesday, the Chinese leader lauded his country's tech and AI advancements in 2025, saying that China \"integrated science and technology deeply with industries, and made a stream of new innovations.\"\n\n\"Many large AI models have been competing in a race to the top, and breakthroughs have been achieved in the research and development of our own chips,\" Xi said in the speech made in Beijing.\n\nHe added, \"All this has turned China into one of the economies with the fastest-growing innovation capabilities.\"\n\nApart from developments in AI, Xi also highlighted China's Tianwen-2 asteroid sampling mission and its latest electromagnetic catapult system-equipped aircraft carrier.\n\nHe talked about China breaking ground on the construction of the world's largest dam in Tibetan territory, and its progress in developing humanoid robots and drones.\n\nXi's end-of-year 2025 comments follow a strong year for the country, which saw it compete neck and neck with the US on AI advancements.\n\nThe year started with China's Deepseek AI startup releasing its R1 AI model in January, which rivalled OpenAI's o1 and sent US tech stocks plunging. Nvidia, a major player in AI hardware, saw its stock drop by more than 17% on January 27, erasing billions from its value.\n\nThe US's ban on exporting advanced AI chips has given a boost to China's homegrown chip producers, propelling their founders, such as MetaX Integrated Circuits Shanghai's cofounder Chen Weiliang, into the billionaire ranks.\n\nHowever, President Donald Trump granted Nvidia a win in December, permitting it to sell its H200 chips to \"approved customers\" in China.\n\nAnd Meta announced on Wednesday that it would acquire China-founded AI startup Manus in a deal reported to be worth more than $2 billion, making it one of the US tech's biggest acquisitions of an Asian AI company.\n\nInvestors are taking note: Jason Draho, a UBS wealth management executive, told Business Insider in November that investors should consider AI stocks in China as a way to counterbalance US tech stocks.",

    "description": "DeepSeek has released a new AI training method that analysts say is a \"breakthrough\" for scaling large language models.",
    "fullText": "DeepSeek got the year rolling with a new idea for training AI. And analysts say it could have a massive impact on the industry.\n\nThe Chinese AI startup published a research paper on Wednesday, describing a method to train large language models that could shape \"the evolution of foundational models,\" it said.\n\nThe paper, co-authored by its founder Liang Wenfeng, introduces what DeepSeek calls \"Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections,\" or mHC, a training approach designed to scale models without them becoming unstable or breaking altogether.\n\nAs language models grow, researchers often try to improve performance by allowing different parts of a model to share more information internally. However, this increases the risk of the information becoming unstable, the paper said.\n\nDeepSeek's latest research enables models to share richer internal communication in a constrained manner, preserving training stability and computational efficiency even as models scale, it added.\n\nWei Sun, the principal analyst for AI at Counterpoint Research, told Business Insider on Friday that the approach is a \"striking breakthrough.\"\n\nDeepSeek combined various techniques to minimize the extra cost of training a model, Sun said. She added that even with a slight increase in cost, the new training method could yield much higher performance.\n\nSun said the paper reads as a statement of DeepSeek's internal capabilities. By redesigning the training stack end-to-end, the company is signaling that it can pair \"rapid experimentation with highly unconventional research ideas.\"\n\nDeepseek can \"once again, bypass compute bottlenecks and unlock leaps in intelligence,\" she said, referring to its \"Sputnik moment\" in January 2025, when the company unveiled its R1 reasoning model.\n\nThe launch shook the tech industry and the US stock market, showing that the R1 model could match top competitors, such as ChatGPT's o1, at a fraction of the cost.\n\nLian Jye Su, the chief analyst at Omdia, a technology research and consulting firm, told Business Insider on Friday that the published research could have a ripple effect across the industry, with rival AI labs developing their own versions of the approach.\n\n\"The willingness to share important findings with the industry while continuing to deliver unique value through new models showcases a newfound confidence in the Chinese AI industry,\" Su said of DeepSeek's paper. Openness is embraced as \"a strategic advantage and key differentiator,\" he added.\n\nThe paper comes as DeepSeek is reportedly working toward the release of its next flagship model R2, following an earlier postponement.\n\nR2, which had been expected in mid-2025, was delayed after Liang expressed dissatisfaction with the model's performance, according to a June report by The Information. The report said the launch was also complicated by shortages of advanced AI chips, a constraint that has increasingly shaped how Chinese labs train and deploy frontier models.\n\nWhile the paper does not mention R2, its timing has raised eyebrows. DeepSeek previously published foundational training research ahead of its R1 model launch.\n\nSu said DeepSeek's track record suggests the new architecture will \"definitely be implemented in their new model.\"\n\nSun, on the other hand, is more cautious. \"There is most likely no standalone R2 coming,\" Sun said. Since DeepSeek has already integrated earlier R1 updates in its V3 model, the technique could form the backbone of DeepSeek's V4 model, she added.\n\nBusiness Insider's Alistair Barr wrote in June that DeepSeek's updates to its R1 model failed to generate much traction in the tech industry. Barr argued that distribution matters, and DeepSeek still lacks the broad reach enjoyed by leading AI labs — such as OpenAI and Google — particularly in Western markets.",

    "fullText": "TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te on Thursday vowed to defend the self-ruled island’s sovereignty in the face of China’s “expansionist ambitions,” days after Beijing wrapped up live-fire military drills near its shores.\n\n“In the face of China’s rising expansionist ambitions, the international community is watching to see whether the Taiwanese people have the resolve to defend themselves,” Lai said in his New Year’s address.\n\n“As president, my stance has always been clear: to firmly safeguard national sovereignty, strengthen national defense and the resilience of the whole society, and comprehensively construct an effective deterrence and democratic defense mechanism,” he added.\n\nLai’s comments came days after China wrapped up live-fire drills around Taiwan featuring rocket launches, aircraft and warships. Beijing had expressed anger at a planned U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, as well as at Japan’s new leader’s comments that Tokyo could intervene in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan.\n\nChina sees Taiwan as its own territory and threatens to annex it by force if necessary. A former Japanese colony, Taiwan has been governed independently from the mainland since 1949, when the Nationalist Party lost a civil war against the Chinese Communist Party and retreated to the island.\n\nLai's speech was met angrily in Beijing, where a spokesperson for the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office called the president “a saboteur of peace, a troublemaker and a warmonger,” according to the official Xinhua news agency.\n\n“No matter what Lai and the Democratic Progressive Party authorities say or do, they cannot change the fact that Taiwan is part of China,\" said spokesperson Chen Binhua.\n\nThe planned arms sale, valued at more than $11 billion, is the U.S.’s largest so far to Taiwan. It includes missiles, drones, artillery systems and military software.\n\nThe United States is obligated by its own laws to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.\n\nChina’s leader Xi Jinping called Taiwan’s eventual annexation “ unstoppable \" during his own televised New Year’s address on Wednesday.\n\nTaiwan last year announced a special $40 billion budget for arms purchases, including to build an air defense system with high-level detection and interception capabilities called the Taiwan Dome.\n\nThe budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033, and comes after Lai already pledged to raise defense spending to 5% of the island’s GDP, as part of his strategy amid China’s threats of invasion.\n\n“Facing China’s serious military ambitions, Taiwan has no time to wait,” Lai said.\n\nMistreanu reported from Beijing.",

    "fullText": "Chinese tech stocks kicked off 2026 by testing how far their AI-fueled rally can run.\n\nShares of Shanghai Biren Technology, an AI chip designer, surged nearly 120% on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange by midday on Friday after the company raised 5.58 billion Hong Kong dollars, or $717 million, in an initial public offering.\n\nThe stock opened at 35.70 Hong Kong dollars, well above its IPO price of 19.60 Hong Kong dollars.\n\nThat appetite was reflected across the offering, with the retail portion subscribed more than 2,300 times, according to exchange filings, underscoring intense interest in China's homegrown AI hardware sector.\n\nThe enthusiasm has been building more broadly. Chinese AI and semiconductor stocks have rallied since the breakout of the China-made DeepSeek-R1 AI model in January last year, which helped push the Hang Seng Tech Index 23% higher in 2025. The index jumped by as much as 3.9% on Friday.\n\nWashington's tightening export controls on advanced Nvidia chips have also fueled the boom by accelerating demand for domestic alternatives.\n\n\"Nvidia's once-dominant position in China's AI chip market has effectively evaporated in 2025, marking a seismic shift in the global intelligent-computing landscape,\" wrote Andrei Zakharov, an analyst who publishes on Smartkarma, in a note last week.\n\nShanghai Biren's stunning stock market debut underscored China's AI rally, which reversed a few bruising years for the country's tech sector amid a regulatory crackdown and broad economic challenges.\n\nFollowing the DeepSeek-R1 breakout, startups such as Cambricon, Moore Threads, and Metax have drawn billions of dollars in funding as they race to supply chips for data centers, large language models, and industrial AI applications.\n\nThat surge in capital is also translating into personal fortunes, with China's AI chip boom minting billionaires at breakneck speed even as the broader economy continues to sputter amid a long-drawn property crisis.\n\nShanghai Biren's blockbuster debut is expected to be followed by more fresh supply, with Hong Kong emerging as the key venue for that fundraising drive.\n\nBaidu, a Chinese big tech firm, said on Friday that its artificial-intelligence chip unit has confidentially filed for a Hong Kong listing.\n\nAt least 25 companies made their market debuts in Hong Kong last month, marking the busiest month for IPOs since November 2019, according to Bloomberg data. About half of those listings were technology firms.\n\nMore AI-related Chinese tech listings are expected this month. They include startup MiniMax Group and Knowledge Atlas Technology, also known as Zhipu AI, which are expected to make their debut next week.",

    "description": "The DF-27, a conventional strike missile believed to be able to target ships, has an estimated range that reaches parts of the continental US.",
    "fullText": "China appears to have fielded a new intercontinental ballistic missile, the DF-27, which can range the continental US and, unlike other ICBMs, serve a mix of missions, including targeting ships, a new Pentagon report says.\n\nThe Department of Defense's annual report on the Chinese military, the latest of which came out last week, is the first public assessment that the missile is operational. The missile is said to have a land-attack and anti-ship role.\n\nThe latter role is unusual for an intercontinental-range ballistic missile, as is its conventional strike role documented in the new Pentagon report. ICBMs are primarily for nuclear strike.\n\nThe latest report offers little on the new missile beyond a map showing China's \"fielded conventional strike.\" The DF-27, identified as an ICBM with a range of 5,000 to 8,000 km, shorter than some other systems built for strategic nuclear strike, is a new addition to that map showing Chinese missile ranges.\n\nThat range completely covers Hawaii and Alaska, and it also extends into parts of the continental US. The exact reach might vary depending on the launch site, but broadly, the weapon puts naval forces and US military installations across the Pacific at risk in a new way.\n\nA \"long-range\" DF-27 missile was first mentioned in the 2021 Pentagon report. It said that indications on the range hinted at either an intercontinental- or intermediate-range missile. That uncertainty persisted until the 2025 report identified it as an ICBM.\n\nThe 2024 Pentagon report notably offered the most detail, stating that the DF-27 had been \"deployed\" to the Rocket Force. It added that this weapon likely has an option for an HGV, a hypersonic glide vehicle, \"as well as conventional land-attack, conventional antiship, and nuclear capabilities.\" The 2025 report, however, did not put the weapon under \"fielded nuclear capabilities.\"\n\nAccording to the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, the DF-27 carries potentially significant strategic implications.\n\nIn an early assessment of the Chinese missile published two years ago, the group cited a leaked intelligence briefing indicating the missile was tested in February 2023 and warned that it could give China another means to hold targets at risk beyond the second island chain, with a high likelihood of being able to penetrate US ballistic-missile defenses and the potential to serve as a \"carrier killer.\"\n\nChina has not publicly commented on the DF-27, though local media have at times approached the topic indirectly.\n\nFielding the new DF-27 makes China the first to have an operational, conventionally armed ICBM. The US and Russia have not fielded similar capabilities; however, both have been pursuing new intermediate-range capabilities since the collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which the US walked away from in 2019 after accusing Russia of non-compliance.\n\nThe DF-27 is the latest example of China's efforts to develop and field varied, flexible strike options for a potential conflict. The missile branch of its military, called the People's Liberation Army's Rocket Force, has grown exponentially, and Chinese military doctrine emphasizes the need for it to possess the ability to quickly, precisely, and, in some cases, preemptively strike targets.\n\nWith the new DF-27 ICBM, \"China became the first to field an analogous capability: a conventional ICBM—with an ASBM variant—that can conduct rapid, long-range precision strikes out to intercontinental distances, including against its 'strong enemy's' homeland and its naval forces at sea,\" Andrew Erickson, a professor at the US Naval War College's China Maritime Studies Inistitute, wrote last week.\n\nSince the Pentagon's annual reports cover only developments from the previous year, the newest one doesn't include other notable missile developments in China from this year. An important development in September was Beijing's reveal of the DF-61 and DF-31BJ, both ICBMs, at a military parade.\n\nIt's unclear whether those missiles are operational, but even if they're still in development, the implications of the presentation in the Chinese capital are that these missiles will eventually be additions to China's already sizable land-based ICBM arsenal.",

    "fullText": "TOKYO (AP) — Japan is barreling forward with efforts to significantly boost its military capabilities to stand up to China’s growing threats by doubling annual arms spending. The goal comes as Tokyo’s main ally, the United States, pushes for more military assistance in Asia and a military hawk and ultra-conservative takes over Japan's leadership.\n\nJapan says it is still a peaceful nation and the buildup is necessary for a more self-reliant military that can better deter China. But Beijing and other critics see Japan as deviating from its postwar peace pledge, pointing to Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's statement soon after taking office that any Chinese military action against Taiwan could be grounds for a Japanese military response.\n\nJapan’s transformation into one of the world’s major defense spenders has developed over decades and raises the question of whether the ongoing buildup is a violation of its pacifist constitution.\n\nJapan’s constitution has been hollowed out\n\nAfter World War II, Japan was not supposed to have a military.\n\nDuring the 1945-1952 U.S. occupation, American officials wanted to stamp out the militarism that led to Japanese aggression across Asia before and during the war.\n\nUnder Article 9 of the U.S.-drafted 1947 constitution, Japan renounced the use of force to settle international disputes, and the right to maintain land, sea and air forces for that purpose.\n\nThe U.S. changed its mind about Japanese militarism when the Korean War started in 1950. Japan became an ally, not a threat, leading to the creation of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces in 1954. Article 9 is now widely seen as the legal basis for Japan to have a sufficient military to defend itself.\n\nJapan has since repeatedly stretched the definition of self-defense, allowing overseas dispatches of its troops as part of international peacekeeping operations, though mostly avoiding combat missions.\n\nA big change came in 2014, under former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who wanted Japan to have a normal military. Abe newly interpreted Article 9 as legalizing collective defense. The following year, a security law allowed Japan to use force if the United States or other friendly nations come under enemy attack, even if Japan is not being attacked.\n\nThis was Abe’s attempt to have a normal military without formally changing the constitution.\n\nTakaichi angered China by giving a hypothetical example of such a situation, a deviation from former leaders’ strategic ambiguity.\n\nThe flap with Beijing escalated in December when Chinese aircraft locked their radars, considered possible preparation for firing missiles, on Japanese planes during Chinese aircraft carrier drills near southwestern Japan.\n\nTwo Chinese aircraft carriers also were spotted in June operating near the southern Japanese island of Iwo Jima for the first time. This led to worry in Tokyo about Beijing’s rapidly expanding military activity far beyond its borders and in areas around islands claimed by both countries.\n\nTakaichi’s Cabinet last week approved a record defense budget plan. It exceeds 9 trillion yen ($58 billion) for the coming year and aims to fortify its strike-back capability and coastal defense with cruise missiles and unmanned arsenals.\n\nIn Beijing later that day, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian criticized the Takaichi government for accelerating the pace of its military buildup and expansion, and added: “Japan is deviating from the path of peaceful development it has long claimed to uphold and is moving further and further in a dangerous direction.”\n\nChina, which spends a huge amount on its own defense, may also see Takaichi as a defender of Japanese wartime aggression. Before taking office, she was a regular at Tokyo’s Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japan’s 2.5 million war dead, including convicted war criminals. Victims of Japanese aggression, especially China and the Koreas, see visits to the shrine as tantamount to a lack of remorse about Japan’s wartime past.\n\nTakaichi stayed away from Yasukuni in 2025 and sent a religious ornament marking the Aug. 15 anniversary of Japan’s defeat as a personal gesture instead of praying at the shrine.\n\nJapan takes on more offensive roles\n\nA fundamental change came in December 2022 when former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s government adopted a security strategy stating the need for Japan to acquire strike-back capability with long-range missiles, a major break from Japan’s self-defense-only policy.\n\nThe strategy names China as Japan’s biggest strategic challenge and calls for a more offensive role for Japanese troops under its security alliance with the U.S as the allies work more closely together.\n\nMasahiro Sakata, former head of the Cabinet Legislative Bureau, described the move as “the death of Article 9.”\n\nAfter the war, Japan long prioritized economic development over defense while relying largely on the U.S. by hosting about 50,000 American troops who also serve the region.\n\nJapan maintained a defense spending cap of 1% of GDP until the annual defense budget started to rise under Abe’s nearly decade-long leadership, to about 1.1%. Takaichi is certain to achieve a 2% target by March, two years earlier than planned, and is expected to push for more spending in coming years as Japan is under growing pressure after NATO adopted a new target of 5%.\n\nJapan plans to promote defense industry\n\nTakaichi’s revised security and defense policy would aim to further bolster Japan with unmanned combative weapons and long-range missiles. It is expected to scrap remaining restrictions on arms exports to promote the development of Japan’s defense industry and cooperation with friendly nations.\n\nJapan has long banned arms exports but has significantly eased restrictions in recent years and is now developing next-generation fighter jets with the UK and Italy while finalizing a deal to sell frigates to Australia. Japan also will to provide support for construction and maintenance for U.S. warships.\n\nA government-commissioned panel has proposed Japan consider developing a nuclear submarine to achieve a more long-distance deterrence capability, a controversial idea for a country that has long maintained non-nuclear principles.\n\nJapan has requested Washington ensure protection through the extended deterrence of nuclear weapons. A number of officials recently expressed support for Japan’s nuclear possession, which has led to criticism from Japanese atomic bomb survivors and other pacifist groups.\n\nJapan stands by its three non-nuclear principles of not possessing, not producing and not allowing its presence, according to Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, although he said Japan is considering all options for a possible new submarine.",

    "description": "China's massive unmanned aircraft carries a payload of other smaller drones and has just had its first successful flight. Here's what we know about it.",
    "fullText": "The world's first drone mothership, Jui Tian, took to the skies for its first-ever flight on December 11th, 2025, in the Pucheng region of Shaanxi province in China. The massive remotely piloted jet carries up to 100 drones, which it can launch while airborne to reach faraway targets. Able to take off with a payload over 13,200 pounds and with a wingspan of 82 feet, Chinese military aviation analyst Fu Qianshao noted that it can carry more weapons and equipment than modern fighter jets and bombers. It has designated hardpoints for guided missiles and bombs on top of the 100 drones.\n\nOriginally revealed at the Zhuhai Airshow in late 2024, the first flight over a year later carries a lot of possibilities for China's navy. With a focus on long-range ballistic missiles and a fighter fleet with the capabilities to operate deep in the ocean, China is looking for ways to improve the range of its aerial army. The incoming army of drones from multiple directions would prove difficult for the opposition to deal with. For now, however, the Jui Tian may take on a more supportive role within China, like transporting heavy cargo to remote locations and providing emergency support during natural disasters.\n\nChina has recently been expanding the use of unmanned aviation in various branches of the military. The Jui Tian is remotely piloted over a satellite data link, able to deliver drones or other payloads over short distances with a 12-hour endurance. However, China has a lot of long-range unmanned aircraft in testing stages that would further shake up aerial combat and defenses.\n\nConcepts of the GJ-11 Sharp Sword, an unmanned stealth bomber, have been seen since 2018. The goal is for the aircraft to be fully autonomous over time. China has also been testing the CH-7 unmanned high-altitude stealth reconnaissance aircraft for a 2030s arrival, with the goal of supporting operations for both the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy and the Air Force. Images were revealed earlier in the year of an unmanned range stealth aircraft that appears to be designed for penetration missions by expertly shattering radar signals. And it's not just the air — China recently revealed an unmanned underwater drone system meant to evade sonar detection.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "description": "China's missile arsenal can strike targets around Taiwan, across the Indo-Pacific, and even in the continental US. The maps paint a clear picture.",
    "fullText": "China's missile arsenal is expanding rapidly, and new maps and data from the Pentagon show its size and reach.\n\nChina's missile branch, known as the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force, has seen substantial growth in recent years as Beijing builds new platforms for conventional and nuclear strike. Its capabilities threaten US, allied, and partner forces.\n\nThe latest Pentagon report on China's military offers estimates for the number of launchers and missiles in the Chinese arsenal, including the country's intercontinental ballistic missiles, key parts of its nuclear deterrent.\n\nChinese ICBMs include missiles like the DF-5 and DF-41. The Pentagon estimates China has 550 ICBM launchers and 400 missiles with estimated ranges beyond 5,500 km, the threshold for classification as an ICBM.\n\nFor China's medium-range ballistic missiles, such as China's DF-21s or hypersonic DF-17, the Pentagon assesses that China has 300 launchers for 1,300 missiles with ranges between 1,000 and 3,000 km. The report also documented increases in the number of launchers and missiles for some notable systems. China's intermediate-range ballistic missiles, like the DF-26 missile, jumped from 250 launchers in last year's report to 300 this year, and the number of IRBMs total went from 500 to 550.\n\nThese figures illustrate how heavily Beijing has invested in a powerful, diverse missile arsenal. The Pentagon highlighted in its report that the Rocket Force could play an important role in a Chinese invasion of Taiwan or other regional conflict.\n\nAccording to the latest report, China's rocket force \"is prepared to conduct missile attacks against high-value targets, including Taiwan's C2 [command and control] facilities, air bases, and radar sites\" as well as deter or delay the US or its allies and partners from coming to Taiwan's aid.\n\nThe Pentagon said that the Rocket Force has continued to rehearse strikes in recent military exercises, including 2024 drills simulating an invasion or blockade of Taiwan.\n\nOne map in the report shows the estimated reach of Chinese missiles that could be particularly relevant in a fight over Taiwan, weapons such as ship- and shore-launched surface-to-air missiles for knocking out hostile aircraft, as well as anti-ship cruise missiles fired from naval platforms like Chinese destroyers and land-based close- and short-range ballistic missiles.\n\nAnother Pentagon map shows the estimated reach of China's conventional strike missiles, including the DF-17 and DF-21 MRBMs, the DF-26 IRBM, and the newly fielded DF-27 ICBM, which, like the DF-26 and some DF-21s, has an anti-ship role in addition to land attack.\n\nMany of these systems can reach across the first island chain, which includes Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines, while longer-range missiles extend toward the second island chain and beyond.\n\nThe DF-26 is concerning for US planners. The weapon, nicknamed the \"Guam Express,\" can be armed with either conventional or nuclear warheads and reach US installations on Guam. It can target US aircraft carriers and other surface ships as well.\n\nBombers, like China's H-6, carrying CJ-20 cruise missiles could threaten parts of Alaska. And then the ICBMs can range significantly further. The DF-27 can, for instance, range parts of the continental United States.\n\nThe Department of Defense report also looks at China's nuclear strike options, such as land-based ICBMs and submarine-launched ballistic missiles.\n\nChina test-launched an ICBM, specifically a DF-31B missile, in September 2024, firing it from a position on Hainan Island into the Pacific. The test was the first beyond the country's borders since the 1980s and allowed China to verify ICBM performance. The Department of Defense suspects weapons tests like these may become more regular.\n\nThis year, at a military parade in Beijing, China unveiled new, previously unseen ICBMs, shocking China watchers. Those weapons, including the new DF-61 and DF-31BJ, are not included in the Pentagon's assessments.\n\nChina also continues to bolster its nuclear warhead count, estimated at over 600 warheads. Although 2024 saw a slower rate of production than previous years, the Pentagon still assesses that the Chinese military is on its way to 1,000 warheads by 2030, only a fraction of the US and Russian stockpiles.\n\nA Pentagon map estimating the ranges of Chinese missiles available for nuclear strike indicates that three — the DF-5, DF-41, and DF-31 — all have the continental US well within range, while the submarine-launched JL-3 missile can hit most of it from waters near China. On a submarine positioned farther out, more targets could be within striking distance.\n\nDespite these continued advancements, questions remain on the differences in quality and capabilities of Chinese weapons and training compared to the US. The Pentagon also believes China is still navigating the impacts of a vast anti-corruption campaign in the military that has particularly targeted PLARF officials.\n\nThe campaign could be detrimental if driven by political agendas, or it could deliver long-term improvements if it addresses actual problems within the force. At this point, it's unclear how the changes will affect it.",

    "description": "Solar farms are already proving to be an effective addition to traditional power, but now it looks like they may have additional environmental benefits.",
    "fullText": "The world's largest cluster of solar farms can be found in Qinghai, China, high on the remote Tibetan Plateau. It's far bigger than the USA's largest solar farm, and it's one of several megaprojects that the Chinese government hopes will push the country towards a future where most of its electricity is produced from renewable resources. The Qinghai cluster can produce almost 17,000 megawatts of power, according to the New York Times, but it isn't just a huge producer of energy.\n\nA study published in the Nature journal also claims that the presence of miles of solar panels changes the desert environment around the farm, and actually helps improve the biodiversity of the surrounding area. The study analysed a wide range of environmental factors, including the nutrients in the soil around the solar farms, the range of plant and microbial species that lived there, and the humidity of the surrounding air.\n\nResearchers found that the presence of the solar farm helped boost moisture levels in the soil, which in turn affected its structure. They suggested that the increased moisture could be due to the panels absorbing most of the Sun's radiation, which led to the soil underneath losing less water through evaporation. The regular washing of the panels was also noted as a potential reason for the increased soil moisture content.\n\nThe improved condition of the soil helped a wider variety of microbes and plants live within the grounds of the solar farm than in the surrounding desert. It's fresh evidence that, as well as helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by providing clean electricity, solar panels can also help the environment in more unexpected ways. The study also noted that the solar farm required local workers to operate, which helped boost jobs in an area where there were otherwise relatively few opportunities for employment.\n\nChina has an advantage when it comes to creating giant solar farms, since most of the world's solar cell supply comes from Chinese manufacturers. It also has a huge domestic demand for electricity, particularly since it's the world's largest EV market by a significant margin. According to IEA, 17 million EVs were sold worldwide in 2024, and more than 11 million of those were sold in China. Around 10% of all cars on the road in China are electric, and to power them, the country will need to keep developing projects like the Qinghai solar farm cluster. If it keeps building them within its vast deserts, these farms will potentially have the bonus side effect of improving the quality of the environment around them, too.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Dec 30 (Reuters) - China is requiring chipmakers to use at least 50% domestically made equipment for adding new capacity, three people familiar with the matter said, as Beijing pushes to build a self-sufficient semiconductor supply chain.\n\nThe rule is not publicly documented, but chipmakers seeking state approval to build or expand their plants have been told ​by authorities in recent months that they must prove through procurement tenders that at least half their equipment will be Chinese-made, the people told Reuters.\n\nThe mandate is one of the most ‌significant measures Beijing has introduced to wean itself off reliance on foreign technology, a push that gathered pace after the U.S. tightened technology export restrictions in 2023, banning sales of advanced AI chips and semiconductor equipment to China.\n\nWhile those U.S. export restrictions blocked ‌the sale of some of the most advanced tools, the 50% rule is leading Chinese manufacturers to choose domestic suppliers even in areas where foreign equipment from the U.S., Japan, South Korea and Europe remain available.\n\nApplications failing the threshold are typically rejected, though authorities grant flexibility depending on supply constraints, the people said. The requirements are relaxed for advanced chip production lines, where domestically developed equipment is not yet fully available.\n\n\"Authorities prefer if it is much higher than 50%,\" one source told Reuters. \"Eventually they are aiming for the plants to use 100% domestic equipment.\"\n\nChina's industry ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The sources did not wish ⁠to be identified as the measure is not public.\n\nChina's President ‌Xi Jinping has been calling for a \"whole nation\" effort to build a fully self-sufficient domestic semiconductor supply chain that involves thousands of engineers and scientists at companies and research centers nationwide.\n\nThe effort is being made across the wide supply-chain spectrum. Reuters reported earlier this month that Chinese scientists are working on a prototype ‍of a machine capable of producing cutting-edge chips, an outcome that Washington has spent years trying to prevent.\n\n\"Before, domestic fabs like SMIC would prefer U.S. equipment and would not really give Chinese firms a chance,\" a former employee at local equipment maker Naura Technology said, referring to the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation.\n\n\"But that changed starting with the 2023 U.S export restrictions, when Chinese fabs had no choice but to work with domestic suppliers.\"",

    "fullText": "Last few months of the year have seen $1tn in value wiped from the market, despite all-time-high price of bitcoin\n\nAs 2025 comes to a close, Donald Trump’s favorable approach to cryptocurrency has not proven to be enough to sustain the industry’s gains, once the source of market-wide optimism and enthusiasm. The last few months of the year have seen $1tn in value wiped from the digital asset market, despite bitcoin hitting an all-time-high price of $126,000 on 6 October.\n\nThe October price peak was short-lived. Bitcoin’s price tumbled just days later after Trump’s announcement of 100% tariffs on China sent shockwaves across the market on 12 October. The crypto market saw $19bn liquidated in 24 hours – the largest liquidation event on record. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, saw a 40% drop in price over the next month. Eric Trump’s own crypto company endured a similar drop in its value in December.\n\nIn Donald Trump, the crypto industry was delivered the pro-bitcoin president they were promised during his campaign. Within days of taking office for the second time, he issued an executive order that repealed restrictions on cryptocurrency and introduced new favorable regulations as well as a presidential working group on digital assets.\n\n“The digital asset industry plays a crucial role in innovation and economic development in the United States, as well as our Nation’s international leadership,” the order read. He placed cryptocurrency front and center in American policy.\n\nAgain in March, Trump announced a new strategic cryptocurrency reserve that fueled a 62% rally in the market prices of three out of five of the coins named to the reserve. Bitcoin, the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency, went up 10% to $94,164 in the hours after the reserve was announced.\n\nCryptocurrency is sensitive to both narratives and confidence in global markets, said Rachael Lucas, the head of marketing and communications at BTC Markets, Australia’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. It’s what is called a risk-on asset, an investment that does better when investors are feeling confident about the economy and are willing to take on more risk, Lucas said.\n\n“The Trump administration may be pro-crypto, but tariffs and tight monetary policy outweigh positive vibes,” said Lucas. “And it’s also just a reminder, especially for people in crypto, that macro forces really matter more than political stances.”\n\nIn November, bitcoin suffered its biggest drop in price since 2021, bringing the coin’s value to less than $81,000. While bitcoin regained some of that value in the weeks after, the digital token started December with another slump, dropping 6% after Strategy, the biggest holder of bitcoin, cut its earnings forecast because of the slide in crypto prices. Bitcoin’s price now hovers near $90,000, up from years past but significantly lower than its peak.\n\nIn the first few days of December 2025, Eric Trump’s crypto firm, American Bitcoin Corp, saw 40% of its value – roughly $1bn – wiped out.\n\nThe Trump family scion put on a bullish face and declared he would ride out the decline. “I’m holding all my @ABTC shares - I’m 100% committed to leading the industry,” Eric Trump said on X at the time.\n\nSome experts fear the industry is entering a so-called crypto winter, a prolonged period of stagnation or losses. The last time, crypto winter lasted from the end of 2021 through 2023, when the FTX mogul Sam Bankman-Fried was tried and convicted. Those years saw bitcoin slump 70% in price.\n\nDespite the optimism fueled by Trump’s win, the current market downturn shows the crypto-friendly administration wasn’t enough to usher in a return to the “retail mania” of 2021, when there was a huge upswing in individual stock trading, said Christian Catalini, the founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab.\n\n“The recent crash isn’t a change in sentiment, but a collision of three structural factors: the aftershocks of a $19bn leverage washout in October; a risk-off rotation driven by US-China tariff tensions; and, crucially, the potential unraveling of the corporate treasury trade,” Catalini said.\n\nAnother potential factor that may have shaken the crypto market is the downturn in share prices of AI stocks like Nvidia, said Lucas.\n\n“One of the reasons why bitcoin is tied to the AI cycle is because a lot of the bitcoin miners actually started leveraging their energy towards new datacenters,” she said. “Not only is crypto a technical asset, we have the miners actually tied into AI devices going up. That negative sentiment tends to sneak into crypto.”\n\nDespite concerns over a crypto winter, notable players in the crypto space Larry Fink, the CEO of investment management firm BlackRock, and Brian Armstrong, the co-founder of Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US, expressed optimism about the long-term value of the currency at a recent New York Times conference. Armstrong said “there was no chance” the price of bitcoin would go to zero and in fact 2025 would be seen as the year “when crypto went from gray market to a well-lit establishment”. Fink, for his part, said his firm had observed “legitimate long owners investing in the currency”, including sovereign wealth funds.\n\nLucas said that this downturn in crypto prices was not inconsistent with past four-year bitcoin cycles and that she was not worried about entering a much more sustained crypto winter.\n\n“If I was looking at it from a traditional bitcoin cycle, we are actually technically in a bear market,” said Lucas. “But as you can see, even with all of these macros that are affecting the market, bitcoin has still managed to set a price above $80,000.”",

    "title": "Is This China’s Truck-Mounted Electromagnetic Catapult?",
    "description": "Having a scalable truck-based catapult concept for land-launched larger drone operations could open up new operational possibilities.",
    "fullText": "New imagery of Chinese catapult-capable low-observable combat drones, or possibly mockups thereof, together with some unusual trucks, may point to plans to launch them from the ground, as well as ships. A modular, truck-mounted electromagnetic catapult system would offer a valuable additional way to launch larger drones, especially in areas with limited access to traditional runways. General Atomics in the United States has proposed a roughly similar concept in the past, leveraging technology developed for the U.S. Navy’s Ford class aircraft carriers.\n\nPictures of the drones sitting dockside at Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard in Shanghai first began circulating online late last week. The presence of the super-sized Type 076 amphibious assault ship Sichuan in drydock nearby still raises the possibility of plans for trials aboard that ship, which features a single electromagnetic catapult, as was discussed in TWZ‘s initial reporting here. A medium-sized cargo ship loaded with containerized vertical launchers, as well as sensors and close-in defense systems, which emerged last week, has also been moored at this yard recently.\n\nThough the drones are still under wraps in the new images, we do now have a better look at their overall design. This includes nose landing gear with bars that clearly show the design is intended for catapult launch. There is also a notable outline of a fairing under the nose, though no further details about that feature can be discerned at present.\n\nIt is interesting to note that a mockup of a drone called the FH-97, shown at China’s Zhuhai Airshow in 2021, was depicted with an electro-optical sensor in a stealthy gold-plated windowed enclosure installed under its nose. The overall design of the FH-97, which is at least heavily inspired by the XQ-58A Valkyrie from U.S. drone maker Kratos, is similar in many other respects, at least in broad strokes, to what has now been seen at the Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard. The XQ-58 and FH-97 are both notably smaller designs. There are also similarities to two Chinese ‘loyal wingman’ type drone designs, commonly referred to presently as the Type C and Type E, which emerged around a huge military parade in Beijing back in September.\n\nWell, back from work and back to this strange picture:\n\nI start with my layman's attempt to sort them a bit + adding the names according to Huitong's CMA-Blog.\n\n1. pic.twitter.com/GPXjD2q1r3\n\n— @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) September 10, 2025\n\nMore interestingly, the new pictures from Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard show at least three eight-wheeled trucks that look designed to lock together seamlessly in a chain. Doing so also appears to form a continuous flat surface across the top. One of the drones is seen loaded at the rear of one of the trucks with its nose gear bar locked into what looks to be a catapult shuttle.\n\nBesides the cabs in front, the sides of the trucks are largely open, showing elaborate electrical systems and large amounts of heavy exposed wiring. There is a cylindrical drum above each wheel, which could be part of an independent articulating suspension system capable of self-leveling. They might also serve another purpose, which we will come back to later on.\n\nA satellite image taken yesterday, which TWZ obtained from Planet Labs, shows what looks to be at least four of the trucks parked close together in a line along one of the piers at Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard. Despite the low resolution, a drone is plainly seen loaded on one of the trucks. Another one of the ‘loyal wingman’ drones is visible immediately behind the row of trucks, in line with what is seen in the pictures taken at ground level. Four more of the swept-wing drones are also visible further down the pier. A Wing Loong-type drone, similar to the Q-1/Q-9 Predator/Reaper series, is also present.\n\nAltogether, there is the potential that these trucks could be part of a mobile ground-based electromagnetic catapult system. The cylinders and wiring seen on the trucks might be electromagnets and/or other supporting components. Any such system would also need to be self-leveling to help ensure a clean launch.\n\nAt the same time, they could still just be transporters, though the design looks far more elaborate than would be required for that purpose alone. The trucks could possibly be designed to serve both functions.\n\nThere is the additional question of why, if this is indeed a ground-based electromagnetic catapult system, it has been brought down to Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard at all. This is not the environment in which one would expect such a system to be employed, and there are no clear signs as of yet that it is there as part of a larger display.\n\nRegardless, the basic idea of employing an aircraft carrier-type catapult launch system on land is not new. China itself, as well as the United States, has built steam and electromagnetic-powered catapults at land-based test sites for test, evaluation, and training purposes. The U.S. Marine Corps actually employed an ‘aircraft carrier on land’ with catapults and arresting gear, called the Short Airfield for Tactical Support (SATS) system, operationally during the Vietnam War, which you can read more about here.\n\nAt least one company in China, Tiantao Technology, has been openly talking about plans for a ground-based electromagnetic catapult system made up of modular wheeled segments since at least August of this year. Renderings have shown 10-wheeled sections that do have some broad similarities to, but that also are distinctly different from the eight-wheeled trucks seen at Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard. The eight-wheeled trucks, if they are part of a mobile electromagnetic catapult system, could also reflect an early developmental iteration.\n\nTiantao Technology has also reportedly said the system will be capable of launching uncrewed aircraft weighing up to around 2.2 tons (two metric tons). This is lighter than the expected takeoff weights of ‘loyal wingman’ type drones China has shown to date, based on the known specifications of comparably-sized Western designs. For example, the stated maximum launch weight of the XQ-58 is three tons, according to Kratos. As another point of comparison, the Chinese GJ-11, a larger flying-wing uncrewed combat air vehicle (UCAV), a catapult-capable version of which is now in development, reportedly has a payload capacity of around two tons. China’s J-15 family of crewed carrier-based fighters, derived from the Su-33 Flanker, each weighs around 19 tons (17.5 metric tons) empty without any fuel or ordnance, as well.\n\nHere are apparently some specs of truck mounted EMALS\n\nCan launch 2T mass with 150kN thrust https://t.co/xoxLOYO0oNpic.twitter.com/vEXM2iSeq4\n\n— Hûrin (@Hurin92) December 29, 2025\n\nIt is possible that the modular design of Tiantao Technology’s ground-based catapult system could allow for configurations capable of launching heavier designs. A core benefit of electromagnetic catapults over steam-powered ones, in general, is their ability to be more fine-tuned in terms of the forces they exert on any aircraft during launch. The capabilities of a modular system would also be dependent on its exact configuration, including how long the catapult track is overall. Tiantao Technology has said the total length of its system could be scaled between roughly 65 and 196 feet (20 and 60 meters). What limitations there might be on simply adding more segments to increase launch capacity are unknown.\n\nChina’s aircraft carrier electromagnetic catapult is incredibly cool — the moment the catapult comes to an instant stop looks like a space jump straight out of a sci-fi movie. pic.twitter.com/VWdLOEzgzS\n\n— JacksonS (@shrmodelx) December 25, 2025\n\nTiantao Technology has also shown models and renderings of truck and trailer-mounted electromagnetic catapults for launching even smaller drones. How much progress it has made in the actual development of any of the systems to date is unclear. Other firms in China could very well be working along similar lines, too.\n\nAll this being said, a ground-based electromagnetic catapult system capable of launching even two-ton drones still opens doors to new operational possibilities. This is a capability that could be especially valuable in expeditionary scenarios or other contexts in which access to traditional runways is limited. A mobile system would also offer a new way to push at least a certain tier of airpower closer to the front lines, and help keep it in close proximity where it could be more responsive, even as the dimensions of the battlefield evolve. Less transit time would translate to more on-station endurance even for smaller, shorter-range drones.\n\nAnother general benefit of electromagnetic catapults over steam-powered types is the shorter reset time, which, by extension, increases sortie generation rates. How Tiantao Technology envisions drones being loaded on its ground-based system is unclear. It is possible that a truck preloaded with a drone could drive up, lock into the rear of the track, launch, and then detach to make way for the next one, offering additional benefits when it comes to operational tempo. Being able to break the launch system into multiple parts and disperse it when not in use would create targeting challenges for enemies and help increase survivability, as well.\n\nAs TWZ regularly notes, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has major standing requirements to be able to conduct island-hopping campaigns against various potential opponents in the Pacific, where a shore-based electromagnetic catapult system could be particularly relevant. The PLA is also postured to fight in highly remote and high-altitude areas along its disputed western border with India, where access to established runways is also often limited.\n\nThese kinds of operational scenarios are driving the pursuit of aircraft, especially uncrewed types, with reduced runway requirements or entirely runway-independent designs by many armed forces globally. This includes the U.S. military. A ground-based electromagnetic catapult is just one way of approaching this operational need. There are runway-independent drones already on the market today that are launched with the help of expendable rocket motors or pneumatic catapults. However, these methods impose their own limitations, especially when it comes to launch weight and payload capacity. Rocket-assisted takeoffs come along with the additional risks associated with using that kind of propellant, as well as the stresses that are imparted on the aircraft being launched. The rockets are also consumed on launch, requiring a steady supply of them at any operating location. Kratos has notably demonstrated a special launch trolley for its primarily rocket-launched XQ-58 that allows for traditional runway takeoffs. The company is also developing a version of that design with built-in landing gear, to offer increased flexibility.\n\nIn the context of what may now be in development in China, there is the additional question about how drones might be recovered after launch from a ground-based electromagnetic catapult. Tiantao Technology does not appear to have elaborated yet on this part of the expected concept of operations for its system. The aforementioned concept that General Atomics put forward paired an electromagnetic catapult with a separate arrested landing system, also based on technology developed for the U.S. Navy’s Ford class aircraft carriers. As noted, the Vietnam War-era SATS system also included arresting gear. The U.S. military and other armed forces globally already employ deployable arresting gear, especially to enable crewed tactical jet operations from far-flung locations with shorter runways. Drones could recover at tertiary bases, or be designed to land via parachute or some other runway-independent method, as well. The system could also be used to launch long-range one-way attack drones that would not be designed for recovery at all.\n\nThere is also a question of power and other logistical requirements. However, a ground-based electromagnetic catapult system that is not required to support all of the different types in a full carrier air wing, especially larger crewed aircraft, would inherently require far less capability.\n\nIt is also worth noting that a modular electromagnetic catapult system might be usable on ships that do not have this capability built into their design. As mentioned, the drones and trucks seen at Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard were spotted near a cargo ship loaded with various containerized weapons and other systems. A drone launch capability of some kind would be a logical addition to a vessel with that configuration. At the same time, whether or not any catapult system made up of multiple segmented components would be stable enough for use on a ship rocking back and forth at sea is unclear.\n\nAs a general note, major new military capabilities often emerge in China during the time between Christmas and New Year’s. This is also something that happens with the clear acquiescence of authorities in Beijing if they are not outright announced through official channels. Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard is an obvious area of interest for observers, and Chinese authorities do not appear to have taken any special steps to conceal the recent appearance of the drone mockups or the trucks.\n\nMore details about the trucks, and their exact function, as well as the drones, may now begin to emerge.\n\nContact the author: joe@twz.com",

    "fullText": "TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — It is a soulful folk song, filled with feeling and history: A love-stricken young man tells God about his hopes and dreams of happiness. Generations of Uyghurs, the Turkic ethnic minority in China’s Xinjiang region, have played it at parties and weddings.\n\nBut today, if they download it, play it or share it online, they risk ending up in prison.\n\n“Besh pede,” a popular Uyghur folk ballad, is among dozens of Uyghur-language songs that have been deemed “problematic” by Xinjiang authorities, according to a recording of a meeting held by police and other local officials in the historic city of Kashgar last October. The recording was shared exclusively with The Associated Press by the Norway-based nonprofit Uyghur Hjelp.\n\nDuring the meeting, authorities warned residents that those who listened to banned songs, stored them on devices or shared them on social media could face prison. Attendees were also instructed to avoid phrases like “As-salamu alaykum,” the greeting common among Muslims, and to replace the popular farewell phrase “Allahqa amanet,” which means “May God keep you safe,” with “May the Communist Party protect you.”\n\nThe policy has been corroborated by interviews with former Xinjiang residents, whose family members, friends and acquaintances have been detained for playing and sharing Uyghur music. AP has also obtained rare access to the court verdict of a Uyghur music producer sentenced last year to three years in prison for uploading to his cloud account songs deemed sensitive.\n\nHow a single song fits into a broad crackdown\n\nThe renewed crackdown on cultural expression in Xinjiang, classified as an “autonomous region” but tightly controlled by the central government, suggests a continuation of the past decade's repressive policies. They have culminated in the extrajudicial detention, between 2017 and 2019, of at least 1 million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in China such as Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and Huis, rights activists and foreign governments say.\n\nIn 2022, the United Nations accused China of rights violations it said might amount to crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, where Beijing also faces allegations of forced labor, forced sterilizations and family separations as part of a broader assimilation campaign.\n\nThe Chinese government maintains its policies in Xinjiang rooted out terrorism and religious extremism after sporadic bouts of violence rocked the region in previous decades. Beijing doubled down on that narrative in particular after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks brought antiterror policies into the accepted global mainstream.\n\n“The Chinese government has cracked down on violent terrorist crimes and eradicated the breeding ground for religious extremism in accordance with the law, resolutely safeguarding Xinjiang’s development and stability,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\n\nIt added that “anti-China forces” have “maliciously hyped up issues related to Xinjiang,” including by “linking audio and video recordings of Xinjiang departments cracking down on the propaganda of violent terrorism and religious extremism in accordance with the law to specific regions, ethnicities, and religions.”\n\nReached by phone, a Xinjiang government official wouldn't confirm whether a faxed request for comment had arrived and did not pick up subsequent calls from AP.\n\nA sign of continued repression in Xinjiang\n\nAfter facing international backlash and sanctions over the alleged arbitrary internment of ethnic minorities, Beijing in late 2019 claimed the detention camps were closed and life had returned to normal in the region. China now aims to refashion Xinjiang into a destination for tourism.\n\nAlthough many of the more glaring signs of repression such as internment camps and frequent traffic checkpoints appear to have been decommissioned, the list of banned songs indicates repression in Xinjiang continues, albeit more subtly, said Rian Thum, a senior lecturer in East Asian history at the University of Manchester.\n\nOther, less conspicuous forms of control include the expansion of boarding schools, where middle-schoolers are educated while separated from their families and learn almost exclusively in Mandarin Chinese, and random checks of phones for sensitive material are common.\n\nChinese authorities, Thum said, seem to be normalizing a policy for long-term control in Xinjiang.\n\n“I’m not at all surprised to hear these accounts of people either being threatened with detention or being detained or imprisoned for listening to the wrong music,” he said. “It’s the kind of thing that hasn’t stopped.”\n\nSeven categories of ‘problematic’ songs\n\nDuring the Kashgar meeting, authorities played a prerecorded message warning residents against listening to, downloading and sharing seven categories of so-called problematic songs.\n\nThey range from traditional folk ballads such as “Besh pede” to newer tunes that emerged from the Uyghur diaspora. “Besh pede” was flagged for its religious content, though the song hardly incites religious extremism, said Rachel Harris, a professor of ethnomusicology at SOAS University of London.\n\nReligion is referenced in the context of romantic tropes, with exhortations such as “Oh, God, I love you!” said Harris, who focuses on Uyghur culture.\n\n“That’s very clearly the problem with it,\" she said.\n\nTargeting religious expression has been a cornerstone of China’s crackdown. The Communist Party is suspicious of any community organizing, especially as it pertains to religions. Over the past decade, residents have been detained for praying, fasting and storing religious books; mosques have been repurposed or stripped of their authentic role.\n\nMusic \"became part of my upbringing, and removing that is like removing the soul,” said Rahima Mahmut, a Uyghur singer and activist in London who performs songs with religious connotations abroad.\n\nEven songs once featured on state TV have been banned. “As-salamu alaykum,” a pop tune that starts with the Islamic greeting recited in the style of a call to prayer, was performed on the talent show “The Voice of the Silk Road,” a spinoff of “The Voice,” on state-run Xinjiang Television.\n\nThe performance aired in 2016, the year China started amping up its campaign of repression against Uyghurs. Now, the tune is prohibited for “forcing people to believe in religion.”\n\nAnother category of problematic songs: those “inciting terrorism, extremism and smearing the Chinese Communist Party’s rule of Xinjiang.” Among the tunes listed is “Yanarim Yoq,” a song based on the poem “No Road Back Home” by the imprisoned Uyghur poet Abduqadir Jalalidin. The sorrowful song, evoking entrapment and hopelessness, has spread across the diaspora in recent years; one of its most popular renditions is performed by the Turkish artists Kilich and Yenilmes.\n\n“Atilar,” or “Forefathers,” by the famed Uyghur musician Abdurehim Heyit, is also accused of inciting terrorism and extremism. The nationalistic song was likely flagged for describing the Uyghur forefathers as martyrs ready for battle, Harris said.\n\nHeyit, like many other Uyghur cultural elites, was detained at the height of China’s campaign in Xinjiang. Many remain in detention.\n\nIn fact, a common denominator across the banned songs is that many were written or performed by imprisoned Uyghur musicians, said Elise Anderson, a nonresident senior fellow at the New Lines Institute who specializes in Uyghur issues.\n\nAnderson isn't certain that every artist associated with a banned song has been detained, but “at least a number of them have,” she said. “I think just by association with those individuals, those songs are going to be seen as — you know — dangerous, sensitive.”\n\nThree years in prison for uploading songs\n\nAuthorities at the Kashgar meeting said those found with the songs would be “heavily prosecuted” but did not specify punishment — something that gives authorities flexibility in enforcement. The prerecorded message gave the example of several people who had served 10 days in detention for being found with the banned songs.\n\nFor Uyghur music producer Yashar Xiaohelaiti, punishment has been much more severe.\n\nThe 27-year-old was detained in 2023 in Bole, a city in Xinjiang, on charges of promoting extremism. According to his verdict, Xiaohelaiti wrote and produced 42 “problematic” songs, which he uploaded to his account on NetEase Cloud Music, a Chinese streaming service. He was also convicted of downloading eight “problematic” e-books, according to the document. He received three years in prison and a 3,000 yuan ($420) fine.\n\nTwo Uyghurs interviewed by AP said they brushed up against the songs ban themselves. A man who asked that his name not be revealed, fearing repercussions, said he was called into the police station and his phone searched after he commented on the social media post of another Uyghur living abroad. While at the police station, he said he spoke to others who had been summoned specifically for storing or sharing certain Uyghur songs.\n\nSeparately, a former official from Xinjiang said a family friend was sentenced to more than 10 years in prison for playing traditional Uyghur instruments and singing Uyghur songs. Several family members and friends who watched the performance were also sentenced, she said. AP could not independently verify the interviewees’ claims.\n\nIn a separate incident, the official said two teenagers were detained after sharing Uyghur songs online.\n\n“Because they sent each other a Uyghur song on WeChat, they were arrested,” the former cadre said, referring to the teens. “I remember it very clearly. At the time we were saying, ‘What song were they listening to?’ How could they be arrested for listening to a song?’”\n\nAP journalist Dake Kang in Beijing contributed to this story.",

    "description": "China is weighing new controls on AI training, requiring consent before chat logs can be used to improve chatbots and virtual companions.",
    "fullText": "China is moving to tighten one of the most common ways AI systems improve: Learning directly from conversations with users.\n\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China said in a statement published Saturday that it has drafted measures that would restrict how AI platforms can collect and use chat logs for model training.\n\nThe proposal aims to ensure that \"human-like\" interactive AI services, including chatbots and virtual companions, are safe and secure for users, the statement said.\n\nChina encourages innovation in \"human-like\" interactive AI, but will pair that with governance and prudent, tiered supervision to \"prevent abuse and loss of control,\" it added.\n\nUnder the draft rules, platforms would need to inform users when they are interacting with AI and provide options to access or delete their chat history. Using conversation data for model training — or sharing it with third parties — would require explicit user consent, the agency said.\n\nFor minors, providers would need additional consent from a guardian before sharing their conversation data with third parties. Guardians would also have the right to request deletion of a minor's chat history.\n\nThe draft measures are open for public consultation, with feedback due in late January.\n\nIf finalized, the rules could slow the pace at which AI chatbots improve, Lian Jye Su, the chief analyst at Omdia, a technology research and consulting firm, told Business Insider.\n\nRestricting access to chat logs may \"limit the human-feedback mechanisms in reinforcement learning, which has been critical to the rise of engaging and accurate conversational AI,\" Su said.\n\nThat said, China's AI ecosystem is \"robust,\" and the country has access to massive public and proprietary datasets, he added.\n\nSu said the move aligns with Beijing's broader emphasis on national security and the collective public interest. Tightening controls over chat logs signals that certain user conversations are too sensitive to be treated as free training data, he added.\n\nWei Sun, the principal analyst for AI at Counterpoint Research, told Business Insider these provisions \"function less as brakes and more as directional signals.\"\n\n\"The emphasis is on protecting users and preventing opaque data practices, rather than constraining innovation,\" she said.\n\nSun said the draft encourages providers — once safety and reliability are proven — to expand the use of human-like AI across more application areas, including cultural dissemination and companionship for older adults.\n\n\"In the context of a rapidly aging population, they can be read as an explicit policy nudge to accelerate the development of human-like AI interactions in a regulated, socially constructive, and scalable manner,\" she added.\n\nChina's new draft rules on chatlog data come as concerns grow over how AI companies handle deeply personal user conversations.\n\nBusiness Insider reported in August that contract workers employed by Meta and other tech giants can read user conversations with chatbots as part of the process of evaluating AI responses.\n\nSeveral contractors told Business Insider that the material they reviewed contained sensitive details that could be used to identify individual users. Many of the conversations were highly personal, including exchanges that resembled therapy sessions, private chats with close friends, or intimate conversations with romantic partners.\n\nMeta's AI terms of service said that it \"may review\" user chatlogs with its AI products, either through automated systems or human reviewers.\n\nA Meta spokesperson told Business Insider that the company has \"strict policies\" over who can access personal data.\n\n\"While we work with contractors to help improve training data quality, we intentionally limit what personal information they see, and we have processes and guardrails in place instructing them how to handle any such information they may encounter,\" the spokesperson said in the August report.\n\nA Google engineer in AI security told Business Insider earlier this month that there are certain things he would never share with chatbots.\n\n\"AI models use data to generate helpful responses, and we users need to protect our private information so that harmful entities, like cybercriminals and data brokers, can't access it,\" he said.",

    "description": "China says the drills are a stern warning to pro-independence forces, but they look a lot like a practice run.",
    "fullText": "Beijing is calling its massive war games around Taiwan this week a stern warning; however, they are also practice, offering insight into how China is thinking about a war for the island.\n\nThe big military exercise, \"Justice Mission-2025,\" that kicked off Monday is the latest large-scale Chinese drill aimed at preparing the People's Liberation Army for action such as bringing combined arms to bear against Taiwan, seizing control of the skies, isolating and assaulting the island, and combating foreign interference.\n\nChina mobilized its army, navy, air, and rocket forces for drills around Taiwan with a focus on combat readiness in the sea and air, blocking off key ports and areas, and what it said was \"all-dimensional deterrence outside the island chain.\"\n\nOn the southeast side of the island, China's military has been using bombers and anti-ship missiles against mock maritime targets, clearing the way for the navy's amphibious assault ships. The exercises, China's Eastern Theater Command said, are testing how well air and naval forces operate together. There was also an emphasis on eliminating targets at \"maximum range,\" key to cutting risk and keeping hostile forces at arm's length.\n\nTo the north and southwest of Taiwan, the Chinese military's destroyers, frigates, fighters, bombers, and drones, together with the long-range rocket forces, have been practicing coordinated seizure and dominance, pursuing training targets on land, at sea, and in the air, the way it might in a real fight.\n\nIn recent years, China has put greater emphasis on more realistic training.\n\nIn the air, Chinese fighters, airborne early warning aircraft, and electronic warfare planes have been training to effectively secure air superiority, while action at sea has been focused on defeating both surface ships and submarines.\n\n\"With vessels and aircraft approaching Taiwan island in close proximity from different directions,\" a command spokesperson said, \"troops of multiple services engage in joint assaults to test their joint operations capabilities.\"\n\nVideo shared by the Eastern Theater Command showed preparations for the drills, including trucks carrying missiles, fighter jets and other aircraft, and warship activity.\n\n🇨🇳 🇹🇼 🪖China holds large-scale combat exercises east of Taiwan\n\nThe drills held by the People's Liberation Army’s Eastern Theater Command were aimed at testing joint sea–air coordination, precise target detection, and rapid neutralization capabilities. pic.twitter.com/2veIz926ZJ\n\nThe training isn't entirely simulated and includes live-fire activities against mock targets. The live-fire exercises will take place in five maritime and airspace zones around Taiwan.\n\nChina's coast guard is also on patrol in the waters surrounding Taiwan. The island's defense ministry said on Monday afternoon that it had detected 14 Chinese navy warships and 14 coast guard vessels around Taiwan and outlying islands. Additionally, 89 aircraft, including J-10 and J-16 fighters, JH-7 fighter-bombers, and KJ-500 early warning and control planes, had been detected around Taiwan as well. None of the ships or planes violated Taiwan's territorial airspace or waters.\n\nTaiwan's defense ministry said that the island has been conducting its own rapid response drills amid the Chinese exercise.\n\nThe drills show how China's military plans to use its current forces in a coordinated attack, but in official releases, there were also indications about its future ambitions. On Monday, China released an artificial intelligence-made short video on a Taiwan fight.\n\nThe video showed various animals, like eagles and bees, transforming into uncrewed aerial vehicles, sea creatures becoming warships, and wolves turning into uncrewed ground robots. The AI-generated video, titled \"Joint Operations to Thwart 'Taiwan Independence' Attempts,\" also featured a pack of humanoid drones carrying rifles and walking through a war-torn city.\n\n🇨🇳 PLA Eastern Theater Command releases AI propaganda video 《联武群戈斩“独”道》(Joint Operations to Thwart ‘Taiwan Independence’ Attempts) https://t.co/gKUa2CanWJ pic.twitter.com/l0fUHtVVVp\n\nThe propaganda video, despite its artistic styling and the featuring of some technology not currently known to exist, suggests China is aiming for an integrated approach using a range of uncrewed systems and advanced capabilities, like submarines and warships and aircraft.\n\nCombining assets has been an important part of the latest military drills. Effectively integrating wide-ranging combat capabilities for combined arms warfare is a challenging feat though.",

    "fullText": "Asia In Brief China’s Cyberspace Administration on Saturday posted draft rules governing the behaviour of AI companions that prohibit using them to serve as friends for the elderly.\n\nThe draft “Interim Measures for the Administration of Humanized Interactive Services Based on Artificial Intelligence” opens with a suggestion that China needs regulations to ensure the healthy development of AIs that “engage in emotional interaction with humans.”\n\nAs is always the case with China’s tech regulations, the draft calls for providers of companion AIs to ensure they are secure, don’t expose users to fraud, encrypt data, and reflect core socialist values. It also includes a requirement for parental controls, and for protection of data that describes minors.\n\nOne Article in the draft addresses how AI companions interact with the elderly:\n\nProviders shall guide elderly people to set up emergency contact persons for their services. If any elderly person is found to be in danger of losing their life, health or property during the use of the service, the provider shall promptly notify the emergency contact person and provide social and psychological assistance or emergency relief channels.\n\nProviders are prohibited from providing services that simulate the relatives or specific relationships of elderly users.\n\nThe draft also calls for AI companions to remind users they are not interacting with a human every two hours, and for providers of such systems to provide advance notice of outages.\n\nAlso among the draft requirements are calls for “mental health protection, emotional boundary guidance, and dependency risk warning, and should not use replacing social interaction, controlling users' psychology, or inducing addiction as design goals.”\n\nThe draft also prohibits using data gathered during interaction with AI companies to train models.\n\nThe Cyberspace Administration wants feedback on the draft by January 25th.\n\nAustralia’s Department of Defence has tapped Google for an “enhanced, secure and air-gapped hyperscale cloud capability.”\n\n“Defence will have access to advanced global cloud solutions to deliver key sovereign capabilities,” states the department’s announcement of the deal. “The technology will support faster rollout of critical systems, ongoing upgrades and improved cooperation with international partners, while ensuring Australia retains control of critical Defence assets.”\n\nAustralia’s government already has a deal with AWS to operate three datacenters dedicated to government workloads, including information rated as the nation’s “most classified data.”\n\nThe Department said the sensitivities of the Google deal mean it will “refrain from providing further commentary … with all specific details remaining strictly confidential.”\n\nJapan’s Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has published its initial analysis of the failed launch of its H3 rocket last week.\n\nThe agency found that when the rocket’s fairing separated, pressure in a fuel tank fell. When the engine that used the fuel tank ignited, it produced around 80 percent of expected pressure.\n\nThe rocket’s second stage and payload therefore could not reach the intended orbit. The report suggests both fell into Earth’s atmosphere and burned up safely.\n\n57 percent of components present in Huawei smartphones are now made in China, according to a product teardown reported by Japanese outlet Nikkei.\n\nWorking with Japanese teardown service Fomalhaut Techno Solutions, Nikkei analyzed the content of 2024’s Mate 70 Pro and this year’s Pura 80 Pro, and found 57 percent of components in both were made in China, and that those parts accounted for 60 percent of the phone’s value.\n\nNikkei reports that just 19 percent of components in Huawei’s 2020 models came from China, rising to 32 percent in 2023.\n\nPapua New Guinea’s (PNG’s) National Information & Communications Technology Authority has warned signatories to a petition calling for Starlink to be licensed for operations in the country that they risk prosecution.\n\nPNG is a rugged country with poor telecommunications infrastructure – a fine fit for Starlink’s satellite broadband service. Local netizens have campaigned for PNG to license Starlink, suggesting they email NICTA to express support for Starlink.\n\nOn December 16th NICTA demanded Starlink suspend services to the country.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, NICTA published a list of petitioners and warned “Individuals who have signed or participated in the petition may be regarded as potential offenders, and NICTA will not hesitate to pursue appropriate regulatory and legal action where non-compliance is established.”\n\nStarlink has since ended service in PNG.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — China's military on Monday dispatched air, navy and missile units to conduct joint live-fire drills around the island of Taiwan, which Beijing called a “stern warning” against separatist and “external interference” forces. Taiwan said it was placing forces on alert and called the Chinese government “the biggest destroyer of peace.”\n\nTaiwan’s aviation authority said more than 100,000 international air travelers would be affected by flight cancellations or diversions.\n\nThe drills came after Beijing expressed anger at what could be the largest-ever U.S. arms sale to the self-ruled territory, and at a statement by Japan’s prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, saying its military could get involved if China takes action against Taiwan. China says Taiwan must come under its rule.\n\nChina's military did not mention the United States and Japan in its statement on Monday, but Beijing's foreign ministry accused Taiwan's ruling party of trying to seek independence through requesting U.S. support.\n\nTaiwan’s Defense Ministry said rapid response exercises were underway, with forces on high alert. “The Chinese Communist Party’s targeted military exercises further confirm its nature as an aggressor and the biggest destroyer of peace,” it said.\n\nBeijing sends warplanes and navy vessels toward the island on a near-daily basis, and in recent years it has stepped up the scope and scale of the exercises.\n\nSenior Col. Shi Yi, spokesperson of China's People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command, said the drills would be conducted in the Taiwan Strait and areas to the north, southwest, southeast and east of the island.\n\nShi said activities would focus on sea-air combat readiness patrol, “joint seizure of comprehensive superiority” and blockades on key ports. It was the first large-scale military drill where the command publicly mentioned one goal was “all-dimensional deterrence outside the island chain.\"\n\n“It is a stern warning against ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces and external interference forces, and it is a legitimate and necessary action to safeguard China’s sovereignty and national unity,” Shi said.\n\nChina and Taiwan have been governed separately since 1949, when a civil war brought the Communist Party to power in Beijing. Defeated Nationalist Party forces fled to Taiwan. The island has operated since then with its own government, though the mainland’s government claims it as sovereign territory.\n\nDrills will continue on Tuesday\n\nChina's command on Monday deployed destroyers, frigates, fighters, bombers and unmanned aerial vehicles, alongside long-range rockets, to the north and southwest of the Taiwan Strait. It carried out live-fire exercises against targets in the waters. Among other training, drills to test the capabilities of sea-air coordination and precise target hunting were conducted in the waters and airspace to the east of the strait.\n\nHsieh Jih-sheng, deputy chief of the general staff for intelligence of the Taiwanese Defense Ministry, said that as of 3 p.m. Monday, 89 aircraft and drones were operating around the strait, with 67 of them entering the “response zone\" — airspace under the force's monitoring and response. The ministry detected 14 navy ships around the strait and four other warships in the Western Pacific, in addition to 14 coast guard vessels.\n\n“Conducting live-fire exercises around the Taiwan Strait ... does not only mean military pressure on us. It may bring more complex impact and challenges to the international community and neighboring countries,” Hsieh told reporters.\n\nMilitary drills are set to continue Tuesday. Taiwan's Civil Aviation Administration said Chinese authorities had issued a notice saying seven temporary dangerous zones would be set up around the strait to carry out rocket-firing exercises from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., barring aircraft from entering them.\n\nThe Taiwanese aviation authority said more than 850 international flights were initially scheduled during that period and the drills would affect over 100,000 travelers. Over 80 domestic flights, involving around 6,000 passengers, were also canceled, it added.\n\nCommercial airlines began to announce dozens of cancellations and delays for domestic routes across Taiwan, particularly ones along islands near China.\n\nThe Chinese command released themed posters about the drills online accompanied by provocative wording. One depicted two shields with the Great Wall alongside three military aircraft and two ships. Its social media post said the drills were about the “Shield of Justice, Smashing Illusion,\" adding that any foreign interlopers or separatists touching the shields would be eliminated.\n\nLast week, Beijing imposed sanctions against 20 U.S. defense-related companies and 10 executives, a week after Washington announced large-scale arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion. It still requires approval by the U.S. Congress.\n\nUnder U.S. federal law in place for many years, Washington is obligated to assist Taipei with its defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China. The U.S. and Taiwan had formal diplomatic relations until 1979, when President Jimmy Carter’s administration recognized and established relations with Beijing.\n\nAsked about the drills, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party has attempted \"to seek independence by soliciting U.S. support and even risk turning Taiwan into a powder keg and ammunition depot.”\n\n“External forces’ attempts to use Taiwan to contain China and to arm Taiwan will only embolden the Taiwan independence forces and push the Taiwan Strait toward a dangerous situation of military confrontation and war,” he said.\n\nThere was no immediate U.S. statement on the drills.\n\nKaren Kuo, spokesperson for the Taiwanese president's office, said the drills were undermining the stability and security of the Taiwan Strait and Indo-Pacific region and openly challenging international law and order.\n\n“Our country strongly condemns the Chinese authorities for disregarding international norms and using military intimidation to threaten neighboring countries.” she said.\n\nTaiwan's Defense Ministry released a video that featured its weapons and forces in a show of resilience. Multiple French Mirage-2000 aircraft conducted landings at an air force base.\n\nIn October, the Taiwanese government said it would accelerate the building of a “Taiwan Shield” or “T-Dome” air defense system in the face of the military threat from China.\n\nThe military tensions came a day after Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an said he hoped the Taiwan Strait would be associated with peace and prosperity, instead of “crashing waves and howling winds,\" during a trip to Shanghai.",

    "description": "Silver prices rose as high as $84 an ounce as talk of an arbitrage play on China's pure-play silver fund gained traction on social media.",
    "fullText": "It's been a wild few weeks for silver.\n\nThe precious metal was already on a record-breaking run this year, and recently got a further boost from speculative interest among Chinese retail investors.\n\nThe price of the metal climbed to a new all-time high of $84 an ounce on Monday before erasing gains and trading lower.\n\nSilver, which is a key component in data centers and is seen as an under-the-radar AI play, has been piquing the interest of investors all year.\n\nBut speculative buying in China started just a couple of weeks ago, when a string of posts on the social media platform Xiaohongshu outlined how investors could start an arbitrage play on the UBS SDIC Silver Futures Fund, China's pure-play silver fund. (Arbitrage is a strategy that enables a trader to capitalize on the price difference of the same asset across different markets.)\n\nThat strategy evidently gained traction. In the past week, the fund was valued at over a 60% premium compared to the value of its assets, and at one point, was up 187% from levels at the start of the year, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nThis spike in Chinese interest can be seen in the spread between spot silver prices in Shanghai and in London, which briefly rose to more than $8 an ounce on Monday, the largest premium the metal has ever posted in China, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nOn Friday, UBS SDIC said it would shutter subscriptions to the fund's Class C shares, which are preferred among short-term traders. It also advised traders to avoid chasing \"unsustainable\" gains, and said rules around trading would become tighter.\n\nUBS SDIC did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider.\n\nIt looks like there's a large number of speculators in net-short positions in silver, said Jeff de Graaf, a technical analyst and the CEO of Renaissance Macro.\n\n\"Net-short positions are negatively correlated to forward returns implying a potential short squeeze of speculators in silver markets,\" he wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\n\nIt isn't the first time silver has been the object of investor speculation. In October, silver futures hit a fresh record in London as traders staged a short squeeze on the metal, pushing its price to its first record high in over forty years.",

    "fullText": "The Chinese flag is seen during sunset on Pingtan island, the closest point to Taiwan, in eastern China's Fujian province on December 29, 2025. Credit - Adek Berry—AFP/Getty Images\n\nChina launched extensive military drills near Taiwan on Monday in what it called a “stern warning” against separatist and “external interference” forces after the Trump Administration announced an $11.1 billion arms sale to the island earlier this month.\n\nThe Chinese military’s “Justice Mission 2025” exercises—the first major drills it has held around the island since April—are to include combat-readiness and port-blockade drills, complete with live fire and simulated land and sea strikes, along seven zones across the island, in part to deter outside intervention, China’s Eastern Theater Command announced.\n\nTaiwan has been self-governed since 1949, after Nationalist forces fled to the island following their defeat by Chinese Communist powers. But China has maintained that it has sovereignty over Taiwan and long called for a “reunification” between the smaller territory and the People’s Republic of China.\n\nSenior Col. Shi Yi, spokesperson of the Eastern Theater Command, said the drills were a “stern warning against ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces and external interference forces” and described the military action as a “necessary” move to protect China’s \"sovereignty and national unity.”\n\nTaiwan’s Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said the exercises “further confirm” the Chinese Communist Party’s “nature as an aggressor and the biggest destroyer of peace.”\n\nIn the drills, China is operating dozens of aircraft and drones around the Taiwan Strait, according to the deputy chief of the general staff for intelligence for the Taiwanese Defense Ministry, Hsieh Jih-sheng. More than 100,000 travelers on international flights were set to be affected by the Chinese military’s actions, per the island’s Transport Ministry.\n\nMilitary drills are expected to continue through Tuesday, Taiwan’s Civil Aviation Administration said.\n\nThe exercises come as China has expressed ire over the recent $11.1 billion U.S. arms sale to Taiwan, which includes high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS) and harpoon missile repair related equipment. The U.S. previously approved more than $1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan in November.\n\nLast week, the Chinese foreign ministry enacted sanctions against 20 U.S. defense firms in the wake of the sales, barring companies such as Boeing from doing business with the global superpower. Ten executives for those companies were also barred from entering China or doing business in the country under the sanctions.\n\nThe State Department notified Congress that it had approved the large-scale sale to Taiwan less than two weeks ago, saying that the potential deal “serves U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.\"\n\n“The proposed sale[s] will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance and economic progress in the region,” the department’s statement continued.\n\nTaiwan’s presidential office stated at the time that it was “sincerely grateful” for the announced sale, while China quickly condemned it, asserting that it undermined Chinese sovereignty and security and disrupted peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.",

    "description": "China and USMCA trade stand apart as special cases tied to security and policy.",
    "fullText": "Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said the Trump administration's trade policy is showing signs of de-escalation after a year in which tariffs unsettled businesses.\n\n\"If you go back to where we were in April, there was a lot of lack of understanding about where this would end up, and that affected small businesses and medium-sized businesses,\" Moynihan said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation,\" which aired Sunday.\n\nSince returning to office, President Donald Trump has rolled out a 10% baseline tariff on imports, alongside higher rates for certain countries and product-specific duties such as those on automobiles.\n\nBut what initially disrupted planning and purchasing decisions is now becoming clearer, Moynihan said, with Bank of America's internal outlook pointing toward a broad tariff floor.\n\nAs negotiations progressed, Moynihan said tariffs have begun clustering around roughly 15% for many countries, with higher levels reserved for those that decline to buy US goods or ease non-tariff barriers.\n\n\"To go from a 10% across the board, to 15% for the broad base of countries, not a huge impact,\" Moynihan said.\n\n\"And that's where our team says it's starting to de-escalate,\" he added.\n\nChina, however, is an exception, Moynihan said.\n\n\"China's a different question, because the national security interests, the rare earth minerals, the magnets, batteries, just AI, all that stuff. It's a very different case.\"\n\nMoynihan also flagged North American trade as its own track, saying \"the USMCA, which has to be redone, is also a different case\" — a reference to the agreement's scheduled review next year.\n\nFor smaller firms, Moynihan suggested that the current challenge hasn't just been the tariff rate itself, even as interest rates have come down over the past year.\n\n\"So they're more their issue right now is, can I get the labor I need to do, to bid the contracts, to do the work I'm doing?\" he said, pointing to immigration policies as a source of concern.\n\n\"It's not that they agree with them or are disagreeing. They just need to have the answer, and that's what they're looking for.\"",

That put SpaceX on alert and LandSpace is now preparing to go public ​to fund its future projects, just as its bigger and far more successful U.S. rival considers an initial public offering of its own.\n\nEven though LandSpace's ‌Zhuque-3 rocket test ended in failure, its aspiration to become second only to SpaceX in reusable rockets is providing a fresh impetus to China's space industry, which has long been dominated by risk-averse, state-owned entities.\n\n\"(SpaceX) ‌can push products to the edge and even into failure, quickly identifying limits and iterating,\" Zhuque-3 chief designer Dai Zheng told state broadcaster CCTV after the rocket's inaugural flight.\n\nDai said his decision in 2016 to join LandSpace and leave the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, the country's main state-owned rocket developer, was partly motivated by SpaceX's focus on reusability and his desire to create a Chinese equivalent.\n\nLandSpace's focus on giving China its own low-cost launch option similar to SpaceX's flight-proven reusable rocket Falcon 9 will play a key role ⁠in Beijing's plans to build up 10,000 satellite constellations in ‌the coming decades.\n\n\"Falcon 9 is a successful configuration that has been tested by engineering,\" Zhuque-3's deputy chief designer Dong Kai said in a podcast interview last week. \"After studying it, we recognize its rationality; this is learning, not imitation.\"\n\n\"Calling (Zhuque-3) a 'Chinese Falcon 9,' I think, is a ‍very high compliment.\"\n\nIts startup culture and mimicking of SpaceX has already initiated a paradigm shift in China's space industry.\n\nChina's state-led space programme has historically been allergic to failed launches, in contrast to SpaceX and other Western firms that regularly broadcast their mishaps.\n\nBut earlier this month, state media covered China's first two failed attempts at recovering a reusable rocket, with the second launch ​coming from a state-owned firm, just three weeks after Zhuque-3's maiden flight.\n\nLandSpace also opened its engine factory floor to Reuters this month, allowing foreign media to take ‌a peek at one of its core assets for the first time.\n\nAfter opening up the space sector to private money in 2014, which spawned several startups including LandSpace, Beijing is now looking to help leading domestic players tap into capital markets by making it easier for them to pursue IPOs.",

It was FAST & DECISIVE, as all of these situations should be!” Trump wrote.\n\nThe talks in China aim to ensure a sustained ceasefire and promote lasting peace between the countries, according to a statement by Sihasak’s office.\n\nWang was scheduled to join both bilateral meetings with each of the diplomats and a trilateral talk on Monday.\n\nChina has welcomed the ceasefire announcement, which freezes the front lines and allows for displaced civilians to return to their homes near the border.\n\n“China stands ready to continue to provide (the) platform and create conditions for Cambodia and Thailand to have fuller and more detailed communication,” a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement read.\n\nThe ceasefire agreement comes with a 72-hour observation period, at the end of which Thailand agreed to repatriate 18 Cambodian soldiers it has held as prisoners since earlier fighting in July. Their release has been a major demand of the Cambodian side.\n\nPrak Sokhonn, in a statement after his meeting with Wang, expressed deep appreciation for China’s “vital role” in supporting the ceasefire.\n\nChina also announced 20 million yuan ($2.8 million) of emergency humanitarian aid for Cambodia to assist the displaced.\n\nThe first batch of Chinese aid, including food, tents and blankets, arrived in Cambodia on Sunday, Wang Wenbin, Chinese ambassador to Cambodia, wrote on Facebook.\n\nSihasak said Sunday he hoped the meetings would convey to China that it should both support a sustainable ceasefire and send a signal to Cambodia against reviving the conflict or attempting to create further ones.\n\n“Thailand does not see China merely as a mediator in our conflict with Cambodia but wants China to play a constructive role in ensuring a sustainable ceasefire by sending such signals to Cambodia as well,” he said.",

This supercritical carbon dioxide power generator provides a clean energy solution and advances China's pollution-reduction efforts.\n\nThe company connected its generator to the grid at a steel plant in Guizhou province. There, it will capture waste heat from steel production and directly convert it into electricity.\n\nThe company expects the generator to be 50% more efficient than currently available technologies. Therefore, it also serves as a model for other power plants and industrial applications worldwide.\n\nThis energy development is encouraging because it contributes to the clean energy mix and is a substantial step forward for advanced nuclear technology. It offers high power in a small footprint, making it suitable for spacecrafts, ships, and other confined spaces.\n\n\"The Chinese are moving very, very fast. They are very keen to show the world that their program is unstoppable,\" Mark Hibbs, an expert on the nuclear sector, told The New York Times.\n\nNuclear energy is often misunderstood and controversial, yet it's an important part of the sustainable energy transition away from more polluting energy sources and toward cheaper, clear forms of energy, like wind and solar.\n\nNuclear plants are also known for radioactive leaks and producing hazardous waste. Safety and environmental concerns are valid. However, they still offer a promising shift away from pollution-heavy coal, oil, and gas.\n\nYet, recent developments from the CNNC and partner Jigang International Engineering and Technology Co. are paving the way for nuclear expansion in the country and beyond.\n\nChina is now seeking to scale up its new power-generation systems to deploy them in nuclear, steel, and solar plants.\n\nShould America invest \n\nOnly if it helps us compete with China\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "title": "There's no silver bullet to the US Navy's shipbuilding woes: report",
    "description": "The US Navy is struggling to compete with China due to a spate of failed ship classes. A new report warns there's no easy fix.",
    "fullText": "The US Navy faces a number of challenges in its goal of growing the fleet. None are easily or quickly solvable.\n\nA new report from naval and defense policy experts assesses that a number of actions are urgently needed across shipbuilders and the government to fix the Navy's delays and cost overruns, especially as China's fleet surpasses the US' in size and adopts new technologies to become a dominant naval power.\n\nMany of the Navy's problems, including retiring more ships than it is building, a slowed and expensive shipbuilding process with only a handful of commercial shipyards, and program mismanagement, trace back to the end of the Cold War. They've gotten worse in the decades since and are reaching a boiling point as the US military attempts to focus on countering China's military rise.\n\n\"Despite the Navy's plans for growing the fleet and bipartisan efforts and funding from Congress, the US shipbuilding enterprise — including the Navy, Department of Defense, Congress, and industry — has failed to consistently produce ships at the scale, speed, and cost demanded,\" authors of the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, or CSIS, report wrote.\n\nAmong the failed projects: Two types of littoral combat ships, an advanced stealth destroyer the service will only have three of, and the newly canceled Constellation-class frigate.\n\nNo one entity, incident, or program is solely to blame. Washington's demand signal for building new vessels has been inconsistent, leaving shipbuilders unable to plan long-term projects. And the Navy's requirement process and ship designs have sometimes resulted in vessels not meeting expectations, being delayed by years, and coming in far over budget.\n\nRight now, Navy Secretary John Phelan, officials in DoD, and shipyards are focused on fixing these problems and avoiding the same mistakes in the future. Shipbuilding is a top priority, and it's gotten a lot of attention throughout the first year of the second Trump administration.\n\nBut, per the report, there is no single solution to arrest the decline in American shipbuilding, \"and resolving any one of the underlying issues does not guarantee a drastic improvement of the situation.\" Instead, the Navy, Congress, and shipyards will have to find the right way forward through years of work.\n\nThe Navy's battle force, including surface ships, submarines, and aircraft carriers, peaked during the build-up in the second Reagan administration at 568. After the Cold War, the number dwindled, as the US focused on land wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; the fleet hit its low point of 271 in 2015. A year later, the Navy released plans of a 355-ship goal, which increased in 2023 under the Biden administration to 381 and 134 large uncrewed surface and underwater vehicles.\n\nThese goals have proven unreachable without an effective small warship whose price tag is well below $13 billion Ford-class aircraft carriers and $2 billion guided-missile destroyers.\n\nCompared to the US, China has amassed a huge fleet over the last 25 years. Thanks to its state-owned shipbuilders and dual-use commercial and military shipyards, equipment, and workforce, China's fleet reached a height of an estimated 370 battle force ships last year. China's naval growth has alarmed officials even if they are not all a match for the US' highly advanced, well-built vessels and weapons.\n\nNavy officials have increasingly looked at uncrewed vessels to rapidly add new capabilities to the fleet. A mix of large, medium, and small drone boats would be useful for a number of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, and could expand the Navy's reach in regions like the Indo-Pacific while keeping sailors out of harm's way. Companies can build these autonomous vessels fast but questions remain on how effective drone ships are; the few operational drone boats today largely act as surveillance vessels. It's still a relatively new field, but it could present short-term answers to fleet problems by reducing the demand for crewed ships.\n\nThe Navy's current fleet has also seen a higher tempo of operations, putting \"greater stress on the fleet and its crews as a smaller number of ships must deploy more regularly to mission demands, thereby increasing the need for greater maintenance and sustainment,\" the CSIS report noted.\n\nEarlier this year, then-acting Chief of Naval Operations Adm. James Kilby said the Navy was clocking in at a 68% readiness rate for surface ships and 67% for submarines, while aviation stands at 70%. The service aims for 80% by 2027.\n\nPart of the disparity stems from ship maintenance delays. The US's current capacity to keep its fleet running has been strained across shipyards, resulting in repairs often taking 20% to 100% longer than estimated, according to a new Congressional Budget Office analysis. There are many causes for that: the average age of the Navy's ships is older than it used to be and require more work and the scope of maintenance is often larger than anticipated.\n\nKeeping older vessels ready is one challenge but the Navy's goals of building new ones has continued to face hurdles with increased construction times, holdups across major programs, and cost overruns. In a US Government Accountability Office report earlier this year, the government watchdog agency assessed that 37 of the 45 battle force ships under construction were delayed as of fall 2024.\n\nThat's been blamed on several things, including the Navy's focus on price in contracting rather than speed, rising prices for ships due to purchasing fewer hulls, and changes to ship designs and capabilities during construction. The recently cancelled Constellation-class frigate is a prime example of how design changes can doom a program by causing delays and soaring costs. The frigate was originally supposed to have 80% commonality with its Italian navy version but only ended up with 15%.\n\nOn the industry side, the shipbuilding sector has shrunk and largely serves to build ships for the Navy and Coast Guard and a few merchant ships; most commercial shipbuilding has shifted to countries like Japan, South Korea, and China, where they are cheaper to build.\n\nWashington, the Navy, and shipbuilders are pursuing several avenues to address these problems. Billions are being invested in the industrial base, with a major focus on submarines, and broader initiatives are focused on training the next generation of workers. Modernization efforts in shipyards, including automation, artificial intelligence, and robotics, are a priority as well to drive down costs.\n\nGiven the vast lead and advantages of competitors like South Korea and China, it's these could drive down ship production costs. But they are unlikely to revitalize a commercial ship industry that can be converted to war-time use, as occurred in World War II.\n\nBut the issues afflicting American shipbuilding are complex. \"There is no single policy solution to solve the overall problem,\" CSIS authors wrote, \"Moreover, resolving any of the underlying issues does not guarantee a drastic improvement of the situation.\"\n\nIn its conclusion, the report suggests that continuous production of Navy vessels based on multi-year contracting would stabilize projects, budgets, and the workforce.\n\nAnother solution could involve more cooperation with US partners and allies, something Washington is already pursuing. South Korean shipyards, some of the most advanced and busiest in the world, are conducting more maintenance on US Navy vessels and major partnerships between these yards and the US are aimed at modernizing American shipbuilding processes and workflows.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Dec 27 (Reuters) - China passed a revised law that for the first time formally regulates unmanned aircraft, a move set to reshape the country's ​fast-growing drone and low-altitude economy sectors, according to state media on Saturday.\n\nThe Standing ‌Committee of the National People's Congress approved the changes under the Civil Aviation Law on December 27, adding provision ‌on airworthiness certification for drones that plugs a key regulatory gap.\n\nThe overhaul comes as China's low-altitude economy - a national strategic initiative focusing on commercial activities below 3,000 meters - is forecast to grow to more than 2 trillion yuan ($280 billion) by 2030, from a 1.5 trillion yuan ⁠in 2025, according to estimates from ‌the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Peking University and China's Civil Aviation Administration (CAAC).\n\nUnder the new rules, effective on July 1 next year, all entities ‍involved in the design, production, import, maintenance and operation of drones must obtain airworthiness certification.\n\nDrone manufacturers will be required to assign a unique product identification code to each unit, in accordance with relevant ​national regulations.\n\nChina has implemented \"interim regulations\" for unmanned aircraft starting from 2024, which stipulate that ‌civil unmanned aircraft must be registered under real names. The regulations also specify that micro, light, and small civil unmanned aircraft do not require airworthiness certification, while medium and large ones must apply to CAAC for airworthiness certification.\n\nAs China's drone market has rapidly expanded, oversight has lagged. In recent years, several cities have reported flight delays caused by illegal drone ⁠operations, prompting fines and other penalties.\n\nThe tighter requirements will ​affect manufacturers such as DJI, the world's largest ​consumer drone maker, and EHang, which produces passenger drones.\n\nDrone logistics have become an important driver of China's low-altitude economy, with 2.7 million packages containing everything ‍from hamburger lunches to ⁠life-saving medicine delivered throughout 2024, according to transport ministry data.\n\nE-commerce and food delivery leaders like JD.com and Meituan have long talked about investing in drone logistics to ⁠improve supply chain efficiency.\n\nJD Logistics has tested drone delivery networks in Jiangsu, Shaanxi, and Sichuan, and has said ‌drones can reduce shipping times for rural customers by up to 70%.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Sophie Yu, Casey HallEditing by Shri Navaratnam)",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Chinese companies developing reusable commercial rockets will have access to a fast lane for initial public offerings on the tech-heavy STAR market that ​exempts them from some financial requirements, the Shanghai Stock Exchange said on Friday.\n\nBeijing is seeking ‌to address a gap in its space capabilities compared to the United States, which is currently dominant in the ability to return, ‌recover, and reuse a rocket's first stage, or booster, after it is launched.\n\nThe new guidelines build upon previous regulations published in June that made it easier for pre-profit innovative companies to get listed on the STAR market.\n\nThe fast lane exempts Chinese rocket firms from profitability and minimum revenue thresholds and instead requires them to ⁠have met key technological milestones, including ‌one successful orbital launch using reusable rocket technology.\n\nCHINA AIMING TO BREAK US, SPACEX STRANGLEHOLD\n\nU.S. billionaire Elon Musk's aerospace giant SpaceX currently holds a near monopoly on this ‍technology, and its signature Falcon 9 is the only reusable rocket model that is regularly launched and used to put satellites into orbit.\n\nEarlier this month, China's leading private rocket firm LandSpace became the first domestic entity to carry out ​a full reusable rocket test with the launch of its new Zhuque-3 model, signalling its ambition to ‌catch up to SpaceX.\n\nWhile the launch failed to complete the crucial step of recovering the rocket's booster, a flurry of Chinese state-owned and private players are now rushing to test launch their own reusable rockets.\n\nLandSpace has already said it wants to demonstrate a successful rocket recovery in mid-2026, when Zhuque-3 will be launched for a second time. But it has said the capital-intensive nature of rocket development means it ⁠will need access to China's capital markets if it hopes ​to compete with SpaceX.\n\nThe Shanghai exchange's rules do not state ​that rocket firms must successfully recover a rocket, only that reusable rocket technology be used to put a satellite into orbit, something LandSpace already achieved with this month's launch.\n\nCompanies ‍that undertake national missions ⁠or participate in major state-led space projects will receive priority support, according to the new guidelines, which take effect immediately, underscoring the close alignment between commercial launch activity and China's broader strategic ⁠goals.\n\nChina has repeatedly described SpaceX's monopoly on low-Earth orbit satellites as a national security risk and is actively pushing its own ‌satellite constellations, which it hopes will number in the tens of thousands within the ‌next decades.",

    "fullText": "China announced sanctions against 20 US defense companies and 10 senior executives on Friday, citing US arms sales to Taiwan as its motive.\n\nIn a statement, China's foreign ministry said their assets within China, including movable and immovable properties, would be frozen and that domestic organizations and individuals would be prohibited from doing business with them.\n\nIndividuals named on the list would also be denied visas and entry to the country, the ministry added.\n\nThe sanctions list includes Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, Boeing's St. Louis branch, Epirus, and Anduril Industries founder Palmer Luckey.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the foreign ministry said: \"We stress once again that the Taiwan question is at the very core of China's core interests and the first red line that must not be crossed in China.\"\n\n\"Any company or individual who engages in arms sales to Taiwan will pay the price for the wrongdoing,\" they added.\n\nAnduril did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider sent outside normal US working hours.\n\nChina's sanctions follow the US announcement of a $11 billion military package for Taiwan last week.\n\nThe deal, which includes self-propelled Howitzers and HIMARS rocket launchers, still needs to be approved by Congress — but it drew a swift response from Beijing.\n\nLin Jian, a spokesperson for the foreign ministry, said in a statement at the time that China \"strongly deplores and firmly opposes\" the sales.\n\nChina regards Taiwan as a breakaway province that will one day come under Beijing's control, and Chinese President Xi Jinping has refused to rule out an invasion of the island. Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party views Taiwan as separate from China.\n\nUnder the Taiwan Relations Act, the US is obligated to assist Taiwan in defending itself.\n\nBeijing has ramped up pressure around the island in recent years, holding frequent military exercises in the surrounding skies and waters.\n\nA 2024 report by the Washington, D.C.-based think tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies suggested that China may be able to exert power over Taiwan without launching an invasion.\n\nThe report said China could impose a quarantine of the island using its coast guard.\n\n\"The purpose of a quarantine is not to completely seal Taiwan off from the world but to assert China's control over Taiwan by setting the terms for traffic in and out of the island,\" it argued.\n\n\"A key goal is to compel countries and companies to comply with China's terms.\"",
