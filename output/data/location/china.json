    "fullText": "Ever since Eileen Gu decided to compete under the flag of China, and not the United States where she was born, her citizenship has been the subject of scrutiny and controversy.\n\nBorn in San Francisco, she said her decision to switch allegiance back in 2019 had everything to do with “inspiring” children from the country of her mother at the Olympics in her home country. That would be the 2022 Beijing Games, where Gu won two golds and a silver for China in freestyle skiing.\n\nShe’s since become a millionaire many times over, mainly due to her online presence and endorsements, not her skiing. She was the fourth-highest earning female athlete in 2025, earning upwards of $23 million. According to Sportico, all but $20,000 of that $23 million came from endorsements.\n\nNow, she’s back in the Olympics, still competing for China and, reportedly, being paid handsomely to do so.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Gu and Zhu Yi, a fellow American-born figure skater who now competes for China, were paid a combined $6.6 million by the Beijing Municipal Sports Bureau in 2025 for “striving for excellent results in qualifying for the 2026 Milan Winter Olympics.” In all, the two were reportedly paid nearly $14 million over the past three years.\n\nThe payments were revealed when the Beijing Municipal Sports Bureau budget was posted online with the names of Gu and Zhu. Their names have since been scrubbed from the public report.\n\nGu already has a silver in slopestyle in Italy, while Zhu — born Beverly Zhu in Los Angeles — is not competing in the 2026 Games.\n\n\"Sometimes it feels like I'm carrying the weight of two countries on my shoulders,” Gu said after winning silver in slopestyle. “Just being able to ski through all of that, you know. To still show my best and still be so deeply in love with the sport.\n\n\"That's really what I care about and I'm so happy to represent that today.\"\n\nThe subject of Gu’s citizenship remains shrouded in mystery. China does not allow dual citizenship, meaning Gu ostensibly had to give up her U.S. passport.\n\nGu will compete in two more events — women’s halfpipe and big air.",

    "description": "When I studied abroad in college, I attended the school that just unseated Harvard as one of the best in the world: Zhejiang University in China",
    "fullText": "In the spring of 2013, I was a sophomore at Tufts University in Massachusetts, soon to declare a dual major in international relations and Mandarin Chinese.\n\nDespite my lofty aspirations to travel the world as a diplomat, my academic career so far had taken me a whopping 25 miles north of my hometown. That's why my university's study abroad program in China appealed to me.\n\nOnce I heard the tales of adventure from the 2012 program's freshly minted graduates, I eagerly applied. That summer, with an acceptance letter in hand, I set off to enroll at Zhejiang University.\n\nUpon landing in Shanghai, my American classmates and I were piled into a minibus for the two-hour drive south to the garden city of Hangzhou — capital of Zhejiang Province and home to Zhejiang University (affectionately referred to by locals as ZheDa).\n\nAfter settling into the dorm, which was a single room with a private bathroom, we were welcomed by our professors with a banquet at the college's canteen — an establishment which was far better than the standardized cafeteria fare that I'd come to know back in New England.\n\nIn our dormitory building, for the equivalent of $2 at the time, one could acquire a filling meal any time of the day — from rice porridge and steamed buns in the morning to stir-fried vegetables and sweet and sour pork tenderloin in the evening, all cooked fresh to order.\n\nZhejiang University was massive and spread across multiple campuses throughout the city. Fortunately for us newcomers, our group at the University's International College was tucked into a leafy hillside on the historic Yuquan campus, offering a slice of Chinese university life at an approachable scale.\n\nAs the sweltering days of summer transitioned into an osmanthus flower-scented autumn, I settled into a new school year. Each morning consisted of four hours of intensive language instruction, followed by at least a few more hours of homework and self-study in the afternoon.\n\nIn addition, each week we'd attend one three-hour lecture on Chinese Peasant History with our advisor, who drew heavily from his own experiences as an academic sent to the countryside during Mao's Cultural Revolution.\n\nI also had a three-hour lecture on the Chinese Legal System with a professor who'd argued many cases within China's rapidly evolving court system.\n\nWhile my application to enroll in Zhejiang University was relatively quick and painless, the road to admission for most of ZheDa's domestic student population was comparatively long and grueling.\n\nFrom an early age, they'd studied for hours at school, followed by hours at buxiban (cram schools), preparing to ace China's notoriously difficult standardized exams, such as the Gaokao. Of the millions who sit for the Gaokao each year, only the highest scorers earn spots in China's most prestigious schools, such as Peking, Tsinghua, and Zhejiang universities.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the academic work ethic that carried students to Zhejiang University did not fall off after admission. While most of my international classmates would study long hours during the week, we would take Friday nights and weekends off to travel within China. But many local students, however, rarely engaged in such frivolous pursuits and were more likely to be studying in the library on a Friday or Saturday evening.\n\nAs exams marked the end of my semester at ZheDa in December 2013, I personally experienced the exacting academic standards that my Chinese classmates were intimately familiar with. While I did pass all of my classes, a minor error in pronunciation or a stroke askew in a written character, mistakes that my Chinese professors back at Tufts may have overlooked, were marked down harshly by my professors at Zhejiang University.\n\nWhen scrolling Instagram in January 2025, I saw a familiar sight in a post from The New York Times — a statue of Mao Zedong standing before Laohe Hill and a familiar library, waving to the students on a verdant Yuquan Campus. Reading on, I was proud to learn that my study abroad alma mater had been named the most productive research university in the world by Leiden Rankings, outpacing even my hometown juggernaut, Harvard.\n\nI cannot say that I am shocked by this development. My semester at ZheDa showed me a culture of academic rigor on a scale few American universities can match, drawing from an academic talent pool far larger than in the US.\n\nMy time at ZheDa forced me out of my comfort zone and exposed me to an academic world significantly different from that in which I'd been educated, and I believe I am a more open-minded learner for it.",

    "fullText": "SAO PAULO, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Brazil's cattle slaughtering activity for the fourth quarter shows beef packers boosted processing by 13.1% ‌from the same period in 2024, according to preliminary Brazilian census bureau ‌data released on Thursday.\n\nThe tally, if confirmed, would take Brazil's total slaughtering to 42.3 million head ​in 2025, a record, as strong Chinese demand drove an acceleration of processing and put Brazil ahead of the United States as the world's biggest beef producer.\n\nBrazil's government trade data indicates Chinese demand remained strong in January, with $650 million worth ‌of beef shipments to the ⁠Asian nation last month, almost 45% more than a year ago.\n\nOverall, Brazil sold some 232,000 metric tonnes of fresh beef ⁠to multiple destinations in 2025, generating almost $1.3 billion in revenue. China's share of Brazil's beef trade was roughly half, by value and volume.\n\nGoing forward, however, Brazilian companies may ​not ​be selling as much to their top trade ​partner, as Beijing introduced maximum annual ‌import quotas for suppliers over three years. Anything exceeding a certain threshold will be levied a 55% tariff.\n\nChina's \"safeguard measures\" spooked local processors. But as Beijing is unwavering, the Brazilian government is now discussing with the industry a plan to assign specific quotas to companies, in the same proportion as their exports to ‌China last year, to regulate supplies.\n\nDefenders of ​the move argue it could avoid upward pressure ​on cattle prices, or a ​fall of beef export prices, as local companies rush to ‌export to China to fill their quota ​faster than others. ​Detractors say it may allow unprecedented meddling with food exports.\n\nBeijing will exempt 1.106 million metric tons of Brazilian beef from additional tariffs this year. ​On average, local exporters ‌would sell some 92,000 tons monthly to China under the threshold, ​which compares with nearly 140,000 tons monthly in 2025.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Feb 12 (Reuters) - China's chief trade negotiator Li Chenggang met Mexico's Deputy Economy Minister Vidal Llerenas in Beijing on Monday, in ‌the first face-to-face talks since Mexico imposed higher tariffs on Chinese imports, ‌drawing warnings from Beijing.\n\nThe two countries conducted in-depth exchanges on bilateral economic and trade relations and ​other issues, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nHow do USMCA negotiations affect Chinese investment plans?\n\nHow might China respond to Mexico's tariff increases?\n\nWhy did Mexico impose higher tariffs on China?\n\nWhat impact could tariffs have on China-Mexico trade?\n\nMexico announced in December steep tariff increases on China and other countries without free trade agreements with Mexico - most up to 35%. The move was widely interpreted by analysts as an attempt ‌to placate U.S. President Donald ⁠Trump, who levied significant tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nMexico's duties apply to thousands of goods including automobiles, auto parts, textiles, clothing, plastics and ⁠steel.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said the tariffs are intended to increase domestic production and address trade imbalances. The tariffs are expected to have the biggest impact on China, which ​is Mexico's ​second-largest trading partner after the United States.\n\nChina's ​Commerce Ministry had warned Mexico to \"think ‌twice\" before levying tariffs and said it would take steps in response to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests, but it has so far not announced countermeasures.\n\nSeparately, China's top automaker BYD said in 2024 it was considering setting up a factory in Mexico, although the FT reported in March that China was delaying approval for ‌the plant over concerns of technology leakage to ​the United States.\n\nThe China-Mexico talks come as the ​U.S., Mexico and Canada prepare to ​jointly review their free trade agreement by July 1.\n\nThe U.S.' top ‌trade negotiator has said the pact ​is not equipped to ​deal with surges of exports and investment from non-market economies such as China into the region, suggesting the U.S. may press for tighter rules on ​China-origin goods in a ‌new agreement. That would make it harder for Chinese firms to use ​Mexico as a base for exporting to the U.S.",

    "description": "Without more aircraft to hit Chinese defenses, the Air Force might have to hold back, risking the military getting drawn into a slog, experts said.",
    "fullText": "The US Air Force will need a lot more next-generation fighter jets and bombers to fight a war against China, former pilots and airpower experts argued in a new report.\n\nThey said the Air Force will need to procure significantly more of the new and coming B-21 Raider bombers and F-47 fighter jets than it currently plans to buy. Insufficient numbers may force the service to operate conservatively, potentially giving China an edge in such a fight, they warned in a Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies policy paper out this week.\n\nThe report said that China's anti-access and area-denial network, together with its natural geography, creates sanctuaries from which its air and missile defenses can fire. The firepower available to Chinese forces within these sanctuaries could pose a threat to US forces, making eliminating them critical to US operations.\n\n\"The Air Force's stealthy bombers and fighter inventories have the survivability needed to penetrate high-density threat areas but lack enough sortie capacity for a conflict with China,\" wrote report authors Heather Penney and retired Air Force colonel Mark Gunzinger.\n\nThe authors propose that the Air Force field at least 200 B-21s and 300 F-47s, which would be roughly double the service's current plans. The Air Force has said it will purchase at least 185 of the F-47s developed by Boeing and at least 100 of the B-21s produced by Northrop Grumman. The Mitchell Institute identifies Boeing and Lockheed Martin as supporters.\n\nThe authors additionally recommended boosting procurement of Lockheed's fifth-generation F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter and Boeing's advanced F-15EX Eagle II.\n\nIn an virtual event discussing the new report, Penney, a former F-16 pilot, said that past conflicts in Korea and Vietnam, as well as Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine, have shown that unless militaries take out enemy bases and sanctuaries, they could end up stuck in wars of attrition, the gradual bleeding of personnel and resources and little movement on the battlefield.\n\nIn a conflict with China, the US would likely face more advanced air defenses than it did in last year's Midnight Hammer operation against Iran or this year's Operation Absolute Resolve against Venezuela. Without a greater reserve of aircraft, Penney said, Air Force tactics for targeting Chinese sanctuaries would likely have to be less aggressive to avoid unnecessary risk to a limited fleet.\n\nThe B-21 is in low-rate initial production, though the only deliveries have been test, not operational, aircraft, while the contract for the design and development of the F-47 fighter jet was only awarded last year.\n\nNeither aircraft is expected to be operational in significant numbers for years. In the meantime, the Air Force is dependent on older, though still capable, bombers like the B-52 Stratofortress, B-1 Lancer, and B-2 Spirit.\n\nThe Mitchell Institute said budget increases of at least $40 billion a year could support higher procurement rates, as well as the acquisition of uncrewed Collaborative Combat Aircraft, or \"loyal wingmen\" drones, which Air Force officials have said won't replace crewed planes but instead complement them.\n\nMultiple assessments have found the Air Force's fleet is the smallest, oldest, and least combat-ready it has been in decades. By the numbers, today's inventory of fighters, bombers, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft is a fraction of its Cold War strength.\n\nAt the same time, experts have highlighted that the Air Force has been under increased strain due to constant conflicts and missions. A US Government Accountability Office report from 2024 said continuous deployments had reduced Air Force readiness, personnel, equipment, and aircraft. The government watchdog agency found that the service was pursuing fixes to these issues, but the demand on these forces was still higher than capacity.",

    "fullText": "LIMA, Peru (AP) — The Trump administration on Wednesday expressed concern that China was costing Peru its sovereignty in solidifying control over the South American nation's critical infrastructure, a blunt warning after a Peruvian court ruling restricted a local regulator's oversight of a Chinese-built mega port.\n\nThe $1.3 billion deepwater port in Chancay, north of Peru's capital of Lima, has become a symbol of China's foothold in Latin America and a lightning rod for tensions with Washington.\n\nThe U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said on social media that it was “concerned about latest reports that Peru could be powerless to oversee Chancay, one of its largest ports, which is under the jurisdiction of predatory Chinese owners.\"\n\nIt added: “We support Peru’s sovereign right to oversee critical infrastructure in its own territory. Let this be a cautionary tale for the region and the world: cheap Chinese money costs sovereignty.”\n\nThe concern comes as the Trump administration seeks to assert dominance over the Western Hemisphere, where China has long built influence through massive loans and high trade volumes.\n\nThe Chinese government on Thursday strongly rejected the U.S. comments.\n\n“China firmly opposes and strongly deplores the U.S.’s blatant rumor-mongering and smearing of Chancay port,” said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian at a daily briefing in Beijing.\n\nChancay, along the Pacific coast, is part of Beijing’s Belt and Road initiative, an infrastructure program that has seen Chinese state-owned banks offer sizable loans or financial guarantees to construct seaports, airports and highways, among other projects, across multiple continents.\n\nAs Latin America's deepest port, Chancay is capable of berthing some of the world’s largest cargo ships traveling between Asia and South America. China has been Peru’s biggest trading partner for more than a decade now.\n\nChina’s state-owned shipping and logistics company Cosco, a majority shareholder in the port, dismissed the U.S. claims.\n\nIn response to questions from The Associated Press, it said the court ruling “in no way involves aspects of sovereignty\" and insisted that the port remains \"under the jurisdiction, sovereignty and control of Peruvian authorities, subject to all Peruvian regulations.”\n\nIt added there were plenty of Peruvian authorities monitoring the port's activities, including police forces, environmental regulators and customs officials.\n\nThe ruling issued Jan. 29 by a lower court judge orders Peruvian authorities to refrain from exercising “powers of regulation, supervision, oversight and sanction” over the port in Chancay.\n\nThe regulator, Ositran, which has oversight over all of the country's other major ports, said it would appeal the decision, arguing that there was no reason to exempt Cosco Shipping from the agency's oversight.\n\n“(Cosco Shipping) would be the only company providing services to the public that could not be supervised,\" Verónica Zambrano, president of Ositran, told a local radio station Wednesday.\n\nAlthough it's privately owned, the Chancay Port covers 180 hectares (about 445 acres) of Peruvian territory, Zambrano added, making it subject to government efforts to monitor and enforce compliance with local user protection standards.",

    "title": "Here's what smart people are saying about China's push to cut holdings of US Treasury debt",
    "description": "China told its banks to reduce holdings of US government debt this week, with market pros split on how the move could impact the US and Treasury markets.",
    "fullText": "China instructed banks to dial back their holdings of US Treasury debt this week, a move that sparked fresh conversations about \"Sell America.\"\n\nChinese regulators said the move was related to volatility and concentration risks in US debt, and it wasn't framed specifically as a critique of the dollar-led financial system. Yet, market commentators see it, in part, as an update to a broader geopolitical narrative that's gripped markets in the last year.\n\nBloomberg reported that China's banks collectively hold $298 billion in US dollar-denominated bonds, though is not known much of that is made up of US Treasurys versus things like US corporate debt.\n\nThe impact on treasury yields has been minimal so far, but economists and market pros say the move raises concerns about future knock-on effects.\n\nA senior fellow at the economic policy think tank, Lachman has previously raised concerns about the position of the US as a global economic superpower.\n\nHe said this week that he is deeply concerned about what China's decision may mean for the US, particularly as other nations have already begun shifting away from dollar-denominated assets.\n\n\"[The US] desperately needs foreigners to keep buying US Treasuries to provide that financing, and the last thing that it needs is for foreigners to start selling their Treasurys,\" he told Business Insider, adding that foreign investors hold about 30% of the outstanding amount of US Treasurys.\n\n\"The drying up of foreign buying of our government's bonds could set us up for a bond market and dollar crisis.\"\n\nSetster isn't as concerned about the market implications of China's move. He sees the decision as a reflection of China's need to make changes in order to help stabilize its own economy and guard against volatility from the US after struggling in recent years.\n\n\"Global investors should consequently be paying much more attention to the flows tied to China's currency management,\" he advised. \"Despite the recent warning, my strong suspicion is that Chinese state institutions will struggle to find good alternatives to the Treasury market if they are buying $50 billion or \n\nKedia, an economist at the libertarian think tank, shares Setser's perspective that investors shouldn't regard China's decision as a geopolitical development. He told Business Insider that while he expects China to continue selling off its US Treasurys, it likely won't yield a sizable negative impact for the US.\n\n\"People have a way overestimated opinion of how much value of US government debt China actually holds,\" he stated. \"The value isn't anywhere near enough to crash our markets or anything like that.\"\n\nKedia acknowledged that a massive offloading of government bonds would likely impact the market, but he added that he doesn't see that as likely\n\nRen, who serves as director of modern alpha at asset manager WisdomTree, sees it as more explicitly geopolitical than other commentators.\n\n\"The move is largely geopolitical, with financial factors secondary,\" she said. \"China uses US treasury holdings for part of its currency management, making rapid liquidation unlikely. While near-term risks remain low, preparations for potential regional conflict involving Japan or the Taiwan Strait are reinforcing incentives on both sides to reduce financial dependence.\"\n\nIn her view, China isn't likely to be a net buyer of US government debt until the two nations reach an equilibrium.\n\nThe market research firm's chief China strategist thinks the regulatory guidance is mostly about risk management. That said, he thinks geopolitical tensions are a factor in China's decision as well.\n\n\"China has been reducing its holdings of US assets—particularly Treasurys—in recent years, and the pace has accelerated sharply since Russia's invasion of Ukraine,\" he said. \"Beijing's core strategic objective is to reduce its vulnerability to potential US sanctions under conditions of severe geopolitical stress.\"\n\nLike Kedia, Wang expects China to continue selling its holdings of US government debt. He claims that US Treasurys account for roughly 20% of China's reserves, likely above the comfort level of its government.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — In China, consumerism appears to outweigh nationalism regardless of how testy relations have become in recent diplomatic spats with countries like Japan and the United States.\n\nIt has been common practice for the ruling Communist Party to whip up nationalist sentiment and deploy propaganda condemning countries deemed to be violating China's stance on territorial issues as Taiwan and Tibet. At times, Beijing targets companies that make ideological missteps in their maps or advertising.\n\nIn the past, friction with Japan and the United States has led to calls for mass boycotts, protests in the streets or even vandalism on embassies or restaurants. These days, pure nationalism appears not to resonate so much with Chinese consumers accustomed to making their own personal consumption choices.\n\n“Chinese consumers, especially urban middle-class and younger demographics, are not making everyday purchasing decisions based on nationalism,” said Jacob Cooke, CEO of Beijing-based consultancy WPIC Marketing + Technologies.\n\nJapan still sells despite tensions\n\nBeijing reacted with outrage to Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's comment, not long after she took office in October, that an attack on Taiwan, the self-ruled island China claims as its territory, might require a military intervention by Tokyo.\n\nChinese officials have condemned the remark and moved to restrict some trade with Japan. Warnings to Chinese travelers not to visit Japan, an ultra-popular destination, have had a notable impact on its tourism industry.\n\nBe that as it may, huge crowds turned up to the opening of an outlet of Sushiro at a Shanghai mall in December.\n\nThe Japan-based conveyor-belt sushi chain has become a smash success since it opened its first branch in mainland China in 2021.\n\n“It tastes good,” said Edith Xiao, a 23-year-old university student who lined up outside a Sushiro restaurant in a Beijing mall for more than half an hour to get in. “The quality of the ingredients is guaranteed.”\n\nXiao is also a fan of the Japanese manga and anime series Chiikawa, whose cherubic, hamster-like cartoon character is popular among Chinese.\n\nThe broader state of China-Japan relations has had little impact on her own consumption of Japanese culture or restaurants, she said.\n\n“It’s just statements made by leaders. It doesn’t represent a change in the attitude of people of the country,” she explained.\n\nAmerican culture appeals to Chinese consumers\n\nTensions between the Chinese and U.S. governments over tariffs, Taiwan and other issues also don’t appear to be causing Chinese to punish American brands.\n\nDisney’s Zootopia 2 is a huge hit in China, where its fans, many in cosplay of its characters, helped make it one of the biggest global cinematic hits of 2025.\n\nIt became the highest grossing Hollywood film in China on record with more than 4.4 billion yuan ($634 million) in revenue, according to Chinese entertainment data provider Beacon Pro.\n\nDespite a government push to promote and subsidize homegrown movies to make China a “strong film power” by 2035, Chinese film-goers say they welcome an escape into foreign cinematics.\n\nZootopia 2 was a light-hearted option, said Ruan Wenlin, who watched the movie in Beijing. “It was so hilarious,” she said.\n\nMany Chinese consumers are “tired, exhausted and anxious from COVID and from the weak economy,” said Shaun Rein, managing director at China Market Research Group. “People are watching Hollywood movies, especially cartoons like Zootopia, because they’re stressed out and just want something to relax themselves,” he said.\n\nRalph Lauren, the New York-based fashion brand, meanwhile has been building on its “old money” and quiet luxury aesthetic to win favor with urban middle-class Chinese who are prioritizing quality and value over nationalism, analysts say.\n\nAmerican fashions appeal to many, despite often fraught relations between Beijing and Washington. Ralph Lauren’s sales have grown faster in China than in Europe or North America.\n\n“What attracts me most is its stable brand image and design,” said Zhang Tianyu, who was shopping recently at a Ralph Lauren outlet in Beijing.\n\nAmerican brands that are succeeding are doing so because they genuinely meet consumer needs or represent a lifestyle Chinese consumers want to associate with, not because of country-of-origin alone, said Cooke from WPIC Marketing + Technologies.\n\nEvolving patterns as ‘patriotic buying’ trend shifts\n\nAs a wave of patriotic buying of Chinese brands — dubbed “guochao,” or national tide in Chinese — has evolved and matured, many consumers have grown comfortable with both foreign and domestic brands.\n\n“Chinese (people) have stopped buying just for the sake of buying Chinese brands,\" said Rein from China Market Research Group. Consumers are “scared about the economy, they’re anxious about their job prospects. So they’ll just buy whatever brand, domestic, Chinese or foreign, fits their definition of value and lifestyle,” he said.\n\nCompared with a decade ago, nationalist sentiment has less influence on consumer behavior, analysts said.\n\nIn 2012, Chinese crowds gathered for anti-Japan protests over a territorial dispute, smashed Japanese brand cars and vandalized Japanese restaurants. There were calls to shun Japanese goods.\n\nLikewise in 2021, Western brands including Nike were hit with boycotts in China due to disputes over political issues such as Beijing's treatment of members of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, in the country's far west.\n\nMore recently, controversies like a Pokemon card game event that was originally planned to be held at a shrine to honor Japan’s war dead still triggered angry comments on Chinese social media, but no obvious broader repercussions.\n\n“We may believe that all Chinese consumers should follow Beijing’s direction of discarding foreign influence, which is misleading,” said Yaling Jiang, an independent Chinese consumer analyst. “Geopolitics does not dictate business flows on the local level.”\n\nShoppers often will just mix and match to suit their own tastes, Jiang said.\n\nThe ascent of strong Chinese brands has emerged as a key challenge for foreign companies. From electric vehicles to smart phones to athletic wear, local companies are fast gaining market share both at home and abroad.\n\n“Chinese will choose Chinese brands because they’re better, better value, better quality, better pricing,” said Rein.\n\nAfter the government declared that travelers should avoid trips to Japan, employees of state-owned companies and government agencies, as well as travel agencies, fell in line. Hundreds of flights operated by China’s major state-owned airlines, and Japan-bound group tours, were cancelled.\n\nThe number of Chinese visitors to Japan fell 45% in December from a year earlier, to about 330,400. Many Chinese are still traveling to Japan individually, despite earlier warnings from officials, often while keeping a low-profile on social media.\n\nAP’s Beijing newsroom contributed to this story.",

    "description": "Think GPS runs the world? China's BeiDou is a fast-rising rival with military and disaster uses, plus a rapidly expanding satellite and ground network.",
    "fullText": "The term \"GPS\" has become ubiquitous in American life. You know it as the foundational technology of navigation apps like Google Maps and Waze, but in most of the world, GPS is just a meaningless trio of letters. The Global Positioning System is owned and operated by the U.S. military, and it is just one of many Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in operation around the world. In the European Union, people find their way with help from a GNSS called Galileo. In Russia, they use GLONASS (GLObal NAvigation Satellite System). Japan has QZSS (Quasi-Zenith Satellite System), commonly known as Michibiki. But there's one system that matters more than people realize: China's BeiDou isn't just a GPS alternative, it's a fast-growing platform with uses that go far beyond navigation.\n\nThe first BeiDou satellites launched in 2000, and by 2020, it had achieved global coverage. Just like America's GPS, BeiDou is owned and operated by its home government, and the ruling Chinese Communist Party has kept most of its technological specifications secret. However, BeiDou has caught the attention of other governments, particularly the United States, due to its wide-ranging uses. BeiDou does a lot more than guide people on their way to work. Just as GPS is closely tied into the American military, BeiDou is becoming ingrained in China's military operations, used by guided missiles and bombs. It's also being used for monitoring and responding to natural disasters. BeiDou is already more advanced than GPS in many ways, and it's grown at a stunning pace.\n\nBeiDou is much younger than GPS, which first launched in 1978 and achieved full coverage in 1993. However, the Chinese government has pursued progress on its GNSS much more aggressively than the United States. BeiDou was born with a competitive spirit, as part of a push to bolster China's military wing, the People's Liberation Army, at the end of the last century.\n\nA defining moment for China's GNSS ambitions came amidst the 1996 Taiwan Strait missile crisis, when tensions between the Chinese and Taiwanese governments led to the PLA conducting a series of missile tests in the East China Sea. During one of the tests, the Chinese missiles missed their targets badly. They had been relying on a GPS signal that went out, and Chinese officials later suggested the signal had been disrupted. The CCP resolved at that moment to develop a GNSS independent of, and superior to, the Americans'. From the beginning, national defense, and particularly missile guidance, was at the forefront of BeiDou.\n\nSince the 2010s, BeiDou has played a major role in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a massive infrastructure project aimed at expanding trade routes across the Eastern Hemisphere. In the process, China has begun heavily promoting BeiDou on the international scale. Their partnership with the military of Pakistan in 2018 drew particular attention. Amidst a steady air of tension between Beijing and Washington, China's ability to fortify its allies' militaries will have immense geopolitical consequences in any form of conflict.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States has been steadily rolling out GPS III. It will be an upgrade over the currently available GPS system, but it will probably still fall short of BeiDou on most fronts. GPS III will add more satellites to the GPS constellation, but the new satellites are only an incremental upgrade over what's already in use. In fact, GPS III was originally intended to launch in 2014, so the system is already outdated in some ways — and the first satellites for its planned successor, GPS IIIF, aren't scheduled to launch until Spring 2027.\n\nBeiDou has raised alarms within the U.S. government amidst a tight competition with Beijing for tech superiority that has already shown the Chinese can outmatch our drone technology. Perhaps the most concerning comment about BeiDou came from within the U.S. government itself, in a memo from former Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen from 2023, which plainly said, \"GPS's capabilities are now substantially inferior to those of China's BeiDou.\"\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "description": "Family of Jimmy Lai, a Hong Kong media tycoon and vocal critic of China's Communist rule, calls his prison sentence cruel, and the \"end of justice.\"",
    "fullText": "Hong Kong — Jimmy Lai, the pro-democracy former Hong Kong media tycoon and a fierce critic of Beijing, was sentenced on Monday to 20 years in prison in the longest punishment given so far under a China-imposed national security law that has virtually silenced the city's dissent.\n\n Lai, 78, was convicted in December of conspiring with others to collude with foreign forces to endanger national security, and conspiracy to publish seditious articles. The maximum penalty for his conviction was life imprisonment.\n\n His co-defendants, six former employees of his Apple Daily newspaper and two activists, received prison terms of between 6 years and 3 months, and 10 years on collusion-related charges.\n\n Lai smiled and waved at his supporters when he arrived for the sentence. But before he left the courtroom, he looked serious, as some people in the public gallery cried. When asked about whether they would appeal, his lawyer Robert Pang said no comment.\n\n The democracy advocate's arrest and trial have raised concerns about the decline of press freedom in what was once an Asian bastion of media independence. The government insists the case has nothing to do with a free press, saying the defendants used news reporting as a pretext for years to commit acts that harmed China and Hong Kong.\n\n Lai was one of the first prominent figures to be arrested under the security law in 2020. Within a year, some of Apple Daily's senior journalists also were arrested and the newspaper shut down in June 2021.\n\nFamily warns Lai \"will die a martyr behind bars\"\n\nIn a statement, Lai's son, Sebastien, said the \"draconian\" prison term was devastating for his family and life-threatening for his father. \"It signifies the total destruction of the Hong Kong legal system and the end of justice,\" he said.\n\nHis sister Claire called the sentence \"heartbreakingly cruel\" in the same statement. \"If this sentence is carried out, he will die a martyr behind bars,\" she said.\n\nLai has been in custody for more than five years already.\n\nIn January, his lawyer Pang said Lai suffered health issues including heart palpitations, high blood pressure and diabetes.\n\nThe prosecution said a medical report noted Lai's general health condition remained stable. The government claimed Lai had requested to be held in solitary confinement.\n\nLai's sentence condemned around the world\n\nLai's sentencing could heighten Beijing's diplomatic tension with foreign governments, which have criticized Lai's conviction and sentencing.\n\n President Trump, who is expected to visit China in April, said in December that he felt \"so badly\" after the verdict was handed down, and he noted that he had spoken with Chinese leader Xi Jinping about Lai and asked him \"to consider his release.\"\n\nIn a statement shared by the State Department on Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the sentence \"an unjust and tragic conclusion to this case.\"\n\n\"It shows the world that Beijing will go to extraordinary lengths to silence those who advocate fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong,\" Rubio said, adding that \"after enduring a trial lasting two years, and detention in prison for more than five, Mr. Lai and his family have suffered enough. The United States urges the authorities to grant Mr. Lai humanitarian parole.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government also has called for the release of Lai, who is a British citizen. U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper called the prosecution \"politically motivated,\" saying the prison term is tantamount to a life sentence.\n\nHuman Rights Watch's Asia Director Elaine Pearson said the harsh 20-year-sentence is effectively a death sentence, calling it cruel and unjust.\n\nChinese leaders say Lai's sentence \"deeply gratifying\"\n\nHong Kong leader John Lee said Lai's sentence demonstrated the rule of law, calling the crimes he was convicted of \"heinous and evil in the extreme.\"\n\n The newspaper mogul's \"heavy sentence of 20 years' imprisonment demonstrates the rule of law, upholds justice and is deeply gratifying,\" Lee said in a statement.\n\nLin Jian, a spokesperson for China's foreign ministry in Beijing, said Lai was \"a key planner and participant in a series of anti-China and disruptive activities in Hong Kong,\" and lauded the sentencing as \"reasonable, legitimate, and legal,\" adding: \"There is no room for argument.\"\n\nLin urged \"relevant countries\" to respect the rule of law in Hong Kong.\n\nLai prosecuted under China's broad new security law\n\nLai founded Apple Daily, a now-defunct newspaper known for its critical reports against the governments in Hong Kong and Beijing. He was arrested in August 2020 under the security law that was used in a yearslong crackdown on many of Hong Kong's leading activists.\n\n In their ruling, three government-vetted judges wrote that the starting point of Lai's sentence was increased because they found him to be the mastermind of the conspiracies. But they also reduced his penalty because they accepted that Lai's age, health condition and solitary confinement would cause his prison life to be more burdensome than that of other inmates.\n\n \"Lai was no doubt the mastermind of all three conspiracies charged and therefore he warrants a heavier sentence,\" they said. \"As regards the others, it is difficult to distinguish their relative culpability.\"\n\n They took into account that Lai is serving a prison term of five years and nine months in a separate fraud case and ruled that 18 years of Lai's sentence in the security case should be served consecutively to that prison term.\n\nA chilling effect on China's journalists and academics\n\nUrania Chiu, lecturer in law at Oxford Brookes University, said the case is significant for its broad construction of seditious intent and application of the term \"collusion with foreign forces\" to certain activities by the media. The implication is particularly alarming for journalists and those working in academia, she said.\n\n \"Offering and publishing legitimate critiques of the state, which often involves engagement with international platforms and audiences, may now easily be construed as 'collusion,'\" Chiu said.\n\n The former Apple Daily staffers and activists involved in Lai's case entered guilty pleas, which helped reduce their sentences Monday. They earlier admitted to the prosecution charge that said they conspired with Lai to request foreign forces to impose sanctions or blockades, or engage in other hostile activities against Hong Kong or China.\n\n The convicted journalists are publisher Cheung Kim-hung, associate publisher Chan Pui-man, editor-in-chief Ryan Law, executive editor-in-chief Lam Man-chung, executive editor-in-chief responsible for English news Fung Wai-kong and editorial writer Yeung Ching-kee. They received prison terms ranging between six years and nine months, to 10 years.\n\n The two activists, Andy Li and Chan Tsz-wah, were sentenced to six years and three months, and seven years and three months respectively.\n\n The penalties for Cheung, Chan and Yeung, alongside the two activists, were reduced in part because they served as prosecution witnesses and the judges said their evidence had \"significantly\" contributed to the conviction of Lai.\n\n Before sunrise, dozens of people stood in line outside the court building to secure a seat in the courtroom. One of them was former Apple Daily employee Tammy Cheung.\n\n \"Whatever happens, it's an end — at least we'll know the outcome,\" Cheung said before the sentence was delivered.\n\n Lai founded Apple Daily in 1995, two years before the former British colony returned to Chinese rule. Its closure in 2021 shocked the local press scene. Hong Kong ranked 140th out of 180 territories in the press-freedom index compiled by media freedom organization Reporters Without Borders in 2025, far from its 18th place in 2002.\n\nOlympic skier Lindsey Vonn crashes seconds into race\n\nShock over Lindsey Vonn's Olympic crash; Trump calls Hunter Hess a loser for comments on politics\n\nMore details emerge on whistleblower complaint against Tulsi Gabbard",

    "description": "A report on Monday said regulators told banks in China to dial back Treasury holdings. Bond yields edged higher and the dollar dropped.",
    "fullText": "Regulators in China want banks to dial back their holdings of US Treasury bonds.\n\nThe move, reported by Bloomberg on Monday, is likely to fuel fresh talk about the \"sell America\" trade and the appeal of the dollar. Chinese authorities cited concentration risk and volatility in US debt markets as the reasons for scaling back.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Chinese banks have been urged to limit new purchases, while those with high exposure have been told to dial back their investments.\n\nTreasury yields, which move inversely to prices, were slightly higher on Monday morning. The dollar dropped more sharply, with the Dollar Index down almost 1% on the news. The fresh dip in the greenback follows its recent decline to four-year lows.\n\nWhile the report notes that the regulators framed the directive around financial stability, rather than geopolitical maneuvering, it's likely to spur more debate in the market about countries' willingness to keep lending to the US.\n\nThe \"sell America\" trade, in which investors dump dollar-denominated assets from stocks to Treasurys, was a focal point of markets last year. It's been fueled by a combination of fiscal concerns amid record-high US debt and deficit spending, as well as weaker trust in US institutions amid threats to central bank independence and ongoing tariff threats. It's also been a force behind the debasement trade, which has boosted gold and other metals in the last year.\n\nBloomberg added that regulators did not specify how much exposure they believe Chinese banks should have to US debt at this time.\n\nData from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange shows that as of September 2025, Chinese banks collectively held $298 billion in US dollar-denominated bonds, but it's not clear how much of that is US Treasury debt.\n\nDonald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke by phone last week, and could meet in Beijing in April.",

    "fullText": "LIVIGNO, Italy (AP) — Chloe Kim and Eileen Gu, two Olympic standouts who have faced their share of hate over the years, each weighed in Monday on Donald Trump's bashing of their friend, American freeskier Hunter Hess, for having said he didn't back the U.S. president's heightened crackdown on immigrants.\n\n“I think in moments like these, it is really important for us to unite and kind of stand up for one another for all that’s going on,\" said Kim, the two-time Olympic gold medalist whose parents are South Korean immigrants and who has faced racism throughout her career for her Asian heritage.\n\nGu, the American-born freeskier who competes for China, said after her silver-medal win in slopestyle that she had been in touch with Hess, who told her she was one of the few people who could relate to what he's going through.\n\n“As someone who’s been caught in the crossfire before, I feel sorry for the athletes,” said Gu, who was born in San Francisco and whose decision to compete for China turned her into a lightning rod.\n\nHess drew Trump’s ire when he was asked by reporters to give his views on the immigration crackdown that has claimed the lives of two protestors in Minnesota and disrupted thousands of lives of immigrants and U.S. citizens. Hess answered: “Just because I’m wearing the flag doesn’t mean I represent everything that’s going on in the U.S.”\n\nThe next day, Trump lashed out at Hess on his Truth Social account, calling him “a real Loser” and saying he would be hard pressed to root for him at the Games. Hess's friends — snowboarders and freeskiers competing this week in Livigno — were asked for their reaction.\n\n“My parents being immigrants from Korea, this one definitely hits pretty close to home,” said Kim, who begins defense of her title Wednesday.\n\n\"I’m really proud to represent the United States,” she said. “The U.S. has given my family and I so much opportunity, but I also think that we are allowed to voice our opinions of what’s going that we need to lead with love and compassion.”\n\nOther American snowboarders spoke out for diversity and the right of expression.\n\n“I think there are a lot of different opinions in the U.S. right now. Obviously we’re very divided,” snowboarder Bea Kim said. “I personally am very proud to represent the United States. That being said, I think diversity is what makes us a very strong country and what makes that so special.”\n\nTeammate Maddie Mastro added: “I’m also saddened with what’s happening at home.\"\n\n“It’s really tough and I feel like we can’t turn a blind eye to that. But at the same time, I represent a country that has the same values as mine of kindness and compassion. And we come together in times of injustice,” Mastro said.\n\nGu called it “an unwinnable press war” for Hess and lamented the fact that the controversy could be a distraction for the athletes, and overshadow the beauty of the biggest event in winter sports.\n\n“I’m sorry that the headline that is eclipsing the Olympics has to be something so ... unrelated to the spirit of the Games,\" she said. \"It really runs contrary to everything that the Olympics should be.”\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "He has been jailed, tracked and threatened by China’s government. What was it like pay a visit home? As he publishes a polemic about surveillance and state control, the artist relives a momentous trip to see his mother\n\nAi Weiwei is talking me through the decision-making process before his first visit to China in over a decade. The artist, known around the world as the most famous critic of the Chinese communist regime, had to do some fraught arithmetic before deciding to head back home.\n\nBefore boarding a flight with his son, who had never met the artist’s elderly mother, Ai thought back to his time in detention when his captors told him he would spend the next 13 years in custody on bogus charges: “They said, ‘When you come out, your son won’t recognise you.’ That was very heavy and really the only moment that touched me.”\n\nHe ended up spending several months in captivity. Lao, his son, is now 17. Ai says Lao doesn’t really need his guidance any more so he decided to book their flights and roll the dice. “People said, ‘Are you scared?’ I said, ‘No, why should I be scared?’ I’m Chinese. I have a Chinese passport. I’m entitled to go back and see my mum. So I went back.”\n\nWelcome to the life of Ai Weiwei. For most people, returning home doesn’t involve weighing up the risk of whether you’ll see close family ever again, but that’s the reality for a 68-year-old whose whole existence has been shaped by authoritarianism and the struggle against it.\n\nHis trip to China went well. He ended up being interviewed at the airport and released after a couple of hours into a country whose smells, sights and sounds were soothing to him. Ai described the journey as being like “a phone call suddenly reconnecting”. Today, he’s more poetic, describing it as “a piece of jade broken that you can put back together because it matches very well. Everything’s so familiar: the light, the temperature, the people.”\n\nAi is meeting me in the London offices of his publisher to talk about his new book, On Censorship, a 90-page polemic on the nature of state control, AI and surveillance. The man certainly knows about these things. Born in Beijing in 1957, he grew up in labour camps in north-west China following the exile of his father, the poet Ai Qing. In 2011, he was detained for 81 days in a 170 sq ft windowless prison because of his own activism. Upon his release, he was tracked, interrogated and threatened by the Chinese state; then his passport was returned in 2015 and he began a life in exile. He currently divides his time between Lisbon, Berlin and Cambridge.\n\nHis artworks are as dramatic as his backstory. An army of 1,600 Chinese artisans created 100m hand-painted porcelain “seeds” that were scattered over the floor of Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall in London 16 years ago. He cloaked Berlin’s Konzerthaus in 14,000 fluorescent orange lifejackets worn by refugees; and made a film dedicated to the children who died in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. That direct challenge to the official state narrative made him “the most dangerous person in China”.\n\nHis upcoming work, at Aviva Studios in Manchester, involves 30 tonnes of buttons, which were saved from a London factory that was closing down and smuggled into China to be turned into huge hanging artworks by craftspeople.\n\nThe book is a startling read, arguing that those in the west misunderstand the nature of censorship. He defines it as “the exercise of power over intellectual space”, both “an indispensable tool of mental enslavement and a fundamental source of political corruption”. It is not just authoritarian regimes, he warns. Liberal societies think that censorship is rare, “but people forget that even on sunny days, shadows are inevitable”.\n\nSome of the arguments are perplexing. In a section about the limitations of AI, the artist refers to the selfie he took with AfD leader Alice Weidel in 2018. He says AI decided that the image, which is real, must have been fake because the pair seemed to be on opposite ends of the political spectrum. At the time of the selfie, Weidel, whose grandfather was a Nazi, was considered to be in the more moderate wing of the far-right party, but since becoming leader has called for “large-scale repatriations” of foreigners, saying the country’s focus on the Holocaust is akin to a “guilt cult”.\n\nDoes Ai regret the selfie? He tells me that on many issues, her political demands “could be wrong”, but she’s still “more rational than other political opponents in Germany”. What about her anti-immigrant rhetoric – isn’t that anathema to him? “Some states don’t even accept one [immigrant] and Germany accepts 1.2 million, which is a pretty generous decision,” he replies. “So if they change the policy and they want to limit it, then there is nothing wrong.”\n\nHe’s also impressed by the fact that Weidel “openly wants Germany to be more independent from American influence”. He adds: “I think those are some of the things that we need to do.” Those who know German politics would find that argument surprising because the AfD are seen as the party who are closest to Trump and nearly all parties in the country want more independence from the US. A ringing endorsement of someone at the outermost reaches of far-right European politics might cause a few double takes, and there are more surprises.\n\nAi’s attitude to China has shifted dramatically. The nation, he said recently, is “in an upward phase,” pointing to the technological advancements made and increased personal freedoms. The west, however, struggles to “sustain its own logic”, has lost its “ethical authority” and has “descended into something barely recognisable”.\n\nAlthough a quick glance across the Atlantic at America in the age of ICE raids does somewhat make his point, he means Europe, too. So is the Chinese regime’s most famous critic now toeing the party line? “My position with China started before I could recognise myself as an individual. I grew up in this black hole with my father,” he says, pointing to a picture on his iPhone of a desolate location in north-west China.\n\nHe’s not angry exactly, but the suggestion that he’s softened on the Chinese government has touched a nerve. “I still have a Chinese passport. My mum is still Chinese. So that’s my only relationship to China,” he says. “I’m not nostalgic. I’m not patriotic.” What about the claim that the west embraces censorship? Is that his experience in the UK? “I cannot get into details,” he says cryptically. “But I feel the same kind of surveillance, same kind of censorship in the west.”\n\nPressed for an example, he tells me a story about the Royal Academy in London, an institution that gave him a landmark exhibition in 2015 and made him an honorary member in 2011 following his detainment in China. In November 2023, an exhibition of new works to be shown at the Lisson Gallery was pulled after he posted a tweet that began: “The sense of guilt around the persecution of the Jewish people has been, at times, transferred to offset the Arab world.” The tweet was deleted, with the artist telling journalists his show had “effectively [been] cancelled”.\n\nIn the aftermath, a vote was then held at the RA to determine whether his membership should be revoked because of accusations that the post was antisemitic. “I don’t have the intention of an antisemite. My best friends, they’re all Jewish people,” says Ai. “I tweeted millions of tweets on Twitter, but [how is it that] this tweet can cause such trouble? Then they said the procedure is to let the Academicians vote.”\n\nHis peers supported him and he won the vote. Ai was then asked to write an article about freedom of speech for the RA’s magazine, which he did, arguing: “Speaking the truth and insisting on one’s own perspective is dangerous and may come at a heavy price. Books may go unpublished, exhibitions may be closed, concerts cancelled.”\n\nAfter he sent it, there was silence. Then he says the RA claimed they didn’t have room to run the piece. For him, this is the censorship in the west, which he argues in On Censorship can be “more covert, more deceptive and more corrosive” than in authoritarian regimes. “I have several cases like this,” Ai adds. “Happens in Britain and in Germany.”\n\nThe RA disputes this account, claiming the decision to drop the piece was made before Ai submitted it. A spokesperson added: “Plurality of voices, tolerance and free thinking are at the core of what we stand for and seek to protect.”\n\nI wonder how Ai feels about the world in 2026. His new book paints it as a place without refuge for those who value self-expression and freedom of speech. “I think today we are living in a complicated world, where life is more like a shattered mirror,” he says. “It reflects the reality, but the reality can be a broken reality.”\n\nDid his trip to China restore his faith in humanity? There’s a pause. “If we were in the time of the Tang dynasty, someone like me would go back and write beautiful poetry,” he says, smiling. “But not today. I just take a few selfies.”",

    "fullText": "Men's downhill skiing tops the bill at the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics on Saturday, with the first medals to be handed out hours after the Games officially opened.\n\nThe opening ceremony culminated in the lighting of two cauldrons, one at Milan's Arch of Peace and one in Cortina d'Ampezzo, the chic resort 400 kilometres (250 miles) from Milan that is hosting the women's alpine skiing.\n\nAlberto Tomba and Deborah Compagnoni, two Italian skiing Olympic champions of the past, lit an intricate cauldron inspired by Leonardo da Vinci's knots at Milan's Arch of Peace.\n\nIn the freezing mountain air of Cortina, the duty was performed by Sofia Goggia -- an Italian former gold medallist who earlier Friday had taken part in a training run for the women's downhill event.\n\nA number of sports started before the opening ceremony -- curling, women's ice hockey, figure skating and snowboarding.\n\nBut all eyes will be trained on the blue riband alpine skiing event -- the downhill in Bormio, where the top men will do battle.\n\n-- Swiss racer Marco Odermatt is the favourite to win the men's Olympic downhill but will face a fierce challenge from his teammate and reigning world champion Franjo von Allmen.\n\nIn-form Italian Giovanni Franzoni and his veteran compatriot Dominik Paris will also likely be in the mix.\n\nOdermatt is bidding to become the fifth Swiss skier to win the men's downhill since it was first raced in 1948.\n\n-- China's freestyle skiing superstar Eileen Gu launches her bid for triple Olympic gold in Livigno in the slopestyle qualifying competition but will face stiff competition from defending champion Mathilde Gremaud, who is also a double world champion.\n\nThe US-born Gu, 22, was one of the faces of the 2022 Games in Beijing, winning the women's half-pipe and big air competitions and taking silver behind Switzerland's Gremaud in slopestyle.\n\n-- China's Su Yiming defends his Olympic big air crown in the first snowboarding final at the Milan-Cortina Games but must fight off a strong Japanese contingent.\n\nSu, 21, messed up his first run in qualifying in Livigno on Thursday but recovered strongly to finish fourth out of 30 competitors as Japan's Hiroto Ogiwara topped the leaderboard, with Italy's Ian Matteoli in second place and Japan's Kira Kimura in third.\n\n-- US star Ilia Malinin takes to the ice to continue his nation's bid to retain the figure skating team event title when he performs in the men's singles short programme section.\n\nThe Americans are leading after the first day of action thanks to a strong performance from world champion ice dancers Madison Chock and Evan Bates. They compete in the free dance on Saturday.\n\nJapan are second and pushing hard after Kaori Sakamoto triumphed in the women's singles short programme.\n\nThe team competition concludes on Sunday after the free skating finals.",

    "description": "The US accused China of secret nuclear tests, banned under international agreement, that were building toward tests of larger nuclear warheads.",
    "fullText": "The US accused China of secret nuclear explosive testing and attempting to cover it up, an official said Friday.\n\nBanned for decades under an international agreement to which China and the US are signatories, nuclear explosive testing involves the detonation of warheads. The US accusation comes on the heels of the expiration of the nuclear arms control New START agreement between the US and Russia, which limited their numbers of deployed warheads and launchers.\n\n\"I can reveal that the US government is aware that China has conducted nuclear explosive tests, including preparing for tests with designated yields in the hundreds of tons,\" US Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Thomas DiNanno said in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nDiNanno added that Beijing had used \"decoupling — a method to decrease the effectiveness of seismic monitoring — to hide its activities from the world,\" and said one such test had occurred on June 22, 2020. Decoupling refers to muffling the seismic signal of an underground nuclear test.\n\nA spokesperson for China's embassy in the US told Business Insider that Beijing is \"committed to peaceful development, follows a policy of 'no first use' of nuclear weapons, and a nuclear strategy that focuses on self-defense and adheres to its nuclear testing moratorium.\" The spokesperson added China is ready to work with other countries to uphold the agreement.\n\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, adopted in 1996, banned the live tests that have occurred for decades and contributed to nuclear scares and radioactive exposure. The last such test conducted by the US was in 1992, and China's most recent occurred in 1996. The only publicly known explosive testing this century has been by North Korea. The US, Russia, and China have signed the treaty but haven't ratified it, unlike nearly 180 other countries.\n\nCurrent testing practices rely on modeling, simulation, and subcritical testing, which officials have said are vigorous and dependable. Last year, US President Donald Trump raised concerns with vague comments on resuming nuclear testing in response to other countries.\n\n\"They seem to all be nuclear testing. We have more nuclear weapons than anybody. We don't do testing, and we've halted it years, many years ago. But with others doing testing, I think it's appropriate that we do also,\" the president said.\n\nThere's been some suspicion that US rivals have been preparing for testing, including work spotted at the Lop Nur and Novaya Zemlya nuclear sites in China and Russia, respectively.\n\nBut in response to DiNanno's comments, Robert Floyd, executive secretary of the CTBTO, said the organization's monitoring system \"did not detect any event consistent with the characteristics of a nuclear weapon test explosion at that time. Subsequent, more detailed analyses has not altered that determination.\"\n\nJust a day before DiNanno's comments, the New START agreement binding the US and Russia to a number of operational nuclear weapons and launchers, as well as a verification process and open communication, expired. Whether Washington and Beijing will continue to observe the treaty or attempt a new agreement remains unclear.\n\nThe Trump administration has said a new nuclear arms deal would need to account for the growth of China's nuclear weapons stockpile, which the Pentagon has assessed will top 1,000 by 2030. \"And as we sit here today, China's entire nuclear arsenal has no limits, no transparency, no declarations, and no controls,\" DiNanno said, adding that a post-New START treaty will address both Russia's vast arsenal and China's nuclear rise.",

That could compound challenges for AI companies as well as many other manufacturers.\n\nIn China, which accounts for more than 20% of Intel's overall revenue, its fourth- and fifth-generation Xeon CPUs are in particularly short supply, ⁠with Intel rationing deliveries, two of the people ‌said.\n\nIntel has a substantial backlog of unfulfilled orders for these models, with delivery times extending as long as six months, they added.\n\nAMD has also informed clients of supply constraints, said one of the people and a ‍third source. Delivery lead times for some AMD products have been pushed out to eight to 10 weeks, the third source said.\n\nThe extent of the supply contraints in China is being reported by Reuters for the first time.\n\nIntel, which flagged CPU supply constraints in its earnings call in January, said in a ​statement to Reuters that the rapid adoption of AI had led to strong demand for \"traditional compute\".\n\nThe company expects \"inventory at lowest level in ‌Q1, but we are addressing aggressively and expect supply improvement in Q2 through 2026,\" the statement said.\n\nAMD reiterated remarks in its earnings call that it has boosted its supply capabilities to cope with strong demand.\n\n\"We remain confident in our ability to meet customer demand globally based on our strong supplier agreements and supply chain, including our partnership with TSMC,\" it said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nThe two companies together dominate the global server CPU market. Intel has seen its market share decline from over 90% in 2019 to about ⁠60% in 2025, while AMD's share has climbed from around 5% in 2019 ​to more than 20% last year, according to a UBS report in January.",

    "description": "Device small enough to be mounted on trucks, aircraft, or even satellites",
    "fullText": "Chinese scientists have developed a compact ultra-powerful energy generator, paving the way for next-generation weapons that could one day be turned on satellite swarms like SpaceX’s Starlink constellation.\n\nHigh-power microwave weapons have gained traction in recent years as a low-cost alternative to missiles and guns due to their near-unlimited firing capacity.\n\nResearchers in the US, Russia, and China in particular have all been investigating whether the technology could be developed into directed-energy weapons that can disrupt satellites.\n\nDestroying a satellite in space is a messy business, with conventional weapons likely to create large amounts of orbiting debris that can have unpredictable consequences, including for a nation’s own satellites.\n\nIn theory at least, microwave weapons could disable a satellite with the creation of minimal debris and allow for plausible deniability, making them strategically advantageous.\n\nThese weapons operate by storing electrical energy and releasing it all at once in a powerful pulse – similar to a Tesla coil.\n\nThe massive power spike they are capable of producing can run microwave generators, which in turn can be used to disrupt electronics.\n\nUntil now most prototypes for these pulse generators have been large, measuring at least 10 metres long and weighing over 10 tons, making them difficult to install in smaller weapons systems.\n\nIn a new study, Chinese scientists from the Northwest Institute of Nuclear Technology (NINT) used a special liquid insulating material, dubbed “Midel 7131”, to achieve higher energy storage density, stronger insulation, and reduced energy loss, helping create an overall much more efficient and smaller device.\n\n“By adopting a high-energy-density liquid dielectric Midel 7131 and a dual-width pulse-forming line, the study achieved miniaturisation of an integrated Tesla transformer and pulse-forming system,” scientists wrote in the study published in the journal High Power Laser and Particle Beams.\n\nMeasuring just four metres (13 feet) long and weighing only five tons, the new device is the world’s first compact driver for a high-power microwave (HPM) weapon.\n\nDesignated TPG1000Cs, it is small enough to be mounted on trucks, aircraft, and even other satellites, researchers say.\n\n“The system has demonstrated stable operation over continuous one-minute durations, accumulating approximately 200,000 pulses with consistent performance,” researchers wrote.\n\nExperts say a ground-based microwave weapon with an output over 1 gigawatt (GW) could severely disrupt Starlink satellites in orbit.\n\nTPG1000Cs can achieve extremely powerful electrical pulses reaching 20 GWs, researchers said, according to SCMP.\n\nChina has published a number of studies stating the need to find ways to disrupt Elon Musk’s Starlink satellites.\n\n\"The potential military application value of the Starlink megaconstellation has been highlighted in the Russia-Ukraine conflict,\" Chinese researchers from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics wrote in a study earlier this year.\n\n\"In recent years, the militarisation of space has intensified, posing a significant threat to China's space security. It is particularly important to track and monitor its operational status,\" they wrote in the research published in the journal Systems Engineering and Electronics.\n\nLast year, scientists from Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), which consistently contributes to China’s defence research, simulated a way to disrupt Starlink satellites spread over an area the size of Taiwan.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Feb 6 (Reuters) - China used this week's Singapore Airshow to flex its military and aviation muscle, drawing heavy attention from regional delegations as Beijing sharpens its bid for influence in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe U.S. military has demonstrated its power this year through the precision extraction of ​Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and a major naval buildup around Iran. Yet President Donald Trump has been vocal in his criticism of some of U.S. ‌allies and imposed tariffs on them, creating an opening for China.\n\nWhile China's fighter jets and commercial airliners remain far from achieving mass-market international adoption, their makers appeared more assertive and confident and enjoyed greater ‌visibility this year at Asia's largest air show.\n\nThe PLA Air Force's aerobatic team made a headline-grabbing show debut of its Chengdu J-10C fighter jets, an aircraft whose export variant, the J-10CE, surged to prominence in 2025 when customer Pakistan used it to shoot down an Indian Air Force French Rafale.\n\nChinese state media reported the team had used mid-air refuelling to fly directly to Singapore for the high-profile deployment.\n\n\"That's a bit of a message to say: Our power projection is growing,\" said Tim Robinson, editor-in-chief of the Royal ⁠Aeronautical Society's Aerospace magazine.\n\n\"It's one of the key enablers ‌a modern air force should have. Previously people said this is one of their weaknesses.\"\n\nInside the sweltering air show's air-conditioned halls, Chinese state companies occupied a prime spot with brightly lit displays dominated by a 1:2 scale model of AVIC's J-35A stealth multirole ‍fighter. Little is known about the latest addition to Chinese air power, which was first seen domestically in 2024.\n\nNo technical data was displayed, but observers of the global arms marketplace said the message to Asia's buyers was evident.\n\n\"That's obviously positioned to say: if you can't afford an F-35 or are banned from buying an F-35 we've got an alternative,\" Robinson said.\n\nSoutheast Asian defence officials crowded Chinese military and aerospace booths, underscoring Beijing’s growing pull as it aggressively markets hardware across the region.\n\nThe show of strength ‌landed at a politically sensitive moment, with Southeast Asian governments increasingly uneasy about U.S. security commitments amid a more isolationist Washington under Trump, analysts and Western officials said.\n\n\"We see the same delegations as before but the conversation has changed,\" said a senior official at a Western arms company.\n\nIndustry-watchers are cautious about any sudden switch of arms trade but agree the backdrop reflects the new power politics and the diversification of supply chains.\n\n\"The Chinese arms companies may think that, if other countries have lost confidence in buying American, there's an opportunity for China,\" said China defence specialist Bradley Perrett.\n\n\"But most of the U.S.' customers, if they want to look elsewhere, will look ⁠at European, South Korean and Japanese equipment.\"\n\nAsia's arms spending is growing apace as countries respond ​to a sustained build-up from an increasingly assertive China.\n\nChina's efforts to penetrate the airliner ​market, grabbing share from Airbus and Boeing, are proceeding slowly due in part to the lengthy process of winning European certification.\n\nBut state-owned planemaker COMAC again flew the C919 narrowbody jet and advertised the future C929 wide-body in model form at the show. That is now ‍progressing through detailed design as a Chinese ⁠project after initially exploring a joint development with Russia.\n\nChinese delegates said that given the Singapore venue, COMAC was prioritising potential clients from Southeast Asia, and Indonesian attendees were among those inquiring about aircraft.\n\nChina's efforts to rival Airbus and Boeing are a national priority though Western analysts say it will take ⁠years if not decades to establish the global footprint and marketing support that helps the industry leaders maintain entrenched positions.\n\nBut delegates noted a broadening commercial assault at the show including the market ‌for alternative third-party spare parts, tapping into airline concerns about shortages at a time when supplies are strained across the globe.",

    "description": "OpenClaw is gaining ground in China as major tech firms add support and users flock to the viral AI agent.",
    "fullText": "The viral AI agent OpenClaw — formerly known as Clawdbot, then Moltbot — has found an audience in China.\n\nSince last week, Chinese tech companies including Tencent, Alibaba, and Volcano Engine, a cloud service platform under ByteDance, have begun integrating OpenClaw into their platforms, making it easier for Chinese users to run the agent. That includes connecting the agent to workplace tools such as Alibaba's collaboration platform, DingTalk, and Tencent Holdings' WeCom, the work version of China's super app, WeChat.\n\nOpenClaw began circulating widely in tech circles last month, attracting high-profile fans including Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan and multiple partners at Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nThe agent has also taken off among Chinese users, with demos, tutorials, and use cases spreading rapidly across local social platforms.\n\nOpenClaw is designed to run around the clock and plug into a wide range of consumer apps, allowing users to automate tasks such as managing schedules, overseeing vibe-coding sessions, or even building AI employees.\n\nIn a post on Tencent Cloud's developer platform, the company said last Thursday that its servers have rolled out a preconfigured OpenClaw application template, enabling users to deploy the AI assistant in the cloud with minimal setup.\n\nAlibaba Cloud has also rolled out support for OpenClaw on its platforms and said the agent can connect to a range of models from Alibaba's Qwen series.\n\nVolcano Engine, ByteDance's cloud services arm, outlined how developers can deploy Moltbot in its environment in an article published on Monday, while also flagging key safety considerations.\n\n\"Because the tool has extensive data, account, and network access permissions, please deploy it in a dedicated environment, avoid handling sensitive information, and be sure to review permissions regularly and set access restrictions for ECS and API keys,\" the article said, referring to cloud servers and access credentials.\n\nFor OpenClaw to run as a digital assistant across apps, it requires access to users' files, login details, browser activity, and other data.\n\nCybersecurity specialists told Business Insider in a report published on Wednesday that agents like OpenClaw can be vulnerable to \"prompt injections,\" a tactic that uses hidden instructions to trick AI into performing actions such as leaking data or publishing content on users' behalf.\n\nDespite mounting privacy and security concerns, enthusiasm for the agent among Chinese users shows little sign of slowing.\n\nPosts and demos featuring OpenClaw have surged on the Chinese social media platform RedNote.\n\nOne RedNote user who goes by \"Brother C\" posted a video tutorial last Tuesday, walking viewers through how to use OpenClaw. \"See how the 24/7 proactive AI assistant is revolutionizing workflows,\" he wrote. The post drew more than 4,000 likes and was saved over 6,000 times.\n\nAnother user posting under the nickname \"Teacher Du\" shared his own explainer on Monday, describing how OpenClaw could be deployed in everyday workflows. His post was saved more than 2,000 times and received over 1,000 likes.\n\n\"My experience was truly mind-blowing,\" he wrote, adding that the agent could handle \"all sorts of tasks\" and that the \"concept of a true AI employee is getting closer.\"\n\nLike their counterparts in the US, Chinese users are buying Mac Minis to run the agent. A RedNote user named Wu Bin said he had ordered a secondhand Mac Mini to serve as his \"super assistant.\"\n\n\"It's incredibly convenient, I can control it remotely to organize files and handle all sorts of tasks,\" he wrote.\n\nNot everyone is convinced. A user who goes by \"Programmer Yago\" warned in a RedNote post on Sunday that using the agent could leave users' data \"running naked all over the internet.\"\n\nOpenClaw did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Known as ‘white gold’, lithium is among the most important mined elements on the planet – ideal for the rechargeable batteries used in tech products. Can Europe’s largest deposit bring prosperity to the local community?\n\nIt looks more like the past than the future. A vast chasm scooped out of a scarred landscape, this is a Cornwall the summer holidaymakers don’t see: a former china clay pit near St Austell called Trelavour. I’m standing at the edge of the pit looking down with the man who says his plans for it will help the UK’s transition to renewable energy and bring back year-round jobs and prosperity to a part of the country that badly needs both. “And if I manage to make some money in the process, fantastic,” he says. “Though that is not what it’s about.”\n\nWe’ll return to him shortly. But first to the past, when this story begins, about 275-280m years ago. “There was a continental collision at the time,” Frances Wall, professor of applied mineralogy at the Camborne School of Mines at the University of Exeter, explained to me before my visit. This collision caused the bottom of the Earth’s crust to melt, with the molten material rising higher in the crust and forming granite. “There are lots of different types of granite that intrude at different times, more than 10m years or so,” she says. “The rock is made of minerals and, if you’ve got the right composition in the original material and the right conditions, then within those minerals there are some called mica. Some of those micas contain lithium.”\n\nThat’s what we are talking about here: lithium, the L-word. Or possibly the El Dorado word; lithium is often referred to as “white gold”, and in 2021 the then PM Boris Johnson declared that Cornwall would be the “Klondike of lithium”.\n\nIt is not breaking news that there is lithium here. Victorian miners reported finding it in the water coming from the ground. (You may know, possibly from Poldark, about Cornwall’s rich history mining tin and copper; it has been going on since the early bronze age, in about 2000BC.) Back then there was little use for lithium. Now it is a very different story. Its high electrochemical potential means lithium can hold a charge for longer than most other elements and so is ideal for use in rechargeable batteries. That’s phones, laptops and so much of the technology we use. Plus, electric cars and big battery storage projects. Lithium is now among the most important mined elements on the planet.\n\nMost of the world’s lithium is extracted in Australia and the lithium triangle in South America (Chile, Argentina and Bolivia), as well as in China, which also processes and therefore controls a majority of it for use in batteries. Cornwall doesn’t compare in scale, but it is, says Wall, “probably the largest lithium deposit in Europe”. A couple of companies – British Lithium and Cornish Lithium – are leading the way to tap into it.\n\nJeremy Wrathall is the founder of the latter. When he graduated from Camborne School of Mines in 1988, mining in Cornwall was gasping its last breaths – with just four active mines left, down from more than 300 in the 1860s. Now there are none, though there are still some china clay (kaolin) operations. So Wrathall went to work in South African goldmines, before returning to London to work as a mining analyst and financier.\n\nCornwall remained in his heart, though, and when electric cars began to be a thing, he remembered hearing about the lithium there. “I put lithium plus Cornwall into Google and up came four historical records of lithium being found in water. I thought: that one is an awful long way away from that one, they must be geologically connected. And then I thought: maybe I’m on to something and should start picking up mineral rights. So that’s what I did.”\n\nAlong with the mineral rights for which he did deals, Wrathall acquired a number of 19th-century mining plans, which gave him information about geological features – the granite and what was in it. He founded Cornish Lithium in 2016.\n\nWrathall says the UK – particularly Cornwall – will be able to extract 50,000 tonnes of lithium (actually lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate equivalent, depending on how it’s extracted) a year for more than 20 years – about 50% of the UK’s annual needs by 2030. There are two methods. One is to extract lithium from water via deep boreholes, which we will get to later. Here at Trelavour is the company’s “hard rock extraction” site. Wrathall picks up a small piece of rock. “You can see the sparkly bits, that’s the mica – all of this rock, everything you can see, has lithium.”\n\nHe explains that there will be some blasting, then the granite will be dug from the quarry and crushed before going on a conveyor belt to the processing plant in the valley. But, hang on; this doesn’t sound super sustainable, even if the intended destination is the UK’s transition to clean renewable energy. Lithium mining projects in Portugal and Serbia have been hampered by fierce opposition from locals and environmentalists. In Argentina, mining companies and politicians have been accused of robbing Indigenous people of their water and employing colonial-style divide-and-rule tactics in pursuit of the valuable metal. Why is that not happening here?\n\nWall explains that it is a very different process in South America, where brine gets pumped into a series of ponds and then evaporates slowly in the sun. Cornwall has neither the geology nor climate for that. Trelavour is a traditional quarry, “so you’ve got all your normal stuff associated with quarrying: drilling, blasting and lorries.” Environmental permits are very strict, she says, and they’ll need to sort out what they’re doing with the waste. “But the granite is pretty benign, it’s not like some of the sulphides, where you have a lot of trouble with acid mine drainage [the outflow of acidic water largely from metal and coal mines].”\n\nSome of the byproducts could be valuable: silica for cement, sulphate of potash for fertiliser, gypsum for plasterboard. Wrathall says the company’s crushers are electric and it will look into using electric trucks. “We’re trying our best to go zero carbon, or very low carbon.” The situation in Cornwall is different from the controversial projects in Europe, he says, because the quarry already exists; they will simply be repurposing it. “You can see the damage is done. In Portugal, it is a pristine area, olive groves, it would be digging up people’s farms. This is not a farm. What are you going to do with this? It’s dangerous, fenced-off to stop people getting in. And at the end of it, we will rehabilitate it.”\n\nI have found it hard to find anyone who is really against the project. Charmian Larke of the Cornwall Climate Action Network says: “Because the area is so destroyed anyway, the surrounding villages tend to be very poor, with poor health and educational outcomes.” Wrathall says the Cornish people are proud of their 4,000-year history of mining, “and it will bring back economic prosperity to an area with one of the highest levels of deprivation in the country”.\n\nOn cue, we are joined by Peter Morse, general manager of the hard-rock project here. He grew up in the nearby village of Roche. His family has been here for generations, he says, mostly working in the china clay industry, and he used to ride around in a truck with his grandad, driving in and out of the plants. He thought he would go into it, too, and did a geology degree. Instead, he went to the US, where he worked in the mining industry for 30 years.\n\nWrathall and Morse are what are known as “Cousin Jacks” – Cornish miners who went abroad to work. “If you go anywhere in the world and there’s a hole, there’ll be a Cousin Jack at the bottom of it,” says Morse. They took a bit of Cornwall with them: he says he could get a pasty on the shores of Lake Superior.\n\nWhen he came back home, it was different from when he left: fewer people were employed in the china clay business. St Dennis, the village nearest to the site, used to have three pubs and a bunch of shops. Now there is just one of each. “And St Austell is not the town it was when I went to school there. It was bustling, lively – but it doesn’t feel like that now.”\n\nMorse says lithium can help to reverse the trend. Cousin Jack is back. I also spoke to Noah Law, another local, now Labour MP for St Austell and Newquay. “Mining is part of our heritage, it’s part of what makes Cornwall great. It has made us wealthy in the past and can do the same again.”\n\nThings have changed though. “Mining is more capital intensive than it used to be, and not as labour intensive. Part of the challenge is sharing the prosperity. I’ve levelled with the industry to say we’re really invested in this and are going to work hard to make a success of the industry, if it is willing to work really hard to make sure my constituents are sharing the spoils.”\n\nLaw says Cornwall can be a beautiful place and an industrial powerhouse, “because that’s what we have been for the most of the past 200-300 years. It’s only recently that Cornwall hasn’t been an industrial economy.”\n\nCornish Lithium employs just over 100 people, and the plan is to triple that. “Every mining job provides at least four times as many knock-on jobs,” says Wrathall. And not just another shop selling wetsuits or ice cream. “They’re good, but that’s not going to make any difference to the lives of people here. What is going to make a difference is the development of an industry that is already here, but is now seeing its next generation. It’s going to change Cornwall’s future.”\n\nWe have come down from the quarry to the processing plant, where the lithium gets extracted from the granite. At this stage it’s a demonstration facility, but it still takes up a huge shed, a remnant of a former china clay facility. The crushed granite comes in at one end and the lithium is extracted in a series of processes. First physical – milling, soaking, spinning – followed by chemical separation that involves dissolving the mica in sulphuric acid. All the machinery – mills and pipes, scrubbers and chillers, pumps and vats – looks rather Willy Wonka. And here’s a bag of the end product – lithium hydroxide, a white crystalline power that looks, frankly, illegal.\n\nAbout 20 miles away, the villages of St Day and Gwennap were once big centres for tin and copper mining and the surrounding landscape is dotted with derelict brick engine houses from that time. Between the two is now the centre for Cornish Lithium’s other project: geothermal extraction. It doesn’t look much, a capped borehole in the corner of the United Downs industrial estate, but under the cap a shaft goes down 800 metres. This was the first exploratory hole. They’ve since done others, including one 2km deep on a farm a few miles away at Cross Lanes. The results were very positive and Cross Lanes has recently been granted planning permission for the country’s first commercial geothermal lithium production facility.\n\nIn another shed, Adam Matthews, who leads the geology team, shows me what it’s all about. Laid out on trays are hundreds of core samples of rock from the Cross Lanes drill holes: they look like pencil leads for giants. One is solid, “siltstone and sandstones mostly, the darker bands are muds, nothing of much interest”, says Matthews. But here’s one from 1,700 metres down, “and you can see fractures running throughout the rock. The water flows naturally throughout those fractures.”\n\nIn this water – hot brine – they have found lithium. The next stage is to drill two new larger diameter 2km-deep holes, one to pump the water out, the other to return it once the lithium has been extracted. It’s probably the least impactful, most sustainable way of getting hold of lithium.\n\nThe water at that depth is between 80 and 90C and Wrathall says it could be used to provide low-carbon heat energy for communities and industries. There are few houses to heat near to Cross Lanes, but he says the heat could be used in agriculture. “There is an opportunity to build greenhouses there, to grow tomatoes and cucumbers.”\n\nIt sounds wonderful – pumping water out of the ground, extracting the mineral that will help the country on its transition to renewable energy, then returning the water to where it came from … with a byproduct of locally grown salad.\n\nBut we’re not quite there yet. The next phase will be to build a demonstration plant to produce samples of lithium. If successful, the company will build a commercial production plant there. The Trelavour hard rock site is also still at the demonstration phase. Wrathall thinks they will first be producing lithium commercially in 2028 or 29. Even then the UK will still have to import about half of what it needs. Reliance on China isn’t over yet.\n\nSince they’ve been looking at lithium in Cornwall, “we’ve seen critical minerals go from ‘Who cares?’ to ‘Oh my goodness, what are we going to do?’” says Wrathall. “Why is Trump interested in Greenland? Minerals. Ukraine? Minerals. Canada? Minerals? I’m just hoping he doesn’t find out about Cornwall!”",

    "fullText": "China has unveiled plans for a space carrier that can deploy unmanned fighter jets capable of firing missiles from the edge of the Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nState media released a concept video of the futuristic Luanniao, the world’s biggest warship, travelling through space above all current defensive systems.\n\nChina claimed the carrier could become operational in 20 to 30 years’ time. However, experts were sceptical about the project and some likened it to a stunt designed to “inspire the Chinese public”.\n\nResembling a spaceship from a Star Wars film, the Luanniao will be a huge grey triangular aircraft carrier 242 metres long and 684 metres wide. It will have a take-off weight of 120,000 tons – significantly more than any similar craft in operation today.\n\nAccording to state media, the Luanniao will be designed to carry up to 88 unmanned Xuan Nu fighter jets. These will reportedly be highly manoeuvrable stealth aircraft capable of launching hypersonic missiles, but will be significantly heavier than drones.\n\nIf completed, the new spaceship would “outclass pretty much everyone”, according to Peter Layton, a defence expert and a visiting fellow at Australia’s Griffith Asia Institute.\n\nIt would be capable of flying over surface-to-air missiles and other fighter aircraft, he said, adding: “You’re also out of range of the weather, generally speaking – and you’re out of range of most defensive systems.”\n\nThe Luanniao could also allow Beijing to position it directly above targets and launch missiles at them.\n\nSuch capabilities would give China a significant advantage, including over Taiwan and in the South China Sea, which could be the scene of a future war against the United States.\n\nThe Luanniao is part of China’s broader Nantianmen Project, which translates to South Heavenly Gate.\n\nDeveloped by the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, the project encompasses a number of ambitious plans to expand the country’s air and space capabilities.\n\nOne of the most prominent elements is a sixth-generation fighter, known as the Baidi fighter, that will also be able to operate near space. A model of the jet was displayed at China’s International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition in 2024.\n\nThe Luanniao is the latest development in the ongoing space race between the US and China. Beijing has been investing in developing rockets and satellites in an effort to push the US out of the lead and, by some metrics, it is now winning.\n\nIn 2024, China successfully launched the Chang’e-6, a robotic spacecraft, which reached the Moon’s far side and returned to Earth with lunar samples.\n\nThe Chang’e-7 mission, which has the goal of finding water on the Moon’s surface, is planned for August.\n\nWhile the US still has leading capabilities, its momentum seems to be slowing while China’s is increasing.\n\nThe Luanniao, by far the most ambitious part of the Nantianmen Project, was first conceived more than 10 years ago, but was dismissed by most experts as a fantasy project. For many, it still is.\n\nThe technology needed for an aircraft to hover at the edge of the Earth’s atmospheric boundary and launch missiles towards the surface does not currently exist. It would require “enormous amounts of fuel” as well as a new kind of propulsion system that had yet to be developed, said Mr Layton.\n\nOne way in which China could achieve a similar result is by putting the carrier into orbit, similar to a satellite or rocket. However, in orbit the aircraft would be vulnerable to debris, which would destroy it in the event of a collision.\n\nTo launch the Luanniao into orbit, China would also need a reusable rocket. It has been working towards one for years, but has been unable to achieve it so far.\n\nBeijing could look to Elon Musk’s SpaceX reusable rockets for inspiration. However, the country is probably 10 to 15 years away from developing its own, said Mr Layton.\n\nGiven the major obstacles around the development of the Luanniao, the timing of Beijing’s announcement is likely to be part of a wider strategy – both at home and abroad.\n\nMr Layton explained that China used stunts like this to “inspire the Chinese public” and show itself to be at the cutting edge of technological innovation.\n\nPushing the narrative around futuristic spacecraft was part of a greater effort to demonstrate to its neighbours that it was a leading military power, he said.\n\n“For the external audience, it does paint the picture that they are working on technology that the region just can’t aspire to – it’s literally Star Wars stuff,” he added.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "This year China will see its solar capacity outstrip its coal capacity for the first time, according to an industry group.\n\nIn its latest projections, the China Electricity Council says that, by the end of 2026, wind and solar will account for nearly half of China’s power capacity. Including hydro and nuclear power, clean energy will amount to nearly two-thirds of total power capacity, while coal will amount to a third.\n\nImportantly, capacity refers to the maximum amount of electricity a power plant can produce. Coal plants run closer to their maximum than wind or solar plants. So while coal capacity now trails renewable capacity, coal still accounts for about half of all power produced in China.\n\nStill, that is starting to change. For years, China built renewable power and fossil power in tandem. But now, solar and wind aren’t just supplementing coal, they are displacing it.\n\nEven as China continues to build new coal plants, the average plant is also burning less coal. Competing with cheap solar and wind, a large share of coal plants are now operating at a loss. And under the latest government guidelines, coal will begin serving a more limited role. Increasingly, coal generators will act as “peaker” plants, meeting sudden spikes in power demand or gaps in the supply of wind and solar.\n\nPerversely, the coming decline of coal has spurred a rush to build new plants. Facing the prospect that Chinese leaders will further limit the use of coal, developers submitted a record number of proposals to build or reactivate coal power plants last year, according to a new analysis.\n\nLauri Myllyvirta, an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, believes that China is now at a crossroads.\n\n“You have to either put brakes on coal power plant construction and start closing down older coal power plants, or you have to slow down the clean energy expansion,” he said in an interview with Yale Environment 360. “That’s the choice that China’s policymakers are likely going to have to make within the next year or two.”",

    "fullText": "China has banned hidden door handles on electric vehicles (EVs), making it the first country to stop the use of the controversial designs that were made popular by multi-billionaire Elon Musk's Tesla.\n\nIt comes as EVs are facing scrutiny from safety watchdogs around the world after a number of deadly incidents, including two fatal crashes in China involving Xiaomi EVs in which power failures were suspected to have prevented doors from being opened.\n\nUnder the new regulations, cars will only be allowed to be sold if they have a mechanical release both on the inside and outside of their doors, according to state media.\n\nThe new rules are due to take effect on 1 January 2027.\n\nThe Ministry of Industry and Information Technology rules require the outside of every passenger door except the boot, to have a recessed space measuring no smaller than 6cm (2 in) by 2cm by 2.5cm to allow access to the handle.\n\nInside the car there must be signs measuring at least 1cm by 0.7cm to show how to open the door.\n\nCars that have already been approved by authorities and are in the final stages of entering the Chinese market will have another two years to update their designs.\n\nHidden handles are widely used in China's new energy vehicle (NEV) market, which includes EVs as well as hybrid cars and those powered by fuel cells.\n\nThey feature in about 60% of the top 100 best-selling NEVs, according to data cited by government-controlled newspaper China Daily.\n\nAlthough the measures will only apply to models sold in the Chinese market, the country's huge presence in the global car industry means the move is likely to have an impact around the world.\n\nTesla's door handles are already being investigated by US safety regulators and authorities in Europe are considering their own rules.\n\nIn November, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a probe focused on Tesla's electric-powered door handles, responding to reports that they suddenly stopped working, leaving children trapped in the cars.\n\nThe NHTSA said it had received nine complaints about the handles in Tesla's 2021 Model Y cars, the company's flagship model.\n\nIn four of the cases, the car owners resorted to breaking the window to resolve the issue.",

    "title": "China's Farming Robots Are A Lot More Than Just Fancy Tractors",
    "description": "Automation and robots are becoming mainstays in many industries, but researchers and farmers in China are taking innovation in smart farming to the next level.",
    "fullText": "Much has been made of the AI race between the U.S. and China as the two national powers jockey for leadership in the world's fastest-growing industry. To some Western observers, China's progress in autonomous robotics is a cause for concern. But the nation's robotics revolution extends far beyond surveillance and military uses, existing at the junction of increasingly capable computing, manufacturing, and industrialization capacities. This confluence is perhaps best exemplified by China's advancements in smart agriculture, where engineers are bringing autonomous robots to the country's crop farming, livestock, and aquaculture industries. By developing autonomous robots to help plant and harvest crops, control pests, identify diseases, monitor livestock health, and even socially engineer fish behavior, China has achieved several major milestones in its robotic farming program.\n\nBeijing highlighted its ambitions to boost AI farming in the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs' National Smart Agriculture Action Plan. In the plan, the government outlines its expectation for more than 30% of its agricultural production to be led by information-driven systems by 2026. Spearheading this nationwide smart-farming initiative is the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which has developed a national strategy for fostering groundbreaking advancements in robot-assisted farming throughout several Chinese provinces. To accelerate these developments, Beijing has established 34 innovation labs and 35 IT laboratories dedicated to smart agriculture. As a result, farms across the country have begun employing LLMs and autonomous robots in their operations. This trend could pioneer a new global agricultural landscape in which AI drives progress in multiple endeavors, from fighting potato blights to genetically modifying crops.\n\nRobotics is playing an increasingly important role in China's crop management systems. For instance, in China's Sichuan province, autonomous robots inspect rice fields using blacklight cameras, funneling data through their built-in AI systems to flag both pests and diseases. At another farm, \"smart brain\" systems remotely monitor fields to gather data on soil quality, crop health, and environmental trends, enabling forecasts on crop growth, yields, and pest outbreaks. One WeChat-controlled set of farming robots can plant seeds, harvest crops, and remove weeds.\n\nSome projects have even applied AI-driven robotics to crop breeding, with one team of scientists having sped up crop development by 400% using the technology, per SCMP. This process was facilitated by \"robot-friendly\" crops that are designed to be easier for robots to pollinate and harvest. By employing these same autonomous robotic systems, some Chinese farms have been able to fully automate their crop cultivation processes.\n\nBeijing's use cases for robotics in farming go beyond crops, however. One robot developed by Muyuan Foods Co., Ltd. utilizes smart sensors to monitor and analyze animal biometrics. Fisheries have also begun developing high-tech autonomous solutions that monitor fish behavior and growth patterns. For example, at Beijing's National Innovation Center for Digital Fishery, robotic fish modeled after tuna and dolphins swim through breeding tanks to monitor fish patterns, environment health, and net infrastructure; they achieve this without disturbing their aquatic counterparts. Developers hope these robotic fish might eventually lead schools of fish to designated harvesting and feeding areas, on top of potentially being used for deep-sea exploration.\n\nChina's robotics revolution coincides with broader leaps in data analysis and agricultural machinery. Using data from autonomous robots, drones, and other intelligent farming systems, Chinese engineers may be able to take the guesswork out of irrigation, pest control, and planting schedules. Farmers have begun using smart farming to analyze factors impacting crop growth — including temperature, rainfall, soil moisture, and mineral levels — to better define irrigation needs, plan drought responses, and predict ripeness. In one farm, autonomous drones collect crop maturity data to produce horticultural maps that can guide harvesting.\n\nCompounded with its advancements in robotics, China is also seeing substantial growth in its domestic machinery production. The nation exported $9.3 billion in agricultural machinery in the first half of 2025 — a 26.5% jump from the previous year, according to Global Times. Domestically produced intelligent harvesting technology, including AI-assisted corn harvesters, points to a major shift in an agricultural industry that has historically depended on imported high-end machinery. According to a Xinhua English-language report on seed technology, the northwestern Xinjiang region of China has seen particular success from these advancements, achieving a 97% mechanization rate in its cotton farming practices.\n\nSome experts do question the scalability of intelligent automated farming systems, particularly in a country with a diverse climate, geography, and crop output. These variables introduce significant challenges in building standardized, cost-effective autonomous farming systems — and given the industry's historically small profit margins, cost is a particularly pressing consideration. But combined with other technological leaps, such as \"smart soil\" that grows bigger crops with less water and insect drones that can pollinate crops, the global agriculture industry just might be on the precipice of its next technological revolution.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "fullText": "Silver prices crashed in a harrowing roller-coaster ride that underscored how quickly China's army of speculators can move global commodity markets — and how fast those gains can unravel.\n\nThe white metal has been in the spotlight over the past year after dramatically outperforming gold. Prices surged about 170% in 2025 and climbed more than 60% again in early 2026, vaulting silver to $121 per troy ounce at its peak before the rally spectacularly broke down.\n\nSpot silver was trading around $77.10 per troy ounce at 3:06 a.m. ET on Monday, having erased a large portion of its historic gains in just a few sessions.\n\nOn Friday, silver prices cratered as much as 36% as investors rushed to lock in profits following the meteoric rally and adjust positions.\n\nThe sell-off came on the back of President Donald Trump announcing Kevin Warsh as his pick for the next Federal Reserve chair. The move rattled markets and sparked a sharp reassessment of interest-rate expectations.\n\nEven before the meltdown, warning signs were flashing in China, where speculative trading had reached frenetic levels, leaving prices vulnerable to a rapid unwind.\n\n\"Before the correction, warning signs emerged on Tuesday as Chinese investors faced difficulties withdrawing funds from leveraged gold-trading accounts, and several Chinese funds halted subscriptions to manage overheating sentiment,\" wrote Fabien Yip, a market analyst at IG, on Monday.\n\nIn response to the volatility, major trading venues, including CME Group and the Shanghai Gold Exchange, raised margin requirements. Higher margins require traders to post more cash to hold positions. The move is aimed at cooling speculation but it often forces leveraged investors to sell — adding further downward pressure to prices.\n\n\"Price action was magnified by margin calls on leveraged positions, which further intensified selling pressure amongst other traders,\" Yip said.\n\nSilver's violent price reversal followed recent analyst warnings that silver's rally was running far ahead of underlying fundamentals.\n\nOle Hansen, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote last week that the surge was driven largely by retail demand for coins and bars, alongside \"strong and persistent demand\" from China that pushed silver prices in Shanghai to a widening premium over London benchmarks.\n\nWhen that speculative demand faltered, the impact rippled across the broader metals complex. The pullback rippled into other metals, including copper and platinum.\n\nGold, which had also enjoyed a powerful rally, wasn't spared. Spot gold was trading around $4,612 per ounce, after hitting a fresh record above $5,500 per ounce just last week.\n\nMarkets are now closely watching trading activity in China for further clues, particularly with risks building ahead of the long Chinese New Year holidays, when markets will be closed.\n\nThin liquidity during the break could amplify volatility once trading resumes — a prospect that has investors bracing for more sharp moves in the days ahead.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG/BEIJING, Jan 30 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's visit to China is the latest win Beijing can tout in its rivalry with Washington, but the deals he brings back to London also show the limits of the balancing act that middle powers may try to play.\n\nHe follows Canadian counterpart Mark ​Carney, who struck a trade deal on a similar visit weeks ago, before heading to Davos to herald a new global trade order as U.S. President Donald Trump disrupts long-standing ties with ‌allies.\n\nEuropean leaders have also visited, as have India's Narendra Modi and others since Trump began his second term a year ago, but it is less clear what tangible long-term economic and security benefits such visits yield for Western powers.\n\n\"Traditional U.S. allies feel hard done ‌by and are now hedging their bets, but they are far from being able or willing to substitute China for the United States,\" said John Quelch, an expert in global strategy at Duke Kunshan University.\n\nFrom the perspective of London, Ottawa and other Western capitals, the visits demonstrate to Trump that alternatives exist if he keeps up pressure on issues from Greenland to renegotiating the USMCA trade deal among the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nBut these are \"superficial gestures amid stalled global growth,\" said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis.\n\n\"These visits highlight the severe limits of any 'pivot' to China,\" she said. \"They expose middle powers' vulnerability, chasing scraps while China's export flood overwhelms their industries.\"\n\nAnd they ⁠benefit Beijing, by supporting the narrative of a broad pivot to China ‌as the world's \"reliable partner\", in contrast with Trump's chaotic tariff policies and his growing list of threats and demands towards partners and rivals alike.\n\n\"President Trump’s efforts to decouple the United States from China are also decoupling the United States from the world,\" Quelch added.\n\nSTARMER SCORES WINS ON VISAS, WHISKY\n\nThe deals clinched by Western powers on such ‍visits come in return for deeper integration with a country that ran a trade surplus the size of the Dutch economy last year but where consumption is too weak for even its own producers to prosper at home.\n\nOn his trip to the world's second largest economy, Starmer secured 30-day visa-free access for Britons travelling to China and lower tariffs on whisky, while British drugmaker AstraZeneca unveiled a $15 billion investment in China.\n\nHe got nothing beyond \"frank dialogue\" on tension arising from China's ​increasingly assertive stance on Taiwan, its stronger ties with Russia after the Ukraine invasion and a rights crackdown on Britain's former colony of Hong Kong.\n\nBritish and U.S. politicians who criticised Starmer's trip also aired accusations ‌of espionage and human rights abuse, which Beijing denies.\n\nSimilarly, Carney left China with expectations that Beijing will cut or drop tariffs on canola, lobsters, crabs and peas, but that triggered threats of 100% tariffs from Trump, who warned Ottawa about allowing Chinese EVs into North America.\n\nAnd even before Starmer has wrapped up his China visit, Trump warned Britain it was dangerous to get into business with Beijing, after the prime minister extolled the economic benefits of resetting relations with China.\n\nCHINA'S EXPORT-DRIVEN GROWTH POSES RISKS FOR WEST\n\nChina's imports last year were flat at $2.6 trillion, but they were largely driven by energy and commodities from emerging markets, rather than the West.\n\nIts trade surplus, however, jumped a fifth, to a record $1.2 trillion, as its manufacturers responded to Trump's tariff measures by muscling into virtually every other market in the world, at the expense of domestic producers.\n\nSuch a ⁠pace of growth puts China's trade surplus on track to roughly reach the size of the $3-trillion French economy by 2030 and ​the $5-trillion German economy by 2033.\n\nIts exports to the European Union last year jumped 8.4%, while imports dipped 0.4%. China shipped 7.8% ​more to Britain, while buying 4.7% less. With Canada, sales grew 3.2% while purchases plunged 10.4%.\n\n\"This makes it an especially risky proposition for countries trying to protect or grow their own manufacturing industries to substantially increase trade integration with China,\" said Eswar Prasad, a former China director at the International Monetary Fund.\n\n\"China hardly provides a safe harbour for ‍countries trying to cope with the adverse economic effects ⁠of U.S. tariffs,\" added Prasad, who now teaches trade policy at Cornell University.\n\nStill, say some analysts, significant trade wins with China may not be as important - or even realistic - for countries such as Britain or Canada right now.\n\nResetting ties may be the best they can get, but that could still be valuable, as previous deterioration in relations exposed critical supply chain dependencies on China.\n\nThe Asian ⁠giant's trade countermeasures helped to widen two-way trade imbalances, rather than narrow them, analysts said.\n\nThe visits by Starmer and Carney are \"a propaganda coup for Beijing,\" said Noah Barkin, Europe-China expert at the German Marshall Fund and Rhodium Group, while warning, \"This is not a ‌pivot to China. It is about reducing tension with Beijing.\"\n\nHe added, \"No country wants to be in open conflict with the two superpowers at the same time.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Liangping Gao ‌and Kevin Yao in Beijing and David Kirton in Shenzhen; Writing by Marius Zaharia; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)",

    "description": "The anti-corruption campaign has left open positions and a lack of senior officials with the experience to fill them.",
    "fullText": "China's drive to modernize its military to rival the US armed forces is running parallel with an aggressive purge of its senior leaders.\n\nThe People's Liberation Army has been repeatedly shaken by a massive anti-corruption campaign led by Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Now, the military leadership is under renewed scrutiny after one of China's most senior generals was placed under investigation.\n\nThe latest disruptions within the PLA, the world's largest military and one of its most powerful, raise questions about who is leading the force and how the shake-ups are affecting the military as an organization and impacting readiness.\n\nThis past weekend, China's defense ministry announced investigations into Gen. Zhang Youxia, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Liu Zhenli, the chief of staff of the commission's joint staff department. Zhang was widely believed to be one of Xi's trusted military advisors.\n\nAn editorial published in official PLA media said the two had \"seriously betrayed the trust and expectations\" of both the Communist Party and the CMC and \"fostered political and corruption problems that undermined the party's absolute leadership over the military and threatened the party's ruling foundation.\"\n\nAnalysts Business Insider spoke with said the accusations suggested more than just financial corruption, which has been the case for others. Rather, the language indicates Zhang and Liu challenged Xi's authority, whether through disagreements on modernization goals, failures to meet expectations, or power and influence struggles within the ranks. The reasons may never be known, as China's \"black box\" opacity increasingly blurs realities inside its government.\n\nA report from the Wall Street Journal raised the possibility Zhang leaked nuclear weapons data to the US. Business Inside is unable to independently verify the information.\n\nOf the seven officials appointed to the Central Military Commission in 2022, only two — Xi himself and Zhang Shengmin, the commission's anti-graft officer — remain in power. The rest are either under investigation or have been expelled.\n\nTwo defense ministers have been ousted, and last October, nine top PLA commanders were purged. The exact number of senior military leaders affected is unknown, but there are indications the purge has deeply impacted the senior officer corps.\n\nZhang is the highest-ranking official affected by Xi's crackdown on the military. And across the lower ranks of the PLA, dozens of other officers have been removed from their positions.\n\n\"This is kind of the ultimate crescendo of this anti-corruption campaign in the military,\" Jonathan Czin, an expert at the Brookings Institute who previously served as a top China analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency and director for China at the United States National Security Council, told Business Insider.\n\n\"It sends a very clear sign throughout the system that nobody is safe regardless of what kind of relationship you had or have with Xi Jinping,\" he said.\n\nMore investigations may follow those of Zhang and Liu. Officials with ties to the two men could come under suspicion as well, analysts said. Other senior people have been notably absent from important meetings in recent months, suggesting more shakeups.\n\nThat leaves Xi with a difficult next step: deciding who can credibly fill the vacancies.\n\nBecause so many senior officers have been removed or face investigations, \"the pool of candidates for refilling top positions has been winnowed,\" Brian Hart, the deputy director and fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies' China Power Project, told Business Insider. \"Xi could continue to use the existing command structure of the CMC and fill it with new people loyal to him,\" he added. \"It is also possible Xi could try to start over with a bit of a blank slate by more fundamentally remaking the PLA's leadership structure.\"\n\nFewer experienced commanders could slow coordination across China's military — a serious challenge for complex operations like a blockade or invasion of Taiwan.\n\nSome PLA watchers argue Xi appears willing to accept those short-term costs if the result is a force that is more politically loyal and disciplined over time. The PLA Daily editorial framed the campaign as a net positive, arguing that \"the more the People's Army fights corruption, the stronger, purer, and more combat-capable it becomes.\"\n\nA senior Pentagon official previously speculated that the extensive corruption in China's military was hindering its modernization.\n\nAmid disruptions in the force, China may seek to send a signal that shake-ups aren't affecting military readiness.\n\n\"You could actually see an uptick in the number of major exercises around Taiwan, but internally it could mask significant upheaval and disarray within the PLA,\" Lyle Morris, a senior fellow for foreign policy and national security at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis, told Business Insider.\n\nChina staged large joint exercises around Taiwan following earlier purge waves. Such actions could project readiness despite leadership turmoil.\n\nThe internal upheaval is likely having an effect, though, China watchers said. \"It is hard to deny that this creates challenges for the PLA in the short term,\" Hart said. \"Any leader deciding on using force would want senior leaders and commanders in place who are loyal, experienced, and effective in their roles. The immense turnover within the PLA's highest ranks complicates that.\"",

Academic Dishonesty, Political Selection, and Institutional Performance in China\n\n Zhuang Liu, \n\n Wenwei Peng \n\n & Shaoda Wang \n\n Working Paper 34747\n\n DOI 10.3386/w34747\n\n Issue Date January 2026\n\nHonesty is perceived as fundamental to societal functioning, motivating education systems worldwide to enforce strict oversight and heavy penalties for dishonest behavior. Yet much academic misconduct remains unexposed, and its broader consequences are further obscured by the sorting of individuals into careers based on probity. Applying advanced plagiarism-detection algorithms to half a million publicly available graduate dissertations in China, we uncover hidden misconduct and validate it against incentivized measures of honesty. Linking plagiarism records to rich administrative data, we document four main findings. First, plagiarism is pervasive and predicts adverse political selection: plagiarists are more likely to enter and advance in the public sector. Second, plagiarists perform worse when holding power: focusing on the judiciary and exploiting quasi-random case assignments, we find that judges with plagiarism histories issue more preferential rulings and attract a greater number of appeals — effects partly mitigated by trial livestreaming. Third, plagiarizing judges generate spillovers onto other judges and lawyers. Fourth, exploiting the staggered adoption of detection tools, we demonstrate that enforcing academic integrity leads to modest improvements in future professional conduct.\n\n Acknowledgements and Disclosures\n\nWe thank Ying Bai, Yiming Cao, Yunchien Chang, Chiman Cheung, Ruben Durante, Ray Fisman, Edward Glaeser, Guojun He, Andrew Kao, Muhammad Yasir Khan, Jonathan Klick, James Kung, Bingjing Li, Vincent Pons, Jesse Shapiro, Uta Schoenberg, Michael Song, Yongxiang Wang, Jaya Wen, Yanhui Wu, David Y.

    "fullText": "I love my Edison phonograph, my antique wall phone, and my grandmother's quilts. I have two sets of china and enough table linens to serve royalty. My husband and I are the repository of the older generations.\n\nOur kids explicitly told us they don't want any of our stuff. They tell me young people don't use elaborate china patterns; they don't cover anything with handmade lace doilies; they don't care that the rocking chair belonged to Great Grandpa.\n\nSo my house is filled with random items, augmented by things we've added over the years and by our affection for garage sales.\n\nNow that I'm 81. I know it's time to face the truth: If I don't declutter my house now, my kids will have to face the larger task after our deaths.\n\nMy husband and I have made a 2,500-square-foot, four-bedroom house a home. We have no plans to leave anytime soon. We love our home surrounded by acres of trees and wildlife. We hope to stay here for a long time. But soon, it will be our time.\n\nSomeday, someone will need to clean this house out, and it will most likely fall to our kids. So, we are starting the process now.\n\nEvery time our kids visit, they bring down more boxes from the attic. We sort the contents together, and it's actually kind of fun.\n\nI've finally acknowledged that the reason I love old things is because they represent the memories of the people who used them. Grandmother used to crochet in her chair; my mother loved setting the table for company; my father hooked up an old phone that actually works. But I've finally realized I can keep the memories without the things.\n\nI'm also just happier with less. One of the reasons I love our annual vacation to the Caribbean is that we take so little with us. We rent a condo; we cook our meals; we take just enough clothing to be covered. It's liberating not to have to rummage through 20 pairs of jeans to find my favorites.\n\nIt feels wrong to keep things unless you're using them. I don't need eight jackets, but there are people in our community who could benefit from one. I don't need my grandmother's crocheted afghans I store in the closet, but someone else might benefit from them. I don't need my childhood collection of ceramic horses, but they might bring happiness to another child.\n\nSure, I could sell these things on eBay, but it's more rewarding to give away all my prized possessions.\n\nA friend admired my cut-glass pitcher recently, so I just gave it to her. I've brought my collection of Annie Fellows' \"The Little Colonel\" stories to a book club friend for her granddaughter.\n\nI'm no longer teaching, so most of that wardrobe is going to the local Goodwill. I love tablecloths, but I'm keeping only my three favorites. I am looking for a home for the second set of china and way too many teacups.\n\nAs lifelong readers, my husband and I have a large collection. I always thought being surrounded by books felt cozy, so I stocked our home full of them. There are books in almost every room.\n\nExcept for \"The Joy of Cooking,\" I cleared out all the ones in the kitchen. A floor-to-ceiling bookcase in the hall is now half empty. I am thinning out the reference books in my office.\n\nUnfortunately, we found that donating books is harder than donating clothing or housewares, but there are places that accept them. Schools, libraries, thrift shops, retirement homes, and even prisons accept books in good condition.\n\nEven though this is a strange and difficult process, I know it's the right decision. Decluttering isn't just for me; it's about caring for and considering the people who will deal with what we leave behind.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING (AP) — U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in the Chinese financial center of Shanghai on Friday in his bid to boost business opportunities for British firms in the world's second-largest economy, just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump signaled a possible opposition to any deal between Beijing and London.\n\nWhy are foreign leaders increasing visits to Beijing?\n\nWhat agreement was reached on British lawmakers sanctions?\n\nWhat business opportunities is Starmer seeking in China?\n\nHow did Trump respond to UK-China negotiations?\n\nStarmer, the center-left Labour leader, has brought more than 50 business leaders on his trip to China, the first by a U.K. prime minister in eight years.\n\nStarmer suggested Trump’s criticism was aimed more at Canada than Britain. He added that Washington was aware in advance of his trip and its objectives and pointed out that Trump has said he plans to visit China this spring.\n\n“I don’t think it’s wise for the United Kingdom to stick its head in the sand,” Starmer told Sky News. “China is the second biggest economy in the world. Along with Hong Kong, it’s our third-biggest trading partner. And through this visit, we’ve opened up lots of opportunities for jobs and wealth creation.”\n\nStarmer started his trip in Beijing on Thursday, where he met with Chinese leaders including Xi Jinping. The two pledged to pursue a long-term and stable strategic partnership in what was seen as a sign of improving ties after several years of friction between the two countries.\n\nIn Washington, Trump suggested that he may oppose any deal between Beijing and London, and then pivoted to Canada, with which he has had a series of sharp exchanges since Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visited China earlier this month.\n\n“Well, it’s very dangerous for them to do that,” he said, when asked about Starmer’s visit and any U.K. trade talks with Beijing. “And it’s even more dangerous, I think, for Canada to get into business with China. Canada is not doing well. They’re doing very poorly.”\n\n“You can’t look at China as the answer,” he said.\n\nStarmer and Carney are among a series of foreign leaders to visit Beijing as their nations seek to improve ties with China. Many have seen their countries’ economies buffeted by Trump’s tariffs and are looking to expand other export markets.\n\nThe British prime minister said Xi agreed to remove a travel ban that had been imposed on several British lawmakers after the U.K.'s former center-right Conservative government joined the European Union, Canada and the U.S. in imposing sanctions on four Chinese officials over evidence of rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim people in the far western Xinjiang region.\n\n“This has been a cause of concern in Parliament and for parliamentarians for some time and that is why I raised it on this visit,\" Starmer told ITV News. “The response from the Chinese is that the restrictions no longer apply and President Xi has told me that that means that all parliamentarians are welcome to visit.”",

    "fullText": "Intrigued by automated driving? Perhaps you've already tried one of the real Waymo or Zoox robotaxis in the United States. (Tesla's \"robotaxis\" probably don't count yet.)\n\nChina is the other real global hotspot for automated driving, with some of its biggest companies eager to expand around the world. Yet many people in the West — even many experts — don't really understand what's happening on China's streets. Often, we hear people simply claim that China is either way ahead or way behind.\n\nTogether, we have more than three decades of experience working on automated driving in industry and academia. Since meeting at Stanford University, we've collectively spent countless hours riding in Chinese as well as American robotaxis.\n\nWe wrote this piece to share our experiences in China and to help you plan — or even daydream — your own.\n\nPerhaps you'll marvel as your robotaxi skillfully navigates streets filled not just with cars but with bikes going every which way. Or you might sit sheepishly as it tries to turn itself around in a crowded intersection. You'll see some passersby who are shocked you're in a car without a driver, as well as others who are just annoyed you're in their way.\n\nIn other words, you'll encounter everyday people as they — and you — try to make sense of the robotaxis coming our way fast.\n\nHere's what we've learned about robotaxis in China on our (driverless) adventures, and here's how you can ride too.\n\nChina's three largest robotaxi developers are Baidu Apollo, Pony.ai, and WeRide. Each operates in China and is also pursuing services in other parts of the world, including Europe and the Middle East.\n\nBaidu Apollo is the automated driving unit of Baidu (BIDU on Nasdaq), often compared to Alphabet, which owns both Waymo and Google. You can get the Baidu Apollo Go app by searching for 萝卜快跑 in a Chinese app store. The first part of this name intentionally sounds like \"robot,\" but it actually means \"radish.\"\n\nPony.AI (PONY on Nasdaq) is a startup based in both China and the United States. You can get the PonyPilot app by searching for 小马智行 in a Chinese app store.\n\nWeRide (WRD on Nasdaq) is a startup that operates robotaxis, as well as automated shuttles along specific routes. You can get the WeRide Go app by searching for 文远知行 in a Chinese app store.\n\nThese companies differ in their approaches. For example, unlike many of its competitors, Baidu sometimes uses remote drivers rather than mere remote assistants. Perhaps as a result, Baidu already sends its robotaxis on some freeways without safety drivers inside. (Waymo only recently expanded its service to a few US freeways.)\n\nOther companies are also developing automated vehicles in China — but, at least in our experience, they tend to be active in very limited areas or still rely heavily on safety drivers.\n\nMany Chinese cities — including some megacities you may have never heard of — have at least some automated driving activity.\n\nIf you're coming in search of robotaxis, you can't go wrong with five of the more famous: Beijing (the capital), Shanghai (the financial hub), Wuhan (China's \"Chicago\"), and Guangzhou and Shenzhen (neighbors in the tech-heavy province of Guangdong near Hong Kong).\n\nWhereas Waymo's robotaxis can pick you up almost anywhere in San Francisco or Phoenix, you'll need to go find the robotaxis in Chinese cities. Services are generally confined to pilot zones covering only portions of each city, and an individual robotaxi company might provide truly driverless service in only part of a given pilot zone.\n\nThat said, comparisons are difficult: While Beijing's primary pilot zone may appear small, it is roughly similar in geographic size and population to all of San Francisco.\n\nBecause Baidu, Pony, and WeRide are all active here, Beijing provides a good introduction to Chinese robotaxis. Most of the capital's automated driving activity takes place in the southeastern Yizhuang area. (You'll know you're there when you see numerous automated vehicles marked with a BJHAD logo in the shape of a car.)\n\nVisit Yizhuang during the day — not during rush hours when services may pause or fill up, and not at night when they generally stop. Some robotaxi companies offer connections to and from South Railway Station and Daxing Airport, but these runs can be sporadic, may require advance booking, and currently use in-vehicle safety drivers.\n\nShanghai has several areas where, at least in theory, you can take a ride in a robotaxi. Remember that Shanghai is enormous; as in Beijing, you may need to travel by subway or taxi for an hour just to reach a robotaxi.\n\nPony serves a relatively small area east of Shanghai's famous central business district. From the CBD (or from the super-fast maglev train that serves Pudong Airport), head to Yunshun Road station. Yunshun Road is not Yunshan Road!\n\nIf you're near Hongqiao Airport (or its intercity rail station) on Shanghai's far west side, explore the various services in Jiading. We recommend a bus or taxi ride to Poly International Plaza to try out Baidu and Pony. Didi Rider (滴滴出行) and SAIC (上汽集团) also have limited operations nearby.\n\nLocals like to say that Baidu chose Wuhan because the city's human drivers are notoriously bad. At this point, the city's ubiquitous Apollo robotaxis probably offer China's best example of an automated vehicle service that ordinary commuters rely on. You can even get to and from the airport without a human at the wheel.\n\nAs with all the companies, there are caveats: You might be within Apollo's service area but not near one of its designated pick-up points, and some major destinations are still just out of reach. If you're already in the center, start at Hongtu Avenue station near Jinyingtan Hospital.\n\nSome of our more exciting robotaxi experiences (other than on Wuhan's freeways) were in Shenzhen and Guangzhou.\n\nMany \"robotaxis\" in these two cities actually had human safety drivers. And some of the vehicles that were driverless perhaps should not have been.\n\nShenzhen has officially opened the entire metropolis to robotaxis, but in practice, companies still serve only limited areas.\n\nGuangzhou has integrated automated shuttles into parts of its public transport network, which shows how automated mobility is more than just robotaxis.\n\nThe apps you'll use to book your robotaxi trips are both fun and frustrating. Most are available only in Chinese, so a screen translation app compatible with the Chinese internet is essential.\n\nSome apps won't show their robotaxis until you're physically in their service area. Some require you to manually set (and, crucially, to update) your desired service area in the settings; otherwise, they may incorrectly show no availability. And some let you choose between driverless and driver-supervised rides.\n\nAlternatively, the mapping apps Baidu Maps and Amaps each show their preferred robotaxi company if you're in a service area and you've toggled the robotaxi option. (Look for the Chinese term 无人车.)\n\nOnce you request a ride, some apps indicate your queue position. But if robotaxi service has been suspended due to weather or other reasons, a perpetual queue might be your only clue that your ride isn't coming.\n\nChina has recently loosened some of its travel restrictions. This means citizens of many European countries do not need travel visas for short visits.\n\nIf you're a US citizen, you do need to get a visa in advance — unless you're spending only a few days there on your way to somewhere else.\n\nCheck with your regional Chinese consulate, or turn to a commercial visa service. It's not onerous.\n\nYou'll need a mainland Chinese phone number to register for most robotaxi services — as well as to use many other Chinese apps that are linked to physical things in the real world. A foreign number, Hong Kong number, or data-only eSIM is unlikely to suffice.\n\nFortunately, once you arrive in China (and sometimes even in the airport), you can buy or rent a prepaid Chinese phone. Remember to bring your passport — and make sure you get an actual mainland number (+86 followed by 11 digits).\n\nYou can also ask the salesperson for the best app to translate your screen from Chinese to English. Remember that the Chinese internet is quite different from the internet you know. For example, even with a VPN, you might not be able to use any Google services.\n\nThe Western app stores for Apple and Android have international versions of major apps such as WeChat (for messaging and payments), Alipay (for payments and public transport), and Didi (for taxis). Beyond these basic functions, however, many of these apps (or the miniapps within them) may still require a Chinese phone number.\n\nOnce your robotaxi trip is underway, you can change your destination — though the number of times varies by provider.\n\nAs long as the app or in-vehicle screen lets you, this is a great way to spend more time in robotaxis rather than waiting for them.\n\nThis also shows how a company handles route changes. For example, Pony will quickly undertake U-turns (or even three-point turns), which can make for interesting maneuvers on already chaotic streets.\n\nIf all this sounds complicated, don't worry: The quirks of early robotaxis are part of the experience. China is becoming more accessible to foreigners, and some of the hurdles we've described may have even fallen by the time you visit.\n\nRegardless, the people you'll meet are almost always willing to help. Even if they don't speak English, they're impressively proficient with translation apps.\n\nAs with any trip, carefully consult travel guidance from your government. But if you'd like to be a robotaxi tourist, China should be high on your list. The country's robotaxis aren't perfect, but they're ahead of most of the world — and well worth the trip.\n\nBryant Walker Smith, a professor at the University of South Carolina and a visiting professor at Renmin University of China, studies the law and policy of AI generally and automated driving specifically.

    "fullText": "(Reuters) - China has given its top AI startup DeepSeek approval to buy Nvidia's (NVDA) H200 artificial intelligence chips with regulatory conditions that ​are still being finalised, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang told reporters in Taipei on Thursday that his company had not received such information. He added that he believed that China was still finalising the licence. Nvidia did not respond to a request for comment on DeepSeek's approval.\n\nChina's industry and commerce ministries ⁠have granted approvals for all ‌four companies, but have stipulated that they will impose conditions that are still being finalised, the sources said. These conditions are being decided by ‍China's state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), according to one of the people.\n\nWhat congressional scrutiny could DeepSeek chip purchases face?\n\nWhat regulatory conditions apply to DeepSeek's H200 approval?\n\nWhat makes DeepSeek significant in the AI industry?\n\nHow does this fit into broader U.S.-China relations?\n\nChina's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Ministry of Commerce and NDRC did not answer requests for comment.\n\nDeepSeek, which rattled ​the global tech sector early last year by rolling out AI models that cost ‌a fraction of those being developed by U.S. rivals such as OpenAI (OPAI.PVT), did not answer a request for comment.\n\nThe H200, Nvidia's second most powerful AI chip, has emerged as a major flashpoint in U.S.-China relations. Despite strong demand from Chinese firms and U.S. approval for exports, Beijing's hesitation to allow imports has been the main barrier to shipments.\n\nThe U.S. earlier this month formally ⁠cleared the way for Nvidia to sell the H200 ​to China, where the company is seeing strong appetite. ​However, Chinese authorities have the final say on whether they would allow it to be shipped in.\n\nAny purchases of H200 chips by DeepSeek could draw ‍scrutiny by U.S lawmakers. ⁠Reuters reported on Wednesday that a senior U.S lawmaker had alleged that Nvidia had helped DeepSeek hone artificial intelligence models that were later used by the Chinese military, ⁠according to a letter sent to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\nDeepSeek is expected to launch its next-generation AI ‌model V4, featuring strong coding capabilities, in mid-February, The Information reported earlier this ‌month.",

    "fullText": "PANAMA CITY (AP) — Panama's president moved to assure the public on Friday that critical ports at both ends of the Panama Canal will continue to operate without interruption — a day after the country’s Supreme Court ruled that the concession held by a subsidiary of Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison Holdings was unconstitutional.\n\nThe court's decision late Thursday advances a U.S. aim to block any influence by China over the strategic waterway and immediately drew a sharp rebuke from Beijing.\n\nPanamanian President José Raúl Mulino said that until the court's ruling is executed — a period of time he did not specify — Panama's Maritime Authority would work with Panama Ports Company, the CK Hutchison subsidiary, to ensure continuing operations at the port.\n\nOnce the concession is formally ended, a local subsidiary of Danish logistics company A.P. Moller-Maersk will operate the ports in a transitional phase until a new concession can be bid and awarded, Mulino said.\n\n“Panama moves forward, its ports will continue operating without interruption and we will continue serving the world at the logistics center of excellence that we are,” Mulino said in a recorded video address.\n\nThe court’s ruling followed an audit by Panama’s comptroller, which alleged irregularities in the 25-year extension of the concession, granted in 2021.\n\nThe Trump administration made blocking China’s influence over the Panama Canal one of its priorities in the hemisphere. Panama was U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s first overseas stop as the United States’ top diplomat. On Friday, Rubio said on X that “the United States is encouraged by the recent Panamanian Supreme Court’s decision to rule port concessions to China unconstitutional.”\n\nDespite the insistence by Panama’s government and the canal authority that China has no influence over its operations, Rubio made clear that the U.S. viewed the operation of the ports as a national security issue. U.S. President Donald Trump had gone so far as to say Panama should return the canal to U.S. control.\n\nThe court’s brief statement gave no guidance on what would happen to the ports now.\n\nThe ruling draws backlash from Hong Kong\n\nCK Hutchison’s subsidiary, Panama Ports Company, said it has not been notified yet about the decision but insisted its concession was the result of transparent international bidding.\n\nIt said in its statement that the ruling “lacks legal basis and jeopardizes not only PPC and its contract, but also the well-being and stability of thousands of Panamanian families who depend directly and indirectly on port activity, but also the rule of law and legal certainty in the country.”\n\nIt said that it reserves all rights to proceed legally in Panama or elsewhere, but gave no more details.\n\nThe Hong Kong government firmly rejected the ruling in a statement, saying it strongly opposes any foreign government using coercive, repressive or other unreasonable means to seriously harm the business interests of Hong Kong enterprises. It said the Panamanian government should respect the spirit of contracts and provide a fair business environment.\n\n“Given the current situation in Panama, Hong Kong enterprises should carefully review their existing and future investments there,\" it said.\n\nIn Beijing, China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, told reporters that China would take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of “the Chinese company,” without elaborating on the potential steps.\n\nPolitical analyst Edwin Cabrera said once the parties are notified, the issue of what to do with the ports goes to Panama’s executive branch, specifically the Panama Maritime Authority.\n\n“I have the impression from conversations that I have had with some people that the operation (of the ports) will not stop,” Cabrera said.\n\nA sale deal that apparently angered Beijing\n\nCK Hutchison Holdings announced a deal last year to sell its majority stake in the Panamanian ports and others around the world to an international consortium that included BlackRock Inc. But the deal appeared to stall over objections by the Chinese government.\n\nThe company said last July that it was considering seeking a Chinese investor to join as a significant member of the consortium, a move that some interpreted as way to please Beijing, but CK Hutchison hasn't said more since.\n\nThe awkward position the company found itself in highlights the challenges Hong Kong business elites face in navigating Beijing’s expectations of national loyalty, especially when relations between China and the United States are strained. CK Hutchison is owned by the family of Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing.\n\nLast year, Panama’s comptroller audited the concession to the Panama Ports Company, which had held the contract to operate the ports since 1997. The concession was renewed in 2021 for 25 years, during the prior Panamanian administration.\n\nComptroller Anel Flores said the audit found payments that were not made, accounting errors and the apparent existence of “ghost” concessions operating within the ports since 2015. The company denied those allegations.\n\nThe audit determined that the irregularities had cost the government about $300 million since the concession was extended and an estimated $1.2 billion during the original 25-year contract.\n\nFlores also said the extension was granted without the required endorsement of his office.\n\nOn July 30, the comptroller challenged the Panama Ports Company’s contract to operate the ports before the Supreme Court.",

    "title": "Chinese fishing boats have been making some unusual moves lately in the East China Sea, satellite images and shipping data show",
    "description": "Shipping data showed the vessels gathering in distinct, coordinated lines in the East China Sea twice in recent weeks.",
    "fullText": "Thousands of Chinese fishing vessels amassed in what appeared to be coordinated formations in the East China Sea in recent weeks. Experts say the unusual display suggests more than regular commercial activity.\n\nShipping data tracked these formations, which China watchers and experts familiar with such activities in the region said were unprecedented in scale and highly inconsistent with normal fishing practices.\n\nExperts said this behavior appears linked to China's Maritime Militia, a shadowy, state-directed fleet that Beijing often uses to assert control over contested waterways without triggering a direct military confrontation. It's a prominent yet deniable force. China has rejected such assessments of the activity.\n\nThe first of these irregular movements of Chinese fishing boats occurred on December 25, with more than 2,000 ships forming two reverse L shapes with lines over 290 miles long off the coast of Shanghai. Then, on January 11, almost 1,500 vessels were spotted forming a single line in the same waters stretching roughly 300 miles. The New York Times first reported these activities.\n\nThe number of vessels in the area alone was enough to surprise some experts. \"In observing this type of data for years, I've never seen anything like this,\" Harrison Prétat, deputy director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Business Insider. \"Maybe my initial impression was, okay, is this some type of error, some type of mistake because the number of ships involved is more than anything I've seen before.\"\n\nData from Starboard Maritime Intelligence showed that in both instances, the fishing boats initially dispersed across the East China Sea converged over several days into a defined area, where they formed coordinated alignments. Satellite imagery from Planet Labs on January 10 captured large numbers of vessels moving toward the zone.\n\nOnce in position, they went idle. The vessels remained in those lines for hours before dispersing.\n\n\"The scale, geometry, coordination, and rapid assembly and dispersal of these formations are simply irreconcilable with normal fishing behavior,\" Andrew S. Erickson, a professor at the US Naval War College and expert on the Chinese Maritime Militia, told Business Insider.\n\nSpeaking in a personal capacity and not for the college or Navy, he called it a \"huge, precisely geo-coordinated flash mob.\"\n\nExperts in this space said the pattern of behavior aligns with what is known about how China's Maritime Militia operates.\n\n\"Beijing subsidizes various local and provincial commercial organizations to operate China Maritime Militia vessels to perform 'official' missions on an ad hoc basis outside of their regular civilian commercial activities,\" the Pentagon said in its most recent assessment of China's military.\n\n\"China Maritime Militia units,\" the DoD said, \"employ marine industry workers, usually fishermen, to supplement the PLAN [People's Liberation Army's Navy] and the China Coast Guard. While retaining their day jobs, these mariners are organized and trained, often by the PLAN and the China Coast Guard, and can be activated on demand.\"\n\nThe militia offers China an option for enforcing territorial claims in disputed waters in the South China Sea in ways that aren't as consequential as it might be were China's navy or coast guard to get involved. The militia isn't new, but it is believed to have grown in size and reach over the past decade, engaging in increasingly visible gray zone actions.\n\n\"In contrast to recent years, a majority of ships spent most of their days anchored at China's military outposts rather than at unoccupied reefs where they might pretend to fish. This suggests Chinese authorities are not pressuring vessel owners to maintain the crumbling façade of the militia as a legitimate fishing fleet,\" the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative said in February 2025.\n\nPrétat said the events in December and January might be \"some kind of early test of the ability to organize fishing ships geographically.\" The purpose, though, remains unclear.\n\nErickson told Business Insider it could plausibly be signaling, practice for mobilizing forces, or training.\n\n\"It underscores the reality that this third PRC [People's Republic of China] sea force engages in threatening gray zone operations and war-preparation activities not only in the South China Sea, but also in the East China Sea, with implications for Taiwan, Japan, regional security, and vital US interests,\" he said.\n\nThe Pentagon assesses that in a wartime scenario, such as a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, the Maritime Militia could support combat operations in part by creating obstacles to foreign military intervention.\n\nBut Prétat told Business Insider a major concern could also be a militia blockade that assists in \"dissuading, rerouting, and ultimately stopping commercial traffic, cargo, fuel shipments to Taiwan.\"\n\nThe Chinese embassy in the US told Business Insider the East China Sea is an important area for fishing and said that the period from November to February is peak for winter fishing.\n\n\"It is therefore normal to see a high concentration of fishing boats operating at sea during this time,\" embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said. \"Referring to the Chinese fishermen as 'maritime militia' shows malicious intent driven by ulterior motives.\"",

    "title": "AI health care is taking off in China, led by Jack Ma's Ant Group",
    "description": "Ant’s health chatbot has become a top downloaded app in China as users seek personalized care they can’t get from the overburdened hospitals.",
    "fullText": "Ant Group, Alibaba’s fintech affiliate and parent of China’s ubiquitous payment app Alipay, is racing to lead the country’s digital health market with a chatbot designed to be a wellness companion.\n\nIts app, Ant Afu, uses artificial intelligence and agentic capabilities to answer health-related questions, suggest hospital appointments, analyze test results, and remind users to exercise or take medication. First created in June under the name AQ, it had recorded 30 million monthly active users by January, with more than half of them living in small cities, according to Ant Group’s chief executive Han Xinyi.\n\nInternet users have increasingly turned to AI for everyday health questions and companionship, especially in markets where access to physicians is limited. Despite concerns about patient safety and data privacy, products like Ant Afu are widely embraced in China as consumers seek more personalized, round-the-clock health support.\n\nChina’s primary care system is underdeveloped. Most people seek treatment for everything from the flu to cancer at sprawling, overcrowded public hospitals that are concentrated in big cities. Patients often complain of long wait times, short consultations, and poor bedside manner of exhausted clinicians.\n\nThis demand for better care, combined with a fast-aging population, has created a fertile ground for digital health products that can spare people the burden of visiting hospitals. Tech companies including JD.com, ByteDance, and Baidu have all built online medical consultation tools, and more recently, chatbots branded as AI doctors.\n\nAnt has a unique advantage as Alipay has long hosted the appointment and payment systems for many hospitals. Millions of people access their national medical insurance accounts through Alipay. In January 2025, Ant acquired Haodf, a leading online consultation portal with more than 300,000 registered physicians.\n\nIn the U.S., AI companies are also expanding their health-care offerings, but they do not yet offer direct access to the country’s large number of private providers and insurers. This month, both OpenAI and Anthropic announced tools targeting consumers, health-care providers, and clinical researchers. Both ChatGPT and Claude now offer features that analyze users’ medical reports and fitness data.\n\nAmong its domestic rivals, Ant’s extensive partnerships with regulators, hospitals, and doctors give it an edge in the AI health-care race, Ivy Yang, a China tech analyst and founder of New York-based consulting firm Wavelet Strategy, told Rest of World. On Ant Afu, users can ask health-related questions, book online consultations and offline appointments at major hospitals, and get reimbursed by state or commercial insurance.\n\n“For startups, the bureaucratic red tape and initial investment required to build the platform, be compliant with all health-care data [regulations], and deal with various government agencies seem like too big a hurdle to overcome,” Yang said.\n\nAnt’s foray into health care has been endorsed by its billionaire founder Jack Ma. He came up with the name Afu, because it made the chatbot sound like a friend, chief executive Han told Chinese tech outlet Latepost this month. “He really cares about whether or not Afu can be like an AI friend that offers emotional companionship and humane care,” Han said, “rather than being just a tool for solving professional problems.”\n\nMa hopes to one day launch the app in underdeveloped parts of Africa and Southeast Asia, Han said.\n\nAnt has spent tens of millions of dollars marketing Afu in China, according to Han. Ant Afu ads have popped up in subway stations, on social media feeds, inside public restrooms, and have been painted on walls in rural China, according to photos shared online. By the end of January, Ant Afu ranked among the top ten most-downloaded iOS apps in China, according to Sensor Tower data.\n\nThe expanding role of AI in patient care, a largely unregulated area, has also prompted warnings about misinformation around the world.  A recent investigation by The Guardian found that Google’s AI summaries were giving out inaccurate health advice. Academics have also found AI diagnostic tools to harbor racial or socioeconomic biases.",

    "fullText": "Chery has launched its first battery electric pickup in China under its Rely pickup brand, with pricing starting at 127,800 yuan, about $18,300, and running up to 158,800 yuan for higher trims. \n\nThe truck is positioned as a work-ready electric option with mainstream sizing, multiple drivetrains, and a tech-heavy cabin, arriving as new energy pickups become one of the fastest-growing niches in China.\n\nView the 3 images of this gallery on the original article\n\nEarly reports describe the Rely R08 EV as a body-on-frame pickup offered in six variants. Dimensions are listed at 5,330 mm long, 1,920 mm wide, and 1,890 mm tall, with a 3,230 mm wheelbase, putting it in the midsize-to-fullsize zone by global standards.\n\nPowertrain choices include a single-motor rear-wheel-drive model and a dual-motor all-wheel-drive model, with outputs cited at 150 kW for RWD and 300 kW for AWD. Range is reported at up to 510 km on the CLTC cycle depending on trim, which is the figure Chinese brands typically use for domestic marketing and it generally reads higher than EPA-style numbers.\n\nView the 2 images of this gallery on the original article\n\nThe R08 EV is also being pitched as modern inside, with reports citing an infotainment setup using a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8155 chip in some versions. Driver assistance is described as Level 2 capable depending on trim, with commonly listed features such as adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assistance, and automatic emergency braking. \n\nThis is the typical spec mix for value-focused Chinese EVs, where the headline is less about a single breakthrough feature and more about offering a complete equipment list at a low entry price.\n\nPickups are still a smaller segment in China than in North America, with 2025 pickup sales cited at about 589,000 units. What is changing quickly is electrification, with new energy pickup volume cited at roughly 73,000 units in 2025, up about 243 percent year over year, which helps explain why Chery is moving into the category now. \n\nA base price around $18,300 is part of that strategy, because it creates a lower barrier for buyers who want a truck shape for utility but have been priced out of many electric offerings. Chery’s wider EV messaging continues to lean into future battery narratives. It also fits a product portfolio that mixes mainstream launches with attention-grabbing ideas, and off-road EV projects.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Jan 29 (Reuters) - China's main space contractor vowed to develop space tourism in the next five years, state media reported on Thursday, as Beijing revs up its commercial spaceflight and deep space exploration ambitions ​amid a technology race with the U.S.\n\nState-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) said it would \"achieve the flight operation of ‌suborbital space tourism and gradually develop orbital space tourism,\" as well as \"build a gigawatt-level space digital intelligence infrastructure\", state broadcaster CCTV reported.\n\nChina and the U.S. are competing ‌as they look to turn space exploration into a commercially viable business similar to civil aviation, as well as becoming the first to exploit the military and strategic advantages of space dominance. CASC has vowed to transform China into a \"world-leading space power\" by 2045.\n\nBeijing's key bottleneck so far is its failure to complete a reusable rocket test. U.S. rival SpaceX's Falcon 9 reusable rocket has allowed its subsidiary Starlink to ⁠achieve a near-monopoly on low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites ‌and it is also used for orbital space tourism.\n\nReusability is crucial to lowering the costs of rocket launches and making it cheaper to send satellites into space. China achieved a record 93 space launches ‍last year, according to official announcements, buoyed by its rapidly maturing commercial spaceflight startups.\n\nHowever, China has repeatedly described SpaceX's monopoly on LEO satellites as a national security risk and is launching its own satellite constellations, which it hopes will number in the tens of thousands within the next decades.\n\nIn late ​December, Chinese entities submitted filings with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) laying out plans to put about 200,000 satellites in orbit over ‌the next 14 years. Two mega-constellations account for the vast majority, and the move would strategically reserve suborbital slots and frequencies for Beijing.\n\nCASC's plans were announced after China inaugurated its first School of Interstellar Navigation housed in the Chinese Academy of Sciences on Tuesday, aiming to foster the next generation of space talent in frontier fields including interstellar propulsion and deep space navigation.\n\nThe new institution signals China's ambitions to strategically transition from near-Earth orbit operations to deep space exploration, and will support China's planned lunar research station and efforts in ⁠detecting planets outside our solar system, according to a Xinhua report on ​the inauguration.\n\n\"The next 10 to 20 years will be a window for leapfrog ​development in China's interstellar navigation field. Original innovation in basic research and technological breakthroughs will reshape the pattern of deep space exploration,\" Xinhua wrote.\n\nThursday's CCTV report said CASC would also focus on breakthroughs in key technologies ‍such as small celestial resource exploration ⁠and intelligent independent mining and step up monitoring of space debris and the formulation of international space traffic management rules.\n\nChina's Chang'e-6 lunar probe was the first spacecraft to bring back samples from the far side of the moon in 2024, and ⁠Beijing is actively setting international standards for spaceflight and space infrastructure to establish itself as a dominant space power.\n\nThe U.S. faces intense competition this decade from ‌China in its effort to return astronauts to the moon, where no humans have gone since the final U.S. ‌Apollo mission in 1972.",

    "fullText": "Starmer’s team is wary of spies but such fears are not new – with Theresa May once warned to get dressed under a duvet\n\nWhen prime ministers travel to China, heightened security arrangements are a given – as is the quiet game of cat and mouse that takes place behind the scenes as each country tests out each other’s tradecraft and capabilities.\n\nKeir Starmer’s team has been issued with burner phones and fresh sim cards, and is using temporary email addresses, to prevent devices being loaded with spyware or UK government servers being hacked into.\n\nThe employment of such tactics may sound dramatic but they are par for the course in an age of digital espionage and information security. Burner phones, for example, are routinely used by No 10 on some trips abroad – at G20 the summits in Brazil in 2024 and South Africa in 2025, for example – though not on visits to allied nations or Five Eyes intelligence partners.\n\nFor visits to China these precautions have been standard for at least a decade, such is the expectation that Beijing will eavesdrop and monitor.\n\nWhen she was prime minister, Theresa May was warned ahead of her trip to Beijing in 2018 to get dressed under the duvet to ensure that spy cameras would not film her without any clothes on. It was advice that was passed on generally by officials to all those travelling on the trip eight years ago.\n\nConcerns about peeping tom surveillance are particularly relevant to those in the official entourage or business and press delegations staying in hotels. “There was a well-worn routine in places like Shenzhen that foreigners from the west would be assigned the same rooms so they wouldn’t have to move the equipment,” a former senior British intelligence official said. Those with time on their hands would try to find the concealed bugging devices for fun.\n\nWhen Gordon Brown visited China in 2008, an aide was victim of a honey trap. The male aide met a Chinese woman at a lively hotel disco in Shanghai and left with her. The next day, he reported that his BlackBerry phone was missing. He was reprimanded, though No 10 said there had been no security compromise.\n\nPart of the standard security guidance given to ministers and their aides reflects this incident. “The rest of the advice,” the senior security official said, “was warning middle-aged men that if an attractive young Chinese woman appeared interested in you, she probably wasn’t”.\n\nMichael Gove, writing in the Mail last year, recalled being given similar warnings before being dispatched on a ministerial trip in 2010: “I was also told that if anyone from the opposite sex who approached me was out of my league they had only one thing on their mind – and it wasn’t comparing notes on Confucian philosophy.”\n\nDavid Cameron visited Beijing as prime minister in December 2013. A former aide recalled that China insisted on supplying a personal protection officer “over six-and-a-half-foot tall” to follow the British prime minister and his team as closely as reasonably possible.\n\nThe practice, again, is relatively standard, but it offered an obvious possibility for low level information gathering. “At the end of the trip after pretending he couldn’t speak or understand, at the plane he said goodbye and safe travels in perfect English,” they recalled, presumably as a reminder they were being watched.\n\nGeneral guidance, according to one British official who visited Beijing, “is that everything is bugged” and the only area for sensitive or secret conversations and debriefs is the secure compartment in the British embassy.\n\nSimilar considerations apply when meeting Chinese leaders or officials – at international summits – or when visiting the country’s diplomatic premises in London or elsewhere.\n\nWhen James Cleverly was foreign secretary, a former adviser recalled that during the UN general assembly in New York, he and his team refused to take their mobiles into the Chinese consulate. The handsets were all stored in a lead-lined bag in the hands of officials who did not go inside the diplomatic building.\n\nOne of the consequences of this abundance of caution is that ministers are out of ordinary contact in China, meaning their families cannot easily get in contact, having instead to communicate via a private secretary or other close aide.\n\nIt can also cause other political issues, as happened to Vince Cable in 2014. The Lib Dem, who was then business secretary, was visiting China and did not have his mobile phone with him. Back in the UK, an old ally, Matthew Oakeshott, launched a coup attempt against the then party leader, Nick Clegg – but the plot struggled for momentum and quickly collapsed with Cable uncontactable.\n\n“I wasn’t part of this plot. It all broke in the middle of the night in China and not surprisingly we were not rushing to the phone,” Cable said.",

    "fullText": "The AI trade is on fire on Wednesday.\n\nEarnings from international chip makers have sparked a fresh rally in US tech stocks, helping to power the market to fresh records.\n\nThe S&P 500 blew past 7,000 for the first time, a key psychological threshold that the market has flirted with lately but never cleared until now. The Nasdaq 100 also hit a record.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Wednesday:\n\nThe rally largely advanced on good news in the chips and semiconductors space.\n\nNvidia was up more than 1% on a report from Reuters that China has given the green light for several large firms to purchase the company's H200 AI chips.\n\nInvestors were also encouraged by strong earnings from non-US semiconductor firms. ASML and SK Hynix surged after the semiconductor firms issued robust guidance for 2026, which sent other chip and semiconductor stocks up across the board.\n\nHere were the notable moves in tech:\n\nMega-cap tech earnings were also helping boost sentiment, with investors waiting on results for Tesla, Meta, and Microsoft, three companies at the heart of the AI boom, after the close. Results for Apple are expected on Thursday.\n\nThe broader market churned higher as the investors looked ahead to the Fed's January rate decision. While markets are not expecting a rate-cut, investors seem to believe that strong earnings will help drive the next leg of the bull market, according to José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\n\n\"The risk-on attitude on Wall Street, amid a lack of hesitation to lift exposures, is emblematic of participants believing that the prints will deliver beats and raises overall, pointing to an extended runway ahead for AI,\" he wrote in a note.\n\n\"US stock indexes futures began Wednesday in bullish form. Wall Street loves a milestone, so there will be caps in the air if the S&P can maintain the 7,000 level it passed this morning,\" David Morrison, a senior market analyst at Trade Nation, wrote in a note to clients.",

    "fullText": "Beijing’s AI policy is focused on real-life applications but Chinese companies are beginning to articulate their own grand visions\n\nStanding on stage in the eastern China tech hub of Hangzhou, Alibaba’s normally media-shy CEO made an attention-grabbing announcement. “The world today is witnessing the dawn of an AI-driven intelligent revolution,” Eddie Wu told a developer conference in September. “Artificial general intelligence (AGI) will not only amplify human intelligence but also unlock human potential, paving the way for the arrival of artificial superintelligence (ASI).”\n\nASI, Wu said, “could produce a generation of ‘super scientists’ and ‘full-stack super engineers’”, who would “tackle unsolved scientific and engineering problems at unimaginable speeds”.\n\nWu also announced plans to invest 380bn yuan (£40bn) in AI infrastructure over the next three years, news that sent Alibaba stocks soaring to their highest in nearly four years.\n\nWu’s foray into the existential, techno-frontier rhetoric normally deployed by western tech CEOs such as OpenAI’s Sam Altman and DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis caught the attention of observers. “Wu’s ASI speech represents a breakthrough,” the tech writer Afra Wang wrote in her China AI newsletter, Concurrent. “Major Chinese companies are beginning to articulate their own grand visions that carry the flavour of future prophecy.”\n\nAGI, a theoretical state of AI where a highly autonomous system is able to do a human’s job, has become the preoccupation of American tech companies such as OpenAI and DeepMind. Many see it as the next frontier of civilisation, and are in competition with each other, and China, to get there. In May, the president of Microsoft, Brad Smith, told a US Senate committee on AI that the “race between the United States and China for international influence likely will be won by the fastest first mover”.\n\nMany in Washington have internalised these fears. The US-China economic and scurity review commission has recommended that Congress “establish and fund a Manhattan Project-like program dedicated to racing to and acquiring an artificial general intelligence (AGI) capability”. The Manhattan Project was a second world war-era research operation to produce nuclear weapons.\n\nIn China, many saw Wu’s speech as articulating the vision of a bold, singular tech company, but not one that represented China’s overall AI industry.\n\n“China certainly has research groups working towards AGI. But most AI companies are working towards better applications,” said Ya-Qin Zhang, the dean of Tsinghua University’s Institute for AI Industry Research and former president of the tech company Baidu.\n\nA combination of limited computing power, a pragmatic approach to technology and a keen awareness of the present day potential of AI has steered China’s national AI policy towards real-life applications rather than frontier research.\n\nIn August, the Chinese government published its highly anticipated “AI+ strategy”. The policy document outlined how AI could turbocharge China’s development goals, such as by using AI to improve medical diagnoses and make supply chains more efficient. But it made no mention of AGI.\n\n“The Chinese government is intently focused on reaping the benefits of AI in the here and now and in the near future through diffusion and application of AI across the economy, society, defence, and other areas,” said Julian Gewirtz, a former senior director for China and Taiwan at the White House national security council. “Despite its goal to ‘catch up and surpass’ the United States, we shouldn’t assume that the Chinese Communist party has bought into the idea that AGI is imminent.”\n\n“If you’re just looking at what has been officially published … there is no clear acknowledgment of AGI at all,” said Selina Xu, a China tech analyst. Xu noted that Xi Jinping, China’s leader, had a history of preferring the physical economy to more intangible forces.\n\n“It’s a very different narrative from the AGI race as a lot of people in DC see it,” Xu said.\n\nOne of the biggest factors guiding this strategy is the fact that US sanctions have prevented Chinese companies from acquiring the world’s most sophisticated semiconductors, which are needed for advanced AI research.\n\nWashington has banned the sale of hi-tech microchips to China in an effort to rein in the country’s AI development. Nvidia, the world’s leading chipmaker, then developed more basic semiconductors specifically for the Chinese market. In December, Washington approved the Nvidia’s second-most advanced chips, the H200s, for sale in China. But Beijing has reportedly told custom agents that the chips cannot be imported into China, as the government seeks to break the country’s reliance on overseas technology.\n\nChina insists that “necessity is the mother of invention” and points to the success of companies such as DeepSeek as proof that the US restrictions will merely spur innovation. DeepSeek’s founder, Liang Wenfeng, is one of the few Chinese tech leaders who, like Alibaba’s Wu, has openly expressed an interest in AGI.\n\nBut until China is able to produce its own advanced semiconductors at scale, most tech companies feel it is more profitable to use the hardware they already have to focus on AI applications rather than AGI.\n\nAnother factor guiding the US-China tech competition is the availability of datacentres and the energy to power them. In November, Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, said China would “win the AI race” in part because of its energy subsidies for datacentres.\n\nThe subsidies were reportedly introduced after Chinese tech companies complained of higher electricity bills caused by the domestic semiconductors they are obliged to use, which are less efficient than Nvidia’s. In a sign of how determined China is to break its reliance on imported technology, Reuters reported that any datacentres in receipt of state funds could only use domestic chips.\n\nSuch measures would reduce Nvidia’s competitive advantage in China and boost domestic chip producers, such as Huawei.\n\nSince 2021, China has reportedly poured $100bn into support for AI datacentres.\n\nBut there are signs that the boom may have been overzealous. A recent report from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology said that nationwide, the utilisation rate for AI datacentres was 32%.\n\nIn a recent op-ed in China Economic Weekly, Rao Shaoyang, the director at the China Telecom Research Institute, wrote that in some regions of China, the computing power industry was operating in a similar fashion to China’s beleaguered property sector: build first, find buyers later. He cautioned against “blindly building intelligent computing centres” and said local computing power demand should be considered before building new datacentres.\n\nDespite the surplus in more general computing power, many experts believe China still does not have chips that are sophisticated enough to explore frontier research in AGI. But analysts note that the mood could change quickly.\n\n“The current status quo is highly fluid, and Xi Jinping has explicitly declared an ambition to lead the world in AI,” said Gewirtz. “So the fact that China construes that goal one way at this snapshot moment in time does not give me any comfort that in a year they’re going to construe it the same way.”\n\nAdditional research by Lillian Yang",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Marco Rubio gave a full-throated defense Wednesday of President Donald Trump's military operation to oust and arrest then-Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, while also using his wide-ranging congressional testimony to touch on Greenland, NATO, Iran and China.\n\nAs Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee offered starkly different readings of the administration's foreign policy, Rubio addressed Trump's intentions and his often bellicose rhetoric that have alarmed U.S. allies in Europe and elsewhere.\n\nIn the first public hearing since the Jan. 3 intervention to depose Maduro, Rubio said Trump had acted to take out a major U.S. national security threat in the Western Hemisphere. Trump's top diplomat said America was safer and more secure as a result and that the Republican administration would work with interim authorities to stabilize the South American country.\n\n“We’re not going to have this thing turn around overnight, but I think we’re making good and decent progress,” Rubio said. “We are certainly better off today in Venezuela than we were four weeks ago and I think and hope and expect that we’ll be better off in three months and six months and nine months than we would have been had Maduro still been there.\"\n\nThe former Florida senator said that Venezuela's current leaders are cooperating and would soon begin to see benefits. But he backed away from remarks prepared for the hearing that Washington would not hesitate to take further military action should those leaders not fully accept Trump's demands.\n\n“I can tell you right now with full certainty, we are not postured to nor do we intend or expect to have to take any military action in Venezuela at any time,\" Rubio said. “I think it would require the emergence of an imminent threat of the kind that we do not anticipate at this time.”\n\nHe said Venezuela soon will be allowed to sell oil that is now subject to U.S. sanctions. The revenue would be set aside to pay for basic government services such as policing and health care. Oil sale money will be deposited in a U.S. Treasury-controlled account and released after the U.S. approves monthly budgets to be submitted by Venezuela, he said.\n\nPushback against skepticism from Democrats\n\nRepublican senators, with few exceptions, praised the Venezuelan operation. Among Democrats, there was deep skepticism.\n\nThey questioned Trump's policies in Venezuela and their potential for encouraging moves by China against Taiwan and Russia even more so in Ukraine, as well as his threats to take Greenland from NATO ally Denmark and his insults about the alliance's contributions to U.S. security.\n\nHe said the uproar over Greenland within NATO is calming and that talks are underway about how to deal with Trump's demands. The Republican president insists the U.S. needs Greenland to counter threats from Russia and China, but he recently backed away from a pledge to impose tariffs on several European countries that sent troops to the semiautonomous Danish territory in a show of solidarity.\n\n“I think we’re going to get something positive done,\" Rubio said.\n\nRubio dismissed criticism that Trump was undermining the alliance, while repeating the long-running American complaint that member nations need to boost their defense budgets.\n\n“NATO needs to be reimagined.” Rubio said. “I just think this president complains about it louder than other presidents.\"\n\nHe said China's stated goal to reunify Taiwan with the mainland would not be affected by any other world event, including the Maduro operation.\n\n“The situation on Taiwan is a legacy project\" that Chinese President Xi Jinping has made \"very clear that that’s what he intends to do and that’s going to be irrespective anything that happens in the world,” Rubio said.\n\nAs Trump once more threatens Iran with military action, Rubio said there was no current plan to attack. Asked about the potential for a change of government in Tehran, Rubio said that would require “a lot of careful thinking” because it would be “far more complex” than ousting Maduro.\n\nMore details about the raid in Caracas\n\nThe committee chairman, Idaho Sen. Jim Risch, praised Trump’s decisions to remove Maduro, continue deadly military strikes on boats suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean and seize sanctioned tankers.\n\nRisch also offered new details on the operation in the Venezuelan capital, saying it involved “only about 200 troops” and a “firefight that lasted less than 27 minutes.”\n\n“This military action was incredibly brief, targeted and successful,” Risch said, adding that the U.S. and other nations may have to assist Venezuela when it seeks to restore democratic elections. ”Venezuela may require U.S. and international oversight to ensure these elections are indeed free and fair,” he said.\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the committee's top Democrat, questioned whether that operation was worth it, considering most of Maduro's top aides and lieutenants still run the Venezuela and the economic situation there remains bleak.\n\n\"We’ve traded one dictator for another, so it’s no wonder that so many of my constituents are asking, why is the president spending so much time focused on Venezuela instead of the cost of living and their kitchen table economic concerns?\" she asked. “From Venezuela to Europe, the United States is spending more, risking more and achieving less.”\n\nCongress hasn't curtailed Trump on Venezuela\n\nCongressional Democrats have condemned Trump’s moves as exceeding the authority of the executive branch, while most Republicans have supported them as a legitimate exercise of presidential power.\n\nThe GOP-led House narrowly defeated a war powers act resolution that would have directed Trump to remove U.S. troops from Venezuela. As Rubio argued, the administration says there are no U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela despite a large military buildup in the region.\n\nDemocrats contended the resolution was necessary after the U.S. raid to capture Maduro and because Trump has stated plans to control the country’s oil industry for years to come.\n\nFamilies of two Trinidadian nationals killed in an administration boat strike filed what is thought to be the first wrongful-death case arising from that campaign. Three dozen strikes on boats in the region have killed at least 126 people since September.\n\nUS acts to normalize ties while issuing warnings\n\nWhile keeping pressure on those the U.S. calls “narcotraffickers” without providing evidence, officials also are working to normalize ties with Venezuela's acting president, Delcy Rodríguez.\n\nThe administration has said its demands for Rodriguez include opening Venezuela’s energy sector to U.S. companies, providing preferential access to production, using oil revenue to purchase American goods, and ending subsidized oil exports to Cuba.\n\nRodríguez, who was Maduro's vice president, said Tuesday that her government and the U.S. “have established respectful and courteous channels of communication.” And so far, she has appeared to acquiesce to Trump’s demands and to release prisoners jailed by the government under Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez.\n\nIn a key step to the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the State Department notified Congress this week that it intends to begin sending additional diplomatic and support personnel to Caracas to prepare for the possible reopening of the U.S. Embassy, which shuttered in 2019. Fully normalizing ties, however, would require the U.S. to revoke its decision recognizing the Venezuelan parliament elected in 2015 as the country’s legitimate government.\n\nLater Wednesday, Rubio was to meet Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado at the State Department.",

    "fullText": "Jan 28 (Reuters) - China has approved its first batch of Nvidia's H200 artificial intelligence chips for import, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, marking a shift in position as China ​seeks to balance its AI needs against spurring domestic development.\n\nThe approval covers several hundred thousand H200 chips ‌and was granted during Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang's visit to China this week, the sources said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity ‌of the matter.\n\nThe first batch of approvals has been allocated primarily to three major Chinese internet companies, with other enterprises now joining a queue for subsequent approvals, one of the sources said.\n\nThey declined to name the companies that received the initial clearances.\n\nChina's industry and commerce ministries as well as Nvidia had not yet responded to requests for comment at the time ⁠of publication.\n\nThe H200, Nvidia's second most ‌powerful AI chip, has emerged as a major flashpoint in U.S.-China relations. Despite strong demand from Chinese firms and U.S. approval for exports, Beijing's hesitation to allow imports has been ‍the main barrier to shipments.\n\nThe U.S. earlier this month formally cleared the way for Nvidia to sell the H200 to China, where the company is seeing strong appetite. However, Chinese authorities have the final say on whether they would allow it to be ​shipped in.\n\nIt was unclear in recent weeks whether Beijing would grant approval as the government wants to balance ‌meeting surging domestic demand for advanced AI chips and nurturing its domestic semiconductor industry.\n\nChinese customs authorities told agents that the H200 chips were not permitted to enter China, Reuters reported earlier this month.\n\nBut Chinese technology firms have placed orders for more than two million H200 chips, far exceeding Nvidia's available inventory, Reuters reported last month.\n\nIt remains uncertain how many additional companies will receive approval in subsequent batches or what criteria Beijing is using to determine eligibility.\n\nHuang arrived ⁠in Shanghai last Friday for routine annual celebrations with Nvidia's China ​employees and has since travelled to Beijing and other cities, Reuters ​reported last week.\n\nThe approvals of H200 suggest Beijing is prioritising the needs of major Chinese internet companies, which are spending billions of dollars to build data centres needed to develop AI ‍services and compete with U.S. ⁠rivals, including OpenAI.\n\nWhile Chinese companies such as Huawei now have products that rival the performance of Nvidia's H20 chip, previously the most advanced AI chip it was allowed to sell to China, they still ⁠lag far behind the H200.",

    "fullText": "Silver is making a major run higher amid tightening export controls in China and meme-stock-style buying by Main Street investors hoping to squeeze bearish bets.\n\nThe precious metal is up an eye-popping 249% over the past year, including a 47% year-to-date jump, but not everyone thinks silver prices are destined to keep climbing.\n\n2021: -11.55%\n\nFormer JPMorgan strategist Marko Kolanovic and famous Wall Street trader Peter Brandt both sounded alarms on silver in separate posts on X (the former Twitter) this week.\n\nThe stakes are high for investors, given that silver has gone parabolic, surging in a straight line, sparking animal spirits among those hoping to reap even bigger gains.\n\nNew buyers, however, should remember that precious metals are notorious for boom-and-bust moves, making new positions riskier now than they were months ago.\n\nOn Jan. 1, China designated silver as a strategic resource, alongside rare earth minerals. The move restricts silver exports, requiring licenses that have become harder to get. Only 44 companies qualified for silver export licenses as China seeks to guarantee supply for next-gen solar, EVs, and electronics technologies.\n\nThe move accelerated a rally that emerged last year, driven by bullishness over industrial demand for high-tech applications and, more generally, by rising interest among investors eager to diversify portfolios by owning silver ETFs, such as the iShares Silver Trust (SLV), or physical silver, such as coins and bars.\n\nThe numbers are truly massive. Silver's move has lifted the market's size above $6 trillion. Putting that figure into perspective, Nvidia, Apple, and Alphabet boast market caps of $4.5 trillion, $3.75 trillion, and $4 trillion, respectively.\n\nMarket uncertainty resets silver, gold bets\n\nBillionaire Dalio sends 2-word warning on markets\n\nEvery major analyst’s gold price forecast for 2026\n\nEveryone wants in on the action.\n\nOn January 26, the iShares Silver Trust exchange-traded fund saw turnover of nearly $40 billion, according to Bloomberg, a figure similar to that of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), the go-to ETF for the 500 most influential publicly traded companies. That's nearly 20x higher than it had been averaging for most of last year.\n\nMoves like this aren't common, and they're often warning shots to which investors ought to pay attention. I've been tracking markets for more than 30 years, and I've seen more than my fair share of jaw-dropping pops that eventually turned into drops.",

    "fullText": "A snow leopard in China recently mauled a tourist who tried to get close enough to snap a photo of the rare animal.\n\nChina’s Forestry and Grassland Bureau said the tourist, who is a skier, was bitten on Friday, Jan. 23, in Koktokay town in China’s Xinjiang region, while returning to her hotel, CNN reported.\n\n“The general public and tourists are urged to strictly abide by the safety guidelines, maintain a safe distance when encountering wild animals, and report to the police immediately to ensure personal safety,” the forestry bureau said.\n\nMore animal attacks: An 'attack squirrel' has injured multiple people in California\n\nChinese broadcaster CCTV said the tourist spotted the snow leopard, got out of her car, and approached it to try to take photos before being attacked. According to CNN, the tourist was taken to a local hospital, where she remains in stable condition.\n\nVideo obtained by USA TODAY shows the chaotic moments following the tourists' mauling. In some clips, the snow leopard is seen standing over the mauled woman. After the snow leopard leaves the scene, fellow tourists appear to help the injured skier walk away.\n\nSnow leopards are among the most elusive creatures in the wild and have been afforded “first-class protection” in China after suffering from poaching, habitat loss and the effects of climate change throughout South and Central Asia, according to the Chinese magazine Sixth Tone.\n\nAccording to the Snow Leopard Trust, there are between 3,900 and 6,400 snow leopards left in the world, spread out in a range of 2 million square kilometers. The animals are usually solitary and highly active; however, they are not known to be aggressive to humans.\n\nTheir thick white-gray coat blends into its surroundings as these leopards live on high and rocky mountains, the Snow Leopard Trust said.\n\nFernando Cervantes Jr. is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

    "fullText": "MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippines told China on Monday that it is alarmed about heated exchanges with Chinese diplomats in Manila over the long-standing, seething territorial dispute between the two countries in the South China Sea.\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila said without elaborating that it “made firm representations to the Chinese ambassador and the Chinese Embassy conveying serious concerns with the escalation of public exchanges.\"\n\nIt warned that the bruising, tit-for-tat exchanges with China could “unnecessarily derail the diplomatic space needed to manage the tensions in the maritime domain,\" but, nevertheless, expressed support to Philippine officials, including some senators, who have defended their country's territorial interests in the South China Sea.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing last week said it summoned Philippine Ambassador Jaime FlorCruz to protest remarks by Philippine coast guard spokesperson Commodore Jay Tarriela, one of the most vocal critics of China’s increasingly assertive actions in the disputed waters.\n\nChina has claimed virtually the entire waterway, a key global trade route, despite a 2016 arbitration ruling that invalidated Beijing’s expansive claims based on the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea. Beijing did not participate in the arbitration, which was initiated by the Philippines in 2013 after a territorial confrontation, and continues to defy the decision.\n\nVietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have been involved in the territorial standoffs.\n\nConfrontations in the high seas have particularly spiked in recent years between China and the Philippines. Unlike other claimants, the Philippine government has openly condemned China’s growing assertive actions in the disputed waters and publicized videos and pictures of the use of powerful water cannons and dangerous blocking maneuvers by China’s forces.\n\n“We reiterate our previous statements affirming support for our officials to perform their lawful duties in defense of Philippine sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction,” the Foreign Affairs department in Manila said. “Their views, as well as those of disagreeing voices, are an inescapable part of the robust plurality of ideas that animate our democratic society.\"\n\nThe Chinese Embassy has protested remarks by Tarriela, who it said has “persistently hyped up maritime issues, confounded right and wrong, misrepresented facts, incited confrontation, misled public opinion, undermined China’s national interests and dignity, impacted mutual trust.”\n\n“I firmly reject your ignorant and arrogant views,” Chinese Embassy deputy spokesperson Guo Wei said of Tarriela in a recent statement.\n\nTarriela responded by chiding Guo Wei in a social media post.\n\n“I am beginning to think you are enjoying to use the social media platforms here in the Philippines because you do not have such freedom in your country,\" he wrote.\n\nPhilippine Sen. Risa Hontiveros said in a speech Monday that Chinese diplomats have violated the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations when they publicly censured and tried to restrain Filipino officials’ views and criticisms in their own country.\n\nHontiveros also has called the Chinese Embassy “a bad guest” in the Philippines.\n\nIn a criticism of Hontiveros, the Chinese diplomatic mission in Manila recently said it has no intention of silencing anybody in the country, but it would respond to any attempt to “smear” China and its leaders.\n\n“Are you really advocating the interest of the Philippines and the Filipinos? Or are you simply pursuing your own political gains?” the Chinese Embassy asked Hontiveros, who has been seen as a possible contender in the 2028 presidential and vice presidential elections.",

The closure of the U.S. Agency for International Development last year and a drop in ⁠allocations from other developed countries has already hit ​developing economies, especially in Africa.\n\nOnce 2025 data becomes ​available, it is likely to show a large drop in Official Development Assistance flows, said McNair.\n\nHe said the trend was \"a net negative\" for ‍African nations, as many ⁠governments face difficulties funding public services and investment - but would at the same time promote domestic accountability as governments rely less on external financing.\n\nThe ⁠report also highlighted a broader decline in bilateral finance flows and private external debt - also trends likely ‌to be exacerbated by aid cuts from 2025 onwards.\n\n(Reporting Colleen Goko; ‌editing by Karin Strohecker and Kevin Liffey)",

    "title": "One developer used Claude to build a memory-safe extension of C",
    "description": "feature: Robin Rowe talks about coding, programming education, and China in the age of AI",
    "fullText": "feature TrapC, a memory-safe version of the C programming language, is almost ready for testing.\n\n\"We're almost there,\" Robin Rowe told The Register in a phone interview. \"It almost works.\"\n\nWe caught up with Rowe, a computer science professor and entrepreneur, amid debugging efforts that had kept him up until four in the morning. The long-awaited TrapC website has appeared.\n\n\"My work building TrapC has taken two parallel paths,\" Rowe explains in his initial post. \"A TrapC interpreter called itrapc and a separate compiler called trapc. I had wanted to make a software release by 1 January 2026, but too many bugs. I only reached code complete this month and am now on the painstaking and sleepless process of debugging. When I have something stable that mostly works I will make a release. Sorry to make you wait a little longer. Aiming for Q1 2026.\"\n\nBack in November 2024, Rowe explained that he was working on TrapC. At the time, the public and private sector had undertaken a campaign to promote memory-safe software development as a way to reduce exposure to serious vulnerabilities.\n\nMemory safety provides a way of ensuring that memory-related bugs like out-of-bounds reads/writes and use-after-free don't happen. In large codebases, like Chromium and Windows, most of the security vulnerabilities follow from memory bugs. As that message has been repeated in recent years, memory safety has become an imperative, evangelized by the likes of Google and Microsoft, and more recently by authorities in the US and elsewhere.\n\nFor at least the past ten years, there's been a rising chorus of voices calling for the adoption of memory-safe programming languages and techniques. This has meant encouraging developers to avoid languages like C and C++ where feasible, and to adopt languages like C#, Go, Java, Python, Swift, and Rust, instead, particularly for new projects.\n\nTo remain relevant, the C and C++ communities have tried to address those concerns with projects like TrapC, FilC, Mini-C, Safe C++, and C++ Profiles. There's also a C to Rust conversion project under development at DARPA called TRACTOR – TRanslating All C TO Rust.\n\nBut progress has been slow and those writing in C and C++ haven't found a widely accepted approach. The C++ standards committee recently rejected the Safe C++ proposal. And Rowe said he doubted TRACTOR would have anything to show this year.\n\nMeanwhile, the clock is ticking. Microsoft engineer Galen Hunt last month said, \"My goal is to eliminate every line of C and C++ from Microsoft by 2030. Our strategy is to combine AI and algorithms to rewrite Microsoft's largest codebases.\"\n\n\"There are some efforts to port C code by hand to Rust,\" said Rowe. \"But there're some real challenges to doing that because there are some idioms in C that cannot be expressed in Rust.\n\n\"Rust is much more type safe than C is. And so if you have a void pointer, what does that mean in Rust? There's no translation for it. And that's how TrapC is fundamentally different because it actually remembers what that void pointer actually is.\"\n\nRowe said he expects TRACTOR will eventually be able to accomplish C to Rust translation using AI. But he said he thinks it's better to just build the necessary tooling into the C compiler, so you don't have to rely on some external tool that rewrites your code in an unfamiliar language.\n\nRowe has been using AI tools himself and has been teaching others to do so. This past semester, he taught AI Cybersecurity Programmer Analyst (PCO471) at Community College of Baltimore County – Linux administration using vibe coding in bash with no prerequisites. And starting in February, he's teaching C++ Programming with Generative AI (PCO472) – vibe coding in C++.\n\nRowe said programming has fundamentally changed as a result of AI tools. \"I think this is sort of the same type of discussion as when C came in and people said, 'Well, I'm happy in assembly.' There will still be people doing it the old way. But because vibe programming is so much more efficient on time when done correctly, there's gonna be no choice. You just won't be competitive if you're not vibe programming.\"\n\nThen he shifted gears, slightly. \"But I have to walk that back a little bit because the reason I was up until four in the morning is I had vibe programming working on the Trap C compiler. And it took a fundamentally wrong design turn. And I didn't detect that it had made a design mistake. I had told it how I wanted to approach it. But somehow it misunderstood me or it forgot or something happened and I forgot to check. And so I spent hours doodling around in the debugger and trying to understand why code was acting weird before I finally looked at it and said, 'wait a minute, this isn't even the right design.'\"\n\nRowe said a similar situation crops up in pair programming, where you've told someone to do something and they didn't do it, and you don't realize that until later.\n\n\"[C++ creator] Bjarne Stroustrup famously said that the most important thing in software design is to be clear about what you're trying to build,\" Rowe said. \"And vibe [programming] just puts that on steroids. Now we not only have to be ourselves clear, but we have to communicate it clearly to an LLM.\"\n\nRowe argues that developers have to be encouraged to try AI tools and to make mistakes. He recounted how during his AI Cybersecurity Programmer Analyst course, his students expressed interest in doing more hands-on work in lieu of lectures.\n\n\"So I said, 'I've got real servers on the internet that are my companies. I'll give you root,'\" he recalled. \"I'll set loose students who know nothing on my own servers and hope for the best and we'll see how this goes. And the reaction was panic. I couldn't get past the timidity cliff.\"\n\nRowe said that what he learned from that exchange was that they didn't want their own hands-on, they wanted to watch him work.\n\n\"I said to them, 'But guys, this is like learning to play the piano. You can't learn to play the piano by watching me. Yeah, you guys have to practice. And it's gonna be embarrassing at first. You know, you're gonna play a lot of bad notes and sound terrible. You have to get over that situation'.\"\n\nThat's a scenario playing out in various companies where AI tools remain underutilized, for various reasons, including lack of training, security concerns, lack of utility, and poor tool design.\n\nRowe has traveled often to China to speak at the China Association of Higher Education conference. In December, he said, he was interviewed on China News Television about how China's plan for AI compares with America's.\n\nIn an email he explained, \"I said, 'China's AI-Plus plan calls for efficient AI on devices everywhere, from farm to factory to city, while the White House plan calls for building 500-billion-dollar cloud data centers ... using chips that will, inevitably, seem obsolete within two years.'\"\n\nRowe argues China's approach will prevail and that the US has taken the wrong turn by focusing on centralized cloud datacenters to run LLMs. Within two years, he said, we'll have AI models we can run locally on our phones, with no need for network access for most tasks. Apple and Huawei, he said, are likely to be the winners in this scenario.\n\nRowe pointed to China's DeepSeek as an example. While it may not be quite as good as the leading US commercial models, he said, it runs with far less power.\n\n\"This is a very Moore's Law type of strategy,\" he said. \"I remember when I had a Navy supercomputer in 1994. That was an amazing technology. But in 1995, Cray went bankrupt. There weren't enough buyers for it, even though it was an amazing device.\n\n\"And now I've got an iPhone that's in my pocket. That runs on a battery. It doesn't have a whole room devoted to it and exotic cooling and all kinds of stuff. And it's more powerful than that [the Cray from 1994]. So as a long-term strategy, you know, going toward the device makes a lot more sense, because that half-trillion dollar data center is going to be on my iPhone eventually.\"\n\nRowe also said that on the recommendation of a friend from his time at the AT&T DIRECTV Innovation Lab, he tried running Deepseek at a time when Claude wasn't available. Deepseek, he said, was able to find a bug that Claude couldn't.\n\n\"Surprisingly, the bug was in code Claude had generated, that I had cut-and-pasted carelessly,\" he said. \"With hindsight it was a silly code mistake I should have caught, but was in an 'else' branch outside where I was looking. I'd not expected or intended to have Claude make any change to that block of code. And because the code was valid but the logic wrong, the compiler didn't catch it.\"\n\nBut the bug was obvious, he said, as soon as Deepseek pointed it out. He added, \"I'm paying $200/year for Claude. Deepseek is free.\" ®",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Jan 27 (Reuters) - India and China cut emissions from electricity generation by accelerating clean energy deployment, researchers say, offsetting growing coal use in the U.S. and capping global ​growth in pollutants linked to climate change.\n\nPower sector emissions by China and India, the world's ‌top coal users who accounted for 93% of the rise in carbon dioxide discharges in the decade through 2024, declined simultaneously for the ‌first time in 52 years, according to a report by Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) this month.\n\n\"The fall in emissions in China and India in 2025 is a sign of things to come, as both countries added a record amount of new clean-power generation last year, which was more than sufficient to meet ⁠rising demand,\" said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst ‌at CREA, an independent research group registered in Finland.\n\nCHINA, INDIA POWER EMISSIONS FALL\n\nChina's power sector emissions fell by 40 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e), or 0.7% annually ‍in 2025, while discharges by Indian utilities declined 38 million tCO2e, or 4.1%, in the 11 months to the end of November, according to estimates from energy think-tank Ember compiled based on monthly government statistics.\n\nThat offset a 55.7 million metric tons ​of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) rise in annual U.S. emissions after an annual 13.1% increase in coal-fired power ‌output drove U.S. power plant emissions 3.3% higher in 2025, the fastest this century, the estimates showed, helping global emissions stay largely flat.\n\nPower plant emissions rose 3.4% in China and 4.4% in India annually on average over the 10 years to 2024, but fell 2.4% in the U.S. The three countries account for 60% of the world's power sector emissions, which make up about 35% of all polluting discharges linked to climate change.\n\nChina's ⁠coal use is set to decline gradually this decade, the ​International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its annual coal report in December, ​helping emissions from power generation plateau in the coming years.\n\nIn India, however, while record renewables additions and marginal growth in power demand helped New Delhi suppress coal use this ‍year, the IEA expects the ⁠country to continue depending on coal.\n\n\"Although coal-fired power generation declines in 2025, a moderate increase in coal consumption for power generation is nevertheless expected ... due to a steady rise in electricity demand,\" the ⁠IEA said.\n\nIn the U.S., the agency expects higher costs to reduce coal demand by 6% in the years until 2030 despite policy ‌incentives by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration and a slowdown in coal plant closures.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with John von Seggern, founder of Futureproof Music School. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn the 90s, the music scene in Asia was booming. I'm a bass player and jazz musician, and I was drawn to Japan in particular. Japanese people are known for being music lovers, and I enjoy their culture. It seemed like a good place to start a career.\n\nThere, I connected with a well-known artist in Hong Kong. I started touring Hong Kong and mainland China. After five big tours, I was tired. I've always loved studying, reading, and learning. I was dating a graduate student at the University of Hong Kong, and I thought that getting my master's degree would give me a much-needed break.\n\nI didn't need to pass any tests to get into the program; I just submitted a research proposal. My area of study — the intersection of music and the internet — was unique at the time, which I think helped me get in.\n\nThe University of Hong Kong follows a British model, which depends a lot on self-directed learning. I had a few small seminars during my roughly 18 months at the college, but most of my work was done on my own time. I'd meet with my advisor weekly, and then go off and do the reading and research he recommended.\n\nI received a fairly generous graduate school stipend in Hong Kong. It was enough to pay my rent and live on, and because of the relaxed time requirements, I could supplement my income by playing music gigs in the city.\n\nI was the only American in my program; most of the others were Chinese. There was a high regard for education in Hong Kong. Although it was unusual for a student to be in their 30s, people respected that I had returned to school.\n\nI did occasional work as a graduate assistant, and most of the undergrad students were Hong Kong natives. They were very disciplined and turned in top-quality work. Later, when I was a graduate assistant in the US, I was sad to see that my students' writing wasn't as strong as their Chinese counterparts.\n\nI really enjoyed being at the university, but I was getting concerned about the future of Hong Kong. The island was returned to China in 1997. During my travels, mainland China had always felt black and white, whereas Hong Kong was technicolor. Now, it felt that Hong Kong was beginning to fade. This was a big point of conversation among foreign faculty at the university.\n\nI decided to return to the US, just as lots of musicians settled in California. When I enrolled at the University of California, Riverside, I immediately noticed differences.\n\nTo begin with, the college didn't recognize most of the work I'd done in Hong Kong. I was able to bring my original research, but I didn't get credit for seminars, mostly because the British approach didn't equate easily with the American system.\n\nThe study in California was much more prescriptive, with required classes. At first, I didn't like that because I wanted to pursue my own intellectual interests. In hindsight, however, I was forced to learn a lot of fundamental knowledge that was beneficial.\n\nBeing in grad school in the US felt like a struggle to survive. I was expected to work more hours for a much smaller stipend — not even enough to cover rent. When I graded papers from undergrads, I was surprised when people handed in papers with obvious misspellings. It felt like a level of carelessness that I hadn't seen in Hong Kong.\n\nI wouldn't say that either China or the US was better for grad school; they were just two different approaches.\n\nUltimately, I'm glad I did both. The Hong Kong system was more personal, whereas the US system felt like boot camp, full of requirements I needed to meet.\n\nBoth experiences have benefited me in the years since. Although no one has ever asked me for my degree, the knowledge I gained in Hong Kong and Riverside has been really helpful.\n\nHave you attended college in both the US and China?
