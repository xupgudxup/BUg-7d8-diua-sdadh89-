    "fullText": "Chery has launched its first battery electric pickup in China under its Rely pickup brand, with pricing starting at 127,800 yuan, about $18,300, and running up to 158,800 yuan for higher trims. \n\nThe truck is positioned as a work-ready electric option with mainstream sizing, multiple drivetrains, and a tech-heavy cabin, arriving as new energy pickups become one of the fastest-growing niches in China.\n\nView the 3 images of this gallery on the original article\n\nEarly reports describe the Rely R08 EV as a body-on-frame pickup offered in six variants. Dimensions are listed at 5,330 mm long, 1,920 mm wide, and 1,890 mm tall, with a 3,230 mm wheelbase, putting it in the midsize-to-fullsize zone by global standards.\n\nPowertrain choices include a single-motor rear-wheel-drive model and a dual-motor all-wheel-drive model, with outputs cited at 150 kW for RWD and 300 kW for AWD. Range is reported at up to 510 km on the CLTC cycle depending on trim, which is the figure Chinese brands typically use for domestic marketing and it generally reads higher than EPA-style numbers.\n\nView the 2 images of this gallery on the original article\n\nThe R08 EV is also being pitched as modern inside, with reports citing an infotainment setup using a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8155 chip in some versions. Driver assistance is described as Level 2 capable depending on trim, with commonly listed features such as adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assistance, and automatic emergency braking. \n\nThis is the typical spec mix for value-focused Chinese EVs, where the headline is less about a single breakthrough feature and more about offering a complete equipment list at a low entry price.\n\nPickups are still a smaller segment in China than in North America, with 2025 pickup sales cited at about 589,000 units. What is changing quickly is electrification, with new energy pickup volume cited at roughly 73,000 units in 2025, up about 243 percent year over year, which helps explain why Chery is moving into the category now. \n\nA base price around $18,300 is part of that strategy, because it creates a lower barrier for buyers who want a truck shape for utility but have been priced out of many electric offerings. Chery’s wider EV messaging continues to lean into future battery narratives. It also fits a product portfolio that mixes mainstream launches with attention-grabbing ideas, and off-road EV projects.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Jan 29 (Reuters) - China's main space contractor vowed to develop space tourism in the next five years, state media reported on Thursday, as Beijing revs up its commercial spaceflight and deep space exploration ambitions ​amid a technology race with the U.S.\n\nState-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) said it would \"achieve the flight operation of ‌suborbital space tourism and gradually develop orbital space tourism,\" as well as \"build a gigawatt-level space digital intelligence infrastructure\", state broadcaster CCTV reported.\n\nChina and the U.S. are competing ‌as they look to turn space exploration into a commercially viable business similar to civil aviation, as well as becoming the first to exploit the military and strategic advantages of space dominance. CASC has vowed to transform China into a \"world-leading space power\" by 2045.\n\nBeijing's key bottleneck so far is its failure to complete a reusable rocket test. U.S. rival SpaceX's Falcon 9 reusable rocket has allowed its subsidiary Starlink to ⁠achieve a near-monopoly on low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites ‌and it is also used for orbital space tourism.\n\nReusability is crucial to lowering the costs of rocket launches and making it cheaper to send satellites into space. China achieved a record 93 space launches ‍last year, according to official announcements, buoyed by its rapidly maturing commercial spaceflight startups.\n\nHowever, China has repeatedly described SpaceX's monopoly on LEO satellites as a national security risk and is launching its own satellite constellations, which it hopes will number in the tens of thousands within the next decades.\n\nIn late ​December, Chinese entities submitted filings with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) laying out plans to put about 200,000 satellites in orbit over ‌the next 14 years. Two mega-constellations account for the vast majority, and the move would strategically reserve suborbital slots and frequencies for Beijing.\n\nCASC's plans were announced after China inaugurated its first School of Interstellar Navigation housed in the Chinese Academy of Sciences on Tuesday, aiming to foster the next generation of space talent in frontier fields including interstellar propulsion and deep space navigation.\n\nThe new institution signals China's ambitions to strategically transition from near-Earth orbit operations to deep space exploration, and will support China's planned lunar research station and efforts in ⁠detecting planets outside our solar system, according to a Xinhua report on ​the inauguration.\n\n\"The next 10 to 20 years will be a window for leapfrog ​development in China's interstellar navigation field. Original innovation in basic research and technological breakthroughs will reshape the pattern of deep space exploration,\" Xinhua wrote.\n\nThursday's CCTV report said CASC would also focus on breakthroughs in key technologies ‍such as small celestial resource exploration ⁠and intelligent independent mining and step up monitoring of space debris and the formulation of international space traffic management rules.\n\nChina's Chang'e-6 lunar probe was the first spacecraft to bring back samples from the far side of the moon in 2024, and ⁠Beijing is actively setting international standards for spaceflight and space infrastructure to establish itself as a dominant space power.\n\nThe U.S. faces intense competition this decade from ‌China in its effort to return astronauts to the moon, where no humans have gone since the final U.S. ‌Apollo mission in 1972.",

    "fullText": "Starmer’s team is wary of spies but such fears are not new – with Theresa May once warned to get dressed under a duvet\n\nWhen prime ministers travel to China, heightened security arrangements are a given – as is the quiet game of cat and mouse that takes place behind the scenes as each country tests out each other’s tradecraft and capabilities.\n\nKeir Starmer’s team has been issued with burner phones and fresh sim cards, and is using temporary email addresses, to prevent devices being loaded with spyware or UK government servers being hacked into.\n\nThe employment of such tactics may sound dramatic but they are par for the course in an age of digital espionage and information security. Burner phones, for example, are routinely used by No 10 on some trips abroad – at G20 the summits in Brazil in 2024 and South Africa in 2025, for example – though not on visits to allied nations or Five Eyes intelligence partners.\n\nFor visits to China these precautions have been standard for at least a decade, such is the expectation that Beijing will eavesdrop and monitor.\n\nWhen she was prime minister, Theresa May was warned ahead of her trip to Beijing in 2018 to get dressed under the duvet to ensure that spy cameras would not film her without any clothes on. It was advice that was passed on generally by officials to all those travelling on the trip eight years ago.\n\nConcerns about peeping tom surveillance are particularly relevant to those in the official entourage or business and press delegations staying in hotels. “There was a well-worn routine in places like Shenzhen that foreigners from the west would be assigned the same rooms so they wouldn’t have to move the equipment,” a former senior British intelligence official said. Those with time on their hands would try to find the concealed bugging devices for fun.\n\nWhen Gordon Brown visited China in 2008, an aide was victim of a honey trap. The male aide met a Chinese woman at a lively hotel disco in Shanghai and left with her. The next day, he reported that his BlackBerry phone was missing. He was reprimanded, though No 10 said there had been no security compromise.\n\nPart of the standard security guidance given to ministers and their aides reflects this incident. “The rest of the advice,” the senior security official said, “was warning middle-aged men that if an attractive young Chinese woman appeared interested in you, she probably wasn’t”.\n\nMichael Gove, writing in the Mail last year, recalled being given similar warnings before being dispatched on a ministerial trip in 2010: “I was also told that if anyone from the opposite sex who approached me was out of my league they had only one thing on their mind – and it wasn’t comparing notes on Confucian philosophy.”\n\nDavid Cameron visited Beijing as prime minister in December 2013. A former aide recalled that China insisted on supplying a personal protection officer “over six-and-a-half-foot tall” to follow the British prime minister and his team as closely as reasonably possible.\n\nThe practice, again, is relatively standard, but it offered an obvious possibility for low level information gathering. “At the end of the trip after pretending he couldn’t speak or understand, at the plane he said goodbye and safe travels in perfect English,” they recalled, presumably as a reminder they were being watched.\n\nGeneral guidance, according to one British official who visited Beijing, “is that everything is bugged” and the only area for sensitive or secret conversations and debriefs is the secure compartment in the British embassy.\n\nSimilar considerations apply when meeting Chinese leaders or officials – at international summits – or when visiting the country’s diplomatic premises in London or elsewhere.\n\nWhen James Cleverly was foreign secretary, a former adviser recalled that during the UN general assembly in New York, he and his team refused to take their mobiles into the Chinese consulate. The handsets were all stored in a lead-lined bag in the hands of officials who did not go inside the diplomatic building.\n\nOne of the consequences of this abundance of caution is that ministers are out of ordinary contact in China, meaning their families cannot easily get in contact, having instead to communicate via a private secretary or other close aide.\n\nIt can also cause other political issues, as happened to Vince Cable in 2014. The Lib Dem, who was then business secretary, was visiting China and did not have his mobile phone with him. Back in the UK, an old ally, Matthew Oakeshott, launched a coup attempt against the then party leader, Nick Clegg – but the plot struggled for momentum and quickly collapsed with Cable uncontactable.\n\n“I wasn’t part of this plot. It all broke in the middle of the night in China and not surprisingly we were not rushing to the phone,” Cable said.",

    "fullText": "Beijing’s AI policy is focused on real-life applications but Chinese companies are beginning to articulate their own grand visions\n\nStanding on stage in the eastern China tech hub of Hangzhou, Alibaba’s normally media-shy CEO made an attention-grabbing announcement. “The world today is witnessing the dawn of an AI-driven intelligent revolution,” Eddie Wu told a developer conference in September. “Artificial general intelligence (AGI) will not only amplify human intelligence but also unlock human potential, paving the way for the arrival of artificial superintelligence (ASI).”\n\nASI, Wu said, “could produce a generation of ‘super scientists’ and ‘full-stack super engineers’”, who would “tackle unsolved scientific and engineering problems at unimaginable speeds”.\n\nWu also announced plans to invest 380bn yuan (£40bn) in AI infrastructure over the next three years, news that sent Alibaba stocks soaring to their highest in nearly four years.\n\nWu’s foray into the existential, techno-frontier rhetoric normally deployed by western tech CEOs such as OpenAI’s Sam Altman and DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis caught the attention of observers. “Wu’s ASI speech represents a breakthrough,” the tech writer Afra Wang wrote in her China AI newsletter, Concurrent. “Major Chinese companies are beginning to articulate their own grand visions that carry the flavour of future prophecy.”\n\nAGI, a theoretical state of AI where a highly autonomous system is able to do a human’s job, has become the preoccupation of American tech companies such as OpenAI and DeepMind. Many see it as the next frontier of civilisation, and are in competition with each other, and China, to get there. In May, the president of Microsoft, Brad Smith, told a US Senate committee on AI that the “race between the United States and China for international influence likely will be won by the fastest first mover”.\n\nMany in Washington have internalised these fears. The US-China economic and scurity review commission has recommended that Congress “establish and fund a Manhattan Project-like program dedicated to racing to and acquiring an artificial general intelligence (AGI) capability”. The Manhattan Project was a second world war-era research operation to produce nuclear weapons.\n\nIn China, many saw Wu’s speech as articulating the vision of a bold, singular tech company, but not one that represented China’s overall AI industry.\n\n“China certainly has research groups working towards AGI. But most AI companies are working towards better applications,” said Ya-Qin Zhang, the dean of Tsinghua University’s Institute for AI Industry Research and former president of the tech company Baidu.\n\nA combination of limited computing power, a pragmatic approach to technology and a keen awareness of the present day potential of AI has steered China’s national AI policy towards real-life applications rather than frontier research.\n\nIn August, the Chinese government published its highly anticipated “AI+ strategy”. The policy document outlined how AI could turbocharge China’s development goals, such as by using AI to improve medical diagnoses and make supply chains more efficient. But it made no mention of AGI.\n\n“The Chinese government is intently focused on reaping the benefits of AI in the here and now and in the near future through diffusion and application of AI across the economy, society, defence, and other areas,” said Julian Gewirtz, a former senior director for China and Taiwan at the White House national security council. “Despite its goal to ‘catch up and surpass’ the United States, we shouldn’t assume that the Chinese Communist party has bought into the idea that AGI is imminent.”\n\n“If you’re just looking at what has been officially published … there is no clear acknowledgment of AGI at all,” said Selina Xu, a China tech analyst. Xu noted that Xi Jinping, China’s leader, had a history of preferring the physical economy to more intangible forces.\n\n“It’s a very different narrative from the AGI race as a lot of people in DC see it,” Xu said.\n\nOne of the biggest factors guiding this strategy is the fact that US sanctions have prevented Chinese companies from acquiring the world’s most sophisticated semiconductors, which are needed for advanced AI research.\n\nWashington has banned the sale of hi-tech microchips to China in an effort to rein in the country’s AI development. Nvidia, the world’s leading chipmaker, then developed more basic semiconductors specifically for the Chinese market. In December, Washington approved the Nvidia’s second-most advanced chips, the H200s, for sale in China. But Beijing has reportedly told custom agents that the chips cannot be imported into China, as the government seeks to break the country’s reliance on overseas technology.\n\nChina insists that “necessity is the mother of invention” and points to the success of companies such as DeepSeek as proof that the US restrictions will merely spur innovation. DeepSeek’s founder, Liang Wenfeng, is one of the few Chinese tech leaders who, like Alibaba’s Wu, has openly expressed an interest in AGI.\n\nBut until China is able to produce its own advanced semiconductors at scale, most tech companies feel it is more profitable to use the hardware they already have to focus on AI applications rather than AGI.\n\nAnother factor guiding the US-China tech competition is the availability of datacentres and the energy to power them. In November, Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, said China would “win the AI race” in part because of its energy subsidies for datacentres.\n\nThe subsidies were reportedly introduced after Chinese tech companies complained of higher electricity bills caused by the domestic semiconductors they are obliged to use, which are less efficient than Nvidia’s. In a sign of how determined China is to break its reliance on imported technology, Reuters reported that any datacentres in receipt of state funds could only use domestic chips.\n\nSuch measures would reduce Nvidia’s competitive advantage in China and boost domestic chip producers, such as Huawei.\n\nSince 2021, China has reportedly poured $100bn into support for AI datacentres.\n\nBut there are signs that the boom may have been overzealous. A recent report from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology said that nationwide, the utilisation rate for AI datacentres was 32%.\n\nIn a recent op-ed in China Economic Weekly, Rao Shaoyang, the director at the China Telecom Research Institute, wrote that in some regions of China, the computing power industry was operating in a similar fashion to China’s beleaguered property sector: build first, find buyers later. He cautioned against “blindly building intelligent computing centres” and said local computing power demand should be considered before building new datacentres.\n\nDespite the surplus in more general computing power, many experts believe China still does not have chips that are sophisticated enough to explore frontier research in AGI. But analysts note that the mood could change quickly.\n\n“The current status quo is highly fluid, and Xi Jinping has explicitly declared an ambition to lead the world in AI,” said Gewirtz. “So the fact that China construes that goal one way at this snapshot moment in time does not give me any comfort that in a year they’re going to construe it the same way.”\n\nAdditional research by Lillian Yang",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Marco Rubio gave a full-throated defense Wednesday of President Donald Trump's military operation to oust and arrest then-Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, while also using his wide-ranging congressional testimony to touch on Greenland, NATO, Iran and China.\n\nAs Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee offered starkly different readings of the administration's foreign policy, Rubio addressed Trump's intentions and his often bellicose rhetoric that have alarmed U.S. allies in Europe and elsewhere.\n\nIn the first public hearing since the Jan. 3 intervention to depose Maduro, Rubio said Trump had acted to take out a major U.S. national security threat in the Western Hemisphere. Trump's top diplomat said America was safer and more secure as a result and that the Republican administration would work with interim authorities to stabilize the South American country.\n\n“We’re not going to have this thing turn around overnight, but I think we’re making good and decent progress,” Rubio said. “We are certainly better off today in Venezuela than we were four weeks ago and I think and hope and expect that we’ll be better off in three months and six months and nine months than we would have been had Maduro still been there.\"\n\nThe former Florida senator said that Venezuela's current leaders are cooperating and would soon begin to see benefits. But he backed away from remarks prepared for the hearing that Washington would not hesitate to take further military action should those leaders not fully accept Trump's demands.\n\n“I can tell you right now with full certainty, we are not postured to nor do we intend or expect to have to take any military action in Venezuela at any time,\" Rubio said. “I think it would require the emergence of an imminent threat of the kind that we do not anticipate at this time.”\n\nHe said Venezuela soon will be allowed to sell oil that is now subject to U.S. sanctions. The revenue would be set aside to pay for basic government services such as policing and health care. Oil sale money will be deposited in a U.S. Treasury-controlled account and released after the U.S. approves monthly budgets to be submitted by Venezuela, he said.\n\nPushback against skepticism from Democrats\n\nRepublican senators, with few exceptions, praised the Venezuelan operation. Among Democrats, there was deep skepticism.\n\nThey questioned Trump's policies in Venezuela and their potential for encouraging moves by China against Taiwan and Russia even more so in Ukraine, as well as his threats to take Greenland from NATO ally Denmark and his insults about the alliance's contributions to U.S. security.\n\nHe said the uproar over Greenland within NATO is calming and that talks are underway about how to deal with Trump's demands. The Republican president insists the U.S. needs Greenland to counter threats from Russia and China, but he recently backed away from a pledge to impose tariffs on several European countries that sent troops to the semiautonomous Danish territory in a show of solidarity.\n\n“I think we’re going to get something positive done,\" Rubio said.\n\nRubio dismissed criticism that Trump was undermining the alliance, while repeating the long-running American complaint that member nations need to boost their defense budgets.\n\n“NATO needs to be reimagined.” Rubio said. “I just think this president complains about it louder than other presidents.\"\n\nHe said China's stated goal to reunify Taiwan with the mainland would not be affected by any other world event, including the Maduro operation.\n\n“The situation on Taiwan is a legacy project\" that Chinese President Xi Jinping has made \"very clear that that’s what he intends to do and that’s going to be irrespective anything that happens in the world,” Rubio said.\n\nAs Trump once more threatens Iran with military action, Rubio said there was no current plan to attack. Asked about the potential for a change of government in Tehran, Rubio said that would require “a lot of careful thinking” because it would be “far more complex” than ousting Maduro.\n\nMore details about the raid in Caracas\n\nThe committee chairman, Idaho Sen. Jim Risch, praised Trump’s decisions to remove Maduro, continue deadly military strikes on boats suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean and seize sanctioned tankers.\n\nRisch also offered new details on the operation in the Venezuelan capital, saying it involved “only about 200 troops” and a “firefight that lasted less than 27 minutes.”\n\n“This military action was incredibly brief, targeted and successful,” Risch said, adding that the U.S. and other nations may have to assist Venezuela when it seeks to restore democratic elections. ”Venezuela may require U.S. and international oversight to ensure these elections are indeed free and fair,” he said.\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the committee's top Democrat, questioned whether that operation was worth it, considering most of Maduro's top aides and lieutenants still run the Venezuela and the economic situation there remains bleak.\n\n\"We’ve traded one dictator for another, so it’s no wonder that so many of my constituents are asking, why is the president spending so much time focused on Venezuela instead of the cost of living and their kitchen table economic concerns?\" she asked. “From Venezuela to Europe, the United States is spending more, risking more and achieving less.”\n\nCongress hasn't curtailed Trump on Venezuela\n\nCongressional Democrats have condemned Trump’s moves as exceeding the authority of the executive branch, while most Republicans have supported them as a legitimate exercise of presidential power.\n\nThe GOP-led House narrowly defeated a war powers act resolution that would have directed Trump to remove U.S. troops from Venezuela. As Rubio argued, the administration says there are no U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela despite a large military buildup in the region.\n\nDemocrats contended the resolution was necessary after the U.S. raid to capture Maduro and because Trump has stated plans to control the country’s oil industry for years to come.\n\nFamilies of two Trinidadian nationals killed in an administration boat strike filed what is thought to be the first wrongful-death case arising from that campaign. Three dozen strikes on boats in the region have killed at least 126 people since September.\n\nUS acts to normalize ties while issuing warnings\n\nWhile keeping pressure on those the U.S. calls “narcotraffickers” without providing evidence, officials also are working to normalize ties with Venezuela's acting president, Delcy Rodríguez.\n\nThe administration has said its demands for Rodriguez include opening Venezuela’s energy sector to U.S. companies, providing preferential access to production, using oil revenue to purchase American goods, and ending subsidized oil exports to Cuba.\n\nRodríguez, who was Maduro's vice president, said Tuesday that her government and the U.S. “have established respectful and courteous channels of communication.” And so far, she has appeared to acquiesce to Trump’s demands and to release prisoners jailed by the government under Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez.\n\nIn a key step to the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the State Department notified Congress this week that it intends to begin sending additional diplomatic and support personnel to Caracas to prepare for the possible reopening of the U.S. Embassy, which shuttered in 2019. Fully normalizing ties, however, would require the U.S. to revoke its decision recognizing the Venezuelan parliament elected in 2015 as the country’s legitimate government.\n\nLater Wednesday, Rubio was to meet Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado at the State Department.",

    "fullText": "Jan 28 (Reuters) - China has approved its first batch of Nvidia's H200 artificial intelligence chips for import, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, marking a shift in position as China ​seeks to balance its AI needs against spurring domestic development.\n\nThe approval covers several hundred thousand H200 chips ‌and was granted during Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang's visit to China this week, the sources said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity ‌of the matter.\n\nThe first batch of approvals has been allocated primarily to three major Chinese internet companies, with other enterprises now joining a queue for subsequent approvals, one of the sources said.\n\nThey declined to name the companies that received the initial clearances.\n\nChina's industry and commerce ministries as well as Nvidia had not yet responded to requests for comment at the time ⁠of publication.\n\nThe H200, Nvidia's second most ‌powerful AI chip, has emerged as a major flashpoint in U.S.-China relations. Despite strong demand from Chinese firms and U.S. approval for exports, Beijing's hesitation to allow imports has been ‍the main barrier to shipments.\n\nThe U.S. earlier this month formally cleared the way for Nvidia to sell the H200 to China, where the company is seeing strong appetite. However, Chinese authorities have the final say on whether they would allow it to be ​shipped in.\n\nIt was unclear in recent weeks whether Beijing would grant approval as the government wants to balance ‌meeting surging domestic demand for advanced AI chips and nurturing its domestic semiconductor industry.\n\nChinese customs authorities told agents that the H200 chips were not permitted to enter China, Reuters reported earlier this month.\n\nBut Chinese technology firms have placed orders for more than two million H200 chips, far exceeding Nvidia's available inventory, Reuters reported last month.\n\nIt remains uncertain how many additional companies will receive approval in subsequent batches or what criteria Beijing is using to determine eligibility.\n\nHuang arrived ⁠in Shanghai last Friday for routine annual celebrations with Nvidia's China ​employees and has since travelled to Beijing and other cities, Reuters ​reported last week.\n\nThe approvals of H200 suggest Beijing is prioritising the needs of major Chinese internet companies, which are spending billions of dollars to build data centres needed to develop AI ‍services and compete with U.S. ⁠rivals, including OpenAI.\n\nWhile Chinese companies such as Huawei now have products that rival the performance of Nvidia's H20 chip, previously the most advanced AI chip it was allowed to sell to China, they still ⁠lag far behind the H200.",

    "fullText": "Silver is making a major run higher amid tightening export controls in China and meme-stock-style buying by Main Street investors hoping to squeeze bearish bets.\n\nThe precious metal is up an eye-popping 249% over the past year, including a 47% year-to-date jump, but not everyone thinks silver prices are destined to keep climbing.\n\n2021: -11.55%\n\nFormer JPMorgan strategist Marko Kolanovic and famous Wall Street trader Peter Brandt both sounded alarms on silver in separate posts on X (the former Twitter) this week.\n\nThe stakes are high for investors, given that silver has gone parabolic, surging in a straight line, sparking animal spirits among those hoping to reap even bigger gains.\n\nNew buyers, however, should remember that precious metals are notorious for boom-and-bust moves, making new positions riskier now than they were months ago.\n\nOn Jan. 1, China designated silver as a strategic resource, alongside rare earth minerals. The move restricts silver exports, requiring licenses that have become harder to get. Only 44 companies qualified for silver export licenses as China seeks to guarantee supply for next-gen solar, EVs, and electronics technologies.\n\nThe move accelerated a rally that emerged last year, driven by bullishness over industrial demand for high-tech applications and, more generally, by rising interest among investors eager to diversify portfolios by owning silver ETFs, such as the iShares Silver Trust (SLV), or physical silver, such as coins and bars.\n\nThe numbers are truly massive. Silver's move has lifted the market's size above $6 trillion. Putting that figure into perspective, Nvidia, Apple, and Alphabet boast market caps of $4.5 trillion, $3.75 trillion, and $4 trillion, respectively.\n\nMarket uncertainty resets silver, gold bets\n\nBillionaire Dalio sends 2-word warning on markets\n\nEvery major analyst’s gold price forecast for 2026\n\nEveryone wants in on the action.\n\nOn January 26, the iShares Silver Trust exchange-traded fund saw turnover of nearly $40 billion, according to Bloomberg, a figure similar to that of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), the go-to ETF for the 500 most influential publicly traded companies. That's nearly 20x higher than it had been averaging for most of last year.\n\nMoves like this aren't common, and they're often warning shots to which investors ought to pay attention. I've been tracking markets for more than 30 years, and I've seen more than my fair share of jaw-dropping pops that eventually turned into drops.",

    "fullText": "A snow leopard in China recently mauled a tourist who tried to get close enough to snap a photo of the rare animal.\n\nChina’s Forestry and Grassland Bureau said the tourist, who is a skier, was bitten on Friday, Jan. 23, in Koktokay town in China’s Xinjiang region, while returning to her hotel, CNN reported.\n\n“The general public and tourists are urged to strictly abide by the safety guidelines, maintain a safe distance when encountering wild animals, and report to the police immediately to ensure personal safety,” the forestry bureau said.\n\nMore animal attacks: An 'attack squirrel' has injured multiple people in California\n\nChinese broadcaster CCTV said the tourist spotted the snow leopard, got out of her car, and approached it to try to take photos before being attacked. According to CNN, the tourist was taken to a local hospital, where she remains in stable condition.\n\nVideo obtained by USA TODAY shows the chaotic moments following the tourists' mauling. In some clips, the snow leopard is seen standing over the mauled woman. After the snow leopard leaves the scene, fellow tourists appear to help the injured skier walk away.\n\nSnow leopards are among the most elusive creatures in the wild and have been afforded “first-class protection” in China after suffering from poaching, habitat loss and the effects of climate change throughout South and Central Asia, according to the Chinese magazine Sixth Tone.\n\nAccording to the Snow Leopard Trust, there are between 3,900 and 6,400 snow leopards left in the world, spread out in a range of 2 million square kilometers. The animals are usually solitary and highly active; however, they are not known to be aggressive to humans.\n\nTheir thick white-gray coat blends into its surroundings as these leopards live on high and rocky mountains, the Snow Leopard Trust said.\n\nFernando Cervantes Jr. is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

    "fullText": "MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippines told China on Monday that it is alarmed about heated exchanges with Chinese diplomats in Manila over the long-standing, seething territorial dispute between the two countries in the South China Sea.\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila said without elaborating that it “made firm representations to the Chinese ambassador and the Chinese Embassy conveying serious concerns with the escalation of public exchanges.\"\n\nIt warned that the bruising, tit-for-tat exchanges with China could “unnecessarily derail the diplomatic space needed to manage the tensions in the maritime domain,\" but, nevertheless, expressed support to Philippine officials, including some senators, who have defended their country's territorial interests in the South China Sea.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing last week said it summoned Philippine Ambassador Jaime FlorCruz to protest remarks by Philippine coast guard spokesperson Commodore Jay Tarriela, one of the most vocal critics of China’s increasingly assertive actions in the disputed waters.\n\nChina has claimed virtually the entire waterway, a key global trade route, despite a 2016 arbitration ruling that invalidated Beijing’s expansive claims based on the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea. Beijing did not participate in the arbitration, which was initiated by the Philippines in 2013 after a territorial confrontation, and continues to defy the decision.\n\nVietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have been involved in the territorial standoffs.\n\nConfrontations in the high seas have particularly spiked in recent years between China and the Philippines. Unlike other claimants, the Philippine government has openly condemned China’s growing assertive actions in the disputed waters and publicized videos and pictures of the use of powerful water cannons and dangerous blocking maneuvers by China’s forces.\n\n“We reiterate our previous statements affirming support for our officials to perform their lawful duties in defense of Philippine sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction,” the Foreign Affairs department in Manila said. “Their views, as well as those of disagreeing voices, are an inescapable part of the robust plurality of ideas that animate our democratic society.\"\n\nThe Chinese Embassy has protested remarks by Tarriela, who it said has “persistently hyped up maritime issues, confounded right and wrong, misrepresented facts, incited confrontation, misled public opinion, undermined China’s national interests and dignity, impacted mutual trust.”\n\n“I firmly reject your ignorant and arrogant views,” Chinese Embassy deputy spokesperson Guo Wei said of Tarriela in a recent statement.\n\nTarriela responded by chiding Guo Wei in a social media post.\n\n“I am beginning to think you are enjoying to use the social media platforms here in the Philippines because you do not have such freedom in your country,\" he wrote.\n\nPhilippine Sen. Risa Hontiveros said in a speech Monday that Chinese diplomats have violated the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations when they publicly censured and tried to restrain Filipino officials’ views and criticisms in their own country.\n\nHontiveros also has called the Chinese Embassy “a bad guest” in the Philippines.\n\nIn a criticism of Hontiveros, the Chinese diplomatic mission in Manila recently said it has no intention of silencing anybody in the country, but it would respond to any attempt to “smear” China and its leaders.\n\n“Are you really advocating the interest of the Philippines and the Filipinos? Or are you simply pursuing your own political gains?” the Chinese Embassy asked Hontiveros, who has been seen as a possible contender in the 2028 presidential and vice presidential elections.",

The closure of the U.S. Agency for International Development last year and a drop in ⁠allocations from other developed countries has already hit ​developing economies, especially in Africa.\n\nOnce 2025 data becomes ​available, it is likely to show a large drop in Official Development Assistance flows, said McNair.\n\nHe said the trend was \"a net negative\" for ‍African nations, as many ⁠governments face difficulties funding public services and investment - but would at the same time promote domestic accountability as governments rely less on external financing.\n\nThe ⁠report also highlighted a broader decline in bilateral finance flows and private external debt - also trends likely ‌to be exacerbated by aid cuts from 2025 onwards.\n\n(Reporting Colleen Goko; ‌editing by Karin Strohecker and Kevin Liffey)",

    "title": "One developer used Claude to build a memory-safe extension of C",
    "description": "feature: Robin Rowe talks about coding, programming education, and China in the age of AI",
    "fullText": "feature TrapC, a memory-safe version of the C programming language, is almost ready for testing.\n\n\"We're almost there,\" Robin Rowe told The Register in a phone interview. \"It almost works.\"\n\nWe caught up with Rowe, a computer science professor and entrepreneur, amid debugging efforts that had kept him up until four in the morning. The long-awaited TrapC website has appeared.\n\n\"My work building TrapC has taken two parallel paths,\" Rowe explains in his initial post. \"A TrapC interpreter called itrapc and a separate compiler called trapc. I had wanted to make a software release by 1 January 2026, but too many bugs. I only reached code complete this month and am now on the painstaking and sleepless process of debugging. When I have something stable that mostly works I will make a release. Sorry to make you wait a little longer. Aiming for Q1 2026.\"\n\nBack in November 2024, Rowe explained that he was working on TrapC. At the time, the public and private sector had undertaken a campaign to promote memory-safe software development as a way to reduce exposure to serious vulnerabilities.\n\nMemory safety provides a way of ensuring that memory-related bugs like out-of-bounds reads/writes and use-after-free don't happen. In large codebases, like Chromium and Windows, most of the security vulnerabilities follow from memory bugs. As that message has been repeated in recent years, memory safety has become an imperative, evangelized by the likes of Google and Microsoft, and more recently by authorities in the US and elsewhere.\n\nFor at least the past ten years, there's been a rising chorus of voices calling for the adoption of memory-safe programming languages and techniques. This has meant encouraging developers to avoid languages like C and C++ where feasible, and to adopt languages like C#, Go, Java, Python, Swift, and Rust, instead, particularly for new projects.\n\nTo remain relevant, the C and C++ communities have tried to address those concerns with projects like TrapC, FilC, Mini-C, Safe C++, and C++ Profiles. There's also a C to Rust conversion project under development at DARPA called TRACTOR – TRanslating All C TO Rust.\n\nBut progress has been slow and those writing in C and C++ haven't found a widely accepted approach. The C++ standards committee recently rejected the Safe C++ proposal. And Rowe said he doubted TRACTOR would have anything to show this year.\n\nMeanwhile, the clock is ticking. Microsoft engineer Galen Hunt last month said, \"My goal is to eliminate every line of C and C++ from Microsoft by 2030. Our strategy is to combine AI and algorithms to rewrite Microsoft's largest codebases.\"\n\n\"There are some efforts to port C code by hand to Rust,\" said Rowe. \"But there're some real challenges to doing that because there are some idioms in C that cannot be expressed in Rust.\n\n\"Rust is much more type safe than C is. And so if you have a void pointer, what does that mean in Rust? There's no translation for it. And that's how TrapC is fundamentally different because it actually remembers what that void pointer actually is.\"\n\nRowe said he expects TRACTOR will eventually be able to accomplish C to Rust translation using AI. But he said he thinks it's better to just build the necessary tooling into the C compiler, so you don't have to rely on some external tool that rewrites your code in an unfamiliar language.\n\nRowe has been using AI tools himself and has been teaching others to do so. This past semester, he taught AI Cybersecurity Programmer Analyst (PCO471) at Community College of Baltimore County – Linux administration using vibe coding in bash with no prerequisites. And starting in February, he's teaching C++ Programming with Generative AI (PCO472) – vibe coding in C++.\n\nRowe said programming has fundamentally changed as a result of AI tools. \"I think this is sort of the same type of discussion as when C came in and people said, 'Well, I'm happy in assembly.' There will still be people doing it the old way. But because vibe programming is so much more efficient on time when done correctly, there's gonna be no choice. You just won't be competitive if you're not vibe programming.\"\n\nThen he shifted gears, slightly. \"But I have to walk that back a little bit because the reason I was up until four in the morning is I had vibe programming working on the Trap C compiler. And it took a fundamentally wrong design turn. And I didn't detect that it had made a design mistake. I had told it how I wanted to approach it. But somehow it misunderstood me or it forgot or something happened and I forgot to check. And so I spent hours doodling around in the debugger and trying to understand why code was acting weird before I finally looked at it and said, 'wait a minute, this isn't even the right design.'\"\n\nRowe said a similar situation crops up in pair programming, where you've told someone to do something and they didn't do it, and you don't realize that until later.\n\n\"[C++ creator] Bjarne Stroustrup famously said that the most important thing in software design is to be clear about what you're trying to build,\" Rowe said. \"And vibe [programming] just puts that on steroids. Now we not only have to be ourselves clear, but we have to communicate it clearly to an LLM.\"\n\nRowe argues that developers have to be encouraged to try AI tools and to make mistakes. He recounted how during his AI Cybersecurity Programmer Analyst course, his students expressed interest in doing more hands-on work in lieu of lectures.\n\n\"So I said, 'I've got real servers on the internet that are my companies. I'll give you root,'\" he recalled. \"I'll set loose students who know nothing on my own servers and hope for the best and we'll see how this goes. And the reaction was panic. I couldn't get past the timidity cliff.\"\n\nRowe said that what he learned from that exchange was that they didn't want their own hands-on, they wanted to watch him work.\n\n\"I said to them, 'But guys, this is like learning to play the piano. You can't learn to play the piano by watching me. Yeah, you guys have to practice. And it's gonna be embarrassing at first. You know, you're gonna play a lot of bad notes and sound terrible. You have to get over that situation'.\"\n\nThat's a scenario playing out in various companies where AI tools remain underutilized, for various reasons, including lack of training, security concerns, lack of utility, and poor tool design.\n\nRowe has traveled often to China to speak at the China Association of Higher Education conference. In December, he said, he was interviewed on China News Television about how China's plan for AI compares with America's.\n\nIn an email he explained, \"I said, 'China's AI-Plus plan calls for efficient AI on devices everywhere, from farm to factory to city, while the White House plan calls for building 500-billion-dollar cloud data centers ... using chips that will, inevitably, seem obsolete within two years.'\"\n\nRowe argues China's approach will prevail and that the US has taken the wrong turn by focusing on centralized cloud datacenters to run LLMs. Within two years, he said, we'll have AI models we can run locally on our phones, with no need for network access for most tasks. Apple and Huawei, he said, are likely to be the winners in this scenario.\n\nRowe pointed to China's DeepSeek as an example. While it may not be quite as good as the leading US commercial models, he said, it runs with far less power.\n\n\"This is a very Moore's Law type of strategy,\" he said. \"I remember when I had a Navy supercomputer in 1994. That was an amazing technology. But in 1995, Cray went bankrupt. There weren't enough buyers for it, even though it was an amazing device.\n\n\"And now I've got an iPhone that's in my pocket. That runs on a battery. It doesn't have a whole room devoted to it and exotic cooling and all kinds of stuff. And it's more powerful than that [the Cray from 1994]. So as a long-term strategy, you know, going toward the device makes a lot more sense, because that half-trillion dollar data center is going to be on my iPhone eventually.\"\n\nRowe also said that on the recommendation of a friend from his time at the AT&T DIRECTV Innovation Lab, he tried running Deepseek at a time when Claude wasn't available. Deepseek, he said, was able to find a bug that Claude couldn't.\n\n\"Surprisingly, the bug was in code Claude had generated, that I had cut-and-pasted carelessly,\" he said. \"With hindsight it was a silly code mistake I should have caught, but was in an 'else' branch outside where I was looking. I'd not expected or intended to have Claude make any change to that block of code. And because the code was valid but the logic wrong, the compiler didn't catch it.\"\n\nBut the bug was obvious, he said, as soon as Deepseek pointed it out. He added, \"I'm paying $200/year for Claude. Deepseek is free.\" ®",

    "description": "I studied music in both Hong Kong and the US. In China, I did most of my work on my own time and didn't need to meet many requirements.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with John von Seggern, founder of Futureproof Music School. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn the 90s, the music scene in Asia was booming. I'm a bass player and jazz musician, and I was drawn to Japan in particular. Japanese people are known for being music lovers, and I enjoy their culture. It seemed like a good place to start a career.\n\nThere, I connected with a well-known artist in Hong Kong. I started touring Hong Kong and mainland China. After five big tours, I was tired. I've always loved studying, reading, and learning. I was dating a graduate student at the University of Hong Kong, and I thought that getting my master's degree would give me a much-needed break.\n\nI didn't need to pass any tests to get into the program; I just submitted a research proposal. My area of study — the intersection of music and the internet — was unique at the time, which I think helped me get in.\n\nThe University of Hong Kong follows a British model, which depends a lot on self-directed learning. I had a few small seminars during my roughly 18 months at the college, but most of my work was done on my own time. I'd meet with my advisor weekly, and then go off and do the reading and research he recommended.\n\nI received a fairly generous graduate school stipend in Hong Kong. It was enough to pay my rent and live on, and because of the relaxed time requirements, I could supplement my income by playing music gigs in the city.\n\nI was the only American in my program; most of the others were Chinese. There was a high regard for education in Hong Kong. Although it was unusual for a student to be in their 30s, people respected that I had returned to school.\n\nI did occasional work as a graduate assistant, and most of the undergrad students were Hong Kong natives. They were very disciplined and turned in top-quality work. Later, when I was a graduate assistant in the US, I was sad to see that my students' writing wasn't as strong as their Chinese counterparts.\n\nI really enjoyed being at the university, but I was getting concerned about the future of Hong Kong. The island was returned to China in 1997. During my travels, mainland China had always felt black and white, whereas Hong Kong was technicolor. Now, it felt that Hong Kong was beginning to fade. This was a big point of conversation among foreign faculty at the university.\n\nI decided to return to the US, just as lots of musicians settled in California. When I enrolled at the University of California, Riverside, I immediately noticed differences.\n\nTo begin with, the college didn't recognize most of the work I'd done in Hong Kong. I was able to bring my original research, but I didn't get credit for seminars, mostly because the British approach didn't equate easily with the American system.\n\nThe study in California was much more prescriptive, with required classes. At first, I didn't like that because I wanted to pursue my own intellectual interests. In hindsight, however, I was forced to learn a lot of fundamental knowledge that was beneficial.\n\nBeing in grad school in the US felt like a struggle to survive. I was expected to work more hours for a much smaller stipend — not even enough to cover rent. When I graded papers from undergrads, I was surprised when people handed in papers with obvious misspellings. It felt like a level of carelessness that I hadn't seen in Hong Kong.\n\nI wouldn't say that either China or the US was better for grad school; they were just two different approaches.\n\nUltimately, I'm glad I did both. The Hong Kong system was more personal, whereas the US system felt like boot camp, full of requirements I needed to meet.\n\nBoth experiences have benefited me in the years since. Although no one has ever asked me for my degree, the knowledge I gained in Hong Kong and Riverside has been really helpful.\n\nHave you attended college in both the US and China?

    "description": "For a long time the question has been asked: if China decides to invade Taiwan, can it be stopped by the US?",
    "fullText": "For a long time the question has been asked: if China decides to invade Taiwan, can it be stopped by the US?\n\nIn short, is the US still the world’s sole superpower, able to dictate terms to Beijing even just off the China coast – or can the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) now bring the long-standing “Pax Americana”, the rules-based international order, to a conclusive end?\n\nWe may find out quite soon now, even as Sir Keir Starmer travels to Beijing this week to break bread with Xi Jinping. Last week, away from the slopes of Davos and largely unnoticed outside the shipping industry, the geopolitical order shifted significantly. A bulk cargo ship named Winning Youth arrived in China carrying 200,000 tons of iron ore.\n\nBig cargoes of iron ore arrive in China all the time, of course, to feed the nation’s enormous appetite for primary steel. Normally, however, the ore comes from Australia (64pc) or Brazil (the other major supplier at 22pc).\n\nThe Winning Youth’s cargo was different. It was the first to be shipped from the enormous Simandou deposits in Guinea, West Africa. The ship departed from the Conakry anchorage on Dec 2.\n\nThe Simandou mines, the associated rail line to the coast, and the specially built barge port on the Morébaya river estuary from which the ore is loaded aboard ships in the anchorage, are a massive joint project.\n\nThis has complex finances, but according to analysis house Drewry: “Chinese entities collectively have the largest strategic influence across the entire project through both mine ownership and shared control of the rail-port infrastructure. China is the largest combined strategic stakeholder.”\n\nThe Simandou project is not yet properly online: it took three weeks to get the Winning Youth fully loaded, much longer than it will take to load a bulker once the railway and the barge terminal are up to full capacity. (The mine isn’t really a bottleneck: it’s more a matter of simply scooping ore up and putting it in railway cars rather than mining as generally understood.)\n\nBut Simandou is expected to ramp up fast over the next few years, perhaps shipping 120 million tons annually in the near term. It’s also expected that most – if not all – of that ore will go to China.\n\nThat matters, because Australian control over the bulk of China’s iron ore supply is often thought to be one of the factors holding Xi Jinping back from an active military campaign to conquer Taiwan. Australia would surely cease shipments of ore in response to such a campaign, and the damage to China’s enormous industries would be colossal.\n\nHowever, not many years from now, this would have much less effect as massive amounts of ore would still be shipping from Simandou. As the shape of the world’s cargo routes changes, so too will the calculus of power in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nConfrontation in the strait is in fact already under way, with Chinese military manoeuvres there now so menacing that the “Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis” is deemed to have been going on since 2022.\n\nThis is the background to Sir Keir’s visit to Beijing this week. Accompanied by British business leaders, his trip is reportedly aimed at restoring the “golden era” of Sino-British trade and investment seen under Theresa May.\n\nThe Starmer Government’s eagerness to woo China was apparent in its decision days ago to allow the new Chinese “super embassy” in London to go ahead – a decision described in The Telegraph by former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith as “a humiliating sell-out”.\n\nBritish messaging is mixed, however. Last week the nuclear-powered attack submarine HMS Anson arrived at Gibraltar. Gibraltar is the submarine’s first stop on her way to Australia, where she will probably spend at least six months based out of Perth as part of Submarine Rotational Force West.\n\nSRF-West is the first stage of the Australia-UK-US “Aukus” agreement, which will evolve into a tri-national force of nuclear attack boats based at Perth, and the infrastructure in Australia and the UK which will build and support them.\n\nSince Anson is probably the only serviceable attack submarine in the Royal Navy at the moment, and with the Russian threat in the Atlantic ever more present, it is clear that the Government is placing a very high priority indeed on Aukus.\n\nThe whole point of Aukus, of course, is to confront China’s growing power in the Pacific.\n\nMainland China refuses to have diplomatic relations with any nation which recognises Taiwan as independent.\n\nDiplomats, at least, believe that diplomatic relations with China are essential – although in the case of the UK the result appears to be a large piece of Chinese territory in central London occupied by a massive CCP spy fortress. Only a few small nations recognise Taiwan as independent, probably the best known being the Vatican.\n\nQuite a lot of nations, however, take an “ambiguous” stance towards Taiwanese independence. They have diplomatic relations with China, embassies and all, and they do not formally recognise Taiwan’s nationhood.\n\nThey do not have embassies in Taipei and Taiwan does not have embassies in their capitals, but there are people and buildings that do much the same thing.\n\nThe UK, for instance, has the British Office in Taipei, staffed by Foreign Office employees who would be diplomats if they were accredited as such.\n\nTaiwan has a similar “Taipei Representative Office” in Belgravia. There is a parking space across the street with “diplomats” painted on it, for all that the representatives in the office are – officially – not diplomats, which somewhat gives away the British Government’s real stance.\n\nRather more importantly, the entire US policy towards Taiwan has always been one of “strategic ambiguity”. What this has actually tended to mean, however, is fairly firm and evident American backing for Taiwanese independence and democracy.\n\nDuring the run up to the 1996 election in Taiwan, for instance, China made a serious attempt to frighten the Taiwanese into voting for the pro-Beijing candidate. More than 100,000 troops were mustered on the mainland side of the strait and amphibious invasion exercises took place.\n\nChina also fired ballistic missiles into Taiwanese territorial waters, causing enough upset that merchant shipping ceased using the strait twice and maritime insurance rates for Taiwan increased significantly.\n\nThis sabre-rattling, however, was largely negated by the arrival of two US aircraft carrier groups and other naval elements.\n\nThat confrontation is nowadays known as the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis (the first two, in the 1950s, involved artillery bombardments from the mainland against outlying Taiwan-controlled islands).\n\nChinese air and naval power was fairly negligible in the mid-1990s, a fact that was illustrated by the carrier USS Nimitz twice cruising through the strait along with various other US warships. The pro-Beijing candidate in Taiwan got less than 15pc of the vote.\n\nEver since then, the US military has assumed that a fight against China would be likely, with its traditional Cold War foe Russia relegated to second place.\n\nThis makes sense: the Chinese economy is now no less than 20 times the size it was in the mid-1990s and the CCP’s defence budget is the second biggest in the world, much bigger than that of Russia even with Vladimir Putin’s new war economy.\n\nNeedless to say, Chinese air and naval power are no longer negligible. Indeed, by count of warships the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is actually bigger than the US Navy, though America for the moment still has a considerable advantage in terms of overall tonnage and missile launch tubes – probably more important numbers.\n\nMeanwhile the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) now has hundreds of fifth-generation stealth fighters and more than 100 long-range strategic bombers able to mount devastating missile strikes against enemy fleets and bases far away.\n\nProbably more significantly still, the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) – this is a separate arm of service in China – does not only have intercontinental nuclear missiles.\n\nIt also has more than 3,000 shorter-ranging ballistic, hypersonic and cruise missiles able to strike targets with conventional warheads at great distances. In particular, US bases in Guam, Japan and South Korea are threatened, and if US warships in the region can be located and tracked, they can potentially be sunk.\n\nThe US military ought nonetheless to be enormously more powerful than China’s. US nominal GDP is still half again that of China, and crucially the US spends proportionally more on defence, or as the new administration prefers to put it, on “war”: 3.4pc to China’s 1.7pc. America’s colossal military spending, approaching $1tn a year, is roughly triple that of China.\n\nBut that isn’t the whole picture. Both China and the US mostly make their own armaments and recruit from their own labour markets: and the cost of Chinese-made weapons, planes, ships, etc, is much lower than US-made ones. Chinese soldiers, sailors and airmen are much cheaper than Americans.\n\nThis cost difference is illustrated by the fact that China’s vast shipbuilding industry, far and away the biggest in the world, built warships of a combined tonnage equal to the entire Royal Navy in just the four years up to 2025 and this rate is accelerating. American shipyards, so expensive that they can mostly win business only from the Pentagon, are struggling even to replace existing US warships as they wear out – let alone expand the fleet.\n\nComparisons like this explain the fact that on a purchasing-power parity basis, as opposed to nominal GDP, the Chinese economy is actually a third again bigger than the US.\n\nThis suggests that in terms of buying and hiring power the American war department only enjoys a 50pc advantage, rather than a three-fold one.\n\nThen there is the fact that a battle in the vicinity of Taiwan would see US forces operating at long range from their bases and the Chinese close to theirs.\n\nIn the scenario of an amphibious invasion by China, a US Navy attack submarine – or perhaps an allied Aukus one, HMS Anson or one of her successors – might well slip past or fight through relatively unpracticed PLAN anti-submarine forces and into the Taiwan Strait.\n\nParts of the strait are too shallow for a nuclear attack boat, but this would still be a fox-in-the-henhouse event for the invasion fleet: the sub’s torpedoes and missiles would take a fearful toll of the Chinese amphibious forces. The submarine might well survive to escape once it was out of weapons.\n\nBut if such a submarine were part of the Aukus force at Perth, it would then have a journey of 4,000 miles back to base to re-arm itself, and then another equally long voyage to get back into the fight.\n\nThe sub captain might head instead for a closer US base such as Guam, but this would still be nearly 2,000 miles away. The boat might then arrive only to find the base knocked out, or might be sunk at the jetty by long-ranging Chinese strikes.\n\nMeanwhile, a Chinese warship near Taiwan would be only briefly absent if it needed to resupply, meaning that each Chinese ship would deliver a lot more combat power than an equivalent US or allied one. The US president might choose to strike Chinese bases on the mainland, of course, but it is definitely possible that this would be viewed as overly escalatory – an ever-present consideration in a war where both sides have intercontinental nukes.\n\nAll these factors tend to erode the American spending advantage. It was not a total surprise when a Pentagon summary – the so-called “Overmatch Brief” – leaked last month.\n\nIt was based on years of US wargaming, classified intelligence briefings and simulations, and it stated categorically that America would “most likely suffer decisive defeat” if it attempted to intervene against any attempt by China to conquer Taiwan.\n\nOne reason that the Overmatch Brief is not surprising, of course, is that the Pentagon has every incentive to suggest that it needs more resources. Similarly the fact that it leaked to the media was not a shock – if nobody knows that such a document exists, it has much less effect. The Overmatch Brief may one day be compared to the “missile gap” and “bomber gap” ideas put forth by the US Air Force in the 1950s, claiming that the Soviet Union’s forces were hugely stronger than they actually were in an attempt to obtain a bigger budget.\n\nFactors of budget relative to scenario, indeed, have powerful effects on all militaries. For instance it seems clear that the first and quite probably decisive stages of any China-Taiwan-US shooting war would be an air and sea contest mostly involving long-range missiles. On the US side the missiles would mostly be launched from ships or aircraft.\n\nThis is a pleasing thought for the US Navy and the US Air Force. It is not at all pleasing for the US Army and Marine Corps, who would not wish to be left out.\n\nThis has led to the curious spectacle of the Marines converting many of their conventional combat units into so-called “Littoral Regiments” and the Army similarly creating what it calls “Multi Domain Task Forces”. Both of these are basically land-based missile units, a sort of American PLARF. The problem is that America would probably not wish to provoke China in advance, so they cannot be based on Taiwan and thus would probably not be all that much use.\n\nThese matters aside, the big question for Xi, Trump and the various China hawks in his team – undersecretary of defence for policy Elbridge Colby, for instance – is this: what would happen if China moved against Taiwan and the US intervened?\n\nThe usual way to find an answer to this sort of question is wargames – the military version of what is called “modelling”, if one is talking about subjects such as pandemic disease or climate change. There have been many wargames around the idea of a Chinese invasion or blockade of Taiwan.\n\nMost of them have taken place behind the curtain of classified information, as with the Overmatch Brief. Such models may benefit from better or more detailed data. What is almost always true is that secret modelling is even more likely to be driven by an underlying agenda than openly visible work.\n\nThat’s why it’s probably useful for most of us to look at public wargame modelling of a possible fight for Taiwan. An influential Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), has made a strong effort here.\n\nThe CSIS wargames acknowledge some uncomfortable realities for the US forces.\n\nAmerican cruisers and destroyers, for instance, have truly amazing defences against incoming Chinese missiles of various kinds, and such defences can mean that even a major Chinese strike can be resisted by a US aircraft carrier strike group or another kind of US Navy surface taskforce.\n\nBut the numbers are remorseless. In one example, China sends out a force of 24 H-6 heavy bombers armed with four YJ-12 ship-killer missiles each. The bombers can range far out into the Pacific, sweeping large stretches of ocean with their radar. If they have any vague idea where a US Navy task force may be, they can locate it.\n\nIf the US force includes a carrier, its radar plane is likely to detect the Chinese bombers long before they can find the carrier, and in that case the carrier’s fighters are likely to solve the problem.\n\nThe CSIS model doesn’t acknowledge the reality that a strike package of H-6s would be unlikely to get past responding US Navy fighters, especially if they were armed with the new beyond-visual-range air-launched SM-6.\n\nThe bombers would probably all have been shot out of the sky before they ever got a sniff of the carrier, which would remain below their radar horizon.\n\nBut if there are no US radar planes or fighters in play, the hail of missiles from the Chinese bombers is likely to overwhelm even the extremely strong Aegis/Standard defence of US cruisers and destroyers, sinking most if not all of them.\n\nIf the US ships do beat off such an attack, the Chinese bombers fly home, re-arm and return in a matter of hours. The American ships’ missile tubes will be largely empty this time, and this is before the extra firepower of the far-away land-based PLARF batteries comes into play.\n\nThe CSIS wargames still do not predict the clear-cut defeat seen in the Overmatch Brief. Indeed, their results suggest that in fact if the US is committed to the fight and doesn’t hesitate at the start, it can knock China back with a very bloody nose in the event of any serious fight over Taiwan.\n\nThe end result would be a Taiwan Strait filled with burning and sinking Chinese wrecks and the survivors of the Chinese invasion force trapped on Taiwan with their supply lines from the mainland cut, eventually forced to surrender.\n\nBut the US Navy and Air Force would have suffered on a scale not seen since the Second World War. Hundreds of American fighter jets would have been destroyed, mostly wrecked on the ground in their bases in Japan and elsewhere by long-ranging Chinese strikes.\n\nThe US Navy and its allies would lose dozens of ships and thousands of sailors. HMS Anson or her future successor on SRF-West would probably have done a huge amount of damage to the PLAN and its amphibious fleet, knowing our submariners, but they would in all likelihood have gone down fighting in the end, assuming they could rearm and get back in the battle often enough.\n\nBoth China and the US would be seriously damaged as global military powers, and Taiwan would still be free but shattered as a nation and an economy – and that would mean knock-on damage to all world economies, given how vital the Taiwanese semiconductor industry is to us all.\n\nThe lesson of history for us all to take away – not only the US, but Australia, Britain and everyone else in the West – is that ancient and well-tried truism: if you would have peace, prepare yourself for war.\n\nThe way to persuade Xi Jinping not to invade Taiwan is to make the chance of failure higher.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Sunday his country has no intention of pursuing a free trade deal with China.  Carney said his recent agreement with China merely cuts tariffs on a few sectors that were recently hit with tariffs.",
    "fullText": "TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Sunday his country has no intention of pursuing a free trade deal with China. He was responding to U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to impose a 100% tariff on goods imported from Canada if America’s northern neighbor went ahead with a trade deal with Beijing.\n\nCarney said his recent agreement with China merely cuts tariffs on a few sectors that were recently hit with tariffs.\n\nTrump claims otherwise, posting that “China is successfully and completely taking over the once Great Country of Canada. So sad to see it happen. I only hope they leave Ice Hockey alone! President DJT”\n\nThe prime minister said under the free trade agreement with the U.S. and Mexico there are commitments not to pursue free trade agreements with nonmarket economies without prior notification.\n\n“We have no intention of doing that with China or any other nonmarket economy,” Carney said. “What we have done with China is to rectify some issues that developed in the last couple of years.”\n\nIn 2024, Canada mirrored the United States by putting a 100% tariff on electric vehicles from Beijing and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum. China had responded by imposing 100% import taxes on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood.\n\nBreaking with the United States this month during a visit to China, Carney cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on those Canadian products.\n\nCarney has said there would be an initial annual cap of 49,000 vehicles on Chinese EV exports coming into Canada at a tariff rate of 6.1%, growing to about 70,000 over five years. He noted there was no cap before 2024. He also has said the initial cap on Chinese EV imports was about 3% of the 1.8 million vehicles sold in Canada annually and that, in exchange, China is expected to begin investing in the Canadian auto industry within three years.\n\nTrump posted a video Sunday in which the chief executive of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association warns there will be no Canadian auto industry without U.S. access, while noting the Canadian market alone is too small to justify large scale manufacturing from China.\n\n“A MUST WATCH. Canada is systematically destroying itself. The China deal is a disaster for them. Will go down as one of the worst deals, of any kind, in history. All their businesses are moving to the USA. I want to see Canada SURVIVE AND THRIVE! President DJT,\" Trump posted on social media.\n\nTrump's post on Saturday said that if Carney “thinks he is going to make Canada a ‘Drop Off Port’ for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken.”\n\n“We can’t let Canada become an opening that the Chinese pour their cheap goods into the U.S,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on ABC’s “This Week.”\n\n“We have a (United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement), but based off -- based on that, which is going to be renegotiated this summer, and I’m not sure what Prime Minister Carney is doing here, other than trying to virtue-signal to his globalist friends at Davos.”\n\nTrump’s threat came amid an escalating war of words with Carney as the Republican president’s push to acquire Greenland strained the NATO alliance.\n\nCarney has emerged as a leader of a movement for countries to find ways to link up and counter the U.S. under Trump. Speaking in Davos before Trump, Carney said, “Middle powers must act together because if you are not at the table, you are on the menu” and he warned about coercion by great powers — without mentioning Trump’s name. The prime minister received widespread praise and attention for his remarks, upstaging Trump at the World Economic Forum.\n\nTrump’s push to acquire Greenland has come after he has repeatedly needled Canada over its sovereignty and suggested it also be absorbed into the United States as a 51st state. He posted an altered image on social media this week showing a map of the United States that included Canada, Venezuela, Greenland and Cuba as part of its territory.",

    "description": "China's most senior general is under investigation, China's defence ministry said on Saturday, in the highest-profile purge to date of senior military leadership just as Beijing",
    "fullText": "Jan 24 (Reuters) - China's most senior general is under investigation, China's defence ministry said on Saturday, in the highest-profile purge to date of senior military leadership just as Beijing modernises its forces and tries to further project its might.\n\nZhang Youxia serves as second-in-command under President Xi Jinping as vice-chairman of the Central ​Military Commission - the supreme command body - and has long been seen as Xi's closest military ally.\n\nThe ministry said Zhang and Liu Zhenli, chief of staff of the ‌CMC's Joint Staff Department, were under investigation for suspected serious violations of discipline and law.\n\nZhang is also a member of the elite Politburo of the ruling Communist Party and is one of just a few leading officers with ‌combat experience.\n\nSWEEPING CRACKDOWN TARGETS MILITARY\n\nThe military was one of the main targets of a broad corruption crackdown ordered by Xi in 2012. That drive reached the upper echelons of the People's Liberation Army in 2023 when the elite Rocket Force was targeted.\n\nZhang's removal is the second of a sitting general on the Central Military Commission since the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. He has not been seen in public since November 20, when he held talks with Russia's defence minister in Moscow.\n\nForeign diplomats and security analysts are watching developments closely, given Zhang's closeness to Xi and the importance of the commission's work ⁠in terms of command as well as the PLA's ongoing ‌military modernisation and posture.\n\nWhile China has not fought a war in decades, it is taking an increasingly muscular line in the disputed East China Sea and South China Sea, as well as over the self-ruled island of Taiwan, which is claimed by China. Beijing staged the ‍largest military exercises to date around Taiwan late last year.\n\nSingapore-based China security scholar James Char said the military's daily operations could carry on as normal despite the purges but the targeting of Zhang showed Xi was reacting to criticism that the crackdown had been too selective.\n\n\"Xi has been tapping on second-line PLA officers to fill those roles vacated by their predecessors – on an interim basis in most cases,\" said Char, ​a scholar at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.\n\n\"China’s military modernizers will continue to push for the two goals Xi has set for the PLA – namely, 2035 to basically complete ‌its modernisation and 2049 to become a world-class armed forces.\"\n\nZhang is the second vice chair of the CMC to fall from grace in recent months. Former CMC vice chair He Weidong was expelled from the party and PLA in October last year for corruption. He was replaced by Zhang Shengmin.\n\nEight top generals were expelled from the Communist Party on graft charges in October 2025, including He Weidong.\n\nTwo former defence ministers were also purged from the ruling party in recent years for corruption. The crackdown is slowing procurement of advanced weaponry and hitting the revenues of some of China's biggest defence firms.\n\nBoth Xi and Zhang are from the northwestern province of Shaanxi and are the children of former senior officials who fought together ⁠in the 1940s civil war.\n\nBorn in Beijing, Zhang joined the army in 1968, rising through the ranks ​and joining the military commission in late 2012 as the PLA's modernisation drive gathered pace.\n\nA Pentagon profile of Zhang ​in late 2023 noted that Zhang had been expected to retire in 2022, aged 72, given usual military practice.\n\n\"However, Zhang's retention on the CMC for a third term probably reflects Xi's desire to keep a close and experienced ally as his top military adviser,\" the profile said, contained within the ‍Pentagon's annual report on China's military that year.\n\nHe ⁠fought Vietnam in a brief but bloody border war in 1979 that China launched in punishment for Vietnam invading Cambodia the previous year and ousting the Beijing-backed Khmer Rouge.\n\nZhang was 26 when he was sent to the front lines to fight the Vietnamese and was quickly promoted, according to state media. He also fought in another border ⁠clash with Vietnam in 1984 as the conflict rumbled on.\n\n\"During the battle, whether attacking or defending, Zhang Youxia performed excellently,\" the official China Youth Daily wrote in a 2017 piece entitled, \"These Chinese generals have killed the enemy ‌on the battlefield\".\n\nSome China scholars have noted that Zhang emerged from the conflict an avowed moderniser in terms of military tactics, weapons and the need for ‌a better trained force.",

    "title": "How China's 'Hurricane 3000' Microwave Weapon Drops Drones From The Air",
    "description": "Drone swarms can quickly overwhelm defenses and are difficult to combat effectively, but China's new microwave system could be about to change that.",
    "fullText": "The ongoing war in Ukraine has changed the face of battlefields forever. The widespread use of drones has left traditional air defenses floundering; launching missiles that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to counter threats that may only cost a few hundred dollars is not practical. Scale this up to countering swarms of drones, and the logistics, costs, and effectiveness of such systems wane even further. This is why systems like Israel's Iron Beam laser weapon that can destroy drones for a few dollars \"a pop\" are being developed and introduced into combat service.\n\nThe Chinese Hurricane 3000 system is another new weapon developed to tackle the growing use of drones in combat. However, unlike the laser-based Israeli system, the Hurricane 3000  system uses microwaves to disable drones and drone swarms at ranges exceeding 3 kilometers (1.9 miles). This is a similar weapon to the US Army's Leonidas microwave weapon, although China claims that the 3000's reported three-kilometer-plus range is over a kilometer more than the Leonidas system.\n\nThe Zhuhai Airshow in 2024 was when the public got a first peek at the new system, and it was later showcased during a military parade in Beijing in September 2025. More recently, Norinco, the Chinese state-owned contractor that developed the system, has disclosed some of the system's technical details and its intended role. Both systems are vehicle-mounted and can be operated independently or networked into a cohesive air defence system with missile, laser, and artillery units.\n\nThe history of war is not just a tale of conflicts; it's also often a story of an arms race that can seesaw dramatically. The rising use of drones on the battlefield amply demonstrates this point, as arms manufacturers clamor to come up with practical solutions to address this threat not just effectively, but cost-effectively. The use of high-power microwave weapons (HPM) is one area where developers have thrown a lot of resources, and the Chinese weapon is the latest manifestation of this.\n\nUnlike laser or kinetic weapons, HPMs are designed to overwhelm a drone or a UAV's electronic systems using bursts of concentrated electromagnetic energy. These bursts travel at the speed of light and can cause drones to fail in several ways, including EMI-induced timing errors and physical damage to electronic components. Another feature of such weapons is their versatility; advanced systems like Epirus' Leonidas can not only target specific drones but have already disabled a swarm of 49 drones in a few seconds. And, as long as they have power, the other main advantages of these weapons are a bottomless ammunition supply and an exponentially lower engagement cost.\n\nThe fact that these beams travel at the speed of light allows a rapid response once a target is detected and tracked. This makes them effective against fast, low-flying drones that are difficult (and potentially costly) to intercept using traditional air-defense methods. However, the system isn't flawless; it's generally considered to be a line-of-sight weapon, and its effectiveness can be reduced with effective shielding.\n\nThe Hurricane 3000 and its smaller Hurricane 2000 variant are mobile, truck-mounted systems that have moved from the experimental stage to field deployment and were showcased at China's 2025 V-Day Military Parade. The more advanced Hurricane 3000 system has a longer range,  improved tracking, detection, and fully automated combat capabilities. Overall, according to Yu Jianjun, a Norinco expert, the 3000 represents a \"comprehensive upgrade in combat performance compared to the Hurricane 2000.\"\n\nThe system uses radar to detect threats at longer ranges. Once detected, the system switches to optoelectronic sensors to guide the microwave antennas onto the target. However, this is not designed to replace existing air defenses. Rather, it's intended to complement the existing \"traditional\" missile and artillery systems to form an \"iron triangle\" drone defense system, with each system used to its own strengths.\n\nWhile the primary focus of the development program was to develop an effective way of countering the drone threat, Norinco says it wants to explore other potential applications for the platform. Mr. Yu said that among the options being explored are the use of the weapon to counter electronic warfare aircraft, interrupt communications, counteracting precision weapons, and, it's being proposed as a non-lethal active denial system against people. The latter is a beam of focused energy that can cause the recipients to encounter an intolerable burning sensation that has a minimal risk of injury.\n\nIn short, the Hurricane and similar weapons exist because shooting million-dollar missiles at hobby-grade drones stopped making sense.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "LONDON/WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. control of Venezuela's oil exports has ensnared barrels that had been servicing debt to China, lining up another potential showdown between the two superpowers that could further complicate the South American country's path out of default.\n\nAround a tenth of Venezuela's $150 billion foreign debt pile is estimated to be loans from China that ​the OPEC member was paying in oil cargoes - until the U.S. seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro earlier this month.\n\nDebt experts said the ramifications of China's claim on the cargoes and any clash with ‌the United States could make it tougher for Venezuela to restructure its debt after a 2017 default and put at risk Beijing's cooperation in restructuring deals for other developing nations.\n\n\"Even under the best circumstances, this was going to be very messy - trying to disentangle where all ‌these creditors stand in the credit hierarchy,\" said Christopher Hodge, chief economist with Natixis and a former U.S. Treasury official.\n\n\"The fact that now America is controlling all the finances into and out of the country...this seems to be unprecedented to me, that we're going to have such entanglements, such opacity about the finances of a government,\" Hodge said.\n\nWhile Washington currently controls only oil sale proceeds, Hodge noted that these are Venezuela's main source of revenue.\n\nDocuments and sources from state-run oil firm PDVSA show three supertankers have been shuttling between Venezuela and China over the last five years carrying oil for interest payments under the terms of a temporary deal struck in 2019. But these shipments are only ⁠a fraction of Venezuela's total crude exports to China.\n\nAidData, a research lab at ‌the U.S. university William & Mary that tracks lending, said some cash proceeds from oil sent to China went into an account controlled by Beijing and on to service the debt - even as sanctions and default blocked payments to many of Venezuela's other creditors.\n\nThe Trump administration has now said that proceeds from the sale of Venezuela's oil will go into ‍a Qatar-based account controlled by Washington, potentially giving the U.S. President himself substantial leverage over which creditors get paid, and when.\n\nIn response to a request for comment on the cargoes and debt payments, China's foreign ministry said Beijing \"has repeatedly stated its position\".\n\nBeijing condemned the redirection of Venezuelan oil exports during a January 7 news conference, adding \"legitimate rights and interests of China and other countries in Venezuela must be protected\".\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Reuters that Trump had brokered an oil deal with Venezuela ​that \"will benefit the American and Venezuelan people\".\n\nThe Trump administration is allowing China to purchase Venezuelan oil but not at the \"unfair, undercut\" prices at which Caracas sold the crude previously, a U.S. official said on Thursday.\n\nTraders managing Venezuelan oil ‌sales have offered some to Chinese refiners, but these are private market transactions, not intended as debt payments.\n\n\"The people of Venezuela will collect a fair price for their oil from China and other nations,\" the U.S. official said.\n\nThe Venezuelan communications ministry, which handles all press inquiries for the government, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nTrump could yet make a deal with China. However, the planned U.S. takeover of Venezuela's oil sector and control of its revenue could upend the hierarchy of creditors, restructuring advisors warn.\n\n\"All of these things will have the practical effect of subordinating the claims of legacy debtholders,\" said global sovereign debt expert Lee Buchheit, adding it was unclear if Trump had the legal right to determine who gets paid first.\n\nSome $60 billion of Venezuela's bonds tipped into default in 2017, and a restructuring agreement is essential to enable it to borrow again and attract new ⁠investment.\n\nIn a typical restructuring, bilateral lenders come together and agree what losses they will accept, usually via the Paris Club of ​creditor nations. This sets the bar for the \"comparable\" losses private lenders - bond investors, banks and others - must take.\n\n\"Comparability of treatment will be ​a real challenge, particularly if the U.S. controls the use of oil revenues,\" said Mark Walker, a longtime sovereign debt advisor who previously worked on potential Venezuelan restructurings.\n\nIf the U.S. pushes China to swallow significant writedowns on its debt - and China digs its heels in - it could slow a restructuring and hinder Venezuela's economic recovery in the process.\n\nThat could ‍keep Venezuela \"in very dire straits during the foreseeable future\", said ⁠Jean-Charles Sambor, head of emerging market debt with TT International, which holds Venezuelan bonds. In turn, this would limit how much the country can afford to repay to bondholders and other creditors.\n\nChina has little immediate leverage. Countries typically do not take other nations to court or arbitration over lending claims, Walker said, and would need to settle the situation \"on a government-to-government basis\".\n\nBut ramifications are possible: China is the ⁠largest bilateral lender to the developing world and its cooperation with the Paris Club has been crucial over the past decade. Beijing agreed restructuring terms via a platform called the Common Framework during Ghana, Zambia and Ethiopia's debt restructuring talks.\n\n\"China's obvious leverage is to refuse ‌to cooperate in future Common Framework sovereign debt workouts until it feels that it has been treated fairly in Venezuela,\" Buchheit said. \"And that threat would have some force.\"",

    "fullText": "Two malicious extensions in Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code (VSCode) Marketplace that were collectively installed 1.5 million times exfiltrate developer data to China-based servers.\n\nBoth extensions are advertised as AI-based coding assistants that provide the promised functionality. However, they do not disclose the upload activity or ask users for consent to deliver data to a remote server.\n\nThe VS Code Marketplace is the official store for add-ons for Microsoft’s popular code editor. VS Code extensions are installable plugins from the marketplace that add features or integrate tools into the editor. One of the most popular add-on categories right now is AI-powered coding assistants.\n\nResearchers at endpoint and supply-chain security company Koi say that the two malicious extensions are part of a campaign they dubbed 'MaliciousCorgi' and share the same code for stealing developer data.\n\nAdditionally, both of them use the same spyware infrastructure and communicate with the same backend servers. At publishing time, both are present on the marketplace:\n\nThe extensions use three distinct data-collection mechanisms. The first involves real-time monitoring of files opened in the VS Code client. When a file is accessed, its entire contents are encoded in Base64 and transmitted to the attackers’ servers.\n\nAny changes to the opened file are also captured and exfiltrated.\n\n\"The moment you open any file – not interact with it, just open it – the extension reads its entire contents, encodes it as Base64, and sends it to a webview containing a hidden tracking iframe. Not 20 lines. The entire file,\"  Koi researchers say.\n\nThe second mechanism involves a server-controlled file-harvesting command that stealthily transmits up to 50 files from the victim’s workspace each time.\n\nThe third mechanism uses a zero-pixel iframe in the extension’s webview to load four commercial analytics SDKs: Zhuge.io, GrowingIO, TalkingData, and Baidu Analytics.\n\nThese SDKs are used to track user behavior, build identity profiles, fingerprint devices, and monitor activity inside the editor. So, while the first two collect developer work files, the third focuses on user profiling.\n\nKoi Security highlights the risks posed by undocumented functionality in these extensions, including the exposure of private source code, configuration files, cloud service credentials, and .env files containing API keys and credentials.\n\nBleepingComputer has contacted Microsoft about the presence of the two extensions on the VSCode market, but we are still waiting for a reply. We were unable to establish a communication channel with the publisher of the extensions.\n\nWhether you're cleaning up old keys or setting guardrails for AI-generated code, this guide helps your team build securely from the start.\n\nGet the cheat sheet and take the guesswork out of secrets management.",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW, Jan 23 (Reuters) - China is set to ramp up imports of Russian oil in January, absorbing barrels that would have previously gone to India ​and Turkey, as tougher Western sanctions force Moscow to redirect flows, LSEG data ‌and traders said.\n\nThe United States and the European Union imposed sweeping sanctions in late 2025 targeting Russian oil ‌sellers and shippers, including energy giants Rosneft and Lukoil, complicating purchases for global buyers and tightening scrutiny on Russian crude exports.\n\nChina is poised to receive nearly 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of Russian oil by sea this month, compared with 1.1 million bpd in December, according to ⁠preliminary LSEG data. Beijing, already ‌a key consumer of Russian Far East ESPO Blend, also boosted imports of Russian Urals oil to a record high of 405,000 bpd ‍in January, the highest since mid-2023, data provided by energy consultancy Kpler showed.\n\nIndia, previously the largest buyer of Russian Urals by sea since the EU embargo on Moscow's oil in 2022, slashed purchases ​to below 1 million bpd in December, down from an average of 1.3 million ‌bpd last year, LSEG data showed. Indian refiners are expected to keep Russian oil imports near 1 million bpd in January as they diversify supply sources.\n\nTurkey, also a major Russian oil buyer, reduced Urals imports in January to about 250,000 bpd, compared to an average of 275,000 bpd in 2025 and well below the record 400,000 bpd reached in June ⁠last year.\n\n\"As Indian and Turkish buyers cut purchases ​recently, some Russian Urals cargoes headed for China,\" said ​a trader involved in Russian oil sales. He added that the surplus of Urals barrels weighed on prices.\n\nDiscounts for Urals crude delivered to China ‍in late 2025 widened ⁠to as much as $12 per barrel below ICE Brent for some cargoes, while current Urals differentials hover near minus $10 to the benchmark, according to two traders active ⁠in the Asian market.\n\nDemand for Urals in India and Turkey, both major exporters of diesel to Europe, slumped ‌due to the EU ban on fuels produced from Russian-origin crude, the ‌traders added.",

    "description": "“The limiting factor for AI deployment is fundamentally electrical power,” Musk said at the World Economic Forum on Thursday.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk warned the biggest issue hampering AI advancement in the United States is a problem Chinese competitors don’t have.\n\nIn a conversation in Davos, Switzerland, with BlackRock CEO and World Economic Forum interim chair Larry Fink, Musk said AI chip production is increasing exponentially, but electrical power is insufficient, hampering the efficiency of AI data centers in training and deploying AI models.\n\n“I think the limiting factor for AI deployment is fundamentally electrical power,” Musk said. “It’s clear that we’re very soon—maybe even later this year—we’ll be producing more chips than we can turn on.”\n\nThe U.S. has been grappling with an outdated grid system, the result of decades of underinvestment and an aging infrastructure. As tech companies increasingly rely on grid operators for electrical power, reliability issues and production limitations have threatened the speed of AI implementation, raising investor concerns of an AI bubble and fueling the belief that the U.S. has already lost the battle with Chinese tech.\n\nTwo massive data centers in Nvidia’s Santa Clara, Calif., hometown may sit empty for years waiting for electricity to power them, according to energy experts. Meanwhile, the massive increase in demand, combined with the need for updated infrastructure, have driven up electricity bills for the average American.\n\nEarlier this month, the Trump administration and 13 bipartisan governors mounted pressure on operators of the country’s largest grid, PJM Interconnection, to boost power supply, as well as hold an auction for tech firms to make offers on 15-year contracts to build power plants, which would transfer the cost of electricity away from consumers and to data center operators.\n\n“We know that with the demands of AI and the power and the productivity that comes with that, it’s going to transform every job and every company and every industry,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum told reporters last week. “But we need to be able to power that in the race that we are in against China.”\n\nDuring his remarks at the gathering in Davos on Wednesday, President Donald Trump encouraged tech companies to build their own nuclear plants amid the AI push, which he claimed the administration would approve in just three weeks—although these historically take years to approve.\n\nJust as many AI investors fear, China is already well ahead of the U.S. when it comes to production capacity, and the country isn’t saddled with the same limitations as the U.S., Musk said at Davos. China is primarily reliant on solar power, seen as a less expensive alternative to nuclear power, with quicker deployment and fewer safety risks.",

    "description": "Military competition between the US and rivals Russia and China in the Arctic is exposing weaknesses in the US arsenal.",
    "fullText": "For war across the freezing Arctic battlefields, the US faces a problem: it doesn't have the right weapons or tools to reliably detect threats in the region and respond to them quickly.\n\nThe Arctic is an unforgiving place for a war. It's a location where distances are vast, subzero temperatures can cripple equipment, and forces must operate with limited support infrastructure, but as competition with US rivals and adversaries becomes fiercer, there is a growing realization that a future fight could unfold across an Arctic battlespace. Among experts and officials, there's also increasing concern about US readiness.\n\nIf US forces in the region can't spot threats early, position assets effectively, and sustain troops in harsh conditions, the region could become a corridor for undetected attacks.\n\nGaps in Arctic defenses have been one element of President Donald Trump's erratic rhetoric on US interests in the acquisition of Greenland. He has said it is necessary for the substantial US missile defense project known as Golden Dome.\n\n\"If there is a war, much of the action will take place on that piece of ice,\" Trump said on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"Think of it: those missiles would be flying right over the center.\"\n\nThe president isn't the first to call attention to the strategic and national security implications surrounding the Arctic. Warnings have come from across administrations.\n\nLeaders in Washington have expressed similar concerns about the importance of the Arctic region for homeland defense in recent years. In its 2024 Arctic strategy doctrine, the US Department of Defense emphasized the need for better, more modernized all-domain awareness, surveillance and sensors, naval capabilities, and missile warning technologies. Existing systems, the department said, weren't sufficient for the growing threats in the region.\n\nSpecifically, the US, along with some of its NATO allies, has underinvested in capabilities needed to detect, track, and respond to activity across vast Arctic distances.\n\nSome necessary capabilities include aerial and underwater surveillance, as well as defense and naval warfare capabilities like anti-submarine frigates, heavy icebreakers, polar-capable multi-mission surface vessels, and dual-use sealift capacity, Liselotte Odgaard, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, wrote in a new report. Infrastructure such as undersea sensor networks, command and control systems, ports, runways, and roads is also lacking.\n\n\"As a result, the US and its allies have insufficient monitoring, response, and sustainment options,\" she explained. \"These shortfalls allow adversaries to transit waters and territories undetected, sustain forces in combat theaters for prolonged periods, and successfully challenge allied forces in combat-like situations.\"\n\nUS presence, whether through domain awareness or more constant exercises in the region, has also been lacking, leaving the Arctic as the \"shortest and least defended threat sector,\" former deputy commander of US Northern Command, Army Gen. Thomas Carden, said in 2024.\n\nWith recognition of the challenges has come new efforts. Recent moves, like the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Coast Guard’s fiscal year 2026 budget, have included millions of dollars for new icebreakers, Coast Guard cutters, and needed Arctic infrastructure upgrades. The Coast Guard’s newly renamed Arctic District has taken on a more prominent monitoring role, and last year, the service received its first polar icebreaker in over 25 years.\n\nAdditionally, the US is working to field new air defense systems and interceptors to replace or supplement the ones in Alaska. And the Space Force's 2026 budget includes billions for Golden Dome, specifically space-based sensors and interceptors, and modernization efforts at Pituffik Space Base in Greenland.\n\nBut key areas remain underdeveloped.\n\nAs Odgaard wrote in her new report, parts of the airspace over eastern Greenland and the North Pole are not consistently surveilled, and the submarine detection and tracking capabilities along Greenland's eastern coast fall short of what is needed.\n\nThose gaps are concerning as Russia focuses on expanding submarine operations in the Arctic.\n\nUncrewed systems, both naval and aerial drones, could, in theory, extend surveillance coverage across vast areas that are expensive and difficult to patrol without increasing the demand on traditional crewed aircraft and assets.\n\nThe harsh Arctic environment could challenge such efforts. With drones, it could stress their batteries, range, connections, and performance. Recent exercises have shown troops that temperatures below freezing, low visibility, snowy or icy conditions, and strong winds can degrade aerial drones and other equipment.\n\nThe US' renewed investments in preparation for Arctic warfare come as Russia and China are deepening cooperation and more actively pursuing interests in the region. Russia has been looking to expand where its submarines can operate as China positions itself strategically as a \"near Arctic\" nation, joining Russia on joint patrols, including ones near Alaska. China is also investing in naval capabilities, ships, and drones for the region.",

    "fullText": "While the US military has pursued ambitious technological advances, manpower remains one of its core pillars.\n\nFrom high-ranking generals to soldiers on the field, human troops remain a key way to assess the reach and power of the world's militaries.\n\nUsing data from the International Institute for Strategic Studies' 2025 Military Balance report, Business Insider ranked countries by the size of their active armed forces and listed their defense budgets, based on 2024 figures.\n\nActive-duty force size is a tally of a country's uniformed troops: airmen, soldiers, sailors, special operators, and Marines. Armies, in particular, depend on size to gain and occupy ground. Militaries can also be a tool of domestic repression, a focus that undercuts its capabilities against an external foe. North Korea, for example, is one of the world's most repressive states, led by a dictator who has repeatedly threatened neighboring South Korea.\n\nThe number of active-duty military personnel is far from the only factor that matters when comparing military power between countries, but it shows latent power that could be augmented via conscription and calling up reservists.\n\n\"Numbers have value, but there's a lot more to military capability,\" said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, DC-based foreign policy and national security think tank.\n\nIISS, a London-headquartered think tank, counts active armed forces, reservists, and paramilitaries as separate categories in its analysis, showing a fuller picture of each nation's manpower.\n\nSome countries have significantly higher numbers of reservists than others — Vietnam has the largest number in the world, estimated at 5 million.\n\nBut while reservists can aid militaries when needed, the quality and longevity of their expertise can vary between conscription- and volunteer-based systems, Cancian told Business Insider.\n\n\"When you look at some countries' reserve numbers, you're often looking at people who haven't trained in 10 or 20 years,\" he said. \"It gives you a big number, but their military value is questionable.\"\n\nAnd while paramilitaries can be effective at enforcing internal security and party strength, Cancian says that \"as a military force, they have essentially zero value.\"\n\nEven when accounting for all of a military's manpower, personnel is only one of the various factors that can qualify a nation's military strength, which also include equipment and readiness.\n\nThere's also the role of technologies in global warfare, the size and sophistication of air forces and naval fleets, amphibious capabilities to land assault forces, command and control systems, or nuclear forces, which all shape military power. Larger and more advanced forces require higher state expenditures.\n\nStill, comparing global manpower offers insight into how countries prioritize military power.\n\nSee how the world's largest militaries stack up.",

    "fullText": "Open source — that might be the clearest signal of how China wants artificial intelligence to reshape its economy.\n\nHisham Alrayes, the group CEO of Bahrain-based GFH Financial Group, said China is prioritizing open models and broad deployment to spread AI's gains across the economy, instead of funneling them to a few tech giants.\n\nSpeaking at a Davos panel on China's \"AI+ Economy\" strategy on Wednesday, Alrayes said the country's approach reflects a fundamentally different economic philosophy.\n\n\"You look at the open structure of the China AI philosophy — then you have the non-open structure,\" Alrayes said. \"That signals that the benefit they want to see is to trickle down into the economy, into the companies.\"\n\nChina's most prominent AI breakout, DeepSeek, reflects that philosophy.\n\nIt mostly uses open-source models that have drawn global attention, in contrast to many large US language models that remain closed and proprietary, reaping the benefits of tightly controlled commercial ecosystems.\n\nMeta's former chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, has said that a key reason behind DeepSeek's success is its open-source model, which, he said, can outperform proprietary models in terms of efficiency and innovation by building on shared research.\n\nMeanwhile, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has said that China's open-source AI models could gain an edge globally because they're free, making them more attractive than costly proprietary US systems for governments and countries that can't afford closed models.\n\nSimilarly, Alrayes said, China — in pursuing the open model — is aiming for affordability and scale.\n\n\"It's not the benefit of that company, of that product, the return of that individual. It's not an individual — it's an economy,\" Alrayes said.\n\nThat philosophy is reflected in China's national \"AI Plus\" action plan, which prioritizes diffusion, said fellow panelist Gong Ke, executive director of the Chinese Institute for New Generation AI Development Strategies at Nankai University.\n\nThe policy, he said, focuses on embedding AI across manufacturing, healthcare, finance, education, and other sectors, rather than on breakthroughs such as artificial general intelligence.\n\nHe added that the plan sets explicit adoption targets, with AI agents and intelligent terminals expected to reach 70% penetration by 2027 and 90% by 2030.\n\nAlrayes said China's open-source tilt ultimately reflects a broader goal: making AI an economic utility rather than a profit center for a small group of companies.\n\n\"China is looking to create value throughout the economy, very clear, with very specific objectives across the economy,\" he said. \"Not just as a benefit to those companies.

    "fullText": "In cities across Australia, fleets of nice-looking electric buses quietly ferry thousands of commuters each day. But new warnings from cybersecurity experts have transformed what once looked like a clean energy success story into a geopolitical flashpoint.\n\nOfficials in Australia and the United Kingdom now say some Chinese-made buses may contain code that theoretically lets the buses’ manufacturer shut them down remotely via a so-called “kill switch.”\n\nThe revelation has renewed global fears about foreign-controlled technology embedded in critical infrastructure.\n\nThe spotlight is on the Yutong-made battery-electric buses. It’s a major Chinese manufacturer whose vehicles have been widely purchased in Australia’s capital, Canberra, and other jurisdictions.\n\nBritish reports, citing tests by the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre and Transport for the UK government, found that similar models in Europe could be accessed remotely by the manufacturer’s systems, including diagnostics and software updates, and that, theoretically, such access could be used to stop a bus’s drive system.\n\nThis marks a dramatic escalation in cyber-risk warnings tied that aren’t about phone networks or internet routers but about public transit vehicles. Transport Canberra reportedly responded by launching a fresh investigation into cybersecurity risks linked to the buses, following the British analysis and earlier flags from Norwegian transit authorities who found what they termed a functional remote shutdown capability during tests.\n\nTo cyber researchers, the worry is not that a Chinese government operator is now flipping switches in real time, since there aren’t any confirmed cases of foreign actors actively disabling buses. The concern is that the vulnerability exists at all in imported vehicles that operate on public streets and, in some cases, carry government employees and personnel.\n\n“This isn’t just about buses,” Australian cybersecurity expert Alastair MacGibbon told local media. “It goes to how much control is embedded in the technology we import, and whether those controls could be abused.”\n\nThis episode in neighboring Australia (ally, we mean) reads like vindication for policymakers in the US who have long sounded the alarm over dependencies on Chinese technology.\n\nTransport Secretary Sean Duffy and other hardliners have repeatedly asserted that Chinese-linked vehicles and connected technologies pose unacceptable security risks — even going so far as to say China should never sell cars (or similarly connected vehicles) on American roads “as long as I have breath in my body.”\n\nWhile those comments were dismissed as bluster by critics, the Australian “kill-switch” story has suddenly given them a concrete, globally reported incident to point to.\n\nIn Washington, the Biden administration tightened restrictions on connected vehicles containing Chinese software or hardware, with new rules designed to ban such imports by model year 2027 — a response to precisely the kinds of national security vulnerabilities highlighted by the Australian case.\n\nOpponents of these policies argue that connectivity features, including remote diagnostics and over-the-air updates, are standard across the global auto and transit industries, not unique to Chinese manufacturers.\n\nIndeed, any modern vehicle with internet connectivity might in theory be accessed remotely, whether made in Beijing, Detroit, or Tokyo. Critics in China have taken to global media to warn that U.S. bans could backfire by raising costs and supply chain challenges for American automakers dependent on global components.\n\nBut for many U.S. national security experts, the defining issue isn’t simply connectivity but control. If a foreign company can access the mission-critical systems of vehicles running on public streets — or the energy grids, solar inverters, or AI systems that undergird modern life — then that access becomes a lever that adversaries could exploit during crises.\n\nThe Australian episode has already spurred official reviews of every Yutong model in service. Transport Canberra officials insist there is no immediate operational concern based on current investigations, and that local buses are updated via physical service centers rather than remote connectivity.\n\nBut the warning’s broader resonance has rippled through capitals from London to Canberra, Oslo to Washington: as nations electrify their transit fleets and embrace connected vehicles, they must also reckon with who controls that connectedness.\n\nAnd for American lawmakers who warned loudly (and, in the eyes of some, prematurely) that Chinese technology on wheels isn’t just another import, this moment may well feel like a long-anticipated reckoning.",

GM will instead build the next generation of the vehicle at its assembly plant in the Kansas City area ⁠starting in 2028.\n\n“This decision further ‌strengthens GM’s domestic manufacturing footprint and supports U.S. jobs,” the automaker said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nGM has shipped ‍the Envision to the U.S. since 2017 as its only Chinese import. GM has faced a 25% tariff on the vehicles since 2018, and did not win ​an exemption from the tariff during the first Trump administration.\n\nThe Envision ‌became a target for critics of Chinese-made goods, including leaders of the United Auto Workers union and members in key political swing states such as Michigan and Ohio.\n\nTariffs on vehicles imported from China increased last year amid a trade war between Washington and Beijing.\n\nLast year, GM announced it would ⁠bring production of the Chevrolet Equinox SUV ​to the same Kansas City-area plant, from ​a factory in Mexico. GM recently began production of the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt out of the plant for a limited run.\n\nWhen ‍production of the ⁠Bolt ends, GM will convert the plant to make only combustion-engine vehicles.

    "description": "An oil shock, disruptions from China, and NATO conflicts are among BCA's list of unlikely but plausible events that would slam markets in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Oil prices soaring, the world economy falling into a recession, and the NATO alliance dissolving top the list of one research firm's possible black swan events in 2026.\n\nAnalysts at BCA Research listed five unlikely but plausible scenarios that could derail markets in 2026. In a note to clients, the firm said its annual list of potential black swans was slightly different this year and addressed only \"the most important\" risks, given that there are several black swan threats investors are discussing \"ad nauseam.\"\n\n\"It is a sign of the times that white swans are now in the minority,\" a team led by Matt Gertken, the chief geopolitical and US political strategist at the firm, wrote.\n\nHere's what the firm thinks are the five biggest outlier threats facing markets this year:\n\nOil prices could spiral if the Iranian government collapses. It is a possible event that would jeopardize a significant portion of the world's oil supply, and the inflationary impact of that shock could send the world economy into a recession, the firm speculated.\n\nBCA pointed to recent geopolitical tensions surrounding Iran and estimated there is a roughly 38% chance of a \"massive\" oil supply shock stemming from upheavals in the country. The estimated probability of a \"minor\" oil supply shock is 40%.\n\nA geopolitical shock in the Middle East usually causes crude prices to rise 3% over a month and 10% over three months, according to a historical analysis from BCA.\n\n\"But a real Iran shock would be much bigger than average,\" the firm wrote.\n\nThe strategists acknowledged that President Donald Trump is seeking to avoid an oil supply shock amid pressure from the coming midterm elections. Iran is also incentivized to \"leave oil alone\" in order to avoid attacks from other nations, which should prevent a shock, they said.\n\nThe world's inventory of oil also remains \"substantial\" at around 8 billion barrels, according to estimates from BCA's commodities and energy team.\n\nThe stock market could be in for another bout of turmoil similar to last year's stunning reveal of China's lower-cost AI model if the country pulls ahead of the US in the tech arms race.\n\nChina already spends more on research and development compared to the European Union. Patent applications in the nation also outpace applications in the US, Europe, South Korea, and Japan, BCA said, citing data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\nA technological breakthrough in Beijing could hit stock prices elsewhere around the world, BCA said. The firm pointed to the DeepSeek-fueled sell-off that erased $1 trillion $1 trillion from US stocks last year.\n\n\"This episode could happen again,\" BCA wrote.\n\nShould China make more progress on the AI front, OpenAI, ChatGPT's parent, could see its valuation \"evaporate,\" the firm said.\n\nStrategists later added that they saw a 50% chance of the tech bubble bursting this year.\n\nChina could become economically self-sufficient, removing a key constraint that prevents the country from escalating military conflict related to Taiwan, BCA suggested.\n\nThe firm estimated there is a 39% probability that tensions between China and Taiwan would escalate this year. They also saw a 25% probability that tensions could break out in a proxy war, and a 7% probability that tensions could break out into a major war.\n\n\"What if China reaches technological self-sufficiency so that it can pursue a maximalist policy abroad?\" strategists wrote. \"If China falls deeper into demographic decline, debt-deflation, and dictatorship, then its powers have already peaked and its best chance for creating a sphere of influence is now.\"\n\nChina's economic statistics, like its industrial production, suggest that the nation is not preparing for war at the moment, the firm noted.\n\n\"It is not flashing red, at least not yet,\" the firm said of risk factors that could lead to military conflict.\n\nRussia could seize territory from a NATO member, sparking military conflict between Russia and the alliance. In the worst-case scenario, Russia could make nuclear threats against NATO, and the US may need to step in to \"restore the 'balance of terror,'\" strategists speculated.\n\nThe firm estimated there is a 10% probability of a Russia-NATO war.\n\n\"Russia is currently engaged in a campaign to sabotage Europe's critical infrastructure. The US's lack of solidarity with the allies could encourage overreach. Russia could take its provocations too far,\" the BCA wrote.\n\nWhile the firm said it expects Russia to reach a ceasefire with Ukraine this year, it also pointed to the risk that Trump could provide Ukraine with new military support and funding, which could lead Moscow to become more aggressive in its war with Kyiv.\n\n\"Russia, endangered by the new demands of a longer war against a superior opponent, and having missed the chance to negotiate a favorable ceasefire, could become desperate and even more dangerous,\" the firm added.\n\nShould Russia attack another NATO nation and the US doesn't come to their defense, the alliance would become a \"dead letter,\" BCA said.\n\nAlternatively, the US could also invade Greenland and cause the alliance to dissolve, the firm said, though Trump ruled out using military force to acquire the territory.\n\nBCA said it doubted either scenario would occur, but pegged a 30% probability that the US could harm NATO in some way.\n\n\"The president is determined to seize Greenland at any cost, and to insist on the full extent of his constitutional power as executive and commander-in-chief, then obviously he could conquer Greenland, to hell with the consequences,\" strategists wrote.",

Earlier on social media he said \"China has lifted market access for Canadian beef.\"\n\nChina's customs agency did not immediately respond to a request ‍for comment.\n\nThe move is not expected to have an immediate major impact on Canadian beef exports or prices because North America has a shortage of domestic beef and prices are historically high.\n\nSylvain Charlebois, a ​food market expert known as The Food Professor, said: \"China reopening or expanding access for ‌Canadian beef won't move food prices in Canada in any meaningful way.\n\n\"The volumes involved are relatively small, and Canada simply doesn't have the scale to divert large amounts of beef away from the domestic market without disrupting other exports first.\"\n\nHowever, China is an important market for certain cuts of beef, so the reopening is important for Canadian farmers and ⁠beef exporters.\n\nBeef market analyst Jerry Klassen said: \"It's very important ​for Canadian beef farmers to have access to as ​many markets as possible. The Chinese market is very important because it has potential for significant growth.\"\n\nKlassen and the Canadian Cattle Association said the ‍details on the reopening ⁠were not yet available, so the full implications would only be understood once they were. However the association celebrated the resumption of trade.\n\nChina was Canada's fourth largest ⁠beef market in 2021, before being suspended in December of that year.\n\nChina can be a vital export market ‌for Canada when North America has a beef surplus and domestic prices ‌are low.",

    "description": "The government is in crisis mode.",
    "fullText": "For many decades, the Chinese government attempted to limit population growth through a one-child policy — only to abolish the rule in 2016 as it realized that the number of annual births had started to plummet at alarming levels.\n\nThe aggressive policy — alongside other extreme measures — succeeded far too well, with birth rates dropping a staggering 17 percent between 2024 and 2025 to the lowest level since 1949. The country’s population is now actively shrinking each year, and it’s hard to imagine how the trend could be reversed.\n\nThe situation has gotten so dire that Beijing eliminated tax incentives on condoms, hormonal birth control, and other contraceptives, as Fortune reports. Basically, it’s now desperately trying to reverse itself out of a fertility crisis of its own doing. President Xi Jinping has practically been pleading with the country’s women to bear more children.\n\nYet fewer and fewer women thereare interested in raising a family, sending China well below the “replacement rate” of 2.1 children per woman, meaning the government’s interventions are doing little to address the issue. Many countries around the world, including most of North and South America, and Europe, are already experiencing below-replacement fertility rates. The situation playing out in China is a preview for what’s still to come in many other regions projected to experience a similar decline.\n\n“The empirical evidence from other countries so far is that monetary incentives have almost no effect in raising fertility,” University of California professor of sociology Wang Feng told the New York Times.\n\nDespite its economy growing by five percent last year, over 11 million people died while only 7.92 million babies were born. Meanwhile, a hot new app is trending in China that takes the form of a countdown timer that has to be reset regularly by single people so that their friends and family will know if they die alone.\n\nThe number of working-age people is also dropping as the population continues to age, further taxing healthcare systems and pension funds. The major drop in the fertility rate will continue to have devastating effects, shifting demographics that could result in a worsening economic outlook. The cost of raising a child in China is still extremely high compared to other countries.\n\n“With China’s economic woes, young people may want to wait and see, and that’s not good news for raising fertility,” Wang told the NYT.\n\nIn short, whether taxes on contraceptives and Xi’s calls for a “new type of marriage and childbearing culture” will reverse China’s plummeting birthrate remains unclear at best.\n\nThe country’s population has been shrinking since 2022, and judging by the latest numbers, the trend is bound to continue. And as the population continues to age, hundreds of millions could soon be leaving the workforce — a demographic crisis and ticking time bomb in one.\n\nMore on China’s population: Hot New App Makes Single People Check in Constantly in Case They Die Alone",

    "description": "A new report warns the U.S. could lose the ability to sustain combat within weeks of a China war over Taiwan, as munitions run dry, logistics collapse and global markets face a $10T shock.",
    "fullText": "FIRST ON FOX: The Trump administration asked for redactions to a sweeping new Heritage Foundation report modeling a potential U.S.–China war over Taiwan, even though the analysis relied entirely on publicly available, unclassified data, according to the report’s authors.\n\nThe redacted report, TIDALWAVE, warns that the United States could reach a breaking point within weeks of a high‑intensity conflict with China — conclusions that the authors say prompted senior national security officials to seek redactions over concerns adversaries could exploit the findings or use them to identify U.S. and allied military vulnerabilities.\n\nThose conclusions include warnings that U.S. forces would culminate far sooner than China, suffer catastrophic losses to aircraft and sustainment infrastructure in the Pacific, and still fail to prevent a global economic shock estimated at roughly $10 trillion, nearly a tenth of global GDP.\n\nSKIES AT STAKE: INSIDE THE US-CHINA RACE FOR AIR DOMINANCE\n\nAccording to the report's authors, the AI‑enabled model drew exclusively on open‑source government, academic, industry and commercial information. An unredacted version of the report was provided to authorized U.S. government recipients for internal use.\n\nUnlike traditional tabletop war games, TIDALWAVE employs an AI‑enabled model that runs thousands of iterations, tracking how losses in platforms, munitions, and fuel compound over time and drive cascading operational failure early in the conflict.\n\nAccording to a Heritage spokesperson, the report had been shown to \"high-level national security officials\" who requested some of the specifics be crossed out in black ink before its release to the public. The report still details how quickly U.S. forces could reach a breaking point and why the conflict would carry global consequences.\n\n\"Redactions were made at the request of the U.S. government to prevent disclosure of information that could reasonably enable an adversary to (1) re mediate or ‘close’ critical vulnerabilities that the United States and its allies could otherwise exploit, or (2) identify or exploit U.S. and allied vulnerabilities in ways that could degrade operational endurance, resilience, or deterrence,\" the report said.\n\nA Department of War spokesperson declined to comment on discussions surrounding TIDALWAVE's publication, but added: \"The Department of War does not endorse, validate, or adjudicate third-party analyses, nor do we engage publicly on hypothetical conflict modeling. As a general matter, we take seriously the protection of information that, if aggregated or contextualized, could have implications for operational security.\"\n\nThe White House could not be reached for comment.\n\nAccording to the report’s redacted findings, the U.S. would culminate in less than half the time required for the People's Republic of China in a high-intensity conflict. Culmination is defined as the point at which a force becomes incapable of continuing operations due to the loss of platforms, ammunition and/or fuel.\n\nThe report is explicit that the first 30 days to 60 days of a U.S.-China war determine its long-term shape and outcome, as early losses in aircraft, ships, fuel throughput and munitions rapidly compound and cannot be recovered on operationally relevant timelines.\n\nThe report concludes that the U.S. is not equipped nor arrayed to protect and sustain the Joint Force in a conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific. Rapid platform attrition, brittle logistics, concentrated basing and insufficient industrial surge capacity combine to force an early operational breaking point for American forces.\n\nThe report warns that U.S. reliance on a few large, concentrated forward bases — particularly in Japan and Guam — leaves American airpower dangerously exposed to Chinese missile forces.\n\nIn multiple scenarios, up to 90% of U.S. and allied aircraft positioned at major forward bases are destroyed on the ground during the opening phase of the conflict, as runways, fuel depots, command facilities and parked aircraft are hit simultaneously.\n\nThe report finds that critical U.S. precision‑guided munitions — including long‑range anti‑ship missiles, air‑to‑air interceptors and missile‑defense systems — begin to be unavailable within five to seven days of major combat operations. Across most scenarios, those critical munitions are completely exhausted within 35 days to 40 days, leaving U.S. forces unable to sustain high‑tempo combat.\n\nFuel emerges as the most decisive vulnerability of all. The report makes a critical distinction: the U.S. does not run out of fuel in most scenarios — it loses the ability to move fuel under fire.\n\nCHINA’S MISSILE SURGE PUTS EVERY US BASE IN THE PACIFIC AT RISK — AND THE WINDOW TO RESPOND IS CLOSING\n\nChinese doctrine explicitly prioritizes attacks on logistics vessels, ports, pipelines and replenishment tankers. Even limited tanker losses, port disruptions or pipeline severance are sufficient to drive fuel throughput below survivable levels, forcing commanders to sharply curtail air and naval operations despite fuel remaining in aggregate stockpiles.\n\nChinese ammunition stockpiles of critical munitions begin to be depleted after approximately 20 days to 30 days of major combat operations. However, substitution effects extend China’s ability to sustain combat operations out to months — well beyond the point at which U.S. forces culminate, according to the report.\n\nThe consequences extend far beyond the battlefield.\n\nThe redacted report concludes the U.S. is highly unlikely to prevent massive global economic fallout once a Taiwan conflict begins.\n\nDisruption of shipping lanes, destruction of critical infrastructure and the collapse of Taiwan’s semiconductor production would trigger a global economic shock estimated at roughly $10 trillion, with enduring ripple effects across financial markets, manufacturing and global trade.\n\nThe report comes amid years of concern over U.S. military readiness and industrial capacity, as China rapidly expands its naval forces and shipbuilding base.\n\nThe U.S. Navy operates a smaller fleet than planned, while American shipyards face workforce shortages, aging infrastructure and chronic delays — even as China, the world’s largest shipbuilder, continues to outpace the U.S. in producing new naval hulls.\n\nWar Secretary Pete Hegseth and other military leaders have vowed to put the Pentagon on a wartime footing for industrial capacity.\n\nPerhaps most alarming, TIDALWAVE warns that the scale of losses in the Indo‑Pacific would leave the U.S. unable to deter or respond effectively to a second major conflict elsewhere in the world.\n\nA war over Taiwan could open the door to follow‑on aggression by adversaries such as Russia, Iran or North Korea, fundamentally destabilizing the global security order.\n\nThe report is blunt in its assessment: existing Pentagon programs and congressional funding are too slow, too fragmented and too modest to address the scale of the challenge. In many cases, the timeline required to fix critical vulnerabilities exceeds the likely timeline to conflict.\n\nTo avoid what the authors describe as a strategic defeat, the report urges Congress to immediately expand munitions stockpiles, strengthen fuel reserves and distribution infrastructure, harden and disperse forward bases, and accelerate sustainment and logistics reforms. Without rapid action, the authors warn, the U.S. risks entering a conflict it is structurally unprepared to fight or sustain.\n\nWith intelligence warnings mounting that China could move on Taiwan before the end of the decade, TIDALWAVE cautions that the window to correct these deficiencies may be closing faster than Washington is prepared to act.",

    "fullText": "The global EV transition has a policy problem, says BYD executive vice president Stella Li.\n\nLi said in a panel session on EVs on the second day at Davos that governments keep changing the rules about EVs. The stop-start approach makes it harder for automakers to commit capital, plan product cycles, or build supply chains with confidence, even as competition across the EV markets in China, the US, and Europe heats up.\n\nLi said that when countries go \"back and forth\" on their EV policy, it creates a pattern that \"will confuse manufacturers.\"\n\nIn contrast, when governments give a \"very clear line,\" automakers can focus on execution, Li said.\n\nThat inconsistency has real consequences, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said on the same panel.\n\n\"The back and forth policies at the national level have made it more difficult for industry to throw all in and ramp up the way that some of the Chinese companies have been able to,\" she added.\n\nElaine Buckberg, former chief economist at General Motors, said on the panel that automakers typically plan vehicles five years before launch and expect to sell them for years afterward. Stable, long-term regulations are critical for companies expanding into EVs.\n\n\"Keeping those incentives stable, that's really powerful,\" she said. \"That's a place where the US is really pulling back under the Trump administration.\"\n\nChina has a clear lead over the US in electric vehicles, Li and two of her co-panelists said.\n\nLi said consumer demand, rapidly improving technology, and China's dense charging network are accelerating adoption and making EVs a practical choice for everyday drivers.\n\nIn China, EVs are not only bringing a \"sustainable future,\" but also bringing \"innovation,\" Li said.\n\nIndustry leaders have been vocal about China's dominance in the global EV market.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley said in an episode of The Verge's \"Decoder\" podcast in September that \"the Chinese are the 700-pound gorilla in the EV industry.\"\n\n\"There's no real competition from Tesla, GM, or Ford with what we've seen from China. It is completely dominating the EV landscape globally and more and more outside of China,\" he added.\n\nFarley said that China has \"great innovation at a very low cost,\" and that companies have \"huge subsidies\" and are sponsored by their local governments.\n\nChina's government poured at least $230 billion into supporting domestic EV makers between 2009 and 2023, according to a 2024 report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\"There's no secret magic thing that you're like, 'Oh, aha, they did this.' But rather it's the compounding benefits of a lower cost of capital,\" said Rivian's CEO, RJ Scaringe, in an episode of the \"Everything Electric\" podcast published in September.",

    "fullText": "MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. announced Monday the discovery of a new natural gas deposit near the disputed South China Sea, which could shield his country from a potential power crisis.\n\nThe “significant discovery\" northwest off Palawan province, close to an existing gas field in waters adjacent to the critical waterway, could eventually supply power to more than 5.7 million households or nearly 200,000 schools for a year, Marcos said, adding further tests and another drilling in the area would be done “to pursue more potential gas resources.\"\n\nThe undersea reservoir is estimated to contain about 98 billion cubic feet (2.7 billion cubic meters) of gas. Initial tests showed 60 million cubic feet (1.6 million cubic meters) of gas could be extracted daily from the well, Marcos said, without providing further details, including when commercial production could start.\n\n“This helps Malampaya’s contribution and strengthens our domestic gas supply for many years to come,” Marcos said. “Aside from the natural gas, the discovery also includes condensate, which is a high-value liquid fuel.”\n\nThe new gas deposit, called Malampaya East 1, was discovered by a consortium about 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) east of the main Malampaya gas field, where commercial gas production started more than two decades ago and was projected to considerably decline in a few years.\n\n“We're proud that Filipinos led this drilling and, more importantly, they completed it without any accident or environmental incidents,” Marcos said.\n\nThe Malampaya gas-to-power facility has generated more than 20% of Luzon's electricity, the most populous northern Philippine island region. In 2023, Marcos extended an exploration contract in Malampaya by 15 years.\n\nExperts have predicted Malampaya could run out of gas in a few years, sparking fears of a potential power crisis in Luzon, where the bustling capital and main financial and business district is located.\n\nThe offshore gas field lies within the country’s Exclusive Economic Zone of the Philippines, a 200-nautical-mile (370-kilometer) stretch of water from a country’s coastline where it has exclusive rights to explore and harness resources under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\n\nPhilippine efforts to explore for oil and gas in another offshore region, the Reed Bank, have been stalled for years because of opposition from Beijing, which claims sovereignty over the area along with most of the South China Sea. The Reed Bank also lies in the fringes of the South China Sea west of the Philippine island province of Palawan.\n\nChina has opposed Vietnam’s oil and gas exploration in the disputed region. Beijing claims virtually the entire South China Sea and has reinforced its presence, including coast guard and naval patrols in the disputed waterway in recent years.\n\nMalaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have also been involved in the region's long-simmering territorial standoffs.",

    "description": "China faces a shrinking population and record-low birth rates, challenging economic growth and straining pensions and healthcare.",
    "fullText": "China's population is shrinking — and the decline is accelerating.\n\nThe country's population fell for the fourth year in a row, falling by 3.39 million to 1.405 billion people in 2025, according to new data from China's National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nIts birth rate hit its lowest level on record — 5.63 per 1,000 people — since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, while the death rate climbed to 8.04 per 1,000 people. The number of babies born in the country dropped to 7.92 million, down from 9.54 million in 2024.\n\nThe United Nations predicted in 2024 that China's population could fall as low as 663 million — less than half its current population — by 2100, if birth rates continue to decline and immigration stays low.\n\nIf things don't change, China's shrinking and aging population poses serious long-term risks for the country's economy. It could mean a much smaller workforce, weaker demand for goods and services such as housing, and mounting pressure on pension and healthcare systems. A smaller working-age population in China could also hurt the global economy, which has relied on China's booming productivity and economic growth.\n\nChina reported that its economy grew by 5% last year, meeting its official growth target. The country also logged a record trade surplus in 2025, despite President Donald Trump's tariffs. However, it's struggling with soaring unemployment among young people and an ongoing oversupply of housing, which has tanked property values, hurting consumer spending and slowing investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, and real estate.\n\nThe population of mainland China began shrinking in 2022, when it declined by 850,000 people after years of falling birth rates. That year marked the first time the country's population had declined since a major famine killed an estimated 30 million people during Mao Zedong's failed Great Leap Forward in the early 1960s.\n\nChina's demographic challenges have unfolded faster than the government once anticipated. The government has loosened previous restrictions to counter the effect, dropping the one-child policy a decade ago to allow families to have two children. Five years ago, it began allowing three children.\n\nIn recent years, the government has raced to lift the fertility rate by offering financial incentives to parents, tightening access to abortions, and, more recently, imposing new taxes on contraceptives, including birth control and condoms. There is little evidence these efforts have been successful at lifting birth rates.\n\nThough its situation is serious, China is far from alone in declining fertility. Birth rates are falling in countries around the world, particularly in higher-income nations, including the US. Fertility rates below the \"replacement rate\" of 2.1 births per woman are \"becoming the global norm,\" according to a report by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. This has sparked similar economic concerns about a shrinking workforce and a growing elderly population.\n\nThe US has a slightly rosier population forecast than other major economies, as it's set to grow slightly due to immigration.",

    "fullText": "The next stop on Donald Trump’s world tour—or takeover—may be America’s northern neighbor.\n\nThe president, 79, has turned his attention toward Canada, fixating on what he sees as vulnerabilities along its northern border that could be exploited by U.S. adversaries Russia or China, two U.S. officials, a senior administration official, and three former senior U.S. officials told NBC News.\n\n“They certainly need to up their game when it comes to Arctic capabilities,” one official told the outlet, adding that Canada’s northern border “is not acceptable given today’s threats” and that “the status quo is not enough.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about what he views as Canada’s weak defenses, sparking conversations with Canadian officials about a broader Arctic security strategy, NBC reported. Among the initiatives that have caught Trump’s interest are expanded U.S. maritime patrols and the purchase of additional icebreakers—specialized ships designed to operate in ice-covered waters—operating in or around Canadian territory.\n\n“Trump is really worried about the U.S. continuing to drift in the Western Hemisphere and is focused on this,” one official told NBC.\n\nThey added: “At the end of the day, this is to stop Russia and China from having a further presence in the Arctic.”\n\nWith 3.85 million square miles and 40 million residents, Canada is the largest target on Trump’s growing list of potential land grabs.\n\nThe conversations come as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Friday, signaling an effort to deepen ties between the two countries. Carney became the first Canadian leader to visit China since 2017.\n\nTrump’s fixation on Canada, aides say, is part of a broader effort to “solidify” the Western Hemisphere—and falls in line with his aggressive campaign to acquire Greenland, the semiautonomous Danish territory.\n\n“Canada stands to benefit from the U.S. having Greenland,” one administration official said.\n\nCarney on Friday voiced support for Denmark’s NATO membership and said Greenland—home to roughly 57,000 residents and located northeast of Canada—should determine its own future.\n\nTrump’s increasingly frequent assertions that “We do need Greenland, absolutely,” for defense purposes, have rattled Denmark, whose leaders have repeatedly warned they will not give up the world’s largest island, and that an American takeover would end NATO.\n\nWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller asserted on Saturday that under “the law,” nations were not entitled to their territory if they were unable to defend it. The Trump aide belittled the Danish government, saying its “tiny” military was failing to adequately protect Greenland.\n\n“With respect to Denmark, Denmark is a tiny country with a tiny economy, and a tiny military,” Miller said of Fox’s Hannity.\n\n“They cannot defend Greenland. They cannot control the territory of Greenland. Under every understanding of law that has existed about territorial control for 500 years, to control a territory you have to be able to defend a territory, improve territory, inhabit a territory. Denmark has failed on every single one of these tests.”\n\nMeanwhile, officials told NBC that the White House has voiced similar criticisms of Canada, which has increased its defense spending but continues to fall short of NATO’s goal.\n\n“The world doesn’t see Canada as a major force when it comes to defense,” the official told NBC.\n\nTrump has previously said “it’s highly unlikely” he would use military force against Canada. But after his shock invasion of Venezuela and the abduction of then-President Nicholas Maduro on Jan. 3., the president has not ruled out deploying U.S. military troops to countries including Colombia, U.S. ally Mexico, and Greenland.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House and to Carney’s representatives for comment.",

    "fullText": "Designing a Formula 1 engine has helped Ford gain the edge against Chinese cars, Ford's CEO Jim Farley said.\n\nFord announced in 2023 that it would supply Oracle Red Bull Racing with its engines from 2026. On Friday, Red Bull unveiled its car for the 2026 Formula 1 season, powered by the Red Bull Ford Powertrains engine.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg published on Sunday, Farley was asked how developing the engine has helped him deliver better value for his customers.\n\n\"It's a long list, but I would say the real signature for me is really the software — the control software for the hybrid system, predictive failure components,\" Farley said.\n\nAnd designing better software is a key step to beating Chinese cars, he said.\n\n\"These are the essence of the new software-defined vehicle globally to beat China, and they are really good,\" he added. \"We need these capabilities from Formula 1, and we can put them right in the Transit van.\"\n\nWorking on the F1 engine with Red Bull has helped Ford understand LLMs and predict component failures, which can benefit both Red Bull driver Max Verstappen and Ford's customers.\n\nThis is not Ford's first foray into F1. It supplied engines for the race from 1967 until 2004.\n\nFarley has, on several occasions, gushed about the tech capabilities of China's automobiles. In October 2024, he said he had been driving an EV from the Chinese tech giant Xiaomi for half a year and didn't want to give it up.\n\nAnd in July, speaking at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Farley said, \"They have far superior in-vehicle technology,\" citing Xiaomi's phone-to-car pairing capabilities.\n\nChinese automobile companies, particularly EV makers, have gone all in on smart technology in recent years. An executive of CATL, a Chinese EV battery manufacturer, said during the World Economic Forum last year that China's automakers were retiring the traditional term \"EVs\" in favor of \"EIVs,\" or electric intelligent vehicles.\n\nAnd after the Chinese AI company DeepSeek launched its R1 model last year, major automakers like BYD, Geely, and Great Wall Motor said they would integrate it into their cars.",

    "fullText": "China is now a key market for global carmakers, and, surprisingly, buyers there are shifting back to sedans that offer serious tech. Automakers are pushing boundaries to get noticed, and Nissan is one of them. The brand launched two new electrified sedans and a refreshed Teana late last year – the latter being the more premium take on the Altima sold in the US.\n\nThe new Teana, built by Dongfeng Nissan, puts a big emphasis on tech and interior quality. It looks a class above what you’d expect from an Altima-based sedan. Part of that comes from a glowing AI speaker on the dash, but the real surprise is the material choice. Nissan worked with Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (MCC) to use Durabio, a plant-based plastic that looks and feels closer to crystal than the usual trim.\n\nIn China, buyers care about big screens, lighting, and how upscale a car feels. The Teana’s interior is built to make a strong first impression, and it stands out even more when you see it lit up at night.\n\nDurabio is more than just a marketing fluff. MCC developed it as a bio-based plastic using plant-derived isosorbide. It’s clearer and handles light better than regular polycarbonate, which helps create lighting that looks deep and high-end instead of cheap or artificial.\n\nOn the Teana, Durabio is used for the inverted-pyramid AI speaker that lights up with six pillars glowing in up to 256 colors. The material refracts light cleanly, giving it a crystal-like look without needing a clear coat. That saves manufacturing steps, lowers environmental footprint, and still meets automotive durability standards.\n\nTeana runs a Huawei-based operating system to go with Durabio. The end result is an interior that feels modern and thoughtfully put together (at least visually), not just a quick update.\n\nMeanwhile, the US-market Altima heads into 2026 with almost no changes from last year. It remains affordable and practical, but next to the Teana, it comes across as very restrained. Nissan still sells a lot of sedans in the US, with over 255,000 units last year (out of the brand's over 760,000-unit sales), but the Altima’s own sales dropped to 93,268 in 2025, down 18 percent from the year before.\n\nThat drop probably comes from the Altima’s age. The current model dates back to 2018, with its last big update in 2022. It no longer stands out for design or interior appeal. After seeing what Nissan has done with the Teana, it’s fair to ask (hope, even) if a more upscale, more distinctive Altima could bring buyers back to the midsize sedan segment.\n\nFor now, there’s no clear answer. But with China getting the more ambitious upgrades, it’s easy to see how a bit of that Durabio-inspired thinking could only help the Altima.\n\nView the 9 images of this gallery on the original article",

    "fullText": "At the start of 2025, alarms were blaring about the risk of investing in China.\n\nA new protectionist administration was taking over in the US at the same time China's domestic real estate market was teetering. A possible US ban on TikTok, the popular social media app, imperiled ByteDance, one of the country's biggest tech companies. American companies seemed to have surged ahead of Chinese rivals in artificial intelligence development.\n\nTwelve months later, and many of the biggest fears appear to be overblown. The Chinese government has focused on stimulating the economy, leading public companies to significantly increase their buybacks. ByteDance sold a majority stake in its US TikTok operations and is now more valuable than ever, with HSG, the venture capital firm formerly known as Sequoia China, valuing the company at between $350 billion and $370 billion recently. And China's AI scene, led by startup DeepSeek, is keeping pace with Western peers, and Nvidia will be permitted to sell its powerful H200 chips to Chinese companies, the US government said Tuesday.\n\nHedge funds willing to invest in the country last year were rewarded. Bridgewater, which manages $92 billion across all its strategies, generated a 34.2% return in its China Total Returns fund, a person close to the manager told Business Insider. Tekne Capital, managed by Beeneet Kothari, a onetime lieutenant of billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller, was up more than 50% last year, a person close to the manager said.\n\nKothari's $1.5 billion firm is an investor in Chinese companies such as DiDi Global, recruiting firm Kanzhun, and data-center builder GDS, the person said. Kothari told Business Insider in an interview last year that the headwinds facing the country made strong companies very cheap.\n\nAccording to HSBC's Hedge Weekly report, funds based in China and investing in the country performed well. $3.4 billion Pinpoint's China-focused strategy returned more than 24%, while its multistrategy offering, which invests across Asia, was up 11.6%. George Jiang's long-running Golden China fund made close to 33%, and Epimelis Capital, run by Hutchin Hill and Goldman Sachs veteran Fei Sun, made 35% in its China-centric strategy.\n\nThe average China-focused fund was up close to 18%, according to Hedge Fund Research, outpacing the industry average of 10.7%.\n\nGoing into 2026, investors will be watching how the volatile relationship between the US and China evolves, especially around trade agreements connected to chips, as well as any indication that China might invade Taiwan.\n\nByteDance will also be a focus for funds — Tiger Global and Coatue are both backers — as the social media giant continues to grow.",

    "fullText": "Nvidia's (NVDA) China business continues to face geopolitical hurdles, which could pose longer-term competitive risks for the AI chipmaker.\n\nOngoing US-China tensions have upended Nvidia’s sales in what was one of its largest markets. In the company’s most recent quarter, revenue from China, which includes Hong Kong, dropped 45% from a year ago to about $3 billion, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nAnd while the Trump administration green-lighted the sale of Nvidia’s H200 chip to China this week, albeit with a 25% tax, Reuters reported that China is barring imports of the GPUs except in special cases.\n\nSo far, Nvidia's dominant position in the chip market doesn't appear to have suffered much after the company initially lost access to the Chinese AI market in 2025. It became the first company with a $5 trillion valuation last fall. Despite a decline in China sales, its third quarter revenue overall soared more than 60% during the period to about $57 billion.\n\nBut over the long term, the Chinese commercial sector’s development and use of domestic chips could narrow Nvidia’s lead on the global stage, Wall Street analysts told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThey said Nvidia's dominance in AI software could suffer if Chinese tech developers begin making advances in open source alternatives, which would hurt its leadership in hardware as well.\n\n“That's the real nightmare scenario,” Seaport analyst Jay Goldberg said.\n\nMuch of Nvidia’s competitive edge comes from its software stack. Developers using its AI systems rely on the company’s CUDA platform, which includes a library of proprietary tools that lets them program its GPUs efficiently and reinforces the company’s dominance in the chip market.\n\nAs companies build on CUDA, the cost of switching to a new software platform becomes disadvantageous, and they end up sticking with Nvidia’s offerings, which are only available if developers are programming on Nvidia's GPUs. Hence, the preference for Nvidia's software is key to maintaining its lead in the hardware space.\n\nWhile China’s chip suppliers — from tech giants Huawei and Alibaba (BABA) to newly public players such as Moore Threads and MetaX — lag Nvidia in the performance capabilities of their chips, there’s a risk that the country’s AI developers, forced to use those inferior, domestically-produced chips, will build their own open-source software. Open-source AI software is typically written to run on many different types of chips.",

    "fullText": "As a viral app sparks debate about solo living in China, new Census Bureau data shows that the share of one-person households in the US is reaching record highs.\n\nA new app has risen to the top of China’s iPhone App Store charts — one markedly more macabre than the messaging platforms and AI assistants that typically lead the ranking.\n\nOn Monday, media outlets reported that the viral app Sile Me (which roughly translates from Mandarin as a very literal “Are You Dead?”) had become the country’s most popular paid Apple App Store download.\n\nLaunched in mid-2025 and costing a mere 8 yuan ($1.15) to buy, Sile Me offers just one function: a large button that users can press to confirm that they are, in fact, alive. If they fail to do so for two consecutive days, the app will reach out to an appointed emergency contact.\n\nWhile the app’s simplicity is reminiscent of some earlier patrons of the App Store, its sudden popularity is putting the spotlight on the growing cohort of solo dwellers in the Eastern nation.\n\nResearch suggests that there could be as many as 200 million one-person households in China by 2030 — and while a rapidly aging population explains some of that rise, younger people now also appear to be embracing living alone.\n\nIn America, it’s no different. Data from the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey for 2025 reveals that the number of one-person households in the US is edging close to a record 40 million, with the share of American households made up of just one person hitting an all-time high of 29%.\n\nThis includes an estimated ~1.3 million extra one-person households in 2025 compared with the prior year, though the Bureau noted that this may be reflective of both demographic changes and methodological updates. Even so, the significant rise over the last decade indicates a broader societal shift that’s been playing out around the globe.\n\nAs noted by The Economist in November, the share of people living alone has increased in 26 out of 30 rich countries since 2010.\n\nMarriage rates are continuing to plummet in the US, as well as in China and many other developed nations, which has coincided with rising incomes and some heated online discourse about traditional relationships. And, like China, the surge in solo dwellings is also being driven at the older end of the demographic spectrum: America’s population aged 65 and older, statistically the most likely cohort to live alone, is expected to keep booming.",

    "description": "Greenland's natural resources and proximity to Russia and China have made it a valuable strategic asset to the US military since World War II.",
    "fullText": "Visitors to Pituffik Space Base in Greenland are greeted by a sign welcoming them to the \"top of the world.\"\n\nAs the US military's northernmost installation, Pituffik Space Base's operations include scientific research, space surveillance, and missile detection.\n\nGreenland's abundant natural resources and proximity to Russia and China have made it a valuable strategic asset since World War II — so much so that US President Donald Trump has often expressed his intent to purchase the autonomous Danish territory.\n\nVice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance visited the military base in March 2025 amid rising tensions between the US, Denmark, and Greenland.\n\nThose tensions have continued to flare as Trump has refused to rule out the use of military force to take control of Greenland. In a Truth Social post on Wednesday, Trump wrote that the US \"needs Greenland\" and \"anything less than that is unacceptable.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Denmark increased its military presence in Greenland, citing \"security tensions.\" Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio also met with the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland on Wednesday.\n\nHere's a look inside Greenland's only US military base.\n\nTrump first expressed interest in buying Greenland, the world's largest island and an autonomous Danish territory, during his first presidency. In addition to being rich in natural resources, Greenland's Arctic location is well-placed to further US interests by countering China and Russia.\n\nSince his reelection, Trump has repeatedly conveyed his desire to acquire Greenland and said he would not rule out the use of military force to take it.\n\n\"We need Greenland for national security. One way or the other we're going to get it,\" he said in his joint address to Congress in March 2025.\n\nBoth Denmark and Greenland's leaders have maintained that the island is not for sale.\n\nSecond lady Usha Vance was originally scheduled to visit Greenland on a solo trip in 2025 to \"visit historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersua, Greenland's national dogsled race,\" the White House said.\n\nInstead, the trip was scaled back. The vice president and second lady visited Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, the US military's northernmost installation, in March.\n\nUsha Vance's solo trip could have violated diplomatic protocol by sending a delegation to another country without an invitation. The amended plan — visiting a US base — avoided that potential violation. While Trump said that \"people from Greenland are asking us to go there,\" the government of Greenland said they had not invited any foreign delegations to visit.\n\n\"Just for the record, Naalakkersuisut, the government of Greenland, has not extended any invitations for any visits, neither private nor official,\" the government's official Facebook page wrote in a post on Monday.\n\nGreenland's then-prime minister, Múte Bourup Egede, also called Usha Vance's planned trip \"very aggressive\" in an interview with Sermitsiaq, a Greenlandic newspaper.\n\nTaylor Van Kirk, JD Vance's press secretary, told Business Insider at the time that the vice president and second lady were \"proud\" to visit the US military base in Greenland.\n\n\"As the vice president has said, previous US leaders have neglected Arctic security, while Greenland's Danish rulers have neglected their security obligations to the island. The security of Greenland is critical in ensuring the security of the rest of the world, and the Vice President looks forward to learning more about the island.\"\n\nWhile the US doesn't own Greenland, it has had a military presence there since World War II.\n\nPituffik Space Base, originally named Thule Air Base, was formally established in 1951 as part of a Cold War-era defense treaty between the US and Denmark. It is located in Pituffik, Greenland, 750 miles north of the Arctic Circle and halfway between New York and Moscow.\n\nAs a Danish territory, Greenland does not have a military of its own.\n\nAs the Pentagon's northernmost military base, Pituffik Space Base acts as a key Arctic defense outpost. Because of its location on the \"top of the world,\" it is an optimal vantage point for monitoring missile launches by US adversaries like Russia and establishing space superiority.\n\nThe base is the site of a phased-array radar, which can detect sea-launched and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and a surface-to-air missile system, which intercepts hostile threats.\n\nThe base has a Satellite Command and Control system to maintain real-time communications and data relay with military and intelligence satellites. Its high-altitude location also allows it to more frequently track polar-orbit satellites, which can monitor the entire Earth's surface over time as the planet rotates below them.\n\nBecause Pituffik's primary mission is space surveillance and missile warning, the space base doesn't house a permanently stationed fighter wing or naval fleet.\n\nInstead, it acts as a strategic logistics and defense hub for Arctic missions and under-ice operations. From the site, which is the world's northernmost deep-water seaport, surface vessels and submarines operated by the US Navy and allied forces conduct Arctic patrols and cold-weather training exercises.\n\nAircraft regularly fly in and out of the former air base, such as military cargo and refueling planes and maritime patrol aircraft. Occasionally, fighter jets and long-range bombers will fly to the base for Arctic deterrence deployments and training flights.\n\nWhile it doesn't have a permanent combat force, the Air Force does have one tugboat at Pituffik to support port operations, icebreaking, and maneuvering ships.\n\nA small but significant asset, the Rising Star helps keep supply routes open by breaking up and pushing floating ice. The tugboat guides supply ships through the port, making it a critical component in bringing fuel, food, and equipment to personnel year-round.\n\nHowever, since the base is locked in by ice for nine months of the year, the Rising Star gets limited use because it can only be operated when the port is completely ice-free.\n\nPituffik Space Base is surrounded by ice for nine months out of every year. The closest town, the Inuit village of Qaanaaq, is located 65 miles away.\n\nTemperatures can range from 60 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer, when there are 24 hours of daylight, to -50 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, when there is no sunlight for weeks.\n\nWinter storms are categorized into five levels from least to most severe: Normal, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, and Delta. At the Bravo level, the buddy system is implemented so that no one walks outside alone. Non-essential facilities close at the Charlie level, and personnel must shelter in place during Delta storms.\n\nAbout 150 personnel are stationed at Pituffik.\n\nThe Dundas Buffet Dining Hall on base serves three meals a day with payments accepted through a meal card.\n\nThe Base Exchange, also known as \"BX,\" sells groceries, toiletries, souvenirs, and other assorted goods. It also houses a barber shop.\n\nThere are no ATMs at Pituffik Space Base, but the Base Exchange accepts debit and credit cards as well as US dollars.\n\nPituffik Space Base features a bowling alley, a chapel, and a community center with a theater and craft room.\n\nThere's also a gymnasium and workout room stocked with weights and treadmills.\n\nPituffik Space Base's official Facebook page shows personnel participating in recreational events such as a Hawaiian-themed Arctic luau party, Greenlandic Heritage Week, and cross-country skiing.\n\nThe US built airbases and weather stations across the ice sheet during World War II as refueling stops on transatlantic flights and supply routes.\n\nTwo decommissioned airbases are now being used as civilian airports, and a third was abandoned after the war ended.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the US Air Force also built four stations on Greenland's coasts as part of a larger communication network of more than 60 radar installations to detect Soviet bombers. Most of the stations have since been deactivated, left to deteriorate atop Greenland's ice sheet.\n\nIn 2024, NASA scientists detected an underground base for a top-secret Cold War-era missile operation known as Camp Century. Now buried 100 feet under the ice, the abandoned network of subterranean tunnels once operated under the guise of an Arctic research facility before the US government declassified it in 1995.\n\nBut the abandoned military sites represent more than just relics of past global conflicts. Thousands of gallons of biological, chemical, and radioactive waste left behind on the bases pose a significant environmental threat, especially as the planet warms.\n\nThe US military failed to clean up decommissioned facilities like Camp Century, assuming the ice sheet would entomb the waste and infrastructure over the years.\n\nHowever, at the current melting rate of the Arctic, researchers estimate that the waste could resurface around 2100. The question remains as to who is responsible for cleaning up the waste from abandoned US military facilities scattered throughout Greenland.\n\nThe US has long pursued access to or control over Greenland due to its strategic and economic significance, dating back as early as the late 19th century.\n\nSince his return to the White House, Trump has continued to double down on his ambitions to secure the self-governing territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, saying he won't rule out military force or economic coercion to do so.\n\nThough the Danish government has remained steadfast in refusing the sale, Trump's so-called \"real estate deal\" has spotlighted Greenland's growing desire for independence from Denmark and disinterest in being owned by anybody, including the US.\n\n\"The time has come to stand together,\" Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said at a press conference on Tuesday, appearing with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. \"It has not been easy to stand up to completely unacceptable pressure from our closest allies for a lifetime. But there is much to suggest that the hardest part is still ahead of us.\"",

    "description": "The tariffs will allow President Trump to take a cut of Nvidia’s chip sales to China while putting off a decision about imposing higher taxes on the chip industry.",
    "fullText": "President Trump signed a proclamation on Wednesday to impose a 25 percent tariff on a narrow list of foreign semiconductors, providing a way for the government to earn revenue off the sale of lucrative chips used in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe tariff, which would take effect Thursday, is far more limited than what the president initially threatened. Last year, the administration began an investigation aimed at encouraging tech companies and chip makers to buy semiconductors made in America. But instead of approving sweeping tariffs that would affect the industry, Wednesday’s announcement showed the administration has settled for narrower levies that allow it to take a cut of artificial intelligence chips sold to China.\n\nA document released by the White House said a 25 percent tariff would be put on A.I. chips made by companies like Nvidia and AMD that are imported into the United States and then re-exported to other countries. The tariff would not apply to semiconductors that are brought into the country to be used domestically in data centers or in products for American consumers, industry or the government. But it would allow the U.S. government to collect revenue from the sale of A.I. chips to China, an idea Mr. Trump proposed last year.\n\nThe president may still impose broader tariffs on semiconductor imports and products containing them in the near future, the White House said, including a program that would provide tariff relief for companies that manufacture chips domestically.\n\nFor now, though, the arrangement will very likely be welcomed by major chip companies that have lobbied fiercely to limit the scope of any tariffs. Most chip companies manufacture the bulk of their products in Taiwan or East Asia, where many of the world’s electronics are made, and ship them into the United States only if they are to be used domestically.\n\nMr. Trump threatened last August to impose a 100 percent tariff on foreign semiconductors unless manufacturers committed to invest in the United States. But chip tariffs had the potential to rankle foreign governments, as well as many of the tech companies that have grown close with the president. The administration has been particularly cautious of disrupting a trade truce that it reached last year with China, a major manufacturer of semiconductors.\n\nThe announcement on Wednesday avoided any such impacts, while also allowing Mr. Trump to realize his plans to take a 25 percent cut of the revenue that Nvidia, the A.I. chip giant, will make from selling advanced chips to China.\n\nMr. Trump first floated the plan in August but was forbidden by U.S. law to tax exports or export licenses. So administration officials proposed a circuitous solution where they would bring Nvidia chips manufactured in Asia into the United States and impose a 25 percent tariff on the imported chip, before re-exporting the products to China.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Commerce issued a rule to permit the sale of a more advanced A.I. chip made by Nvidia, the H200, to China. Mr. Trump had banned the sale of those chips last year out of national security concerns, but abruptly reversed himself after Nvidia argued that exporting the chips was important for American global technology leadership. Nvidia’s chief executive, Jensen Huang, has become one of Mr. Trump’s closest allies in the tech world.\n\nMr. Trump started the chips inquiry under a national security-related law known as Section 232, which he has used to apply tariffs to other sectors, including a 50 percent tariff on all steel imports and a 25 percent tariff on all imported cars.\n\nThe White House also said Wednesday that it had concluded a Section 232 investigation into critical minerals, including lithium, gallium, germanium, cobalt and nickel. An executive order said the administration would refrain from putting tariffs on the sector for now.\n\nInstead, the order directed officials to negotiate trade agreements that would provide the United States more access to critical minerals, which are used in things ranging from cars to airplanes to A.I. data centers. The United States is heavily reliant on other countries — including China — for those minerals.\n\nSome analysts have questioned whether the Trump administration is backing away from heftier tariffs amid rising concerns among Americans about affordability. High prices were a key issue that helped propel Democrats to electoral wins in November. In an economic speech on Tuesday, Mr. Trump called affordability a “fake word by Democrats” but also detailed various steps his administration had taken to lower prices.\n\nBecause semiconductors are in almost everything with an on-off switch, chip companies had warned the administration that more expansive tariffs could lead to widespread price increases across the American economy.\n\nOthers have told the administration that a 25 percent surcharge on the machinery they need to manufacture chips, which can cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, would make semiconductor factories in the United States unviable.\n\nLast year, the United States imported roughly $45 billion in semiconductor chips, primarily from Taiwan and Malaysia, according to Bernstein Research.\n\nMr. Trump had said companies that have committed to building in the United States wouldn’t pay tariffs, and Commerce Department employees have been working on an arrangement that would offer tariff exemptions to companies that invest domestically. Last year, the chief executives of Apple, Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturer, pledged more than $1 trillion in U.S. investments as they sought to avoid fees.\n\nSemiconductor companies have been forced to accept uncertainty under Mr. Trump. Since returning to office, he has threatened to take away government grants, restricted chip sales to China, demanded investments and recommended that one company, Intel, fire its chief executive.\n\nThe intrusions have paralyzed an industry that less than a year earlier signed contracts with the Biden administration to release tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to build factories. Mr. Trump immediately put the industry on edge by criticizing those programs as wasteful, and had his staff ask firms for more investments before releasing the money.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has also seemed attuned to the concerns of tech C.E.O.s, particularly Mr. Huang and Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook. In April, the administration gave the technology industry a lucrative carve-out from its global tariffs, saying electronics would soon be subject to other tariffs under Section 232. No other industry has received such a broad exemption.",

    "fullText": "Venezuela's Chinese air defense radars weren't game-changing during the US raid to capture Maduro.\n\nChina has touted the effectiveness in combat of radars like its JY-27A.\n\nThe lack of effect recently raises questions about both the radar and their operators.\n\nVenezuela's military had Chinese-made anti-aircraft radars available when the US launched a surprise air assault against the country to capture the country's now-former leader, Nicolás Maduro, earlier this month. They appear to have been of little help.\n\nOperation Absolute Resolve involved over 150 US military aircraft, none of which were shot down. A helicopter was hit, reportedly by machine gun fire, but remained operational.\n\nVenezuela has a number of China's JY-27A mobile radars, which Beijing has touted as top-of-the-line systems. It has said the radar can detect stealth assets, like the American F-22 and F-35, from over 150 miles away.\n\nThe success of the surprise raid by US special operators into downtown Caracas, part of a larger mission which involved not only stealth airpower but also older fourth-generation aircraft and helicopters, suggests that something didn't go as planned on defense. That may be on the operators rather than the tech though.\n\nAfter the raid, a Japanese reporter asked a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson what Beijing thought about the \"large amount of military equipment\" China sold Venezuela apparently being \"of little practical use.\" The Chinese spokesperson responded by condemning the US strike.\n\nThe Chinese-made JY-27A is a long-range radar used for detecting and tracking hostile aircraft in protected airpsace. Introduced in 2014, the radar system consists of a radar mast with multiple antenna panels supported by separate radar and control vehicles. Chinese sources claim it has features designed to reduce jamming. A newer version, the JY-27V, has since been developed.\n\nWhen Venezuela purchased JY-27As from China last year, there were claims that the radars were able to lock onto multiple F-35B fighter jets off the Venezuelan coast, presenting a potential challenge to the one-way transparency advantage of the US military.\n\n\"That's all well and good,\" Michael Sobolik, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, told Business Insider, \"but when it really matters is in a moment of conflict.\" Perhaps they were unable to withstand sophisticated electromagnetic spectrum attacks, or maybe they were improperly utilized by their operators.

Some of these pieces are capable but aren't the newest variants used by their respective exporters.\n\nIn the aftermath, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth mocked the effectiveness of the Russian air defenses.

    "description": "Waymo plans to introduce two new vehicle  platforms to its robotaxi fleet: the Hyundai IONIQ 5 and China's Zeekr, which Waymo is branding, \"Ojai.\"",
    "fullText": "Alphabet-backed Waymo plans to add two new vehicles to its robotaxi fleet in the near future, including a roomier four-seater the company is calling the \"Ojai,\" named after a small southern California city.\n\nThe two cars will be integrated with Waymo's sixth-generation AI driver, which will have a reduced sensor suite.\n\nSandy Karp, a Waymo spokesperson, took Business Insider through a walkthrough of the new robotaxis during the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.\n\nThe Ojai, pictured on the left, is an EV made by Chinese Tesla rival Zeekr.\n\nKarp told Business Insider that Waymo aims to launch Ojai for public riders by 2026. The company has been testing the vehicle in several cities, including San Francisco.\n\nWaymo will also be adding the Hyundai IONIQ 5 SUV to its vehicle lineup.\n\nThe robotaxi company announced a \"multi-year, strategic partnership\" with the South Korean automaker in late 2024.\n\nA launch date for the IONIQ 5 Waymo has not been announced.\n\nWaymo took a deliberate step in removing any Zeekr branding on the Ojai, going as far as adding a Waymo-branded center cap on the wheels.\n\n\"We want people to see and recognize the same trust that they built in Waymo when they look at these vehicles,\" Karp said. \"What we found is people aren't as familiar with the Zeekr brand. So by naming it the Ojai, we're hoping to bring some of that same brand trust and familiarity to the rider experience.\"\n\nKarp said Waymo chose Ojai as a nod to the company's roots in California and to \"inspire a sense of tranquility.\"\n\nThe Ojai is shaped like a minivan but only seats four riders.\n\nKarp said that the Ojai is \"quite roomy\" and will have \"ample storage in the trunk.\"\n\n\"Once you get in, it is so spacious,\" she said. \"I'm not the tallest person in the room, but when I sit in the Ojai, I can really lean back, relax, stick my feet out. It feels like you're riding in first class.\"\n\nShe added that, as regulations change, there could be an opportunity to remove the steering wheel, allowing for another rider.\n\nWaymo's sixth-generation AI driver will have a reduced sensor suite.\n\nThe fifth-generation Waymo Driver, which drives the existing fleet of Jaguar I-PACE SUVs, has 29 cameras, six radars, and five lidars.\n\n\"Basically, we've taken our learnings from driving over a hundred million fully autonomous miles to inform our next generation sensor suite,\" she said. \"So simplified, cost-effective design that's able to scale to more cities, especially with diverse weather conditions.\"\n\nKarp told Business Insider that advancements in sensor technology allow Waymo to reduce the number of sensors.\n\nThe new lidar, for example, has \"higher density,\" or the ability to see further, the spokesperson said.\n\nThe sensor suite is also considerably less clunky.\n\nThe sensors on the roof of the Jaguars are stacked like a tiered wedding cake. The next-generation sensor suite removes the tier and integrates the 360-degree cameras more seamlessly.\n\nSeveral sensors attached to the sixth-generation Waymo Driver also come with sensor-cleaning mechanisms, including tiny windshield wipers and hidden spray nozzles.\n\nThese additions will help the new Waymo Driver perform in harsher weather conditions.\n\nThe Hyundai IONIQ 5 shares some resemblance to Waymo's retrofitted Jaguar.\n\nBoth cars are white, all-electric SUVs that seat four people. Business Insider took a ride in an IONIQ 5 with Motional, Hyundai's robotaxi venture, and found that the space inside the vehicle is similar to the I-PACE.\n\nThe IONIQ 5 will also share the same sensor suite with the Ojai, but will have a variance as to where the sensors are attached. The Hyundai at CES was a show car rather than the actual car that will be on the roads.\n\nKarp could not speak to the number of IONIQs and Ojais Waymo plans to roll out for the initial launch.\n\nJust like any other car, robotaxis don't last forever.\n\nOver time, Waymo will replace the Jaguars with the Hyundai and Ojai, Karp said, \"because you can only have a car running for so long.\"\n\nKarp said that Jaguar discontinued the I-PACE.\n\n\"We've always worked with several OEMs, so it allows us to scale our fleet,\" she said.",

    "description": "When Dylan Rothenberg moved to China, it felt like the Wild West: \"Everything felt negotiable — anything was possible if you were ambitious enough.\"",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dylan Rothenberg, 32, the founder of Wu Mountain Tea. His words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI realized in high school that my academic strength was learning foreign languages.\n\nMy dad did business in China, and his best friend was Chinese, so I've always had a connection to the country.\n\nWhen I was 15, I went to China to stay with a host family for six months as part of a US government-sponsored full-immersion program. It was in 2009, the golden era of US-China relations.\n\nAt 19, I decided to major in Chinese and economics at the University of Colorado, Boulder.\n\nI spent my junior year abroad in Beijing at Peking University. After six months, I started working as a translator.\n\nI sat in on negotiations with company founders, one of whom ran a tea company. He tasked me with buying tea and shipping it out to Geneva.\n\nI decided to take a temporary leave from school and moved to Guangzhou, home to the world's largest tea market.\n\nChina felt like the Wild West. At the time, nothing was black and white. Everything felt negotiable — anything was possible if you were ambitious enough.\n\nIn the market, I was haggling for goods and negotiating. It was pure adrenaline. I'd see the address of a manufacturer on the back of a packet of tea in the convenience store, then head to that address and start talking to the factory owner.\n\nWhen I was in a factory waiting for tea bags to be produced, a guy invited me to meet his professor, who specialized in tea at the South China Agricultural University. The professor told me to come back to Guangzhou after I graduated, and he'd teach me everything he knew about tea. He told me I'd be his first American tea graduate.\n\nI felt he was offering me a chance to be exceptional at one thing. After talking to my parents, I decided I wanted to focus on tea as a career after completing my bachelor's.\n\nI founded my company, Wu Mountain Tea, in 2015. Two years later, I started my master's degree in tea science and went on to earn a Ph.D. — both completed in China.\n\nHere, I've been able to form deeper personal connections. My best friends are Chinese, and I have close ties with lab colleagues and my gym bros.\n\nOne of my friends grew up in Wushan, the area of Guangzhou where I live, which means \"five mountains.\" I call him my \"sixth mountain.\"\n\nI see my professors two or three times a week. The relationship with teachers here is much closer than in the US. We drink together, have dinner at their homes, and discuss research in real time.\n\nI'll miss China's high-speed rail. It connects cities the size of New York or Chicago with metro-like efficiency. I travel often.\n\nGuangzhou to Shanghai — a distance of 1,500 kilometers, or 930 miles — takes seven hours, and I can arrive 20 minutes before departure and just scan my passport. Then I'm whipping along at 250 kilometers an hour. In the US, traveling equivalent distances is a logistical issue.\n\nThe shrimp dumpling, xiajiao, is my favorite morsel on earth. I can get a serving of roast duck in my campus dining hall for just 6 yuan, around 85 cents, and it's better than any duck dish in New York City's Chinatown.\n\nThe biggest struggle here is that strangers stare at me and point at me. I'm like an alien walking around. Even if they're not saying anything malicious about me, it's upsetting.\n\nIn New York State, where I'm from, you can't really make eye contact like that. It provokes confrontation. And here, I can't just lose my cool when someone is staring or laughing at me. For the last three years, I haven't left the house without a low-brimmed hat.\n\nAt the same time, I know I'm doing something unique. My YouTube channel, dedicated to tea, has more than 50,000 subscribers. If my business continues to grow, I could see myself staying in China — but for now, my plan is to return to the US.\n\nI grew up in Syracuse, the snowiest city in the US. I skied 120 days a year and was an alpine ski racer at a competitive level. I'm more comfortable on skis than on my own two feet.\n\nIn Guangzhou, there's no snow at all. I've been far away from what I love the most for the last 10 years. I plan to move back to Salt Lake City in a couple of years, so I can be closer to the mountains and my family.\n\nDo you have a story about living in Asia that you want to share?

    "fullText": "A former U.S. Navy sailor convicted of selling technical and operating manuals for ships and operating systems to an intelligence officer working for China was sentenced Monday to more than 16 years in prison, prosecutors said.\n\nA federal judge in San Diego sentenced Jinchao Wei, 25, to 200 months. A federal jury convicted Wei in August of six crimes, including espionage. He was paid more than $12,000 for the information he sold, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement.\n\nWei, an engineer for the amphibious assault ship USS Essex, was one of two California-based sailors charged on Aug. 3, 2023, with providing sensitive military information to China. The other, Wenheng Zhao, was sentenced to more than two years in 2024 after he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and one count of receiving a bribe in violation of his official duties.\n\nU.S. officials have for years expressed concern about the espionage threat they say the Chinese government poses, bringing criminal cases in recent years against Beijing intelligence operatives who have stolen sensitive government and commercial information, including through illegal hacking.\n\nWei was recruited via social media in 2022 by an intelligence officer who portrayed himself as a naval enthusiast working for the state-owned China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, prosecutors said.\n\nEvidence presented in court showed Wei told a friend that the person was “extremely suspicious” and that it was “quite obviously” espionage. Wei disregarded the friend's advice to delete the contact and instead moved conversations with the intelligence officer to a different encrypted messaging app Wei believed was more secure, prosecutors said.\n\nOver the course of 18 months, Wei sent the officer photos and videos of the Essex, advised him of the location of various Navy ships and told him about the Essex's defensive weapons, prosecutors said.\n\nWei sold the intelligence officer 60 technical and operating manuals, including those for weapons control, aircraft and deck elevators. The manuals contained export control warnings and detailed the operations of multiple systems aboard the Essex and similar ships.\n\nHe was a petty officer second class, which is a enlisted sailor's rank.\n\nThe Navy's website says the Essex is equipped to transport and support a Marine Corps landing force of over 2,000 troops during an air and amphibious assault.\n\nIn a letter to the judge before sentencing, Wei apologized and said he shouldn’t have shared anything with the person who he had considered a friend. Wei said “introversion and loneliness” clouded his judgment.",

    "description": "An app asking \"Are you dead?\" has gone viral in China, sparking debate about loneliness and the risks of living alone.",
    "fullText": "An app that asks a blunt question — \"Are you dead?\" — has become a hit in China.\n\nThe app, called \"Si Le Me\" (Chinese for \"are you dead\"), requires users to \"check in\" by pressing a button. If they fail to do so for two consecutive days, the app alerts an emergency contact.\n\nDesigned for people living alone, \"Si Le Me\" has surged to become the most popular paid download on China's Apple App Store this week. It costs 8 yuan, or $1.15, to download. The app was launched in mid-2025, but its downloads only surged in early January, according to Chinese media reports.\n\nIts stark, literal name has struck a nerve on Chinese social media, triggering raw discussions about loneliness and the risks of living alone.\n\nSolo living is becoming increasingly common in China, among both young city dwellers and the growing population of old people living independently.\n\nChina could have as many as 200 million one-person households by 2030, with more than 30% of people living alone, according to projections published in 2021 by Beike Research Institute, a real-estate research firm.\n\nA government survey in 2021 found that nearly 60% of Chinese age 60 and above lived alone or only with a spouse, up about 10 percentage points from 2010.\n\nOne of the app's creators told Chinese media the idea grew out of online conversations about safety and isolation among people living alone. The three co-creators were all born in the mid-1990s.\n\nThe app's sudden rise has sparked a wave of discussion on Chinese social media, with users interpreting its popularity as a symptom of deeper loneliness.\n\nA user who goes by Qian Wei said in their post on RedNote on Monday that they \"sense a deep loneliness\" behind the app's success.\n\nFor much of China's history, kinship formed the basic unit of society, but \"this structure has completely collapsed\" in the present day, they wrote.\n\n\"In big cities, everyone is an isolated, atomized individual. People live in soundproof apartments, not knowing the surname of their neighbors,\" they wrote in their post.\n\n\"This creates an extremely intense fear, which is commonly known as 'lonely death,'\" they added.\n\nOther RedNote users echoed the sentiment, describing the app's popularity as a collective \"cry of loneliness.\"\n\nAnother user who goes by Huang Mu Xin Sheng wrote on RedNote on Tuesday that the app made them feel \"extremely uneasy\" because it reduces existence itself to a functional task.\n\nThe app has also stirred debate over its stark name. Some users referred to it as inauspicious, likening it to a curse and urging the creators to rename it. Others said they were willing to pay 8 yuan for peace of mind.\n\nNot all reactions were somber. One RedNote user described the app as a form of \"meme-style stress relief,\" a lighthearted way for young people to cope with mounting pressure.\n\nAnother user framed the app as a source of certainty in an era when life feels increasingly out of control.\n\n\"I check in, therefore I am,\" they wrote.",

    "description": "China has broken a record by installing a massive hypergravity machine that can \"compress\" time and space for the benefit of important experiments.",
    "fullText": "After holding onto the record for possessing the world's most powerful centrifuge (or hypergravity machine) for close to three decades, the U.S. ceded that title to China in 2025. When China's new hypergravity machine — the CHIEF1300 — came online in September 2025, it yanked the title from the centrifuge installed in the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center's (ERDC) Centrifuge Research Complex (CRC) located at Vicksburg, Mississippi. The CHIEF1300's (CHIEF is short for Centrifugal Hypergravity and Interdisciplinary Experiment Facility) reign at the top, however, would only last a few months. In December 2025, China commissioned another even more powerful centrifuge, the CHIEF1900, which is currently the world's most powerful centrifuge.\n\nHypergravity centrifuges are machines designed to produce gravitational forces thousands of times stronger than that of the Earth. They do this by rotating at extremely high speeds and, in the process, creating artificial gravity. These machines have been used by agencies like NASA and ESA for various research purposes, ranging from earthquake simulations, dam failures, and the impact of a high gravity environment on living things. In contrast to hypergravity centrifuges, there are also machines that simulate gravity lower than Earth's.\n\nChina on Monday launched the world's largest centrifuge in terms of capacity, capable of generating 300 times Earth's gravity for a load up to 20 tonnes. The machine, coded CHIEF1300, is one of the core components of the Centrifugal Hypergravity and Interdisciplinary Experiment... pic.twitter.com/3ljFrx334o\n\n— China Science (@ChinaScience) September 29, 2025\n\nAs for the claim that these machines compress space and time, it doesn't actually work the way you may have imagined. One of the purposes of these machines is to test small models of huge structures like dams or foundations. Under high gravity, these tiny models feel the same forces a real-world structure would feel, so a small setup behaves like something much larger. Higher gravity also makes slow processes like soil settling or water flow accelerate, so years of real-world behavior can be observed in days or weeks. This is how hypergravity machines can \"compress\" space and time.\n\nThe capacity of large centrifuges is measured using a unit called g·tonnes (gravity-tonnes). A centrifuge that most people use in their daily lives is a typical washing machine, which, during its fastest spin cycle, generates close to 2 g.tonnes of effective force. The long-time record-holding U.S. centrifuge at Vicksburg was rated at 1,200 g·tonnes — already hundreds of times more powerful than anything encountered in everyday life. China's CHIEF1300 pushed that to 1,300 g.tonnes. The current record holder — the CHIEF1900 — takes it much further, and if not evident already, it is rated to generate up to 1,900 g.tonnes of force.\n\nBoth of China's record-breaking hypergravity centrifuges are located at the CHIEF facility, which is part of the Zhejiang University campus in Hangzhou and has been under construction since 2019. The facility is located 49 feet below ground — a move aimed at minimizing vibrations that could be generated while operating these centrifuges.\n\nWhile the CHIEF1900 has just been installed, its predecessor — the CHIEF1300 — has already been used for several experiments. Notable among these is a study that measured the amount of seismic energy a hydropower-focused dam foundation can withstand. Another group of scientists used it to study the effect of large waves on the seabed. These included looking at the impact of 13-foot high wind-driven waves and a massive 65-foot tsunami on the seabed. The aim of this study was to ascertain if the chosen site is a good candidate to install an offshore wind farm. The CHIEF1300 was also able to reproduce the extreme pressure experienced at depths of around 2000 meters (6500 feet) in the ocean.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "description": "Lower Chinese LNG demand could pressure global markets, especially as new U.S. and Qatari capacity comes online and Russian pipeline and LNG exports to China increase.",
    "fullText": "China is boosting domestic natural gas production, and it is doing it fast. A major LNG consumer—and importer—the country has been key in LNG demand forecasts. Now, these forecasts will need to be revised.\n\nLess than ten years ago, China was struggling to get its domestic gas production off the ground, especially in shale formations. China’s shale geology is different from the U.S. basins, and energy companies were finding it difficult to get commercial production going. Now, China’s state oil and gas majors are pumping more gas than ever and announcing new discoveries in the shale patch.\n\nIn November last year, China produced 22.1 billion cu m, which was a 7.1% increase on the year, Kpler reported this month citing official production data. The increase was driven by “faster-than-expected shale gas ramp-ups in the Sichuan Basin.” Based on that data, the energy analytics firm expects China’s total for 2025 to reach 263 billion cu m, rising to 278.5 billion cu m this year, again thanks to growing shale gas production in the Sichuan and Shanxi basins.\n\nAs with oil, rising domestic production would inevitably affect imports, even as China leans more heavily on natural gas for emission-reduction purposes. Last year, for instance, China booked higher domestic gas production and a rather substantial decline in LNG imports. In fact, imports of liquefied gas last year fell to the lowest in six years after a string of 12 monthly declines in a row. Imports only rebounded at the end of the year but not enough to reverse the decline. Kpler has predicted that Chinese demand for liquefied natural gas is going to decline this year as well, with shale gas production removing some 600,000 tons of LNG demand, reducing the total to 73.9 million tons.\n\nNow, 600,000 tons is not a whole lot in the context of a market where the United States alone exported over 100 million tons last year. But it does serve as yet another evidence of a trend in China to reduce dependence on energy imports, which has implications for global energy commodity markets that have gotten used to relying on China as the ultimate driver of demand.\n\nThe projected decline in China’s demand for gas—and by extension LNG—may interfere with new LNG capacity addition plans and prices, shrinking producers’ profits. It is these plans for a wave of new LNG supply, set to come online by the end of the decade, mostly from the top exporters, the United States and Qatar, that have prompted many analysts to expect an oversupplied LNG market by 2030 that would weigh on prices.",

    "description": "By exceeding a long-standing density barrier, China’s EAST fusion reactor proved that tokamaks can pack way more atoms into its plasma.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nThe plasma density barrier is a mathematical limit to the density of plasma that can exist in a tokamak before destabilizing.\n\nA new study led by a team of scientists in China shows that this limit can be surpassed by carefully controlling the interaction between the reactor wall and the plasma from start-up.\n\nThis could help improve conditions to create nuclear ignition within the plasma, providing energy based on the fiery science at the heart of our Sun.\n\nIn the race for clean energy, no technology is quite as promising as nuclear fusion, but the road toward energy freedom is filled with barriers that scientists must find ways to circumvent or otherwise innovate their way through.\n\nOne of those limitations is what’s known as the plasma density barrier, or the Greenwald limit (named after American physicist Martin Greenwald who discovered the limit in 1988). Put simply, this limit mathematically describes the upper limit of the number of atoms that can be in a plasma before destabilization due to atoms from the tokamak’s metal wall interacting with the plasma itself. However, the big piece of good news with the Greenwald limit is that this isn’t a physical law, but rather a mathematical description of a well-documented phenomenon, meaning there’s possibly a way to engineer our way around this density barrier.\n\nScientists at Chinese Academy of Sciences, operating the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) reactor, in Hefei, China, may have just charted that path. In a new study published in the journal Science Advances, the authors detail the achievement of a “density-free regime” by carefully balancing the interaction of the plasma and the reactor’s walls via plasma-wall self organization (PWSO).\n\nTypically, the soup of atoms known as plasma eventually grows to such a point that atoms with the reactor’s wall interact with it, supercharging the cooling process and eventually leading to destabilization. But in this study, scientists controlled that interaction from start-up by controlling the initial fuel gas pressure and applying an electron cyclotron resonance heating for each discharge. Because plasma-wall interactions were organized from the beginning, the tokamak successfully achieved plasma densities 65 percent beyond the Greenwald limit.\n\n“The findings suggest a practical and scalable pathway for extending density limits in tokamaks and next-generation burning plasma fusion devices,\" Huazhong University of Science and Technology Ping Zhu, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement.\n\nWhile the fusion world eagerly awaits the construction of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in southern France, the EAST reactor in China is one of the leading tokamak reactors in the world. Last year, the reactor successfully contained high-confinement plasma for nearly 17 minutes, smashing their previous record of 403 seconds. The goal now, according to Zhu, is to all achieve this density-free regime under high-performance plasma conditions.\n\nOf course, reliably surpassing the Greenwald limit won’t magically open the doors to a world powered by fusion. Many hurdles remain, particularly developing exotic materials capable of handling the hellish conditions of nuclear fusion for (ideally) many years. Luckily, China is a major partner in the ITER program, so any lessons learned at EAST will be applied to humanity’s greatest attempt at bottling the Sun.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "Vietnam's Communist Party chief To Lam is seeking to combine his party role with the state presidency, officials said, in a move that would align",
    "fullText": "HANOI, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Vietnam's Communist Party chief To Lam is seeking to combine his party role with the state presidency, officials said, in a move that would align Vietnam's political structure more closely to China's ​where President Xi Jinping heads the party and state.\n\nNext week some 1,600 delegates will gather in Hanoi to kick off ‌a week-long Communist Party congress, held every five years to select new leaders and set policy goals for the single-party state.\n\nLam, 68, bid for both top positions ‌at a party meeting in December, seeking initial party approval ahead of the congress, three people briefed by the delegates and another three officials familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nWhile the sources said the party meeting backed Lam to remain party chief, the three people briefed by delegates gave differing accounts on the question of the presidency, a largely ceremonial role but one currently held by the military.\n\nTwo said Lam won support ⁠for his bid, while the third said the ‌conclusion was unclear. In any case, the final decision rests with delegates who will be elected at the congress.\n\nThe party's secretariat did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe combination of the two top ‍jobs for the next five years would mark a significant departure from Vietnam's traditional power-sharing model. Only in exceptional periods after the death of incumbents have the positions been merged, including in 2024 when Lam held both positions for about three months.\n\nShould Lam succeed, the military, a powerful faction ​within the party, would give up the presidency in exchange for maintaining a broad autonomy over the promotion of its senior officers, ‌two sources said.\n\nOne official said military leaders are negotiating \"safeguards\" to limit Lam's authority. The defence ministry was not immediately available for comment.\n\nIn possible signs of early concessions, some controversial economic policies pursued under Lam's first term were revised or faced unexpected hurdles ahead of the congress, including on credit growth and a high-speed railway.\n\nSupporters of combining the two roles argue all other communist countries - China, North Korea, Cuba and Laos - vest both positions in a single leader, and note the move would bolster Lam's economic reform agenda and strengthen his standing ⁠in meetings with foreign leaders.\n\nSceptics see the change as emboldening a leader seen ​as a risk-taker who has already vastly expanded the powers of the security apparatus.\n\nThe ​merger would be \"the natural outcome of streamlining Vietnam's political structure,\" said Carl Thayer, a senior expert on Vietnam at the Australian Defence Force Academy, noting Lam has already effectively taken over some of the president's powers with ‍frequent overseas trips last year.\n\nStarting January ⁠19, the week-long congress will elect 200 members of the new central committee, with a large number of newcomers expected to join, raising questions about whether they will confirm decisions made by the roughly 140 delegates who voted in December.\n\nThe central ⁠committee will elect the party chief and the politburo. Lam in July said the new politburo will have 17-19 members, but the size will depend on delegates' ‌votes on a pre-arranged shortlist.\n\nThe politburo will then nominate the president, prime minister and speaker of the parliament, whose ‌appointments lawmakers must confirm.",

    "fullText": "SHIZUOKA, Japan, Jan 12 (Reuters) - A Japanese mining ship departed on Monday for a remote coral atoll to probe mud rich in rare earths, part of Tokyo's drive to curb its reliance on China for critical minerals as Beijing tightens supply.\n\nThe month-long mission of the test vessel Chikyu near Minamitori ​Island some 1,900 km (1,200 miles) southeast of Tokyo, will mark the world's first attempt to continuously lift rare-earth seabed sludge from 6 km (4 miles) deep onto a ‌ship.\n\nJapan, like its Western allies, has been reducing its dependence on China for the minerals vital to the production of cars, smartphones and military equipment, an effort that has taken on urgency amid a major diplomatic dispute with ‌Beijing.\n\n\"One of our missions is to build a supply chain for domestically produced rare earths to ensure a stable supply of minerals essential to industry,\" Shoichi Ishii, the head of the government-backed project told reporters last month, ahead of the vessel's departure from the port city of Shizuoka on a bright sunny day, with a snow-capped Mount Fuji in the background.\n\nREDUCING RELIANCE ON CHINA WON'T BE EASY\n\nChina last week banned exports of items destined for Japan's military that have civilian and military uses, including some critical minerals. The Wall Street Journal reported Beijing has also begun restricting rare-earth exports ⁠to Japan more broadly.\n\nJapan has condemned China's dual-use ban but declined ‌to comment on the report of a broader ban, which China has not confirmed or denied. Chinese state media, though, have said Beijing was weighing the measure.\n\nFinance ministers from the Group of Seven industrial powers will discuss rare-earth supplies at a meeting in Washington on Monday, sources familiar ‍with the matter told Reuters.\n\nJapan is no stranger to facing China's wrath over rare earths. In 2010, China held back exports following an incident near disputed islands in the East China Sea.\n\nSince then, Japan has reduced its reliance on China to 60% from 90% by investing in overseas projects like trading house Sojitz's tie-up with Australia's Lynas Rare Earths, and promoting rare-earths recycling and manufacturing processes that rely less on ​the minerals.\n\nThe Minamitori Island project, however, is the first to attempt to source rare earths domestically.\n\n\"The fundamental solution is to be able to produce rare earths inside Japan,\" said ‌Takahide Kiuchi, executive economist at Nomura Research Institute.\n\n\"If this new round of export controls ends up covering a lot of rare earths, Japanese companies will again make efforts to move away from China, but I don’t think it will be easy,\" he said.",
