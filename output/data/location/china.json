    "fullText": "LONDON/WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. control of Venezuela's oil exports has ensnared barrels that had been servicing debt to China, lining up another potential showdown between the two superpowers that could further complicate the South American country's path out of default.\n\nAround a tenth of Venezuela's $150 billion foreign debt pile is estimated to be loans from China that ​the OPEC member was paying in oil cargoes - until the U.S. seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro earlier this month.\n\nDebt experts said the ramifications of China's claim on the cargoes and any clash with ‌the United States could make it tougher for Venezuela to restructure its debt after a 2017 default and put at risk Beijing's cooperation in restructuring deals for other developing nations.\n\n\"Even under the best circumstances, this was going to be very messy - trying to disentangle where all ‌these creditors stand in the credit hierarchy,\" said Christopher Hodge, chief economist with Natixis and a former U.S. Treasury official.\n\n\"The fact that now America is controlling all the finances into and out of the country...this seems to be unprecedented to me, that we're going to have such entanglements, such opacity about the finances of a government,\" Hodge said.\n\nWhile Washington currently controls only oil sale proceeds, Hodge noted that these are Venezuela's main source of revenue.\n\nDocuments and sources from state-run oil firm PDVSA show three supertankers have been shuttling between Venezuela and China over the last five years carrying oil for interest payments under the terms of a temporary deal struck in 2019. But these shipments are only ⁠a fraction of Venezuela's total crude exports to China.\n\nAidData, a research lab at ‌the U.S. university William & Mary that tracks lending, said some cash proceeds from oil sent to China went into an account controlled by Beijing and on to service the debt - even as sanctions and default blocked payments to many of Venezuela's other creditors.\n\nThe Trump administration has now said that proceeds from the sale of Venezuela's oil will go into ‍a Qatar-based account controlled by Washington, potentially giving the U.S. President himself substantial leverage over which creditors get paid, and when.\n\nIn response to a request for comment on the cargoes and debt payments, China's foreign ministry said Beijing \"has repeatedly stated its position\".\n\nBeijing condemned the redirection of Venezuelan oil exports during a January 7 news conference, adding \"legitimate rights and interests of China and other countries in Venezuela must be protected\".\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Reuters that Trump had brokered an oil deal with Venezuela ​that \"will benefit the American and Venezuelan people\".\n\nThe Trump administration is allowing China to purchase Venezuelan oil but not at the \"unfair, undercut\" prices at which Caracas sold the crude previously, a U.S. official said on Thursday.\n\nTraders managing Venezuelan oil ‌sales have offered some to Chinese refiners, but these are private market transactions, not intended as debt payments.\n\n\"The people of Venezuela will collect a fair price for their oil from China and other nations,\" the U.S. official said.\n\nThe Venezuelan communications ministry, which handles all press inquiries for the government, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nTrump could yet make a deal with China. However, the planned U.S. takeover of Venezuela's oil sector and control of its revenue could upend the hierarchy of creditors, restructuring advisors warn.\n\n\"All of these things will have the practical effect of subordinating the claims of legacy debtholders,\" said global sovereign debt expert Lee Buchheit, adding it was unclear if Trump had the legal right to determine who gets paid first.\n\nSome $60 billion of Venezuela's bonds tipped into default in 2017, and a restructuring agreement is essential to enable it to borrow again and attract new ⁠investment.\n\nIn a typical restructuring, bilateral lenders come together and agree what losses they will accept, usually via the Paris Club of ​creditor nations. This sets the bar for the \"comparable\" losses private lenders - bond investors, banks and others - must take.\n\n\"Comparability of treatment will be ​a real challenge, particularly if the U.S. controls the use of oil revenues,\" said Mark Walker, a longtime sovereign debt advisor who previously worked on potential Venezuelan restructurings.\n\nIf the U.S. pushes China to swallow significant writedowns on its debt - and China digs its heels in - it could slow a restructuring and hinder Venezuela's economic recovery in the process.\n\nThat could ‍keep Venezuela \"in very dire straits during the foreseeable future\", said ⁠Jean-Charles Sambor, head of emerging market debt with TT International, which holds Venezuelan bonds. In turn, this would limit how much the country can afford to repay to bondholders and other creditors.\n\nChina has little immediate leverage. Countries typically do not take other nations to court or arbitration over lending claims, Walker said, and would need to settle the situation \"on a government-to-government basis\".\n\nBut ramifications are possible: China is the ⁠largest bilateral lender to the developing world and its cooperation with the Paris Club has been crucial over the past decade. Beijing agreed restructuring terms via a platform called the Common Framework during Ghana, Zambia and Ethiopia's debt restructuring talks.\n\n\"China's obvious leverage is to refuse ‌to cooperate in future Common Framework sovereign debt workouts until it feels that it has been treated fairly in Venezuela,\" Buchheit said. \"And that threat would have some force.\"",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to impose 100% tariffs on all Canadian goods and products exported to the US should Ottawa make a trade deal with China.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump warned Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, whom he called \"Governor Carney,\" against making a \"drop off\" deal with Beijing or face the levies.\n\n\"If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life,\" he added.\n\nCarney made an official visit to China last week — the first by a Canadian leader since 2017 — meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to discuss economic and trade opportunities between the two countries.\n\nIn a joint statement following the meeting, Ottawa and Beijing said they had committed to expanding bilateral trade and investment, as well as building cooperation in areas such as energy and agriculture.\n\nCarney also announced that Canada would now allow up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the Canadian market on the \"most-favoured-nation tariff rate of 6.1%.\" In return, he said Canada expected China to lower tariffs on Canadian canola seed to around 15% by March 1.\n\nTrump had initially said that the deal was what Carney \"should be doing\" and that it was \"a good thing for him to sign a trade deal.\"\n\nTrump's changing tone comes days after Carney delivered an impassioned speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he opined on the changing face of global politics since Trump's election.\n\n\"We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition,\" Carney, who did not explicitly name Trump, said, adding that \"middle powers must act together because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu.\"\n\nTrump did not miss the opportunity to snap back at Carney during his own speech at Davos, saying the prime minister \"wasn't so grateful.\"\n\n\"Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "Two malicious extensions in Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code (VSCode) Marketplace that were collectively installed 1.5 million times exfiltrate developer data to China-based servers.\n\nBoth extensions are advertised as AI-based coding assistants that provide the promised functionality. However, they do not disclose the upload activity or ask users for consent to deliver data to a remote server.\n\nThe VS Code Marketplace is the official store for add-ons for Microsoft’s popular code editor. VS Code extensions are installable plugins from the marketplace that add features or integrate tools into the editor. One of the most popular add-on categories right now is AI-powered coding assistants.\n\nResearchers at endpoint and supply-chain security company Koi say that the two malicious extensions are part of a campaign they dubbed 'MaliciousCorgi' and share the same code for stealing developer data.\n\nAdditionally, both of them use the same spyware infrastructure and communicate with the same backend servers. At publishing time, both are present on the marketplace:\n\nThe extensions use three distinct data-collection mechanisms. The first involves real-time monitoring of files opened in the VS Code client. When a file is accessed, its entire contents are encoded in Base64 and transmitted to the attackers’ servers.\n\nAny changes to the opened file are also captured and exfiltrated.\n\n\"The moment you open any file – not interact with it, just open it – the extension reads its entire contents, encodes it as Base64, and sends it to a webview containing a hidden tracking iframe. Not 20 lines. The entire file,\"  Koi researchers say.\n\nThe second mechanism involves a server-controlled file-harvesting command that stealthily transmits up to 50 files from the victim’s workspace each time.\n\nThe third mechanism uses a zero-pixel iframe in the extension’s webview to load four commercial analytics SDKs: Zhuge.io, GrowingIO, TalkingData, and Baidu Analytics.\n\nThese SDKs are used to track user behavior, build identity profiles, fingerprint devices, and monitor activity inside the editor. So, while the first two collect developer work files, the third focuses on user profiling.\n\nKoi Security highlights the risks posed by undocumented functionality in these extensions, including the exposure of private source code, configuration files, cloud service credentials, and .env files containing API keys and credentials.\n\nBleepingComputer has contacted Microsoft about the presence of the two extensions on the VSCode market, but we are still waiting for a reply. We were unable to establish a communication channel with the publisher of the extensions.\n\nWhether you're cleaning up old keys or setting guardrails for AI-generated code, this guide helps your team build securely from the start.\n\nGet the cheat sheet and take the guesswork out of secrets management.",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW, Jan 23 (Reuters) - China is set to ramp up imports of Russian oil in January, absorbing barrels that would have previously gone to India ​and Turkey, as tougher Western sanctions force Moscow to redirect flows, LSEG data ‌and traders said.\n\nThe United States and the European Union imposed sweeping sanctions in late 2025 targeting Russian oil ‌sellers and shippers, including energy giants Rosneft and Lukoil, complicating purchases for global buyers and tightening scrutiny on Russian crude exports.\n\nChina is poised to receive nearly 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of Russian oil by sea this month, compared with 1.1 million bpd in December, according to ⁠preliminary LSEG data. Beijing, already ‌a key consumer of Russian Far East ESPO Blend, also boosted imports of Russian Urals oil to a record high of 405,000 bpd ‍in January, the highest since mid-2023, data provided by energy consultancy Kpler showed.\n\nIndia, previously the largest buyer of Russian Urals by sea since the EU embargo on Moscow's oil in 2022, slashed purchases ​to below 1 million bpd in December, down from an average of 1.3 million ‌bpd last year, LSEG data showed. Indian refiners are expected to keep Russian oil imports near 1 million bpd in January as they diversify supply sources.\n\nTurkey, also a major Russian oil buyer, reduced Urals imports in January to about 250,000 bpd, compared to an average of 275,000 bpd in 2025 and well below the record 400,000 bpd reached in June ⁠last year.\n\n\"As Indian and Turkish buyers cut purchases ​recently, some Russian Urals cargoes headed for China,\" said ​a trader involved in Russian oil sales. He added that the surplus of Urals barrels weighed on prices.\n\nDiscounts for Urals crude delivered to China ‍in late 2025 widened ⁠to as much as $12 per barrel below ICE Brent for some cargoes, while current Urals differentials hover near minus $10 to the benchmark, according to two traders active ⁠in the Asian market.\n\nDemand for Urals in India and Turkey, both major exporters of diesel to Europe, slumped ‌due to the EU ban on fuels produced from Russian-origin crude, the ‌traders added.",

    "description": "“The limiting factor for AI deployment is fundamentally electrical power,” Musk said at the World Economic Forum on Thursday.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk warned the biggest issue hampering AI advancement in the United States is a problem Chinese competitors don’t have.\n\nIn a conversation in Davos, Switzerland, with BlackRock CEO and World Economic Forum interim chair Larry Fink, Musk said AI chip production is increasing exponentially, but electrical power is insufficient, hampering the efficiency of AI data centers in training and deploying AI models.\n\n“I think the limiting factor for AI deployment is fundamentally electrical power,” Musk said. “It’s clear that we’re very soon—maybe even later this year—we’ll be producing more chips than we can turn on.”\n\nThe U.S. has been grappling with an outdated grid system, the result of decades of underinvestment and an aging infrastructure. As tech companies increasingly rely on grid operators for electrical power, reliability issues and production limitations have threatened the speed of AI implementation, raising investor concerns of an AI bubble and fueling the belief that the U.S. has already lost the battle with Chinese tech.\n\nTwo massive data centers in Nvidia’s Santa Clara, Calif., hometown may sit empty for years waiting for electricity to power them, according to energy experts. Meanwhile, the massive increase in demand, combined with the need for updated infrastructure, have driven up electricity bills for the average American.\n\nEarlier this month, the Trump administration and 13 bipartisan governors mounted pressure on operators of the country’s largest grid, PJM Interconnection, to boost power supply, as well as hold an auction for tech firms to make offers on 15-year contracts to build power plants, which would transfer the cost of electricity away from consumers and to data center operators.\n\n“We know that with the demands of AI and the power and the productivity that comes with that, it’s going to transform every job and every company and every industry,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum told reporters last week. “But we need to be able to power that in the race that we are in against China.”\n\nDuring his remarks at the gathering in Davos on Wednesday, President Donald Trump encouraged tech companies to build their own nuclear plants amid the AI push, which he claimed the administration would approve in just three weeks—although these historically take years to approve.\n\nJust as many AI investors fear, China is already well ahead of the U.S. when it comes to production capacity, and the country isn’t saddled with the same limitations as the U.S., Musk said at Davos. China is primarily reliant on solar power, seen as a less expensive alternative to nuclear power, with quicker deployment and fewer safety risks.",

    "description": "Military competition between the US and rivals Russia and China in the Arctic is exposing weaknesses in the US arsenal.",
    "fullText": "For war across the freezing Arctic battlefields, the US faces a problem: it doesn't have the right weapons or tools to reliably detect threats in the region and respond to them quickly.\n\nThe Arctic is an unforgiving place for a war. It's a location where distances are vast, subzero temperatures can cripple equipment, and forces must operate with limited support infrastructure, but as competition with US rivals and adversaries becomes fiercer, there is a growing realization that a future fight could unfold across an Arctic battlespace. Among experts and officials, there's also increasing concern about US readiness.\n\nIf US forces in the region can't spot threats early, position assets effectively, and sustain troops in harsh conditions, the region could become a corridor for undetected attacks.\n\nGaps in Arctic defenses have been one element of President Donald Trump's erratic rhetoric on US interests in the acquisition of Greenland. He has said it is necessary for the substantial US missile defense project known as Golden Dome.\n\n\"If there is a war, much of the action will take place on that piece of ice,\" Trump said on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"Think of it: those missiles would be flying right over the center.\"\n\nThe president isn't the first to call attention to the strategic and national security implications surrounding the Arctic. Warnings have come from across administrations.\n\nLeaders in Washington have expressed similar concerns about the importance of the Arctic region for homeland defense in recent years. In its 2024 Arctic strategy doctrine, the US Department of Defense emphasized the need for better, more modernized all-domain awareness, surveillance and sensors, naval capabilities, and missile warning technologies. Existing systems, the department said, weren't sufficient for the growing threats in the region.\n\nSpecifically, the US, along with some of its NATO allies, has underinvested in capabilities needed to detect, track, and respond to activity across vast Arctic distances.\n\nSome necessary capabilities include aerial and underwater surveillance, as well as defense and naval warfare capabilities like anti-submarine frigates, heavy icebreakers, polar-capable multi-mission surface vessels, and dual-use sealift capacity, Liselotte Odgaard, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, wrote in a new report. Infrastructure such as undersea sensor networks, command and control systems, ports, runways, and roads is also lacking.\n\n\"As a result, the US and its allies have insufficient monitoring, response, and sustainment options,\" she explained. \"These shortfalls allow adversaries to transit waters and territories undetected, sustain forces in combat theaters for prolonged periods, and successfully challenge allied forces in combat-like situations.\"\n\nUS presence, whether through domain awareness or more constant exercises in the region, has also been lacking, leaving the Arctic as the \"shortest and least defended threat sector,\" former deputy commander of US Northern Command, Army Gen. Thomas Carden, said in 2024.\n\nWith recognition of the challenges has come new efforts. Recent moves, like the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Coast Guard’s fiscal year 2026 budget, have included millions of dollars for new icebreakers, Coast Guard cutters, and needed Arctic infrastructure upgrades. The Coast Guard’s newly renamed Arctic District has taken on a more prominent monitoring role, and last year, the service received its first polar icebreaker in over 25 years.\n\nAdditionally, the US is working to field new air defense systems and interceptors to replace or supplement the ones in Alaska. And the Space Force's 2026 budget includes billions for Golden Dome, specifically space-based sensors and interceptors, and modernization efforts at Pituffik Space Base in Greenland.\n\nBut key areas remain underdeveloped.\n\nAs Odgaard wrote in her new report, parts of the airspace over eastern Greenland and the North Pole are not consistently surveilled, and the submarine detection and tracking capabilities along Greenland's eastern coast fall short of what is needed.\n\nThose gaps are concerning as Russia focuses on expanding submarine operations in the Arctic.\n\nUncrewed systems, both naval and aerial drones, could, in theory, extend surveillance coverage across vast areas that are expensive and difficult to patrol without increasing the demand on traditional crewed aircraft and assets.\n\nThe harsh Arctic environment could challenge such efforts. With drones, it could stress their batteries, range, connections, and performance. Recent exercises have shown troops that temperatures below freezing, low visibility, snowy or icy conditions, and strong winds can degrade aerial drones and other equipment.\n\nThe US' renewed investments in preparation for Arctic warfare come as Russia and China are deepening cooperation and more actively pursuing interests in the region. Russia has been looking to expand where its submarines can operate as China positions itself strategically as a \"near Arctic\" nation, joining Russia on joint patrols, including ones near Alaska. China is also investing in naval capabilities, ships, and drones for the region.",

    "description": "From China and the US to India and Russia, here are the 25 largest militaries in the world, ranked by the number of active-duty armed forces.",
    "fullText": "While the US military has pursued ambitious technological advances, manpower remains one of its core pillars.\n\nFrom high-ranking generals to soldiers on the field, human troops remain a key way to assess the reach and power of the world's militaries.\n\nUsing data from the International Institute for Strategic Studies' 2025 Military Balance report, Business Insider ranked countries by the size of their active armed forces and listed their defense budgets, based on 2024 figures.\n\nActive-duty force size is a tally of a country's uniformed troops: airmen, soldiers, sailors, special operators, and Marines. Armies, in particular, depend on size to gain and occupy ground. Militaries can also be a tool of domestic repression, a focus that undercuts its capabilities against an external foe. North Korea, for example, is one of the world's most repressive states, led by a dictator who has repeatedly threatened neighboring South Korea.\n\nThe number of active-duty military personnel is far from the only factor that matters when comparing military power between countries, but it shows latent power that could be augmented via conscription and calling up reservists.\n\n\"Numbers have value, but there's a lot more to military capability,\" said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, DC-based foreign policy and national security think tank.\n\nIISS, a London-headquartered think tank, counts active armed forces, reservists, and paramilitaries as separate categories in its analysis, showing a fuller picture of each nation's manpower.\n\nSome countries have significantly higher numbers of reservists than others — Vietnam has the largest number in the world, estimated at 5 million.\n\nBut while reservists can aid militaries when needed, the quality and longevity of their expertise can vary between conscription- and volunteer-based systems, Cancian told Business Insider.\n\n\"When you look at some countries' reserve numbers, you're often looking at people who haven't trained in 10 or 20 years,\" he said. \"It gives you a big number, but their military value is questionable.\"\n\nAnd while paramilitaries can be effective at enforcing internal security and party strength, Cancian says that \"as a military force, they have essentially zero value.\"\n\nEven when accounting for all of a military's manpower, personnel is only one of the various factors that can qualify a nation's military strength, which also include equipment and readiness.\n\nThere's also the role of technologies in global warfare, the size and sophistication of air forces and naval fleets, amphibious capabilities to land assault forces, command and control systems, or nuclear forces, which all shape military power. Larger and more advanced forces require higher state expenditures.\n\nStill, comparing global manpower offers insight into how countries prioritize military power.\n\nSee how the world's largest militaries stack up.",

    "description": "Hisham Alrayes, CEO of GFH Financial Group, said China is prioritizing open models to spread AI's gains across its economy.",
    "fullText": "Open source — that might be the clearest signal of how China wants artificial intelligence to reshape its economy.\n\nHisham Alrayes, the group CEO of Bahrain-based GFH Financial Group, said China is prioritizing open models and broad deployment to spread AI's gains across the economy, instead of funneling them to a few tech giants.\n\nSpeaking at a Davos panel on China's \"AI+ Economy\" strategy on Wednesday, Alrayes said the country's approach reflects a fundamentally different economic philosophy.\n\n\"You look at the open structure of the China AI philosophy — then you have the non-open structure,\" Alrayes said. \"That signals that the benefit they want to see is to trickle down into the economy, into the companies.\"\n\nChina's most prominent AI breakout, DeepSeek, reflects that philosophy.\n\nIt mostly uses open-source models that have drawn global attention, in contrast to many large US language models that remain closed and proprietary, reaping the benefits of tightly controlled commercial ecosystems.\n\nMeta's former chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, has said that a key reason behind DeepSeek's success is its open-source model, which, he said, can outperform proprietary models in terms of efficiency and innovation by building on shared research.\n\nMeanwhile, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has said that China's open-source AI models could gain an edge globally because they're free, making them more attractive than costly proprietary US systems for governments and countries that can't afford closed models.\n\nSimilarly, Alrayes said, China — in pursuing the open model — is aiming for affordability and scale.\n\n\"It's not the benefit of that company, of that product, the return of that individual. It's not an individual — it's an economy,\" Alrayes said.\n\nThat philosophy is reflected in China's national \"AI Plus\" action plan, which prioritizes diffusion, said fellow panelist Gong Ke, executive director of the Chinese Institute for New Generation AI Development Strategies at Nankai University.\n\nThe policy, he said, focuses on embedding AI across manufacturing, healthcare, finance, education, and other sectors, rather than on breakthroughs such as artificial general intelligence.\n\nHe added that the plan sets explicit adoption targets, with AI agents and intelligent terminals expected to reach 70% penetration by 2027 and 90% by 2030.\n\nAlrayes said China's open-source tilt ultimately reflects a broader goal: making AI an economic utility rather than a profit center for a small group of companies.\n\n\"China is looking to create value throughout the economy, very clear, with very specific objectives across the economy,\" he said. \"Not just as a benefit to those companies. This is the difference in the philosophy.\"",

    "fullText": "In cities across Australia, fleets of nice-looking electric buses quietly ferry thousands of commuters each day. But new warnings from cybersecurity experts have transformed what once looked like a clean energy success story into a geopolitical flashpoint.\n\nOfficials in Australia and the United Kingdom now say some Chinese-made buses may contain code that theoretically lets the buses’ manufacturer shut them down remotely via a so-called “kill switch.”\n\nThe revelation has renewed global fears about foreign-controlled technology embedded in critical infrastructure.\n\nThe spotlight is on the Yutong-made battery-electric buses. It’s a major Chinese manufacturer whose vehicles have been widely purchased in Australia’s capital, Canberra, and other jurisdictions.\n\nBritish reports, citing tests by the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre and Transport for the UK government, found that similar models in Europe could be accessed remotely by the manufacturer’s systems, including diagnostics and software updates, and that, theoretically, such access could be used to stop a bus’s drive system.\n\nThis marks a dramatic escalation in cyber-risk warnings tied that aren’t about phone networks or internet routers but about public transit vehicles. Transport Canberra reportedly responded by launching a fresh investigation into cybersecurity risks linked to the buses, following the British analysis and earlier flags from Norwegian transit authorities who found what they termed a functional remote shutdown capability during tests.\n\nTo cyber researchers, the worry is not that a Chinese government operator is now flipping switches in real time, since there aren’t any confirmed cases of foreign actors actively disabling buses. The concern is that the vulnerability exists at all in imported vehicles that operate on public streets and, in some cases, carry government employees and personnel.\n\n“This isn’t just about buses,” Australian cybersecurity expert Alastair MacGibbon told local media. “It goes to how much control is embedded in the technology we import, and whether those controls could be abused.”\n\nThis episode in neighboring Australia (ally, we mean) reads like vindication for policymakers in the US who have long sounded the alarm over dependencies on Chinese technology.\n\nTransport Secretary Sean Duffy and other hardliners have repeatedly asserted that Chinese-linked vehicles and connected technologies pose unacceptable security risks — even going so far as to say China should never sell cars (or similarly connected vehicles) on American roads “as long as I have breath in my body.”\n\nWhile those comments were dismissed as bluster by critics, the Australian “kill-switch” story has suddenly given them a concrete, globally reported incident to point to.\n\nIn Washington, the Biden administration tightened restrictions on connected vehicles containing Chinese software or hardware, with new rules designed to ban such imports by model year 2027 — a response to precisely the kinds of national security vulnerabilities highlighted by the Australian case.\n\nOpponents of these policies argue that connectivity features, including remote diagnostics and over-the-air updates, are standard across the global auto and transit industries, not unique to Chinese manufacturers.\n\nIndeed, any modern vehicle with internet connectivity might in theory be accessed remotely, whether made in Beijing, Detroit, or Tokyo. Critics in China have taken to global media to warn that U.S. bans could backfire by raising costs and supply chain challenges for American automakers dependent on global components.\n\nBut for many U.S. national security experts, the defining issue isn’t simply connectivity but control. If a foreign company can access the mission-critical systems of vehicles running on public streets — or the energy grids, solar inverters, or AI systems that undergird modern life — then that access becomes a lever that adversaries could exploit during crises.\n\nThe Australian episode has already spurred official reviews of every Yutong model in service. Transport Canberra officials insist there is no immediate operational concern based on current investigations, and that local buses are updated via physical service centers rather than remote connectivity.\n\nBut the warning’s broader resonance has rippled through capitals from London to Canberra, Oslo to Washington: as nations electrify their transit fleets and embrace connected vehicles, they must also reckon with who controls that connectedness.\n\nAnd for American lawmakers who warned loudly (and, in the eyes of some, prematurely) that Chinese technology on wheels isn’t just another import, this moment may well feel like a long-anticipated reckoning.",

In a note to clients, the firm said its annual list of potential black swans was slightly different this year and addressed only \"the most important\" risks, given that there are several black swan threats investors are discussing \"ad nauseam.\"\n\n\"It is a sign of the times that white swans are now in the minority,\" a team led by Matt Gertken, the chief geopolitical and US political strategist at the firm, wrote.\n\nHere's what the firm thinks are the five biggest outlier threats facing markets this year:\n\nOil prices could spiral if the Iranian government collapses. It is a possible event that would jeopardize a significant portion of the world's oil supply, and the inflationary impact of that shock could send the world economy into a recession, the firm speculated.\n\nBCA pointed to recent geopolitical tensions surrounding Iran and estimated there is a roughly 38% chance of a \"massive\" oil supply shock stemming from upheavals in the country. The estimated probability of a \"minor\" oil supply shock is 40%.\n\nA geopolitical shock in the Middle East usually causes crude prices to rise 3% over a month and 10% over three months, according to a historical analysis from BCA.\n\n\"But a real Iran shock would be much bigger than average,\" the firm wrote.\n\nThe strategists acknowledged that President Donald Trump is seeking to avoid an oil supply shock amid pressure from the coming midterm elections. Iran is also incentivized to \"leave oil alone\" in order to avoid attacks from other nations, which should prevent a shock, they said.\n\nThe world's inventory of oil also remains \"substantial\" at around 8 billion barrels, according to estimates from BCA's commodities and energy team.\n\nThe stock market could be in for another bout of turmoil similar to last year's stunning reveal of China's lower-cost AI model if the country pulls ahead of the US in the tech arms race.\n\nChina already spends more on research and development compared to the European Union. Patent applications in the nation also outpace applications in the US, Europe, South Korea, and Japan, BCA said, citing data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\nA technological breakthrough in Beijing could hit stock prices elsewhere around the world, BCA said. The firm pointed to the DeepSeek-fueled sell-off that erased $1 trillion $1 trillion from US stocks last year.\n\n\"This episode could happen again,\" BCA wrote.\n\nShould China make more progress on the AI front, OpenAI, ChatGPT's parent, could see its valuation \"evaporate,\" the firm said.\n\nStrategists later added that they saw a 50% chance of the tech bubble bursting this year.\n\nChina could become economically self-sufficient, removing a key constraint that prevents the country from escalating military conflict related to Taiwan, BCA suggested.\n\nThe firm estimated there is a 39% probability that tensions between China and Taiwan would escalate this year. They also saw a 25% probability that tensions could break out in a proxy war, and a 7% probability that tensions could break out into a major war.\n\n\"What if China reaches technological self-sufficiency so that it can pursue a maximalist policy abroad?\" strategists wrote. \"If China falls deeper into demographic decline, debt-deflation, and dictatorship, then its powers have already peaked and its best chance for creating a sphere of influence is now.\"\n\nChina's economic statistics, like its industrial production, suggest that the nation is not preparing for war at the moment, the firm noted.\n\n\"It is not flashing red, at least not yet,\" the firm said of risk factors that could lead to military conflict.\n\nRussia could seize territory from a NATO member, sparking military conflict between Russia and the alliance. In the worst-case scenario, Russia could make nuclear threats against NATO, and the US may need to step in to \"restore the 'balance of terror,'\" strategists speculated.\n\nThe firm estimated there is a 10% probability of a Russia-NATO war.\n\n\"Russia is currently engaged in a campaign to sabotage Europe's critical infrastructure. The US's lack of solidarity with the allies could encourage overreach. Russia could take its provocations too far,\" the BCA wrote.\n\nWhile the firm said it expects Russia to reach a ceasefire with Ukraine this year, it also pointed to the risk that Trump could provide Ukraine with new military support and funding, which could lead Moscow to become more aggressive in its war with Kyiv.\n\n\"Russia, endangered by the new demands of a longer war against a superior opponent, and having missed the chance to negotiate a favorable ceasefire, could become desperate and even more dangerous,\" the firm added.\n\nShould Russia attack another NATO nation and the US doesn't come to their defense, the alliance would become a \"dead letter,\" BCA said.\n\nAlternatively, the US could also invade Greenland and cause the alliance to dissolve, the firm said, though Trump ruled out using military force to acquire the territory.\n\nBCA said it doubted either scenario would occur, but pegged a 30% probability that the US could harm NATO in some way.\n\n\"The president is determined to seize Greenland at any cost, and to insist on the full extent of his constitutional power as executive and commander-in-chief, then obviously he could conquer Greenland, to hell with the consequences,\" strategists wrote.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is allowing China to purchase Venezuelan oil but not at \"unfair, undercut\" prices at which ​Caracas sold the crude before the U.S. removed President Nicolas Maduro, a ‌U.S. official said on Thursday.\n\nWhile the oil will be sold in the global marketplace, the administration has required ‌that the majority be sold to the United States, the administration official said on condition of anonymity. The U.S. says it will control Venezuela's oil sales indefinitely after seizing Maduro on January 3.\n\n\"Thanks to President (Donald) Trump’s decisive and successful law enforcement operation, ⁠the people of Venezuela will ‌collect a fair price for their oil from China and other nations rather than a corrupt, cheap price,\" the official said.\n\nChina ‍has been Venezuela's top oil buyer for years, and the sales helped Caracas repay massive loans to Beijing in debt-for-oil deals.\n\nThe administration is allowing China to buy the oil at \"fair ​market prices - not the unfair, undercut prices\" at which Maduro sold oil to ‌China to pay debts, the official said.\n\nU.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said last week that the U.S. was receiving about $45 per barrel for Venezuelan oil compared with the roughly $31 Venezuela was getting before Maduro's capture.\n\nTrading houses Trafigura and Vitol have sold some 11 million barrels of oil in an initial supply deal between Venezuela and ⁠the U.S. of stranded crude, representing about a ​quarter of the $2 billion agreement.\n\nTrafigura completed its first ​crude sale to a customer in a deal with Spanish company Repsol while Vitol has negotiated cargoes to U.S. refiners including Valero ‍and Phillips 66 and ⁠to its refinery in Italy, sources said.\n\nChina's oil imports from Venezuela are expected to slump starting in February as fewer tankers have managed to leave ⁠after the U.S. claimed control of the OPEC producer's sales, traders and analysts said last week.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Timothy Gardnerin Washington; Additional reporting by Nidhi Verma in New ‌Delhi; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Andrea Ricci )",

    "fullText": "WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Canadian beef will be exported to China following the relaxation of an import ban that had been in ​place since 2021, the agriculture minister said, though analysts cautioned it will likely ‌be in small amounts.\n\nThe reopening of what could be a vital market for Canadian beef follows the visit ‌of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who reached an agreement with China's leadership to lower tariffs and do more business on a number of agricultural commodities, including canola.\n\n\"We know that there's a large company that's shipping its first load of beef to China next week,\" said Canadian ⁠Agriculture Minister Heath MacDonald on ‌Tuesday. Earlier on social media he said \"China has lifted market access for Canadian beef.\"\n\nChina's customs agency did not immediately respond to a request ‍for comment.\n\nThe move is not expected to have an immediate major impact on Canadian beef exports or prices because North America has a shortage of domestic beef and prices are historically high.\n\nSylvain Charlebois, a ​food market expert known as The Food Professor, said: \"China reopening or expanding access for ‌Canadian beef won't move food prices in Canada in any meaningful way.\n\n\"The volumes involved are relatively small, and Canada simply doesn't have the scale to divert large amounts of beef away from the domestic market without disrupting other exports first.\"\n\nHowever, China is an important market for certain cuts of beef, so the reopening is important for Canadian farmers and ⁠beef exporters.\n\nBeef market analyst Jerry Klassen said: \"It's very important ​for Canadian beef farmers to have access to as ​many markets as possible. The Chinese market is very important because it has potential for significant growth.\"\n\nKlassen and the Canadian Cattle Association said the ‍details on the reopening ⁠were not yet available, so the full implications would only be understood once they were. However the association celebrated the resumption of trade.\n\nChina was Canada's fourth largest ⁠beef market in 2021, before being suspended in December of that year.\n\nChina can be a vital export market ‌for Canada when North America has a beef surplus and domestic prices ‌are low.",

    "fullText": "For many decades, the Chinese government attempted to limit population growth through a one-child policy — only to abolish the rule in 2016 as it realized that the number of annual births had started to plummet at alarming levels.\n\nThe aggressive policy — alongside other extreme measures — succeeded far too well, with birth rates dropping a staggering 17 percent between 2024 and 2025 to the lowest level since 1949. The country’s population is now actively shrinking each year, and it’s hard to imagine how the trend could be reversed.\n\nThe situation has gotten so dire that Beijing eliminated tax incentives on condoms, hormonal birth control, and other contraceptives, as Fortune reports. Basically, it’s now desperately trying to reverse itself out of a fertility crisis of its own doing. President Xi Jinping has practically been pleading with the country’s women to bear more children.\n\nYet fewer and fewer women thereare interested in raising a family, sending China well below the “replacement rate” of 2.1 children per woman, meaning the government’s interventions are doing little to address the issue. Many countries around the world, including most of North and South America, and Europe, are already experiencing below-replacement fertility rates. The situation playing out in China is a preview for what’s still to come in many other regions projected to experience a similar decline.\n\n“The empirical evidence from other countries so far is that monetary incentives have almost no effect in raising fertility,” University of California professor of sociology Wang Feng told the New York Times.\n\nDespite its economy growing by five percent last year, over 11 million people died while only 7.92 million babies were born. Meanwhile, a hot new app is trending in China that takes the form of a countdown timer that has to be reset regularly by single people so that their friends and family will know if they die alone.\n\nThe number of working-age people is also dropping as the population continues to age, further taxing healthcare systems and pension funds. The major drop in the fertility rate will continue to have devastating effects, shifting demographics that could result in a worsening economic outlook. The cost of raising a child in China is still extremely high compared to other countries.\n\n“With China’s economic woes, young people may want to wait and see, and that’s not good news for raising fertility,” Wang told the NYT.\n\nIn short, whether taxes on contraceptives and Xi’s calls for a “new type of marriage and childbearing culture” will reverse China’s plummeting birthrate remains unclear at best.\n\nThe country’s population has been shrinking since 2022, and judging by the latest numbers, the trend is bound to continue. And as the population continues to age, hundreds of millions could soon be leaving the workforce — a demographic crisis and ticking time bomb in one.\n\nMore on China’s population: Hot New App Makes Single People Check in Constantly in Case They Die Alone",

    "description": "A new report warns the U.S. could lose the ability to sustain combat within weeks of a China war over Taiwan, as munitions run dry, logistics collapse and global markets face a $10T shock.",
    "fullText": "FIRST ON FOX: The Trump administration asked for redactions to a sweeping new Heritage Foundation report modeling a potential U.S.–China war over Taiwan, even though the analysis relied entirely on publicly available, unclassified data, according to the report’s authors.\n\nThe redacted report, TIDALWAVE, warns that the United States could reach a breaking point within weeks of a high‑intensity conflict with China — conclusions that the authors say prompted senior national security officials to seek redactions over concerns adversaries could exploit the findings or use them to identify U.S. and allied military vulnerabilities.\n\nThose conclusions include warnings that U.S. forces would culminate far sooner than China, suffer catastrophic losses to aircraft and sustainment infrastructure in the Pacific, and still fail to prevent a global economic shock estimated at roughly $10 trillion, nearly a tenth of global GDP.\n\nSKIES AT STAKE: INSIDE THE US-CHINA RACE FOR AIR DOMINANCE\n\nAccording to the report's authors, the AI‑enabled model drew exclusively on open‑source government, academic, industry and commercial information. An unredacted version of the report was provided to authorized U.S. government recipients for internal use.\n\nUnlike traditional tabletop war games, TIDALWAVE employs an AI‑enabled model that runs thousands of iterations, tracking how losses in platforms, munitions, and fuel compound over time and drive cascading operational failure early in the conflict.\n\nAccording to a Heritage spokesperson, the report had been shown to \"high-level national security officials\" who requested some of the specifics be crossed out in black ink before its release to the public. The report still details how quickly U.S. forces could reach a breaking point and why the conflict would carry global consequences.\n\n\"Redactions were made at the request of the U.S. government to prevent disclosure of information that could reasonably enable an adversary to (1) re mediate or ‘close’ critical vulnerabilities that the United States and its allies could otherwise exploit, or (2) identify or exploit U.S. and allied vulnerabilities in ways that could degrade operational endurance, resilience, or deterrence,\" the report said.\n\nA Department of War spokesperson declined to comment on discussions surrounding TIDALWAVE's publication, but added: \"The Department of War does not endorse, validate, or adjudicate third-party analyses, nor do we engage publicly on hypothetical conflict modeling. As a general matter, we take seriously the protection of information that, if aggregated or contextualized, could have implications for operational security.\"\n\nThe White House could not be reached for comment.\n\nAccording to the report’s redacted findings, the U.S. would culminate in less than half the time required for the People's Republic of China in a high-intensity conflict. Culmination is defined as the point at which a force becomes incapable of continuing operations due to the loss of platforms, ammunition and/or fuel.\n\nThe report is explicit that the first 30 days to 60 days of a U.S.-China war determine its long-term shape and outcome, as early losses in aircraft, ships, fuel throughput and munitions rapidly compound and cannot be recovered on operationally relevant timelines.\n\nThe report concludes that the U.S. is not equipped nor arrayed to protect and sustain the Joint Force in a conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific. Rapid platform attrition, brittle logistics, concentrated basing and insufficient industrial surge capacity combine to force an early operational breaking point for American forces.\n\nThe report warns that U.S. reliance on a few large, concentrated forward bases — particularly in Japan and Guam — leaves American airpower dangerously exposed to Chinese missile forces.\n\nIn multiple scenarios, up to 90% of U.S. and allied aircraft positioned at major forward bases are destroyed on the ground during the opening phase of the conflict, as runways, fuel depots, command facilities and parked aircraft are hit simultaneously.\n\nThe report finds that critical U.S. precision‑guided munitions — including long‑range anti‑ship missiles, air‑to‑air interceptors and missile‑defense systems — begin to be unavailable within five to seven days of major combat operations. Across most scenarios, those critical munitions are completely exhausted within 35 days to 40 days, leaving U.S. forces unable to sustain high‑tempo combat.\n\nFuel emerges as the most decisive vulnerability of all. The report makes a critical distinction: the U.S. does not run out of fuel in most scenarios — it loses the ability to move fuel under fire.\n\nCHINA’S MISSILE SURGE PUTS EVERY US BASE IN THE PACIFIC AT RISK — AND THE WINDOW TO RESPOND IS CLOSING\n\nChinese doctrine explicitly prioritizes attacks on logistics vessels, ports, pipelines and replenishment tankers. Even limited tanker losses, port disruptions or pipeline severance are sufficient to drive fuel throughput below survivable levels, forcing commanders to sharply curtail air and naval operations despite fuel remaining in aggregate stockpiles.\n\nChinese ammunition stockpiles of critical munitions begin to be depleted after approximately 20 days to 30 days of major combat operations. However, substitution effects extend China’s ability to sustain combat operations out to months — well beyond the point at which U.S. forces culminate, according to the report.\n\nThe consequences extend far beyond the battlefield.\n\nThe redacted report concludes the U.S. is highly unlikely to prevent massive global economic fallout once a Taiwan conflict begins.\n\nDisruption of shipping lanes, destruction of critical infrastructure and the collapse of Taiwan’s semiconductor production would trigger a global economic shock estimated at roughly $10 trillion, with enduring ripple effects across financial markets, manufacturing and global trade.\n\nThe report comes amid years of concern over U.S. military readiness and industrial capacity, as China rapidly expands its naval forces and shipbuilding base.\n\nThe U.S. Navy operates a smaller fleet than planned, while American shipyards face workforce shortages, aging infrastructure and chronic delays — even as China, the world’s largest shipbuilder, continues to outpace the U.S. in producing new naval hulls.\n\nWar Secretary Pete Hegseth and other military leaders have vowed to put the Pentagon on a wartime footing for industrial capacity.\n\nPerhaps most alarming, TIDALWAVE warns that the scale of losses in the Indo‑Pacific would leave the U.S. unable to deter or respond effectively to a second major conflict elsewhere in the world.\n\nA war over Taiwan could open the door to follow‑on aggression by adversaries such as Russia, Iran or North Korea, fundamentally destabilizing the global security order.\n\nThe report is blunt in its assessment: existing Pentagon programs and congressional funding are too slow, too fragmented and too modest to address the scale of the challenge. In many cases, the timeline required to fix critical vulnerabilities exceeds the likely timeline to conflict.\n\nTo avoid what the authors describe as a strategic defeat, the report urges Congress to immediately expand munitions stockpiles, strengthen fuel reserves and distribution infrastructure, harden and disperse forward bases, and accelerate sustainment and logistics reforms. Without rapid action, the authors warn, the U.S. risks entering a conflict it is structurally unprepared to fight or sustain.\n\nWith intelligence warnings mounting that China could move on Taiwan before the end of the decade, TIDALWAVE cautions that the window to correct these deficiencies may be closing faster than Washington is prepared to act.",

It also introduced a guarantee plan totalling 500 ⁠billion yuan ($71.83 billion) over two years for private ​investment.\n\nZhou Chen, an official at the NDRC, said the ​government would continue to use trade-in subsidies to support consumption of goods like electric vehicles, but its focus was shifting toward services.\n\nOfficials say services, ‍including elderly care, healthcare ⁠and leisure, offer substantial room for growth.\n\n\"The services sector has now become a key focus in efforts to expand domestic demand,\" Zhou said.\n\nIn December, China deployed 62.5 ⁠billion yuan ($8.98 billion) in special treasury bond funds to support its 2026 consumer trade-in scheme for appliances ‌and new-energy vehicles.\n\n($1 = 6.9606 Chinese yuan renminbi)",

    "description": "China's EV boom came from stable policy, while policy changes elsewhere are holding the transition back, a BYD executive says.",
    "fullText": "The global EV transition has a policy problem, says BYD executive vice president Stella Li.\n\nLi said in a panel session on EVs on the second day at Davos that governments keep changing the rules about EVs. The stop-start approach makes it harder for automakers to commit capital, plan product cycles, or build supply chains with confidence, even as competition across the EV markets in China, the US, and Europe heats up.\n\nLi said that when countries go \"back and forth\" on their EV policy, it creates a pattern that \"will confuse manufacturers.\"\n\nIn contrast, when governments give a \"very clear line,\" automakers can focus on execution, Li said.\n\nThat inconsistency has real consequences, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said on the same panel.\n\n\"The back and forth policies at the national level have made it more difficult for industry to throw all in and ramp up the way that some of the Chinese companies have been able to,\" she added.\n\nElaine Buckberg, former chief economist at General Motors, said on the panel that automakers typically plan vehicles five years before launch and expect to sell them for years afterward. Stable, long-term regulations are critical for companies expanding into EVs.\n\n\"Keeping those incentives stable, that's really powerful,\" she said. \"That's a place where the US is really pulling back under the Trump administration.\"\n\nChina has a clear lead over the US in electric vehicles, Li and two of her co-panelists said.\n\nLi said consumer demand, rapidly improving technology, and China's dense charging network are accelerating adoption and making EVs a practical choice for everyday drivers.\n\nIn China, EVs are not only bringing a \"sustainable future,\" but also bringing \"innovation,\" Li said.\n\nIndustry leaders have been vocal about China's dominance in the global EV market.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley said in an episode of The Verge's \"Decoder\" podcast in September that \"the Chinese are the 700-pound gorilla in the EV industry.\"\n\n\"There's no real competition from Tesla, GM, or Ford with what we've seen from China. It is completely dominating the EV landscape globally and more and more outside of China,\" he added.\n\nFarley said that China has \"great innovation at a very low cost,\" and that companies have \"huge subsidies\" and are sponsored by their local governments.\n\nChina's government poured at least $230 billion into supporting domestic EV makers between 2009 and 2023, according to a 2024 report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\"There's no secret magic thing that you're like, 'Oh, aha, they did this.' But rather it's the compounding benefits of a lower cost of capital,\" said Rivian's CEO, RJ Scaringe, in an episode of the \"Everything Electric\" podcast published in September.",

    "fullText": "MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. announced Monday the discovery of a new natural gas deposit near the disputed South China Sea, which could shield his country from a potential power crisis.\n\nThe “significant discovery\" northwest off Palawan province, close to an existing gas field in waters adjacent to the critical waterway, could eventually supply power to more than 5.7 million households or nearly 200,000 schools for a year, Marcos said, adding further tests and another drilling in the area would be done “to pursue more potential gas resources.\"\n\nThe undersea reservoir is estimated to contain about 98 billion cubic feet (2.7 billion cubic meters) of gas. Initial tests showed 60 million cubic feet (1.6 million cubic meters) of gas could be extracted daily from the well, Marcos said, without providing further details, including when commercial production could start.\n\n“This helps Malampaya’s contribution and strengthens our domestic gas supply for many years to come,” Marcos said. “Aside from the natural gas, the discovery also includes condensate, which is a high-value liquid fuel.”\n\nThe new gas deposit, called Malampaya East 1, was discovered by a consortium about 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) east of the main Malampaya gas field, where commercial gas production started more than two decades ago and was projected to considerably decline in a few years.\n\n“We're proud that Filipinos led this drilling and, more importantly, they completed it without any accident or environmental incidents,” Marcos said.\n\nThe Malampaya gas-to-power facility has generated more than 20% of Luzon's electricity, the most populous northern Philippine island region. In 2023, Marcos extended an exploration contract in Malampaya by 15 years.\n\nExperts have predicted Malampaya could run out of gas in a few years, sparking fears of a potential power crisis in Luzon, where the bustling capital and main financial and business district is located.\n\nThe offshore gas field lies within the country’s Exclusive Economic Zone of the Philippines, a 200-nautical-mile (370-kilometer) stretch of water from a country’s coastline where it has exclusive rights to explore and harness resources under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\n\nPhilippine efforts to explore for oil and gas in another offshore region, the Reed Bank, have been stalled for years because of opposition from Beijing, which claims sovereignty over the area along with most of the South China Sea. The Reed Bank also lies in the fringes of the South China Sea west of the Philippine island province of Palawan.\n\nChina has opposed Vietnam’s oil and gas exploration in the disputed region. Beijing claims virtually the entire South China Sea and has reinforced its presence, including coast guard and naval patrols in the disputed waterway in recent years.\n\nMalaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have also been involved in the region's long-simmering territorial standoffs.",

    "description": "China faces a shrinking population and record-low birth rates, challenging economic growth and straining pensions and healthcare.",
    "fullText": "China's population is shrinking — and the decline is accelerating.\n\nThe country's population fell for the fourth year in a row, falling by 3.39 million to 1.405 billion people in 2025, according to new data from China's National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nIts birth rate hit its lowest level on record — 5.63 per 1,000 people — since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, while the death rate climbed to 8.04 per 1,000 people. The number of babies born in the country dropped to 7.92 million, down from 9.54 million in 2024.\n\nThe United Nations predicted in 2024 that China's population could fall as low as 663 million — less than half its current population — by 2100, if birth rates continue to decline and immigration stays low.\n\nIf things don't change, China's shrinking and aging population poses serious long-term risks for the country's economy. It could mean a much smaller workforce, weaker demand for goods and services such as housing, and mounting pressure on pension and healthcare systems. A smaller working-age population in China could also hurt the global economy, which has relied on China's booming productivity and economic growth.\n\nChina reported that its economy grew by 5% last year, meeting its official growth target. The country also logged a record trade surplus in 2025, despite President Donald Trump's tariffs. However, it's struggling with soaring unemployment among young people and an ongoing oversupply of housing, which has tanked property values, hurting consumer spending and slowing investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, and real estate.\n\nThe population of mainland China began shrinking in 2022, when it declined by 850,000 people after years of falling birth rates. That year marked the first time the country's population had declined since a major famine killed an estimated 30 million people during Mao Zedong's failed Great Leap Forward in the early 1960s.\n\nChina's demographic challenges have unfolded faster than the government once anticipated. The government has loosened previous restrictions to counter the effect, dropping the one-child policy a decade ago to allow families to have two children. Five years ago, it began allowing three children.\n\nIn recent years, the government has raced to lift the fertility rate by offering financial incentives to parents, tightening access to abortions, and, more recently, imposing new taxes on contraceptives, including birth control and condoms. There is little evidence these efforts have been successful at lifting birth rates.\n\nThough its situation is serious, China is far from alone in declining fertility. Birth rates are falling in countries around the world, particularly in higher-income nations, including the US. Fertility rates below the \"replacement rate\" of 2.1 births per woman are \"becoming the global norm,\" according to a report by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. This has sparked similar economic concerns about a shrinking workforce and a growing elderly population.\n\nThe US has a slightly rosier population forecast than other major economies, as it's set to grow slightly due to immigration.",

    "fullText": "The next stop on Donald Trump’s world tour—or takeover—may be America’s northern neighbor.\n\nThe president, 79, has turned his attention toward Canada, fixating on what he sees as vulnerabilities along its northern border that could be exploited by U.S. adversaries Russia or China, two U.S. officials, a senior administration official, and three former senior U.S. officials told NBC News.\n\n“They certainly need to up their game when it comes to Arctic capabilities,” one official told the outlet, adding that Canada’s northern border “is not acceptable given today’s threats” and that “the status quo is not enough.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about what he views as Canada’s weak defenses, sparking conversations with Canadian officials about a broader Arctic security strategy, NBC reported. Among the initiatives that have caught Trump’s interest are expanded U.S. maritime patrols and the purchase of additional icebreakers—specialized ships designed to operate in ice-covered waters—operating in or around Canadian territory.\n\n“Trump is really worried about the U.S. continuing to drift in the Western Hemisphere and is focused on this,” one official told NBC.\n\nThey added: “At the end of the day, this is to stop Russia and China from having a further presence in the Arctic.”\n\nWith 3.85 million square miles and 40 million residents, Canada is the largest target on Trump’s growing list of potential land grabs.\n\nThe conversations come as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Friday, signaling an effort to deepen ties between the two countries. Carney became the first Canadian leader to visit China since 2017.\n\nTrump’s fixation on Canada, aides say, is part of a broader effort to “solidify” the Western Hemisphere—and falls in line with his aggressive campaign to acquire Greenland, the semiautonomous Danish territory.\n\n“Canada stands to benefit from the U.S. having Greenland,” one administration official said.\n\nCarney on Friday voiced support for Denmark’s NATO membership and said Greenland—home to roughly 57,000 residents and located northeast of Canada—should determine its own future.\n\nTrump’s increasingly frequent assertions that “We do need Greenland, absolutely,” for defense purposes, have rattled Denmark, whose leaders have repeatedly warned they will not give up the world’s largest island, and that an American takeover would end NATO.\n\nWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller asserted on Saturday that under “the law,” nations were not entitled to their territory if they were unable to defend it. The Trump aide belittled the Danish government, saying its “tiny” military was failing to adequately protect Greenland.\n\n“With respect to Denmark, Denmark is a tiny country with a tiny economy, and a tiny military,” Miller said of Fox’s Hannity.\n\n“They cannot defend Greenland. They cannot control the territory of Greenland. Under every understanding of law that has existed about territorial control for 500 years, to control a territory you have to be able to defend a territory, improve territory, inhabit a territory. Denmark has failed on every single one of these tests.”\n\nMeanwhile, officials told NBC that the White House has voiced similar criticisms of Canada, which has increased its defense spending but continues to fall short of NATO’s goal.\n\n“The world doesn’t see Canada as a major force when it comes to defense,” the official told NBC.\n\nTrump has previously said “it’s highly unlikely” he would use military force against Canada. But after his shock invasion of Venezuela and the abduction of then-President Nicholas Maduro on Jan. 3., the president has not ruled out deploying U.S. military troops to countries including Colombia, U.S. ally Mexico, and Greenland.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House and to Carney’s representatives for comment.",

    "fullText": "Designing a Formula 1 engine has helped Ford gain the edge against Chinese cars, Ford's CEO Jim Farley said.\n\nFord announced in 2023 that it would supply Oracle Red Bull Racing with its engines from 2026. On Friday, Red Bull unveiled its car for the 2026 Formula 1 season, powered by the Red Bull Ford Powertrains engine.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg published on Sunday, Farley was asked how developing the engine has helped him deliver better value for his customers.\n\n\"It's a long list, but I would say the real signature for me is really the software — the control software for the hybrid system, predictive failure components,\" Farley said.\n\nAnd designing better software is a key step to beating Chinese cars, he said.\n\n\"These are the essence of the new software-defined vehicle globally to beat China, and they are really good,\" he added. \"We need these capabilities from Formula 1, and we can put them right in the Transit van.\"\n\nWorking on the F1 engine with Red Bull has helped Ford understand LLMs and predict component failures, which can benefit both Red Bull driver Max Verstappen and Ford's customers.\n\nThis is not Ford's first foray into F1. It supplied engines for the race from 1967 until 2004.\n\nFarley has, on several occasions, gushed about the tech capabilities of China's automobiles. In October 2024, he said he had been driving an EV from the Chinese tech giant Xiaomi for half a year and didn't want to give it up.\n\nAnd in July, speaking at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Farley said, \"They have far superior in-vehicle technology,\" citing Xiaomi's phone-to-car pairing capabilities.\n\nChinese automobile companies, particularly EV makers, have gone all in on smart technology in recent years. An executive of CATL, a Chinese EV battery manufacturer, said during the World Economic Forum last year that China's automakers were retiring the traditional term \"EVs\" in favor of \"EIVs,\" or electric intelligent vehicles.\n\nAnd after the Chinese AI company DeepSeek launched its R1 model last year, major automakers like BYD, Geely, and Great Wall Motor said they would integrate it into their cars.",

    "fullText": "China is now a key market for global carmakers, and, surprisingly, buyers there are shifting back to sedans that offer serious tech. Automakers are pushing boundaries to get noticed, and Nissan is one of them. The brand launched two new electrified sedans and a refreshed Teana late last year – the latter being the more premium take on the Altima sold in the US.\n\nThe new Teana, built by Dongfeng Nissan, puts a big emphasis on tech and interior quality. It looks a class above what you’d expect from an Altima-based sedan. Part of that comes from a glowing AI speaker on the dash, but the real surprise is the material choice. Nissan worked with Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (MCC) to use Durabio, a plant-based plastic that looks and feels closer to crystal than the usual trim.\n\nIn China, buyers care about big screens, lighting, and how upscale a car feels. The Teana’s interior is built to make a strong first impression, and it stands out even more when you see it lit up at night.\n\nDurabio is more than just a marketing fluff. MCC developed it as a bio-based plastic using plant-derived isosorbide. It’s clearer and handles light better than regular polycarbonate, which helps create lighting that looks deep and high-end instead of cheap or artificial.\n\nOn the Teana, Durabio is used for the inverted-pyramid AI speaker that lights up with six pillars glowing in up to 256 colors. The material refracts light cleanly, giving it a crystal-like look without needing a clear coat. That saves manufacturing steps, lowers environmental footprint, and still meets automotive durability standards.\n\nTeana runs a Huawei-based operating system to go with Durabio. The end result is an interior that feels modern and thoughtfully put together (at least visually), not just a quick update.\n\nMeanwhile, the US-market Altima heads into 2026 with almost no changes from last year. It remains affordable and practical, but next to the Teana, it comes across as very restrained. Nissan still sells a lot of sedans in the US, with over 255,000 units last year (out of the brand's over 760,000-unit sales), but the Altima’s own sales dropped to 93,268 in 2025, down 18 percent from the year before.\n\nThat drop probably comes from the Altima’s age. The current model dates back to 2018, with its last big update in 2022. It no longer stands out for design or interior appeal. After seeing what Nissan has done with the Teana, it’s fair to ask (hope, even) if a more upscale, more distinctive Altima could bring buyers back to the midsize sedan segment.\n\nFor now, there’s no clear answer. But with China getting the more ambitious upgrades, it’s easy to see how a bit of that Durabio-inspired thinking could only help the Altima.\n\nView the 9 images of this gallery on the original article",

    "fullText": "At the start of 2025, alarms were blaring about the risk of investing in China.\n\nA new protectionist administration was taking over in the US at the same time China's domestic real estate market was teetering. A possible US ban on TikTok, the popular social media app, imperiled ByteDance, one of the country's biggest tech companies. American companies seemed to have surged ahead of Chinese rivals in artificial intelligence development.\n\nTwelve months later, and many of the biggest fears appear to be overblown. The Chinese government has focused on stimulating the economy, leading public companies to significantly increase their buybacks. ByteDance sold a majority stake in its US TikTok operations and is now more valuable than ever, with HSG, the venture capital firm formerly known as Sequoia China, valuing the company at between $350 billion and $370 billion recently. And China's AI scene, led by startup DeepSeek, is keeping pace with Western peers, and Nvidia will be permitted to sell its powerful H200 chips to Chinese companies, the US government said Tuesday.\n\nHedge funds willing to invest in the country last year were rewarded. Bridgewater, which manages $92 billion across all its strategies, generated a 34.2% return in its China Total Returns fund, a person close to the manager told Business Insider. Tekne Capital, managed by Beeneet Kothari, a onetime lieutenant of billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller, was up more than 50% last year, a person close to the manager said.\n\nKothari's $1.5 billion firm is an investor in Chinese companies such as DiDi Global, recruiting firm Kanzhun, and data-center builder GDS, the person said. Kothari told Business Insider in an interview last year that the headwinds facing the country made strong companies very cheap.\n\nAccording to HSBC's Hedge Weekly report, funds based in China and investing in the country performed well. $3.4 billion Pinpoint's China-focused strategy returned more than 24%, while its multistrategy offering, which invests across Asia, was up 11.6%. George Jiang's long-running Golden China fund made close to 33%, and Epimelis Capital, run by Hutchin Hill and Goldman Sachs veteran Fei Sun, made 35% in its China-centric strategy.\n\nThe average China-focused fund was up close to 18%, according to Hedge Fund Research, outpacing the industry average of 10.7%.\n\nGoing into 2026, investors will be watching how the volatile relationship between the US and China evolves, especially around trade agreements connected to chips, as well as any indication that China might invade Taiwan.\n\nByteDance will also be a focus for funds — Tiger Global and Coatue are both backers — as the social media giant continues to grow.",

    "description": "Nvidia could face the risk of ceding its software edge if it loses the China market.",
    "fullText": "Nvidia's (NVDA) China business continues to face geopolitical hurdles, which could pose longer-term competitive risks for the AI chipmaker.\n\nOngoing US-China tensions have upended Nvidia’s sales in what was one of its largest markets. In the company’s most recent quarter, revenue from China, which includes Hong Kong, dropped 45% from a year ago to about $3 billion, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nAnd while the Trump administration green-lighted the sale of Nvidia’s H200 chip to China this week, albeit with a 25% tax, Reuters reported that China is barring imports of the GPUs except in special cases.\n\nSo far, Nvidia's dominant position in the chip market doesn't appear to have suffered much after the company initially lost access to the Chinese AI market in 2025. It became the first company with a $5 trillion valuation last fall. Despite a decline in China sales, its third quarter revenue overall soared more than 60% during the period to about $57 billion.\n\nBut over the long term, the Chinese commercial sector’s development and use of domestic chips could narrow Nvidia’s lead on the global stage, Wall Street analysts told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThey said Nvidia's dominance in AI software could suffer if Chinese tech developers begin making advances in open source alternatives, which would hurt its leadership in hardware as well.\n\n“That's the real nightmare scenario,” Seaport analyst Jay Goldberg said.\n\nMuch of Nvidia’s competitive edge comes from its software stack. Developers using its AI systems rely on the company’s CUDA platform, which includes a library of proprietary tools that lets them program its GPUs efficiently and reinforces the company’s dominance in the chip market.\n\nAs companies build on CUDA, the cost of switching to a new software platform becomes disadvantageous, and they end up sticking with Nvidia’s offerings, which are only available if developers are programming on Nvidia's GPUs. Hence, the preference for Nvidia's software is key to maintaining its lead in the hardware space.\n\nWhile China’s chip suppliers — from tech giants Huawei and Alibaba (BABA) to newly public players such as Moore Threads and MetaX — lag Nvidia in the performance capabilities of their chips, there’s a risk that the country’s AI developers, forced to use those inferior, domestically-produced chips, will build their own open-source software. Open-source AI software is typically written to run on many different types of chips.",

    "fullText": "As a viral app sparks debate about solo living in China, new Census Bureau data shows that the share of one-person households in the US is reaching record highs.\n\nA new app has risen to the top of China’s iPhone App Store charts — one markedly more macabre than the messaging platforms and AI assistants that typically lead the ranking.\n\nOn Monday, media outlets reported that the viral app Sile Me (which roughly translates from Mandarin as a very literal “Are You Dead?”) had become the country’s most popular paid Apple App Store download.\n\nLaunched in mid-2025 and costing a mere 8 yuan ($1.15) to buy, Sile Me offers just one function: a large button that users can press to confirm that they are, in fact, alive. If they fail to do so for two consecutive days, the app will reach out to an appointed emergency contact.\n\nWhile the app’s simplicity is reminiscent of some earlier patrons of the App Store, its sudden popularity is putting the spotlight on the growing cohort of solo dwellers in the Eastern nation.\n\nResearch suggests that there could be as many as 200 million one-person households in China by 2030 — and while a rapidly aging population explains some of that rise, younger people now also appear to be embracing living alone.\n\nIn America, it’s no different. Data from the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey for 2025 reveals that the number of one-person households in the US is edging close to a record 40 million, with the share of American households made up of just one person hitting an all-time high of 29%.\n\nThis includes an estimated ~1.3 million extra one-person households in 2025 compared with the prior year, though the Bureau noted that this may be reflective of both demographic changes and methodological updates. Even so, the significant rise over the last decade indicates a broader societal shift that’s been playing out around the globe.\n\nAs noted by The Economist in November, the share of people living alone has increased in 26 out of 30 rich countries since 2010.\n\nMarriage rates are continuing to plummet in the US, as well as in China and many other developed nations, which has coincided with rising incomes and some heated online discourse about traditional relationships. And, like China, the surge in solo dwellings is also being driven at the older end of the demographic spectrum: America’s population aged 65 and older, statistically the most likely cohort to live alone, is expected to keep booming.",

In a Truth Social post on Wednesday, Trump wrote that the US \"needs Greenland\" and \"anything less than that is unacceptable.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Denmark increased its military presence in Greenland, citing \"security tensions.\" Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio also met with the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland on Wednesday.\n\nHere's a look inside Greenland's only US military base.\n\nTrump first expressed interest in buying Greenland, the world's largest island and an autonomous Danish territory, during his first presidency. In addition to being rich in natural resources, Greenland's Arctic location is well-placed to further US interests by countering China and Russia.\n\nSince his reelection, Trump has repeatedly conveyed his desire to acquire Greenland and said he would not rule out the use of military force to take it.\n\n\"We need Greenland for national security. One way or the other we're going to get it,\" he said in his joint address to Congress in March 2025.\n\nBoth Denmark and Greenland's leaders have maintained that the island is not for sale.\n\nSecond lady Usha Vance was originally scheduled to visit Greenland on a solo trip in 2025 to \"visit historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersua, Greenland's national dogsled race,\" the White House said.\n\nInstead, the trip was scaled back. The vice president and second lady visited Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, the US military's northernmost installation, in March.\n\nUsha Vance's solo trip could have violated diplomatic protocol by sending a delegation to another country without an invitation. The amended plan — visiting a US base — avoided that potential violation. While Trump said that \"people from Greenland are asking us to go there,\" the government of Greenland said they had not invited any foreign delegations to visit.\n\n\"Just for the record, Naalakkersuisut, the government of Greenland, has not extended any invitations for any visits, neither private nor official,\" the government's official Facebook page wrote in a post on Monday.\n\nGreenland's then-prime minister, Múte Bourup Egede, also called Usha Vance's planned trip \"very aggressive\" in an interview with Sermitsiaq, a Greenlandic newspaper.\n\nTaylor Van Kirk, JD Vance's press secretary, told Business Insider at the time that the vice president and second lady were \"proud\" to visit the US military base in Greenland.\n\n\"As the vice president has said, previous US leaders have neglected Arctic security, while Greenland's Danish rulers have neglected their security obligations to the island. The security of Greenland is critical in ensuring the security of the rest of the world, and the Vice President looks forward to learning more about the island.\"\n\nWhile the US doesn't own Greenland, it has had a military presence there since World War II.\n\nPituffik Space Base, originally named Thule Air Base, was formally established in 1951 as part of a Cold War-era defense treaty between the US and Denmark. It is located in Pituffik, Greenland, 750 miles north of the Arctic Circle and halfway between New York and Moscow.\n\nAs a Danish territory, Greenland does not have a military of its own.\n\nAs the Pentagon's northernmost military base, Pituffik Space Base acts as a key Arctic defense outpost. Because of its location on the \"top of the world,\" it is an optimal vantage point for monitoring missile launches by US adversaries like Russia and establishing space superiority.\n\nThe base is the site of a phased-array radar, which can detect sea-launched and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and a surface-to-air missile system, which intercepts hostile threats.\n\nThe base has a Satellite Command and Control system to maintain real-time communications and data relay with military and intelligence satellites. Its high-altitude location also allows it to more frequently track polar-orbit satellites, which can monitor the entire Earth's surface over time as the planet rotates below them.\n\nBecause Pituffik's primary mission is space surveillance and missile warning, the space base doesn't house a permanently stationed fighter wing or naval fleet.\n\nInstead, it acts as a strategic logistics and defense hub for Arctic missions and under-ice operations. From the site, which is the world's northernmost deep-water seaport, surface vessels and submarines operated by the US Navy and allied forces conduct Arctic patrols and cold-weather training exercises.\n\nAircraft regularly fly in and out of the former air base, such as military cargo and refueling planes and maritime patrol aircraft. Occasionally, fighter jets and long-range bombers will fly to the base for Arctic deterrence deployments and training flights.\n\nWhile it doesn't have a permanent combat force, the Air Force does have one tugboat at Pituffik to support port operations, icebreaking, and maneuvering ships.\n\nA small but significant asset, the Rising Star helps keep supply routes open by breaking up and pushing floating ice. The tugboat guides supply ships through the port, making it a critical component in bringing fuel, food, and equipment to personnel year-round.\n\nHowever, since the base is locked in by ice for nine months of the year, the Rising Star gets limited use because it can only be operated when the port is completely ice-free.\n\nPituffik Space Base is surrounded by ice for nine months out of every year. The closest town, the Inuit village of Qaanaaq, is located 65 miles away.\n\nTemperatures can range from 60 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer, when there are 24 hours of daylight, to -50 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, when there is no sunlight for weeks.\n\nWinter storms are categorized into five levels from least to most severe: Normal, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, and Delta. At the Bravo level, the buddy system is implemented so that no one walks outside alone. Non-essential facilities close at the Charlie level, and personnel must shelter in place during Delta storms.\n\nAbout 150 personnel are stationed at Pituffik.\n\nThe Dundas Buffet Dining Hall on base serves three meals a day with payments accepted through a meal card.\n\nThe Base Exchange, also known as \"BX,\" sells groceries, toiletries, souvenirs, and other assorted goods. It also houses a barber shop.\n\nThere are no ATMs at Pituffik Space Base, but the Base Exchange accepts debit and credit cards as well as US dollars.\n\nPituffik Space Base features a bowling alley, a chapel, and a community center with a theater and craft room.\n\nThere's also a gymnasium and workout room stocked with weights and treadmills.\n\nPituffik Space Base's official Facebook page shows personnel participating in recreational events such as a Hawaiian-themed Arctic luau party, Greenlandic Heritage Week, and cross-country skiing.\n\nThe US built airbases and weather stations across the ice sheet during World War II as refueling stops on transatlantic flights and supply routes.\n\nTwo decommissioned airbases are now being used as civilian airports, and a third was abandoned after the war ended.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the US Air Force also built four stations on Greenland's coasts as part of a larger communication network of more than 60 radar installations to detect Soviet bombers. Most of the stations have since been deactivated, left to deteriorate atop Greenland's ice sheet.\n\nIn 2024, NASA scientists detected an underground base for a top-secret Cold War-era missile operation known as Camp Century. Now buried 100 feet under the ice, the abandoned network of subterranean tunnels once operated under the guise of an Arctic research facility before the US government declassified it in 1995.\n\nBut the abandoned military sites represent more than just relics of past global conflicts. Thousands of gallons of biological, chemical, and radioactive waste left behind on the bases pose a significant environmental threat, especially as the planet warms.\n\nThe US military failed to clean up decommissioned facilities like Camp Century, assuming the ice sheet would entomb the waste and infrastructure over the years.\n\nHowever, at the current melting rate of the Arctic, researchers estimate that the waste could resurface around 2100. The question remains as to who is responsible for cleaning up the waste from abandoned US military facilities scattered throughout Greenland.\n\nThe US has long pursued access to or control over Greenland due to its strategic and economic significance, dating back as early as the late 19th century.\n\nSince his return to the White House, Trump has continued to double down on his ambitions to secure the self-governing territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, saying he won't rule out military force or economic coercion to do so.\n\nThough the Danish government has remained steadfast in refusing the sale, Trump's so-called \"real estate deal\" has spotlighted Greenland's growing desire for independence from Denmark and disinterest in being owned by anybody, including the US.\n\n\"The time has come to stand together,\" Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said at a press conference on Tuesday, appearing with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. \"It has not been easy to stand up to completely unacceptable pressure from our closest allies for a lifetime. But there is much to suggest that the hardest part is still ahead of us.\"",

    "title": "Trump Imposes Limited Tariffs on Foreign Semiconductors",
    "description": "The tariffs will allow President Trump to take a cut of Nvidia’s chip sales to China while putting off a decision about imposing higher taxes on the chip industry.",
    "fullText": "President Trump signed a proclamation on Wednesday to impose a 25 percent tariff on a narrow list of foreign semiconductors, providing a way for the government to earn revenue off the sale of lucrative chips used in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe tariff, which would take effect Thursday, is far more limited than what the president initially threatened. Last year, the administration began an investigation aimed at encouraging tech companies and chip makers to buy semiconductors made in America. But instead of approving sweeping tariffs that would affect the industry, Wednesday’s announcement showed the administration has settled for narrower levies that allow it to take a cut of artificial intelligence chips sold to China.\n\nA document released by the White House said a 25 percent tariff would be put on A.I. chips made by companies like Nvidia and AMD that are imported into the United States and then re-exported to other countries. The tariff would not apply to semiconductors that are brought into the country to be used domestically in data centers or in products for American consumers, industry or the government. But it would allow the U.S. government to collect revenue from the sale of A.I. chips to China, an idea Mr. Trump proposed last year.\n\nThe president may still impose broader tariffs on semiconductor imports and products containing them in the near future, the White House said, including a program that would provide tariff relief for companies that manufacture chips domestically.\n\nFor now, though, the arrangement will very likely be welcomed by major chip companies that have lobbied fiercely to limit the scope of any tariffs. Most chip companies manufacture the bulk of their products in Taiwan or East Asia, where many of the world’s electronics are made, and ship them into the United States only if they are to be used domestically.\n\nMr. Trump threatened last August to impose a 100 percent tariff on foreign semiconductors unless manufacturers committed to invest in the United States. But chip tariffs had the potential to rankle foreign governments, as well as many of the tech companies that have grown close with the president. The administration has been particularly cautious of disrupting a trade truce that it reached last year with China, a major manufacturer of semiconductors.\n\nThe announcement on Wednesday avoided any such impacts, while also allowing Mr. Trump to realize his plans to take a 25 percent cut of the revenue that Nvidia, the A.I. chip giant, will make from selling advanced chips to China.\n\nMr. Trump first floated the plan in August but was forbidden by U.S. law to tax exports or export licenses. So administration officials proposed a circuitous solution where they would bring Nvidia chips manufactured in Asia into the United States and impose a 25 percent tariff on the imported chip, before re-exporting the products to China.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Commerce issued a rule to permit the sale of a more advanced A.I. chip made by Nvidia, the H200, to China. Mr. Trump had banned the sale of those chips last year out of national security concerns, but abruptly reversed himself after Nvidia argued that exporting the chips was important for American global technology leadership. Nvidia’s chief executive, Jensen Huang, has become one of Mr. Trump’s closest allies in the tech world.\n\nMr. Trump started the chips inquiry under a national security-related law known as Section 232, which he has used to apply tariffs to other sectors, including a 50 percent tariff on all steel imports and a 25 percent tariff on all imported cars.\n\nThe White House also said Wednesday that it had concluded a Section 232 investigation into critical minerals, including lithium, gallium, germanium, cobalt and nickel. An executive order said the administration would refrain from putting tariffs on the sector for now.\n\nInstead, the order directed officials to negotiate trade agreements that would provide the United States more access to critical minerals, which are used in things ranging from cars to airplanes to A.I. data centers. The United States is heavily reliant on other countries — including China — for those minerals.\n\nSome analysts have questioned whether the Trump administration is backing away from heftier tariffs amid rising concerns among Americans about affordability. High prices were a key issue that helped propel Democrats to electoral wins in November. In an economic speech on Tuesday, Mr. Trump called affordability a “fake word by Democrats” but also detailed various steps his administration had taken to lower prices.\n\nBecause semiconductors are in almost everything with an on-off switch, chip companies had warned the administration that more expansive tariffs could lead to widespread price increases across the American economy.\n\nOthers have told the administration that a 25 percent surcharge on the machinery they need to manufacture chips, which can cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, would make semiconductor factories in the United States unviable.\n\nLast year, the United States imported roughly $45 billion in semiconductor chips, primarily from Taiwan and Malaysia, according to Bernstein Research.\n\nMr. Trump had said companies that have committed to building in the United States wouldn’t pay tariffs, and Commerce Department employees have been working on an arrangement that would offer tariff exemptions to companies that invest domestically. Last year, the chief executives of Apple, Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturer, pledged more than $1 trillion in U.S. investments as they sought to avoid fees.\n\nSemiconductor companies have been forced to accept uncertainty under Mr. Trump. Since returning to office, he has threatened to take away government grants, restricted chip sales to China, demanded investments and recommended that one company, Intel, fire its chief executive.\n\nThe intrusions have paralyzed an industry that less than a year earlier signed contracts with the Biden administration to release tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to build factories. Mr. Trump immediately put the industry on edge by criticizing those programs as wasteful, and had his staff ask firms for more investments before releasing the money.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has also seemed attuned to the concerns of tech C.E.O.s, particularly Mr. Huang and Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook. In April, the administration gave the technology industry a lucrative carve-out from its global tariffs, saying electronics would soon be subject to other tariffs under Section 232. No other industry has received such a broad exemption.",

    "fullText": "Venezuela's Chinese air defense radars weren't game-changing during the US raid to capture Maduro.\n\nChina has touted the effectiveness in combat of radars like its JY-27A.\n\nThe lack of effect recently raises questions about both the radar and their operators.\n\nVenezuela's military had Chinese-made anti-aircraft radars available when the US launched a surprise air assault against the country to capture the country's now-former leader, Nicolás Maduro, earlier this month. They appear to have been of little help.\n\nOperation Absolute Resolve involved over 150 US military aircraft, none of which were shot down. A helicopter was hit, reportedly by machine gun fire, but remained operational.\n\nVenezuela has a number of China's JY-27A mobile radars, which Beijing has touted as top-of-the-line systems. It has said the radar can detect stealth assets, like the American F-22 and F-35, from over 150 miles away.\n\nThe success of the surprise raid by US special operators into downtown Caracas, part of a larger mission which involved not only stealth airpower but also older fourth-generation aircraft and helicopters, suggests that something didn't go as planned on defense. That may be on the operators rather than the tech though.\n\nAfter the raid, a Japanese reporter asked a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson what Beijing thought about the \"large amount of military equipment\" China sold Venezuela apparently being \"of little practical use.\" The Chinese spokesperson responded by condemning the US strike.\n\nThe Chinese-made JY-27A is a long-range radar used for detecting and tracking hostile aircraft in protected airpsace. Introduced in 2014, the radar system consists of a radar mast with multiple antenna panels supported by separate radar and control vehicles. Chinese sources claim it has features designed to reduce jamming. A newer version, the JY-27V, has since been developed.\n\nWhen Venezuela purchased JY-27As from China last year, there were claims that the radars were able to lock onto multiple F-35B fighter jets off the Venezuelan coast, presenting a potential challenge to the one-way transparency advantage of the US military.\n\n\"That's all well and good,\" Michael Sobolik, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, told Business Insider, \"but when it really matters is in a moment of conflict.\" Perhaps they were unable to withstand sophisticated electromagnetic spectrum attacks, or maybe they were improperly utilized by their operators.

Some of these pieces are capable but aren't the newest variants used by their respective exporters.\n\nIn the aftermath, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth mocked the effectiveness of the Russian air defenses. Nothing was said about the Chinese radars in that speech.\n\nKey to air defense is how the network works together, and the effectiveness of the operator is vital. In Venezuela's case, it may have been lacking the necessary conditions for successful air defense operations.\n\nA study from the Miami Strategic Intelligence Institute think tank, which hosts experts on Latin America, assessed Venezuela's air defenses as being in critical condition as of last year.\n\nIt said that over 60% of its radar fleet was non-operational, combat aviation doesn't fly often, and the country has received little maintenance support and spare parts from its exporters.\n\nVenezuela purchased Chinese-made radars and Russian-made surface-to-air missile batteries to modernize its air defenses, but the hardware alone can't make up for internal shortcomings.\n\nAnalysis by The New York Times found that some of Venezuela's air defense equipment was in storage or not operational, leaving it unprepared for the US attack.

    "description": "Waymo plans to introduce two new vehicle  platforms to its robotaxi fleet: the Hyundai IONIQ 5 and China's Zeekr, which Waymo is branding, \"Ojai.\"",
    "fullText": "Alphabet-backed Waymo plans to add two new vehicles to its robotaxi fleet in the near future, including a roomier four-seater the company is calling the \"Ojai,\" named after a small southern California city.\n\nThe two cars will be integrated with Waymo's sixth-generation AI driver, which will have a reduced sensor suite.\n\nSandy Karp, a Waymo spokesperson, took Business Insider through a walkthrough of the new robotaxis during the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.\n\nThe Ojai, pictured on the left, is an EV made by Chinese Tesla rival Zeekr.\n\nKarp told Business Insider that Waymo aims to launch Ojai for public riders by 2026. The company has been testing the vehicle in several cities, including San Francisco.\n\nWaymo will also be adding the Hyundai IONIQ 5 SUV to its vehicle lineup.\n\nThe robotaxi company announced a \"multi-year, strategic partnership\" with the South Korean automaker in late 2024.\n\nA launch date for the IONIQ 5 Waymo has not been announced.\n\nWaymo took a deliberate step in removing any Zeekr branding on the Ojai, going as far as adding a Waymo-branded center cap on the wheels.\n\n\"We want people to see and recognize the same trust that they built in Waymo when they look at these vehicles,\" Karp said. \"What we found is people aren't as familiar with the Zeekr brand. So by naming it the Ojai, we're hoping to bring some of that same brand trust and familiarity to the rider experience.\"\n\nKarp said Waymo chose Ojai as a nod to the company's roots in California and to \"inspire a sense of tranquility.\"\n\nThe Ojai is shaped like a minivan but only seats four riders.\n\nKarp said that the Ojai is \"quite roomy\" and will have \"ample storage in the trunk.\"\n\n\"Once you get in, it is so spacious,\" she said. \"I'm not the tallest person in the room, but when I sit in the Ojai, I can really lean back, relax, stick my feet out. It feels like you're riding in first class.\"\n\nShe added that, as regulations change, there could be an opportunity to remove the steering wheel, allowing for another rider.\n\nWaymo's sixth-generation AI driver will have a reduced sensor suite.\n\nThe fifth-generation Waymo Driver, which drives the existing fleet of Jaguar I-PACE SUVs, has 29 cameras, six radars, and five lidars.\n\n\"Basically, we've taken our learnings from driving over a hundred million fully autonomous miles to inform our next generation sensor suite,\" she said. \"So simplified, cost-effective design that's able to scale to more cities, especially with diverse weather conditions.\"\n\nKarp told Business Insider that advancements in sensor technology allow Waymo to reduce the number of sensors.\n\nThe new lidar, for example, has \"higher density,\" or the ability to see further, the spokesperson said.\n\nThe sensor suite is also considerably less clunky.\n\nThe sensors on the roof of the Jaguars are stacked like a tiered wedding cake. The next-generation sensor suite removes the tier and integrates the 360-degree cameras more seamlessly.\n\nSeveral sensors attached to the sixth-generation Waymo Driver also come with sensor-cleaning mechanisms, including tiny windshield wipers and hidden spray nozzles.\n\nThese additions will help the new Waymo Driver perform in harsher weather conditions.\n\nThe Hyundai IONIQ 5 shares some resemblance to Waymo's retrofitted Jaguar.\n\nBoth cars are white, all-electric SUVs that seat four people. Business Insider took a ride in an IONIQ 5 with Motional, Hyundai's robotaxi venture, and found that the space inside the vehicle is similar to the I-PACE.\n\nThe IONIQ 5 will also share the same sensor suite with the Ojai, but will have a variance as to where the sensors are attached. The Hyundai at CES was a show car rather than the actual car that will be on the roads.\n\nKarp could not speak to the number of IONIQs and Ojais Waymo plans to roll out for the initial launch.\n\nJust like any other car, robotaxis don't last forever.\n\nOver time, Waymo will replace the Jaguars with the Hyundai and Ojai, Karp said, \"because you can only have a car running for so long.\"\n\nKarp said that Jaguar discontinued the I-PACE.\n\n\"We've always worked with several OEMs, so it allows us to scale our fleet,\" she said.",

    "description": "When Dylan Rothenberg moved to China, it felt like the Wild West: \"Everything felt negotiable — anything was possible if you were ambitious enough.\"",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dylan Rothenberg, 32, the founder of Wu Mountain Tea. His words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI realized in high school that my academic strength was learning foreign languages.\n\nMy dad did business in China, and his best friend was Chinese, so I've always had a connection to the country.\n\nWhen I was 15, I went to China to stay with a host family for six months as part of a US government-sponsored full-immersion program. It was in 2009, the golden era of US-China relations.\n\nAt 19, I decided to major in Chinese and economics at the University of Colorado, Boulder.\n\nI spent my junior year abroad in Beijing at Peking University. After six months, I started working as a translator.\n\nI sat in on negotiations with company founders, one of whom ran a tea company. He tasked me with buying tea and shipping it out to Geneva.\n\nI decided to take a temporary leave from school and moved to Guangzhou, home to the world's largest tea market.\n\nChina felt like the Wild West. At the time, nothing was black and white. Everything felt negotiable — anything was possible if you were ambitious enough.\n\nIn the market, I was haggling for goods and negotiating. It was pure adrenaline. I'd see the address of a manufacturer on the back of a packet of tea in the convenience store, then head to that address and start talking to the factory owner.\n\nWhen I was in a factory waiting for tea bags to be produced, a guy invited me to meet his professor, who specialized in tea at the South China Agricultural University. The professor told me to come back to Guangzhou after I graduated, and he'd teach me everything he knew about tea. He told me I'd be his first American tea graduate.\n\nI felt he was offering me a chance to be exceptional at one thing. After talking to my parents, I decided I wanted to focus on tea as a career after completing my bachelor's.\n\nI founded my company, Wu Mountain Tea, in 2015. Two years later, I started my master's degree in tea science and went on to earn a Ph.D. — both completed in China.\n\nHere, I've been able to form deeper personal connections. My best friends are Chinese, and I have close ties with lab colleagues and my gym bros.\n\nOne of my friends grew up in Wushan, the area of Guangzhou where I live, which means \"five mountains.\" I call him my \"sixth mountain.\"\n\nI see my professors two or three times a week. The relationship with teachers here is much closer than in the US. We drink together, have dinner at their homes, and discuss research in real time.\n\nI'll miss China's high-speed rail. It connects cities the size of New York or Chicago with metro-like efficiency. I travel often.\n\nGuangzhou to Shanghai — a distance of 1,500 kilometers, or 930 miles — takes seven hours, and I can arrive 20 minutes before departure and just scan my passport. Then I'm whipping along at 250 kilometers an hour. In the US, traveling equivalent distances is a logistical issue.\n\nThe shrimp dumpling, xiajiao, is my favorite morsel on earth. I can get a serving of roast duck in my campus dining hall for just 6 yuan, around 85 cents, and it's better than any duck dish in New York City's Chinatown.\n\nThe biggest struggle here is that strangers stare at me and point at me. I'm like an alien walking around. Even if they're not saying anything malicious about me, it's upsetting.\n\nIn New York State, where I'm from, you can't really make eye contact like that. It provokes confrontation. And here, I can't just lose my cool when someone is staring or laughing at me. For the last three years, I haven't left the house without a low-brimmed hat.\n\nAt the same time, I know I'm doing something unique. My YouTube channel, dedicated to tea, has more than 50,000 subscribers. If my business continues to grow, I could see myself staying in China — but for now, my plan is to return to the US.\n\nI grew up in Syracuse, the snowiest city in the US. I skied 120 days a year and was an alpine ski racer at a competitive level. I'm more comfortable on skis than on my own two feet.\n\nIn Guangzhou, there's no snow at all. I've been far away from what I love the most for the last 10 years. I plan to move back to Salt Lake City in a couple of years, so I can be closer to the mountains and my family.\n\nDo you have a story about living in Asia that you want to share?

    "fullText": "A former U.S. Navy sailor convicted of selling technical and operating manuals for ships and operating systems to an intelligence officer working for China was sentenced Monday to more than 16 years in prison, prosecutors said.\n\nA federal judge in San Diego sentenced Jinchao Wei, 25, to 200 months. A federal jury convicted Wei in August of six crimes, including espionage. He was paid more than $12,000 for the information he sold, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement.\n\nWei, an engineer for the amphibious assault ship USS Essex, was one of two California-based sailors charged on Aug. 3, 2023, with providing sensitive military information to China. The other, Wenheng Zhao, was sentenced to more than two years in 2024 after he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and one count of receiving a bribe in violation of his official duties.\n\nU.S. officials have for years expressed concern about the espionage threat they say the Chinese government poses, bringing criminal cases in recent years against Beijing intelligence operatives who have stolen sensitive government and commercial information, including through illegal hacking.\n\nWei was recruited via social media in 2022 by an intelligence officer who portrayed himself as a naval enthusiast working for the state-owned China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, prosecutors said.\n\nEvidence presented in court showed Wei told a friend that the person was “extremely suspicious” and that it was “quite obviously” espionage. Wei disregarded the friend's advice to delete the contact and instead moved conversations with the intelligence officer to a different encrypted messaging app Wei believed was more secure, prosecutors said.\n\nOver the course of 18 months, Wei sent the officer photos and videos of the Essex, advised him of the location of various Navy ships and told him about the Essex's defensive weapons, prosecutors said.\n\nWei sold the intelligence officer 60 technical and operating manuals, including those for weapons control, aircraft and deck elevators. The manuals contained export control warnings and detailed the operations of multiple systems aboard the Essex and similar ships.\n\nHe was a petty officer second class, which is a enlisted sailor's rank.\n\nThe Navy's website says the Essex is equipped to transport and support a Marine Corps landing force of over 2,000 troops during an air and amphibious assault.\n\nIn a letter to the judge before sentencing, Wei apologized and said he shouldn’t have shared anything with the person who he had considered a friend. Wei said “introversion and loneliness” clouded his judgment.",

    "fullText": "An app that asks a blunt question — \"Are you dead?\" — has become a hit in China.\n\nThe app, called \"Si Le Me\" (Chinese for \"are you dead\"), requires users to \"check in\" by pressing a button. If they fail to do so for two consecutive days, the app alerts an emergency contact.\n\nDesigned for people living alone, \"Si Le Me\" has surged to become the most popular paid download on China's Apple App Store this week. It costs 8 yuan, or $1.15, to download. The app was launched in mid-2025, but its downloads only surged in early January, according to Chinese media reports.\n\nIts stark, literal name has struck a nerve on Chinese social media, triggering raw discussions about loneliness and the risks of living alone.\n\nSolo living is becoming increasingly common in China, among both young city dwellers and the growing population of old people living independently.\n\nChina could have as many as 200 million one-person households by 2030, with more than 30% of people living alone, according to projections published in 2021 by Beike Research Institute, a real-estate research firm.\n\nA government survey in 2021 found that nearly 60% of Chinese age 60 and above lived alone or only with a spouse, up about 10 percentage points from 2010.\n\nOne of the app's creators told Chinese media the idea grew out of online conversations about safety and isolation among people living alone. The three co-creators were all born in the mid-1990s.\n\nThe app's sudden rise has sparked a wave of discussion on Chinese social media, with users interpreting its popularity as a symptom of deeper loneliness.\n\nA user who goes by Qian Wei said in their post on RedNote on Monday that they \"sense a deep loneliness\" behind the app's success.\n\nFor much of China's history, kinship formed the basic unit of society, but \"this structure has completely collapsed\" in the present day, they wrote.\n\n\"In big cities, everyone is an isolated, atomized individual. People live in soundproof apartments, not knowing the surname of their neighbors,\" they wrote in their post.\n\n\"This creates an extremely intense fear, which is commonly known as 'lonely death,'\" they added.\n\nOther RedNote users echoed the sentiment, describing the app's popularity as a collective \"cry of loneliness.\"\n\nAnother user who goes by Huang Mu Xin Sheng wrote on RedNote on Tuesday that the app made them feel \"extremely uneasy\" because it reduces existence itself to a functional task.\n\nThe app has also stirred debate over its stark name. Some users referred to it as inauspicious, likening it to a curse and urging the creators to rename it. Others said they were willing to pay 8 yuan for peace of mind.\n\nNot all reactions were somber. One RedNote user described the app as a form of \"meme-style stress relief,\" a lighthearted way for young people to cope with mounting pressure.\n\nAnother user framed the app as a source of certainty in an era when life feels increasingly out of control.\n\n\"I check in, therefore I am,\" they wrote.",

    "fullText": "After holding onto the record for possessing the world's most powerful centrifuge (or hypergravity machine) for close to three decades, the U.S. ceded that title to China in 2025. When China's new hypergravity machine — the CHIEF1300 — came online in September 2025, it yanked the title from the centrifuge installed in the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center's (ERDC) Centrifuge Research Complex (CRC) located at Vicksburg, Mississippi. The CHIEF1300's (CHIEF is short for Centrifugal Hypergravity and Interdisciplinary Experiment Facility) reign at the top, however, would only last a few months. In December 2025, China commissioned another even more powerful centrifuge, the CHIEF1900, which is currently the world's most powerful centrifuge.\n\nHypergravity centrifuges are machines designed to produce gravitational forces thousands of times stronger than that of the Earth. They do this by rotating at extremely high speeds and, in the process, creating artificial gravity. These machines have been used by agencies like NASA and ESA for various research purposes, ranging from earthquake simulations, dam failures, and the impact of a high gravity environment on living things. In contrast to hypergravity centrifuges, there are also machines that simulate gravity lower than Earth's.\n\nChina on Monday launched the world's largest centrifuge in terms of capacity, capable of generating 300 times Earth's gravity for a load up to 20 tonnes. The machine, coded CHIEF1300, is one of the core components of the Centrifugal Hypergravity and Interdisciplinary Experiment... pic.twitter.com/3ljFrx334o\n\n— China Science (@ChinaScience) September 29, 2025\n\nAs for the claim that these machines compress space and time, it doesn't actually work the way you may have imagined. One of the purposes of these machines is to test small models of huge structures like dams or foundations. Under high gravity, these tiny models feel the same forces a real-world structure would feel, so a small setup behaves like something much larger. Higher gravity also makes slow processes like soil settling or water flow accelerate, so years of real-world behavior can be observed in days or weeks. This is how hypergravity machines can \"compress\" space and time.\n\nThe capacity of large centrifuges is measured using a unit called g·tonnes (gravity-tonnes). A centrifuge that most people use in their daily lives is a typical washing machine, which, during its fastest spin cycle, generates close to 2 g.tonnes of effective force. The long-time record-holding U.S. centrifuge at Vicksburg was rated at 1,200 g·tonnes — already hundreds of times more powerful than anything encountered in everyday life. China's CHIEF1300 pushed that to 1,300 g.tonnes. The current record holder — the CHIEF1900 — takes it much further, and if not evident already, it is rated to generate up to 1,900 g.tonnes of force.\n\nBoth of China's record-breaking hypergravity centrifuges are located at the CHIEF facility, which is part of the Zhejiang University campus in Hangzhou and has been under construction since 2019. The facility is located 49 feet below ground — a move aimed at minimizing vibrations that could be generated while operating these centrifuges.\n\nWhile the CHIEF1900 has just been installed, its predecessor — the CHIEF1300 — has already been used for several experiments. Notable among these is a study that measured the amount of seismic energy a hydropower-focused dam foundation can withstand. Another group of scientists used it to study the effect of large waves on the seabed. These included looking at the impact of 13-foot high wind-driven waves and a massive 65-foot tsunami on the seabed. The aim of this study was to ascertain if the chosen site is a good candidate to install an offshore wind farm. The CHIEF1300 was also able to reproduce the extreme pressure experienced at depths of around 2000 meters (6500 feet) in the ocean.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "description": "Lower Chinese LNG demand could pressure global markets, especially as new U.S. and Qatari capacity comes online and Russian pipeline and LNG exports to China increase.",
    "fullText": "China is boosting domestic natural gas production, and it is doing it fast. A major LNG consumer—and importer—the country has been key in LNG demand forecasts. Now, these forecasts will need to be revised.\n\nLess than ten years ago, China was struggling to get its domestic gas production off the ground, especially in shale formations. China’s shale geology is different from the U.S. basins, and energy companies were finding it difficult to get commercial production going. Now, China’s state oil and gas majors are pumping more gas than ever and announcing new discoveries in the shale patch.\n\nIn November last year, China produced 22.1 billion cu m, which was a 7.1% increase on the year, Kpler reported this month citing official production data. The increase was driven by “faster-than-expected shale gas ramp-ups in the Sichuan Basin.” Based on that data, the energy analytics firm expects China’s total for 2025 to reach 263 billion cu m, rising to 278.5 billion cu m this year, again thanks to growing shale gas production in the Sichuan and Shanxi basins.\n\nAs with oil, rising domestic production would inevitably affect imports, even as China leans more heavily on natural gas for emission-reduction purposes. Last year, for instance, China booked higher domestic gas production and a rather substantial decline in LNG imports. In fact, imports of liquefied gas last year fell to the lowest in six years after a string of 12 monthly declines in a row. Imports only rebounded at the end of the year but not enough to reverse the decline. Kpler has predicted that Chinese demand for liquefied natural gas is going to decline this year as well, with shale gas production removing some 600,000 tons of LNG demand, reducing the total to 73.9 million tons.\n\nNow, 600,000 tons is not a whole lot in the context of a market where the United States alone exported over 100 million tons last year. But it does serve as yet another evidence of a trend in China to reduce dependence on energy imports, which has implications for global energy commodity markets that have gotten used to relying on China as the ultimate driver of demand.\n\nThe projected decline in China’s demand for gas—and by extension LNG—may interfere with new LNG capacity addition plans and prices, shrinking producers’ profits. It is these plans for a wave of new LNG supply, set to come online by the end of the decade, mostly from the top exporters, the United States and Qatar, that have prompted many analysts to expect an oversupplied LNG market by 2030 that would weigh on prices.",

    "description": "By exceeding a long-standing density barrier, China’s EAST fusion reactor proved that tokamaks can pack way more atoms into its plasma.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nThe plasma density barrier is a mathematical limit to the density of plasma that can exist in a tokamak before destabilizing.\n\nA new study led by a team of scientists in China shows that this limit can be surpassed by carefully controlling the interaction between the reactor wall and the plasma from start-up.\n\nThis could help improve conditions to create nuclear ignition within the plasma, providing energy based on the fiery science at the heart of our Sun.\n\nIn the race for clean energy, no technology is quite as promising as nuclear fusion, but the road toward energy freedom is filled with barriers that scientists must find ways to circumvent or otherwise innovate their way through.\n\nOne of those limitations is what’s known as the plasma density barrier, or the Greenwald limit (named after American physicist Martin Greenwald who discovered the limit in 1988). Put simply, this limit mathematically describes the upper limit of the number of atoms that can be in a plasma before destabilization due to atoms from the tokamak’s metal wall interacting with the plasma itself. However, the big piece of good news with the Greenwald limit is that this isn’t a physical law, but rather a mathematical description of a well-documented phenomenon, meaning there’s possibly a way to engineer our way around this density barrier.\n\nScientists at Chinese Academy of Sciences, operating the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) reactor, in Hefei, China, may have just charted that path. In a new study published in the journal Science Advances, the authors detail the achievement of a “density-free regime” by carefully balancing the interaction of the plasma and the reactor’s walls via plasma-wall self organization (PWSO).\n\nTypically, the soup of atoms known as plasma eventually grows to such a point that atoms with the reactor’s wall interact with it, supercharging the cooling process and eventually leading to destabilization. But in this study, scientists controlled that interaction from start-up by controlling the initial fuel gas pressure and applying an electron cyclotron resonance heating for each discharge. Because plasma-wall interactions were organized from the beginning, the tokamak successfully achieved plasma densities 65 percent beyond the Greenwald limit.\n\n“The findings suggest a practical and scalable pathway for extending density limits in tokamaks and next-generation burning plasma fusion devices,\" Huazhong University of Science and Technology Ping Zhu, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement.\n\nWhile the fusion world eagerly awaits the construction of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in southern France, the EAST reactor in China is one of the leading tokamak reactors in the world. Last year, the reactor successfully contained high-confinement plasma for nearly 17 minutes, smashing their previous record of 403 seconds. The goal now, according to Zhu, is to all achieve this density-free regime under high-performance plasma conditions.\n\nOf course, reliably surpassing the Greenwald limit won’t magically open the doors to a world powered by fusion. Many hurdles remain, particularly developing exotic materials capable of handling the hellish conditions of nuclear fusion for (ideally) many years. Luckily, China is a major partner in the ITER program, so any lessons learned at EAST will be applied to humanity’s greatest attempt at bottling the Sun.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "Vietnam's Communist Party chief To Lam is seeking to combine his party role with the state presidency, officials said, in a move that would align",
    "fullText": "HANOI, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Vietnam's Communist Party chief To Lam is seeking to combine his party role with the state presidency, officials said, in a move that would align Vietnam's political structure more closely to China's ​where President Xi Jinping heads the party and state.\n\nNext week some 1,600 delegates will gather in Hanoi to kick off ‌a week-long Communist Party congress, held every five years to select new leaders and set policy goals for the single-party state.\n\nLam, 68, bid for both top positions ‌at a party meeting in December, seeking initial party approval ahead of the congress, three people briefed by the delegates and another three officials familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nWhile the sources said the party meeting backed Lam to remain party chief, the three people briefed by delegates gave differing accounts on the question of the presidency, a largely ceremonial role but one currently held by the military.\n\nTwo said Lam won support ⁠for his bid, while the third said the ‌conclusion was unclear. In any case, the final decision rests with delegates who will be elected at the congress.\n\nThe party's secretariat did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe combination of the two top ‍jobs for the next five years would mark a significant departure from Vietnam's traditional power-sharing model. Only in exceptional periods after the death of incumbents have the positions been merged, including in 2024 when Lam held both positions for about three months.\n\nShould Lam succeed, the military, a powerful faction ​within the party, would give up the presidency in exchange for maintaining a broad autonomy over the promotion of its senior officers, ‌two sources said.\n\nOne official said military leaders are negotiating \"safeguards\" to limit Lam's authority. The defence ministry was not immediately available for comment.\n\nIn possible signs of early concessions, some controversial economic policies pursued under Lam's first term were revised or faced unexpected hurdles ahead of the congress, including on credit growth and a high-speed railway.\n\nSupporters of combining the two roles argue all other communist countries - China, North Korea, Cuba and Laos - vest both positions in a single leader, and note the move would bolster Lam's economic reform agenda and strengthen his standing ⁠in meetings with foreign leaders.\n\nSceptics see the change as emboldening a leader seen ​as a risk-taker who has already vastly expanded the powers of the security apparatus.\n\nThe ​merger would be \"the natural outcome of streamlining Vietnam's political structure,\" said Carl Thayer, a senior expert on Vietnam at the Australian Defence Force Academy, noting Lam has already effectively taken over some of the president's powers with ‍frequent overseas trips last year.\n\nStarting January ⁠19, the week-long congress will elect 200 members of the new central committee, with a large number of newcomers expected to join, raising questions about whether they will confirm decisions made by the roughly 140 delegates who voted in December.\n\nThe central ⁠committee will elect the party chief and the politburo. Lam in July said the new politburo will have 17-19 members, but the size will depend on delegates' ‌votes on a pre-arranged shortlist.\n\nThe politburo will then nominate the president, prime minister and speaker of the parliament, whose ‌appointments lawmakers must confirm.",

    "fullText": "Reigning Masters champion Shaun Murphy was eliminated on day one of the 2026 event, losing 6-2 to China's Wu Yize in the first round.\n\nMurphy, who beat Kyren Wilson to win the Triple Crown event for a second time a year ago, lost the opening three frames and, despite taking frame four, then lost the fifth on a black-ball finish.\n\nWu, 22, is ranked 13th in the world and picked up his first ranking title in November when he won the International Championship in Yanjing in his home country, beating world champions Judd Trump, Zhao Xintong and John Higgins along the way.\n\nOn his Alexandra Palace debut, Wu made a superb clearance of 137 in frame two and a break of 56 in frame seven.\n\nHe will play either current UK champion Mark Selby or China's Xiao Guodong in the quarter-finals on Thursday.\n\n\"I felt a bit of pressure when I entered the stadium because it was the first time I've played in such a big stadium and the fans were so enthusiastic,\" said Wu.\n\n\"After the first frame, I felt a bit more relaxed and I totally enjoyed the atmosphere. It's definitely a great achievement for myself - my first time playing at the Masters and the first time beating Shaun Murphy.\"\n\nFor 43-year-old Murphy, who reached the semi-final of the UK Championship last month, it was a disappointing afternoon with him failing to register a single break of 50.\n\n\"I've been looking forward to today for a year, walking out as champion, but I enjoyed the first 10 minutes,\" said Murphy. \"I didn't play well, certainly the worst performance of my season, maybe the worst in the Masters.\n\n\"I'm very disappointed. None of it was there. I felt everything I touched was not there. I've been working very hard, practising hard, playing a lot of snooker, so I didn't expect to play like that and I'm as shocked as anyone.\n\n\"Wu looked calm, looked at ease and fully deserved his win. He will be a handful for anyone he plays.\"",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will urge Group of Seven nations and others to step up their efforts to reduce reliance on critical minerals from China when he hosts a dozen top finance ​officials on Monday, a senior U.S. official said.\n\nThe meeting, which kicks off with a dinner on Sunday evening, will include ‌finance ministers or cabinet ministers from the G7 advanced economies, the European Union, Australia, India, South Korea and Mexico, said the official who was not authorized to speak ‌publicly.\n\nTogether, the grouping accounts for 60% of global demand for critical minerals.\n\n\"Urgency is the theme of the day. It's a very big undertaking. There's a lot of different angles, a lot of different countries involved and we really just need to move faster,\" the official said.\n\nBessent on Friday told Reuters that he had been pressing for a separate meeting on the issue since a G7 leaders summit in Canada in June, where he ⁠delivered a rare earths presentation to gathered heads ‌of state from the U.S., Britain, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and the European Union.\n\nLeaders agreed to an action plan at the summit to secure their supply chains and boost their economies, but Bessent has grown ‍frustrated about the lack of urgency demonstrated by attendees, the official said.\n\nAside from Japan, which took action after China abruptly cut off its critical minerals supplies in 2010, G7 members remain heavily dependent on critical minerals from China, which has threatened to impose strict export controls.\n\nChina dominates the critical minerals supply chain, ​refining between 47% and 87% of copper, lithium, cobalt, graphite and rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency. These minerals are used ‌in defense technologies, semiconductors, renewable energy components, batteries and refining processes.\n\nThe U.S. is expected to issue a statement after the meeting, but no specific joint action is likely, the official added.\n\n“The United States is in the posture of calling everyone together, showing leadership, sharing what we have in mind going forward,\" said the official. \"We're ready to move with those who feel a similar level of urgency ... and others can join as they come to the realization of how serious this is.\"\n\nThe official gave no details on what ⁠further steps were planned by the Trump administration, which is pushing forward to ​boost domestic production and reduce reliance on China through agreements with Australia, Ukraine and ​other producers.",

    "fullText": "Swedish producer is trying to to accelerate the process of extracting the elements vital for hi-tech products\n\nIt is deep winter with temperatures dropping to -20C. The sun never rises above the horizon, instead bathing Sweden’s most northerly town of Kiruna in a blue crepuscular light, or “civil twilight” as it is known, for two or three hours a day stretching visibility a few metres, notwithstanding heavy snow.\n\nBut 900 metres below the arctic conditions, a team of 20 gather every day, forgoing the brief glimpse of natural light and spearheading the EU’s race to mine its own rare earths. Despite identification of several deposits around the continent, and some rare earth refineries including Solvay in France, there are no operational rare earth mines in Europe.\n\nAcross the globe, the scramble for rare earths has become the source of huge geopolitical tension, with China accused last year by the EU of “weaponising” its near monopoly on raw materials and end products, essential for everything from smartphones, to electric cars, to fridges, music speakers and military jets.\n\nChina’s willingness to slap export bans on rare earths led to the vicious trade war with Donald Trump last year and is partly driving his current bid to take over Greenland, which is rich in these materials, now among the most precious in the world.\n\nEvery day the team at LKAB mine in Kiruna drive 4km (2.5 miles) down an impressive network of tunnels to get closer to what is known as the Per Geijer deposit of magnetite-hematite-phosphate named after the Swedish geologist who identified it more than 100 years ago.\n\nThe team are now operating at two levels – 900m and 1.3km deep underground as they try to connect the existing vast iron ore mine in Kiruna with Per Geijer about 2km away.\n\nUsing remote technology they drill a fan of 84 holes in the rock face; pump them with explosives which are then blasted between 1.15am and 1.45am every night, sometimes disturbing the inhabitants overground, and causing subsidence that has led to the state-owned compamy moving parts of the town and its church.\n\nLess than four hours later the team are back.\n\n“At 5am in the morning, when we have ventilated out the blasting fumes, we start the mucking out,” says 37-year-old Kiruna native Jim Lidström, who leads the tunnelling to what is one of Europe’s largest deposits of rare earths.\n\nOnce cleared, a separate team of men and women, sitting in a modern console centre 1.3k below ground, “scale” the rock, remotely controlling machines that break the detritus into transportable chunks for onward transport to a driverless train.\n\nLidström’s team then set about making the tunnel stable and usable, drilling bolts into the freshly made walls and then spraying it with a layer of concrete or “shotcrete” before the whole process starts all over again.\n\n“We do about five metres a day,” Lidström says.\n\nThe hunt for rare earths is slow.\n\nThe 17 rare earth elements – all found in Kiruna – include neodymium and praseodymium, critical materials for the powerful permanent magnets needed for everything from electric cars to household appliances and military jets.\n\nAlthough geological surveys show large ore bodies across the west – including the Fen complex in Norway, thought to be Europe’s largest deposit – from mine to refined end production could take 10 to 15 years, say experts.\n\n“I think people often miss the point. They say ‘why don’t we just produce rare earths in Europe?’. But you have to have the entire supply chain to do that,” says Nigel Steward, a professor at Imperial College London, a materials scientist and a former executive in the US mining industry.\n\nThe experience in Kiruna shows just how challenging it is to reduce the EU’s dependency on China, which is now the core supplier of rare earth magnets and willing to choke supplies, as it did last year, if politically desirable.\n\nState-owned LKAB is now trying to accelerate the process of mining, extraction, and separation of the crumbs from the ore, to help the EU de-risk as quickly as possible.\n\nJan Moström, the chief executive of LKAB, explains that it could take “years and years” if the company tried to expose the entire length of the Per Geijer deposit for mining purposes.\n\n“But that is not what we are going to do. What we are going to do is to open up incrementally,” he says.\n\nHe refuses to give a timeline because of its sensitivity, instead explaining the complex task ahead in the vast network of tunnels circling the deposit.\n\n“The main focus for us now in the Kiruna system is to find a mine design to deal with the mining of the present reserves down to the main level, at 1,365 metres , then to work out how we go beneath that and develop that resource into reserves, and also how to connect the Per Geijer deposit into the [existing iron ore mining] system. We will start to develop it incrementally, and that is the huge difference [from previous approaches],” he says.\n\nFor Moström, who has spent his career in mines, the last 11 with LKAB, the stranglehold Beijing has built in rare earths was no accident, and something he has been pressing home in Brussels repeatedly.\n\nAs the US and Europe started to regulate against toxic waste in the 1980s, China which had none of the environmental concerns, ploughed on charring the landscape as it went building a chokehold on raw materials now critical for modern life.\n\n“I’ve been talking in Brussels the past two or three years about the huge disadvantages we created in the 1970s and the 1980s when we closed the mining industry and started importing metals from South America, Africa, Australia,” he says.\n\nAsked why it has taken the EU so long to wake up to the dangers of dependency on China’s rare earth supply, he is blunt: “Politicians will never be more courageous than the voters.”\n\n“Nobody saw any future in mining, then the super-cycle started and China started to consume enormous volumes of metals,” he says referring to the boom at the turn of the century when China drove a huge commodities boom on the back of urbanisation.\n\n“I have the perception that the European Commission, the commissioners, really understand the importance of domestic mining and some sort of self-sufficiency,” Moström says.\n\nAs part of the acceleration efforts, LKAB has put €80m (£69m) into a new “demonstration” plant in nearby Luleå to test the process of separation before mining even begins. It has also taken a stake in the Norwegian company REEtec to develop an environmentally friendly way of refining the extract.\n\nContrary to what the name suggests, rare earths – a group of 17 soft metals with unique properties such as strong magnetismor high temperature resistance – are not rare.\n\nSpeckled like crumbs in the earth’s crust, the tag “rare” stuck because of the difficulty accessing them, mining them, and separating them from the ore in which they are found, a process that can take a decade.\n\nLKAB has already been visited by a line of Brussels dignitaries, including industry commissioner Stéphane Séjourné in September, because is represents the EU’s best current hope of weaning itself of a dependency on Chinese supplies that has left Europe vulnerable to increasing geopolitical tensions.\n\nDespite the rhetoric in Brussels, London and Washington over the need to wean industries off China, Beijing will hold the rare earth cards for years to come.\n\n“Right now China controls 85% of the final processing of light rare earths and it control 100% of the heavy rare earths,” says Darren Wilson, the chief executive of LKAB’s industrial minerals division.\n\nAccording to senior European Commission officials in December the EU uses 20,000 tonnes of permanent magnets, a year of which 17,000 to 18,000 come from China, creating an unbalanced and high-risk trade relationship.\n\nLast April, in retaliation against Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, China imposed global export restrictions on rare earths, hitting Europe’s car industry. It threatened to impose more restrictions in October, until a 12-month truce was agreed with Trump at in Korea the same month.\n\nAs George Riddell, a senior adviser at Flint Global and a trade expert, says: “China has not just got the capacity to weaponise its trade but shown it has the willingness to do so.”\n\nAll hopes rest on LKAB now being the first to reduce the EU’s reliance on China, with a pre-existing highly developed mining operation employing about 2,000 workers directly and double that indirectly.\n\nMagnetic properties of some metals were discovered by the Greeks 4,000 years ago.\n\nPermanent magnets, found in speakers, headphones, toys, cars and military equipment are typically manufactured from a neodymium-iron-boron alloy.\n\nThe process begins by melting suitable raw materials, placing them into a mould that is then chilled, resulting in a powder. All the particles have then to align in the right direction to create a powerful magnetic force. The powder is sintered in a furnace, bonding the particles together into a mass that is then cut for final use.\n\nPermanent magnets were developed in the research department of the General Motors Company in the US and by the Japanese materials scientist Masato Sagawa in the 1980s.\n\nBut making these powerful magnets generates radioactive byproducts that can contaminate water and soil.\n\nAs the west introduced environmental regulations in the 1980s, US rare earth suppliers “started exporting their product to China because they were willing to process it,” says Imperial College London’s Steward.\n\nGM is now working with Mountain Pass, the only operational rare earth mine in the US, which is thought to be about two years away from producing products for the American market.\n\n“There is no reason why we can’t remake magnets. They were our inventions, in the west. That is the crazy thing,” Steward says.",

The main bottlenecks are production capacity, including lithography machines, and the software ecosystem,\" Yao said at an AI ‍conference in Beijing.\n\nChina has completed a working prototype of an extreme-ultraviolet lithography machine potentially capable of producing cutting-edge semiconductor chips that rival the West's, Reuters reported last month. However, the machine has not yet produced working chips and may not do ​so until 2030, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\nYao and other Chinese industry ‌leaders at the Beijing conference on Saturday also acknowledged that the U.S. maintains an advantage in computing power due to its hefty investments in infrastructure.\n\n\"The U.S. computer infrastructure is likely one to two orders of magnitude larger than ours. But I see that whether it's OpenAI or other platforms, they're investing heavily in next-generation research,\" said Lin Junyang, technical lead for Alibaba's flagship Qwen large language model.\n\n\"We, on the other hand, are relatively strapped for ⁠cash; delivery alone likely consumes the majority of our computer infrastructure,\" ​Lin said during a panel discussion at the AGI-Next Frontier Summit ​held by the Beijing Key Laboratory of Foundational Models at Tsinghua University.\n\nLin said China's limited resources have spurred its researchers to be innovative, particularly through algorithm-hardware co-design, which enables AI ‍firms to run large models ⁠on smaller, inexpensive hardware.",

    "description": "The U.S. is considering buying Greenland to secure its strategic interests in the Arctic, as Russia and China invest heavily in the region, and a negotiated transfer with compensation for Denmark would be the most effective way to secure the territory without resorting to force.",
    "fullText": "The White House is speaking loudly about Greenland. But volume should not be mistaken for madness. This isn’t a sudden lapse into imperial fantasy — it is power politics, plain and unsentimental, dressed in modern language but driven by old truths.\n\nGeography still governs fate. Distance can still protect or imperils nations. Ice still melts, routes still open, and rivals still move. Greenland sits at the center of it all — a vast slab of territory that dominates the map not by population, but by consequence.\n\nSet aside the outrage and the pearl-clutching, and the case becomes clear. Seen through a realist lens — the kind John Mearsheimer describes — power is never polite. Nations do not glide through history on good will. They compete, maneuver, and block rivals wherever they can.\n\nAmerica didn’t invent this contest, but it has played it for a century, shaping trade routes, locking down strategic chokepoints, and denying rivals room to expand. Exiting now would not end the game — it would simply forfeit the advantage.\n\nGreenland matters because the Arctic matters. Melting ice has turned what was once a frozen buffer into a contested corridor. Shipping lanes are emerging. Subsea cables snake across the ocean floor. Missile paths shorten. Surveillance gaps narrow. Russia knows this. China knows this. Both are investing heavily in Arctic presence, infrastructure and influence. The U.S. can either treat Greenland as a distant curiosity or as what it actually is: a forward position in a region that will define future power balances.\n\nThis is why the talk of acquiring it refuses to die. Under Trump, it has resurfaced less from recklessness than from bluntness. He says aloud what others preferred to bury in briefings. Previous administrations whispered the same concerns behind closed doors, then settled for half-measures and cosmetic compromises. Trump simply said the quiet part out loud, with his usual lack of decorum and surplus of disruption. Allies recoiled. But in cold political terms, offense is secondary to advantage.\n\nThe preferred path is obvious and needs no justification. Buying Greenland is better than bullying it. A negotiated transfer, with guarantees for Greenlanders and compensation for Denmark, would be cleaner, cheaper, and far less destabilizing than any military move. War in the Arctic would be absurd, expensive and counterproductive. Even floating the idea of force is less about intent than leverage. It is a reminder that the U.S. takes the matter seriously, not a rehearsal for invasion.\n\nCritics insist Greenland’s future is not Washington’s to decide. Formally, they are right. Strategically, however, that statement is comforting nonsense. In a world of rising rivalry, no great power allows vital terrain to drift into adversarial hands out of courtesy. Sovereignty is sacred until security is threatened; then it becomes negotiable. This isn’t cynicism, but the hard ledger of history.\n\nThe U.S. bought Louisiana not out of generosity, but to deny France control of the Mississippi. It backed Panama’s break from Colombia to secure a canal it deemed vital. It purchased Alaska to keep Russia away from its doorstep. Britain took Gibraltar for the same reason: Position beats principle when survival is involved. States talk reverently about borders, right up until borders threaten them. When security tightens, ideals are revised.\n\nThe European backlash, while predictable, is also revealing. Europe benefits enormously from American security guarantees, but recoils whenever Washington acts like a power rather than a charity. There is something faintly comic about NATO allies warning the U.S. against taking its own defense too seriously. The alliance rests, after all, on the assumption that America has never been a feelings-first power. Greenland reveals whether it still remembers that.\n\nEuropean nations insist Greenland is not for sale, while quietly relying on American troops, money and missiles to keep the peace that permits such comfortable posturing. It is a bit like lecturing the fire brigade on property rights while borrowing their hoses. Principles are easier to defend when someone else pays the insurance.\n\nThe deeper issue is not Trump’s rhetoric but America’s reluctance to admit what it is. The U.S. remains a global power in a competitive world. It cannot afford strategic blind spots disguised as virtue. Greenland is not a vanity project or a colonial hangover — it is a strategic anchor, a surveillance platform, a logistical hub, and a denial asset, all wrapped up into one. To lose influence there would not cause immediate collapse, but it would mark a significant retreat, the kind rivals notice long before voters do.\n\nThat is why this moment feels different. The language is sharper. The signals are stronger. Force remains the last resort, and rightly so. It is expensive, corrosive and unpredictable. Buying Greenland would cost money and pride, but far less than conflict. Realism doesn’t require hostility. The United States has often secured vital positions without resorting to force.\n\nIt gained long-term access to Iceland during World War II because the island mattered more than diplomatic niceties. It maintained strategic basing in Okinawa through negotiation, despite local resistance, because geography demanded it. It built Diego Garcia into a major military hub through negotiation and agreement rather than force. In each case, American security was strengthened without open conflict.\n\nGreenland deserves the same treatment now. Serious talks that reflect its importance. Offer fair payment to Denmark, respect local self-rule, and protect U.S. interests without turning the Arctic into an unnecessary flashpoint. Trump has his sights set on Greenland because the map leaves little room for alternatives.\n\nJohn Mac Ghlionn is a writer and researcher who explores culture, society and the impact of technology on daily life.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING (AP) — A week in which longtime tensions between neighbors China and Japan ratcheted up economically and politically drew to a close with no sign of improvements Friday as the Chinese ambassador in Tokyo rebuffed his host nation and the Japanese reported delayed shipments to suppliers in China because of the spat.\n\nThe two developments capped a week where China made clear its displeasure with Japan by instituting new export controls, condemning what it called Tokyo's renewed militarism and cozying up to another regional neighbor, South Korea, during its leader's visit to Beijing.\n\nOn Friday, the Chinese Communist Party's flagship newspaper, People's Daily, kept the jabs coming.\n\n“New militarism will lead Japan back into the abyss,” it said in an editorial. “History serves as a stark warning, yet the Japanese right wing is repeating its old tricks.”\n\nIt was the latest in several days of pointed Chinese criticism toward Japan after its prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, suggested in November that she wouldn't rule out intervening if China used military force against the island of Taiwan. China views self-governed Taiwan as its sovereign territory and has said it would take it by force if needed. It staged large-scale military exercises nearby late last month.\n\nChina keeps its export controls\n\nOn Thursday night, the Chinese embassy in Japan said it had rejected a petition from Japan's Foreign Ministry to retract the new export controls on “dual-use items” that the Japanese military might be able to use in weaponry. The ambassador, Wu Jianghao, insisted that China's move was “entirely legitimate, reasonable and lawful” — and vital to national security.\n\nAlso Friday, Japanese officials said they are closely watching if Japanese exports of agricultural, fisheries and other goods are appropriately handled by China without delays. The Japanese news agency Kyodo reported that outgoing shipments of sake and processed food from Japan to China were being held up because of the diplomatic tensions, widening the ripples of the dispute.\n\nOfficials at the government-affiliated Japan External Trade Organization told The Associated Press that the shipments had been delayed in customs on the China side starting in late November. Kyodo, quoting trade industry sources, said they believed sake may have been targeted as “a symbol of Japan.”\n\nJapan’s chief cabinet secretary, Minoru Kihara, said he was aware of reports that some of the Japanese exports to China have been held up. He wouldn’t comment on individual commercial transactions.\n\n“It is important that agricultural, fisheries and other exports from Japan are smoothly carried out,” Kihara said. “We will closely watch the situation and take appropriate measures.” He didn’t say what those might be.\n\nJapan and China have a fraught history haunted by the Japanese colonization of Taiwan in 1895. The nations have fought two wars, and the imperial government in Tokyo brutally occupied parts of China in the first half of the 20th century. The countries maintain diplomatic relations and work closely together on many fronts but occasionally use government apparatus to condemn each other when disputes arise.\n\nChina's choice of wording in the People's Daily editorial and other rhetoric was noteworthy. It avoided casting a broad brush on the Japanese people and specifically targeted the country's right wing, which Takaichi belongs to. A report Thursday about Japan's nuclear ambitions repeatedly mentioned the right wing, and the People's Daily editorial beseeched the “peace-loving Japanese people” to be “highly vigilant” toward their government.\n\n\"Japan’s future lies not in the dangerous fantasies painted by the right wing, but in the thorough reckoning with its history of aggression,\" People's Daily said.\n\nRare earths as a pressure point\n\nKihara, the government spokesman, said Chinese export controls of rare earths already in place have caused “serious impact on global supply chains.” “We believe that international trade of rare earths should be carried out smoothly,\" Kihara said.\n\nIndustry and Trade Minister Ryosei Akazawa did not confirm whether China’s dual-use goods ban included new action on rare earths. Azakawa said the impact on Japanese industries is already significant because about 70% of rare earths, used in a wide range of products such as electronic parts and autos, are imported from China.\n\n“Rare earths are extremely important minerals, and the export controls have already affected our country tremendously,” Akazawa said. He wouldn't comment on whether Japan would consider retaliating.\n\nChina also pointedly expressed positive feelings about South Korea during the visit this week of its president, Lee Jae Myung, who met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. After the signing of millions in new export contracts, Lee heralded “a new chapter in the development of Korea-China relations.\"\n\nAs he visited, Chinese state media — which recently warned that travel to Japan by Chinese citizens might be dangerous — provided splashy coverage and said outgoing Chinese traveler to South Korea during New Year's had surpassed those to Japan.\n\nRelations between Beijing and Tokyo showed at least one tiny positive sign Friday. At a Foreign Ministry briefing in Beijing, spokesperson Mao Ning was informed that a one-time Japanese ambassador to China had died. She expressed the country's condolences.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Jan 10 (Reuters) - China can narrow its technological gap with the U.S. driven by growing risk-taking and innovation, though the lack of advanced chipmaking tools is hobbling the ​sector, the country's leading artificial intelligence researchers said on Saturday.\n\nChina's so-called 'AI tiger' startups MiniMax and Zhipu ‌AI had strong debuts on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange this week, reflecting growing confidence in the sector as Beijing fast-tracks AI and ‌chip listings to bolster domestic alternatives to advanced U.S. technology.\n\nYao Shunyu, a former senior researcher at ChatGPT maker OpenAI who was named technology giant Tencent's chief AI scientist in December, said there was a high likelihood of a Chinese firm becoming the world's leading AI company in the next three to five years but said the lack of ⁠advanced chipmaking machines was the main ‌technical hurdle.\n\n\"Currently, we have a significant advantage in electricity and infrastructure. The main bottlenecks are production capacity, including lithography machines, and the software ecosystem,\" Yao said at an AI ‍conference in Beijing.\n\nChina has completed a working prototype of an extreme-ultraviolet lithography machine potentially capable of producing cutting-edge semiconductor chips that rival the West's, Reuters reported last month. However, the machine has not yet produced working chips and may not do ​so until 2030, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\nYao and other Chinese industry ‌leaders at the Beijing conference on Saturday also acknowledged that the U.S. maintains an advantage in computing power due to its hefty investments in infrastructure.\n\n\"The U.S. computer infrastructure is likely one to two orders of magnitude larger than ours. But I see that whether it's OpenAI or other platforms, they're investing heavily in next-generation research,\" said Lin Junyang, technical lead for Alibaba's flagship Qwen large language model.\n\n\"We, on the other hand, are relatively strapped for ⁠cash; delivery alone likely consumes the majority of our computer infrastructure,\" ​Lin said during a panel discussion at the AGI-Next Frontier Summit ​held by the Beijing Key Laboratory of Foundational Models at Tsinghua University.\n\nLin said China's limited resources have spurred its researchers to be innovative, particularly through algorithm-hardware co-design, which enables AI ‍firms to run large models ⁠on smaller, inexpensive hardware.\n\nTang Jie, founder of Zhipu AI which raised HK$4.35 billion in its IPO, also highlighted the willingness of younger Chinese AI entrepreneurs to embrace high-risk ventures - a trait traditionally associated ⁠with Silicon Valley - as a positive development.\n\n\"I think if we can improve this environment, allowing more time for these risk-taking, intelligent individuals ‌to engage in innovative endeavours ... this is something our government and the country can help improve,\" ‌said Tang.",

    "fullText": "(Corrects paragraph 4 to say Democratic Progressive Party, not Democratic People's Party)\n\nHONG KONG/TAIPEI, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Some Chinese online users are calling for a lightning Venezuela-style snatch of Taiwan's leaders in a prelude to taking over the island, but analysts, scholars and security officials say China's modernising military is still ​far from ready.\n\nIn Taiwan, they say, China's military has an adversary which has prepared for years against a \"decapitation operation\" on its leaders, besides extensive air defences and radar capabilities, ‌as well as likely support from the United States and its allies.\n\nAlthough China has spent years acquiring advanced weapons, questions remain about the capabilities of its People's Liberation Army in using them effectively, as well as a command structure that must knit ‌them together in combat.\n\n\"Once such an operation runs into trouble, it would quickly escalate into a full-scale conflict, with extremely high political and military risk,\" said Chen Kuan-ting, a lawmaker of Taiwan's ruling Democratic People's Party.\n\nTaiwan's layered air defence and early warning systems meant any air assault or special operations infiltration effort would risk detection as it crossed the Taiwan Strait, foreshadowing escalation, he added.\n\nThe United States showcased its forces' battle-tested air dominance with last weekend's operation to extract Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife.\n\nIts military controlled the skies with stealth fighters, jets that jammed enemy defences and covert reconnaissance drones and satellites feeding ⁠commanders real-time intelligence.\n\nChina's defence ministry offered no immediate response to faxed questions from Reuters.\n\nCHINA HAS NOT RULED OUT FORCE TO TAKE TAIWAN\n\nChina, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has not ruled out using force to bring the island under ‍its control. Taiwan rejects China's claims.\n\n\"Operationally, while the PLA is in recent times trying to get up to speed with force integration, it is still baby steps compared to what the Americans have for decades been accumulating,\" said Singapore-based security scholar Collin Koh.\n\nTaiwan is determined to defend its sovereignty and boost its defence, President Lai Ching-te said last month, after Beijing fired rockets towards Taiwan as part of its latest military drills.\n\nThe drills surrounding Taiwan - ​the most extensive to date - were accompanied by strong messaging from Chinese officials and the military.\n\n\"Any external forces that attempt to intervene in the Taiwan issue or interfere in China's internal ‌affairs will surely smash their heads bloody against the iron walls of the Chinese People's Liberation Army,\" China's Taiwan Affairs Office said in a statement.\n\nIn October, Lai unveiled a multi-layered air defence system called \"T-Dome\".\n\nIt is intended to be similar to Israel's \"Iron Dome\", with a more efficient and \"sensor-to-shooter\" mechanism for a higher kill rate that integrates weaponry from Taiwan-developed Sky Bow missiles to U.S.-supplied HIMARS rocket systems.\n\nIn July, Taiwan's military staged a drill to protect the Taipei's main airport from a hostile landing, deploying portable stinger rockets and tanks.\n\nMADURO EXTRACTION INSPIRES SOME\n\nWhile military attaches say China has war-gamed extraction operations in Taipei in a broad range of military options to take control of Taiwan, some Chinese online users tom-tommed the U.S. action in Venezuela as inspiration.\n\n\"The Venezuelan situation has provided us a solution for unifying ⁠Taiwan,\" said one user on the X-like microblogging site Weibo.\n\n\"First use special operations to arrest Lai Ching-te, then immediately ​announce the takeover of Taiwan, issue new identity cards ... and achieve a swift and decisive victory.\"\n\nChen, who sits on ​the foreign affairs and defence committee of Taiwan's parliament, dismissed such remarks as \"fantasy\" and other analysts said any such attempt would quickly face hard military realities.\n\nChina had added aircraft to replicate platforms such as Boeing's EA-18G Growler electronic warfare jet and Northrop Grumman's E-2D Advanced Hawkeye command and early warning aircraft, but their precise ‍capabilities had yet to be delineated, Koh said.\n\nWith the ⁠ruling Communist Party still playing a role in the PLA's command structure, doubts remain about its effectiveness, added Koh, who is with the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.\n\n\"A decentralised command-and-control hierarchy is essential; that allows field commanders to exercise necessary initiative to cope with the fluid, evolving and uncertain nature of military operations as events unfold,\" Koh said.\n\nDespite any ⁠perceived PLA shortcomings, Taiwan's leaders are taking no chances, however.\n\n\"We have have no capital to take them lightly,\" said a senior Taiwan security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the military issues are sensitive.\n\n\"After all, in the wake ‌of this painful and shocking experience, China will also look for all kinds of ways to overcome these problems.\"",

    "description": "Meta's Manus deal faces a probe from China's regulator. Analysts say it's about sending a message that China's AI talent isn't easy pickings.",
    "fullText": "China has a message for US tech firms: Hands off our AI talent and tech.\n\nThat's what Beijing is signalling by announcing a probe into Meta's acquisition of Manus, analysts told Business Insider.\n\nThe probe, confirmed by China's Ministry of Commerce in a Thursday press conference, will investigate whether the acquisition complies with the country's laws and regulations concerning export controls, according to a statement translated by Google.\n\nManus was launched in China last March by the AI product studio Butterfly Effect and drew global attention after saying it had designed a \"general-purpose\" AI agent that can conduct tasks with limited human supervision. In mid-2025, the startup relocated to Singapore.\n\nIn December, Meta announced that it would acquire Manus and sever its ties with China completely. The deal reportedly exceeds $2 billion. Meta did not respond to a request for comment for this story from Business Insider.\n\nWhile China and the US have long engaged in tit-for-tat regulatory exchanges involving their tech companies, analysts told Business Insider this probe is notable because it appears to be aimed at discouraging so-called \"Singapore washing\" — the process of moving a company from China to Singapore to reduce regulatory scrutiny.\n\nTikTok's parent company, ByteDance, and fast-fashion giant Shein are among those that have shifted their headquarters from China to Singapore.\n\nThe probe is also a means to discourage Chinese AI startups from choosing the US, analysts said.\n\n\"I see Beijing's probe as an effort to prevent the loss of AI technology and talent to foreign acquisition, especially to the US,\" Wendy Chang, a senior analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, told Business Insider.\n\nMeta said it plans to bring over Manus' top leadership and will continue to run its AI agent platform separately, alongside integrating the technology into Meta's own products.\n\nNvidia, the world's most valuable company, has been the subject of US export controls for years, which limit the sale of its advanced chips to China. The Manus probe shows how the battleground has moved from beyond chips to \"models, agents, talent, and enterprise deployment,\" Murthy Grandhi, a company profiles analyst at research firm GlobalData, told Business Insider.\n\nHanna Dohmen, senior research analyst at Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, told Business Insider that while the probe \"isn't entirely surprising,\" the approach regulators are taking is \"more novel\" because it \"appears to focus on the movement of talent and IP.\"\n\nTalent has become a focal point of the AI race, with companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google offering huge pay packages to entice the best and brightest. Last year, Meta invested $14 billion in AI training startup Scale AI, bringing its CEO, Alexandr Wang, over to run the tech giant's AI efforts.\n\nChina's Manus probe could signal that it was policing \"outbound AI technology transfer with greater rigor,\" said Grandhi, adding that it could accelerate the \"bifurcation of AI ecosystems.\"\n\nThe US and China have been taking diverging approaches to AI, with Chinese companies tending to favor AI models that are more open, such as DeepSeek.\n\nIt's not clear how long China's probe will last, should it progress into a full investigation. Other investigations from China's Ministry have taken more than a year.\n\nGrandhi said that in his view, the most likely outcome is that the deal will be approved \"with constraints, rather than an outright block.\"\n\n\"Whatever the outcome may be, this certainly sends a signal to other US or foreign companies that are considering similar acquisitions,\" added Dohmen.",

    "fullText": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said it's \"naive\" to think the US will shift away from China.\n\n\"The idea of decoupling for whatever reason, philosophical reasons or national security reasons, it's not based on any common sense,\" Huang said during an episode of the \"No Priors\" podcast posted on Thursday.\n\nHuang, whose company is eagerly awaiting the ability to sell advanced chips in China again, praised President Donald Trump's approach to navigating the relationship between the world's two largest economies.\n\n\"I am optimistic that our relationship with China will improve, that President Trump and the administration has a really, really grounded and common-sense attitude and philosophy around how to think about China, that they're an adversary, but they're also a partner in many ways, and that the idea of decoupling is naive.\"\n\nNvidia may soon be returning to the lucrative Chinese market, which Huang once estimated could be worth $50 billion a year.\n\nBloomberg reported on Thursday that China planned to approve some sales of Nvidia's H200 chips \"as soon as this quarter.\" In December, Trump lifted a Biden-era policy that effectively banned Nvidia from selling its older H200 in China, provided the US government gets a 25% cut on future sales. Huang has repeatedly said that the US will not slow down China's AI advancements by curtailing the sales of advanced chips.\n\nHuang said on Tuesday that he was not expecting a formal announcement from Beijing approving the sales of H200 chips. China previously imposed its restrictions on such sales.\n\n\"We're not expecting any press releases, or any large declarations,\" Huang said during a news conference on the sidelines of CES in Las Vegas. \"It's just going to be purchase orders.\"\n\nAs for the broader US-China relationship, Huang said that both nations ought to continue to invest in their own independence. Trump has deployed a combination of tariffs and incentives to encourage US-based companies to bring their manufacturing back to the US.\n\n\"When you depend too much on someone, the relationship becomes too emotional, as you know,\" Huang said. \"And so it's good to have some independence or there as much independence as either would like, but to recognize that there's a lot of coupling, a lot of dependence between the two countries. And I think there needs to be a nuanced strategy, a nuanced attitude about how to manage this relationship in a productive way for all of the people of two countries and for all of the people around the world.\"\n\nThe world needs both sides to figure it out, Huang said.\n\n\"Everybody depends on a productive, constructive relationship of the two most important nations and the single most important relationship for the next century,\" he said. \"And so we have to find that answer.\"",

    "description": "When it comes to claiming that Venezuelan oil is now under his control, President Donald Trump is mincing no words.  After all, Trump is expected to visit Beijing in April as part of an effort to protect the fragile trade truce he reached with Chinese President Xi Jinping late last year.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — When it comes to claiming that Venezuelan oil is now under his control, President Donald Trump is mincing no words. But no small part of that oil belongs to China under contracts it struck with Caracas years ago, setting the stage for a delicate diplomatic dance in the next few weeks.\n\nSome experts expect Trump to work with China in an effort to stabilize trade relations. After all, Trump is expected to visit Beijing in April as part of an effort to protect the fragile trade truce he reached with Chinese President Xi Jinping late last year.\n\n“The administration appears focused on avoiding unnecessary escalation or new irritants with Beijing while keeping leverage firmly on Washington’s terms,” said Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nHe added that he doubted Trump would risk turning Venezuela into a “flashpoint that complicates trade dynamics or Trump’s personal engagement with Xi.”\n\nChina is owed at least $10 billion from Venezuela, according to various estimates, a debt that former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro had paid down by shipping oil to China. It is possible that the interim Venezuelan government complying with Washington’s demands could question the legality of those loans-for-oil deals and cease payments.\n\nTwo major Chinese state-owned enterprises — China National Petroleum Corp. and Sinopec — are entitled to 4.4 billion barrels of oil reserves in Venezuela, the highest for any foreign country, according to a research note by the investment bank Morgan Stanley.\n\nU.S. companies also have claims for tens of billions of dollars from when Caracas nationalized the oil industry, and it’s not clear how these IOUs will be honored and in what order.\n\nThe U.S. seized two sanctioned oil tankers this week as part of a plan to assert control over Venezuelan oil shipments. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the U.S. will handle the sales of Venezuela’s oil “indefinitely,” depositing proceeds into U.S.-controlled accounts that will ultimately “flow back into Venezuela to benefit the Venezuelan people.”\n\nThe administration said this week that the U.S. would kickstart those sales with 30 million to 50 million barrels taken from the South American country’s crude storage facilities. Asked for more detail, a Trump administration official not authorized to comment publicly and speaking on condition of anonymity said U.S. policy was to wind down “adversarial outside influence” in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe U.S. using such leverage over a crucial natural resource comes after Beijing flexed its muscles last year by choking off critical supplies of rare-earth magnets and weaponizing its purchase of American soybeans in the trade war with Washington. When Trump met Xi in South Korea in October, the two men agreed to a one-year truce, backing off from sky-high tariffs and export controls on each other.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2023, Venezuela was the fourth-largest recipient of Beijing's official credit, having received $106 billion worth of loans from China’s official-sector creditors, according to AidData, a research lab at Virginia's College of William & Mary that tracks Beijing's overseas lending activities. But how much of the total that Caracas has paid off and what is still owed is unclear, said AidData executive director Brad Parks, because Caracas stopped reporting debt details several years ago.\n\nWhile some estimates put the outstanding debt at $10 billion, Parks said the figure could be much higher because U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan oil might have delayed loan repayments. The loans from China, under an unusual arrangement, were set up to be paid down with proceeds from oil exports.\n\nIn China, the capture of Maduro evoked memories of another leader who had struck deals with Chinese companies and then suddenly lost power: Libya's Moammar Gadhafi.\n\nAfter the 2011 fall of Gadhafi, Chinese businesses had to leave behind billions in investments. Cui Shoujun, professor of international studies at Renmin University in Beijing, told the Chinese news and commentary site guancha.cn that the transition government in Caracas could deem agreements under Maduro unlawful and the debt to China illegal.\n\nAs in Libya, Beijing’s stakes in Venezuela have gone beyond oil. Chinese firms have invested in telecommunications, railways and ports in Venezuela, all now at risk, according to a report by the global financial firm Jefferies.\n\nStill, the firm noted that Beijing will likely manage any disruption because Venezuelan oil counted for only a small percentage of China's oil imports and because Beijing has diversified its energy supplies and pivoted to electrification.\n\nHours before he was captured by U.S. forces, Maduro hosted a high-level Chinese diplomat at the presidential palace and praised the countries' ties that had prospered from the days of his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, and given Beijing a strong foothold in America's backyard.\n\nVenezuela is the only Latin American country that has a high-level strategic partnership with China, on par with close friends like Pakistan, and the ouster of Maduro is expected to curtail China's influence in the Western Hemisphere — in line with one of the goals spelled out in the Trump administration's National Security Strategy.\n\nBeijing's response to the capture of Maduro\n\nSoon after Maduro was captured, Beijing said it was “deeply shocked” by the blatant use of U.S. force against a sovereign state and action against its president and said it “strongly” condemned the U.S. actions. It called for the immediate release of Maduro and his wife.\n\nChinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong said Thursday that no nation has the right to interfere with economic and trade cooperation between China and Venezuela, which he said is between two sovereign states and protected by international and domestic laws.\n\n“No matter how the political situation in Venezuela evolves, China’s willingness to deepen bilateral economic and trade cooperation will not change,” He said.\n\nSingleton said Beijing does not wield the clout in the Western Hemisphere as touted.\n\n“Beijing can protest diplomatically,” he said, “but it cannot protect partners or assets once Washington decides to apply direct pressure.”",

Xi invited Carney to China when they met during an Asia-Pacific summit in October. The visit comes as the two countries move to restore stronger ties after years of tensions.\n\n“We’re forging new partnerships around the world to transform our economy from one that has been reliant on a single trade partner, to one that is stronger and more resilient to global shock,” Carney said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nCarney will travel to China from Jan. 13 to 17. He will also attend the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland from Jan. 19 to 21.\n\nTrump has been threatening Canada’s economy and sovereignty with tariffs, most offensively by claiming Canada could be “the 51st state.”\n\nThe attempt at rapprochement with China comes as Carney looks to double Canada’s non-U.S. exports in the next decade and as the free trade agreement with the U.S. and Mexico is up for review this year. More than 75% percent of Canada’s exports go to the U.S.\n\nChina is Canada's second largest trading partner.\n\nRelations between China and Canada took a nosedive in late 2018 after Canadian authorities arrested a senior executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei as a part of its extradition agreement with the United States. China then arrested two Canadian citizens in retaliation.\n\nMore recently, relations have been shaken by Canada’s decision to levy a 100% tariff on electric vehicles, batteries and other goods from China in 2024. Canada made the move in tandem with the U.S.\n\nCanadian canola producers, seafood exporters and pork farmers are dealing with steep Chinese tariffs in retaliation.\n\nChina has offered to remove its import taxes on some Canadian products if Canada drops the EV tariff.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING (AP) — China escalated its trade tensions with Japan on Wednesday by launching an investigation into imported dichlorosilane, a chemical gas used in making semiconductors, a day after it imposed curbs on the export of so-called dual-use goods that could be used by Japan’s military.\n\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement that it had launched the investigation following an application from the domestic industry showing the price of dichlorosilane imported from Japan had decreased 31% between 2022 and 2024.\n\n“The dumping of imported products from Japan has damaged the production and operation of our domestic industry,” the ministry said.\n\nThe measure comes a day after Beijing banned exports to Japan of dual-use goods that can have military applications.\n\nBeijing has been showing mounting displeasure with Tokyo after new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested late last year that her nation's military could intervene if China were to take action against Taiwan — an island democracy that Beijing considers its own territory.\n\nTensions were stoked again on Tuesday when Japanese lawmaker Hei Seki, who last year was sanctioned by China for “spreading fallacies” about Taiwan and other disputed territories, visited Taiwan and called it an independent country. Also known as Yo Kitano, he has been banned from entering China. He told reporters that his arrival in Taiwan demonstrated the two are “different countries.”\n\n“I came to Taiwan … to prove this point, and to tell the world that Taiwan is an independent country,” Hei Seki said, according to Taiwan’s Central News Agency.\n\n“The nasty words of a petty villain like him are not worth commenting on,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning retorted when asked about his comment.\n\nMasaaki Kanai, head of Asia Oceanian Affairs at Japan's Foreign Ministry, urged China to scrap the trade curbs, saying a measure exclusively targeting Japan that deviates from international practice is unacceptable. Japan, however, has yet to announce any retaliatory measures.\n\nAs the two countries feuded, speculation rose that China might target rare earths exports to Japan, in a move similar to the rounds of critical minerals export restrictions it has imposed as part of its trade war with the United States.\n\nChina controls most of the global production of heavy rare earths, used for making powerful, heat-resistant magnets used in industries such as defense and electric vehicles.\n\nWhile the Commerce Ministry did not mention any new rare earths curbs, the official newspaper China Daily, seen as a government mouthpiece, quoted anonymous sources saying Beijing was considering tightening exports of certain rare earths to Japan. That report could not be independently confirmed.\n\nImproved South Korean ties contrast with Japan row\n\nAs Beijing spars with Tokyo, it has made a point of courting a different East Asian power — South Korea.\n\nOn Wednesday, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung wrapped up a four-day trip to China – his first since taking office in June. Lee and Chinese President Xi Jinping oversaw the signing of cooperation agreements in areas such as technology, trade, transportation and environmental protection.\n\nAs if to illustrate a contrast with the China-Japan trade frictions, Lee joined two business events at which major South Korean and Chinese companies pledged to collaborate.\n\nThe two sides signed 24 export contracts worth a combined $44 million, according to South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Resources.\n\nDuring Lee’s visit, Chinese media also reported that South Korea overtook Japan as the leading destination for outbound flights from China’s mainland over the New Year’s holiday.\n\nChina has been discouraging travel to Japan, saying Japanese leaders’ comments on Taiwan have created “significant risks to the personal safety and lives of Chinese citizens in Japan.”",

It called the move \"absolutely unacceptable and deeply regrettable\" and said the measures targeted only Japan and that they \"deviate significantly from international practice.\"Johnson said Japan is unlikely to respond immediately but could retaliate if restrictions intensify, adding that other countries could potentially follow suit.",
