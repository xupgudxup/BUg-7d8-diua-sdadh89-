    "fullText": "SHANGHAI - Japanese-themed manga and anime have been barred from one of China's largest comic conventions about a week before the show begins in late December, Hong Kong media reported, amid a continuing diplomatic row between Tokyo and Beijing.\n\nThe decision was notified to participants last Friday ahead of the two-day Comicup convention scheduled to be held next weekend in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou near Shanghai, according to the South China Morning Post.\n\nExhibitors and visitors were informed by the event's organizers that there would be a \"full-scale adjustment\" of content toward \"a new Chinese style\" theme across the venue due to the \"current social environment and our cultural obligations,\" the Hong Kong newspaper said Tuesday.\n\nThe exhibition areas themed around American and European content did not seem to be affected at the event featuring some 7,000 booths, which has become a massive marketplace for creators of derivative works based on various anime, comics, and game fan groups, according to the report.\n\nWhile the notification did not name Japan, several dozen exhibitors featuring Japanese anime and other themed content said on social media that their booths had been cancelled for reasons \"well-known to all\" and \"factors beyond control,\" the SCMP said.\n\nA similar comic convention held in Shanghai in October drew hundreds of thousands of visitors. The paper quoted a woman whose booth was supposed to have featured artwork of the Japanese manga \"Let's Go Karaoke!\" as saying, \"I am feeling utterly helpless and sad.\"\n\nThe ongoing dispute between the two Asian neighbors stems from Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's parliamentary remarks last month that suggested an attack on Taiwan could constitute a \"survival-threatening situation\" for Japan, prompting possible involvement of the Self-Defense Forces.\n\nBeijing has since ramped up its retaliatory measures, including urging its citizens not to visit Japan, suspending seafood imports from the neighboring country and canceling cultural events featuring Japanese artists.\n\nMeanwhile, manga and animation events scheduled for January in such Chinese cities as Shenzhen in Guangdong Province and Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province were postponed due to \"force majeure,\" according to organizers.",

    "description": "China is already producing a wide range of EVs, including several options that cost less than $25,000.",
    "fullText": "In 2025, 1 in 4 new automotive vehicle sales globally are expected to be an electric vehicle – either fully electric or a plug-in hybrid.\n\nThat is a significant rise from just five years ago, when EV sales amounted to fewer than 1 in 20 new car sales, according to the International Energy Agency, an intergovernmental organization examining energy use around the world.\n\nIn the U.S., however, EV sales have lagged, only reaching 1 in 10 in 2024. By contrast, in China, the world’s largest car market, more than half of all new vehicle sales are electric.\n\nThe International Energy Agency has reported that two-thirds of fully electric cars in China are now cheaper to buy than their gasoline equivalents. With operating and maintenance costs already cheaper than gasoline models, EVs are attractive purchases.\n\nMost EVs purchased in China are made there as well, by a range of different companies. NIO, Xpeng, Xiaomi, Zeekr, Geely, Chery, Great Wall Motor, Leapmotor and especially BYD are household names in China. As someone who has followed and published on the topic of EVs for over 15 years, I expect they will soon become as widely known in the rest of the world.\n\nChina’s automakers are producing a full range of electric vehicles, from the subcompact, like the BYD Seagull, to full-size SUVs, like the Xpeng G9, and luxury cars, like the Zeekr 009.\n\nRecent European crash-test evaluations have given top safety ratings to Chinese EVs, and many of them cost less than similar models made by other companies in other countries.\n\nThere are several factors behind Chinese companies’ success in producing and selling EVs. To be sure, relatively low labor costs are part of the explanation. So are generous government subsidies, as EVs were one of several advanced technologies selected by the Chinese government to propel the nation’s global technological profile.\n\nBut Chinese EV makers are also making other advances. They make significant use of industrial robotics, even to the point of building so-called “dark factories” that can operate with minimal human intervention. For passengers, they have reimagined vehicles’ interiors, with large touchscreens for information and entertainment, and even added a refrigerator, bed or karaoke system.\n\nCompetition among Chinese EV makers is fierce, which drives additional innovation. BYD is the largest seller of EVs, both domestically and globally. Yet the company says it employs over 100,000 scientists and engineers seeking continual improvement.",

    "title": "Taiwan needs to flood the battlefield with cheap, mobile, and survivable weapons to counter China, former senior military officer says",
    "description": "In a war with China, Taiwan could have an asymmetric advantage with a high volume of cheap and survivable weapons, a retired admiral said.",
    "fullText": "To prepare for a possible all-out war with China, Taiwan should focus on fielding substantial numbers of cheap, mobile, and survivable weapons, a former top Taiwanese defense official said.\n\nTaiwan currently faces two types of conflict — what experts and officials have referred to as China's gray-zone activities that are just below the threshold of war and the potential for a full-scale Chinese invasion. Countering both requires an array of weaponry.\n\nAt a Hudson Institute think tank event earlier this month, retired admiral and former chief of the general staff for Taiwan's defense ministry Lee Hsi-Min said Taiwan needed to prioritize the existential threat of a Chinese invasion. Gray-zone actions, such as frequent aircraft incursions, strain resources and stress assets and troops. The other could be catastrophic, as war games have shown.\n\n\"We need a large number of the distributed, mobile, survivable, lethal\" weapons, Lee argued, and those systems need to be low-cost, high-volume, and highly survivable in a fight, he added.\n\nAsymmetric warfare is a strategy that uses large numbers of inexpensive, mobile, hard-to-target systems — like drones, missiles, and dispersed units — to blunt a larger military's advantages by denying it easy targets and inflicting outsized damage. Think drones blowing up tanks in Ukraine or sinking Russian warships.\n\nLee argues that Taiwan's survival in a war against China depends on exactly this kind of strategy.\n\nTaiwan has aggressively pursued a strategy focused on weapons that fit these bills, including various types of drones, sensors, jamming, and anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles. Broader elements of increased investments in asymmetric warfare plans include how the civilian population of Taiwan is trained for a potential Chinese invasion and how the Taiwanese military would use urban warfare to hold off Chinese forces.\n\nThis doesn't mean conventional platforms and high-end weapons aren't valuable, Lee said, especially for helping Taiwan deter the everyday activities the Chinese military engages in, such as aggressive actions in the air and sea and massive exercises regularly held nearby. However, \"we need scalable\" and \"smart enough\" weapons, he said.\n\n\"If we are conducting the protracted war, sometimes the quantity means quality,\" Lee said. \"If we only have a kind of a small number of the advanced, sophisticated platform, I think we will have a big problem if China decided to attack Taiwan.\"\n\nSimilar lessons are being learned from the war in Ukraine. Soldiers, veterans, and drone makers have all said that a limited arsenal of exquisite systems isn't the right fit for a long war. The need is large volumes of cheap weapons. In warfare, sustainability is key. Overengineering and overspending simply aren't sustainable in a high-end fight.\n\nLee previously argued for asymmetric warfare and more mobile, uncrewed weapons and systems rather than buying more conventional weaponry like fighter jets and tanks in his \"Overall Defense Concept.\"\n\nIn 2020, he wrote in an article for The Diplomat that the idea is based on the premise that China will continue to see claiming Taiwan as a national and existential priority and Beijing will keep pouring money and resources into its military, which is vastly out-scaling Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan's government budgets for defense have increased substantially in recent years, and it continues to buy missiles, air defense systems, and drones from the US and other allies and partners.\n\nBut given the significant disparity between China and Taiwan's militaries and capabilities, \"Taiwan must abandon notions of a traditional war of attrition with the PLA [People’s Liberation Army],\" Lee and co-author Eric Lee, then a researcher at the Project 2049 Institute, wrote.\n\nTaiwan faces a substantially stronger adversary, and thus \"embracing an effective asymmetric defense posture and incorporating tactical asymmetric capabilities could compensate for Taiwan's disadvantage on paper and prevent the PLA from getting boots on the ground,\" they argued.\n\nAt the moment, Taiwan is leaning on a mix of capabilities. This month, the US announced its largest-ever weapons sale to Taiwan, at $11 billion. It includes High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, Army Tactical Missile Systems, Javelin missiles, howitzers, and drones.\n\nTaiwan's defense ministry said the weapons help bolster its self-defense and deterrence capabilities. China's foreign ministry said the sale violated agreements between Beijing and Washington and risked military confrontation with Taiwan.\n\nAn important piece of Taiwan's asymmetric strategy is rapid investment in domestic drone production, informed by lessons from Ukraine and collaborations with US and European firms. Taipei aims to produce 200,000 drones annually by 2030 and is investing billions into other defense systems, including a new air-defense network known as T-Dome.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — China will impose up to 42.7% of provisional tariffs on dairy products including milk and cheese imported from the European Union, its Commerce Ministry said Monday.\n\nThe elevated duties, which take effect Tuesday, were based on preliminary results from an investigation opened by China’s Commerce Ministry in August 2024 as tensions between Beijing and Brussels flared. Beijing reviewed subsidies provided by EU countries for their dairy and other farm products.\n\nBeijing’s probe was launched as part of tit-for-tat measures as the EU investigated Chinese subsidies on electric vehicles, and later imposed tariffs as high as 45.3% on China-made EVs.\n\nChina had initiated other probes into European brandy and pork imports as counter measures for the EU’s tariffs on Chinese EVs. It had also urged the EU to scrap its EV tariffs.\n\nThe temporary duties on EU dairy imports will range from 21.9% to 42.7%, according to the Commerce Ministry, and will cover a basket of dairy products, including fresh and processed cheese, blue cheese, milk, and cream with a fat content exceeding 10% by weight.\n\nThe ministry said preliminary findings from its investigation determined that subsidies provided by the EU and EU member states for their dairy products had damaged China’s dairy industry.\n\nThe European Commission, which manages trade talks and issues on behalf of the 27 EU member countries, expressed concern over the tariffs.\n\n“The commission’s assessment is that the investigation is based on questionable allegations and insufficient evidence, and that the measures are therefore unjustified and unwarranted,” spokesperson Olof Gill said.\n\nGill told reporters that the commission is examining the reasoning behind the move and intends to provide comments to the Chinese authorities.\n\nBeijing’s probe into EU dairy products covered subsidies given under the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy and subsidies offered to farmers by EU countries including Italy, Ireland and Finland, the Commerce Ministry said in August 2024.\n\nChina’s relationship with the EU is fractious, with the Chinese trade surplus with the EU recently coming into the spotlight. The EU runs a significant trade deficit with China, at more than 300 billion euros ($352 billion) last year.\n\nLast week, Beijing announced it was imposing up to 19.8% tariffs on EU pork imports — significantly lower than preliminary tariffs of up to 62.4%.\n\nIt accused the EU of dumping pork and pig by-products in the country, selling them at cheap prices which in turn harmed its domestic pork industry.\n\nIn July, Beijing also announced up to 34.9% tariffs on brandy imported from the EU — including cognac from France — although several major brandy brands had received exemptions.\n\nGill said the EU remains committed to good trade and investment ties with China.\n\n“But in order for that to meaningfully happen, there is a list of issues and concerns that the European Union has had going back many months and even years that we would require China to address, in terms of overcapacity, in terms of unfair use of trade instruments, in terms of trade deficit, and so on,” he said.",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame said the US needs to shift away from \"power-hungry\" chips, but Nvidia has a \"death grip\" on the sector.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry says Nvidia is pushing the idea that building graphics chips that consume more and more power is the best path to advancing AI — and the result could be the US losing the AI race to China.\n\n\"Exactly and sadly,\" Burry wrote on X late Saturday, responding to another user's comment that called Nvidia the \"gangster of the AI neighborhood\" as it has \"shut down any narrative that even hints at reducing GPU demand.\"\n\nIn another post over the weekend, Burry shared a chart showing China has more than double America's electric generation capacity, and is expanding its energy infrastructure at a much faster rate.\n\nWhy China will win AI in one chart. \n\nPower hungry Nvidia chips are not the way forward for the U.S. \n\nIt is not just the total power advantage. It is the slope. pic.twitter.com/qNXh1e4lZj\n\nNvidia has framed AI innovation as \"just figuring out how to power and to cool bigger, hotter silicon,\" Burry said. But China's huge lead in building out power sources means companies in the US are \"plowing capital into a race it is structurally positioned to lose.\"\n\nBurry said the US needs to shift its focus from developing more and more \"power hungry\" chips toward advancing \"AI-tuned ASICs\" — application-specific integrated circuits that are designed to do a particular task quickly and efficiently.\n\nBut he said Nvidia has a \"death grip on development\" thanks to its deals with many key players in the AI industry.\n\nNvidia did not immediately reply to a request for comment from Business Insider about Burry's posts.\n\nNvidia stock has surged more than 12-fold since the start of 2023, making it the world's most valuable public company, with a market capitalization of $4.4 trillion.\n\nThe chipmaker raked in about $148 billion of revenue and $77 billion of net income in the first nine months of this year. \"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in the third-quarter earnings release.\n\nBurry, whose contrarian bet against the US housing bubble was chronicled in the book and movie \"The Big Short,\" recently pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack.\n\nHe has made the case to his readers that Nvidia and other AI companies are inflating a historic tech bubble. He has said that Nvidia's customers have exaggerated the lifespan of its chips to drag out depreciation and boost short-term earnings.\n\nBurry has also called out the \"give-and-take\" deals between Nvidia and chip buyers such as OpenAI and Oracle, and criticized Nvidia's stock-based compensation as excessive.\n\nNvidia previously responded to his critiques in a memo to Wall Street analysts that was quickly leaked. Burry fired back that the document featured \"one straw man after another\" and he stood by his analysis.\n\nReplying to a subsequent comment on his Substack, Burry wrote that Nvidia had \"become too much of a focus.\" While the company's response did make him \"think to look a little deeper,\" he said it was a \"relatively small short\" for him.\n\n\"I believe it will fall, and is a pure play on my overall thesis, but it is not the worst out there.\"",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Dec 22 (Reuters) - A revamp of China's electricity market is boosting the economics of storing power just as international demand surges, sparking a boom for the Chinese energy storage manufacturers that already dominate globally.\n\nChinese firms are on track for a 75% jump this year in global shipments of lithium-ion battery cells for energy storage, ​according to one estimate.\n\nThey have exported more than $65 billion worth of storage and electric-vehicle batteries this year, cementing their dominance in a sector vital to backing up wind and solar ‌and keeping power coursing through artificial-intelligence data centres.\n\nThe surge in sales is driven by data centres and renewables domestically, as well as by Chinese reforms and subsidies that are boosting general demand for energy storage. International demand is rising in tandem with the ‌surging growth in data centres, a need to back up Europe's ageing grid and China's burgeoning renewable energy business in the Middle East, analysts say.\n\n\"These leading energy storage cell makers, they have full orders. Many of them are basically working double shifts now to try and meet demand,\" said analyst Cosimo Ries at policy research firm Trivium China. The boom \"is one of the biggest surprises of the year, I think, in China's energy space.\"\n\nUBS last month raised its 2026 forecast for global battery-energy storage installations by 25%.\n\nThe International Energy Agency forecasts global investment in battery storage facilities will rise 16% this year to $66 billion. Much of that is ⁠set to be captured by Chinese firms because while Tesla is number ‌one in energy storage systems, China dominates production of the tiny cells inside them.\n\nAll of the six top global cell suppliers - Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL), HiTHIUM, EVE Energy, BYD, CALB and REPT BATTERO - are Chinese, according to a January-to-September ranking by consultancy Infolink. Of the top 10, only Japan's AESC is not from China.\n\nEVE's ‍energy storage sales volumes rose 35.51% in the first three quarters from the same period last year. REPT BATTERO's third-quarter shipments of all batteries set a record high. Top EV players CATL and BYD did not break out energy storage shipments through the third quarter. Storage has historically made up less of their revenue than automotive batteries and EVs, although the proportion is growing.\n\n\"Pairing solar with storage has effectively become the only solution for meeting U.S. AI ​data-centre power needs,\" UBS analyst Yishu Yan told a media briefing. \"U.S. AI data centre power demand is very robust, but power is the biggest bottleneck, and U.S. baseload power - gas, nuclear, thermal - they ‌won't grow much in the next five years.\"",

    "description": "As iRobot's founder Colin Angle looks back on its path to bankruptcy, he says it was hard to overcome competitors in China.",
    "fullText": "If there's one lesson iRobot founder Colin Angle took from the company's bankruptcy, it's never to underestimate competitors.\n\nOn December 14, iRobot, maker of the popular robotic vacuum Roomba, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and will be acquired by its primary contract manufacturer, Chinese company Picea Robotics.\n\nAngle said one of his biggest takeaways as iRobot enters its next phase is that even market leaders must remain alert to competition from China.\n\n\"It's certainly the advent of this new type of competitor, the Chinese fast follower, who had access to the Chinese marketplace, which iRobot effectively did not,\" he said on the tech podcast \"Hard Fork\" on Friday.\n\niRobot was founded in 1990 by Angle, Helen Greiner, and Rodney Brooks — roboticists at MIT — who had a \"vision of making practical robots a reality,\" the company says on its website. It released its popular robot vacuum, Roomba, in 2002, which effectively created the category of consumer robotics.\n\nFor the next two decades, Angle said that the company grew the category and, for a brief period, was the leading manufacturer of vacuuming robots in China. The company reached its peak revenue in 2021, at $1.56 billion.\n\nIn the years that followed, however, Angle said the home robotics market was upended by new entrants from China, such as Roborock, which had been chipping away at iRobot's dominance since its arrival in 2018. Other Chinese competitors include Dreame, Ecovacs, and Shar.\n\nAngle said that companies like Roborock had an advantage against iRobot because they had a \"protected market to cut your teeth on for the competition.\"\n\nChina made several moves to ensure that Chinese manufacturers in the category had an advantage by providing direct subsidies to iRobot's competitors, Angle said.\n\nOver the past few years, China has made significant strides toward becoming a global hub for robotics innovation and adoption, rolling out multiple strategic plans across several sectors. As part of those efforts, the government has subsidized robot purchases at an average rate of about 17.5% of equipment costs, according to the Asian Robotics Review.\n\nIn some cases, iRobot's features simply lagged behind its competitors.\n\n\"Honestly, we got wet mopping wrong,\" he said. Scuba, iRobot's mopping robot, never took off as an independent product.\n\n\"It certainly got hard, and it got increasingly competitive,\" Angle said. \"Ultimately, we were open to other strategies to enable us to continue to innovate.\"\n\nOne of those was striking a deal with Amazon, which attempted to acquire the company for $1.4 billion, but the deal was terminated following an antitrust review by the Federal Trade Commission and European regulators.\n\n\"The Commission's probe focused on Amazon's ability and incentive to favor its own products and disfavor rivals, and associated effects on innovation, entry barriers, and consumer privacy,\" the FTC said in a statement in 2024. \"The Commission's investigation revealed significant concerns about the transaction's potential competitive effects.\"\n\nAngle said the deal should have been a \"no-brainer\" in a recent interview with TechCrunch.\n\n\"What happened was that iRobot and Amazon came together for the expressed purpose of creating more innovation, more consumer choice, at a time when iRobot's trajectory was honestly different from where it was several years earlier,\" he told TechCrunch.\n\nHe said the FTC and the European Commission's investigation should not have gone longer than three or four weeks.\n\n\"What happened instead was a year and a half of pendency, which had a very challenging impact on the ability to operate a company and ultimately having the acquisition blocked,\" he said.\n\nHe said iRobot should serve as a cautionary tale for the future of US manufacturing.\n\n\"The net result, which, I have argued, was done with eyes wide open, was putting the consumer robot industry in a box, gift-wrapping it, and handing it to someone else,\" he told \"Hard Fork.\"",

    "fullText": "Nike's grip on China's sneaker market is slipping.\n\nOnce a status symbol among Chinese consumers, analysts say it's increasingly losing cultural relevance even as its products remain innovative.\n\nThe sportswear giant's stock tumbled by 9% in early trading on Friday after reporting its Q2 fiscal results on Thursday.\n\nWhile sales in North America rose 9% to $5.63 billion during the quarter, sales in Greater China were down 17% to $1.42 billion — falling short of Wall Street's expectations.\n\nNike CEO Elliott Hill said on Thursday's earnings call, \"It's clear that we need to reset our approach to the China marketplace.\"\n\n\"We're acting decisively to accelerate the lagging areas, with China at the top of that list,\" he said.\n\nWhile retail watchers say Nike has made some progress in preparing for this reset by reducing promotions and improving inventory management, there's a deeper challenge at play.\n\nThe \"brand that is not connecting culturally in a way that rivals are,\" Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, warned in a note to clients on Thursday.\n\nSaunders said this is a \"more entrenched problem\" that is going to take some time to resolve.\n\nThe core problem is a \"systemic cultural lag,\" Linda Yu, general manager of consultancy firm Red Ant Asia, told Business Insider.\n\nNike \"needs to move beyond traditional sports marketing and genuinely understand and integrate into the cultural confidence, sense of community belonging, and lifestyle aspirations of China's younger generation,\" she added.\n\nChinese consumers, particularly Gen Z, are embracing the \"Guochao\" movement that celebrates Chinese heritage and homegrown brands.\n\nLocal brands such as Anta and Li-Ning have been capitalizing on this by creating culturally relevant campaigns, product designs, and digital experiences that resonate with younger consumers.\n\nNike's messaging, which still leans heavily on \"elite athleticism and individual grit\" — with slogans like its iconic \"Just Do It\" — feels distant by comparison, Jack Porteous, Commercial Director at China marketing & strategy agency TONG Global, told Business Insider.\n\nGeopolitical tensions between the US and China are also making it harder for Nike, encouraging consumers to favor domestic competitors.\n\n\"I think that Nike has failed to adapt to the cultural values of China's Gen-Z, \" he said, adding: \"Some netizens observe that while Nike's content is high quality, it feels less authentic and more brand-controlled — making it less accessible for a generation who crave personalisation and self-expression.\"\n\nRivals such as Lululemon and Adidas have seen growth in China as they've found ways to connect with shoppers there, Yu said.\n\nAdidas does it through local trend collaborations and Lululemon via its \"highly engaged value-based\" communities,\" she said.\n\nIt's not just through its messaging that it's losing consumers. Porteous said, Nike is also playing catch-up when it comes to digital engagement.\n\nIn China, shoppers often discover brands through apps and marketplaces such as WeChat, Douyin, and Tmall. Local rivals excel here with livestreaming, influencer collaborations, and interactive community campaigns.\n\nHowever, Nike's reliance on more traditional marketing channels means it is at a disadvantage in terms of visibility and relevance, especially among Gen Z shoppers.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Dec 18 (Reuters) - China on Thursday split off a Belgium-sized island with an economy comparable to a mid-sized country from the mainland for customs processing, part of a bid to join a major trans-Pacific trade deal and establish ​a new Hong Kong-style commercial hub.\n\nOfficials hope that turning the southern province of Hainan into a duty-free zone will spur foreign investment, ‌with goods that achieve at least 30% local value add able to move on into the world's second-largest economy tariff-free. Foreign firms will also be able to operate in service ‌sectors that are restricted on the mainland.\n\nChina is also seeking to boost its free-trade credentials to convince members of one of the world's largest free-trade deals, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), that it can meet the bloc's high standards for trade and investment openness through pilot projects such as the Hainan Free Trade Port.\n\n\"China aims to build the Hainan Free Trade Port into an important gateway that leads the country's opening-up into a new era,\" ⁠an editorial by the state news agency Xinhua said.\n\n\"It ‌is also expected to provide a huge boost for free trade that has been impacted by rising protectionism and unilateralism in recent years,\" the article added, in a veiled swipe at U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, which have pushed ‍policymakers to diversify China's $19 trillion economy from the world's top consumer market and take steps to further consolidate the manufacturing juggernaut's role in global supply chains.\n\nChina's leaders have made reversing a drop in investment a priority for next year, seeking to shift the economy from its current reliance on stimulus toward a dual focus on ​consumption and investment to stabilise growth in the near-term, while officials evaluate undertaking painful structural reforms needed to rebalance the economy long-term.\n\nForeign direct ‌investment into China fell 10.4% year-on-year in the first three quarters of 2025, official data shows.\n\nIf liberalisation succeeds in Hainan, economists say policymakers may feel emboldened to expose more of China's economy to market forces.\n\n\"The benchmark is something similar to Hong Kong,\" said Ran Guo, director for Consumer Economy at the China-Britain Business Council, who has been tracking the plan's developments for the past five years.\n\n\"In addition to boosting Hainan's tourism sector, the plan should also encourage more foreign investment and manufacturing,\" she added.",

    "description": "\"Our officers are dedicated.\"",
    "fullText": "A major international criminal vape shipment recently went up in smoke, due to the efforts of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials located near Chicago O'Hare International Airport.\n\nThe agency announced the bust in a press release and revealed the confiscated goods were worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. An inspection of a delivery from China en route to Mississippi uncovered 43,200 unlisted components of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS).\n\nMembers of the CBP and FDA at Chicago's Central Examination Station assessed that the goods both lacked proper FDA marketing permissions and were improperly valued. The criminals involved were trying to sneak in contraband and avoid paying taxes on it.\n\nOfficials identified the ENDS pieces as Kangvape Onee Sticks and valued the shipment at a whopping $358,000. That, of course, will not be cashed in by the parties in Mississippi, as the merchandise instead heads to the CBP's Fines, Penalties, and Forfeiture office.\n\n\"Our officers are dedicated to identifying and intercepting these types of shipments which could potentially harm the health and well-being of people within our communities,\" said LaFonda D. Sutton-Burke, the office's director of field operations.\n\nSutton-Burke is on the money. The vaping industry is linked to negative health impacts, particularly among young people whom the products often target. Getting them hooked on tobacco comes with severe long-term risks.\n\nMeanwhile, vapes are a menace to the environment due to their mishmash of components. The improper disposal of single-use plastics, toxic e-waste, and lithium batteries they are composed of poses a major challenge.\n\nWhen tossed out into nature, they can leach dangerous chemicals, be a hazard to tires and machinery, and be ingested by animals. When placed in trash or recycling bins, they pose a serious fire risk at landfills or recycling facilities.\n\nThere is encouraging news in the U.S., as increased education and awareness of vaping's health risks seem to be resonating among teenagers and reducing their use. Still, experts are worried about the impact of potential funding cuts.\n\nUndoubtedly, keeping illegal products off the streets, as the CBP did here, is another way to combat vaping.\n\nDo you think the U.S. should tax goods from China?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nAfter the latest seizure, the CBP remained steadfast in its mission to catch other would-be offenders.\n\n\"We will continue to work with our consumer product safety partners to identify and seize unsafe and illicit goods,\" Sutton-Burke concluded.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "title": "China may have reverse engineered EUV lithography tool in covert lab, report claims — employees given fake IDs to avoid secret project being detected, prototypes expected in 2028",
    "description": "China has reportedly built and begun testing a secret EUV lithography prototype using ASML-style laser-produced plasma technology. Yet, despite generating 13.5-nm light, the system remains unable to make chips and appears to be years away from achieving a complete, production-ready EUV manufacturing capability.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nA secret laboratory in China has quietly assembled a prototype extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography system and is now testing it stealthily, which means that the country may be close to replicating the most advanced technology that currently exists on Earth, reports Reuters.\n\nThe tool was reportedly developed by reverse engineering existing scanners from ASML and is said to be on-track to make prototype chips in 2028. If the information is correct, then Chinese scientists have made numerous breakthroughs across multiple disciplines in just a few years instead of decades, a scenario that appears extremely unlikely. Further analysis of the report indicates that China's laboratory is far from completing the tool, meaning that the country is years away from making chips using EUV lithography.\n\nThe system was reportedly completed in early 2025 inside a highly secured facility in Shenzhen and occupies nearly an entire factory floor. The Chinese machine reportedly generates EUV light with a wavelength of 13.5nm using the same laser-produced plasma (LPP) method as ASML Twinscan NXE machines, not the particle accelerator-based steady-state microbunching (SSMB) method designed at Tsinghua University or discharge-produced plasma (DPP) technology developed at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), which might prove the point that the system was reverse-engineered or at least contains a substantial amount of technologies pioneered by ASML.\n\nASML's laser-produced plasma (LPP) method uses tiny molten tin droplets, roughly 25–30 microns in diameter, which are injected into a vacuum chamber at a rate of about 50,000 droplets per second. Then, a high-power CO₂ laser first fires a low-intensity pre-pulse at each droplet, flattening it into a disk-like shape, followed by a more powerful main pulse that vaporizes the flattened tin and creates a superheated plasma with temperatures exceeding 200,000°C. This plasma emits isotropic EUV light, which is then collected by a large multilayer collector mirror and directed into the lithography system's reflective optics for patterning silicon wafers. This process repeats tens of thousands of times per second.\n\nThe machine is reportedly larger than the original, but it is operational in the sense that it can generate EUV radiation. However, it has not progressed to make usable chips as it still struggles to replicate 'the precision optical systems' features by Twinscan NXE systems. Furthermore, there is no word about power of the EUV light source, a crucial parameter that defines whether a tool can or cannot be used for volume production.\n\nThe report clearly states that the Chinese EUV scanner cannot currently be used to make chips, but the Chinese government reportedly wants the first chip prototypes to emerge in 2028, two or three years down the road. However, a more realistic target is 2030, four or five years from now, which is a long time. Meanwhile, from the report, it is not completely clear what stage the Chinese team is at today.\n\nThe report does not disclose which specific components of the optical system are the primary bottlenecks, as the article groups them rather generally. In particular, it is uncertain if the alleged EUV tool struggles to replicate the ultra-precise collector mirror system coated with multilayer molybdenum-silicon (Mo/Si) stacks, illuminator optics (which shapes and uniforms the beam using faceted mirrors), or projection optics (a series of aspheric mirrors for 4X – 8X reduction imaging with sub-nanometer wavefront errors). ASML outsources the development and production of these components to Carl Zeiss from Germany. If the developers failed to replicate the collector itself, then the rest of the machine can hardly be called an EUV lithography system, as technically, the only thing they have is some kind of light source that they have yet to learn how to use. Yet, even if the developers cannot replicate illuminator optics or projection optics (suggesting that the collector itself is there), it still means they do not have even a poorly working EUV lithography tool, but rather a set of certain components.\n\nWhen talking about advanced lithography equipment, we must keep in mind that such tools rely on seamless integration of sophisticated light sources, advanced optics, ultra-precise mechanical engineering, complex control software, and specialized materials, all of which must function reliably within nanometer-scale tolerances demanded by modern chip manufacturing. The story has no word about the state of the mechanical systems of the alleged tool: we know nothing about the wafer stocker system, wafer stages, or reticle stages, all of which are crucial for operation and yields.\n\nTo put China's EUV efforts into perspective, the secret lab is not even close to building an alpha tool. For now, what the Chinese lab has cannot even put the light on a wafer, save for printing lines and spaces, something ASML's tool could do in 2006, about 11 years before the company shipped its first Twinscan NXE:3400B system meant for high-volume manufacturing. Of course, reverse engineering certain components can give Chinese engineers a speed boost, but it remains to be seen how significant this one is going to be.\n\nAccording to Reuters's sources familiar with the effort, the Chinese EUV tool was 'developed' by a team that includes former engineers from ASML and recent university graduates, who allegedly reverse-engineered the company's EUV machines. The secret lab was so stealthy that its employees were given fake IDs to avoid detection of their concentration in one place by foreign spies.\n\nYet, it is unclear how any engineers from China could reverse engineer an EUV lithography scanner, as the Dutch company has never supplied one to China and hardly taught personnel from China how to service its EUV systems that are not allowed to be shipped to the People's Republic.\n\nReverse engineering a machine that contains over 100,000 parts is a hard task that takes hundreds of engineers with knowledge of the matter, which is why the secret entity led by the Government of China hired not only former engineers from ASML China, but also former employees of the Dutch company from elsewhere, presumably from Europe, Taiwan, and the U.S. For example, Lin Nan, formerly responsible for EUV light source technology at ASML, now leads a team at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Shanghai Institute of Optics that has filed eight EUV-related patents in just 18 months. Yet, this may mean that he uses his experience and knowledge rather than trying to replicate what he did at ASML or reverse engineer what he did at ASML due to the absence of an EUV scanner in his lab.\n\n“It makes sense that companies would want to replicate our technology, but doing so is no small feat,” a statement by ASML published by Reuters reads.\n\nThe report says that around 100 recent university graduates are tasked with reverse-engineering parts from EUV and DUV lithography tools, with each workplace monitored by a dedicated camera that records the disassembly and reassembly process, an important part of the whole China's lithography program, according to the report. Employees who successfully put components back together receive bonuses. Yet again, a Twinscan NXE tool is a mechanism consisting of over 100,000 parts working together, not just a sum of all parts.\n\nTo sum up, China has reportedly built a secret prototype EUV lithography system and begun testing it, which suggests that the country may be closer to reproducing the most advanced chipmaking technology in existence than previously believed. However, details provided by the report indicate that China is still years — if not a decade — away from making chips using EUV lithography.\n\nThe machine can generate 13.5-nm EUV light using the same laser-produced plasma (LPP) method employed by ASML, which may demonstrate extensive reverse engineering of Western technology rather than the use of alternative domestic approaches. However, the tool is significantly larger than commercial systems available today, it cannot produce usable chips, and appears to struggle with other elements of EUV lithography, particularly ultra-precise optics supplied to ASML by Carl Zeiss. In fact, details about the system like light source power, optical subsystem maturity, and the state of critical mechanical components remain unclear.\n\nWhile China expects first prototype EUV chips to emerge in 2028, Reuters's sources suggest 2030 is more realistic. Yet, the whole effort relies heavily on recruiting former ASML engineers and reverse engineering parts from existing EUV and DUV tools, which are not only hard to develop, but are extremely hard to make. Meanwhile, there is no word whether the current team responsible for disassembling and reassembling components can actually make an ultra-complex machine consisting of over 100,000 parts work flawlessly to produce semiconductors in high volumes.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.",

    "description": "China warns that a massive $11.1 billion U.S. weapons sale to Taiwan could spark war, calling the island a \"powder keg\" amid rising tensions.",
    "fullText": "China denounced the United States for approving an $11.1 billion weapons package for Taiwan, warning that the deal risks turning the island into a \"powder keg\" and driving the region toward \"military confrontation and war.\"\n\nThe unprecedented sale includes 82 HIMARS launchers paired with 420 ATACMS long-range missiles, a combination that would give Taiwan new deep-strike capability across the Taiwan Strait, along with 60 self-propelled howitzers, advanced UAV systems, military software packages and anti-armor weapons.\n\nBeijing accused Taiwan’s leadership of \"seeking independence through force\" and claimed Washington is using the island to \"contain China,\" rhetoric that signals heightened tensions even as the U.S. frames the package as essential to bolstering Taiwan’s self-defense.\n\n\"The ‘Taiwan independence’ forces on the island seek independence through force and resist reunification through force, squandering the hard-earned money of the people to purchase weapons at the cost of turning Taiwan into a powder keg,\" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said.\n\nChina’s Missile Surge Puts Every Us Base In The Pacific At Risk — And The Window To Respond Is Closing\n\n\"This cannot save the doomed fate of ‘Taiwan independence’ but will only accelerate the push of the Taiwan Strait toward a dangerous situation of military confrontation and war. The U.S. support for ‘Taiwan Independence’ through arms will only end up backfiring. Using Taiwan to contain China will not succeed.\"\n\nU.S. officials have not yet detailed delivery timelines, but the sale reflects Washington’s push to accelerate Taiwan’s defenses amid growing concern over China’s military pressure campaign. The HIMARS and ATACMS combination is expected to draw particular attention from Beijing because it would allow Taiwan to target PLA staging areas, ships and infrastructure from mobile launchers, a capability China has repeatedly warned against.\n\nIn its notification to Congress, the State Department said the proposed sales would advance \"U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient’s continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.\"\n\nThe department added that the weapons would \"help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance and economic progress in the region.\"\n\nUnder longstanding U.S. policy, Washington provides Taiwan with arms it deems necessary for the island’s self-defense while maintaining a \"One China\" policy and not supporting a declaration of formal independence. China argues that any enhancement of Taiwan’s defenses encourages separatism, while U.S. officials say the purpose of such sales is to preserve stability and deter conflict.\n\nHigh Stakes On The High Seas As Us, China Test Limits Of Military Power\n\nThe package now enters a 30-day congressional review period, during which lawmakers could file a resolution attempting to block it, a step Congress has never taken for an arms sale to Taiwan. Once the review period ends, contracting and production begin, a process that typically stretches over several years and contributes to a backlog that once reached $20 billion in undelivered U.S. weapons Taiwan has already purchased.\n\nChina has a track record of responding to major Taiwan arms sales with military demonstrations, including large-scale PLA drills, increased air and naval activity near the island and sanctions on U.S. defense firms. Analysts say Beijing’s sharp rhetoric suggests additional military signaling is likely, though China did not immediately announce specific countermeasures.\n\nThe latest sale marks a significant boost to Taiwan’s conventional firepower. In recent months, Beijing has stepped up pressure across the strait with near-daily PLA air and naval patrols, record incursions around the island and high-profile exercises meant to signal its ability to encircle Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan’s Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung thanked the U.S. Wednesday for its \"long-term support for regional security and Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities,\" which he said are key to deterring a conflict in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "China's deepening property crisis has crushed household wealth and dented the fortunes of some of its biggest tycoons — but a new class of AI-era billionaires is rising fast.\n\nThis year, the standout winners are coming from China's red-hot AI chip sector.\n\nOn Wednesday, shares of MetaX Integrated Circuits Shanghai — a GPU startup founded by former AMD executives — skyrocketed as much as 755% on their first day of trading on the Shanghai Stock Exchange's tech-focused STAR Market, before closing up about 700%.\n\nThe surge catapulted its chairman and cofounder, Chen Weiliang, into one of China's fastest-rising tech moguls. Chen's stake in MetaX is worth about $6.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nOther early insiders also saw eye-popping paper gains.\n\nMetaX's other two cofounders and co-chief technology officers, Peng Li and Yang Jian, hold stakes worth hundreds of millions of dollars after the blockbuster debut, according to Bloomberg's calculations.\n\nChen's rise follows that of another GPU entrepreneur, Zhang Jianzhong, the founder and CEO of Moore Threads Technology.\n\nEarlier this month, Zhang's net worth jumped to $4.3 billion after his company's successful IPO, continuing a wave of investor enthusiasm for homegrown semiconductor players.\n\nThe richest figure in China's AI chip scene is Chen Tianshi, a cofounder and CEO of Cambricon Technologies — a company retail traders have dubbed \"China's Nvidia.\"\n\nCambricon's Chen is now worth $22.5 billion, making him the country's 16th-richest individual on Bloomberg's list. He is the 115th richest person in the world.\n\nThese new fortunes reflect a sharp shift in investor sentiment.\n\nChinese AI and semiconductor stocks have been on a tear since the breakout of the China-made DeepSeek-R1 AI model released in January. The model helped spark a rally in local tech names and pushed the Hang Seng Tech Index up more than 20% so far this year.\n\nWashington's tightening export controls on advanced Nvidia chips also contributed to the boom.\n\nSuch restrictions on high-end AI processors have choked China's access to cutting-edge US hardware and pushed Beijing to lean harder on domestic suppliers.\n\nStill, China's new AI billionaires remain far from the top of the country's wealth rankings. The upper tier is still dominated by long-established tycoons.\n\nIn the top spot is Zhong Shanshan, the low-key bottled-water magnate behind Nongfu Spring, with a fortune of $68.1 billion, per Bloomberg.\n\nPony Ma, a cofounder and CEO of Tencent, ranks second with $66.5 billion — a fortune up 38% this year, on the heels of Tencent's AI-induced rally — while ByteDance cofounder Zhang Yiming comes in third with $65.2 billion.",

    "description": "Erik on product management and such",
    "fullText": "DILEMMA WORKS\nErik on product management and such\n\nOn China Speed\n\nHow Chinese firms work and how they perform in the market is a matter of perspective that gives entirely opposite outcomes. If you are outside of China and see the brands emerging on the global market - BYD, DJI, Insta360, OnePlus before the merger with OPPO, etc. - you may be of the view that their companies are unstoppable because they manage to combine high-performing products, a good user- and ownership experience, quality, competitive pricing, with high speed of execution. They simply design an launch new products faster than anyone else can. You may therefore have formed that “China Speed’ is the key to competing with China’s global brands.\n\nIf you are inside China, however, you will instead view these firms as unicorns, and your view will instead be filled with the hundreds or thousands of firms that fail to move past push-selling and price competition, brands that are unknown or have negative connotations because of shoddy product quality and after-sales service. You are more likely to see chuhai, or growing into the global market, as something almost unachievable.\n\nSpeed is a significant strategic advantage provided that you are moving in the right direction, meaning you have a strategy, and you do so without sacrificing quality.\n\nChina Speed is now one of the concepts that are going to be taken at face level and bragged about by the same people who have recently started talking about how they work 996 (they don’t).\n\nLike with 996, China Speed is fundamentally misunderstood and therefore can never be applied outside of China. There are in fact two types of China Speed. The productive type does not come from doing things quickly at all. It comes from structural advantages that have been built over decades, like having your office next to the factory, which itself is next to all of its relevant suppliers.\n\nIn the example of BYD, their advantage is not only that they own their factories and that 70% of their components are made by suppliers owned by the BYD group, or that they can get better margins by controlling prices. What really creates and advantage is that they can design and prototype a new model, together with the parts that go into it that will be manufactured by its suppliers, instead of having to go through long contract negotiations to get the parts that enable a new model to be launched.\n\nBYD employees undoubtedly work longer hours and perhaps at a higher pace than automotive employees in Europe, but it is not what makes up BYD’s formula for success, because the structural advantage is in place after decades of methodical construction. Unlike employees at TikTok Shop, which I below reference as an example of destructive speed, BYD employees are not pushing on a string.\n\nThe destructive type is focusing on doing everything, doing anything no matter what it is, just as long as you do it quickly. In organizations that favor this type of speed, China Speed is a form of procrastination at the leadership level, so that they will not have to do the hard work of forming a vision and making decisions that can prove to either be good or bad. They fear the latter outcome, so they tell their teams to do things quickly, just A/B test something, actually a lot of things, and show me the results of the things that happen to work out, so I can put it in my report and show leadership.\n\nThis is speed, no chaos, as a value above everything. It sacrifices quality, it sacrifices relationships with business partners as well as customers and it destroys the brand. In another essay I’m currently working on, I will outline how Chinese firms grow in the global markets, what stages they go through and what organizational capabilities they must build up. The firms that try to just be faster will never get past the second stage, which is price leadership, and many don’t even get past stage one.\n\nThese leaders say they really care about data, but they don’t because they don’t make any decisions. They want experiment results, and they want to show them as achievements to their managers. But they never use data to inform strategy.\n\nFor Chinese firms going global, focusing on speed above all else means that failure is a given. Lets look at ByteDance and their TikTok Shop as an example. You would probably say that ByteDance, through TikTok, is an example of a Chinese organization that is adept at launching global products. But ByteDance did not build TikTok, they acquired musical.ly and its 240 million userbase and re-branded it. It is only through this foundation they have been successful.\n\nWhen ByteDance try to build global products from 0, they have a much lower rate of success, and TikTok Shop is a monumental failure in every region it has been launched - in UK and Europe, in the US and in Southeast Asia.\n\nThis is the story from Indonesia:\n\nLast year, TikTok’s parent company, ByteDancei, acquired a majority stake in its Indonesian online retail rival, Tokopedia, to abide by local laws that restrict social media companies from running e-commerce businesses. Following the acquisition, TikTok tucked its app interface into Tokopedia, and rebranded the platform as TikTok Shop by Tokopedia.\n\nThe merger has disrupted Indonesia’s $65 billion e-commerce market, Simon Torring, co-founder of market research firm Cube Asia told Rest of World. Since the acquisition, TikTok has laid off at least 2,500 employees across the merged entity, while sellers say they have lost agency over the platform.\n\n“Tokopedia’s sales volume has continued to decline steadily after ByteDance’s acquisition,” Torring told Rest of World. “For the first couple of quarters, we gave them the benefit of the doubt of being a new owner carrying out messy integration work. At this point, it’s clear that they are not investing strategically in Tokopedia.”\n\n“I’m not planning to make videos or to do livestream [to promote my products],” Helmin, a seller from Jakarta, told Rest of World. Helmin, who asked to be identified by her first name only, said she directed buyers to her Shopee store instead, where she continues to sell snacks and beverages imported from Korea, Vietnam, and Turkey.\n\nSo messy has TikTok’s merger been that it’s driven thousands of sellers to Toco, a little-known platform promising zero fees for life. Shopee and TikTok take a 2.5% cut from each sale.\n\n“In Southeast Asia, Chinese companies usually invest [in other companies], instead of managing [them] directly, like how Shopee is backed by Tencent and Lazada by Alibaba,” Ming Yii Lai, research manager at Shanghai-based Daxue Consulting, told Rest of World. “[Now], they localize their operations, with independent CEOs making very fast decisions.”\n\nThat strategy isn’t paying off in Indonesia, where many sellers say Tokopedia has “lost its soul” and been “reduced to just another generic Chinese marketplace,” a Jakarta-based seller wrote in a LinkedIn post. “There’s nothing wrong with that on paper, but the truth is, Indonesians shop differently. We look for connection, for trust, for the sense that we’re part of something local and meaningful.”\n\n— restofworld.org, July 2025\n\nIn the UK, TikTok Shop has had massive organizational and leadership problems and had to rebuild the organization several times since 2021:\n\nA culture clash between TikTok’s Chinese owners and some of its London employees has triggered a staff exodus and complaints about an aggressive corporate ethos that runs counter to typical working practices in the UK.\n\nThe friction has centred on the social media company’s ecommerce initiative, TikTok Shop, which launched in the UK in October. Joshua Ma, a senior executive at China’s ByteDance — owner of the viral video app — and the head of ecommerce at TikTok Europe, outraged London-based staff at a dinner this year when he said that, as a “capitalist”, he “didn’t believe” companies should offer maternity leave.\n\nThe episode is emblematic of a broader clash within the ecommerce division. At least 20 members of the London ecommerce team — around half of all its original staff — have left since TikTok Shop’s launch, while others say they are on the brink of quitting. Two employees have been paid settlements over working conditions.\n\n“There are people leaving every week, it is like a game — every Monday we ask who has been fired, who has quit,” one current employee said.\n\n— FT, June 2022\n\nThis is essentially four lost years and billions in investment burned because ByteDance wanted to move fast. In 2025, TikTok Shop has been re-launched in beta in the UK:\n\nAlthough the launch of TikTok Shop bodes well for business on paper, in practice its launch could be significantly more complicated.\n\nThis isn’t TikTok’s first ride in the rodeo of social commerce, after all. Culture clashes between TikTok’s Chinese owners and London staff tainted TikTok Shop’s UK launch in 2021.\n\nReports of burnout and tension between staff and former TikTok head of ecommerce Europe, Joshua Ma, led to an exodus of more than 20 members from the London team.\n\nThis rocky start was followed by a lack of traction, with the Shop operating at a loss and many live streams generating zero sales.\n\n— startups.co.uk, June 2025\n\nAn overall review of TikTok Shop’s on-going struggles in various markets can be found at Toutiao:\n\nA TikTok employee told Caijing Tianxia Weekly that Chinese nationals working overseas are mostly in technical roles, which typically involve a relatively stable and flexible pace. Given their familiarity with ByteDance’s work model, they generally adapt well to TikTok’s environment. However, TikTok Shop—a fledgling e-commerce division under significant revenue pressure—demands much higher work intensity. Since this department relies heavily on local operational talent, clashes inevitably arose.\n\nThis incident is merely one facet of the broader cultural conflicts TikTok faces overseas. Many perceive TikTok’s e-commerce expansion as aggressively “wild-growing,” yet it continually struggles with localization—a challenge common to all Chinese tech companies going global.\n\n…\n\nAs ByteDance’s primary vehicle for global expansion, TikTok has made significant inroads in numerous markets. However, managing dispersed teams across the US, UK, Japan, Brazil, Germany, Singapore, and elsewhere inevitably presents complex challenges.\n\nAJ (a pseudonym), a research and development engineer at TikTok’s US office, told Caijing Tianxia Weekly that in his R&D team, 70% of employees are of Chinese descent. Since TikTok evolved from Musical.ly—a Shanghai-based company—much of the inherited code documentation remains in Chinese, creating language barriers for foreign staff.\n\n…\n\nAJ believes this is nearly impossible at TikTok. In his R&D team, managers (mostly of Chinese descent) oversee 30–40 people each—a ratio “unimaginable in the US,” where frontline managers typically supervise only 5–6 individuals (only senior managers handle 30–40).\n\nFurther problems caused by the single-minded focus on speed at TikTok Shop US can be read about in Special Submission | My Two and a Half Years at ByteDance E-Commerce in the U.S.: From Hope to Disillusionment which was written by a Chinese engineer.\n\nLet’s list all the numerous problems it has created:\n\nStrategy — ByteDance assumes that live commerce, which shows promising signs in China but is by far not proven as a new model of e-commerce instead of a niche, will work in other locales. They have not done the work to prove the model, but simply chose the path of replicating exactly what they did in China, and doing so quickly.\nIn reality, live commerce has existed since at least the 1990s, most notably with QVC, and has only ever been a minor share of retail. It suits only a minor segment of customers, and only fits promotion-driven companies and most often low-cost products.Organization - Most employees, even Chinese transplants, leave after a year or two, and foreign employees rarely last a year. They have had to rebuild the organization multiple times in each locale.Partner relationships - Sellers that have worked with TikTok Shop swear to never do so again, due to how hard they were pushed, how poorly they were treated, and how much money they lost.Revenue - Every year, in each locale, TikTok Shop significantly underperforms its set goals. You may say that maybe they just set aggressive goals — but if you set goals that everyone knows cannot be met, then there are no goals, and without goals there can be no strategy. And that is exactly right: TikTok Shop is a flailing operation without strategy, for which a singular focus on doing things quickly has been replaced.\n\nThis is why Chinese teams have 30-40 team members, why leaders are too overwhelmed to think strategically, why people leave quickly, why people have to work 996 but accomplish less than 965, why being “data-driven” is nonsense when you are only looking at A/B tests of random, guess-work features and traffic that may go up due to promotion-driven campaigns, while the house is on fire.\n\nWhat did DJI and Insta360 do differently to become the first Chinese, global category leaders in drones, gimbals and cameras?\n\nThey built separate organizations for China and International markets, they hired people with experience and knowledge of the markets inside China HQ and outside of China in the regional offices, and based on these capabilities they created strategies for their respective markets. They never brought leaders from the China market to copy paste tactics that worked in China, and they never sent people who couldn’t speak English to lead their international offices. As a result, they have the strongest brands and the best products on the market.\n\nSo, as a summary, the productive type of speed is not a strategy and it is not an organizational value. Speed is an outcome from building an organization and an environment to operate in that makes resources accessible. Whenever speed itself is used as a strategy, it is the destructive type of speed that is being used. And whenever speed is used instead of strategy and proper organizational design, it is because leadership has abdicated its responsibility to do exactly these things.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has announced a massive package of arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion that includes medium-range missiles, howitzers and drones, a move that is sure to infuriate China.\n\nThe State Department announced the sales late Wednesday during a nationally televised address by President Donald Trump, who made scant mention of foreign policy issues and did not speak about China or Taiwan at all. U.S.-Chinese tensions have ebbed and flowed during Trump’s second term, largely over trade and tariffs but also over China’s increasing aggressiveness toward Taiwan, which Beijing has said must reunify with the mainland.\n\nThe eight arms sales agreements announced Wednesday cover 82 high-mobility artillery rocket systems, or HIMARS, and 420 Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS — similar to what the U.S. had been providing Ukraine during the Biden administration to defend itself from Russia — worth more than $4 billion. They also include 60 self-propelled howitzer systems and related equipment worth more than $4 billion and drones valued at more than $1 billion.\n\nOther sales in the package include military software valued at more than $1 billion, Javelin and TOW missiles worth more than $700 million, helicopter spare parts worth $96 million and refurbishment kits for Harpoon missiles worth $91 million.\n\nIn separate but nearly identical statements, the State Department said the sales serve “U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient’s continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.”\n\n“The proposed sale(s) will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,” the statements said.\n\nUnder federal law, the U.S. is obligated to assist Taiwan with its self-defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China, which has vowed to take Taiwan by force, if necessary.\n\nTaiwan's Defense Ministry in a statement Thursday expressed gratitude to the U.S. over the arms sale, which it said would help Taiwan maintain “sufficient self-defense capabilities” and bring strong deterrent capabilities. Taiwan's bolstering of its defense “is the foundation for maintaining regional peace and stability,” the ministry said.\n\nTaiwan's Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung similarly thanked the U.S. for its “long-term support for regional security and Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities,” which he said are key for deterring a conflict in the Taiwan Strait, the body of water separating Taiwan from China's mainland.\n\nThe arms sales comes as Taiwan's government has pledged to raise defense spending to 3.3% of the island's gross domestic product next year and to reach 5% by 2030. The boost came after Trump and the Pentagon requested that Taiwan spend as much as 10% of its GDP on its defense, a percentage well above what the U.S. or any of its major allies spend on defense. The demand has faced pushback from Taiwan's opposition KMT party and some of its population.\n\nTaiwanese President Lai Ching-te last month announced a special $40 billion budget for arms purchases, including to build an air defense system with high-level detection and interception capabilities called Taiwan Dome. The budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033.\n\nThe U.S. boost in military assistance to Taiwan was previewed in legislation adopted by Congress that Trump is expected to sign shortly.\n\nLast week, the Chinese embassy in Washington denounced the legislation, known as the National Defense Authorization Act, saying it unfairly targeted China as an aggressor.\n\n“The bill has kept playing up the ‘China threat’ narrative, trumpeting for military support to Taiwan, abusing state power to go after Chinese economic development, limiting trade, economic and people-to-people exchanges between China and the U.S., undermining China’s sovereignty, security and development interests and disrupting efforts of the two sides in stabilizing bilateral relations,” Beijing’s embassy in Washington said after the legislation passed the House.\n\n“China strongly deplores and firmly opposes this,” it said.\n\nThe U.S. Senate passed the bill Wednesday.\n\nMistreanu reported from Beijing. AP video journalist Johnson Lai in Taipei, Taiwan, contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "A report from Reuters claims that scientists in China have created a prototype of a machine that could eventually be used to produce semiconductor chips capable of powering artificial intelligence. Sources told the publication that a team in Shenzhen completed the prototype of an extreme ultraviolet lithography machine earlier this year and it is allegedly now undergoing testing. The EUV machine was reportedly made by former engineers from Dutch semiconductor supplier ASML. Reuters states that China is targeting production of its own EUV chips beginning in 2028, although other experts have projected 2030 as a more likely date.\n\nEUV is a supremely complicated bit of technology; we have an explainer below that gets into some of the details. It is at the heart of the chips made by companies such as Intel and TSMC, so any company trying to compete would also need access to EUV. Although the Chinese prototype is not yet making chips, it is reportedly able to generate the extreme ultraviolet light needed for chip manufacturing.\n\nIf confirmed, this development would put China in control of tech much sooner than analysts had previously expected. To date, EUV has largely been kept out of reach by Western companies and used as a bargaining chip by the US government. Chinese President Xi Jinping has placed a high priority on the country being able to produce its own semiconductors. \"The aim is for China to eventually be able to make advanced chips on machines that are entirely China-made,\" a source told Reuters. \"China wants the United States 100 percent kicked out of its supply chains.\"",

    "fullText": "SHANGHAI, Dec 17 (Reuters) - MetaX Integrated Circuits jumped 700% in its Shanghai market debut as the Chinese AI chipmaker tapped into strong momentum triggered by Beijing's push to reduce reliance on chips from U.S. firms Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).\n\nFounded by former AMD executives, MetaX raised roughly $600 million in an initial public ​offering last week, days after larger rival Moore Threads debuted with a 400% pop.\n\nMetaX opened at 700 yuan a share in Shanghai versus an IPO price of ‌104.66 yuan, before surging as high as 895 yuan, defying persistent AI bubble concerns in other markets. The stock ended the trading session at 829.9 yuan, up 693%.\n\n\"It's another IPO tale in China that turns a crow into ‌a phoenix,\" said fund manager Yang Tingwu at Tongheng Investment.\n\nThe price surge \"creates huge arbitrage opportunities\" for pre-IPO investors, Yang said, and \"we're likely witnessing the stock's peak level for the next five years\".\n\nMakers of artificial intelligence (AI) chips are rushing to sell shares in China to capitalise on interest generated by a government drive to boost local production in competition with the U.S.\n\n\"AI and semiconductors are key areas of competition in the Sino-U.S. tech rivalry,\" Guotai Haitong Securities said in a report ahead of MetaX's listing. \"Against the backdrop of geopolitical tension, AI chipmaking has huge growth potential,\" as China seeks to achieve self-sufficiency.\n\nResearcher ⁠Frost & Sullivan forecast China AI chip sales to top $189 billion ‌by 2029 versus $54 billion in 2026.\n\nMetaX, which makes graphics processing units (GPUs), raised 4.2 billion yuan ($596 million) last week in a share sale that was more than 4,000 times oversubscribed by retail investors.\n\nThe IPO - China's sixth biggest so far this year, according to KPMG - priced the money-losing ‍startup at 50 times its 2024 sales. That compared with a multiple of 34 for Nvidia and 14 for AMD, MetaX said in a pre-listing statement.\n\nMetaX's debut catapulted the value of the five-year-old startup to more than 300 billion yuan ($42.58 billion) and boosted the wealth of founder and major shareholder Chen Weiliang, 49.\n\nAfter working for AMD Shanghai for 13 years, Chen founded MetaX with a mission to \"contribute to China's rejuvenation ​and national prosperity.\" The founding team also included Peng Li and Yang Jian, both former AMD engineers.\n\n\"The company is a leading GPU maker in China thanks to its AMD gene,\" ‌Li Hui, analyst at Huajin Securities, said in a report ahead of MetaX's listing.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE Dec 17 - In a high-security Shenzhen laboratory, Chinese scientists have built what Washington has spent years trying to prevent: a prototype of a machine capable of producing the cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence, smartphones and weapons central to Western military dominance, Reuters has learned.\n\nCompleted in early 2025 and now undergoing testing, the prototype fills nearly an entire factory floor. It was built by a team of former engineers from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML who reverse-engineered the company's extreme ultraviolet lithography machines or EUVs, according to two people with knowledge of the project.\n\nEUV machines sit at the heart of a technological Cold War. They use beams of extreme ultraviolet light to etch circuits thousands of times thinner than a human hair onto silicon wafers, currently a capability monopolized by the West. The ​smaller the circuits, the more powerful the chips.\n\nChina's machine is operational and successfully generating extreme ultraviolet light, but has not yet produced working chips, the people said.\n\nIn April, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet said that China would need \"many, many years\" to develop such technology. But the existence of this prototype, reported by Reuters for the first time, suggests China may be years closer to achieving semiconductor independence than analysts anticipated.\n\nNevertheless, China still faces major ‌technical challenges, particularly in replicating the precision optical systems that Western suppliers produce.\n\nThe availability of parts from older ASML machines on secondary markets has allowed China to build a domestic prototype, with the government setting a goal of producing working chips on the prototype by 2028, according to the two people.\n\nBut those close to the project say a more realistic target is 2030, which is still years earlier than the decade that analysts believed it would take China to match the West on chips.\n\nChinese authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a six-year government initiative to achieve ‌semiconductor self-sufficiency, one of President Xi Jinping's highest priorities. While China's semiconductor goals have been public, the Shenzhen EUV project has been conducted in secret, according to the people.\n\nThe project falls under the country's semiconductor strategy, which state media has identified as being run by Xi Jinping confidant Ding Xuexiang, who heads the Communist Party's Central Science and Technology Commission.",

    "fullText": "TOKYO (AP) — Thousands of people flocked to Tokyo's Ueno zoo to have a last glimpse of the popular twin pandas that are set to return to China next month, worried if or when they get to see their replacement in Japan as Tokyo's relations with Beijing sunk.\n\nThe Tokyo metropolitan government announced Monday that Xiao Xiao and his sister Lei Lei will return to China in late January and that their last day of public viewing will be Jan. 25.\n\nTheir departure will leave Japan without a panda for the first time in more than half a century. Prospects for their replacement are not favorable as ties between the two countries have plunged in recent weeks.\n\nGiant pandas are native to southwestern China and serve as an unofficial national mascot. Beijing lends them to other countries as a sign of goodwill but maintains ownership over them and any cubs they produce.\n\nYuki Imai, a panda fan visiting from the neighboring Kanagawa prefecture, said she was shocked by the news of the twins' return and decided to visit. “I thought I should come and see them soon while I still can.”\n\nMany queued for more than two hours to get to see the twins for one minute. Kazuhiro Yamamoto said he came to see the pandas with his wife Hiroko “for the one last time,” and that the twins may be returning sooner due to the rocky relations.\n\nThe four-year-old twins were born at Tokyo's Ueno Zoological Gardens in June, 2021, and raised there, but they remain on loan from China and must be returned by February.\n\nRelations between Japan and China have worsened since Japan’s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in early November that its military could get involved if China were to impose a naval blockade or other action against Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its own.\n\nChina has since restricted tourism to Japan, and cultural events and exchanges between local governments have been canceled.\n\nThe row escalated this month when Chinese drills involving an aircraft carrier near southern Japan prompted Tokyo to scramble fighter jets. Japan also protested that its aircraft were targeted by repeated radar-locking — a move considered as possible preparation for missile firing.\n\nTadashi Nakatani, a 51-year-old calligrapher at a temple who regularly visits from his hometown of Kamakura, west of Tokyo, said international relations may affect the panda diplomacy, but he has hope.\n\n“When things calm down and the relationship becomes stable, I sincerely hope that pandas will come again, and that a day will come when everyone can enjoy seeing them again.”\n\nChina sent the first pair of pandas to Japan in 1972 to mark the normalization of diplomatic ties between the two countries. Since then, Japan has never been left without a panda.\n\nThousands of visitors formed a long line outside the zoo Tuesday morning. During their one-minute viewing time at the panda zone, visitors called out the twins’ names and took photos or videos as the pair nibbled bamboo sticks or strolled around.\n\nBeginning next week, only up to 4,800 visitors who successfully booked their 1-minute slot online will be able to see the beloved twins, according to the zoo.\n\nJapan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said Monday that pandas have long been loved by Japanese people and he hoped the friendship through panda diplomacy between the two countries will continue.\n\n“Exchanges through pandas have contributed to improve the public sentiment between Japan and China, and we hope the relationship will continue,” Kihara said. He noted that a number of local municipalities and zoos have expressed hope that new pandas will be loaned out soon.\n\nUeno Zoological Gardens curator Hitoshi Suzuki, referring to the panda twins, said raising them in good health was challenging. “But they gave us many kinds of joy and surprise. They also brought great delight to our visitors. We have nothing but words of gratitude.”\n\nThe zoo plans to promote other animals to make up for the absence of the pandas, while waiting for their replacement. “We will keep the panda area for the time being, so that we can accommodate possible new arrivals at any time.”",

    "fullText": "China will impose tariffs of up to 19.8% on pork imports from the European Union, a drastic drop from preliminary tariffs of up to 62.4%, its Commerce Ministry said Tuesday.\n\nThe ministry's announcement followed an investigation the Chinese side launched into imports of pork from the trading bloc after the EU imposed provisional tariffs on China-made electric vehicles.\n\nBeijing also levied anti-dumping duties on European brandy, most notably cognac produced in France, though major brandy producers received exemptions. Imports of dairy products from the EU likewise were subject to anti-dumping probes.\n\nThe EU runs a massive trade deficit with China: over 300 billion euros ($348 billion) last year. However, the trading bloc is a major exporter of pork and key supplier of byproducts such as ears, snouts, feet and other items considered to be delicacies in China.\n\nIn September, China ordered preliminary anti-dumping duties, in the form of security deposits, of 15.6% to 32.7% for pork imports from EU companies that collaborated with the anti-dumping investigation, and up to 62.4% for all others.\n\nChina’s Commerce Ministry concluded that the EU was dumping pork and pig by-products in China, selling them at prices below production costs or domestic market prices, and harming China’s pork industry. The final tariff rates of 4.9%-19.8% are due to take effect beginning Wednesday and last for five years.\n\nSpain, the Netherlands and Denmark will be the most affected.\n\nThe Commerce Ministry said the new tariff will apply to all kind of pork products, fresh, chilled, frozen, dried, pickled, smoked or salted.\n\nIt said it had reached its conclusions in an “objective, fair and impartial manner.”\n\nEU exports of pork products to China peaked at 7.4 billion euros ($7.9 billion) in 2020 when Beijing turned to imports to meet domestic demand after its pig farms were devastated by a swine disease. But it has reduced imports as it has rebuilt its herds.",

    "fullText": "TOKYO (AP) — Popular twin pandas at a Tokyo zoo are set to return to their homeland in China in late January, officials said Monday, leaving Japan without a panda for the first time in about half a century.\n\nProspects for their replacement are not favorable either as ties between the two countries have deteriorated.\n\nThe twins, Xiao Xiao and his sister Lei Lei, were born at Tokyo's Ueno Zoological Gardens in 2021, and raised, but they remain on loan from China and have to be returned by February.\n\nTheir parents Shin Shin and Ri Ri returned home last year after China loaned them for breeding research in 2011.\n\nThe last day of public viewing for the 4-year-old twins will be Jan. 25, according to the Tokyo metropolitan government.\n\nJapan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said pandas have long been loved by Japanese people and he hoped friendship through panda diplomacy between the two countries will continue.\n\n“Exchanges through pandas have contributed to improve the public sentiment between Japan and China, and we hope the relationship will continue,” Kihara said. He noted that a number of local municipalities and zoos have expressed hope that new pandas will to be loaned soon.\n\nChina sent the first pair of pandas to Japan in 1972 to mark the normalization of diplomatic ties between the two countries. Since then, Japan has never been left without a panda.\n\nGiant pandas are native to southwestern China and serve as an unofficial national mascot. Beijing lends them to other countries as a sign of goodwill but maintains ownership over them and any cubs they produce.\n\nRelations between Japan and China have worsened since Japan’s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in early November that its military could get involved if China were to take action against Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its own.\n\nChina has since restricted tourism to Japan, and cultural events and exchanges between local governments have been canceled. The row escalated this month when Chinese drills involving an aircraft carrier near southern Japan prompted Tokyo to scramble fighter jets. It also protested that Japanese aircraft were targeted by repeated radar-locking — a move considered as possible preparation for missile firing.",

    "description": "The volume of Venezuelan oil already headed to China before the U. seized a Venezuelan tanker last week, plus a glut of crude in storage and weak demand, will limit ​the near-term impact of the move in the Chinese market, traders and analysts said.",
    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The volume of Venezuelan oil already headed to China before the U.S. seized a Venezuelan tanker last week, plus a glut of crude in storage and weak demand, will limit ​the near-term impact of the move in the Chinese market, traders and analysts said.\n\nExports from the South American producer have ‌fallen sharply since the U.S. seized a tanker off Venezuela's coast and imposed new sanctions on shipping firms and vessels doing business with it, with the prospect of further ‌seizures deterring shipments.\n\nChina, the world's no. 1 oil importer, is the biggest buyer of Venezuelan crude, though Venezuelan supply accounts for only around 4% of its total crude imports.\n\nVenezuelan oil arrivals to China are on track to rise this month and next, traders and analysts say, thanks to a spate of exports over the previous four months, deepening discounts on crude that can take up to 60 days to reach the independent refiners ⁠that are its main buyers.\n\n\"The surge in Venezuela ‌flow to China increased in anticipation of sanctions,\" said Mukesh Sahdev, founder & CEO of energy consultancy XAnalysts. He predicted that the impact of the tanker seizure, and any additional sanctions or seizures, would be seen in ‍February.\n\nDecember China arrivals of Merey crude, Venezuela's main export grade, are expected to exceed 600,000 barrels per day, according to analysts at tanker tracker Vortexa. Kpler puts December Merey arrivals at 664,000 bpd, subject to revision, which it said would be a record.\n\nMOUNTING VOLUMES OF OIL IN FLOATING STORAGE\n\nThe Venezuelan supply comes ​on top of ample deliveries from other sanctioned producers Russia and Iran, which have led to mounting volumes of oil in floating ‌storage in Asia.\n\nAsian floating oil storage hit 71 million barrels last week, rising from 53 million barrels at end-October and about 33 million barrels in early September, Kpler data showed, adding to pressure that had deepened discounts on Venezuelan crude.\n\nAt least one-third of the estimated 650,000 bpd of Merey discharged in November in China is still looking for end-buyers, said Vortexa analyst Emma Li.\n\nTwo trade sources said plentiful Russian and Iranian supply, along with barrels on the way to China from Venezuela, had limited market worries for now.\n\nAnother trading manager at a regular ⁠buyer said it would take time to gauge the impact of the seizure ​on supplies, but that his company had shifted to buying \"small amounts\" of Canadian TMX ​crude to hedge against geopolitical risk.",

    "description": "The United States tops the remaining areas in an assessment of 74 technologies.",
    "fullText": "China is leading research in nearly 90% of the crucial technologies that “significantly enhance, or pose risks to, a country’s national interests”, according to a technology tracker run by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) — an independent think-tank.\n\nThe ASPI’s Critical Technology Tracker evaluated research on 74 current and emerging technologies this year, up from the 64 technologies it analyzed last year. China is ranked number one for research on 66 of the technologies, including nuclear energy, synthetic biology, small satellites, while the United States topped the remaining 8, including quantum computing and geoengineering.\n\nThe results reflect a drastic reversal. At the beginning of this century, the United States led more than 90% of the assessed technologies, whereas China led less than 5% of them, according to the 2024 edition of the tracker.\n\n“China has made incredible progress on science and technology that is reflected in research and development, as well as in publications,” says Ilaria Mazzocco, who researches China’s industrial policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a non-profit research organization based in Washington DC.\n\nMazzocco says the general trend identified by the ASPI is not a surprise, but it is “remarkable” to see that China is so dominant and advanced in so many fields compared with the United States.\n\nThis might have something to do with the type of technologies that are tracked, says Wang Yanbo, a science-policy researcher at the University of Hong Kong. The country is more likely to be a research leader in new technologies, where it has focused its efforts, compared to traditional fields where other country's lead, such as semi conductor chips, he notes.\n\nThe ASPI team based its analysis on a database that contains more than nine million publications from all around the world. It ranked nations in each technology by identifying the top 10% of the most-cited papers produced by researchers in a country over a five-year period, between 2020 and 2024, and calculated that country's global share.\n\nOne noteworthy finding is that China is outpacing the United States in cloud and edge computing, according to David Lin, a national security and technology strategist at the Special Competitive Studies Project, a non-profit organization based in Arlington, Virginia. Cloud computing enables artificial intelligence (AI) companies to train models and process data without the need for physical infrastructure, whereas edge computing processes data locally. China’s research intensity in these fields “probably reflects the urgency with which Beijing is moving AI from the lab into deployment”, Lin says.\n\nThe analysis should not be interpreted as “a collapse of American power”, says Steven Hai, a political economist focusing on technology innovation at Xi’an Jiaotong–Liverpool University in Suzhou, China. In general, the United States is still an important player globally in these technologies, Hai says.\n\nJenny Wong-Leung, a data scientist at ASPI who participated in the study, warns that the findings show democratic nations risk losing “hard-won, long-term advantages in cutting-edge science and research” in a range of essential sectors, which is the crucial for the development and advancement of the world’s most important technologies.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-04048-7\n\nGrowing cities face mounting challenges\n\nChina accounts for more than half of leading output in the applied sciences\n\nGeothermal networks let cities warm and cool as one\n\nWill young universities set the pace in the age of AI?\n\nWhat would an AI university look like and how might it change education?\n\nChina is leading the world on AI governance: other countries must engage\n\nAustralia’s world-first social media ban is a ‘natural experiment’ for scientists\n\nChina is leading the world on AI governance: other countries must engage\n\nThe top US health director who stood up for science — and was fired\n\nJoin HZAU's global faculty team to advance research with competitive benefits.\n\nNo.1 Shizishan Street, Hongshan District, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China\n\nHuazhong Agricultural University (HZAU)\n\nChair Professors / Professors / Associate Professors / Assistant Professors\n\nGreat Bay University, China (GBU)\n\nseeking outstanding, innovative tenured/tenure-track Principal Investigators to establish independent research programs\n\nExceptional young scholars worldwide with strong research achievements in relevant fields\n\nInstitute of Nanotechnology and Intelligence (inAI), Jinan University, China.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — Chinese demand for foreign luxury cars is waning as customers opt for more affordable Chinese brand models, often sold at big discounts, catering to their taste for fancy electronics and comfort.\n\nThat is bad news for European carmakers like Porsche, Aston Martin, Mercedes-Benz and BMW that have long dominated the upper reaches of the world's largest auto market.\n\nA slowing economy hits the luxury market\n\nA prolonged property downturn in China has left many consumers with little appetite for big purchases. Meanwhile, the well-to-do are becoming increasingly shy about publicly displaying their wealth, said Paul Gong, UBS head of China Automotive Industry Research.\n\nMany car buyers have been swayed by a 20,000 yuan ($2,830) trade-in subsidy offered by the Chinese government for purchasing electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. People tended to purchase cheaper, entry-level cars where the discount will count more and those cars are mostly Chinese made, Gong said.\n\n“Slowing economic growth is one key driver behind weaker demand for premium cars,” said Claire Yuan, director of corporate ratings for China autos at S&P Global Ratings, referring to a segment that typically counts car brands such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW.\n\nThe market share of premium car sales in China, usually priced above 300,000 yuan ($42,400), more than doubled between 2017 and 2023 to about 15% of total sales, S&P said.\n\nThat trend is now reversing. The share of premium cars sales fell to 14% in 2024 and to 13% in the first nine months of 2025, S&P said.\n\nChinese automakers take a bigger bite\n\nWhile luxury auto sales have slowed, Chinese manufacturers, including electric vehicle maker BYD, have become more aggressive than many Western brands in technological innovation, frequently rolling out new electric vehicles and hybrids at cheaper prices, including premium vehicles, analysts said.\n\n“Their (Chinese carmakers’) products are more competitive and more affordable even in the premium segment,” Yuan said. “That’s why these foreign brands are gradually losing momentum.”\n\nThe Chinese brands’ share of passenger car sales climbed to almost 70% in the first 11 months of this year, according to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. It reported Thursday that German brands held a 12% share, Japanese brands around 10% and U.S. brands nearly 6%.\n\nBYD already has overtaken Volkswagen as the biggest car seller in China in recent years. BYD is so far the best selling car brand this year in China for “new energy vehicles,” which include electric vehicles and hybrids, according to the China Passenger Car Association. BYD had cut prices of its electric and plug-in hybrid models by up to 34%, putting pressure on major rivals like Geely and Leapmotor.",

    "fullText": "The most valuable EV company in the world is based in the US, but Americans are buying fewer battery-powered vehicles.\n\nEV sales in North America fell 1% this year compared to 2024, according to data from supply chain data firm Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. The dip comes as the US has faced a combination of policy changes, tariffs, and supply chain upheavals this year.\n\nThere were 1.7 million EVs sold in North America between January and November — far behind the 11.6 million sold in China and below the 3.8 million sold in Europe.\n\nUS automaker execs have been sounding the alarm bells on sales. In September, Ford CEO Jim Farley predicted that the EV market share in the US would nearly halve to around 5% in the near term.\n\nBenchmark Mineral Intelligence cited the $7,500 EV tax credit ending in September as a reason for \"subdued\" sales in the US, along with the Trump administration relaxing rules for automakers designed to encourage the transition to EVs and hybrids.\n\nElon Musk's Tesla has had a rocky year in almost all of its biggest markets, but it weathered the October drop-off better than its rivals, according to separate data from Cox Automotive. The world's most valuable car company, however, is facing a race against time to avoid a second consecutive year of declining sales.\n\nOther US EV makers have been hit by slowing demand, with GM and Rivian both announcing layoffs in recent months.\n\nChina's overall EV sales were up 19%. While BYD, the country's biggest EV maker, hit a rough patch in its home market amid rising competition from local startups, it set a record for EV exports in October.\n\nGlobally, EV sales were up 21% compared to last year, the Benchmark Mineral Intelligence data showed.\n\n\"Overall, EV demand remains resilient, supported by expanding model ranges and sustained policy incentives worldwide,\" said Charles Lester, data manager for Rho Motion, the Benchmark subsidiary behind the report.",

    "fullText": "The Great Green Wall, officially known as the Three-North Shelter Forest Program (simplified Chinese: 三北防护林; traditional Chinese: 三北防護林; pinyin: Sānběi Fánghùlín), is a series of human-planted windbreaking forest strips (shelterbelts) in China, designed to hold back the expansion of the Gobi Desert[1] and provide timber to the local population.[2] The program started in 1978 and is planned to complete around 2050,[3] at which point it will be expected to have created a vast green barrier spanning approximately 4,828 kilometres (3,000 mi) long and up to 1,448 kilometres (900 mi) wide in certain regions, and will encompass around 88 million acres of forests.[4][5][6]\n\nThe project's name indicates that it is to be carried out in all three northern regions: the North, the Northeast, and the Northwest.[7] This project has historical precedents dating back to before the Common Era. However, in premodern periods, government-sponsored afforestation projects along the historical frontier regions were mostly for military fortification.[8]\n\nChina has the largest desert area of any country and is heavily impacted by sandstorms. However, the country has implemented various measures to restore grasslands and forests, successfully slowing and now reversing overall desertification.[9] In November 2024, China's government reported the completion of the 3,000 km green belt around the Taklamakan Desert. The fraction of the country covered by deserts declined from 27.2% in the previous decade to 26.8%.[10]\n\nInitiated mostly in Northern China, the Great Green Wall of China is a massive reforestation project meant to counteract desertification and slow down the consequences of climate change.[11] Starting in the 1970s in reaction to the Gobi Desert incursion, the project was driven by the Chinese government. Early projects included massive tree planting to stop desertification and safeguard local communities and agricultural territory.[11] Aiming to build a green barrier against desertification, dust storms, and ecological damage,[12] the government started the \"Three-North Shelterbelt Program\" in the 2000s. This effort developed over time into the enormous environmental rehabilitation project known today as the Great Green Wall.\n\nDesertification, which involves either human or natural activity changing normal humid areas to dry desert conditions,[13] is a large and increasing problem faced by modern China. 29.7% of China had been desertified by the year 2000, with the rate of change increasing almost every year.[13] In 2003, Worldchanging reported that 3,600 km2 (1,400 sq mi) of Chinese grassland were being overtaken annually by the Gobi Desert.[14] On June 2001, National Geographic reported that annually, the dust storms blow off as much as 2,000 km2 (800 sq mi) of topsoil, and the storms increase in severity. Such storms have serious agricultural impacts on other nearby countries, including Japan, North Korea, and South Korea.[15] The main cause of these changes was human activity, with water usage, mining, excess farming, and wood cutting being the top contributors.[13] In 2022, Time reported progress in desert stabilization and that thousands of acres of shifting dunes had been stabilized, while the nationwide frequency of sandstorms, including those affecting Beijing, had \"especially\" dropped by one-fifth between 2009 and 2014.[16]\n\nIn 2017, National Geographic reported that the policies in place at the time had contributed to the reduction of China's forests and grasslands. One example was the 'grain first' policy, which required grasslands to be converted into croplands.[11] Reducing grass coverage eliminated one of the barriers to desertification. Most of these causes can be attributed to an underlying issue: population growth.[11] The amount of people living in important ecological areas has grown beyond the carrying capacity of those areas.[17] In 2019, a study published in Nature Sustainability, found that while human activity had previously been associated with land degradation, these policies had led to a net increase in vegetated land in China.[18]\n\nIn the past 40 years, the world as a whole has lost a third of its arable land due to desertification.[17] The increasing desertification and related storms have caused some major issues for people living in China, especially around the Gobi desert. Crops and buildings are being damaged or destroyed. This has forced many people, who are now called \"climate refugees\"[17] to leave their homelands. In total, the effects of desertification have affected the lives of over 400 million people.[17] The Green Wall project was begun in 1978, with the proposed result of raising northern China's forest cover from 5 to 15 percent,[19] thereby reducing desertification.\n\nYin Yuzhen planted trees to rehabilitate the desolate environment in the Uxin Banner of China's semi-arid western landscape. Yin's afforestation efforts have been recognized by individuals such as Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping, who, during the 2020 National People's Congress, described the actions of those such as Yin as a remarkable achievement and an overall improvement of the ecology in China.[20]\n\nChina has been increasingly installing solar farms in its desert regions including Kubuqi Desert as part of efforts to combat desertification. Listed in its renewable energy plan for 2021 to 2025, China has called for the “large-scale development” of its sand-plus-solar anti-desertification method, a strategy that Beijing began promoting around 2023.[21][22] Solar farms in desert areas contribute to China’s renewable energy capacity while also helping to stabilize the landscape. The shade provided by the solar panels reduces the harsh impact of the sun on the soil, creating more favorable conditions for vegetation to grow. In some instances, grass has started to grow beneath the panels, which aids in reducing soil erosion and supporting the local ecosystem.[23]\n\nAdditionally, solar panels have been documented to lower wind speeds at ground level, helping to prevent the movement of sand dunes and minimizing dust that can degrade the environment.[24] This can lead to better air quality and improved conditions for plant growth, further aiding in the restoration of desertified land. In particular, liquorice plants has proven to be effective in the shaded areas beneath solar panels. As a nitrogen-fixing crop, it draws nitrogen from the air, adds organic matter to the soil, and gradually restores soil fertility. Over time, this helps improve the quality of the land, making it suitable for growing a wider variety of crops, such as tomatoes and melons. The more advanced solar farms in Chinese deserts currently feature elevated solar panels that allow for high-tech farming underneath, often in irrigated greenhouses. This approach combines renewable energy production with agricultural practices, contributing to both ecological restoration and food production. Though challenges such as sand buildup on panels and the costs associated with transporting energy from remote areas remain an issue, overall analysis of Landsat data indicates that solar projects have contributed to the greening of deserts in parts of China in recent years.[23][24]\n\nIn 2008, winter storms destroyed 10% of the new forest stock, causing the World Bank to advise China to focus more on quality rather than quantity in its stock species.[25] By 2009, China's planted forest covered more than 500,000 square kilometers (increasing tree cover from 12% to 18%) – the largest artificial forest in the world.[25]\n\nAccording to Foreign Affairs, the Three-North Shelter Forest Program successfully transitioned the economic model of the Gobi Desert region from harmful farming agriculture to ecological-friendly tourism, fruit business, and forestry.[26]\n\nIn 2018, the United States' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found that the increase in forest coverage observed by satellites is consistent with Chinese government data.[27] According to Shixiong Cao, an ecologist at Beijing Forestry University, the Chinese government recognized the water shortages problem in arid regions and changed the approach to plant vegetation with lower water requirements.[27] Zhang Jianlong, head of the forestry department, told the media that the goal was to sustain the health of vegetation and choose suitable plant species and irrigation techniques.[27]\n\nAccording to a 2019 NASA Earth Observatory report, satellite data from 2000 to 2017 showed that China contributed significantly to global greening efforts, primarily through both large-scale afforestation programs and intensive agricultural practices. NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data suggested that China accounted for approximately 25% of the global increase in greening, with about 42% of this growth attributed to both forest conservation and expansion efforts aimed at mitigating soil erosion and climate change.[28]\n\nAccording to a BBC News report in 2020, tree plantation programs resulted in significant carbon dioxide absorption and helped mitigate climate change; the benefit of tree planting was underestimated by previous research.[29] The Three-North Shelter Forest Program was also found to have reversed the desertification of the Gobi Desert, which grew 10,000 square kilometers per year in the 1980s, but was shrinking by more than 2,000 square kilometers per year in 2022.[30]\n\nIn November 2024, China's government reported that after 46 years of work it had finished the 3,000-kilometer green belt around the Taklamakan Desert. The country's forest coverage grew from 10% of the overall territory in 1949 to 25% in 2024; the green belt project contributed to this achievement. Although the country's desert coverage was still 26.8% in 2024, this was down slightly from 27.2% a decade previously.[10]\n\nTo date, at least 30 million hectares of trees have been planted.[31] Moreover, the authorities noted a notable decrease in the frequency and intensity of dust storms, especially in places like Beijing.[12] The tree planting has helped to stabilize the soil and enhance the local microclimates, therefore aiding agriculture and stopping more desertification.[12] Though these achievements are noteworthy, they do not allay the continuous worries regarding the ecological sustainability and efficacy of such massive operations.[32]\n\nHong Jiang, a geography professor at the University of Wisconsin, worried trees could soak up large amounts of groundwater, which would be extremely problematic for arid regions like northern China.[33] Dee Williams, a US Department of Interior anthropologist, pointed to China's past failures in anti-desertification efforts and suggested that planting trees is a temporary fix that could not change behavior.[33]\n\nIn December 2003, American futurist Alex Steffen on his website Worldchanging strongly criticized the Green Wall project. He claimed China wasn't using collaborative effort and information platforms to support the local effort. China's increasing levels of pollution have also weakened the soil, causing it to be unusable in many areas.[14]\n\nResearch of reforested areas of the Loess Plateau has found that the combination of exotic tree species and high-density planting could worsen water shortages. The forests increase the loss of soil moisture content when compared to farmland.[34]\n\nFurthermore, planting blocks of fast-growing trees reduces the biodiversity of forested areas, creating areas unsuitable for plants and animals normally found in forests. \"China plants more trees than the rest of the world combined\", says John MacKinnon, the head of the EU-China Biodiversity Programme, \"but the trouble is they tend to be monoculture plantations. They are not places where birds want to live.\" The lack of diversity also makes the trees more susceptible to disease, as in 2000, when one billion poplar trees in Ningxia were lost to a single disease, setting back 20 years of planting efforts.[35] China's forest scientists argued that monoculture tree plantations are more effective at absorbing the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide than slow-growth forests,[25] so while diversity may be lower, the trees purportedly help to offset China's carbon emissions.\n\nLiu Tuo, head of the Desertification Control Office in the State Forestry Administration, believed that there are huge gaps in the country's efforts to reclaim the land that has become desert.[36] By 2011, around 1.73 million km2 of land had become desert in China, of which 530,000 km2 was treatable. But, at the 2011 rate of treating 1,717 km2 per year, it would take 300 years to reclaim the land that had become desert.[37]\n\nCritics have also questioned the project's efficacy in stopping the Gobi Desert's spread, noting that the severe arid climate and poor soil quality make it challenging to maintain tree development over the long run.[12] Furthermore, although the initiative has made significant progress in reforestation, it has not adequately addressed the fundamental socioeconomic drivers of desertification, including overgrazing and unsustainable farming methods.[32]",

    "fullText": "COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — The United States is using its economic power to “assert its will\" and threaten military force against friend and foe alike, a Danish intelligence agency said in a new report.\n\nThe Danish Defense Intelligence Service, in its latest annual assessment, said Washington's greater assertiveness under the Trump administration also comes as China and Russia seek to diminish Western, especially American, influence.\n\nPerhaps most sensitive to Denmark — a NATO and European Union member country, and a U.S. ally — is growing competition between those great powers in the Arctic. U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed a desire to see Greenland, a semiautonomous and mineral-rich territory of Denmark, become part of the United States, a move opposed by Russia and much of Europe.\n\n“The strategic importance of the Arctic is rising as the conflict between Russia and the West intensifies, and the growing security and strategic focus on the Arctic by the United States will further accelerate these developments,” said the report, published Wednesday.\n\nThe assessment also follows the release last week of a new Trump administration national security strategy that depicts European allies as weak and aims to reassert America’s dominance in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said Russia is worried about NATO’s activities in the Arctic and will respond by strengthening its military capability in the polar region.\n\nThe findings and analyses in the report echo a string of recent concerns, notably in Western Europe, about an increasingly go-it-alone approach by the United States, which under Trump's second term has favored bilateral deals and partnerships at the expense of multilateral alliances like NATO.\n\n“For many countries outside the West, it has become a viable option to forge strategic agreements with China rather than the United States,” read the report, which was written in Danish. “China and Russia, together with other like-minded states, are seeking to reduce Western – and particularly US – global influence.”\n\n“At the same time, uncertainty has grown over how the United States will prioritize its resources in the future,” it added. “This gives regional powers greater room for maneuver, enabling them to choose between the United States and China or to strike a balance between the two.”\n\nThe Trump administration has raised concerns about respect for international law with its series of deadly strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean — part of a stepped-up pressure campaign against President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela.\n\nTrump has also refused to rule out military force in Greenland, where the United States already has a military base.\n\n“The United States is leveraging economic power, including threats of high tariffs, to assert its will, and the possibility of employing military force – even against allies – is no longer ruled out,” the report said.",

    "description": "HD Hyundai built two new guided-missile frigates for the Philippine Navy, giving it a firepower upgrade for South China Sea.",
    "fullText": "One of South Korea's top shipbuilders is turning out new warships for the Philippines as Manila accelerates its naval modernization.\n\nThe new frigates mark a major upgrade for the Philippine fleet, offering the country a more credible defense as China turns up the pressure in the South China Sea.\n\nThe historically obsolete Philippine naval force is now modernizing to meet current and future threats. \"The Philippine Navy is professional and getting stronger,\" Patrick Cronin, the Asia-Pacific security chair at the Hudson Institute, told Business Insider. He said that \"adding two guided-missile frigates to their very small fleet means that China's no longer running alone in the arms competition in the South China Sea.\"\n\nSouth Korean shipbuilder HD Hyundai Heavy Industries has built two HDF-3200 Hybrid frigates for the Philippines. The second vessel, BRP Diego Silang, was commissioned earlier this month, over six months after the first-in-class BRP Miguel Malvar entered service.\n\nBoth vessels bring added firepower to the Philippine Navy. They're the first Philippine warships to have vertical launch systems for missiles, a modern capability that allows the Philippines to carry and fire VL MICA surface-to-air missiles made by MBDA, a European missile company. The frigates also carry eight SSM-700K C-Star anti-ship missiles made by South Korea.\n\nWarship vertical launch systems can be refreshed with new weapons over time. They shoot missiles straight upward before they arc toward their targets, a design that works well in all conditions. Each frigate has 16 cells, allowing the Philippines to tailor its missile loadouts for different missions.\n\nThe $550 million contract for the two frigates dates to 2021 and is the latest in a string of deals between HD Hyundai and Manila. The premier South Korean shipbuilder is also constructing six offshore patrol vessels and has discussed additional projects. In all, it has built 10 ships for the Philippine Navy.\n\n\"As we strengthen our defense industry network with the Philippines and other key Southeast Asian countries, we plan to identify additional potential demand and continuously expand our business competitiveness in the region,\" the company told Business Insider in a statement.\n\nAs Manila races to modernize its military, new warships give its navy much-needed heft in a region where China now fields the world's largest fleet and increasingly throws its weight around.\n\nThe South China Sea has been a hotbed of Chinese aggression, accidents, and close-calls in recent years, with Beijing's navy, coast guard, and maritime militia vessels frequently harassing Philippine fishing boats, spraying them with water cannons, chasing them down, and even ramming into them.\n\nWithin the contested region, the Philippines' new frigates and firepower now pose a potential challenge for China.\n\n\"They would be taking a very big chance of being sunk or knocked out of the sky if they start to push around these frigates,\" Cronin said of China's ships and planes. Strategies on both sides of this long-running dispute will, however, need to be managed carefully to avoid escalation and a shift from gray-zone aggression to conflict.\n\nChina fields a huge coast guard, backed by some of the world’s largest cutters, and typically relies on it for confrontations in the South China Sea while its navy hangs back. In a recent encounter, a Chinese navy destroyer joined in the chase of a Philippine patrol ship. Its unsafe maneuvering at sea led to it slamming into one of China’s own coast guard vessels.\n\n\"It is part of China's standard operating procedure to intentionally engage in unsafe behavior and create risks of collision at sea and in the air,\" Gregory Poling, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Business Insider at the time.\n\nThe Philippines has been investing in other military might to counter China as well.\n\nManila's Archipelagic Defense Concept, for instance, has included the acquisition of more missile systems and better intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance capabilities to monitor its waters. Additionally, more military exercises and deeper cooperation between the Philippines, US, Australia, and other Pacific parnters is also helping better prepare Manila.\n\nThe Philippines is also planning for a fleet of submarines, with another South Korean shipbuilder, Hanwha Ocean, pitching an offer to build diesel-electric submarines earlier this year, as well as construct a submarine base, with support for local maintenance, repair, overhaul, and training.\n\nNewer submarines would provide the Philippine Navy with additional ways to patrol and monitor activity within its waters and deter foes.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 11 - Major automakers on Thursday urged Washington to prevent Chinese government-backed automakers and battery manufacturers from opening U.S. ​manufacturing plants, warning the industry's future is at stake.\n\nThe Alliance for Automotive ‌Innovation, which represents General Motors, Ford, Toyota Motor, Volkswagen, Hyundai, Stellantis and other major automakers, sounded the ‌alarm and said Congress and the Trump administration needed to act.\n\n\"China poses a clear and present threat to the auto industry in the U.S.,\" the group wrote in a statement for a U.S. House hearing on Chinese vehicles. The group also said ⁠lawmakers should maintain the U.S. ‌Commerce Department's prohibition on importing information and communications technology and services from China that effectively bars the import of vehicles from ‍Chinese manufacturers.\n\n\"No amount of investment by automakers and battery manufacturers operating inside the U.S. can counter a China that is enabled by subsidies to chronically oversupply around the world. This is ​a recipe for dumping that Congress and the Trump Administration must prevent ‌from happening inside the U.S.,\" the auto industry group said.\n\nRepresentative John Moolenaar, a Republican who chairs a select House committee on China, said Congress should codify into law the prohibitions on Chinese-connected vehicles that were adopted in the final days of former President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"In just five years, China has gone from a minor ⁠exporter to the world's largest auto exporter, shipping ​6 million vehicles abroad last year at below ​market prices that U.S. and allied automakers cannot match,\" Moolenaar said. \"With massive subsidies, control over raw materials and supply chains and a ‍predatory regulatory regime, Beijing ⁠has turned its auto industry into a tool of the state.\n\nHe also cited national security concerns about Chinese-imported vehicles and concerns that Beijing could ⁠disable vehicles with Chinese-made software or components in the event of a major confrontation.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in ‌Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "Flipping and spinning on a studio floor, 17-year-old Royal is a star in China's breakdancing scene and aiming for gold at the World Championships in Japan this week.\n\nRoyal, real name Guo Pu, shot to fame when she won both the youth and adult Asian Championships in June.\n\nShe is part of a growing Chinese force in breakdancing, which combines acrobatic floor moves, footwork and rhythmic expression to hip-hop or funk and was included as an Olympic sport for the first time at Paris 2024.\n\n\"At first my grandmother would not let me dance breaking because back then, breaking's reputation truly was not very good,\" Royal told AFP at the studio where she trains in her hometown of Pingyi, in the eastern province of Shandong.\n\n\"But after I achieved some results, she stopped saying anything,\" she smiled.\n\nHaving already won the youth world title in August, Royal will compete alongside other \"B-girls\" and \"B-boys\" at the adult World Championships taking place Friday and Saturday in Fukuoka, Japan, the country which has long dominated the sport.\n\n\"I want to win that gold medal for China and show the world that Chinese breaking is getting cooler and cooler,\" she said.\n\nAs a youngster, \"my mother signed me up for all kinds of extracurricular classes, such as playing instruments, then Chinese dance\", Royal said.\n\n\"I also participated in a local children's artistic show for the Chinese New Year. That's when coach Mike saw me.\"\n\nMike, whose real name is Li Shilong, told AFP \"she immediately impressed me\".\n\n\"During her performance I saw a light in her eyes... It was a kind of light that shows a real passion, a real drive for dance and for art.\n\n\"I felt that this girl might have been born for breaking.\"\n\nRoyal has now put school on hold to dedicate her time entirely to dancing.\n\nLike other top athletes in China, she will benefit from easier access to university thanks to her sporting achievements.\n\nRoyal describes herself as \"not very talkative\" and still \"pretty nervous before competitions\", but says she is able to \"open up\" on stage.\n\nIn addition to her Asian and world titles, Royal won gold at this year's World Games -- a top competition for non-Olympic sports.\n\nShe has developed a healthy rivalry with fellow Chinese breakdancer Liu Qingyi, known as \"671\", who won bronze at the Paris Games.\n\nThe country's next generation of breakdancers looks promising, with China winning five out of six medals at the youth World Championships in August.\n\n\"In four years, China has gone from being unknown in the world of breakdancing to ranking among the world's top three and is now seen as the future of breaking,\" Mounir Biba, a 13-time world champion and head coach of the Chinese team, told AFP.\n\n\"There is talent, there is a lot of potential. There are a lot of young dancers in China,\" he said, adding that financial support from the government was helping the sport grow.\n\nHaving breakdancing in the Olympics has encouraged the surge of interest in China, according to coach Mike.\n\n\"Once a discipline is officially recognised as a sport in China it's developed very intensively,\" he said.\n\nAuthorities see an opportunity to win international honours while parents, reassured by breakdancing's new respectability, are more willing to let their children practise it.\n\nThe Chinese DanceSport Federation now organises numerous competitions, Mike said, while funds are allocated to training facilities.\n\nThe only downside, according to the coach, is that some Chinese dancers do not necessarily fully understand the culture of breakdancing, which originated in New York in the 1970s.\n\n\"The (skill) difficulty level in China is exceptionally high. However, the understanding of dance and the depth of exploration into dance artistry remains insufficient,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"This is an area where we need to learn from Western nations,\" Mike said.\n\n\"Breakdancing, and other street dance styles... their essence is innovation. I believe that by understanding the core of this culture, Chinese children will become more creative.\"\n\nRoyal is keen to push the sport's creativity.\n\n\"I really want to inspire the next generation of B-girls,\" she said.\n\n\"By passing on the history and the culture of breaking, and developing a style of breaking that's unique to girls.\"",

    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nChina continues to make big advances in the final frontier.\n\nThe nation just launched three Long March rockets in less than 19 hours, setting a new national mark for liftoff cadence.\n\nIn addition, the trio pushed China's orbital-launch tally for 2025 to 83, extending another record. The previous yearly high for the country, set last year, was 68. (Eighty-three is not a global record, however; SpaceX has launched 159 orbital missions in 2025 so far by itself.)\n\nThe flurry began Monday (Dec. 8) at 5:11 p.m. EST (2211 GMT), when a Long March 6A rocket lifted off from Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in northern China. That mission successfully sent a batch of broadband satellites to low Earth orbit for the Guowang (\"national network\") megaconstellation.\n\nThen, at 10:41 p.m. EST on Monday (0341 GMT on Tuesday, Dec. 9), the mysterious Yaogan 47 spacecraft took flight atop a Long March 4B from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert. Yaogan 47 is a classified satellite that will be used by the Chinese military.\n\nThe tripleheader wrapped up on Tuesday at 10:08 a.m. EST (1508 GMT) with the launch of another classified satellite, known as TJSW-22, on a Long March 3B from Xichang Satellite Launch Center in western China.\n\nAll three of these launches took place on Tuesday Beijing time, as noted by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), the state-owned entity that operates the Long March family of rockets.\n\n\"This was the third successful launch of China's Long March rockets today, setting a new record of three launches in one day,\" CASC officials said in a statement on Tuesday, referring to the TJSW-22 liftoff (in Mandarin; translation by Google).\n\nA total of five orbital launches have now occurred in the 24-hour stretch beginning with Monday's Guowang liftoff. The other two were SpaceX Falcon 9 missions — a Monday evening flight lofted a batch of the company's Starlink satellites and the NROL-77 launch for the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office happened on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThat's not a 24-hour record, however: Between April 28-29 of this year, six different rockets launched toward orbit in a span of just 18 hours — a Long March 5B, two Falcon 9s, a United Launch Alliance Atlas V, an Arianespace Vega C and Alpha, a vehicle built and operated by Texas-based company Firefly Aerospace. All but Alpha were successful.",

    "fullText": "Dec 9 (Reuters) - Beijing is set to limit access to Nvidia's advanced H200 chips despite U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to allow the ​export of the technology to China, the Financial Times reported on ‌Tuesday, citing two people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nRegulators in Beijing have been discussing ways to ‌permit limited access to the H200, Nvidia's second-best generation of artificial intelligence chips, according to the report.\n\nSuch a move would add a hurdle to Nvidia and other top U.S. chipmakers' ability to address the China market, after Trump's Monday announcement appeared ⁠to settle a debate over ‌whether these companies should keep their global lead by selling AI chips to China or withhold shipments.\n\nNvidia shares, which had risen ‍as much as 2% in premarket trading, pared gains after the report and were last up about 0.6%. The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for ​comment on the report.\n\nBeijing has been pushing back against domestic firms' use of ‌U.S. technology, especially Nvidia chips, as it retaliates against American restrictions.\n\nEarlier U.S. restrictions banned the sale of advanced AI processors to China, weighing on Nvidia's ability to grow in one of the world's largest markets for AI chips and development.\n\nThe export of the H200 chips will be permitted with a 25% fee levied ⁠on such sales, Trump said in a ​post on Truth Social on Monday.\n\nIpek Ozkardeskaya, senior ​analyst at Swissquote Bank, said the approval alone may have limited impact on Nvidia's business in China unless it is allowed to ‍export other chip ⁠lines such as Blackwell or Rubin.\n\nShares of AMD and Intel also pared gains and were last up about 0.3% in premarket trading. So far ⁠this year, Nvidia has gained nearly 40% compared with the S&P 500 benchmark index's 16.4% rise ‌in the same period.",

    "fullText": "Dec 10 - Chinese rare-earth magnet suppliers to U.S. automaker Ford Motor were included in the first batch of new ​export licences issued by Beijing to boost shipments and reduce shortages of ‌the vital components, the carmaker said on Wednesday.\n\nThe so-called general licences were agreed after Presidents Xi Jinping ‌and Donald Trump met in South Korea and will reportedly allow larger shipments with fewer hurdles under year-long permits for individual customers.\n\nChina’s introduction of rare-earth export controls in April forced companies to apply for licences for every shipment, creating shortages that brought parts of ⁠the auto supply chain to ‌a halt and handed Beijing enormous leverage in trade talks with Washington.\n\nChina has said little publicly about the new licences, how they ​will work or who will receive them, raising fears among non-U.S. diplomats and ‌producers that the licences will be for U.S. customers primarily.\n\nThose concerns were heightened this week when Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said that the country's automakers were not included in this first round. Many of those manufacturers, such as Volkswagen, have had ties with China for many years.\n\nWadephul said that \"quite a lot of work\" was still ⁠needed to persuade Beijing to grant the new ​licences to German companies.\n\nWhile the system agreed between ​Xi and Trump should accelerate exports for some customers, it remains to be seen how widely Beijing will issue licences and whether customers ‍in more sensitive sectors ⁠such as aerospace or semiconductors will qualify. China's rare-earth exports jumped in November.\n\n\"While we are pleased that some of our suppliers have secured these approvals, we ⁠urge the U.S. and Chinese governments to continue their collaboration to fully resolve supply chain issues,\" ‌Ford said in its statement to Reuters.",
