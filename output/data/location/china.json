    "description": "The United States tops the remaining areas in an assessment of 74 technologies.",
    "fullText": "China is leading research in nearly 90% of the crucial technologies that “significantly enhance, or pose risks to, a country’s national interests”, according to a technology tracker run by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) — an independent think-tank.\n\nThe ASPI’s Critical Technology Tracker evaluated research on 74 current and emerging technologies this year, up from the 64 technologies it analyzed last year. China is ranked number one for research on 66 of the technologies, including nuclear energy, synthetic biology, small satellites, while the United States topped the remaining 8, including quantum computing and geoengineering.\n\nThe results reflect a drastic reversal. At the beginning of this century, the United States led more than 90% of the assessed technologies, whereas China led less than 5% of them, according to the 2024 edition of the tracker.\n\n“China has made incredible progress on science and technology that is reflected in research and development, as well as in publications,” says Ilaria Mazzocco, who researches China’s industrial policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a non-profit research organization based in Washington DC.\n\nMazzocco says the general trend identified by the ASPI is not a surprise, but it is “remarkable” to see that China is so dominant and advanced in so many fields compared with the United States.\n\nThis might have something to do with the type of technologies that are tracked, says Wang Yanbo, a science-policy researcher at the University of Hong Kong. The country is more likely to be a research leader in new technologies, where it has focused its efforts, compared to traditional fields where other country's lead, such as semi conductor chips, he notes.\n\nThe ASPI team based its analysis on a database that contains more than nine million publications from all around the world. It ranked nations in each technology by identifying the top 10% of the most-cited papers produced by researchers in a country over a five-year period, between 2020 and 2024, and calculated that country's global share.\n\nOne noteworthy finding is that China is outpacing the United States in cloud and edge computing, according to David Lin, a national security and technology strategist at the Special Competitive Studies Project, a non-profit organization based in Arlington, Virginia. Cloud computing enables artificial intelligence (AI) companies to train models and process data without the need for physical infrastructure, whereas edge computing processes data locally. China’s research intensity in these fields “probably reflects the urgency with which Beijing is moving AI from the lab into deployment”, Lin says.\n\nThe analysis should not be interpreted as “a collapse of American power”, says Steven Hai, a political economist focusing on technology innovation at Xi’an Jiaotong–Liverpool University in Suzhou, China. In general, the United States is still an important player globally in these technologies, Hai says.\n\nJenny Wong-Leung, a data scientist at ASPI who participated in the study, warns that the findings show democratic nations risk losing “hard-won, long-term advantages in cutting-edge science and research” in a range of essential sectors, which is the crucial for the development and advancement of the world’s most important technologies.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-04048-7\n\nGrowing cities face mounting challenges\n\nChina accounts for more than half of leading output in the applied sciences\n\nGeothermal networks let cities warm and cool as one\n\nWill young universities set the pace in the age of AI?\n\nWhat would an AI university look like and how might it change education?\n\nChina is leading the world on AI governance: other countries must engage\n\nAustralia’s world-first social media ban is a ‘natural experiment’ for scientists\n\nChina is leading the world on AI governance: other countries must engage\n\nThe top US health director who stood up for science — and was fired\n\nJoin HZAU's global faculty team to advance research with competitive benefits.\n\nNo.1 Shizishan Street, Hongshan District, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China\n\nHuazhong Agricultural University (HZAU)\n\nChair Professors / Professors / Associate Professors / Assistant Professors\n\nGreat Bay University, China (GBU)\n\nseeking outstanding, innovative tenured/tenure-track Principal Investigators to establish independent research programs\n\nExceptional young scholars worldwide with strong research achievements in relevant fields\n\nInstitute of Nanotechnology and Intelligence (inAI), Jinan University, China.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — Chinese demand for foreign luxury cars is waning as customers opt for more affordable Chinese brand models, often sold at big discounts, catering to their taste for fancy electronics and comfort.\n\nThat is bad news for European carmakers like Porsche, Aston Martin, Mercedes-Benz and BMW that have long dominated the upper reaches of the world's largest auto market.\n\nA slowing economy hits the luxury market\n\nA prolonged property downturn in China has left many consumers with little appetite for big purchases. Meanwhile, the well-to-do are becoming increasingly shy about publicly displaying their wealth, said Paul Gong, UBS head of China Automotive Industry Research.\n\nMany car buyers have been swayed by a 20,000 yuan ($2,830) trade-in subsidy offered by the Chinese government for purchasing electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. People tended to purchase cheaper, entry-level cars where the discount will count more and those cars are mostly Chinese made, Gong said.\n\n“Slowing economic growth is one key driver behind weaker demand for premium cars,” said Claire Yuan, director of corporate ratings for China autos at S&P Global Ratings, referring to a segment that typically counts car brands such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW.\n\nThe market share of premium car sales in China, usually priced above 300,000 yuan ($42,400), more than doubled between 2017 and 2023 to about 15% of total sales, S&P said.\n\nThat trend is now reversing. The share of premium cars sales fell to 14% in 2024 and to 13% in the first nine months of 2025, S&P said.\n\nChinese automakers take a bigger bite\n\nWhile luxury auto sales have slowed, Chinese manufacturers, including electric vehicle maker BYD, have become more aggressive than many Western brands in technological innovation, frequently rolling out new electric vehicles and hybrids at cheaper prices, including premium vehicles, analysts said.\n\n“Their (Chinese carmakers’) products are more competitive and more affordable even in the premium segment,” Yuan said. “That’s why these foreign brands are gradually losing momentum.”\n\nThe Chinese brands’ share of passenger car sales climbed to almost 70% in the first 11 months of this year, according to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. It reported Thursday that German brands held a 12% share, Japanese brands around 10% and U.S. brands nearly 6%.\n\nBYD already has overtaken Volkswagen as the biggest car seller in China in recent years. BYD is so far the best selling car brand this year in China for “new energy vehicles,” which include electric vehicles and hybrids, according to the China Passenger Car Association. BYD had cut prices of its electric and plug-in hybrid models by up to 34%, putting pressure on major rivals like Geely and Leapmotor.",

    "fullText": "The Great Green Wall, officially known as the Three-North Shelter Forest Program (simplified Chinese: 三北防护林; traditional Chinese: 三北防護林; pinyin: Sānběi Fánghùlín), is a series of human-planted windbreaking forest strips (shelterbelts) in China, designed to hold back the expansion of the Gobi Desert[1] and provide timber to the local population.[2] The program started in 1978 and is planned to complete around 2050,[3] at which point it will be expected to have created a vast green barrier spanning approximately 4,828 kilometres (3,000 mi) long and up to 1,448 kilometres (900 mi) wide in certain regions, and will encompass around 88 million acres of forests.[4][5][6]\n\nThe project's name indicates that it is to be carried out in all three northern regions: the North, the Northeast, and the Northwest.[7] This project has historical precedents dating back to before the Common Era. However, in premodern periods, government-sponsored afforestation projects along the historical frontier regions were mostly for military fortification.[8]\n\nChina has the largest desert area of any country and is heavily impacted by sandstorms. However, the country has implemented various measures to restore grasslands and forests, successfully slowing and now reversing overall desertification.[9] In November 2024, China's government reported the completion of the 3,000 km green belt around the Taklamakan Desert. The fraction of the country covered by deserts declined from 27.2% in the previous decade to 26.8%.[10]\n\nInitiated mostly in Northern China, the Great Green Wall of China is a massive reforestation project meant to counteract desertification and slow down the consequences of climate change.[11] Starting in the 1970s in reaction to the Gobi Desert incursion, the project was driven by the Chinese government. Early projects included massive tree planting to stop desertification and safeguard local communities and agricultural territory.[11] Aiming to build a green barrier against desertification, dust storms, and ecological damage,[12] the government started the \"Three-North Shelterbelt Program\" in the 2000s. This effort developed over time into the enormous environmental rehabilitation project known today as the Great Green Wall.\n\nDesertification, which involves either human or natural activity changing normal humid areas to dry desert conditions,[13] is a large and increasing problem faced by modern China. 29.7% of China had been desertified by the year 2000, with the rate of change increasing almost every year.[13] In 2003, Worldchanging reported that 3,600 km2 (1,400 sq mi) of Chinese grassland were being overtaken annually by the Gobi Desert.[14] On June 2001, National Geographic reported that annually, the dust storms blow off as much as 2,000 km2 (800 sq mi) of topsoil, and the storms increase in severity. Such storms have serious agricultural impacts on other nearby countries, including Japan, North Korea, and South Korea.[15] The main cause of these changes was human activity, with water usage, mining, excess farming, and wood cutting being the top contributors.[13] In 2022, Time reported progress in desert stabilization and that thousands of acres of shifting dunes had been stabilized, while the nationwide frequency of sandstorms, including those affecting Beijing, had \"especially\" dropped by one-fifth between 2009 and 2014.[16]\n\nIn 2017, National Geographic reported that the policies in place at the time had contributed to the reduction of China's forests and grasslands. One example was the 'grain first' policy, which required grasslands to be converted into croplands.[11] Reducing grass coverage eliminated one of the barriers to desertification. Most of these causes can be attributed to an underlying issue: population growth.[11] The amount of people living in important ecological areas has grown beyond the carrying capacity of those areas.[17] In 2019, a study published in Nature Sustainability, found that while human activity had previously been associated with land degradation, these policies had led to a net increase in vegetated land in China.[18]\n\nIn the past 40 years, the world as a whole has lost a third of its arable land due to desertification.[17] The increasing desertification and related storms have caused some major issues for people living in China, especially around the Gobi desert. Crops and buildings are being damaged or destroyed. This has forced many people, who are now called \"climate refugees\"[17] to leave their homelands. In total, the effects of desertification have affected the lives of over 400 million people.[17] The Green Wall project was begun in 1978, with the proposed result of raising northern China's forest cover from 5 to 15 percent,[19] thereby reducing desertification.\n\nYin Yuzhen planted trees to rehabilitate the desolate environment in the Uxin Banner of China's semi-arid western landscape. Yin's afforestation efforts have been recognized by individuals such as Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping, who, during the 2020 National People's Congress, described the actions of those such as Yin as a remarkable achievement and an overall improvement of the ecology in China.[20]\n\nChina has been increasingly installing solar farms in its desert regions including Kubuqi Desert as part of efforts to combat desertification. Listed in its renewable energy plan for 2021 to 2025, China has called for the “large-scale development” of its sand-plus-solar anti-desertification method, a strategy that Beijing began promoting around 2023.[21][22] Solar farms in desert areas contribute to China’s renewable energy capacity while also helping to stabilize the landscape. The shade provided by the solar panels reduces the harsh impact of the sun on the soil, creating more favorable conditions for vegetation to grow. In some instances, grass has started to grow beneath the panels, which aids in reducing soil erosion and supporting the local ecosystem.[23]\n\nAdditionally, solar panels have been documented to lower wind speeds at ground level, helping to prevent the movement of sand dunes and minimizing dust that can degrade the environment.[24] This can lead to better air quality and improved conditions for plant growth, further aiding in the restoration of desertified land. In particular, liquorice plants has proven to be effective in the shaded areas beneath solar panels. As a nitrogen-fixing crop, it draws nitrogen from the air, adds organic matter to the soil, and gradually restores soil fertility. Over time, this helps improve the quality of the land, making it suitable for growing a wider variety of crops, such as tomatoes and melons. The more advanced solar farms in Chinese deserts currently feature elevated solar panels that allow for high-tech farming underneath, often in irrigated greenhouses. This approach combines renewable energy production with agricultural practices, contributing to both ecological restoration and food production. Though challenges such as sand buildup on panels and the costs associated with transporting energy from remote areas remain an issue, overall analysis of Landsat data indicates that solar projects have contributed to the greening of deserts in parts of China in recent years.[23][24]\n\nIn 2008, winter storms destroyed 10% of the new forest stock, causing the World Bank to advise China to focus more on quality rather than quantity in its stock species.[25] By 2009, China's planted forest covered more than 500,000 square kilometers (increasing tree cover from 12% to 18%) – the largest artificial forest in the world.[25]\n\nAccording to Foreign Affairs, the Three-North Shelter Forest Program successfully transitioned the economic model of the Gobi Desert region from harmful farming agriculture to ecological-friendly tourism, fruit business, and forestry.[26]\n\nIn 2018, the United States' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found that the increase in forest coverage observed by satellites is consistent with Chinese government data.[27] According to Shixiong Cao, an ecologist at Beijing Forestry University, the Chinese government recognized the water shortages problem in arid regions and changed the approach to plant vegetation with lower water requirements.[27] Zhang Jianlong, head of the forestry department, told the media that the goal was to sustain the health of vegetation and choose suitable plant species and irrigation techniques.[27]\n\nAccording to a 2019 NASA Earth Observatory report, satellite data from 2000 to 2017 showed that China contributed significantly to global greening efforts, primarily through both large-scale afforestation programs and intensive agricultural practices. NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data suggested that China accounted for approximately 25% of the global increase in greening, with about 42% of this growth attributed to both forest conservation and expansion efforts aimed at mitigating soil erosion and climate change.[28]\n\nAccording to a BBC News report in 2020, tree plantation programs resulted in significant carbon dioxide absorption and helped mitigate climate change; the benefit of tree planting was underestimated by previous research.[29] The Three-North Shelter Forest Program was also found to have reversed the desertification of the Gobi Desert, which grew 10,000 square kilometers per year in the 1980s, but was shrinking by more than 2,000 square kilometers per year in 2022.[30]\n\nIn November 2024, China's government reported that after 46 years of work it had finished the 3,000-kilometer green belt around the Taklamakan Desert. The country's forest coverage grew from 10% of the overall territory in 1949 to 25% in 2024; the green belt project contributed to this achievement. Although the country's desert coverage was still 26.8% in 2024, this was down slightly from 27.2% a decade previously.[10]\n\nTo date, at least 30 million hectares of trees have been planted.[31] Moreover, the authorities noted a notable decrease in the frequency and intensity of dust storms, especially in places like Beijing.[12] The tree planting has helped to stabilize the soil and enhance the local microclimates, therefore aiding agriculture and stopping more desertification.[12] Though these achievements are noteworthy, they do not allay the continuous worries regarding the ecological sustainability and efficacy of such massive operations.[32]\n\nHong Jiang, a geography professor at the University of Wisconsin, worried trees could soak up large amounts of groundwater, which would be extremely problematic for arid regions like northern China.[33] Dee Williams, a US Department of Interior anthropologist, pointed to China's past failures in anti-desertification efforts and suggested that planting trees is a temporary fix that could not change behavior.[33]\n\nIn December 2003, American futurist Alex Steffen on his website Worldchanging strongly criticized the Green Wall project. He claimed China wasn't using collaborative effort and information platforms to support the local effort. China's increasing levels of pollution have also weakened the soil, causing it to be unusable in many areas.[14]\n\nResearch of reforested areas of the Loess Plateau has found that the combination of exotic tree species and high-density planting could worsen water shortages. The forests increase the loss of soil moisture content when compared to farmland.[34]\n\nFurthermore, planting blocks of fast-growing trees reduces the biodiversity of forested areas, creating areas unsuitable for plants and animals normally found in forests. \"China plants more trees than the rest of the world combined\", says John MacKinnon, the head of the EU-China Biodiversity Programme, \"but the trouble is they tend to be monoculture plantations. They are not places where birds want to live.\" The lack of diversity also makes the trees more susceptible to disease, as in 2000, when one billion poplar trees in Ningxia were lost to a single disease, setting back 20 years of planting efforts.[35] China's forest scientists argued that monoculture tree plantations are more effective at absorbing the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide than slow-growth forests,[25] so while diversity may be lower, the trees purportedly help to offset China's carbon emissions.\n\nLiu Tuo, head of the Desertification Control Office in the State Forestry Administration, believed that there are huge gaps in the country's efforts to reclaim the land that has become desert.[36] By 2011, around 1.73 million km2 of land had become desert in China, of which 530,000 km2 was treatable. But, at the 2011 rate of treating 1,717 km2 per year, it would take 300 years to reclaim the land that had become desert.[37]\n\nCritics have also questioned the project's efficacy in stopping the Gobi Desert's spread, noting that the severe arid climate and poor soil quality make it challenging to maintain tree development over the long run.[12] Furthermore, although the initiative has made significant progress in reforestation, it has not adequately addressed the fundamental socioeconomic drivers of desertification, including overgrazing and unsustainable farming methods.[32]",

    "fullText": "COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — The United States is using its economic power to “assert its will\" and threaten military force against friend and foe alike, a Danish intelligence agency said in a new report.\n\nThe Danish Defense Intelligence Service, in its latest annual assessment, said Washington's greater assertiveness under the Trump administration also comes as China and Russia seek to diminish Western, especially American, influence.\n\nPerhaps most sensitive to Denmark — a NATO and European Union member country, and a U.S. ally — is growing competition between those great powers in the Arctic. U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed a desire to see Greenland, a semiautonomous and mineral-rich territory of Denmark, become part of the United States, a move opposed by Russia and much of Europe.\n\n“The strategic importance of the Arctic is rising as the conflict between Russia and the West intensifies, and the growing security and strategic focus on the Arctic by the United States will further accelerate these developments,” said the report, published Wednesday.\n\nThe assessment also follows the release last week of a new Trump administration national security strategy that depicts European allies as weak and aims to reassert America’s dominance in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said Russia is worried about NATO’s activities in the Arctic and will respond by strengthening its military capability in the polar region.\n\nThe findings and analyses in the report echo a string of recent concerns, notably in Western Europe, about an increasingly go-it-alone approach by the United States, which under Trump's second term has favored bilateral deals and partnerships at the expense of multilateral alliances like NATO.\n\n“For many countries outside the West, it has become a viable option to forge strategic agreements with China rather than the United States,” read the report, which was written in Danish. “China and Russia, together with other like-minded states, are seeking to reduce Western – and particularly US – global influence.”\n\n“At the same time, uncertainty has grown over how the United States will prioritize its resources in the future,” it added. “This gives regional powers greater room for maneuver, enabling them to choose between the United States and China or to strike a balance between the two.”\n\nThe Trump administration has raised concerns about respect for international law with its series of deadly strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean — part of a stepped-up pressure campaign against President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela.\n\nTrump has also refused to rule out military force in Greenland, where the United States already has a military base.\n\n“The United States is leveraging economic power, including threats of high tariffs, to assert its will, and the possibility of employing military force – even against allies – is no longer ruled out,” the report said.",

    "description": "HD Hyundai built two new guided-missile frigates for the Philippine Navy, giving it a firepower upgrade for South China Sea.",
    "fullText": "One of South Korea's top shipbuilders is turning out new warships for the Philippines as Manila accelerates its naval modernization.\n\nThe new frigates mark a major upgrade for the Philippine fleet, offering the country a more credible defense as China turns up the pressure in the South China Sea.\n\nThe historically obsolete Philippine naval force is now modernizing to meet current and future threats. \"The Philippine Navy is professional and getting stronger,\" Patrick Cronin, the Asia-Pacific security chair at the Hudson Institute, told Business Insider. He said that \"adding two guided-missile frigates to their very small fleet means that China's no longer running alone in the arms competition in the South China Sea.\"\n\nSouth Korean shipbuilder HD Hyundai Heavy Industries has built two HDF-3200 Hybrid frigates for the Philippines. The second vessel, BRP Diego Silang, was commissioned earlier this month, over six months after the first-in-class BRP Miguel Malvar entered service.\n\nBoth vessels bring added firepower to the Philippine Navy. They're the first Philippine warships to have vertical launch systems for missiles, a modern capability that allows the Philippines to carry and fire VL MICA surface-to-air missiles made by MBDA, a European missile company. The frigates also carry eight SSM-700K C-Star anti-ship missiles made by South Korea.\n\nWarship vertical launch systems can be refreshed with new weapons over time. They shoot missiles straight upward before they arc toward their targets, a design that works well in all conditions. Each frigate has 16 cells, allowing the Philippines to tailor its missile loadouts for different missions.\n\nThe $550 million contract for the two frigates dates to 2021 and is the latest in a string of deals between HD Hyundai and Manila. The premier South Korean shipbuilder is also constructing six offshore patrol vessels and has discussed additional projects. In all, it has built 10 ships for the Philippine Navy.\n\n\"As we strengthen our defense industry network with the Philippines and other key Southeast Asian countries, we plan to identify additional potential demand and continuously expand our business competitiveness in the region,\" the company told Business Insider in a statement.\n\nAs Manila races to modernize its military, new warships give its navy much-needed heft in a region where China now fields the world's largest fleet and increasingly throws its weight around.\n\nThe South China Sea has been a hotbed of Chinese aggression, accidents, and close-calls in recent years, with Beijing's navy, coast guard, and maritime militia vessels frequently harassing Philippine fishing boats, spraying them with water cannons, chasing them down, and even ramming into them.\n\nWithin the contested region, the Philippines' new frigates and firepower now pose a potential challenge for China.\n\n\"They would be taking a very big chance of being sunk or knocked out of the sky if they start to push around these frigates,\" Cronin said of China's ships and planes. Strategies on both sides of this long-running dispute will, however, need to be managed carefully to avoid escalation and a shift from gray-zone aggression to conflict.\n\nChina fields a huge coast guard, backed by some of the world’s largest cutters, and typically relies on it for confrontations in the South China Sea while its navy hangs back. In a recent encounter, a Chinese navy destroyer joined in the chase of a Philippine patrol ship. Its unsafe maneuvering at sea led to it slamming into one of China’s own coast guard vessels.\n\n\"It is part of China's standard operating procedure to intentionally engage in unsafe behavior and create risks of collision at sea and in the air,\" Gregory Poling, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Business Insider at the time.\n\nThe Philippines has been investing in other military might to counter China as well.\n\nManila's Archipelagic Defense Concept, for instance, has included the acquisition of more missile systems and better intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance capabilities to monitor its waters. Additionally, more military exercises and deeper cooperation between the Philippines, US, Australia, and other Pacific parnters is also helping better prepare Manila.\n\nThe Philippines is also planning for a fleet of submarines, with another South Korean shipbuilder, Hanwha Ocean, pitching an offer to build diesel-electric submarines earlier this year, as well as construct a submarine base, with support for local maintenance, repair, overhaul, and training.\n\nNewer submarines would provide the Philippine Navy with additional ways to patrol and monitor activity within its waters and deter foes.",

    "fullText": "Flipping and spinning on a studio floor, 17-year-old Royal is a star in China's breakdancing scene and aiming for gold at the World Championships in Japan this week.\n\nRoyal, real name Guo Pu, shot to fame when she won both the youth and adult Asian Championships in June.\n\nShe is part of a growing Chinese force in breakdancing, which combines acrobatic floor moves, footwork and rhythmic expression to hip-hop or funk and was included as an Olympic sport for the first time at Paris 2024.\n\n\"At first my grandmother would not let me dance breaking because back then, breaking's reputation truly was not very good,\" Royal told AFP at the studio where she trains in her hometown of Pingyi, in the eastern province of Shandong.\n\n\"But after I achieved some results, she stopped saying anything,\" she smiled.\n\nHaving already won the youth world title in August, Royal will compete alongside other \"B-girls\" and \"B-boys\" at the adult World Championships taking place Friday and Saturday in Fukuoka, Japan, the country which has long dominated the sport.\n\n\"I want to win that gold medal for China and show the world that Chinese breaking is getting cooler and cooler,\" she said.\n\nAs a youngster, \"my mother signed me up for all kinds of extracurricular classes, such as playing instruments, then Chinese dance\", Royal said.\n\n\"I also participated in a local children's artistic show for the Chinese New Year. That's when coach Mike saw me.\"\n\nMike, whose real name is Li Shilong, told AFP \"she immediately impressed me\".\n\n\"During her performance I saw a light in her eyes... It was a kind of light that shows a real passion, a real drive for dance and for art.\n\n\"I felt that this girl might have been born for breaking.\"\n\nRoyal has now put school on hold to dedicate her time entirely to dancing.\n\nLike other top athletes in China, she will benefit from easier access to university thanks to her sporting achievements.\n\nRoyal describes herself as \"not very talkative\" and still \"pretty nervous before competitions\", but says she is able to \"open up\" on stage.\n\nIn addition to her Asian and world titles, Royal won gold at this year's World Games -- a top competition for non-Olympic sports.\n\nShe has developed a healthy rivalry with fellow Chinese breakdancer Liu Qingyi, known as \"671\", who won bronze at the Paris Games.\n\nThe country's next generation of breakdancers looks promising, with China winning five out of six medals at the youth World Championships in August.\n\n\"In four years, China has gone from being unknown in the world of breakdancing to ranking among the world's top three and is now seen as the future of breaking,\" Mounir Biba, a 13-time world champion and head coach of the Chinese team, told AFP.\n\n\"There is talent, there is a lot of potential. There are a lot of young dancers in China,\" he said, adding that financial support from the government was helping the sport grow.\n\nHaving breakdancing in the Olympics has encouraged the surge of interest in China, according to coach Mike.\n\n\"Once a discipline is officially recognised as a sport in China it's developed very intensively,\" he said.\n\nAuthorities see an opportunity to win international honours while parents, reassured by breakdancing's new respectability, are more willing to let their children practise it.\n\nThe Chinese DanceSport Federation now organises numerous competitions, Mike said, while funds are allocated to training facilities.\n\nThe only downside, according to the coach, is that some Chinese dancers do not necessarily fully understand the culture of breakdancing, which originated in New York in the 1970s.\n\n\"The (skill) difficulty level in China is exceptionally high. However, the understanding of dance and the depth of exploration into dance artistry remains insufficient,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"This is an area where we need to learn from Western nations,\" Mike said.\n\n\"Breakdancing, and other street dance styles... their essence is innovation. I believe that by understanding the core of this culture, Chinese children will become more creative.\"\n\nRoyal is keen to push the sport's creativity.\n\n\"I really want to inspire the next generation of B-girls,\" she said.\n\n\"By passing on the history and the culture of breaking, and developing a style of breaking that's unique to girls.\"",

    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nChina continues to make big advances in the final frontier.\n\nThe nation just launched three Long March rockets in less than 19 hours, setting a new national mark for liftoff cadence.\n\nIn addition, the trio pushed China's orbital-launch tally for 2025 to 83, extending another record. The previous yearly high for the country, set last year, was 68. (Eighty-three is not a global record, however; SpaceX has launched 159 orbital missions in 2025 so far by itself.)\n\nThe flurry began Monday (Dec. 8) at 5:11 p.m. EST (2211 GMT), when a Long March 6A rocket lifted off from Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in northern China. That mission successfully sent a batch of broadband satellites to low Earth orbit for the Guowang (\"national network\") megaconstellation.\n\nThen, at 10:41 p.m. EST on Monday (0341 GMT on Tuesday, Dec. 9), the mysterious Yaogan 47 spacecraft took flight atop a Long March 4B from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert. Yaogan 47 is a classified satellite that will be used by the Chinese military.\n\nThe tripleheader wrapped up on Tuesday at 10:08 a.m. EST (1508 GMT) with the launch of another classified satellite, known as TJSW-22, on a Long March 3B from Xichang Satellite Launch Center in western China.\n\nAll three of these launches took place on Tuesday Beijing time, as noted by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), the state-owned entity that operates the Long March family of rockets.\n\n\"This was the third successful launch of China's Long March rockets today, setting a new record of three launches in one day,\" CASC officials said in a statement on Tuesday, referring to the TJSW-22 liftoff (in Mandarin; translation by Google).\n\nA total of five orbital launches have now occurred in the 24-hour stretch beginning with Monday's Guowang liftoff. The other two were SpaceX Falcon 9 missions — a Monday evening flight lofted a batch of the company's Starlink satellites and the NROL-77 launch for the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office happened on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThat's not a 24-hour record, however: Between April 28-29 of this year, six different rockets launched toward orbit in a span of just 18 hours — a Long March 5B, two Falcon 9s, a United Launch Alliance Atlas V, an Arianespace Vega C and Alpha, a vehicle built and operated by Texas-based company Firefly Aerospace. All but Alpha were successful.",

The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for ​comment on the report.\n\nBeijing has been pushing back against domestic firms' use of ‌U.S. technology, especially Nvidia chips, as it retaliates against American restrictions.\n\nEarlier U.S. restrictions banned the sale of advanced AI processors to China, weighing on Nvidia's ability to grow in one of the world's largest markets for AI chips and development.\n\nThe export of the H200 chips will be permitted with a 25% fee levied ⁠on such sales, Trump said in a ​post on Truth Social on Monday.\n\nIpek Ozkardeskaya, senior ​analyst at Swissquote Bank, said the approval alone may have limited impact on Nvidia's business in China unless it is allowed to ‍export other chip ⁠lines such as Blackwell or Rubin.\n\nShares of AMD and Intel also pared gains and were last up about 0.3% in premarket trading.

Many of those manufacturers, such as Volkswagen, have had ties with China for many years.\n\nWadephul said that \"quite a lot of work\" was still ⁠needed to persuade Beijing to grant the new ​licences to German companies.\n\nWhile the system agreed between ​Xi and Trump should accelerate exports for some customers, it remains to be seen how widely Beijing will issue licences and whether customers ‍in more sensitive sectors ⁠such as aerospace or semiconductors will qualify.

And by far, there's the most choice in China.\"\n\nHe said that for consumers interested in EVs, there were \"well under five great choices\" at a price point close to the average price of a new car in the US.\n\nHe added that, within a price range of $50,000, there was only one compelling choice of EV: a Tesla. In October, Tesla unveiled its most affordable models to date: the $36,990 Model 3 Standard and the $39,990 Model Y Standard.\n\n\"And that's not a reflection of a healthy market with lots of choice,\" Scaringe said. \"If you think of it as a consumer, you have 300 different internal combustion engine choices at that price or lower, and you have maybe one highly compelling EV choice.\"\n\nRivian is working to provide cheaper EV alternatives. It is gearing up to start production on its cheapest EV to date, the R2 model, a $45,000 SUV.\n\nIn the interview, Scaringe also said he agrees with the Trump administration's push to bring manufacturing back to the US.\n\n\"I think the push to industrialize in the United States is appropriate, and it's something we're very aligned with the administration on,\" he said.\n\nThe US EV industry comprises Rivian, Tesla, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, BMW, and Kia, among others.\n\nBrands like Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Tesla dominate the EV market in Europe. Chinese brands like BYD, NIO, and MG also sell on the continent.\n\nMeanwhile, the EV industry in China is seeing fierce competition. BYD, Tesla's biggest global rival, saw its sales fall 12% in October compared to the same period a year earlier, as it faces a tough fight from local EV startups Xpeng, Nio, and Leapmotor.\n\nOther players, such as smartphone manufacturer-turned EV maker Xiaomi, are also seeing success in the country with strong sales.",

    "description": "Export-controlled technology worth US$30 million with fake brand labels was allegedly addressed to a facility near Toronto’s Pearson airport",
    "fullText": "A Chinese-born Canadian citizen who lives in Mississauga, Ont., was arrested in Virginia by the FBI and charged with trying to smuggle restricted high-tech Nvidia computer chips used in AI processing to China\n\nU.S. authorities seized export-controlled technology worth about $30 million that was addressed to an air freight facility in Mississauga, close to Toronto Pearson International Airport, according to allegations filed in court.\n\nNvidia labels on the components had been removed and replaced with labels for a fake company, authorities said.\n\nThe arrest of Benlin Yuan, of Mississauga, immediately west of Toronto, and the large shipment destined for Toronto are part of Operation Gatekeeper, described by U.S. authorities as targeting “a sophisticated illicit procurement conspiracy and smuggling network that orchestrates buying and exporting controlled high-tech computer chips to China.”\n\nYuan is described in U.S. prosecution documents as president of an information technology company based in Virginia that provides data centre services and IT support and consulting in Canada and the United States. The documents say it is a subsidiary of a Chinese company based in Beijing.\n\nHe was arrested in Sterling, Virginia, on Nov. 28 and charged with conspiring to violate export control acts.\n\nThe network is accused of purchasing at least US$50 million worth of GPUs from a large U.S. technology company.\n\nThe computer products Yuan is alleged to be involved in exporting are Nvidia A100, H100, and H200 Tensor Core graphic processing units, known as GPUs, and HGX baseboards. The equipment is used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications and in high-performance computing. The chips can handle huge amounts of data that is needed in AI applications, an exploding field that is revolutionizing technology.\n\nThe GPUs can perform calculations at higher speeds than most previous computers.\n\nSince about November 2023, a Chinese company has worked to import these chips from the United States, prosecutors allege. The entire plot is alleged to have involved US$160 million in tech goods.\n\nYuan is accused of joining the conspiracy this spring.\n\nIn a criminal complaint sworn by a special agent in the U.S. Department of Commerce, Yuan helped buy the technology using straw purchasers and intermediaries, meaning in the name of a person or company that is not the real end buyer.\n\nThe buyers allegedly declared the goods were for use by customers within the United States or in countries that do not require an export licence, including Taiwan and Thailand.\n\nAt various U.S. warehouses, Nvidia labels were allegedly removed from the computer circuits and relabeled with a fake manufacturing brand of SANDKYAN, according to the criminal complaint against Yuan.\n\nWhen preparing the items for export, the shipping paperwork misclassified the products as harmless and unrestricted pieces of tech: “adapters,” “adapter modules,” and “computer controllers,” authorities claim.\n\nThey were then shipped, directly or indirectly, to China.\n\nInvestigators received a tip about pallets of suspicious GPUs at a New Jersey warehouse that were addressed to companies in China.\n\nAn undercover agent was sent inside, where he spent an hour.\n\nThe agent allegedly saw two engineers who appeared to be of Chinese origin unboxing Nvidia components. One of the engineers spoke to the undercover agent in Mandarin, documents say. The engineers said they had to cover up all of the Nvidia branding on the equipment for “export purposes,” court filings allege.\n\nThe agent watched Nvidia labels being pulled off and new ones for the fake firm put in their place. The next day the agent returned and found the boxes had been resealed. The products were now labeled as having been “Made in Taiwan.”\n\nNot only were those packages addressed for shipping to Toronto, but warehouse employees told agents they recently had several similar tech exports to Canada.\n\nThe packages were removed and secured in a government warehouse. That sparked a flow of complaint calls and demand letters about the missing GPUs. The people expecting the goods believed the undercover officer had stolen the products and started negotiating to have them returned, authorities allege.\n\nThey offered $1 million to get their packages back, but insisted the equipment be inspected before payment was made.\n\nYuan is accused of organizing the “inspection.”\n\nHe is accused of recruiting and arranging the group of inspectors and of being one of the six who arrived to examine the packages, about two weeks after the seizure, court filings allege.\n\nThe inspection arrangements were allegedly planned in a group chat using an encrypted communication app and confirmed later over a video conferencing app.\n\nYuan was told by a high-level representative of the buyer in China to make sure no one said the items were destined for China, according to the criminal complaint. He is accused of helping them develop an elaborate “compliance backstory” to justify the products based on false information.\n\nThey also allegedly discussed how to make the million-dollar payment and Yuan was told to send copies of the driver’s licences of everyone on the inspection team. Three trucks were arranged for the pick up.\n\nHe is also accused of handling the storage of a different shipment of Nvidia products destined for China. A cooperating witness for U.S. prosecutors alleged that Yuan told him not to put fake labels on this one as he thought they looked suspicious; he would rather the Nvidia labels just be removed.\n\nAlexander Blanchard, a Virginia-based lawyer for Yuan, declined to comment about Yuan or the case when asked by National Post.\n\n“Operation Gatekeeper has exposed a sophisticated smuggling network that threatens our nation’s security by funneling cutting-edge AI technology to those who would use it against American interests,” said Nicholas Ganjei, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Texas.\n\n“These chips are the building blocks of AI superiority and are integral to modern military applications. The country that controls these chips will control AI technology; the country that controls AI technology will control the future.”\n\nU.S. regulation restricts the export of items that could make a significant contribution to the military potential of other nations or could be detrimental to the foreign policy or national security of the United States.\n\nAdvanced computing integrated circuits, including certain Nvidia-manufactured GPUs were added to the export restriction list in 2022. Some of the latest Nvidia chips have been classed by the U.S. as “critical technologies” that China could use to “modernize its military capabilities in ways that threaten the national security interests of the United States and its allies,” according to export regulations.\n\nThe chips require a special licence to export to China.\n\nOn Monday, the same day Operation Gatekeeper was announced, U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States will allow Nvidia’s H200 processors to be exported to China with a 25 per cent fee.\n\nAlan Hao Hsu, also known as Haochun Hsu, 43, of Missouri City, Texas, and his company both pleaded guilty to smuggling and unlawful export activities in October as part of Operation Gatekeeper.\n\nNewly unsealed court documents say Hsu received more than US$50 million in wire transfers from China to help fund the scheme. He is scheduled for sentencing in February.\n\nFanyue Gong, also known as Tom Gong, 43, a citizen of China who lives in Brooklyn, New York, was also charged in the probe. He is described as the owner of a New York technology company. He was arrested in New York on Dec. 3, and charged with conspiring to smuggle goods out of the United States.\n\nFive unnamed co-conspirators are linked to IT companies based in Hong Kong or Shenzhen, a city on the Pearl River that acts as a bridge between Hong Kong and mainland China.\n\n• Email: ahumphreys@postmedia.com | X: AD_Humphreys\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.

    "fullText": "Ever heard of a chipmaker called \"SANDKYAN?\"\n\nNo? That's because it doesn't exist — it was the fake company name involved in what US authorities are saying was a \"sophisticated\" AI chip-smuggling operation.\n\nOn Monday, prosecutors announced they have arrested several parties in connection with an operation that involved smuggling Nvidia's most advanced AI chips to China and Hong Kong in violation of US export control laws.\n\nAmong those are Fanyue \"Tom\" Gong, a 43-year-old tech-company owner in New York, and Benlin Yuan, a 58-year-old Canadian executive. They were arrested on December 3 and November 28, respectively, after investigators linked them to the trafficking network, the Department of Justice said in a press release published Monday.\n\nThe Nvidia chips, known as GPUs, are used to train cutting-edge AI models and high-performance computing systems. They are tightly restricted due to their potential military applications.\n\n\"These chips are the building blocks of AI superiority and are integral to modern military applications,\" said US Attorney Nicholas Ganjei for the Southern District of Texas, adding that the smuggling operation threatened national security.\n\nYuan's lawyer told Business Insider he had no comment about the cases. A representative for Gong could not immediately be identified.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson told Business Insider that the export system is \"rigorous and comprehensive\" and that it will \"continue to work with the government and our customers to ensure that second-hand smuggling does not occur.\"\n\nIt comes as President Donald Trump on Monday announced his approval for Nvidia to sell H200 chips to China under a plan that includes a 25% payment to the US.\n\nProsecutors said the smuggling operation relied on falsified paperwork, shell companies, and covert relabeling.\n\nThe people involved purchased GPUs through straw buyers and intermediaries who claimed the hardware was destined for US customers or countries that don't require export licenses, prosecutors said.\n\nOnce the chips reached US warehouses, the DOJ said, workers under Gong's direction removed Nvidia labels and then rebranded the GPUs as \"SANDKYAN,\" a fake company name.\n\nShipping documents were also rewritten to classify the GPUs as generic computer parts, the DOJ said.\n\nThe mislabeled GPUs were then exported covertly to China, Hong Kong, and other restricted destinations, often routed through a Hong Kong logistics firm and a China-based AI company.\n\nYuan, who ran the US arm of a Beijing IT company, recruited inspectors and instructed them not to disclose the GPUs' true destination, Ganjei said.\n\nProsecutors said Yuan also helped craft false explanations when federal authorities detained certain shipments.\n\nThe arrests are part of \"Operation Gatekeeper,\" a wider crackdown that earlier led Texas businessman Alan Hao Hsu and his company to plead guilty to smuggling offenses. According to court documents unsealed on December 8, Hsu exported or attempted to export $160 million worth of Nvidia's H100 and H200 chips to China, Hong Kong, and other prohibited countries.\n\nProsecutors said they seized more than $50 million in GPUs and cash from Hsu's operation. The activity took place between October 2024 and May 2025, the DOJ said.\n\nGong and Yuan remain in custody pending further proceedings. Yuan was charged with conspiring to violate the Export Control Reform Act, while Gong was charged with conspiring to smuggle goods out of the US. If convicted, Yuan faces up to 20 years in prison. Gong faces up to 10 years.",

    "fullText": "(Adds dropped word in analyst quote, paragraph 6)\n\nCHICAGO, Dec 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture left its U.S. soybean export forecast unchanged in a monthly report on Tuesday as sales resumed to China, which for months shunned purchases because of its trade war with Washington.\n\nThe USDA pegged soybean exports in the 2025/26 season that ends on August 31 at a 13-year low of 1.635 billion bushels, down 13% from the prior year. Ending stocks were unchanged from a month earlier at 290 million bushels.\n\nThe world’s biggest soy importer resumed buying U.S. soy after a meeting between Presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump in late October, where the White House said China agreed to buy 12 million metric tons from the current crop. Some of the nearly 2.9 million metric tons in confirmed sales to date have already started to ship.\n\nThe purchases, however, were well below levels that China has imported from the U.S. in recent years, and that loss of demand has pressured soybean prices and cost U.S. farmers billions of dollars in lost sales.\n\nFURTHER CUTS TO THE OUTLOOK ARE POSSIBLE\n\nTotal soybean sales to all destinations through early November were down nearly 40% from the same period a year earlier, according to USDA data, suggesting further cuts to the outlook are likely.\n\n\"Maybe the USDA is just leaving the door open for China to buy more or for the rest of world to somehow make up the difference,\" said Ted Seifried, chief strategist at Zaner Group.\n\nThe White House on Monday made public a $12 billion aid package for American farmers hurt by its trade policies.\n\nCorn exports have been robust, and the USDA on Tuesday raised its U.S. corn export forecast as sales of the grain to global buyers have been stronger than anticipated.\n\nU.S. corn exports were seen at a record 3.200 billion bushels, up from 3.075 billion a month earlier, while end-of-season supplies were estimated at 2.029 billion bushels, down from the USDA’s prior-month forecast of 2.154 billion.\n\nBenchmark Chicago Board of Trade soybean futures extended declines after the USDA report, trading at the lowest since October 30, while corn futures firmed.

    "fullText": "Commerce department finalising deal to allow H200 chips to be sold to China as strict Biden-era restrictions relaxed\n\nDonald Trump has cleared the way for Nvidia to begin selling its powerful AI computer chips to China, marking a win for the chip maker and its CEO, Jensen Huang, who has spent months lobbying the White House to open up sales in the country.\n\nBefore Monday’s announcement, the US had prohibited sales of Nvidia’s most advanced chips to China over national security concerns.\n\nTrump posted to Truth Social on Monday: “I have informed President Xi, of China, that the United States will allow NVIDIA to ship its H200 products to approved customers in China, and other Countries, under conditions that allow for continued strong National Security. President Xi responded positively!”\n\nTrump said the Department of Commerce was finalising the details and that he was planning to make the same offer to other chip companies, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel. Nvidia’s H200 chips are the company’s second most powerful, and far more advanced than the H20, which was originally designed as a lower-powered model for the Chinese market that would not breach restrictions, but which the US banned anyway in April.\n\nThe president said the US would receive 25% of the proceeds, more than the 15% previously agreed to with Nvidia in an earlier deal to lift restrictions, and following similar unorthodox plans for the federal government to take a financial cut from private business dealings.\n\nIn August, Trump said the US would receive a 10% stake in the tech company Intel. Some lawmakers have questioned the legality of such arrangements.\n\nAccording to the Hill, the Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Andy Kim of New Jersey sent letters to the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, last week outlining their concerns over selling these chips to China and saying it risked powering the country’s “surveillance, censorship and military applications”.\n\nThey wrote: “I urge you to stop ignoring the input of bipartisan members of Congress and your own experts in order to cut deals that trade away America’s national security.”\n\nOn social media, Warren called for Huang to appear before Congress to testify under oath.\n\nHuang has worked closely with Trump since the inauguration and has made several trips to the White House. The CEO attended the president’s AI summit in July, met Trump as recently as last week and was even a guest at the White House dinner for the Saudi crown price, Mohammed bin Salman. Huang has pledged to invest $500bn in AI infrastructure in the US over the next four years.\n\nHuang has visited China several times, meeting officials and Chinese tech executives, as US bans were variously lifted and reintroduced. Earlier this year, China imposed its own controls on the imports of Nvidia chips, with top tech firms reportedly instructed to cancel orders, citing national security concerns and confidence in China’s domestic chip development.\n\nIn October, Huang said Nvidia has gone from having 95% of the Chinese market to having none, and called the bans a “strategic mistake”.\n\nSelling chips to China, the world’s second largest economy, could now mean a windfall worth billions of dollars for Nvidia, which is already valued at $4.5tn.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson said: “We applaud President Trump’s decision.” He said offering the H200 chips “to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America”.\n\nThe Nvidia spokesperson and Trump said the move would support US jobs and manufacturing.\n\nIn his Truth Social post, Trump condemned the Biden administration’s policies, which imposed strict export controls on powerful chips. The Biden administration had said withholding such technology from China bolstered US competition, protected national security and hampered AI development in China.\n\n“That Era is OVER!” Trump wrote. “My Administration will always put America FIRST.”\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, China’s foreign ministry said it had noted the reports. “China has always adhered to the principle that China and the United States can achieve mutual benefit and win-win results through cooperation,” the spokesperson said.\n\nMa Jihua, a telecom industry analyst, told the state media outlet the Global Times that years of US curbs on AI exports had “provided a rare chance of China’s domestic chip industry to grow and catch up”.",

    "fullText": "HOUSTON – Two businessmen are now in custody for allegedly violating U.S. export control laws, announced U.S. Attorney Nicholas J. Ganjei.\n\nAs part of the overall investigation, a Houston company and its owner have also pleaded guilty to smuggling cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence technology out of the United States.\n\n“Operation Gatekeeper has exposed a sophisticated smuggling network that threatens our Nation’s security by funneling cutting-edge AI technology to those who would use it against American interests,” said Ganjei. “These chips are the building blocks of AI superiority and are integral to modern military applications. The country that controls these chips will control AI technology; the country that controls AI technology will control the future. The Southern District of Texas will aggressively prosecute anyone who attempts to compromise America’s technological edge.”\n\n“The United States has long emphasized the importance of innovation and is responsible for an incredible amount of cutting-edge technology, such as the advanced computer chips that make modern AI possible,” said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg. “This advantage isn’t free but rather the result of our engineers’ and scientists’ hard work and sacrifice. The National Security Division, along with our partners, will vigorously enforce our export-control laws and protect this edge.”\n\nAlan Hao Hsu aka Haochun Hsu, 43, Missouri City, and his company, Hao Global LLC, both pleaded guilty to smuggling and unlawful export activities Oct. 10.\n\nAccording to now unsealed court documents, between October 2024 and May 2025, Hsu and others knowingly exported and attempted to export at least $160 million worth of export-controlled Nvidia H100 and H200 Tensor Core graphic processing units (GPUs).\n\nThe H100 and H200 are high-speed GPUs used for AI applications and high-performance computing. They are designed to process massive amounts of data, advancing generative AI and large language models, and accelerating scientific computing. The GPUs are used for both civilian and military applications. These chips are among the most advanced GPUs ever developed, and their export to the People’s Republic of China is strictly prohibited.\n\nHsu and others falsified shipping paperwork, misclassifying the true nature of the goods and their recipients to conceal the ultimate destination of the GPUs. Hsu and Hao Global received more than $50 million in wire transfers that originated from the People’s Republic of China to help fund the scheme. The GPUs were ultimately shipped to the PRC, Hong Kong and other destinations in violation of U.S. export laws.\n\nAlso charged in relation to the scheme are two PRC natives - Fanyue Gong aka Tom Gong, 43, a PRC citizen who resides in Brooklyn, New York, and Benlin Yuan, 58, a Canadian citizen who resides in Mississauga, Ontario. Law enforcement arrested Gong in New York Dec. 3, and Yuan in Sterling, Virgina, Nov. 28.\n\nYuan is the CEO of a Sterling, Virginia, IT services company which is the U.S. subsidiary of a large PRC IT company based in Beijing, while Gong is the owner of a New York technology company.\n\nAccording to their charges, Gong and Yuan also independently conspired with employees of a Hong Kong-based logistics company and a China-based AI technology company to circumvent U.S. export controls.\n\nThe criminal complaint against Gong alleges co-conspirators obtained Nvidia GPUs through straw purchasers and intermediaries, falsely indicating that the goods were for U.S. customers or customers in third countries that do not require a license to export. The GPUs were shipped to multiple U.S. warehouses where individuals who worked for Gong removed Nvidia labels and re-labelled the GPUs with the name “SANDKYAN” – a fake company – and then prepared the goods for export at his direction, according to the charges. The shipping and export paperwork for the GPUs allegedly misclassified the goods as generic computer parts. The charges allege co-conspirators then shipped the goods or attempted to do so to the PRC and Hong Kong in violation of U.S. laws.\n\nAccording to Yuan’s charges, he helped recruit and organize individuals to inspect the mislabeled GPUs on behalf of the Hong Kong logistics company. Yuan allegedly agreed to direct inspectors not to say the goods were destined for the PRC. The charges also allege Yuan directed discussions regarding crafting a story his company could use to get GPUs and other equipment released after federal law authorities detained it. Yuan allegedly engaged in several conversations about providing false information to U.S. authorities regarding the ultimate customer of the goods.\n\nYuan is also alleged to have participated in and agreed to direct actions involving the handling and storage of another export of Nvidia GPUs on behalf of the Hong Kong logistics company.\n\nHsu faces up to 10 years in federal prison at sentencing Feb. 18, while Hao Global LLC could be fined up to twice the gross gain from the offense and given a term of probation.\n\nIf convicted, Yuan faces up to 20 years for conspiracy to violate the Export Control Reform Act. Gong is charged with conspiracy to smuggle goods from the United States and faces a maximum of 10 years.\n\nHsu was permitted to remain on bond pending sentencing. Yuan and Gong are currently in custody pending further criminal proceedings.\n\nThe Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security - Office of Export Enforcement (Dallas Field Office), Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations – Dallas and FBI Field Offices in New York City and Washington D.C. conducted the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorneys John Marck and Mark McIntyre are prosecuting the case along with Trial Attorneys Fatema Merchant and Yifei Zheng of DOJ’s National Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\n\nA criminal complaint is a formal accusation of criminal conduct, not evidence. A defendant is presumed innocent unless convicted through due process of law.",

    "fullText": "China's open-source artificial intelligence models accounted for nearly 30 per cent of total global use of the technology, while Chinese-language prompts ranked second in token volume behind English, according to a report.\n\nThis year's surge in open-source large language model (LLM) usage around the world had been fuelled by Chinese-developed systems, including Alibaba Group Holding's Qwen family of models, DeepSeek's V3 and Moonshot AI's Kimi K2, according to a recently published report by OpenRouter, a third-party AI model aggregator, and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nProprietary Western models, such as OpenAI's GPT-4o and GPT-5, remained dominant with a 70 per cent global share.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nAccording to the empirical study of 100 trillion tokens by OpenRouter, Chinese open-source LLMs' global share started from a low base of 1.2 per cent in late 2024 to reach nearly 30 per cent over a few months this year. Tokens are units of data processed by AI models during training and inference, enabling prediction, generation and reasoning.\n\nSo far this year, Chinese open-source LLMs averaged 13 per cent of weekly token volume, as growth accelerated in the second half of 2025, to almost match the 13.7 per cent average recorded by AI models from the rest of the world, the report said.\n\n\"China has emerged as a major force, not only through domestic consumption but also by producing globally competitive models,\" the report said.\n\nThe report offered fresh evidence that China has become a close peer of the United States in AI model development, despite Washington's restrictions on Chinese firms' access to advanced graphics processing units from the likes of Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nProprietary Western large language models, such as OpenAI's GPT family, continue to lead global AI usage.

    "fullText": "Nvidia just scored a win from President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social on Monday, Trump said he told Chinese leader Xi Jinping that the US would allow Nvidia to sell its H200 chips to \"approved customers\" in China.\n\n\"This policy will support American Jobs, strengthen US Manufacturing, and benefit American Taxpayers,\" Trump said in the post.\n\nTrump said, \"$25% will be paid to the United States of America.\" He has previously proposed having the US take a cut of chip sales to China.\n\nNvidia's stock was up in after-hours trading following Trump's announcement.\n\n\"We applaud President Trump's decision to allow America's chip industry to compete to support high paying jobs and manufacturing in America,\" a spokesperson for Nvidia said in a statement to Business Insider. \"Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America.\"\n\nNvidia's powerful H200 chips have been in high demand as AI models become more powerful.\n\nWhile Nvidia was already able to sell some of its other chips to China, the US government has limited its ability to sell some powerful chips due to national security concerns. Sales of its H20 chips to China during Q3 were \"insignificant,\" CFO Colette Kress said on its latest earnings call.\n\n\"While we were disappointed in the current state that prevents us from shipping more competitive data center compute products to China, we are committed to continued engagement with the US and China governments and will continue to advocate for America's ability to compete around the world,\" Kress said during the Q3 earnings call.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with Trump last week to discuss export controls on chips.\n\n\"I've said repeatedly that we support export control, that we should ensure that American companies have the best and the most and first,\" Huang told reporters last week.\n\nNvidia stock was up roughly 2% after hours.",
