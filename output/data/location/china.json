    "description": "British automaker Aston Martin — known for its sleek supercars favored by James Bond — announced that it would cut as many as 20% of its employees.",
    "fullText": "British automaker Aston Martin said it's cutting up to 20% of its workforce as it battles supply chain chaos caused by President Donald Trump's shifting tariff policy.\n\nThe company, which is known for its sleek supercars favored by James Bond, said in its Wednesday earnings report that it expects operating expenditure and capex savings of about £40 million ($54 million) from the cuts.\n\nTrump imposed a 25% tariff on car imports last April, adding export costs to the supercars hand-made in Aston Martin's UK factory.\n\nWhile a subsequent US-UK agreement in May provided some relief for British automakers, there has been fresh uncertainty after Trump introduced a 10% global tariff on exports to the US in response to the Supreme Court ruling against his expansive tariff policy. Trump said last weekend that the levy would rise to 15%.\n\nThe auto industry, which relies on carefully choreographed global supply chains, has been hit hard by tariff volatility. Major carmakers, including Toyota, GM, and Ford, have said keeping up with the changes in trade policy has cost them billions of dollars.\n\nAston Martin reported a £493 million ($666 million) loss for 2025 in earnings on Wednesday, with revenue and vehicle sales both dropping.\n\nThe Vantage maker didn't break out the specific tariff costs, but CEO Adrian Hallmark said in the company's earnings report that \"heightened tariffs in the US and China\" weighed on its performance.\n\nAston Martin is also grappling with another industry-wide challenge: the collapse of the Chinese market for Western luxury vehicles.\n\nThe company's sales in the Asia-Pacific region fell by 21% last year, the largest drop of any market. The likes of Porsche and Mercedes have also seen their China sales plunge, as consumers increasingly turn to vehicles made by local brands, many of them electric.",

    "title": "NATO's falling behind in the race to build icebreakers, critical tools for a war in the Arctic",
    "description": "A top Norwegian military official identified icebreakers as one of the capability gaps that exist between NATO and Russia and China.",
    "fullText": "NATO forces are falling behind Russia and China in the race to build icebreakers, ships that would be crucial in an Arctic war, a top Norwegian military official told Business Insider.\n\nIn an interview, Vice Adm. Rune Andersen, chief of the Norwegian Joint Headquarters, identified icebreakers as one of the key capability gaps that exist between NATO and its rivals in the Arctic.\n\nRussia and China are the only two countries that are building icebreakers at scale. The West has been \"falling behind\" in its ability to operate fully in the Arctic compared to Moscow and Beijing, Andersen said last week.\n\nRussia has dozens of icebreakers — roughly 40 by some estimates, far more than any other country — while China, which has increased its Arctic activity in recent years, fields around five. Moscow and Beijing plan to work together to expand that fleet.\n\nThe US, by contrast, fields just one heavy polar icebreaker along with a number of smaller vessels. The Trump administration said last year that the US Coast Guard's fleet of Arctic-capable vessels is \"insufficient to meet current operations demands and presents a national security risk.\" The president also called for a dramatic boost to the overall size of the fleet.\n\nArctic security has become a growing focal point for NATO in recent years as Russian and Chinese activity expands. Increased competition has spotlighted the icebreaker gap.\n\nThese ships, which are purpose-built to crush ice blocking waterways, are critical in this region because they enable better movement across frozen yet strategic terrain, unlocking access to trade routes and natural resources. In a fight, they allow access to the battlespace, as well as enable logistics and support missions.\n\nCanada, Finland, and other NATO allies add dozens of icebreakers to the Western alliance's ice-breaking arsenal, bringing it closer to parity with Russia, but Arctic experts believe nearly a third of them are past their design life. Russia's fleet is heavier and more specialized, built for heavy-ice operations in ways that many alliance vessels aren't.\n\nA NATO official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss military capabilities, told Business Insider that while Russia may have more of certain maritime platforms than the West, the country still faces readiness challenges that affect its ability to put ships to sea.\n\nThis creates \"strategic dilemmas with their force projection,\" the official said.\n\nAndersen said NATO countries have acknowledged the numerical deficit in icebreakers and are making strides to close the gap.\n\nThe Trump administration, for instance, said in October that it plans to order four Arctic Security Cutters, medium icebreaking ships, from Finland and build another seven in American shipyards using Finnish expertise.\n\nThe Coast Guard assesses that it needs at least nine of those ships \"to serve our national security needs year-round in the Arctic,\" the White House said at the time.\n\nFinland is the world leader in icebreaker production. Its companies have designed 80% of the world's icebreakers, and its local shipyards have built 60% of them. Other leading countries include Canada, Russia, and China.\n\nCmdr. Arlo Abrahamson, a spokesperson for NATO's Allied Maritime Command, told Business Insider that member states \"are making tangible investments in icebreakers.\"\n\n\"Our collective capabilities provide allied navies and coast guards the ability to operate in Arctic conditions,\" he added.\n\nBeyond the icebreakers, NATO allies are investing in other technologies and systems to improve their Arctic foothold, including additional surveillance capabilities, drones, satellites, and vehicles that can withstand cold temperatures.\n\nWestern forces have also increased the scale of their Arctic exercises to familiarize soldiers with the harsh terrain and launched new deterrence operations to strengthen their posture across the region.",

Join 7 million investors using Simply Wall St's investing ideas for FREE.\n\nASML Holding (ENXTAM:ASML) reports a breakthrough in EUV lithography that can enable up to 50% higher chip production efficiency.\n\nThe company says its latest EUV machines use a much more powerful light source to help customers process significantly more chips by 2030.\n\nThis development reinforces ASML's position in advanced semiconductor manufacturing as competitors in the U.S. and China work on rival technologies.\n\nASML Holding sits at the center of high end chip production, supplying EUV lithography tools that many chipmakers use for leading edge manufacturing. The new machine design directly targets growing demand for next generation AI chips, an area that has become a key focus across the semiconductor industry.\n\nFor investors watching ENXTAM:ASML, the bigger question is how this technology shift could influence customer investment plans and the competitive gap with other equipment makers. The reported 50% efficiency potential by 2030 may shape long term capacity decisions across foundries and integrated device manufacturers that rely on EUV tools.\n\nStay updated on the most important news stories for ASML Holding by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio. Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on ASML Holding.\n\n2 things going right for ASML Holding that this headline doesn't cover.\n\nThis EUV light-source breakthrough goes straight to the economics of chip production. If a tool can process around 50% more wafers per hour without needing extra floor space or duplicate systems, it can change how customers such as TSMC and Intel think about their long term fab build outs. For ASML, that can translate into a stronger case for its most advanced EUV platforms as fabs push to supply AI and high performance computing chips. It also reinforces why ASML is often treated as a way to get exposure to AI chip demand without choosing a specific chip designer. At the same time, a more productive tool could slow the need for incremental units at the margin if customers can get more output from each system, so investors may want to watch how pricing, service and upgrade revenues evolve alongside unit volumes, especially as U.S. and Chinese equipment makers work on competing technologies.\n\nThis EUV advance aligns with the narrative that ASML’s EUV and High NA platforms support productivity and cost reductions for chipmakers, which can support equipment adoption tied to AI demand.\n\nIf High NA adoption timing or tool maturity proves more complex than expected, the focus on current generation EUV power gains could delay some of the earnings contribution that narrative writers associate with future platforms.\n\nThe news puts more weight on ASML’s installed base and upgrade potential, which is mentioned in the narrative, but the specific impact of higher light output on long term service and upgrade revenue may not yet be fully reflected.",

    "description": "The Supreme Court faced criticism from President Donald Trump after striking his tariff agenda this week, as the president looks towards an upcoming ruling.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump lashed out at the Supreme Court for striking most of his tariff agenda this week, going on to warn that a similar ruling against his birthright citizenship order would be a benefit to China.\n\nTrump made the statement in a post to his Truth Social account on Monday, clarifying that he was not frustrated with the \"Great Three,\" or the justices who sided with his administration in the tariff ruling. The Supreme Court is set to consider Trump's executive order banning birthright citizenship in the coming months.\n\n\"The supreme court (will be using lower case letters for a while based on a complete lack of respect!) of the United States accidentally and unwittingly gave me, as President of the United States, far more powers and strength than I had prior to their ridiculous, dumb, and very internationally divisive ruling,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"Our incompetent supreme court did a great job for the wrong people, and for that they should be ashamed of themselves (but not the Great Three!). The next thing you know they will rule in favor of China and others, who are making an absolute fortune on Birthright Citizenship, by saying the 14th Amendment was NOT written to take care of the 'babies of slaves,' which it was as proven by the EXACT TIMING of its construction, filing, and ratification, which perfectly coincided with the END OF THE CIVIL WAR,\" Trump continued.\n\nTrump Reveals His 'New Hero' Supreme Court Justice After Tariffs Ruling\n\n\"How much better can you do than that? But this supreme court will find a way to come to the wrong conclusion, one that again will make China, and various other Nations, happy and rich. Let our supreme court keep making decisions that are so bad and deleterious to the future of our Nation - I have a job to do,\" he added.\n\nTrump signed his birthright citizenship order on his first day back in office last year. The order seeks to end birthright citizenship for nearly all persons born in the U.S. to undocumented parents, or parents with lawful temporary status in the country — a seismic shift that critics note would break with some 150 years of legal precedent.\n\nTrump's order would reinterpret the 14th Amendment, which states, \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside\" — a provision that administration officials argue has been misinterpreted.\n\nTrump's Tariff Revenues Hit Record Highs As Supreme Court Deals Major Blow\n\nThe language put forth by the Trump administration seeks to clarify that individuals born to illegal immigrant parents, or those who were here legally but on temporary non-immigrant visas, are not citizens by birthright.\n\nA Supreme Court ruling on the issue could have sweeping national implications for an issue Trump officials argue is a crucial component of his hard-line immigration agenda, which has become a defining feature of his second White House term.\n\nMeanwhile, opponents argue that the effort is an unconstitutional and \"unprecedented\" effort that would threaten some 150,000 children in the U.S. born annually to parents of non-citizens, and an estimated 4.4 million American-born children under 18 who are living with an illegal immigrant parent, according to data from the Pew Research Center.\n\nFox News' Breanne Deppisch contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article",

    "title": "I've been a product manager at one of China's biggest tech firms. Here's how Chinese AI products are built differently.",
    "description": "An AI product manager who worked at a Chinese tech giant explains what makes Chinese AI different from the West.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Yilin Zhang, an AI product manager at AI startup Kuse who worked at Meituan for more than three years. It has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified his employment and academic history.\n\nI graduated from Tsinghua University with a master's degree in computer science in 2021 and then joined Meituan — one of China's biggest tech firms — as a product manager.\n\nAt Meituan, China's platform for local services, especially known for food delivery, I worked on two AI projects. One was a consumer-facing AI assistant that helps users complete various tasks, including ordering food. The other was a merchant-facing AI agent designed to help businesses manage their daily operations, including handling reservations, managing orders, and supporting routine operational tasks.\n\nThe main difference between how products are built in China and in the US comes down to the market.\n\nAcross most large Chinese tech companies, AI product development accelerated more aggressively around 2025.\n\nThe AI initiatives I worked on at Meituan started around April or May of that year. It coincided with the surge of interest around DeepSeek, when attention around AI agents took off.\n\nLarge companies began racing to build AI projects, and almost every business unit launched its AI initiative.\n\nFor a long time, especially before 2021 or 2022, Chinese tech companies were primarily focused on domestic competition rather than overseas expansion. Because competition in China is intense, tech companies were forced to become extremely efficient. Their execution methods have been sharpened to an almost frightening degree.\n\nConstraints have also pushed Chinese AI companies to pursue different paths, with a strong focus on open-source models and cost efficiency. These limitations forced exploration in new directions, and those paths have proven valuable in their own way.\n\nDeepSeek is a good example. Because of international restrictions, it couldn't access large numbers of GPUs and was forced to innovate around efficiency instead.\n\nChinese and overseas markets are fundamentally different, leading to distinct user bases, expectations, and product designs.\n\nChinese users have a much lower willingness to pay for software; hence, many mass-market AI products, such as Doubao, tend to be free. The core objective is often to scale active usage.\n\nMany capabilities are packaged into a single prompt you can ask, essentially a chatbox interface with a low barrier to entry.\n\nInternational AI products target users doing high-value tasks. They are more often designed for desktops than for mobile devices, with interfaces better suited to work contexts. These products explore how AI and humans can collaborate and intersect across different work scenarios, helping users complete tasks more effectively and efficiently.\n\nIn China, that user group is relatively small. That makes it harder for its mainstream AI products to move beyond chat-based forms into more advanced products.\n\nChina's internet success over the past decade has also largely come from consumer-facing apps. That environment forces product managers to obsess over user feedback and relentlessly polish even the smallest features.\n\nTeams may spend enormous effort refining a tiny feature just to win over a small group of users. In markets with less competition, that level of detail isn't always necessary.\n\nAfter three to four years at Meituan, I felt I had learned most of what I could from that environment. I left to join the AI startup Kuse in October.\n\nAI is evolving extremely fast. In large companies, iteration speed can be slower. Many of my friends across different Big Tech companies share this same frustration. Smaller, more agile companies can adapt faster.\n\nIn the past, top graduates had basically two paths: becoming a civil servant or joining a Big Tech company.\n\nThat's changing. Especially over the past year, many AI startups have emerged, and more young people are choosing entrepreneurship. AI has created a new path outside Big Tech.\n\nDo you have a story to share about working in a Chinese tech company? Contact this reporter at cmlee@insider.com.",

    "description": "A pioneering energy-generating device utilizes reliable wind speeds at an altitude of 6,500 feet (2,000 meters).",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nA Chinese energy firm has successfully tested an experimental blimp-like wind turbine capable of generating energy in the skies above cities and inland communities.\n\nDeveloped by Beijing Linyi Yunchuan Energy Technology, the S2000 airborne wind energy system (AWES) is a large, helium-filled airship containing 12 wind turbines.\n\nThe craft ascends thousands of feet into the air to harness the stable wind speeds at higher altitudes, which spin the turbines and generate electricity. This is then sent down the tethering cable to the ground below, where it can enter the grid.\n\nIn its test flight, the manufacturers flew the S2000 at an altitude of 6,560 feet (2,000 meters) above Sichuan Province, generating 385 kilowatt-hours of electricity.\n\nThis is enough to power the average U.S. household for approximately 13.3 days, per usage figures provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nIn total, the S2000 clocks in at 197 feet (60 m) long, 131 feet (40 m) high and 131 feet (40 m) wide, as reported by Global Times. The system is rated at 3 megawatts total power capacity.\n\nThe new technology has a couple of potential uses, the developers suggest. \"One is for off-grid settings like border outposts, where it can serve as a relatively stable conventional energy source,” explained Weng Hanke, CTO at Linyi Yunchuan Energy Technology, as reported by Tide News — an affiliate of the state-owned Zhejiang Daily Press Group — via Global Times.\n\n\"The other is to complement traditional ground-based wind power systems, creating a three-dimensional approach to energy supply.\"\n\nIf realized at scale, the approach could have transformational potential for countries with constrained space for onshore wind generation, such as many in mainland Europe, as well as those without the shallow seabeds necessary for offshore wind power generation, such as Japan.\n\nHowever, the reliability of the tethered cable for delivering stable power to the grid will require further testing.\n\nIn all but the most remote rural communities, the 1.25-mile (2,000 m) cable could present a dangerous obstacle to aircraft. In the U.K., the Civil Aviation Authority requires those wishing to fly tethered balloons above 200 feet (60 m) to apply for special permission to avoid risk to aircraft sharing airspace with the balloon.\n\nBeyond its safety concerns, the S2000 will also need to undergo rigorous testing to ensure its viability for reliable commercial operations. Standard wind turbines require regular maintenance and the craft could prove difficult and more costly to service as it will have to return to the ground for every repair.\n\nWind turbines can generate more power where the wind power density — the measure of wind energy that can be harnessed at a given altitude — is higher. Offshore wind turbines, for example, can capture the higher, more consistent wind speeds over open water.\n\nThese offshore turbines can also be significantly larger than their onshore counterparts, with the hub of Chinese manufacturer Dongfang Electric’s DEW-26 MW-310 offshore turbine standing at 606.9 feet (185 m). Floating wind turbines can be similarly gigantic, with the tower for the recently-revealed, record breaking floating wind turbine from China Huaneng Group reaching 489 feet (152 m).\n\nFor example, the average offshore wind speed deemed suitable for wind farms at 295 feet (90 m) elevation within U.S. waters is 7 meters per second, per the Marine Cadastre National Viewer, a web-based data viewer produced by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office for Coastal Management.\n\n—China builds record-breaking floating wind turbine — it could change the face of renewable energy\n\n—Chinese scientists have found a way to make batteries more efficient — by using water\n\nIt’s hard to state the exact wind speed at various altitudes, as this varies by location and weather.\n\nThe aerospace group Omnidea estimates that at altitudes between 328 and 8,200 feet (100 and 2,500 m), wind power density increases by approximately a factor of six, with an average wind speed of 33.5 mph (15 m/s) at 8,200 feet\n\nThis highlights the potential efficiencies to be unlocked with greater exploitation of higher-altitude wind speeds with tethered, flying wind turbines such as the S2000.",

    "description": "Outflows from midsize U.S. firms to China have dropped by approximately 20% since 2024, but there’s a price.",
    "fullText": "A new analysis from the JPMorgan Chase Institute reveals that while aggressive trade policies implemented in 2025 have successfully driven a significant wedge between midsize American businesses and Chinese suppliers, the decoupling has come with a staggering price tag for U.S. companies.\n\nThe report, titled “Tracking international payments: How are midsize firms reacting to tariffs?” paints a picture of a business sector that is bending but not breaking under historic pressure. According to JPMorgan banking data on financial outflows of firms with revenues between $10 million and $1 billion, the cost of importing goods has skyrocketed—and American companies are bearing the brunt.\n\nWhere are U.S. companies sourcing imports instead of China?\n\nHow much have tariff payments increased for midsize firms?\n\nWhat long-term risks do these trade policies pose?\n\nWhy are midsize firms particularly vulnerable to tariff impacts?\n\nWhile these companies scramble for alternative sources to Chinese manufacturing, they’re paying a big price on imports. Following the implementation of tariff rate increases and new universal tariffs in April 2025, monthly tariff payments by these midsize firms have tripled compared with early 2025 levels.\n\nIf the primary objective of the trade policy was to reduce American reliance on Chinese manufacturing, the banking giant’s data suggests the strategy is working. Outflows from midsize U.S. firms to China have dropped by approximately 20% since 2024.\n\nHowever, this retreat from China has not signaled a retreat from the global economy. Instead of reshoring operations entirely, American businesses appear to be engaging in a costly game of musical chairs.\n\nThe report finds that while payments to China fell, outflows to other regions—specifically Southeast Asia, Japan, and India—have accelerated. This evidence points to “import substitution,” where U.S. firms rush to find alternative suppliers in friendly nations to bypass the steepest levies placed on Beijing.\n\nThe JPMorgan researchers warn that while trade volumes have remained stable, the financial health of these companies may be at risk. Midsize firms are uniquely vulnerable; they are often too large to fly under the regulatory radar but “lack the scale to absorb sustained cost increases” compared with massive multinational corporations.\n\nThe burden of these new taxes has been particularly uneven. While the “universal tariffs” announced in April 2025 did capture new firms that previously paid no duties, the JPMorgan analysis found that the vast majority of the surge in government revenue came from firms that were already paying tariffs. Essentially, the policy has intensified the financial pressure on existing importers rather than spreading the cost widely across new players.",

It staged a robotics flex.\n\nAt the annual Spring Festival Gala, the Lunar New Year show in China, humanoid robots from Chinese startup Unitree Robotics flipped, lunged, and swung swords and nunchucks just feet from child performers in a tightly choreographed kung fu routine.\n\nIn one sequence inspired by \"drunken boxing,\" a traditional Chinese martial arts style, the robots staggered, fell backward, then rose again — showcasing advances in control and coordination.\n\nClips circulating online quickly drew comparisons to last year's broadcast, which featured Unitree humanoid robots performing a Chinese folk dance. The choreography then was noticeably simpler.\n\nThe gala, often likened to the US Super Bowl for its massive audience, also featured other Chinese robotics firms, including MagicLab, Galbot, and Noetix, in separate segments throughout the broadcast on Monday evening.\n\nReactions on Chinese social media showed viewers being struck by how quickly the technology has advanced.\n\nOn RedNote, a user who goes by Ma Xiao said in a video posted on Wednesday that during last year's performance, the robots were only \"doing very simple things.\"\n\n\"Now, they're doing kung fu, they're doing flips, they're doing synchronized dancing,\" he said. \"Everybody's shocked.\"\n\n\"Now the rest of the world knows what China's speed is,\" he added.\n\nAnother RedNote user, DKKD, posted a video of friends reacting to the performance on Tuesday, captioning it: \"Three Americans were scared by the Spring Festival robot.\"\n\n\"They were all shocked by the robot's level of evolution (including me),\" the user wrote.\n\nOne viewer in the video can be heard saying: \"It's way more impressive than last year. It's crazy.\"\n\nUnitree CEO Wang Xingxing said in an interview with Chinese media following the gala that the company expects to ship up to 20,000 humanoid robots this year, up from about 5,500 in 2025.\n\nGlobal shipments of humanoid robots could reach \"tens of thousands\" this year, with Unitree potentially contributing between 10,000 and 20,000 units, Wang said on Tuesday.\n\nChinese companies developing humanoid robots and autonomous systems are racing to outdo global rivals.\n\nIn September, Ant Group, an affiliate of Alibaba Group, unveiled R1, a humanoid robot that drew comparisons to Tesla's Optimus. Two months later, EV and robotics maker XPeng introduced the latest version of its humanoid, Iron, which the company described as \"highly human-like.\"\n\nChina's elite universities are also moving to build talent for the sector. In November, China's Ministry of Education issued a notice stating that top institutions are preparing to launch a new undergraduate major in \"embodied intelligence,\" a field that combines AI with robotics.\n\nStill, China's rapid push into robotics hasn't been seamless.\n\nXPeng's Iron fell face-first during its first public appearance in China earlier this year. Its CEO, He Xiaopeng, later wrote on Chinese social media that the mishap was part of \"learning to walk.\"\n\nLast month, a Unitree humanoid kicked an engineer in the groin during a test. Humanoid robots stumbled and fell while racing against humans in a half-marathon in Beijing in April last year.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Feb 17 (Reuters) - A senior U.S. official on Tuesday revealed what he said were new details of an underground nuclear test blast that China allegedly conducted in June 2020.\n\nAssistant Secretary of State Christopher Yeaw told an event at the Hudson Institute ‌think tank in Washington that a remote seismic station in Kazakhstan measured an \"explosion\" of magnitude 2.75 located 450 miles (720 km) away at the Lop ‌Nor test grounds in western China on June 22, 2020.\n\n\"I’ve looked at additional data since then. There is very little possibility I would say that it is anything but an explosion, a singular ​explosion,\" said Yeaw, adding that the data were not consistent with mining blasts.\n\n\"It’s also entirely not consistent with an earthquake,\" said Yeaw, a former intelligence analyst and defense official who holds a doctorate in nuclear engineering. \"It is ... what you would expect with a nuclear explosive test.\"\n\nThe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization, which is charged with detecting nuclear test explosions, said that there was insufficient data to confirm Yeaw's allegation with confidence.\n\nA spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington said the allegation about China conducting ‌a nuclear test was \"entirely unfounded\" and an attempt \"to fabricate ⁠excuses for resuming\" U.S. nuclear testing.\n\n\"This is political manipulation aimed at pursuing nuclear hegemony and evading its own nuclear disarmament responsibilities,\" Chinese embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said in an emailed statement.\n\n\"China urges the U.S. to reaffirm the five nuclear-weapon states' commitment on ⁠refraining from nuclear tests, uphold the global consensus against nuclear tests, and take concrete steps to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime,\" Liu added.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump is pressing China to join the U.S. and Russia in negotiating a replacement pact to New START, the last U.S.-Russia strategic nuclear arms limitation agreement, which expired on February 5.\n\nThe treaty's ​expiration ​has fueled concerns that the world is on the verge of an accelerated nuclear arms ​race.\n\nChina, which has signed but not ratified ‌the 1996 international treaty banning nuclear testing, denied setting off an underground nuclear test blast after the U.S. first leveled the allegation at an international conference earlier this month. China’s last official underground test took place in 1996.\n\nThe PS23 seismic station in Kazakhstan is part of a globe-spanning monitoring system operated by the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO).\n\nThe organization's executive secretary, Robert Floyd, said in a statement that the PS23 station recorded “two very small seismic events” spaced 12 seconds apart on June 22, 2020.\n\nThe CTBTO’s monitoring system can detect \"events\" consistent with nuclear test explosions with yields of 551 tons (500 metric tons) of TNT or greater, he said.\n\n\"These two ‌events were far below that level. As a result, with this data alone, it is ​not possible to assess the cause of these events with confidence,\" Floyd said.\n\nYeaw said that China ​tried to conceal the test by using a method known as ​decoupling, in which the device is detonated inside a large underground chamber to reduce the magnitude of the shockwaves it sends ‌through the surrounding rock.\n\nLike China, the U.S. has signed but not ​ratified the test ban. Under international law, ​both countries are obligated to uphold the pact.\n\nThe U.S. conducted its last underground nuclear test in 1992 and has been relying on a multibillion-dollar program that uses advanced tools and supercomputer simulations to ensure its nuclear warheads work properly.\n\nChina has rejected Trump’s call to negotiate a three-way treaty ​to replace New START, contending that its strategic nuclear arsenal ‌is dwarfed by those of Washington and Moscow, the world’s largest nuclear powers.\n\nThe Pentagon says China now has more than 600 operational ​warheads and is conducting a major expansion of its strategic nuclear force. It projects that China will field more than 1,000 warheads by ​2030.",

    "fullText": "Eye-catching martial arts performance at China gala had viewers and experts wondering what else humanoids can do\n\nDancing humanoid robots took centre stage on Monday during the annual China Media Group’s Spring Festival Gala, China’s most-watched official television broadcast. They lunged and backflipped (landing on their knees), they spun around and jumped. Not one fell over.\n\nThe display was impressive, but prompted some to wonder: if robots can now dance and perform martial arts, what else can they do?\n\nExperts have mixed opinions, with some saying the robots had limitations and that the display should be viewed through a lens of state propaganda.\n\nDeveloped by several Chinese robotics firms, the robots performed a range of intricate stunts, including kung fu, comedy sketches and choreographed dance moves alongside human performers.\n\nClips circulating online quickly drew comparisons with last year’s lunar new year broadcast, which also featured dancing robots but with noticeably simpler movements.\n\nKyle Chan, an expert in China’s technology development at Brookings Institution, a policy organisation in Washington DC, said Beijing uses these public robot performances to “dazzle domestic and international audiences with China’s technological prowess”.\n\n“Unlike AI models or industrial equipment, humanoid robots are highly visible examples of China’s technological leadership that general audiences can see on their phones or televisions,” he said.\n\nPointing to intensifying competition in the tech space between China and the US, Chan added: “While China and the US are neck-and-neck on AI, humanoid robots are an area where China can claim to be ahead of the US, particularly in terms of scaling up production.”\n\nGeorg Stieler, the head of robotics and automation at the global technology consulting firm Stieler Technology and Marketing, also emphasised the symbolism of China’s prime time broadcast.\n\n“What distinguishes the gala from comparable events elsewhere is the directness of the pipeline from industrial policy to prime-time spectacle,” Stieler said in a statement.\n\nComparing this year’s performances with last year’s – when viewers saw “fundamentally a single choreographic mode” with limited motions including walking, twisting and kicking – Stieler said one key signal of China’s robot progress is “the ability to run large numbers of near-identical humanoids in synchronised motion with stable gaits and consistent joint behaviour”.\n\nBut Stieler also noted: “Stage performance does not equate to industrial robustness, yet.” He said what the robots did was the result of being trained for a routine “hundreds or thousands of times – you could not just tell them to change direction or do something completely different”.\n\n“These dance motions involve very little environmental perception and are essentially imitation learning plus a balance-keeping controller. That has little bearing on reliability in unstructured environments, a prerequisite for factory-grade deployment. Also the progress in dexterity is not as fast as in locomotion,” he added.\n\nThe unveiling of China’s latest generation of robots underscores the country’s broader technological ambitions.\n\nMorgan Stanley projects that China’s humanoid sales will more than double to 28,000 units in 2026; and Elon Musk has said he expects his biggest competitor to be Chinese companies as he pivots Tesla toward a focus on embodied AI and its flagship humanoid Optimus. “People outside China underestimate China, but China is an ass-kicker next level,” Musk said last month.\n\nMarina Zhang, a technology professor at the University of Technology Sydney, said that such a visible showcase likely hints at a new phase in China’s manufacturing masterplan, “where robotics becomes a linchpin in the shift from low-cost assembly to high-end, smart manufacturing”.",

    "fullText": "A US law firm has accused Lenovo of violating Justice Department strictures about the bulk transfer of data to foreign adversaries, namely China.\n\nThe case filed by Almeida Law Group on behalf of San Francisco-based \"Spencer Christy, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated\" centers on the Data Security Program regulations implemented by the DOJ last year.\n\nAccording to the suit [PDF], these were \"implemented to prevent adversarial countries from acquiring large quantities of behavioral data which could be used to surveil, analyze, or exploit American citizens' behavior.\"\n\nThe complaint states the DOJ rule \"makes clear that sending American consumers' information to Chinese entities through automated advertising systems and associated databases with the requisite controls is prohibited.\"\n\nThe case states the threshold for \"covered personal identifiers\" is 100,000 US persons or more and lists a range of potential identifiers, from government and financial account numbers to IMEIs, MAC, and SIM numbers, demographic data, and advertising IDs.\n\nIt then alleges that Lenovo's website \"uses trackers which expose American's [sic] behavioral data to foreign adversaries.\"\n\n\"When a user lands on the homepage of Website, [sic] the Website loads numerous first and third-party tracking implementations that measure and record user data,\" it says, including the likes of TikTok, Facebook, Microsoft, and Google.\n\nThis allows Lenovo to collect bulk personal data, it claims, and \"Lenovo knowingly permits access to, or transfer of, such bulk US sensitive personal data to entities or persons that qualify as covered persons under the DOJ Rule, including its foreign parents that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in China, such as the Lenovo Group.\"\n\nThis means that Lenovo Group, operating under Chinese jurisdiction, \"can use this data to build detailed dossiers on US residents, identify psychological or financial vulnerabilities, and target individuals in sensitive roles – such as jurists, military personnel, journalists, politicians, or dissidents,\" or so the lawyers allege.\n\nThat data could be \"weaponized for profiling, coercive targeting, or even blackmail.\"\n\nThe named plaintiff visited Lenovo's website multiple times in November and December 2025, the suits says, triggering trackers that violated \"his reasonable expectation of privacy\" and resulting in \"the unauthorized disclosure of personal information to a foreign entity.\"\n\nThe suit calls for class action status and seeks \"relief, restitution, and disgorgement\" as well as \"statutory damages in amounts to be determined by the Court and/or jury.\"\n\nThe Register asked Lenovo to comment on the case, and whether it had transferred customer data to China.\n\nIn a statement, Lenovo said: \"Any suggestion that Lenovo improperly shares customer data is false. We take data privacy and security seriously and comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations globally, including stringent US requirements. Our data practices are transparent, lawful, and designed to protect our customers.\"\n\nThe suit remains silent on whether the use of trackers, which could ultimately be used to profile individuals and potentially target those in sensitive positions, is permissible in and of itself.\n\nThe Reg contacted but has not heard back from Almeida Law Group, which specializes in data privacy and security cases, and class action settlements, among other areas. ®",

    "fullText": "MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The United States plans to deploy more high-tech missile systems to the Philippines to help deter aggression in the South China Sea, where the treaty allies on Tuesday condemned what they called China’s “illegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive activities.”\n\nBeijing has repeatedly expressed alarm over the installation in the northern Philippines of a U.S. mid-range missile system called the Typhon in 2024 and of an anti-ship missile launcher last year. It said the U.S. weapons were aimed at containing China’s rise and warned that these were a threat to regional stability.\n\nChina has asked the Philippines to withdraw the missile launchers from its territory, but officials led by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. have rejected the demand.\n\nU.S. and Philippine officials held annual talks Monday in Manila on broadening security, political and economic engagements and boosting collaboration with regional security allies.\n\nThe U.S. and the Philippines outlined in a joint statement Tuesday specific defense and security plans for this year, including joint military exercises, Washington's support to help modernize the Philippine military and efforts “to increase deployments of U.S. cutting-edge missile and unmanned systems to the Philippines.”\n\nThe longtime allies \"underscored their support for preserving freedom of navigation and overflight, unimpeded lawful commerce and other lawful uses of the sea for all nations,” the statement said.\n\n“Both sides condemned China’s illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive activities in the South China Sea, recognizing their adverse effects on regional peace and stability and the economies of the Indo-Pacific and beyond,” it added.\n\nConfrontations between Chinese and Philippine coast guard forces have spiked in the disputed waters in recent years. Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan are also involved in the territorial standoffs.\n\nNeither side elaborated on the planned missile deployments but Philippine ambassador to Washington, Jose Manuel Romualdez, who took part in Monday’s talks, said U.S. and Filipino defense officials discussed the possible deployment this year of “upgraded” types of U.S. missile launchers that the Philippines may eventually decide to purchase.\n\n“It’s a kind of system that’s really very sophisticated and will be deployed here in the hope that, down the road, we will be able to get our own,” Romualdez told The Associated Press.\n\nThe Typhon missile system that the U.S. Army deployed to the main northern Philippine region of Luzon in April 2024 and an anti-missile launcher called the Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System that was deployed in April last year also to Luzon have remained in the Philippines, Romualdez said.\n\nDuring joint drills, U.S. forces have exhibited the missile systems to batches of Filipino forces to familiarize them with the weapons’ capabilities and usage, military officials said.\n\nRomualdez said the U.S. missile deployments to the Philippines did not aim to antagonize any country.\n\n“It’s purely for deterrence,” he said. “Every time the Chinese show any kind of aggression, it only strengthens our resolve to have these types.”\n\nThe Typhon missile launchers, a land-based weapon, can fire the Standard Missile-6 and the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile. Tomahawk missiles can travel over 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers), which places China within their target range, from the northern Philippine region of Luzon.\n\nLast year, the U.S. Marines deployed the anti-ship missile launcher, the Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System, to Batan island in the northernmost Philippine province of Batanes, which faces the Bashi Channel just south of Taiwan.\n\nThe sea passage is a critical trade and military route that the U.S. and Chinese militaries have tried to gain strategic control of.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Feb 16 (Reuters) - China's most-watched TV show, the annual CCTV Spring Festival gala, will be viewed later on Monday as a showcase for the country's cutting-edge industrial policy and Beijing's push to dominate humanoid robots and the future of manufacturing.\n\nFour ‌rising humanoid robot startups - Unitree Robotics, Galbot, Noetix and MagicLab - are set to showcase their products in the gala, a televised event ‌and touchstone for China comparable to the Super Bowl for the United States.\n\nThe hype surrounding China's humanoid robot sector comes as major players including AgiBot and Unitree prepare for initial ​public offerings this year and domestic artificial intelligence startups release a raft of frontier models during the lucrative nine-day Lunar New Year public holiday.\n\nLast year's gala stunned viewers with 16 full-size Unitree humanoids twirling handkerchiefs and dancing in unison with human performers.\n\nUnitree's founder met President Xi Jinping weeks later at a high-profile tech symposium - the first of its kind since 2018.\n\nXi has met five robotics startup founders in the past year, comparable to the four electric vehicle and ‌four semiconductor entrepreneurs he met in the same ⁠timeframe, giving the nascent sector unusual visibility.\n\nThe CCTV show, which drew 79% of live TV viewership in China last year, has for decades been used to highlight Beijing's tech ambitions including its space programme, drones and robotics, said ⁠Georg Stieler, Asia managing director and head of robotics and automation at technology consultancy Stieler.\n\n\"What distinguishes the gala from comparable events elsewhere is the directness of the pipeline from industrial policy to prime-time spectacle,\" Stieler said.\n\n\"Companies that appear on the gala stage receive tangible rewards in government orders, investor attention, and market access.\"\n\nBehind ​the ​spectacle of robots running marathons and executing kung-fu kicks and backflips, China has positioned ​robotics and AI at the heart of its next-generation ‌AI+ manufacturing strategy, betting that productivity gains from automation will offset pressures from its ageing workforce.\n\n\"Humanoids bundle a lot of China's strengths into one narrative: AI capability, hardware supply chain, and manufacturing ambition. They are also the most 'legible' form factor for the public and officials,\" said Beijing-based tech analyst Poe Zhao.\n\n\"In an early market, attention becomes a resource.\"\n\nChina accounted for 90% of the roughly 13,000 humanoid robots shipped globally last year, far ahead of U.S. rivals including Tesla's Optimus, according to research firm Omdia. Morgan Stanley projects that China's humanoid sales will more than double to 28,000 units this ‌year.\n\nElon Musk has said he expects his biggest competitor to be Chinese companies as ​he pivots Tesla toward a focus on embedded AI and Optimus. \"People outside China underestimate ​China, but China is an ass-kicker next level,\" he said last ​month.\n\nSo far, the real-world rollout has been limited to demonstration projects, often with support. Galbot, for example, has a ‌contract to use its humanoid robots in factories run by ​battery giant CATL, one of its ​major investors. UBTech won a government contract last year to send humanoid robots to work in logistics and support roles at a border crossing with Vietnam.\n\nChinese startups are also rapidly iterating AI models to train humanoid \"brains\", using real-world data collection to improve their environmental perception ​and understanding of natural language commands.\n\nAnalysts will watch ‌Monday's performance for innovations including multi-robot coordination, fault recovery and hand-related tasks like fine-object manipulation.\n\n\"A robot doing a backflip is still ​far more spectacular than one carefully gripping a plastic cup of water — even though the latter is technically much more demanding,\" ​Stieler said.",

    "fullText": "China is a huge market for the NBA, and that is nothing new. Among the league’s international audiences, few countries can go toe to toe with the second-most populous nation in the world. Because of that, the NBA makes sure to establish its presence on the ground every single year. The face of the league, LeBron James, understands this as well.\n\nJames has been to China 15 times so far for his Nike promo tour. It’s also not been that long since his last visit, with the King traveling to China as recently as 2025 to promote his “Forever King” tour, to promote his LeBron 23 shoes. Was it also a farewell visit? One last visit to China?\n\nNot according to James, who, during media availability at All-Star Weekend, admitted that he would like to make another trip to the East.\n\n“To all my fans and people over there it’s always been great,” James stated. “Always welcomed me and my friends and family in open arms. I’ve always appreciated it, they’re be another opportunity for me to go over there at some point.”\n\nJames has remained coy on his relationship with China over the years. He found himself in hot water in 2019 when he went against Daryl Morey’s statement on China.\n\n“I don’t want to get in a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke.”\n\nSince then James has returned to China on a semi-regular basis as he did before the incident as well. So, it’s safe to say he’s welcome in the country to quite a fair extent.\n\nEven if James retires from the NBA after the 2025-26 season, as some believe he will, Nike, which has supported him throughout his career, would still look to capitalize on his popularity in China. Both James and the iconic American brand remain hugely popular there, despite the political tensions between the two countries.\n\nAt the same time, it looks as though James has another country in his mind he would love to visit. And that’s Israel.\n\nIn the same presser in L.A., James was asked about his thoughts on the Middle-Eastern country, and his reply showed that he really wanted to go there. “If I have fans over there — I’ve never been there — I hope you follow my career, I hope I inspire people over there.”\n\n“Not only to be great in sports, but to be better in general in life, hopefully someday I can make it over there,” the Lakers icon added. “I’ve heard great things and I appreciate the question.”\n\nFor now, though, James cannot travel anywhere that far from home. Crunch time in the season is here with the All-Star break nearly over, and his focus is solely on possibly ending his career with a fifth ring.\n\nThe post LeBron James Admits To Wanting To Visit China “At Some Point” appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "Although China launching a hypersonic missile towards America isn't that simple, it may still surprise you just how fast these weapons could reach the West.",
    "fullText": "Technological advancements are a double edged-sword. Telecommunication and fast transport through airplanes have made life much more convenient, and medical advancements have made conditions easier to treat. However, that same science is used to create weapons of mass destruction that can potentially leave everlasting stains on human history. A hypersonic missile is one of the scariest, being able to traverse the globe faster than sound.\n\nHypersonic missiles move at five times the speed of sound, meaning they can go over Mach 5 (3,836 miles per hour). Most commercial airplanes are slower than Mach 1, making such high speeds impossible to comprehend. China has a number of terrifying technologies at its disposal — such as its large aircraft carrier with a 100 drone capacity or high-powered drone-frying microwave – but even a simple missile is more than a significant threat. If China suddenly targeted U.S. soil, how fast would a hypersonic missile land, and would we even have enough time to intercept it?\n\nTo answer, we'd need to calculate wind turbulence, the angle of projection, the curvature of the earth, gravity, and additional factors that require a group of engineers. Fortunately, we don't need all that to get a good estimate. We can just use the formula for speed, distance, and time: Time = Distance/Speed. Generally, it can take anywhere from around an hour to less than 20 minutes, depending on certain factors.\n\nChina has many different weapons with varying speeds and distances. For this calculation, we'll use the DF-27A due to its high maneuverability and relatively fast speed –- though China has faster missiles around.\n\nWe can assume the missile originates from China's Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in Shanxi which is 5,130 miles to Hawaii, 5,650 miles to Seattle, and 7,080 miles to New York. The DF-27A is said to reach average speeds of around Mach 8.6, which means it can cover 6,598 miles in an hour. Plugging these numbers into the formula, the missile would take 47 minutes to reach Hawaii, 51 to Seattle, and 64 to New York from mainland China.\n\nKeep in mind that these only account for a specific scenario, though. If China chose to target an island like Guam — just 2,676 miles away from Shanxi — the missile will reach in just 24 minutes. If China launches it from a coastal city like Fuzou — where the distance to Guam becomes just 1,864 miles — it'll only take 17 minutes for the missile to hit.\n\nEven if China could send a hypersonic missile at America out of the blue, our theoretical experiment isn't as simple as it seems. China is fully capable of attacking certain U.S. cities, but an Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) like the DF-27 simply isn't built for such distances. The missile could still hit Guam or other remote islands, but it can't travel further away in Central America.\n\nThis doesn't mean that China can't target Central American cities, though, just that a hypersonic missile like the DF-27 wouldn't be what they use. High-supersonic Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) like the DF-31, the DF-41, and the DF-5C can all travel much further, with DF-5C specifically having global access. The DF-27 is considered more of a threat because of its use of a Hypersonic Glide Vehicle (HGV) that is significantly harder to predict the path of – something that might become even scarier with China getting access to better NVIDIA AI chips.\n\nA DF-5C nuclear warhead would take less than half the time to the American mainland as a DF-27. Resources estimate its speed at tens of Mach, with some claiming it can reach Mach 22. At Mach 22, it'll take 6 minutes to reach Guam, 19 minutes to Hawaii, 20 minutes to Seattle, and 25 minutes to New York. If you order pizza at the same time China presses launch, the missile will likely reach first.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "fullText": "After five years in Qatar, Elisa Orsi and her husband, David Sleight, knew they were ready to leave the desert behind.\n\nThey had moved from Australia to the Middle Eastern country in 2019 with their three kids — all under 6 — after Sleight accepted a job there.\n\nAlready big travelers before they had kids, the couple used school holidays to see the world after starting a family, before later leveraging Sleight's teaching career to travel even more.\n\n\"Usually when people have children, it deters them from travel, but we went completely the other way,\" Orsi, 37, a stay-at-home mom, told Business Insider.\n\nLife in Qatar felt safe and comfortable, and it served as a base from which they could explore the region, traveling to places like Jordan, Turkey, and Egypt.\n\nGradually, the couple found themselves looking for something new.\n\n\"By the time we came back from our summer holiday in 2024, we said, 'OK, we're done. We need a change,'\" Orsi said.\n\nIn August 2024, the family packed up their bags and moved to Hangzhou, a bustling city in eastern China.\n\nChina had been on their radar for a long time, though neither of them had visited before.\n\nIt wasn't until Sleight came across an online job ad for a teaching role in Hangzhou that they began looking into the city.\n\n\"I was impressed with the natural beauty and how modern the city appeared. I knew China was very well connected by the railway infrastructure, so I wasn't overly concerned about the location,\" Sleight, 45, told Business Insider.\n\nThe couple looped their kids, who are now 11, 9, and 7, into the conversation about moving to China early. \"We wanted to give them lots of time to process and to get an understanding of what was happening,\" she said.\n\n\"We have a philosophy that we talk to our children, and we keep them informed about the decisions we make,\" Orsi said.\n\nTo ease the transition, they showed their kids YouTube videos about China and the school they would attend.\n\nWhen they arrived in Hangzhou, Orsi said their first impressions quickly put any lingering nerves at ease.\n\n\"We were actually quite shocked to see how clean, how modern, how organized, and how convenient everything is,\" Orsi said. \"Sometimes you watch videos, but unless you're actually in it, you can't really understand it to that degree until it affects your life.\"\n\nTheir children attend an international school, and Sleight teaches English in the school's bilingual program.\n\nHouse-hunting was a breeze because the school put them in contact with a real-estate agent ahead of their move.\n\n\"We wanted to have a bedroom for each of the kids, and we were looking for amenities,\" she said. \"Most importantly, we wanted to be close to the school.\"\n\nWithin 10 days of arriving in China, the family moved into a four-bedroom apartment. It's about a five-minute drive from the school and roughly 50 minutes outside the city center, in a neighborhood dominated by local Chinese families.\n\nRent is 5,500 Chinese yuan, or about $790 a month, and is covered by the school as part of Sleight's employment contract.\n\nEven with a growing foreign community, the transition isn't always easy.\n\n\"During staff meetings and presentations, I wear an earpiece and listen to a live translation provided by the school's professional translator,\" he said. Sleight added that parents and staff also communicate through a messaging app with built-in translation.\n\n\"If anything were to go wrong, the issue would be resolved very, very quickly. So the children, they can be outside on their own,\" Orsi said. She added that she probably wouldn't feel comfortable giving her kids the same level of freedom even in Townsville, a city in North Queensland, where they lived before moving to Qatar.\n\nIt's also common to see children wearing kid-friendly smartwatches, which let them be more independent.\n\n\"You can see their location, they can call you, they can pay for things, and so they can go anywhere. They'll organize their own play dates and go and meet their friends,\" she said.\n\nAs a woman, Orsi also feels safe walking alone, including from the train station late at night. \"I have not thought about it twice. I wouldn't do it in Australia. And I wouldn't do it in Argentina, where I'm from,\" she said. Orsi moved to Australia in her teens and later met Sleight while working at a telecommunications company.\n\nIt took a year, but Orsi says the family finally feels settled in their new home. Most of their social circle has grown out of the school community, including other parents and foreign teachers.\n\nThe longer school days have also given Orsi more time for herself. She said she's picked up new hobbies, including learning to play the piano, going to the gym, and focusing on content creation for their YouTube channel, where she and Sleight document their family life in China.\n\nSleight is on a three-year contract at the school. As for what comes next, Orsi said the family hasn't made any firm decisions.\n\n\"I think we would probably like to move elsewhere and go to another country when our contract is up, but that could change,\" she said. \"We may very well decide to stay in China and move to another school or experience a different city.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about relocating to a new city?

    "fullText": "Ever since Eileen Gu decided to compete under the flag of China, and not the United States where she was born, her citizenship has been the subject of scrutiny and controversy.\n\nBorn in San Francisco, she said her decision to switch allegiance back in 2019 had everything to do with “inspiring” children from the country of her mother at the Olympics in her home country. That would be the 2022 Beijing Games, where Gu won two golds and a silver for China in freestyle skiing.\n\nShe’s since become a millionaire many times over, mainly due to her online presence and endorsements, not her skiing. She was the fourth-highest earning female athlete in 2025, earning upwards of $23 million. According to Sportico, all but $20,000 of that $23 million came from endorsements.\n\nNow, she’s back in the Olympics, still competing for China and, reportedly, being paid handsomely to do so.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Gu and Zhu Yi, a fellow American-born figure skater who now competes for China, were paid a combined $6.6 million by the Beijing Municipal Sports Bureau in 2025 for “striving for excellent results in qualifying for the 2026 Milan Winter Olympics.” In all, the two were reportedly paid nearly $14 million over the past three years.\n\nThe payments were revealed when the Beijing Municipal Sports Bureau budget was posted online with the names of Gu and Zhu. Their names have since been scrubbed from the public report.\n\nGu already has a silver in slopestyle in Italy, while Zhu — born Beverly Zhu in Los Angeles — is not competing in the 2026 Games.\n\n\"Sometimes it feels like I'm carrying the weight of two countries on my shoulders,” Gu said after winning silver in slopestyle. “Just being able to ski through all of that, you know. To still show my best and still be so deeply in love with the sport.\n\n\"That's really what I care about and I'm so happy to represent that today.\"\n\nThe subject of Gu’s citizenship remains shrouded in mystery. China does not allow dual citizenship, meaning Gu ostensibly had to give up her U.S. passport.\n\nGu will compete in two more events — women’s halfpipe and big air.",

    "description": "When I studied abroad in college, I attended the school that just unseated Harvard as one of the best in the world: Zhejiang University in China",
    "fullText": "In the spring of 2013, I was a sophomore at Tufts University in Massachusetts, soon to declare a dual major in international relations and Mandarin Chinese.\n\nDespite my lofty aspirations to travel the world as a diplomat, my academic career so far had taken me a whopping 25 miles north of my hometown. That's why my university's study abroad program in China appealed to me.\n\nOnce I heard the tales of adventure from the 2012 program's freshly minted graduates, I eagerly applied. That summer, with an acceptance letter in hand, I set off to enroll at Zhejiang University.\n\nUpon landing in Shanghai, my American classmates and I were piled into a minibus for the two-hour drive south to the garden city of Hangzhou — capital of Zhejiang Province and home to Zhejiang University (affectionately referred to by locals as ZheDa).\n\nAfter settling into the dorm, which was a single room with a private bathroom, we were welcomed by our professors with a banquet at the college's canteen — an establishment which was far better than the standardized cafeteria fare that I'd come to know back in New England.\n\nIn our dormitory building, for the equivalent of $2 at the time, one could acquire a filling meal any time of the day — from rice porridge and steamed buns in the morning to stir-fried vegetables and sweet and sour pork tenderloin in the evening, all cooked fresh to order.\n\nZhejiang University was massive and spread across multiple campuses throughout the city. Fortunately for us newcomers, our group at the University's International College was tucked into a leafy hillside on the historic Yuquan campus, offering a slice of Chinese university life at an approachable scale.\n\nAs the sweltering days of summer transitioned into an osmanthus flower-scented autumn, I settled into a new school year. Each morning consisted of four hours of intensive language instruction, followed by at least a few more hours of homework and self-study in the afternoon.\n\nIn addition, each week we'd attend one three-hour lecture on Chinese Peasant History with our advisor, who drew heavily from his own experiences as an academic sent to the countryside during Mao's Cultural Revolution.\n\nI also had a three-hour lecture on the Chinese Legal System with a professor who'd argued many cases within China's rapidly evolving court system.\n\nWhile my application to enroll in Zhejiang University was relatively quick and painless, the road to admission for most of ZheDa's domestic student population was comparatively long and grueling.\n\nFrom an early age, they'd studied for hours at school, followed by hours at buxiban (cram schools), preparing to ace China's notoriously difficult standardized exams, such as the Gaokao. Of the millions who sit for the Gaokao each year, only the highest scorers earn spots in China's most prestigious schools, such as Peking, Tsinghua, and Zhejiang universities.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the academic work ethic that carried students to Zhejiang University did not fall off after admission. While most of my international classmates would study long hours during the week, we would take Friday nights and weekends off to travel within China. But many local students, however, rarely engaged in such frivolous pursuits and were more likely to be studying in the library on a Friday or Saturday evening.\n\nAs exams marked the end of my semester at ZheDa in December 2013, I personally experienced the exacting academic standards that my Chinese classmates were intimately familiar with. While I did pass all of my classes, a minor error in pronunciation or a stroke askew in a written character, mistakes that my Chinese professors back at Tufts may have overlooked, were marked down harshly by my professors at Zhejiang University.\n\nWhen scrolling Instagram in January 2025, I saw a familiar sight in a post from The New York Times — a statue of Mao Zedong standing before Laohe Hill and a familiar library, waving to the students on a verdant Yuquan Campus. Reading on, I was proud to learn that my study abroad alma mater had been named the most productive research university in the world by Leiden Rankings, outpacing even my hometown juggernaut, Harvard.\n\nI cannot say that I am shocked by this development. My semester at ZheDa showed me a culture of academic rigor on a scale few American universities can match, drawing from an academic talent pool far larger than in the US.\n\nMy time at ZheDa forced me out of my comfort zone and exposed me to an academic world significantly different from that in which I'd been educated, and I believe I am a more open-minded learner for it.",

China's share of Brazil's beef trade was roughly half, by value and volume.\n\nGoing forward, however, Brazilian companies may ​not ​be selling as much to their top trade ​partner, as Beijing introduced maximum annual ‌import quotas for suppliers over three years. Anything exceeding a certain threshold will be levied a 55% tariff.\n\nChina's \"safeguard measures\" spooked local processors. But as Beijing is unwavering, the Brazilian government is now discussing with the industry a plan to assign specific quotas to companies, in the same proportion as their exports to ‌China last year, to regulate supplies.\n\nDefenders of ​the move argue it could avoid upward pressure ​on cattle prices, or a ​fall of beef export prices, as local companies rush to ‌export to China to fill their quota ​faster than others. ​Detractors say it may allow unprecedented meddling with food exports.\n\nBeijing will exempt 1.106 million metric tons of Brazilian beef from additional tariffs this year. ​On average, local exporters ‌would sell some 92,000 tons monthly to China under the threshold, ​which compares with nearly 140,000 tons monthly in 2025.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Feb 12 (Reuters) - China's chief trade negotiator Li Chenggang met Mexico's Deputy Economy Minister Vidal Llerenas in Beijing on Monday, in ‌the first face-to-face talks since Mexico imposed higher tariffs on Chinese imports, ‌drawing warnings from Beijing.\n\nThe two countries conducted in-depth exchanges on bilateral economic and trade relations and ​other issues, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nHow do USMCA negotiations affect Chinese investment plans?\n\nHow might China respond to Mexico's tariff increases?\n\nWhy did Mexico impose higher tariffs on China?\n\nWhat impact could tariffs have on China-Mexico trade?\n\nMexico announced in December steep tariff increases on China and other countries without free trade agreements with Mexico - most up to 35%. The move was widely interpreted by analysts as an attempt ‌to placate U.S. President Donald ⁠Trump, who levied significant tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nMexico's duties apply to thousands of goods including automobiles, auto parts, textiles, clothing, plastics and ⁠steel.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said the tariffs are intended to increase domestic production and address trade imbalances. The tariffs are expected to have the biggest impact on China, which ​is Mexico's ​second-largest trading partner after the United States.\n\nChina's ​Commerce Ministry had warned Mexico to \"think ‌twice\" before levying tariffs and said it would take steps in response to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests, but it has so far not announced countermeasures.\n\nSeparately, China's top automaker BYD said in 2024 it was considering setting up a factory in Mexico, although the FT reported in March that China was delaying approval for ‌the plant over concerns of technology leakage to ​the United States.\n\nThe China-Mexico talks come as the ​U.S., Mexico and Canada prepare to ​jointly review their free trade agreement by July 1.\n\nThe U.S.' top ‌trade negotiator has said the pact ​is not equipped to ​deal with surges of exports and investment from non-market economies such as China into the region, suggesting the U.S. may press for tighter rules on ​China-origin goods in a ‌new agreement. That would make it harder for Chinese firms to use ​Mexico as a base for exporting to the U.S.",

    "description": "Without more aircraft to hit Chinese defenses, the Air Force might have to hold back, risking the military getting drawn into a slog, experts said.",
    "fullText": "The US Air Force will need a lot more next-generation fighter jets and bombers to fight a war against China, former pilots and airpower experts argued in a new report.\n\nThey said the Air Force will need to procure significantly more of the new and coming B-21 Raider bombers and F-47 fighter jets than it currently plans to buy. Insufficient numbers may force the service to operate conservatively, potentially giving China an edge in such a fight, they warned in a Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies policy paper out this week.\n\nThe report said that China's anti-access and area-denial network, together with its natural geography, creates sanctuaries from which its air and missile defenses can fire. The firepower available to Chinese forces within these sanctuaries could pose a threat to US forces, making eliminating them critical to US operations.\n\n\"The Air Force's stealthy bombers and fighter inventories have the survivability needed to penetrate high-density threat areas but lack enough sortie capacity for a conflict with China,\" wrote report authors Heather Penney and retired Air Force colonel Mark Gunzinger.\n\nThe authors propose that the Air Force field at least 200 B-21s and 300 F-47s, which would be roughly double the service's current plans. The Air Force has said it will purchase at least 185 of the F-47s developed by Boeing and at least 100 of the B-21s produced by Northrop Grumman. The Mitchell Institute identifies Boeing and Lockheed Martin as supporters.\n\nThe authors additionally recommended boosting procurement of Lockheed's fifth-generation F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter and Boeing's advanced F-15EX Eagle II.\n\nIn an virtual event discussing the new report, Penney, a former F-16 pilot, said that past conflicts in Korea and Vietnam, as well as Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine, have shown that unless militaries take out enemy bases and sanctuaries, they could end up stuck in wars of attrition, the gradual bleeding of personnel and resources and little movement on the battlefield.\n\nIn a conflict with China, the US would likely face more advanced air defenses than it did in last year's Midnight Hammer operation against Iran or this year's Operation Absolute Resolve against Venezuela. Without a greater reserve of aircraft, Penney said, Air Force tactics for targeting Chinese sanctuaries would likely have to be less aggressive to avoid unnecessary risk to a limited fleet.\n\nThe B-21 is in low-rate initial production, though the only deliveries have been test, not operational, aircraft, while the contract for the design and development of the F-47 fighter jet was only awarded last year.\n\nNeither aircraft is expected to be operational in significant numbers for years. In the meantime, the Air Force is dependent on older, though still capable, bombers like the B-52 Stratofortress, B-1 Lancer, and B-2 Spirit.\n\nThe Mitchell Institute said budget increases of at least $40 billion a year could support higher procurement rates, as well as the acquisition of uncrewed Collaborative Combat Aircraft, or \"loyal wingmen\" drones, which Air Force officials have said won't replace crewed planes but instead complement them.\n\nMultiple assessments have found the Air Force's fleet is the smallest, oldest, and least combat-ready it has been in decades. By the numbers, today's inventory of fighters, bombers, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft is a fraction of its Cold War strength.\n\nAt the same time, experts have highlighted that the Air Force has been under increased strain due to constant conflicts and missions. A US Government Accountability Office report from 2024 said continuous deployments had reduced Air Force readiness, personnel, equipment, and aircraft. The government watchdog agency found that the service was pursuing fixes to these issues, but the demand on these forces was still higher than capacity.",

    "fullText": "LIMA, Peru (AP) — The Trump administration on Wednesday expressed concern that China was costing Peru its sovereignty in solidifying control over the South American nation's critical infrastructure, a blunt warning after a Peruvian court ruling restricted a local regulator's oversight of a Chinese-built mega port.\n\nThe $1.3 billion deepwater port in Chancay, north of Peru's capital of Lima, has become a symbol of China's foothold in Latin America and a lightning rod for tensions with Washington.\n\nThe U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said on social media that it was “concerned about latest reports that Peru could be powerless to oversee Chancay, one of its largest ports, which is under the jurisdiction of predatory Chinese owners.\"\n\nIt added: “We support Peru’s sovereign right to oversee critical infrastructure in its own territory. Let this be a cautionary tale for the region and the world: cheap Chinese money costs sovereignty.”\n\nThe concern comes as the Trump administration seeks to assert dominance over the Western Hemisphere, where China has long built influence through massive loans and high trade volumes.\n\nThe Chinese government on Thursday strongly rejected the U.S. comments.\n\n“China firmly opposes and strongly deplores the U.S.’s blatant rumor-mongering and smearing of Chancay port,” said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian at a daily briefing in Beijing.\n\nChancay, along the Pacific coast, is part of Beijing’s Belt and Road initiative, an infrastructure program that has seen Chinese state-owned banks offer sizable loans or financial guarantees to construct seaports, airports and highways, among other projects, across multiple continents.\n\nAs Latin America's deepest port, Chancay is capable of berthing some of the world’s largest cargo ships traveling between Asia and South America. China has been Peru’s biggest trading partner for more than a decade now.\n\nChina’s state-owned shipping and logistics company Cosco, a majority shareholder in the port, dismissed the U.S. claims.\n\nIn response to questions from The Associated Press, it said the court ruling “in no way involves aspects of sovereignty\" and insisted that the port remains \"under the jurisdiction, sovereignty and control of Peruvian authorities, subject to all Peruvian regulations.”\n\nIt added there were plenty of Peruvian authorities monitoring the port's activities, including police forces, environmental regulators and customs officials.\n\nThe ruling issued Jan. 29 by a lower court judge orders Peruvian authorities to refrain from exercising “powers of regulation, supervision, oversight and sanction” over the port in Chancay.\n\nThe regulator, Ositran, which has oversight over all of the country's other major ports, said it would appeal the decision, arguing that there was no reason to exempt Cosco Shipping from the agency's oversight.\n\n“(Cosco Shipping) would be the only company providing services to the public that could not be supervised,\" Verónica Zambrano, president of Ositran, told a local radio station Wednesday.\n\nAlthough it's privately owned, the Chancay Port covers 180 hectares (about 445 acres) of Peruvian territory, Zambrano added, making it subject to government efforts to monitor and enforce compliance with local user protection standards.",

    "fullText": "Bruce Mouat recovered from his Winter Olympics mixed doubles disappointment in some style, delivering an accomplished display to lead his Team GB men's rink to a 9-4 victory in their opening match against China.\n\nLittle more than 24 hours earlier, Mouat and Jen Dodds had faltered in the bronze-medal match in the Cortina Curling Stadium for the second successive Games.\n\nBut the 31-year-old showed why he is considered one of the world's best, as the gold-medal favourites started strongly in their attempt to upgrade the silver they won in Beijing four years ago.\n\nThe Scots, world champions in three of the past five years, traded points with China in the opening two ends, before a classily compiled three in the third cleaved open an advantage that they would never cede.\n\nThey led 5-2 at the break, then a magnificent double take-out and composed closing throw by Mouat extended the advantage to 8-3 after seven.\n\nA judicious set of throws limited the Chinese to one in the eighth but GB closed down the ninth end, taking one to force a round of handshakes with an end to spare.\n\nIt always looked like being a mismatch and so it proved. But a tougher test lies in wait on Thursday, when Mouat and his boys face Sweden - who beat them in the 2022 final - at 13:05 GMT live on the BBC.\n\nHow Team GB is leading the way in curling's arms race\n\n'Don't be afraid of being different, it's your superpower'\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "China told its banks to reduce holdings of US government debt this week, with market pros split on how the move could impact the US and Treasury markets.",
    "fullText": "China instructed banks to dial back their holdings of US Treasury debt this week, a move that sparked fresh conversations about \"Sell America.\"\n\nChinese regulators said the move was related to volatility and concentration risks in US debt, and it wasn't framed specifically as a critique of the dollar-led financial system. Yet, market commentators see it, in part, as an update to a broader geopolitical narrative that's gripped markets in the last year.\n\nBloomberg reported that China's banks collectively hold $298 billion in US dollar-denominated bonds, though is not known much of that is made up of US Treasurys versus things like US corporate debt.\n\nThe impact on treasury yields has been minimal so far, but economists and market pros say the move raises concerns about future knock-on effects.\n\nA senior fellow at the economic policy think tank, Lachman has previously raised concerns about the position of the US as a global economic superpower.\n\nHe said this week that he is deeply concerned about what China's decision may mean for the US, particularly as other nations have already begun shifting away from dollar-denominated assets.\n\n\"[The US] desperately needs foreigners to keep buying US Treasuries to provide that financing, and the last thing that it needs is for foreigners to start selling their Treasurys,\" he told Business Insider, adding that foreign investors hold about 30% of the outstanding amount of US Treasurys.\n\n\"The drying up of foreign buying of our government's bonds could set us up for a bond market and dollar crisis.\"\n\nSetster isn't as concerned about the market implications of China's move. He sees the decision as a reflection of China's need to make changes in order to help stabilize its own economy and guard against volatility from the US after struggling in recent years.\n\n\"Global investors should consequently be paying much more attention to the flows tied to China's currency management,\" he advised. \"Despite the recent warning, my strong suspicion is that Chinese state institutions will struggle to find good alternatives to the Treasury market if they are buying $50 billion or \n\nKedia, an economist at the libertarian think tank, shares Setser's perspective that investors shouldn't regard China's decision as a geopolitical development. He told Business Insider that while he expects China to continue selling off its US Treasurys, it likely won't yield a sizable negative impact for the US.\n\n\"People have a way overestimated opinion of how much value of US government debt China actually holds,\" he stated. \"The value isn't anywhere near enough to crash our markets or anything like that.\"\n\nKedia acknowledged that a massive offloading of government bonds would likely impact the market, but he added that he doesn't see that as likely\n\nRen, who serves as director of modern alpha at asset manager WisdomTree, sees it as more explicitly geopolitical than other commentators.\n\n\"The move is largely geopolitical, with financial factors secondary,\" she said. \"China uses US treasury holdings for part of its currency management, making rapid liquidation unlikely. While near-term risks remain low, preparations for potential regional conflict involving Japan or the Taiwan Strait are reinforcing incentives on both sides to reduce financial dependence.\"\n\nIn her view, China isn't likely to be a net buyer of US government debt until the two nations reach an equilibrium.\n\nThe market research firm's chief China strategist thinks the regulatory guidance is mostly about risk management. That said, he thinks geopolitical tensions are a factor in China's decision as well.\n\n\"China has been reducing its holdings of US assets—particularly Treasurys—in recent years, and the pace has accelerated sharply since Russia's invasion of Ukraine,\" he said. \"Beijing's core strategic objective is to reduce its vulnerability to potential US sanctions under conditions of severe geopolitical stress.\"\n\nLike Kedia, Wang expects China to continue selling its holdings of US government debt. He claims that US Treasurys account for roughly 20% of China's reserves, likely above the comfort level of its government.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — In China, consumerism appears to outweigh nationalism regardless of how testy relations have become in recent diplomatic spats with countries like Japan and the United States.\n\nIt has been common practice for the ruling Communist Party to whip up nationalist sentiment and deploy propaganda condemning countries deemed to be violating China's stance on territorial issues as Taiwan and Tibet. At times, Beijing targets companies that make ideological missteps in their maps or advertising.\n\nIn the past, friction with Japan and the United States has led to calls for mass boycotts, protests in the streets or even vandalism on embassies or restaurants. These days, pure nationalism appears not to resonate so much with Chinese consumers accustomed to making their own personal consumption choices.\n\n“Chinese consumers, especially urban middle-class and younger demographics, are not making everyday purchasing decisions based on nationalism,” said Jacob Cooke, CEO of Beijing-based consultancy WPIC Marketing + Technologies.\n\nJapan still sells despite tensions\n\nBeijing reacted with outrage to Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's comment, not long after she took office in October, that an attack on Taiwan, the self-ruled island China claims as its territory, might require a military intervention by Tokyo.\n\nChinese officials have condemned the remark and moved to restrict some trade with Japan. Warnings to Chinese travelers not to visit Japan, an ultra-popular destination, have had a notable impact on its tourism industry.\n\nBe that as it may, huge crowds turned up to the opening of an outlet of Sushiro at a Shanghai mall in December.\n\nThe Japan-based conveyor-belt sushi chain has become a smash success since it opened its first branch in mainland China in 2021.\n\n“It tastes good,” said Edith Xiao, a 23-year-old university student who lined up outside a Sushiro restaurant in a Beijing mall for more than half an hour to get in. “The quality of the ingredients is guaranteed.”\n\nXiao is also a fan of the Japanese manga and anime series Chiikawa, whose cherubic, hamster-like cartoon character is popular among Chinese.\n\nThe broader state of China-Japan relations has had little impact on her own consumption of Japanese culture or restaurants, she said.\n\n“It’s just statements made by leaders. It doesn’t represent a change in the attitude of people of the country,” she explained.\n\nAmerican culture appeals to Chinese consumers\n\nTensions between the Chinese and U.S. governments over tariffs, Taiwan and other issues also don’t appear to be causing Chinese to punish American brands.\n\nDisney’s Zootopia 2 is a huge hit in China, where its fans, many in cosplay of its characters, helped make it one of the biggest global cinematic hits of 2025.\n\nIt became the highest grossing Hollywood film in China on record with more than 4.4 billion yuan ($634 million) in revenue, according to Chinese entertainment data provider Beacon Pro.\n\nDespite a government push to promote and subsidize homegrown movies to make China a “strong film power” by 2035, Chinese film-goers say they welcome an escape into foreign cinematics.\n\nZootopia 2 was a light-hearted option, said Ruan Wenlin, who watched the movie in Beijing. “It was so hilarious,” she said.\n\nMany Chinese consumers are “tired, exhausted and anxious from COVID and from the weak economy,” said Shaun Rein, managing director at China Market Research Group. “People are watching Hollywood movies, especially cartoons like Zootopia, because they’re stressed out and just want something to relax themselves,” he said.\n\nRalph Lauren, the New York-based fashion brand, meanwhile has been building on its “old money” and quiet luxury aesthetic to win favor with urban middle-class Chinese who are prioritizing quality and value over nationalism, analysts say.\n\nAmerican fashions appeal to many, despite often fraught relations between Beijing and Washington. Ralph Lauren’s sales have grown faster in China than in Europe or North America.\n\n“What attracts me most is its stable brand image and design,” said Zhang Tianyu, who was shopping recently at a Ralph Lauren outlet in Beijing.\n\nAmerican brands that are succeeding are doing so because they genuinely meet consumer needs or represent a lifestyle Chinese consumers want to associate with, not because of country-of-origin alone, said Cooke from WPIC Marketing + Technologies.\n\nEvolving patterns as ‘patriotic buying’ trend shifts\n\nAs a wave of patriotic buying of Chinese brands — dubbed “guochao,” or national tide in Chinese — has evolved and matured, many consumers have grown comfortable with both foreign and domestic brands.\n\n“Chinese (people) have stopped buying just for the sake of buying Chinese brands,\" said Rein from China Market Research Group. Consumers are “scared about the economy, they’re anxious about their job prospects. So they’ll just buy whatever brand, domestic, Chinese or foreign, fits their definition of value and lifestyle,” he said.\n\nCompared with a decade ago, nationalist sentiment has less influence on consumer behavior, analysts said.\n\nIn 2012, Chinese crowds gathered for anti-Japan protests over a territorial dispute, smashed Japanese brand cars and vandalized Japanese restaurants. There were calls to shun Japanese goods.\n\nLikewise in 2021, Western brands including Nike were hit with boycotts in China due to disputes over political issues such as Beijing's treatment of members of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, in the country's far west.\n\nMore recently, controversies like a Pokemon card game event that was originally planned to be held at a shrine to honor Japan’s war dead still triggered angry comments on Chinese social media, but no obvious broader repercussions.\n\n“We may believe that all Chinese consumers should follow Beijing’s direction of discarding foreign influence, which is misleading,” said Yaling Jiang, an independent Chinese consumer analyst. “Geopolitics does not dictate business flows on the local level.”\n\nShoppers often will just mix and match to suit their own tastes, Jiang said.\n\nThe ascent of strong Chinese brands has emerged as a key challenge for foreign companies. From electric vehicles to smart phones to athletic wear, local companies are fast gaining market share both at home and abroad.\n\n“Chinese will choose Chinese brands because they’re better, better value, better quality, better pricing,” said Rein.\n\nAfter the government declared that travelers should avoid trips to Japan, employees of state-owned companies and government agencies, as well as travel agencies, fell in line. Hundreds of flights operated by China’s major state-owned airlines, and Japan-bound group tours, were cancelled.\n\nThe number of Chinese visitors to Japan fell 45% in December from a year earlier, to about 330,400. Many Chinese are still traveling to Japan individually, despite earlier warnings from officials, often while keeping a low-profile on social media.\n\nAP’s Beijing newsroom contributed to this story.",

Japan has QZSS (Quasi-Zenith Satellite System), commonly known as Michibiki. But there's one system that matters more than people realize: China's BeiDou isn't just a GPS alternative, it's a fast-growing platform with uses that go far beyond navigation.\n\nThe first BeiDou satellites launched in 2000, and by 2020, it had achieved global coverage. Just like America's GPS, BeiDou is owned and operated by its home government, and the ruling Chinese Communist Party has kept most of its technological specifications secret. However, BeiDou has caught the attention of other governments, particularly the United States, due to its wide-ranging uses. BeiDou does a lot more than guide people on their way to work. Just as GPS is closely tied into the American military, BeiDou is becoming ingrained in China's military operations, used by guided missiles and bombs. It's also being used for monitoring and responding to natural disasters. BeiDou is already more advanced than GPS in many ways, and it's grown at a stunning pace.\n\nBeiDou is much younger than GPS, which first launched in 1978 and achieved full coverage in 1993. However, the Chinese government has pursued progress on its GNSS much more aggressively than the United States. BeiDou was born with a competitive spirit, as part of a push to bolster China's military wing, the People's Liberation Army, at the end of the last century.\n\nA defining moment for China's GNSS ambitions came amidst the 1996 Taiwan Strait missile crisis, when tensions between the Chinese and Taiwanese governments led to the PLA conducting a series of missile tests in the East China Sea. During one of the tests, the Chinese missiles missed their targets badly. They had been relying on a GPS signal that went out, and Chinese officials later suggested the signal had been disrupted. The CCP resolved at that moment to develop a GNSS independent of, and superior to, the Americans'. From the beginning, national defense, and particularly missile guidance, was at the forefront of BeiDou.\n\nSince the 2010s, BeiDou has played a major role in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a massive infrastructure project aimed at expanding trade routes across the Eastern Hemisphere. In the process, China has begun heavily promoting BeiDou on the international scale. Their partnership with the military of Pakistan in 2018 drew particular attention. Amidst a steady air of tension between Beijing and Washington, China's ability to fortify its allies' militaries will have immense geopolitical consequences in any form of conflict.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States has been steadily rolling out GPS III. It will be an upgrade over the currently available GPS system, but it will probably still fall short of BeiDou on most fronts. GPS III will add more satellites to the GPS constellation, but the new satellites are only an incremental upgrade over what's already in use. In fact, GPS III was originally intended to launch in 2014, so the system is already outdated in some ways — and the first satellites for its planned successor, GPS IIIF, aren't scheduled to launch until Spring 2027.\n\nBeiDou has raised alarms within the U.S. government amidst a tight competition with Beijing for tech superiority that has already shown the Chinese can outmatch our drone technology. Perhaps the most concerning comment about BeiDou came from within the U.S. government itself, in a memo from former Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen from 2023, which plainly said, \"GPS's capabilities are now substantially inferior to those of China's BeiDou.\"\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "title": "China sentences Hong Kong media mogul Jimmy Lai to 20 years in prison",
    "description": "Family of Jimmy Lai, a Hong Kong media tycoon and vocal critic of China's Communist rule, calls his prison sentence cruel, and the \"end of justice.\"",
    "fullText": "Hong Kong — Jimmy Lai, the pro-democracy former Hong Kong media tycoon and a fierce critic of Beijing, was sentenced on Monday to 20 years in prison in the longest punishment given so far under a China-imposed national security law that has virtually silenced the city's dissent.\n\n Lai, 78, was convicted in December of conspiring with others to collude with foreign forces to endanger national security, and conspiracy to publish seditious articles. The maximum penalty for his conviction was life imprisonment.\n\n His co-defendants, six former employees of his Apple Daily newspaper and two activists, received prison terms of between 6 years and 3 months, and 10 years on collusion-related charges.\n\n Lai smiled and waved at his supporters when he arrived for the sentence. But before he left the courtroom, he looked serious, as some people in the public gallery cried. When asked about whether they would appeal, his lawyer Robert Pang said no comment.\n\n The democracy advocate's arrest and trial have raised concerns about the decline of press freedom in what was once an Asian bastion of media independence. The government insists the case has nothing to do with a free press, saying the defendants used news reporting as a pretext for years to commit acts that harmed China and Hong Kong.\n\n Lai was one of the first prominent figures to be arrested under the security law in 2020. Within a year, some of Apple Daily's senior journalists also were arrested and the newspaper shut down in June 2021.\n\nFamily warns Lai \"will die a martyr behind bars\"\n\nIn a statement, Lai's son, Sebastien, said the \"draconian\" prison term was devastating for his family and life-threatening for his father. \"It signifies the total destruction of the Hong Kong legal system and the end of justice,\" he said.\n\nHis sister Claire called the sentence \"heartbreakingly cruel\" in the same statement. \"If this sentence is carried out, he will die a martyr behind bars,\" she said.\n\nLai has been in custody for more than five years already.\n\nIn January, his lawyer Pang said Lai suffered health issues including heart palpitations, high blood pressure and diabetes.\n\nThe prosecution said a medical report noted Lai's general health condition remained stable. The government claimed Lai had requested to be held in solitary confinement.\n\nLai's sentence condemned around the world\n\nLai's sentencing could heighten Beijing's diplomatic tension with foreign governments, which have criticized Lai's conviction and sentencing.\n\n President Trump, who is expected to visit China in April, said in December that he felt \"so badly\" after the verdict was handed down, and he noted that he had spoken with Chinese leader Xi Jinping about Lai and asked him \"to consider his release.\"\n\nIn a statement shared by the State Department on Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the sentence \"an unjust and tragic conclusion to this case.\"\n\n\"It shows the world that Beijing will go to extraordinary lengths to silence those who advocate fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong,\" Rubio said, adding that \"after enduring a trial lasting two years, and detention in prison for more than five, Mr. Lai and his family have suffered enough. The United States urges the authorities to grant Mr. Lai humanitarian parole.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government also has called for the release of Lai, who is a British citizen. U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper called the prosecution \"politically motivated,\" saying the prison term is tantamount to a life sentence.\n\nHuman Rights Watch's Asia Director Elaine Pearson said the harsh 20-year-sentence is effectively a death sentence, calling it cruel and unjust.\n\nChinese leaders say Lai's sentence \"deeply gratifying\"\n\nHong Kong leader John Lee said Lai's sentence demonstrated the rule of law, calling the crimes he was convicted of \"heinous and evil in the extreme.\"\n\n The newspaper mogul's \"heavy sentence of 20 years' imprisonment demonstrates the rule of law, upholds justice and is deeply gratifying,\" Lee said in a statement.\n\nLin Jian, a spokesperson for China's foreign ministry in Beijing, said Lai was \"a key planner and participant in a series of anti-China and disruptive activities in Hong Kong,\" and lauded the sentencing as \"reasonable, legitimate, and legal,\" adding: \"There is no room for argument.\"\n\nLin urged \"relevant countries\" to respect the rule of law in Hong Kong.\n\nLai prosecuted under China's broad new security law\n\nLai founded Apple Daily, a now-defunct newspaper known for its critical reports against the governments in Hong Kong and Beijing. He was arrested in August 2020 under the security law that was used in a yearslong crackdown on many of Hong Kong's leading activists.\n\n In their ruling, three government-vetted judges wrote that the starting point of Lai's sentence was increased because they found him to be the mastermind of the conspiracies. But they also reduced his penalty because they accepted that Lai's age, health condition and solitary confinement would cause his prison life to be more burdensome than that of other inmates.\n\n \"Lai was no doubt the mastermind of all three conspiracies charged and therefore he warrants a heavier sentence,\" they said. \"As regards the others, it is difficult to distinguish their relative culpability.\"\n\n They took into account that Lai is serving a prison term of five years and nine months in a separate fraud case and ruled that 18 years of Lai's sentence in the security case should be served consecutively to that prison term.\n\nA chilling effect on China's journalists and academics\n\nUrania Chiu, lecturer in law at Oxford Brookes University, said the case is significant for its broad construction of seditious intent and application of the term \"collusion with foreign forces\" to certain activities by the media. The implication is particularly alarming for journalists and those working in academia, she said.\n\n \"Offering and publishing legitimate critiques of the state, which often involves engagement with international platforms and audiences, may now easily be construed as 'collusion,'\" Chiu said.\n\n The former Apple Daily staffers and activists involved in Lai's case entered guilty pleas, which helped reduce their sentences Monday. They earlier admitted to the prosecution charge that said they conspired with Lai to request foreign forces to impose sanctions or blockades, or engage in other hostile activities against Hong Kong or China.\n\n The convicted journalists are publisher Cheung Kim-hung, associate publisher Chan Pui-man, editor-in-chief Ryan Law, executive editor-in-chief Lam Man-chung, executive editor-in-chief responsible for English news Fung Wai-kong and editorial writer Yeung Ching-kee. They received prison terms ranging between six years and nine months, to 10 years.\n\n The two activists, Andy Li and Chan Tsz-wah, were sentenced to six years and three months, and seven years and three months respectively.\n\n The penalties for Cheung, Chan and Yeung, alongside the two activists, were reduced in part because they served as prosecution witnesses and the judges said their evidence had \"significantly\" contributed to the conviction of Lai.\n\n Before sunrise, dozens of people stood in line outside the court building to secure a seat in the courtroom. One of them was former Apple Daily employee Tammy Cheung.\n\n \"Whatever happens, it's an end — at least we'll know the outcome,\" Cheung said before the sentence was delivered.\n\n Lai founded Apple Daily in 1995, two years before the former British colony returned to Chinese rule. Its closure in 2021 shocked the local press scene. Hong Kong ranked 140th out of 180 territories in the press-freedom index compiled by media freedom organization Reporters Without Borders in 2025, far from its 18th place in 2002.\n\nOlympic skier Lindsey Vonn crashes seconds into race\n\nShock over Lindsey Vonn's Olympic crash; Trump calls Hunter Hess a loser for comments on politics\n\nMore details emerge on whistleblower complaint against Tulsi Gabbard",

    "fullText": "Regulators in China want banks to dial back their holdings of US Treasury bonds.\n\nThe move, reported by Bloomberg on Monday, is likely to fuel fresh talk about the \"sell America\" trade and the appeal of the dollar. Chinese authorities cited concentration risk and volatility in US debt markets as the reasons for scaling back.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Chinese banks have been urged to limit new purchases, while those with high exposure have been told to dial back their investments.\n\nTreasury yields, which move inversely to prices, were slightly higher on Monday morning. The dollar dropped more sharply, with the Dollar Index down almost 1% on the news. The fresh dip in the greenback follows its recent decline to four-year lows.\n\nWhile the report notes that the regulators framed the directive around financial stability, rather than geopolitical maneuvering, it's likely to spur more debate in the market about countries' willingness to keep lending to the US.\n\nThe \"sell America\" trade, in which investors dump dollar-denominated assets from stocks to Treasurys, was a focal point of markets last year. It's been fueled by a combination of fiscal concerns amid record-high US debt and deficit spending, as well as weaker trust in US institutions amid threats to central bank independence and ongoing tariff threats. It's also been a force behind the debasement trade, which has boosted gold and other metals in the last year.\n\nBloomberg added that regulators did not specify how much exposure they believe Chinese banks should have to US debt at this time.\n\nData from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange shows that as of September 2025, Chinese banks collectively held $298 billion in US dollar-denominated bonds, but it's not clear how much of that is US Treasury debt.\n\nDonald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke by phone last week, and could meet in Beijing in April.",

    "fullText": "LIVIGNO, Italy (AP) — Chloe Kim and Eileen Gu, two Olympic standouts who have faced their share of hate over the years, each weighed in Monday on Donald Trump's bashing of their friend, American freeskier Hunter Hess, for having said he didn't back the U.S. president's heightened crackdown on immigrants.\n\n“I think in moments like these, it is really important for us to unite and kind of stand up for one another for all that’s going on,\" said Kim, the two-time Olympic gold medalist whose parents are South Korean immigrants and who has faced racism throughout her career for her Asian heritage.\n\nGu, the American-born freeskier who competes for China, said after her silver-medal win in slopestyle that she had been in touch with Hess, who told her she was one of the few people who could relate to what he's going through.\n\n“As someone who’s been caught in the crossfire before, I feel sorry for the athletes,” said Gu, who was born in San Francisco and whose decision to compete for China turned her into a lightning rod.\n\nHess drew Trump’s ire when he was asked by reporters to give his views on the immigration crackdown that has claimed the lives of two protestors in Minnesota and disrupted thousands of lives of immigrants and U.S. citizens. Hess answered: “Just because I’m wearing the flag doesn’t mean I represent everything that’s going on in the U.S.”\n\nThe next day, Trump lashed out at Hess on his Truth Social account, calling him “a real Loser” and saying he would be hard pressed to root for him at the Games. Hess's friends — snowboarders and freeskiers competing this week in Livigno — were asked for their reaction.\n\n“My parents being immigrants from Korea, this one definitely hits pretty close to home,” said Kim, who begins defense of her title Wednesday.\n\n\"I’m really proud to represent the United States,” she said. “The U.S. has given my family and I so much opportunity, but I also think that we are allowed to voice our opinions of what’s going that we need to lead with love and compassion.”\n\nOther American snowboarders spoke out for diversity and the right of expression.\n\n“I think there are a lot of different opinions in the U.S. right now. Obviously we’re very divided,” snowboarder Bea Kim said. “I personally am very proud to represent the United States. That being said, I think diversity is what makes us a very strong country and what makes that so special.”\n\nTeammate Maddie Mastro added: “I’m also saddened with what’s happening at home.\"\n\n“It’s really tough and I feel like we can’t turn a blind eye to that. But at the same time, I represent a country that has the same values as mine of kindness and compassion. And we come together in times of injustice,” Mastro said.\n\nGu called it “an unwinnable press war” for Hess and lamented the fact that the controversy could be a distraction for the athletes, and overshadow the beauty of the biggest event in winter sports.\n\n“I’m sorry that the headline that is eclipsing the Olympics has to be something so ... unrelated to the spirit of the Games,\" she said. \"It really runs contrary to everything that the Olympics should be.”\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "He has been jailed, tracked and threatened by China’s government. What was it like pay a visit home? As he publishes a polemic about surveillance and state control, the artist relives a momentous trip to see his mother\n\nAi Weiwei is talking me through the decision-making process before his first visit to China in over a decade. The artist, known around the world as the most famous critic of the Chinese communist regime, had to do some fraught arithmetic before deciding to head back home.\n\nBefore boarding a flight with his son, who had never met the artist’s elderly mother, Ai thought back to his time in detention when his captors told him he would spend the next 13 years in custody on bogus charges: “They said, ‘When you come out, your son won’t recognise you.’ That was very heavy and really the only moment that touched me.”\n\nHe ended up spending several months in captivity. Lao, his son, is now 17. Ai says Lao doesn’t really need his guidance any more so he decided to book their flights and roll the dice. “People said, ‘Are you scared?’ I said, ‘No, why should I be scared?’ I’m Chinese. I have a Chinese passport. I’m entitled to go back and see my mum. So I went back.”\n\nWelcome to the life of Ai Weiwei. For most people, returning home doesn’t involve weighing up the risk of whether you’ll see close family ever again, but that’s the reality for a 68-year-old whose whole existence has been shaped by authoritarianism and the struggle against it.\n\nHis trip to China went well. He ended up being interviewed at the airport and released after a couple of hours into a country whose smells, sights and sounds were soothing to him. Ai described the journey as being like “a phone call suddenly reconnecting”. Today, he’s more poetic, describing it as “a piece of jade broken that you can put back together because it matches very well. Everything’s so familiar: the light, the temperature, the people.”\n\nAi is meeting me in the London offices of his publisher to talk about his new book, On Censorship, a 90-page polemic on the nature of state control, AI and surveillance. The man certainly knows about these things. Born in Beijing in 1957, he grew up in labour camps in north-west China following the exile of his father, the poet Ai Qing. In 2011, he was detained for 81 days in a 170 sq ft windowless prison because of his own activism. Upon his release, he was tracked, interrogated and threatened by the Chinese state; then his passport was returned in 2015 and he began a life in exile. He currently divides his time between Lisbon, Berlin and Cambridge.\n\nHis artworks are as dramatic as his backstory. An army of 1,600 Chinese artisans created 100m hand-painted porcelain “seeds” that were scattered over the floor of Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall in London 16 years ago. He cloaked Berlin’s Konzerthaus in 14,000 fluorescent orange lifejackets worn by refugees; and made a film dedicated to the children who died in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. That direct challenge to the official state narrative made him “the most dangerous person in China”.\n\nHis upcoming work, at Aviva Studios in Manchester, involves 30 tonnes of buttons, which were saved from a London factory that was closing down and smuggled into China to be turned into huge hanging artworks by craftspeople.\n\nThe book is a startling read, arguing that those in the west misunderstand the nature of censorship. He defines it as “the exercise of power over intellectual space”, both “an indispensable tool of mental enslavement and a fundamental source of political corruption”. It is not just authoritarian regimes, he warns. Liberal societies think that censorship is rare, “but people forget that even on sunny days, shadows are inevitable”.\n\nSome of the arguments are perplexing. In a section about the limitations of AI, the artist refers to the selfie he took with AfD leader Alice Weidel in 2018. He says AI decided that the image, which is real, must have been fake because the pair seemed to be on opposite ends of the political spectrum. At the time of the selfie, Weidel, whose grandfather was a Nazi, was considered to be in the more moderate wing of the far-right party, but since becoming leader has called for “large-scale repatriations” of foreigners, saying the country’s focus on the Holocaust is akin to a “guilt cult”.\n\nDoes Ai regret the selfie? He tells me that on many issues, her political demands “could be wrong”, but she’s still “more rational than other political opponents in Germany”. What about her anti-immigrant rhetoric – isn’t that anathema to him? “Some states don’t even accept one [immigrant] and Germany accepts 1.2 million, which is a pretty generous decision,” he replies. “So if they change the policy and they want to limit it, then there is nothing wrong.”\n\nHe’s also impressed by the fact that Weidel “openly wants Germany to be more independent from American influence”. He adds: “I think those are some of the things that we need to do.” Those who know German politics would find that argument surprising because the AfD are seen as the party who are closest to Trump and nearly all parties in the country want more independence from the US. A ringing endorsement of someone at the outermost reaches of far-right European politics might cause a few double takes, and there are more surprises.\n\nAi’s attitude to China has shifted dramatically. The nation, he said recently, is “in an upward phase,” pointing to the technological advancements made and increased personal freedoms. The west, however, struggles to “sustain its own logic”, has lost its “ethical authority” and has “descended into something barely recognisable”.\n\nAlthough a quick glance across the Atlantic at America in the age of ICE raids does somewhat make his point, he means Europe, too. So is the Chinese regime’s most famous critic now toeing the party line? “My position with China started before I could recognise myself as an individual. I grew up in this black hole with my father,” he says, pointing to a picture on his iPhone of a desolate location in north-west China.\n\nHe’s not angry exactly, but the suggestion that he’s softened on the Chinese government has touched a nerve. “I still have a Chinese passport. My mum is still Chinese. So that’s my only relationship to China,” he says. “I’m not nostalgic. I’m not patriotic.” What about the claim that the west embraces censorship? Is that his experience in the UK? “I cannot get into details,” he says cryptically. “But I feel the same kind of surveillance, same kind of censorship in the west.”\n\nPressed for an example, he tells me a story about the Royal Academy in London, an institution that gave him a landmark exhibition in 2015 and made him an honorary member in 2011 following his detainment in China. In November 2023, an exhibition of new works to be shown at the Lisson Gallery was pulled after he posted a tweet that began: “The sense of guilt around the persecution of the Jewish people has been, at times, transferred to offset the Arab world.” The tweet was deleted, with the artist telling journalists his show had “effectively [been] cancelled”.\n\nIn the aftermath, a vote was then held at the RA to determine whether his membership should be revoked because of accusations that the post was antisemitic. “I don’t have the intention of an antisemite. My best friends, they’re all Jewish people,” says Ai. “I tweeted millions of tweets on Twitter, but [how is it that] this tweet can cause such trouble? Then they said the procedure is to let the Academicians vote.”\n\nHis peers supported him and he won the vote. Ai was then asked to write an article about freedom of speech for the RA’s magazine, which he did, arguing: “Speaking the truth and insisting on one’s own perspective is dangerous and may come at a heavy price. Books may go unpublished, exhibitions may be closed, concerts cancelled.”\n\nAfter he sent it, there was silence. Then he says the RA claimed they didn’t have room to run the piece. For him, this is the censorship in the west, which he argues in On Censorship can be “more covert, more deceptive and more corrosive” than in authoritarian regimes. “I have several cases like this,” Ai adds. “Happens in Britain and in Germany.”\n\nThe RA disputes this account, claiming the decision to drop the piece was made before Ai submitted it. A spokesperson added: “Plurality of voices, tolerance and free thinking are at the core of what we stand for and seek to protect.”\n\nI wonder how Ai feels about the world in 2026. His new book paints it as a place without refuge for those who value self-expression and freedom of speech. “I think today we are living in a complicated world, where life is more like a shattered mirror,” he says. “It reflects the reality, but the reality can be a broken reality.”\n\nDid his trip to China restore his faith in humanity? There’s a pause. “If we were in the time of the Tang dynasty, someone like me would go back and write beautiful poetry,” he says, smiling. “But not today. I just take a few selfies.”",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOne of the most well-known athletes at the 2026 Winter Olympics is a ski star competing for China.\n\nEileen Gu, though, wasn't born in China. She was born in the United States. It draws extra attention to her moves on the slopes, including during Monday's slopestyle competition.\n\nHer worldwide popularity due to her early fame and social media stardom only shines an additional light on her every move.\n\nGu got her Olympics competition underway Saturday in Italy when she finished second in the qualifying round of the women's slopestyle competition.\n\nShe'll have plenty more time in the spotlight before these Olympics are through.\n\nMORE: Amber Glenn has the most surprising interest at the Olympics\n\nGu made her decision to compete for China when she was 15 years old in 2022, and she did it for representation reasons.\n\n“The U.S. already has the representation,” Gu has said in the past about popularity of women's skiiers in the United States. “I like building my own pond.”\n\nAdding a bit to the controversy was that Gu had already competed for Team USA during three slopestyle World Cup events before she made the switch.\n\nShe wrote at the time that it was a \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to help to promote the sport I love.\"\n\nMORE: Breezy Johnson won a gold medal for the U.S., and then she broke it\n\nGu then captured all the headlines while landing a double cork 1620 in the big air competition to claim the gold medal.\n\n“My whole thing was, it’s all upside,” recalls Gu. “Because if I land, I will win the Olympics. If I don’t land, then I get to make history as the first person to ever try this trick in such a situation. It’s a decision that I would be super proud of and live with forever.”\n\nShe'll be trying to add more medals to her collection at these Olympics. And she'll have plenty of people watching.\n\nThis U.S. luge star was parodied on SNL\n\nNBC's drone cameras have everyone's attention\n\nThe Winter Olympics mascots are adorable\n\nThe Olympics reason Ilia Malinin doesn't have a girlfriend\n\nThis is what Russia's Olympic hockey roster would've looked like\n\nHow Laila Edwards is making U.S. women's hockey history",

    "description": "The US accused China of secret nuclear tests, banned under international agreement, that were building toward tests of larger nuclear warheads.",
    "fullText": "The US accused China of secret nuclear explosive testing and attempting to cover it up, an official said Friday.\n\nBanned for decades under an international agreement to which China and the US are signatories, nuclear explosive testing involves the detonation of warheads. The US accusation comes on the heels of the expiration of the nuclear arms control New START agreement between the US and Russia, which limited their numbers of deployed warheads and launchers.\n\n\"I can reveal that the US government is aware that China has conducted nuclear explosive tests, including preparing for tests with designated yields in the hundreds of tons,\" US Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Thomas DiNanno said in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nDiNanno added that Beijing had used \"decoupling — a method to decrease the effectiveness of seismic monitoring — to hide its activities from the world,\" and said one such test had occurred on June 22, 2020. Decoupling refers to muffling the seismic signal of an underground nuclear test.\n\nA spokesperson for China's embassy in the US told Business Insider that Beijing is \"committed to peaceful development, follows a policy of 'no first use' of nuclear weapons, and a nuclear strategy that focuses on self-defense and adheres to its nuclear testing moratorium.\" The spokesperson added China is ready to work with other countries to uphold the agreement.\n\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, adopted in 1996, banned the live tests that have occurred for decades and contributed to nuclear scares and radioactive exposure. The last such test conducted by the US was in 1992, and China's most recent occurred in 1996. The only publicly known explosive testing this century has been by North Korea. The US, Russia, and China have signed the treaty but haven't ratified it, unlike nearly 180 other countries.\n\nCurrent testing practices rely on modeling, simulation, and subcritical testing, which officials have said are vigorous and dependable. Last year, US President Donald Trump raised concerns with vague comments on resuming nuclear testing in response to other countries.\n\n\"They seem to all be nuclear testing. We have more nuclear weapons than anybody. We don't do testing, and we've halted it years, many years ago. But with others doing testing, I think it's appropriate that we do also,\" the president said.\n\nThere's been some suspicion that US rivals have been preparing for testing, including work spotted at the Lop Nur and Novaya Zemlya nuclear sites in China and Russia, respectively.\n\nBut in response to DiNanno's comments, Robert Floyd, executive secretary of the CTBTO, said the organization's monitoring system \"did not detect any event consistent with the characteristics of a nuclear weapon test explosion at that time. Subsequent, more detailed analyses has not altered that determination.\"\n\nJust a day before DiNanno's comments, the New START agreement binding the US and Russia to a number of operational nuclear weapons and launchers, as well as a verification process and open communication, expired. Whether Washington and Beijing will continue to observe the treaty or attempt a new agreement remains unclear.\n\nThe Trump administration has said a new nuclear arms deal would need to account for the growth of China's nuclear weapons stockpile, which the Pentagon has assessed will top 1,000 by 2030. \"And as we sit here today, China's entire nuclear arsenal has no limits, no transparency, no declarations, and no controls,\" DiNanno said, adding that a post-New START treaty will address both Russia's vast arsenal and China's nuclear rise.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Intel and AMD have notified Chinese customers of supply shortages for server central processing units (CPUs), with Intel warning of delivery lead times of up to six months, people with knowledge of the delays said.\n\nThe supply ​constraints have driven up prices for Intel's server products in China by more than 10% generally, although pricing varies by ‌customer contract, according to one of the people.\n\nBooming investment in artificial intelligence infrastructure has created a frantic rush not only for AI-specific chips, but also other parts of ‌the supply chain - most acutely in memory chips, prices of which continue to soar.\n\nThese latest notices to Chinese customers, which the sources said were made in recent weeks, indicate that CPU shortages have also intensified. That could compound challenges for AI companies as well as many other manufacturers.\n\nIn China, which accounts for more than 20% of Intel's overall revenue, its fourth- and fifth-generation Xeon CPUs are in particularly short supply, ⁠with Intel rationing deliveries, two of the people ‌said.\n\nIntel has a substantial backlog of unfulfilled orders for these models, with delivery times extending as long as six months, they added.\n\nAMD has also informed clients of supply constraints, said one of the people and a ‍third source. Delivery lead times for some AMD products have been pushed out to eight to 10 weeks, the third source said.\n\nThe extent of the supply contraints in China is being reported by Reuters for the first time.\n\nIntel, which flagged CPU supply constraints in its earnings call in January, said in a ​statement to Reuters that the rapid adoption of AI had led to strong demand for \"traditional compute\".\n\nThe company expects \"inventory at lowest level in ‌Q1, but we are addressing aggressively and expect supply improvement in Q2 through 2026,\" the statement said.\n\nAMD reiterated remarks in its earnings call that it has boosted its supply capabilities to cope with strong demand.\n\n\"We remain confident in our ability to meet customer demand globally based on our strong supplier agreements and supply chain, including our partnership with TSMC,\" it said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nThe two companies together dominate the global server CPU market. Intel has seen its market share decline from over 90% in 2019 to about ⁠60% in 2025, while AMD's share has climbed from around 5% in 2019 ​to more than 20% last year, according to a UBS report in January.",

    "fullText": "A CORUNA, Spain, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Around a third of countries attending a military AI summit agreed on Thursday to a a declaration ​on how to govern deployment of the technology in warfare, but military ‌heavyweights China and the U.S. opted out.\n\nTensions in relations between the United States and European allies, and uncertainty ‌over how transatlantic ties will look in coming months and years, made some countries hesitant to sign joint agreements, several attendees and delegates said.\n\nThe pledge underscores growing concern among some governments that rapid advances in artificial intelligence could outpace rules around its military use, raising the ⁠risk of accidents, miscalculation or ‌unintended escalation.\n\nGovernments are facing a \"prisoner's dilemma\", caught between putting responsible restrictions in place and not wanting to limit themselves in comparison with adversaries, ‍said Dutch Defence Minister Ruben Brekelmans.\n\n\"Russia and China are moving very fast. That creates urgency to make progress in developing AI. But seeing it going fast also increases the urgency to keep ​working on its responsible use. The two go hand-in-hand,\" he said in comments to ‌Reuters.\n\nOnly 35 countries out of 85 attending the Responsible AI in the Military Domain (REAIM) summit in A Coruna, Spain, on signed a commitment to 20 principles on AI on Thursday.\n\nThese included affirming human responsibility over AI-powered weapons, encouraging clear chains of command and control, and sharing information on national oversight arrangements \"where consistent with national security\".\n\nThe document also outlined the ⁠importance of risk assessments, robust testing and training ​and education for personnel operating military AI capabilities.\n\nAt two ​prior military AI summits in The Hague and Seoul in 2023 and 2024 respectively, around 60 nations, excluding China but including the United States, ‍endorsed a modest \"blueprint ⁠for action\" without legal commitment.\n\nWhile this year's document was also non-binding, some were still uncomfortable with the idea of endorsing more concrete policies, said Yasmin Afina, a ⁠researcher at the U.N. Institute for Disarmament Research, an adviser on the process.\n\nMajor signatories on Thursday included ‌Canada, Germany, France, Britain, the Netherlands, South Korea and Ukraine.",

    "description": "Device small enough to be mounted on trucks, aircraft, or even satellites",
    "fullText": "Chinese scientists have developed a compact ultra-powerful energy generator, paving the way for next-generation weapons that could one day be turned on satellite swarms like SpaceX’s Starlink constellation.\n\nHigh-power microwave weapons have gained traction in recent years as a low-cost alternative to missiles and guns due to their near-unlimited firing capacity.\n\nResearchers in the US, Russia, and China in particular have all been investigating whether the technology could be developed into directed-energy weapons that can disrupt satellites.\n\nDestroying a satellite in space is a messy business, with conventional weapons likely to create large amounts of orbiting debris that can have unpredictable consequences, including for a nation’s own satellites.\n\nIn theory at least, microwave weapons could disable a satellite with the creation of minimal debris and allow for plausible deniability, making them strategically advantageous.\n\nThese weapons operate by storing electrical energy and releasing it all at once in a powerful pulse – similar to a Tesla coil.\n\nThe massive power spike they are capable of producing can run microwave generators, which in turn can be used to disrupt electronics.\n\nUntil now most prototypes for these pulse generators have been large, measuring at least 10 metres long and weighing over 10 tons, making them difficult to install in smaller weapons systems.\n\nIn a new study, Chinese scientists from the Northwest Institute of Nuclear Technology (NINT) used a special liquid insulating material, dubbed “Midel 7131”, to achieve higher energy storage density, stronger insulation, and reduced energy loss, helping create an overall much more efficient and smaller device.\n\n“By adopting a high-energy-density liquid dielectric Midel 7131 and a dual-width pulse-forming line, the study achieved miniaturisation of an integrated Tesla transformer and pulse-forming system,” scientists wrote in the study published in the journal High Power Laser and Particle Beams.\n\nMeasuring just four metres (13 feet) long and weighing only five tons, the new device is the world’s first compact driver for a high-power microwave (HPM) weapon.\n\nDesignated TPG1000Cs, it is small enough to be mounted on trucks, aircraft, and even other satellites, researchers say.\n\n“The system has demonstrated stable operation over continuous one-minute durations, accumulating approximately 200,000 pulses with consistent performance,” researchers wrote.\n\nExperts say a ground-based microwave weapon with an output over 1 gigawatt (GW) could severely disrupt Starlink satellites in orbit.\n\nTPG1000Cs can achieve extremely powerful electrical pulses reaching 20 GWs, researchers said, according to SCMP.\n\nChina has published a number of studies stating the need to find ways to disrupt Elon Musk’s Starlink satellites.\n\n\"The potential military application value of the Starlink megaconstellation has been highlighted in the Russia-Ukraine conflict,\" Chinese researchers from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics wrote in a study earlier this year.\n\n\"In recent years, the militarisation of space has intensified, posing a significant threat to China's space security. It is particularly important to track and monitor its operational status,\" they wrote in the research published in the journal Systems Engineering and Electronics.\n\nLast year, scientists from Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), which consistently contributes to China’s defence research, simulated a way to disrupt Starlink satellites spread over an area the size of Taiwan.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Feb 6 (Reuters) - China used this week's Singapore Airshow to flex its military and aviation muscle, drawing heavy attention from regional delegations as Beijing sharpens its bid for influence in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe U.S. military has demonstrated its power this year through the precision extraction of ​Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and a major naval buildup around Iran. Yet President Donald Trump has been vocal in his criticism of some of U.S. ‌allies and imposed tariffs on them, creating an opening for China.\n\nWhile China's fighter jets and commercial airliners remain far from achieving mass-market international adoption, their makers appeared more assertive and confident and enjoyed greater ‌visibility this year at Asia's largest air show.\n\nThe PLA Air Force's aerobatic team made a headline-grabbing show debut of its Chengdu J-10C fighter jets, an aircraft whose export variant, the J-10CE, surged to prominence in 2025 when customer Pakistan used it to shoot down an Indian Air Force French Rafale.\n\nChinese state media reported the team had used mid-air refuelling to fly directly to Singapore for the high-profile deployment.\n\n\"That's a bit of a message to say: Our power projection is growing,\" said Tim Robinson, editor-in-chief of the Royal ⁠Aeronautical Society's Aerospace magazine.\n\n\"It's one of the key enablers ‌a modern air force should have. Previously people said this is one of their weaknesses.\"\n\nInside the sweltering air show's air-conditioned halls, Chinese state companies occupied a prime spot with brightly lit displays dominated by a 1:2 scale model of AVIC's J-35A stealth multirole ‍fighter. Little is known about the latest addition to Chinese air power, which was first seen domestically in 2024.\n\nNo technical data was displayed, but observers of the global arms marketplace said the message to Asia's buyers was evident.\n\n\"That's obviously positioned to say: if you can't afford an F-35 or are banned from buying an F-35 we've got an alternative,\" Robinson said.\n\nSoutheast Asian defence officials crowded Chinese military and aerospace booths, underscoring Beijing’s growing pull as it aggressively markets hardware across the region.\n\nThe show of strength ‌landed at a politically sensitive moment, with Southeast Asian governments increasingly uneasy about U.S. security commitments amid a more isolationist Washington under Trump, analysts and Western officials said.\n\n\"We see the same delegations as before but the conversation has changed,\" said a senior official at a Western arms company.\n\nIndustry-watchers are cautious about any sudden switch of arms trade but agree the backdrop reflects the new power politics and the diversification of supply chains.\n\n\"The Chinese arms companies may think that, if other countries have lost confidence in buying American, there's an opportunity for China,\" said China defence specialist Bradley Perrett.\n\n\"But most of the U.S.' customers, if they want to look elsewhere, will look ⁠at European, South Korean and Japanese equipment.\"\n\nAsia's arms spending is growing apace as countries respond ​to a sustained build-up from an increasingly assertive China.\n\nChina's efforts to penetrate the airliner ​market, grabbing share from Airbus and Boeing, are proceeding slowly due in part to the lengthy process of winning European certification.\n\nBut state-owned planemaker COMAC again flew the C919 narrowbody jet and advertised the future C929 wide-body in model form at the show. That is now ‍progressing through detailed design as a Chinese ⁠project after initially exploring a joint development with Russia.\n\nChinese delegates said that given the Singapore venue, COMAC was prioritising potential clients from Southeast Asia, and Indonesian attendees were among those inquiring about aircraft.\n\nChina's efforts to rival Airbus and Boeing are a national priority though Western analysts say it will take ⁠years if not decades to establish the global footprint and marketing support that helps the industry leaders maintain entrenched positions.\n\nBut delegates noted a broadening commercial assault at the show including the market ‌for alternative third-party spare parts, tapping into airline concerns about shortages at a time when supplies are strained across the globe.",

    "title": "China's tech giants are opening their doors to OpenClaw. The Chinese internet is lapping it up.",
    "description": "OpenClaw is gaining ground in China as major tech firms add support and users flock to the viral AI agent.",
    "fullText": "The viral AI agent OpenClaw — formerly known as Clawdbot, then Moltbot — has found an audience in China.\n\nSince last week, Chinese tech companies including Tencent, Alibaba, and Volcano Engine, a cloud service platform under ByteDance, have begun integrating OpenClaw into their platforms, making it easier for Chinese users to run the agent. That includes connecting the agent to workplace tools such as Alibaba's collaboration platform, DingTalk, and Tencent Holdings' WeCom, the work version of China's super app, WeChat.\n\nOpenClaw began circulating widely in tech circles last month, attracting high-profile fans including Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan and multiple partners at Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nThe agent has also taken off among Chinese users, with demos, tutorials, and use cases spreading rapidly across local social platforms.\n\nOpenClaw is designed to run around the clock and plug into a wide range of consumer apps, allowing users to automate tasks such as managing schedules, overseeing vibe-coding sessions, or even building AI employees.\n\nIn a post on Tencent Cloud's developer platform, the company said last Thursday that its servers have rolled out a preconfigured OpenClaw application template, enabling users to deploy the AI assistant in the cloud with minimal setup.\n\nAlibaba Cloud has also rolled out support for OpenClaw on its platforms and said the agent can connect to a range of models from Alibaba's Qwen series.\n\nVolcano Engine, ByteDance's cloud services arm, outlined how developers can deploy Moltbot in its environment in an article published on Monday, while also flagging key safety considerations.\n\n\"Because the tool has extensive data, account, and network access permissions, please deploy it in a dedicated environment, avoid handling sensitive information, and be sure to review permissions regularly and set access restrictions for ECS and API keys,\" the article said, referring to cloud servers and access credentials.\n\nFor OpenClaw to run as a digital assistant across apps, it requires access to users' files, login details, browser activity, and other data.\n\nCybersecurity specialists told Business Insider in a report published on Wednesday that agents like OpenClaw can be vulnerable to \"prompt injections,\" a tactic that uses hidden instructions to trick AI into performing actions such as leaking data or publishing content on users' behalf.\n\nDespite mounting privacy and security concerns, enthusiasm for the agent among Chinese users shows little sign of slowing.\n\nPosts and demos featuring OpenClaw have surged on the Chinese social media platform RedNote.\n\nOne RedNote user who goes by \"Brother C\" posted a video tutorial last Tuesday, walking viewers through how to use OpenClaw. \"See how the 24/7 proactive AI assistant is revolutionizing workflows,\" he wrote. The post drew more than 4,000 likes and was saved over 6,000 times.\n\nAnother user posting under the nickname \"Teacher Du\" shared his own explainer on Monday, describing how OpenClaw could be deployed in everyday workflows. His post was saved more than 2,000 times and received over 1,000 likes.\n\n\"My experience was truly mind-blowing,\" he wrote, adding that the agent could handle \"all sorts of tasks\" and that the \"concept of a true AI employee is getting closer.\"\n\nLike their counterparts in the US, Chinese users are buying Mac Minis to run the agent. A RedNote user named Wu Bin said he had ordered a secondhand Mac Mini to serve as his \"super assistant.\"\n\n\"It's incredibly convenient, I can control it remotely to organize files and handle all sorts of tasks,\" he wrote.\n\nNot everyone is convinced. A user who goes by \"Programmer Yago\" warned in a RedNote post on Sunday that using the agent could leave users' data \"running naked all over the internet.\"\n\nOpenClaw did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Known as ‘white gold’, lithium is among the most important mined elements on the planet – ideal for the rechargeable batteries used in tech products. Can Europe’s largest deposit bring prosperity to the local community?\n\nIt looks more like the past than the future. A vast chasm scooped out of a scarred landscape, this is a Cornwall the summer holidaymakers don’t see: a former china clay pit near St Austell called Trelavour. I’m standing at the edge of the pit looking down with the man who says his plans for it will help the UK’s transition to renewable energy and bring back year-round jobs and prosperity to a part of the country that badly needs both. “And if I manage to make some money in the process, fantastic,” he says. “Though that is not what it’s about.”\n\nWe’ll return to him shortly. But first to the past, when this story begins, about 275-280m years ago. “There was a continental collision at the time,” Frances Wall, professor of applied mineralogy at the Camborne School of Mines at the University of Exeter, explained to me before my visit. This collision caused the bottom of the Earth’s crust to melt, with the molten material rising higher in the crust and forming granite. “There are lots of different types of granite that intrude at different times, more than 10m years or so,” she says. “The rock is made of minerals and, if you’ve got the right composition in the original material and the right conditions, then within those minerals there are some called mica. Some of those micas contain lithium.”\n\nThat’s what we are talking about here: lithium, the L-word. Or possibly the El Dorado word; lithium is often referred to as “white gold”, and in 2021 the then PM Boris Johnson declared that Cornwall would be the “Klondike of lithium”.\n\nIt is not breaking news that there is lithium here. Victorian miners reported finding it in the water coming from the ground. (You may know, possibly from Poldark, about Cornwall’s rich history mining tin and copper; it has been going on since the early bronze age, in about 2000BC.) Back then there was little use for lithium. Now it is a very different story. Its high electrochemical potential means lithium can hold a charge for longer than most other elements and so is ideal for use in rechargeable batteries. That’s phones, laptops and so much of the technology we use. Plus, electric cars and big battery storage projects. Lithium is now among the most important mined elements on the planet.\n\nMost of the world’s lithium is extracted in Australia and the lithium triangle in South America (Chile, Argentina and Bolivia), as well as in China, which also processes and therefore controls a majority of it for use in batteries. Cornwall doesn’t compare in scale, but it is, says Wall, “probably the largest lithium deposit in Europe”. A couple of companies – British Lithium and Cornish Lithium – are leading the way to tap into it.\n\nJeremy Wrathall is the founder of the latter. When he graduated from Camborne School of Mines in 1988, mining in Cornwall was gasping its last breaths – with just four active mines left, down from more than 300 in the 1860s. Now there are none, though there are still some china clay (kaolin) operations. So Wrathall went to work in South African goldmines, before returning to London to work as a mining analyst and financier.\n\nCornwall remained in his heart, though, and when electric cars began to be a thing, he remembered hearing about the lithium there. “I put lithium plus Cornwall into Google and up came four historical records of lithium being found in water. I thought: that one is an awful long way away from that one, they must be geologically connected. And then I thought: maybe I’m on to something and should start picking up mineral rights. So that’s what I did.”\n\nAlong with the mineral rights for which he did deals, Wrathall acquired a number of 19th-century mining plans, which gave him information about geological features – the granite and what was in it. He founded Cornish Lithium in 2016.\n\nWrathall says the UK – particularly Cornwall – will be able to extract 50,000 tonnes of lithium (actually lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate equivalent, depending on how it’s extracted) a year for more than 20 years – about 50% of the UK’s annual needs by 2030. There are two methods. One is to extract lithium from water via deep boreholes, which we will get to later. Here at Trelavour is the company’s “hard rock extraction” site. Wrathall picks up a small piece of rock. “You can see the sparkly bits, that’s the mica – all of this rock, everything you can see, has lithium.”\n\nHe explains that there will be some blasting, then the granite will be dug from the quarry and crushed before going on a conveyor belt to the processing plant in the valley. But, hang on; this doesn’t sound super sustainable, even if the intended destination is the UK’s transition to clean renewable energy. Lithium mining projects in Portugal and Serbia have been hampered by fierce opposition from locals and environmentalists. In Argentina, mining companies and politicians have been accused of robbing Indigenous people of their water and employing colonial-style divide-and-rule tactics in pursuit of the valuable metal. Why is that not happening here?\n\nWall explains that it is a very different process in South America, where brine gets pumped into a series of ponds and then evaporates slowly in the sun. Cornwall has neither the geology nor climate for that. Trelavour is a traditional quarry, “so you’ve got all your normal stuff associated with quarrying: drilling, blasting and lorries.” Environmental permits are very strict, she says, and they’ll need to sort out what they’re doing with the waste. “But the granite is pretty benign, it’s not like some of the sulphides, where you have a lot of trouble with acid mine drainage [the outflow of acidic water largely from metal and coal mines].”\n\nSome of the byproducts could be valuable: silica for cement, sulphate of potash for fertiliser, gypsum for plasterboard. Wrathall says the company’s crushers are electric and it will look into using electric trucks. “We’re trying our best to go zero carbon, or very low carbon.” The situation in Cornwall is different from the controversial projects in Europe, he says, because the quarry already exists; they will simply be repurposing it. “You can see the damage is done. In Portugal, it is a pristine area, olive groves, it would be digging up people’s farms. This is not a farm. What are you going to do with this? It’s dangerous, fenced-off to stop people getting in. And at the end of it, we will rehabilitate it.”\n\nI have found it hard to find anyone who is really against the project. Charmian Larke of the Cornwall Climate Action Network says: “Because the area is so destroyed anyway, the surrounding villages tend to be very poor, with poor health and educational outcomes.” Wrathall says the Cornish people are proud of their 4,000-year history of mining, “and it will bring back economic prosperity to an area with one of the highest levels of deprivation in the country”.\n\nOn cue, we are joined by Peter Morse, general manager of the hard-rock project here. He grew up in the nearby village of Roche. His family has been here for generations, he says, mostly working in the china clay industry, and he used to ride around in a truck with his grandad, driving in and out of the plants. He thought he would go into it, too, and did a geology degree. Instead, he went to the US, where he worked in the mining industry for 30 years.\n\nWrathall and Morse are what are known as “Cousin Jacks” – Cornish miners who went abroad to work. “If you go anywhere in the world and there’s a hole, there’ll be a Cousin Jack at the bottom of it,” says Morse. They took a bit of Cornwall with them: he says he could get a pasty on the shores of Lake Superior.\n\nWhen he came back home, it was different from when he left: fewer people were employed in the china clay business. St Dennis, the village nearest to the site, used to have three pubs and a bunch of shops. Now there is just one of each. “And St Austell is not the town it was when I went to school there. It was bustling, lively – but it doesn’t feel like that now.”\n\nMorse says lithium can help to reverse the trend. Cousin Jack is back. I also spoke to Noah Law, another local, now Labour MP for St Austell and Newquay. “Mining is part of our heritage, it’s part of what makes Cornwall great. It has made us wealthy in the past and can do the same again.”\n\nThings have changed though. “Mining is more capital intensive than it used to be, and not as labour intensive. Part of the challenge is sharing the prosperity. I’ve levelled with the industry to say we’re really invested in this and are going to work hard to make a success of the industry, if it is willing to work really hard to make sure my constituents are sharing the spoils.”\n\nLaw says Cornwall can be a beautiful place and an industrial powerhouse, “because that’s what we have been for the most of the past 200-300 years. It’s only recently that Cornwall hasn’t been an industrial economy.”\n\nCornish Lithium employs just over 100 people, and the plan is to triple that. “Every mining job provides at least four times as many knock-on jobs,” says Wrathall. And not just another shop selling wetsuits or ice cream. “They’re good, but that’s not going to make any difference to the lives of people here. What is going to make a difference is the development of an industry that is already here, but is now seeing its next generation. It’s going to change Cornwall’s future.”\n\nWe have come down from the quarry to the processing plant, where the lithium gets extracted from the granite. At this stage it’s a demonstration facility, but it still takes up a huge shed, a remnant of a former china clay facility. The crushed granite comes in at one end and the lithium is extracted in a series of processes. First physical – milling, soaking, spinning – followed by chemical separation that involves dissolving the mica in sulphuric acid. All the machinery – mills and pipes, scrubbers and chillers, pumps and vats – looks rather Willy Wonka. And here’s a bag of the end product – lithium hydroxide, a white crystalline power that looks, frankly, illegal.\n\nAbout 20 miles away, the villages of St Day and Gwennap were once big centres for tin and copper mining and the surrounding landscape is dotted with derelict brick engine houses from that time. Between the two is now the centre for Cornish Lithium’s other project: geothermal extraction. It doesn’t look much, a capped borehole in the corner of the United Downs industrial estate, but under the cap a shaft goes down 800 metres. This was the first exploratory hole. They’ve since done others, including one 2km deep on a farm a few miles away at Cross Lanes. The results were very positive and Cross Lanes has recently been granted planning permission for the country’s first commercial geothermal lithium production facility.\n\nIn another shed, Adam Matthews, who leads the geology team, shows me what it’s all about. Laid out on trays are hundreds of core samples of rock from the Cross Lanes drill holes: they look like pencil leads for giants. One is solid, “siltstone and sandstones mostly, the darker bands are muds, nothing of much interest”, says Matthews. But here’s one from 1,700 metres down, “and you can see fractures running throughout the rock. The water flows naturally throughout those fractures.”\n\nIn this water – hot brine – they have found lithium. The next stage is to drill two new larger diameter 2km-deep holes, one to pump the water out, the other to return it once the lithium has been extracted. It’s probably the least impactful, most sustainable way of getting hold of lithium.\n\nThe water at that depth is between 80 and 90C and Wrathall says it could be used to provide low-carbon heat energy for communities and industries. There are few houses to heat near to Cross Lanes, but he says the heat could be used in agriculture. “There is an opportunity to build greenhouses there, to grow tomatoes and cucumbers.”\n\nIt sounds wonderful – pumping water out of the ground, extracting the mineral that will help the country on its transition to renewable energy, then returning the water to where it came from … with a byproduct of locally grown salad.\n\nBut we’re not quite there yet. The next phase will be to build a demonstration plant to produce samples of lithium. If successful, the company will build a commercial production plant there. The Trelavour hard rock site is also still at the demonstration phase. Wrathall thinks they will first be producing lithium commercially in 2028 or 29. Even then the UK will still have to import about half of what it needs. Reliance on China isn’t over yet.\n\nSince they’ve been looking at lithium in Cornwall, “we’ve seen critical minerals go from ‘Who cares?’ to ‘Oh my goodness, what are we going to do?’” says Wrathall. “Why is Trump interested in Greenland? Minerals. Ukraine? Minerals. Canada? Minerals? I’m just hoping he doesn’t find out about Cornwall!”",

    "fullText": "China has unveiled plans for a space carrier that can deploy unmanned fighter jets capable of firing missiles from the edge of the Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nState media released a concept video of the futuristic Luanniao, the world’s biggest warship, travelling through space above all current defensive systems.\n\nChina claimed the carrier could become operational in 20 to 30 years’ time. However, experts were sceptical about the project and some likened it to a stunt designed to “inspire the Chinese public”.\n\nResembling a spaceship from a Star Wars film, the Luanniao will be a huge grey triangular aircraft carrier 242 metres long and 684 metres wide. It will have a take-off weight of 120,000 tons – significantly more than any similar craft in operation today.\n\nAccording to state media, the Luanniao will be designed to carry up to 88 unmanned Xuan Nu fighter jets. These will reportedly be highly manoeuvrable stealth aircraft capable of launching hypersonic missiles, but will be significantly heavier than drones.\n\nIf completed, the new spaceship would “outclass pretty much everyone”, according to Peter Layton, a defence expert and a visiting fellow at Australia’s Griffith Asia Institute.\n\nIt would be capable of flying over surface-to-air missiles and other fighter aircraft, he said, adding: “You’re also out of range of the weather, generally speaking – and you’re out of range of most defensive systems.”\n\nThe Luanniao could also allow Beijing to position it directly above targets and launch missiles at them.\n\nSuch capabilities would give China a significant advantage, including over Taiwan and in the South China Sea, which could be the scene of a future war against the United States.\n\nThe Luanniao is part of China’s broader Nantianmen Project, which translates to South Heavenly Gate.\n\nDeveloped by the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, the project encompasses a number of ambitious plans to expand the country’s air and space capabilities.\n\nOne of the most prominent elements is a sixth-generation fighter, known as the Baidi fighter, that will also be able to operate near space. A model of the jet was displayed at China’s International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition in 2024.\n\nThe Luanniao is the latest development in the ongoing space race between the US and China. Beijing has been investing in developing rockets and satellites in an effort to push the US out of the lead and, by some metrics, it is now winning.\n\nIn 2024, China successfully launched the Chang’e-6, a robotic spacecraft, which reached the Moon’s far side and returned to Earth with lunar samples.\n\nThe Chang’e-7 mission, which has the goal of finding water on the Moon’s surface, is planned for August.\n\nWhile the US still has leading capabilities, its momentum seems to be slowing while China’s is increasing.\n\nThe Luanniao, by far the most ambitious part of the Nantianmen Project, was first conceived more than 10 years ago, but was dismissed by most experts as a fantasy project. For many, it still is.\n\nThe technology needed for an aircraft to hover at the edge of the Earth’s atmospheric boundary and launch missiles towards the surface does not currently exist. It would require “enormous amounts of fuel” as well as a new kind of propulsion system that had yet to be developed, said Mr Layton.\n\nOne way in which China could achieve a similar result is by putting the carrier into orbit, similar to a satellite or rocket. However, in orbit the aircraft would be vulnerable to debris, which would destroy it in the event of a collision.\n\nTo launch the Luanniao into orbit, China would also need a reusable rocket. It has been working towards one for years, but has been unable to achieve it so far.\n\nBeijing could look to Elon Musk’s SpaceX reusable rockets for inspiration. However, the country is probably 10 to 15 years away from developing its own, said Mr Layton.\n\nGiven the major obstacles around the development of the Luanniao, the timing of Beijing’s announcement is likely to be part of a wider strategy – both at home and abroad.\n\nMr Layton explained that China used stunts like this to “inspire the Chinese public” and show itself to be at the cutting edge of technological innovation.\n\nPushing the narrative around futuristic spacecraft was part of a greater effort to demonstrate to its neighbours that it was a leading military power, he said.\n\n“For the external audience, it does paint the picture that they are working on technology that the region just can’t aspire to – it’s literally Star Wars stuff,” he added.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "This year China will see its solar capacity outstrip its coal capacity for the first time, according to an industry group.\n\nIn its latest projections, the China Electricity Council says that, by the end of 2026, wind and solar will account for nearly half of China’s power capacity. Including hydro and nuclear power, clean energy will amount to nearly two-thirds of total power capacity, while coal will amount to a third.\n\nImportantly, capacity refers to the maximum amount of electricity a power plant can produce. Coal plants run closer to their maximum than wind or solar plants. So while coal capacity now trails renewable capacity, coal still accounts for about half of all power produced in China.\n\nStill, that is starting to change. For years, China built renewable power and fossil power in tandem. But now, solar and wind aren’t just supplementing coal, they are displacing it.\n\nEven as China continues to build new coal plants, the average plant is also burning less coal. Competing with cheap solar and wind, a large share of coal plants are now operating at a loss. And under the latest government guidelines, coal will begin serving a more limited role. Increasingly, coal generators will act as “peaker” plants, meeting sudden spikes in power demand or gaps in the supply of wind and solar.\n\nPerversely, the coming decline of coal has spurred a rush to build new plants. Facing the prospect that Chinese leaders will further limit the use of coal, developers submitted a record number of proposals to build or reactivate coal power plants last year, according to a new analysis.\n\nLauri Myllyvirta, an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, believes that China is now at a crossroads.\n\n“You have to either put brakes on coal power plant construction and start closing down older coal power plants, or you have to slow down the clean energy expansion,” he said in an interview with Yale Environment 360. “That’s the choice that China’s policymakers are likely going to have to make within the next year or two.”",

    "fullText": "China has banned hidden door handles on electric vehicles (EVs), making it the first country to stop the use of the controversial designs that were made popular by multi-billionaire Elon Musk's Tesla.\n\nIt comes as EVs are facing scrutiny from safety watchdogs around the world after a number of deadly incidents, including two fatal crashes in China involving Xiaomi EVs in which power failures were suspected to have prevented doors from being opened.\n\nUnder the new regulations, cars will only be allowed to be sold if they have a mechanical release both on the inside and outside of their doors, according to state media.\n\nThe new rules are due to take effect on 1 January 2027.\n\nThe Ministry of Industry and Information Technology rules require the outside of every passenger door except the boot, to have a recessed space measuring no smaller than 6cm (2 in) by 2cm by 2.5cm to allow access to the handle.\n\nInside the car there must be signs measuring at least 1cm by 0.7cm to show how to open the door.\n\nCars that have already been approved by authorities and are in the final stages of entering the Chinese market will have another two years to update their designs.\n\nHidden handles are widely used in China's new energy vehicle (NEV) market, which includes EVs as well as hybrid cars and those powered by fuel cells.\n\nThey feature in about 60% of the top 100 best-selling NEVs, according to data cited by government-controlled newspaper China Daily.\n\nAlthough the measures will only apply to models sold in the Chinese market, the country's huge presence in the global car industry means the move is likely to have an impact around the world.\n\nTesla's door handles are already being investigated by US safety regulators and authorities in Europe are considering their own rules.\n\nIn November, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a probe focused on Tesla's electric-powered door handles, responding to reports that they suddenly stopped working, leaving children trapped in the cars.\n\nThe NHTSA said it had received nine complaints about the handles in Tesla's 2021 Model Y cars, the company's flagship model.\n\nIn four of the cases, the car owners resorted to breaking the window to resolve the issue.",

    "description": "Automation and robots are becoming mainstays in many industries, but researchers and farmers in China are taking innovation in smart farming to the next level.",
    "fullText": "Much has been made of the AI race between the U.S. and China as the two national powers jockey for leadership in the world's fastest-growing industry. To some Western observers, China's progress in autonomous robotics is a cause for concern. But the nation's robotics revolution extends far beyond surveillance and military uses, existing at the junction of increasingly capable computing, manufacturing, and industrialization capacities. This confluence is perhaps best exemplified by China's advancements in smart agriculture, where engineers are bringing autonomous robots to the country's crop farming, livestock, and aquaculture industries. By developing autonomous robots to help plant and harvest crops, control pests, identify diseases, monitor livestock health, and even socially engineer fish behavior, China has achieved several major milestones in its robotic farming program.\n\nBeijing highlighted its ambitions to boost AI farming in the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs' National Smart Agriculture Action Plan. In the plan, the government outlines its expectation for more than 30% of its agricultural production to be led by information-driven systems by 2026. Spearheading this nationwide smart-farming initiative is the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which has developed a national strategy for fostering groundbreaking advancements in robot-assisted farming throughout several Chinese provinces. To accelerate these developments, Beijing has established 34 innovation labs and 35 IT laboratories dedicated to smart agriculture. As a result, farms across the country have begun employing LLMs and autonomous robots in their operations. This trend could pioneer a new global agricultural landscape in which AI drives progress in multiple endeavors, from fighting potato blights to genetically modifying crops.\n\nRobotics is playing an increasingly important role in China's crop management systems. For instance, in China's Sichuan province, autonomous robots inspect rice fields using blacklight cameras, funneling data through their built-in AI systems to flag both pests and diseases. At another farm, \"smart brain\" systems remotely monitor fields to gather data on soil quality, crop health, and environmental trends, enabling forecasts on crop growth, yields, and pest outbreaks. One WeChat-controlled set of farming robots can plant seeds, harvest crops, and remove weeds.\n\nSome projects have even applied AI-driven robotics to crop breeding, with one team of scientists having sped up crop development by 400% using the technology, per SCMP. This process was facilitated by \"robot-friendly\" crops that are designed to be easier for robots to pollinate and harvest. By employing these same autonomous robotic systems, some Chinese farms have been able to fully automate their crop cultivation processes.\n\nBeijing's use cases for robotics in farming go beyond crops, however. One robot developed by Muyuan Foods Co., Ltd. utilizes smart sensors to monitor and analyze animal biometrics. Fisheries have also begun developing high-tech autonomous solutions that monitor fish behavior and growth patterns. For example, at Beijing's National Innovation Center for Digital Fishery, robotic fish modeled after tuna and dolphins swim through breeding tanks to monitor fish patterns, environment health, and net infrastructure; they achieve this without disturbing their aquatic counterparts. Developers hope these robotic fish might eventually lead schools of fish to designated harvesting and feeding areas, on top of potentially being used for deep-sea exploration.\n\nChina's robotics revolution coincides with broader leaps in data analysis and agricultural machinery. Using data from autonomous robots, drones, and other intelligent farming systems, Chinese engineers may be able to take the guesswork out of irrigation, pest control, and planting schedules. Farmers have begun using smart farming to analyze factors impacting crop growth — including temperature, rainfall, soil moisture, and mineral levels — to better define irrigation needs, plan drought responses, and predict ripeness. In one farm, autonomous drones collect crop maturity data to produce horticultural maps that can guide harvesting.\n\nCompounded with its advancements in robotics, China is also seeing substantial growth in its domestic machinery production. The nation exported $9.3 billion in agricultural machinery in the first half of 2025 — a 26.5% jump from the previous year, according to Global Times. Domestically produced intelligent harvesting technology, including AI-assisted corn harvesters, points to a major shift in an agricultural industry that has historically depended on imported high-end machinery. According to a Xinhua English-language report on seed technology, the northwestern Xinjiang region of China has seen particular success from these advancements, achieving a 97% mechanization rate in its cotton farming practices.\n\nSome experts do question the scalability of intelligent automated farming systems, particularly in a country with a diverse climate, geography, and crop output. These variables introduce significant challenges in building standardized, cost-effective autonomous farming systems — and given the industry's historically small profit margins, cost is a particularly pressing consideration. But combined with other technological leaps, such as \"smart soil\" that grows bigger crops with less water and insect drones that can pollinate crops, the global agriculture industry just might be on the precipice of its next technological revolution.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",
