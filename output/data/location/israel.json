    "description": "The US and its allies are renewing their push to hold a conference on Gaza reconstruction, people familiar with the matter said, as the Trump administration looks to inject fresh momentum into a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas after a string of setbacks.\nWashington has been discussed as a potential venue for the conference that could happen as early as next month, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private conversations. Egypt is among several other locations also being considered, one of the people said.\nThat person said the event would probably take place only after officials fill out the Board of Peace that will oversee a transitional government and whose creation was spelled out in the ceasefire that ended the fighting between Israel and Hamas and was signed in October.
