    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nThe first Iron Beam laser defense system was deployed by Israel on Sunday. This 100kW laser weapon thus became the world’s first high-power drone defense zapper to be operationally deployed. Iron Beam lasers will fortify Israel’s multi-layered defense, complementing the existing Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and Arrow system architecture.\n\nThe Iron Beam is a short-range line-of-sight laser interceptor that is extremely cheap to run and, therefore, perfectly suited for intercepting low-cost, high-volume threats. According to the official Israeli announcement, Iron Beam systems have “successfully intercepted rockets, mortars, and UAVs.”\n\nA complex mix of government, military, scientific, and commercial interests were responsible for the research and development of the Iron Beam laser system. Central to the Iron Beam are “an advanced laser source and a unique electro-optical targeting system, enabling the interception of a wide range of targets at an enhanced operational range, with maximum precision and superior efficiency,” boasted the press release by Israel’s MoD. Moreover, it works “at a negligible marginal cost, which constitutes the laser system’s primary advantage.”\n\nWe don’t get much more by way of technical details, perhaps understandably. However, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems execs heralded the system’s “unique adaptive optics technology,” in what it calls “the world’s most advanced laser-based system for intercepting aerial threats.” Its operational debut “marks the beginning of the era of high-energy laser defense,” they claimed.\n\nWe have seen low-energy laser defense systems deployed earlier this year, with Japan’s NTT using relatively puny lasers to scare birds away from poultry farms and prevent the spread of avian flu. But the Iron Beam is in a different league.\n\nWe also previously reported on several other UK laser weapons under development to counter UAVs on land and at sea. But as far as we know, these are yet to become operational. With the brutal war between Ukraine and Russia ongoing, where drones have grown to be a pivotal feature of the conflict, forces have gone as far as creating rotating barbed wire barriers to deter them. So, laser-drone defenses similar to the Iron Beam are going to be in strong demand.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.",

    "description": "Israel on Tuesday said it had suspended more than two dozen humanitarian organizations, including Doctors Without Borders and CARE, from operating in the Gaza Strip for failing to comply with new registration rules.  Israel says the rules are aimed at preventing Hamas and other militant groups from infiltrating the aid organizations.",
    "fullText": "JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel on Tuesday said it had suspended more than two dozen humanitarian organizations, including Doctors Without Borders and CARE, from operating in the Gaza Strip for failing to comply with new registration rules.\n\nIsrael says the rules are aimed at preventing Hamas and other militant groups from infiltrating the aid organizations. But the organizations say the rules are arbitrary and warned that the new ban would harm a civilian population desperately in need of humanitarian aid.\n\nIsrael has claimed throughout the war that Hamas was siphoning off aid supplies, a charge the U.N. and aid groups have denied. The new rules, announced by Israel early this year, require aid organizations to register the names of their workers and provide details about funding and operations in order to continue working in Gaza.\n\nThe new regulations included ideological requirements — including disqualifying organizations that have called for boycotts against Israel, denied the Oct. 7 attack or expressed support for any of the international court cases against Israeli soldiers or leaders.\n\nIsrael’s Ministry of Diaspora Affairs said more than 30 groups — about 15% of the organizations operating in Gaza — had failed to comply and that their operations would be suspended. It also said that Doctors Without Borders, one of the biggest and best-known groups in Gaza, had failed to respond to Israeli claims that some of its workers were affiliated with Hamas or Islamic Jihad.\n\n“The message is clear: humanitarian assistance is welcome — the exploitation of humanitarian frameworks for terrorism is not,” Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli said.\n\nDoctors Without Borders, also known by its French acronym MSF, said Israel's decision would have a catastrophic impact on their work in Gaza, where they support around 20% of the hospital beds and a third of births. The organization also denied Israel's accusations about their staff.\n\n“MSF would never knowingly employ people engaging in military activity,” it said.\n\nWhile Israel claimed the decision would have limited impact on the ground. the affected organizations said the timing — less than three months into a fragile ceasefire — was devastating.\n\n“Despite the ceasefire, the needs in Gaza are enormous and yet we and dozens of other organizations are and will continue to be blocked from bringing in essential life-saving assistance,” said Shaina Low, communications adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council, which has also been suspended.\n\n“Not being able to send staff into Gaza means all of the workload falls on our exhausted local staff,” Low said.\n\nSome aid groups say they didn’t submit the list of Palestinian staff, as Israel demanded, for fear they’d be targeted by Israel, and because of data protection laws in Europe.\n\n“It comes from a legal and safety perspective. In Gaza, we saw hundreds of aid workers get killed,” Low explained.\n\nThe decision not to renew aid groups’ licenses means offices in Israel and East Jerusalem will close, and organizations won’t be able to send international staff or aid into Gaza.\n\nIsrael says militants exploiting aid groups\n\nAccording to the ministry, the decision means the aid groups will have their license revoked on Jan. 1, and if they are located in Israel, they will need to leave by March 1. They can appeal the decision.\n\nThe Israeli defense body that oversees humanitarian aid to Gaza, COGAT, said that the organizations on the list contribute less than 1% of the total aid going into the Gaza Strip, and that aid will continue to enter from more than 20 organizations that did receive permits to continue operating.\n\n“The registration process is intended to prevent the exploitation of aid by Hamas, which in the past operated under the cover of certain international aid organizations, knowingly or unknowingly,” COGAT said in a statement.\n\nThis isn't the first time Israel has tried to crack down on international humanitarian organizations. Throughout the war, Israel accused the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, of being infiltrated by Hamas, using its facilities and taking aid. The United Nations has denied it. UNRWA, the top U.N. agency working with Palestinians, has denied knowingly aiding armed groups and says it acts quickly to purge any suspected militants..\n\nAfter months of criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right allies, Israel banned UNRWA from operating on its territory in January. The U.S., formerly the largest donor to UNRWA, halted funding to the agency in early 2024.\n\nNGOs say Israel vague over data use\n\nIsrael failed to confirm that the data collected from the new regulations wouldn't be used for military or intelligence purposes, raising serious security concerns, said Athena Rayburn, the executive director of AIDA, an umbrella organization representing over 100 organizations that operate in the Palestinian territories. She noted that more than 500 aid workers have been killed in Gaza during the war.\n\n“Agreeing for a party to the conflict to vet our staff, especially under the conditions of occupation, is a violation of humanitarian principles, specifically neutrality and independence,” she said.\n\nRayburn said organizations expressed their concerns and offered alternatives to submitting staff lists, such as third-party vetting, but that Israel refused to engage in any dialogue.\n\nPalestinian girl killed in Gaza\n\nA 10-year-old girl was killed and another person was wounded by Israeli fire in Gaza City near the Yellow Line that delineates areas under Israeli control, the territory's Shifa Hospital said Tuesday.\n\nThe Israeli military did not immediately comment on the incident but have said troops operating near the Yellow Line will target anyone who approaches or threatens soldiers.\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry, part of the Hamas-run government, said on Monday that 71,266 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, not including the girl. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count. The United Nations and independent experts consider the Health Ministry the most reliable source on war casualties. Israel disputes its figures but has not provided its own.\n\nFind more of AP’s Israel-Hamas coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.",

    "fullText": "JERUSALEM, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Nvidia (NVDA) is in advanced talks to buy Israel-based AI startup AI21 Labs for as much as $3 ​billion, the Calcalist financial daily reported on Tuesday.\n\nNvidia declined to ‌comment, while AI21 was not immediately available to comment.\n\nA 2023 funding round valued AI21 at $1.4 ‌billion. Nvidia and Alphabet's Google participated in that funding.\n\nAI21, founded in 2017 by Amnon Shashua and two others, is among a clutch of AI startups that have benefited from a boom in artificial intelligence, attracting strong ⁠interest from venture capital ‌firms and other investors.\n\nShashua is also the founder and CEO of Mobileye, a developer of self-driving car technologies.\n\nCalcalist ‍said AI21 has long been up for sale and talks with Nvidia have advanced significantly in recent weeks.

    "fullText": "Our reporting revealed a symbiotic relationship between the IDF and Silicon Valley – with implications for the future of warfare\n\nIn January this year, Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham first reported that Microsoft had deepened its ties to Israel alongside other major tech firms. Since then, the Guardian has published an award-winning series of investigations – in partnership with the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and the Hebrew-language outlet Local Call – that has revealed a symbiotic relationship between Silicon Valley and the Israeli military.\n\nOne investigation exposed an Israeli mass surveillance program scooping up virtually all Palestinian phone calls and storing them on Microsoft’s cloud services – setting off an inquiry that ultimately prompted the company to cut off Israel’s access to some of its technology. Another story revealed that the Israeli military created a ChatGPT-like tool to analyze data collected through the surveillance of Palestinians. Yet another revealed that Google and Amazon had agreed to extraordinary terms to clinch a lucrative contract with Israel.\n\nI asked Davies and Abraham to discuss what they learned this year – about the role of these technologies in Israel’s assault on Gaza, whether these business ties are sustainable, and what the revelations tell us about how the wars of the future will be fought.\n\nHow did Israel’s relationships with these companies change after October 7?\n\nYuval Abraham: The Israeli military had been fetishizing artificial intelligence and big data for many years – a trend that is very much connected to Israel’s occupation of the Palestinians, because the occupation generates a lot of data. What changed after October 7 was the scope. The military was looking to bomb hundreds of targets every day in Gaza. Tens of thousands of people were recruited into reserve duty. That meant a huge spike in usage of technological systems. That’s where the big tech companies stepped in.\n\nHarry Davies: There was a huge surge in demand – not just for the storage capacities of the tech companies, but also for the products that they offer to analyze the information used to prosecute a war. What’s valuable for the military is the way in which these services are able to provide what’s known as “blob storage”, which allows them to store and process infinite amounts of raw intelligence information.\n\nWhat has made Israel such an appealing market for these companies?\n\nYuval Abraham: As we reported, the Israeli army has been collecting Palestinian phone calls for a long time. But when you want to collect the phone calls of an entire population every day, and you want to retain those phone calls for long periods of time, you need a lot of storage room and processing power.\n\nIf you remember the [Edward] Snowden revelations, many of them had to do with metadata, which doesn’t weigh a lot. But the Israeli military also wanted to store mass audio files, images or videos – and for that it felt it needed the assistance of companies like Microsoft. In the West Bank, sources have told us this information has been used to find dirt on people to blackmail them. In the Gaza Strip, we know that this massive trove of intercepted phone calls was also used in airstrikes that killed civilians.\n\nSo data is power and data is control. And these American cloud providers allow the Israeli military to store a lot of data and to sift through it very effectively. That has direct consequences for people on the ground.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories. Messages are end to end encrypted and concealed within the routine activity that every Guardian mobile app performs. This prevents an observer from knowing that you are communicating with us at all, let alone what is being said.\n\nIf you don’t already have the Guardian app, download it (iOS/Android) and go to the menu. Select ‘Secure Messaging’.\n\nTo send a message to Harry and Yuval please choose the ‘UK Investigations’ team.\n\nYou can message Harry using the Signal Messenger app. Use the ‘find by username’ option and type hfd.90\n\nIf you don’t need a high level of security or confidentiality you can email harry.davies@theguardian.com\n\nSecureDrop and other secure methods\n\nIf you can safely use the tor network without being observed or monitored you can send messages and documents to the Guardian via our SecureDrop platform.\n\nFinally, our guide at theguardian.com/tips lists several ways to contact us securely, and discusses the pros and cons of each.\n\nHarry Davies: Yossi Sariel, the former head of [Israel’s elite spy agency] Unit 8200, wrote a book under a pseudonym that we revealed to have been published by him. In that book, he articulated what at the time was a bold and radical vision – as Yuval described, this fetishization of Silicon Valley technology. He recognized the possibilities that the likes of Google, Amazon and Microsoft could afford the Israeli military. Two years before October 7, he said that militaries and governments needed to forge relationships with these companies that are similar to the relationships they have with companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin. So he was already thinking about these companies as instrumental to war and surveillance in the way that a defense contractor provides components for fighter jets or manufactures bombs and missiles.\n\nSome of our reporting has looked at how elements of his vision have come true and have been put into effect, both before October 7 and afterwards, in both the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nWe know AI is central to Israel’s military operations – its army has developed its own AI capabilities, as you revealed, Yuval, and has also purchased AI tools for use from Microsoft. Why is AI so central to Israel’s broader war aims?\n\nYuval Abraham: What AI did was allow Israel to achieve the effective results of carpet bombing without losing the legitimacy of a data-driven assault with targets and objectives. In Gaza, one way in which the Israeli military used AI was to give a score to almost every person in Gaza who has a phone number, determining how likely it was that person was a member of Hamas or Islamic Jihad. This score was based on a machine-learning algorithm [developed by Israel] called Lavender. It was trained on a dataset of known Hamas members. AI allowed the Israeli military to generate and bomb tens of thousands of military targets, on a scale that without AI would not have been humanly possible. Many of the targets were not Hamas members, according to sources. And Israel for the most part bombed these people not while they were engaged in military activity, but when they stepped inside their families’ homes.\n\nThese AI systems had an error rate that the Israeli military knew about. But to me, the key thing about AI is not the mistakes that it makes. It’s the scale of destruction that it allows militaries to unleash, and it’s a discourse of legitimacy that it enables – a discourse of targets and collateral damage.\n\nAI also seems to me to incentivize mass surveillance, right? Because it allows for the analysis of ever-growing reams of information.\n\nHarry Davies: Signals intelligence agencies have long collected more information than they could humanly process. That served as a kind of restraint on their ability to conduct mass surveillance. I think we’re now seeing a shift where AI allows an intelligence agency like Unit 8200 to make sense of things that previously it struggled to make sense of.\n\nMicrosoft explicitly credited your reporting for changing its policies. Are you seeing any other signs of shifts within the tech industry?\n\nHarry Davies: I think we’re seeing a lot of discomfort and dissent within these companies at both a junior and to some extent senior level. Many employees have been disturbed to find what the products and services that they’re working around the clock to build and market are actually contributing to. There have been protest groups which have emerged from current and former employees within these companies. That’s true across Silicon Valley. I think that played some role in the decision that Microsoft made as a result of our reporting. They were facing a lot of pressure internally.\n\nYuval Abraham: And there’s also a legal question for these companies: if the ICJ [international court of justice] ends up ruling that Israel has committed a genocide, then a follow-up question will be: who contributed to that genocide? Which companies helped maintain it and sustain it? For some people in these companies who are thinking ahead, that could also be a cause for concern.\n\nIt sounds like you think shifts in public support for Israel could actually affect these business relationships.\n\nYuval Abraham: Israel has developed a reliance on these companies for its Nimbus project, which is a huge contract signed between Israel and Google and Amazon back in 2021. It is moving the data of many of its government ministries, along with troves of information from the Ministry of Defense, onto these companies’ cloud servers.\n\nThese are US companies. They’re taking a certain gamble here that the US will stay loyal to Israel and won’t block, limit or sanction them.\n\nMicrosoft only blocked access to technology that was specifically enabling the mass surveillance of Palestinian phone calls – there are still many relationships between Microsoft and the Israeli military. But Microsoft’s action made many people in the Israeli system nervous. It was the first time we know of that a big tech company withdrew services from the Israeli military. It made some people ask whether Israel is making a mistake by giving these foreign companies so much leverage. That question is folded within a larger question of what the US will do, what will happen in 2028 if there’s a more progressive administration in the White House, at a time when so many Americans believe that Israel has committed a genocide in Gaza.\n\nWhat’s your focus going to be in 2026?\n\nYuval Abraham: I think we only uncovered the tip of the iceberg.\n\nHarry Davies: We’re both very conscious that, although we have spent a lot of time working on this, we still just have glimpses inside the system. We’re continuing to build a fuller picture of how this technology was and continues to be used in Gaza and in the West Bank as well.\n\nThere’s good reason to continue paying attention. Militaries pay attention to what other militaries are doing. There is great interest among other western militaries in how Israel prosecuted this war, in how it integrated these kind of technologies.\n\nAnd there are other militaries whose combat systems and processes are already deeply integrated with Silicon Valley tech. Take the American military, for example. Look at what’s happening right now in the Caribbean. Are those operations somehow free of the involvement or reliance on systems and services provided by these companies? I suspect not. We don’t know for sure, but the Pentagon and the US military have very big contracts with all of these companies to provide cloud services. Post-Gaza, we have to look at these relationships and ask: what is the involvement of these companies and their technology in military decisions, in military operations and in warfare more broadly?\n\nYuval Abraham: Much of our reporting is based on whistleblowers, on individuals who are in proximity to power or hold positions of power.\n\nHarry Davies: Our confidential sources have remained confidential and we are always interested in hearing from new people. Our door is always open.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Some of the world's largest tech companies have a presence in Israel, including Apple, Meta, Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, and Google.\n\n\"The relocation risk poses a direct threat to Israel's innovation engines,\" the NGO said, adding: \"A significant wave of employee departures could undermine local innovation capabilities and weaken Israel's technological leadership.\"\n\nThe report found recruitment increases among multinationals in Israel had nevertheless exceeded decreases during the war, which it said highlighted the \"organizational resilience and continued investment in talent\" from these companies.\n\nThe data came from a mix of industry reports and public sources, as well as surveys and interviews with tech executives in multinational entities, the IATI said.\n\nIsrael's tech sector is a key driver of its economy. The Israel Innovation Authority, a government body, said the tech industry contributed one-fifth of the country's GDP in 2023. It labeled the high-tech sector \"the shock absorber of the Israeli economy.\"\n\nThe IATI report said that there are around 430 multinational companies in Israel, with around 90,000 high-tech employees working for them.\n\nIt added that while multinationals had shown resilience over the course of the war — which broke out following the October 7 attacks on Israel — many had also faced business headwinds.\n\nAround 22% of companies recorded reduced business activity during the conflict, it said, with 8% reporting a significant decline. However, 57% reported no change in business activity over the period and 21% expanded operations, per the report, which the IATI said showed \"continued confidence in and robustness of local MNC activity.\"\n\nDror Bin, the CEO of the Israel Innovation Authority, previously said that the Israeli economy's dependence on the high-tech sector had \"significantly grown in the past decade.\"\n\n\"We must do everything necessary to preserve the industry and continue nurturing its competitiveness in the global market,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "The Knesset moved to prohibit brothel operations nationwide, with officials stressing that prostitution will not disappear without coordinated action and local enforcement.\n\nThe Knesset’s Internal Affairs and Environment Committee has commenced action to ban the operations of brothels, the governing body announced on Sunday.\n\nCommittee chairman MK Yitzhak Kreuzer said that prostitution exists in the State of Israel and will not disappear without being properly addressed. In February 2025, Justice Minister Yariv Levin announced that a once-temporary law, which prohibited the consumption of prostitution, introduced in July 2020, became permanent.\n\nThe law made it illegal for individuals to purchase sex, with penalties ranging from administrative fines to criminal charges. These efforts were cited as efforts to combat human trafficking within Israel.\n\n\"There are authorities that deal with it, and there are those that ignore it, and in many cases, the phenomenon only worsens,” Kreuzer stated, adding that the topic was discussed following a request from Israeli NGO, Task Force on Human Trafficking and Prostitution.\n\nMoriah Rodel-Silfan, CEO of the organization, said in a statement that authorities can either ignore the issue or approach it head-on for a solution. She called on local authorities to act to eradicate the issue.\n\nLior Rosenbaum, a representative of the headquarters to combat trafficking of women, added that failing to act on the issue would only allow it to grow. Rosenbaum praised the Tel Aviv municipality for its successful fight against prostitution, resulting in the closure of brothels and discreet operations in the city.\n\nDeputy Mayor of Jerusalem Adir Schwartz told authorities in the Knesset that in Jerusalem, prostitution is largely concentrated on youth from the Haredi community, noting municipal plans and efforts to reduce prostitution.\n\nHealth Ministry representatives added that sex workers in Israel are not largely “street” workers, and outside enforcement would be needed to combat efforts.\n\nMaya Baron, Director of the Extreme Risk & Trauma Field at Israeli NGO ELEM, focused on youth in distress in Israel, noted the difference between prostitution in men and women in a statement. “Women engage in prostitution in discreet apartments, while men are on the street. Opening the doors of local authorities and acquiring the appropriate knowledge will enable assistance and response.\"\n\nDuring the meeting, MK Adi Aziz, among others, questioned police representatives about police raids on brothels and discreet apartments. She stated that raids were often not conducted in helpful manners to girls impacted; she cited a lack of social workers involved in the matter to assist survivors during the investigation and help them navigate alternative housing and rehabilitation.\n\nPolice representatives responded, stating that additional brothels would soon be closed through administrative orders, as well as additional efforts to be made in rehabilitation for survivors in cooperation with the Social Affairs Ministry.\n\nSurvivors testified in Knesset, including D. McCullough, who emphasized local authorities' role in combating prostitution. “The prostitution industry is not only a crime but also an industry, and if it has no way of making money, it will not operate. The local authorities have the power to strangle the prostitution industry economically, and that is enormous power,” McCullough told Knesset representatives.\n\n“If the brothel is masquerading as residential apartments, then the apartment is not operating according to its purpose, and therefore the brothel needs to be closed, and the more you close, the less profitable it will be for pimps to open in the city. Every brothel that is closed saves a lot of women and girls,” they added. “A brothel that closes saves the ugly spots from your city, so you should close them.\"",
