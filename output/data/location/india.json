A two-member team will look into IndiGo’s crew strength and utilization, fleet size, routes affected due to crew shortage and standby crew, while the second team will monitor the status of cancellations, on-time performance, refunds and baggage returns to fliers, the letter said.",

Here are some of their reactions:- Mumbai: 'Nothing is black or white' -At the seafront in India's Mumbai, 19-year-old Pratigya Jena scrolls with her friends through Instagram videos of a posing influencer and a camel at a beach.Social media \"should be partially banned because according to me nothing is either black or white\", the student said.\"Gen Z are very active, they are doing really well on social media.",
    "fullText": "Australia's landmark move to ban under-16s from social media will be closely watched by other countries, which could follow suit with similar laws.\n\n- Mumbai: 'Nothing is black or white' -\n\nAt the seafront in India's Mumbai, 19-year-old Pratigya Jena scrolls with her friends through Instagram videos of a posing influencer and a camel at a beach.\n\nSocial media \"should be partially banned because according to me nothing is either black or white\", the student said.\n\n\"Gen Z are very active, they are doing really well on social media. And doing great things, especially young entrepreneurs,\" Jena said.\n\nAt the same time, children watching adult content online \"has a very bad effect\".\n\nAt a Mumbai park, cricket coach Pratik Bhurke, 38, said Australia's move would encourage children to spend time outdoors and could have \"great benefits\" in India too.\n\nIn the chilly German capital, Luna Drewes, 13, is watching selfie-style TikTok clips posted by other young people.\n\n\"Actually a good thing in some ways because social media often portrays a certain image of how people should look, like girls have to be thin,\" she said of the ban.\n\nAnother teenager, Enno Caro Brandes, said: \"I'm 15 so for me the ban would definitely come into effect. I can't really imagine giving it up completely.\n\n\"A ban is a bit extreme, but it could definitely help to do a detox.\"\n\nAn AI baby singing and answering interview questions are among the videos served up to Firdha Razak, 16, as she scrolls in her room.\n\nRazak is not in favour of a ban. \"It's really stupid, honestly,\" although \"there's not really much we can do as 16-year-olds\" if governments decide to act, she said.\n\nThe families of many people in Qatar live abroad, so \"it's going to be so much harder to talk to them\".\n\nAlso in Doha, Youssef Walid, 16, said bans like Australia's were \"a bit harsh\" and hard to enforce.\n\n\"We can use VPN. We can easily bypass the security and easily make new accounts,\" he said.\n\n- Lagos: 'We were born with it' -\n\nAt a Nigerian high school, Mitchelle Okinedo is revising for exams, checking over her hand-written notes. In the classroom -- where phones are banned -- students in uniform sit at separate desks.\n\n\"I see where the (Australian) government is coming from. Students nowadays, they are really distracted,\" Okinedo said.\n\nEven so, \"we were born with it\", the 15-year-old added. \"And I don't think it's something I want to stop.\"\n\nHer mother, 50-year-old event planner Hannah Okinedo, agrees with a social media ban for under-16s, saying most parents \"don't have time to monitor their children all day\".\n\n- Mexico City: 'Express yourself' -\n\nYoung Mexico City resident Aranza Gomez, 11, has had a smartphone with access to social media for one year.\n\nWithout it, \"I would honestly feel sad. I wouldn't really have a good way to spend my time,\" she said.\n\nSantiago Ramirez Rojas, 16, is sitting on a bench in the Tabacalera district, scrolling through posts containing news about Argentina and tour dates for a musician.\n\n\"Social media today is very important for expressing yourself, no matter how old you are,\" said Rojas.\n\nBut \"there are many kidnappings that begin online\" and \"younger kids, around 10 or 12, are much more vulnerable\".\n\n- Sydney: 'Not going to have any impact' -\n\nIn Australia one family has diverging ideas on how the law will go.\n\n\"I don't think the government really knows what they're doing and I don't think it's going to have any impact on children of Australia,\" said 15-year-old Layton Lewis.\n\nBut his mother Emily Lewis hopes it will help children \"have better, more authentic relationships\".\n\n\"They'll make proper plans, like we used to, to meet up with their friends face-to-face and have proper conversations as opposed to these illusive friendships online,\" she said.",

    "fullText": "BENGALURU, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Amnesty International has said India's review of a telecom industry proposal to mandate always-on satellite ​location tracking on phones for better lawful surveillance was \"deeply concerning\" and puts data ‌of human rights defenders at risk.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's government has long pushed telecoms companies to give ‌more precise locations of individuals under investigation.\n\nThe telecoms operators say the best way to achieve this would be for the government to order smartphone manufacturers to permanently enable location tracking on phones. Reuters reported on Friday that the government is reviewing that proposal.\n\nThe discussions are ⁠being privately opposed by big ‌smartphone firms Apple, Google and Samsung, due to privacy and security concerns.\n\nIn a statement to Reuters, Amnesty International said location data can ‍be \"incredibly revealing\" and can expose personal and professional connections, such as the confidential sources who meet journalists or human rights groups.\n\n\"This is deeply concerning. At a time where surveillance scandals are a ​mushrooming global threat, states should be working on improving their practices and safeguards, not ‌forcing people to reveal yet more sensitive data,\" Amnesty said.\n\nIndia's IT and home ministries, which are reviewing the plan, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday about the backlash.\n\nAmnesty has in the past denounced India's surveillance practices including alleged use of Pegasus spyware to target journalists and activists -- allegations Modi's government has repeatedly denied.\n\nA fierce ⁠privacy debate erupted in India last week after ​Reuters first reported another confidential directive from the ​government to preload a state-run cyber safety app on all smartphones. India was forced to revoke the order following outcry from activists and politicians ‍over fears of snooping.\n\n\"Why ⁠are we out to convert India into a 'Surveillance State'?\" Senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala said on X, criticising the proposal to track phone locations.\n\nA large ⁠number of Indian users on X joined Surjewala and other privacy activists to condemn the plan, with ‌one user framing it as turning phones into \"digital ankle monitors\".",
