    "description": "India issues a final warning to Apple in its antitrust case, signaling action after delays over App Store practices.",
    "fullText": "India’s competition watchdog has issued a final warning to Apple in a long-running antitrust case. After more than a year of back-and-forth, the regulator says Apple’s repeated requests for more time are blocking the process.\n\nThe investigation began after a 2022 complaint from Match, the owner of Tinder, and several Indian startups. Regulators later concluded that Apple abused its position in the iOS app market. They then asked Apple to submit objections and share financial data needed to assess penalties.\n\nSince then, the case has stalled. Apple has sought multiple extensions and challenged how any fine would be calculated. As a result, the dispute has remained stuck in legal review.\n\nThe commission noted that it asked Apple in October 2024 to respond to the findings and provide key financial details. However, Apple kept asking for more time. The order states that this cannot continue and warns that the case will move forward even without Apple’s reply.\n\nApple says it could face a fine of up to $38 billion if regulators base penalties on its global revenue. Because of this, the company has challenged the penalty rules in court and asked to pause the antitrust case until judges rule on that issue.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Apple plans to wait for the next court hearing on January 27 before responding. A source familiar with the matter said Apple views the regulator’s move as an attempt to preempt the court process.\n\nIf Apple does not submit its response by the deadline set by the commission, the regulator says it will proceed on its own. That would bring the long-running dispute closer to a decision, even as Apple continues its legal challenge in court.",

    "fullText": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship and Bare Knuckle Fight League are making their official entry into India, marking a significant expansion into one of the world’s largest combat sports markets.\n\nThe move is being spearheaded by World League of Fighters, BKFC’s license holder, which is co-founded by Rajesh Banga, Sunil Mathew and Siraj Gill. The organization has brought in prominent film producer Parag Sanghvi and Bollywood star and martial artist Tiger Shroff to join the board alongside BKFC founder and president David Feldman and former two-division UFC champion Conor McGregor, who became a part-owner of BFKC in 2024.\n\nMiss Universe Harnaaz Sandhu Joins Tiger Shroff, Sanjay Dutt in 'Baaghi 4' - Global Bulletin\n\nNetflix, Amazon Prime, ZEE5, SonyLIV Vie for India's IFFI Streaming Honor - Global Bulletin\n\nFox Orders Lifeguard Drama Series 'Rescue: Hi-Surf' from Producer John Wells (TV News Roundup)\n\nWLF previously delivered a sold-out BKFC event in Dubai last year, which the organization describes as the biggest bare-knuckle fighting event held in the Middle East.\n\nThe India expansion will introduce a team-based bare-knuckle league format – marking the first time such a structure has been implemented in the history of the sport. The format will feature six inaugural teams: Crushers, Punishers, Warriors, Phantoms, Gladiators and Infernos, transforming individual fights into a franchise-based competition.\n\nRahul Saxena has been appointed CEO to lead the platform. He brings experience in scaling global brands to the role.\n\n“India is not just a market – it is the future of global combat sports,” Banga, Mathew and Gill said in a joint statement. “Together with BKFC, BKFL and WLF, we are building an ecosystem that will develop Indian fighters, create global stars and deliver world-class fight entertainment to millions of fans.”\n\nSanghvi positioned the venture as an opportunity to build a sports intellectual property from India with global reach. “This is where world-class storytelling meets raw, uncompromising sport,” he said. “With WLF, BKFC and Conor McGregor, we are not just launching a league – we are architecting a global sports IP from India that will command attention, talent and fandom worldwide.”\n\nFeldman emphasized India’s longstanding position in the organization’s expansion strategy. “India has been on our roadmap for a long time,” he said. “The scale, the energy, the culture — there is no place like it. With the leadership team we have assembled and our partnership with WLF, we are bringing the purest form of combat sports to a nation ready for it.”\n\nMcGregor, who serves as a global partner for BKFC, framed the expansion as transformative. “India has warriors in its DNA,” he said. “What we’re building with BKFC and BKFL in India will be something the world has never seen before. This is not just expansion – this is a revolution.”\n\nShroff, joining McGregor as a board member, highlighted the cultural significance of the venture. “Honored to stand alongside Conor McGregor as we create something truly historic for Indian sport,” he said. “This is more than a fight – it’s a global movement, and history is being written. Just like cinema, sport is a celebration of talent and skill, and Parag [Sanghvi] and I are committed to turning this into a landmark moment for India.”\n\nThe first official BKFC and BKFL team-based events are scheduled for 2026, with venue and fight card details to be announced.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nOscar Predictions: Original Screenplay — With Few Signals, 'Sinners' Takes an Early Lead\n\nOscar Predictions: ‘Sinners’ Could Shatter the All-Time Nomination Record as International Films Hope for Recognition\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week",

That’s what actually gets him into the zone. People outside think Virat is arrogant, but he is not. He gets into the zone.”\n\n“His attitude is amazing. His work ethics are amazing. He always wants to change, improve, and contribute for the team,” Rahane said.\n\nVirat Kohli’s career has been defined by the level of effort, commitment, and focus he has brought to every team and every format of the game.\n\nKohli’s focus has been a talking point among fans and critics for years, but teammates have often described it as a key part of his success.\n\nNow playing only limited-overs cricket, Kohli recently became the second-highest run-scorer in international history, with 28,068 runs, following a 93-run innings against New Zealand.\n\nRahane’s comments echo what many within the Indian setup have said before: Kohli’s intensity is often misread, but it’s that same approach that has helped him build one of the most impressive careers in modern cricket.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 11 (Reuters) - India proposes requiring smartphone makers to share source code with the government and make several software changes as part of a raft of security measures, prompting behind-the-scenes opposition from giants like Apple and Samsung.\n\nThe tech companies ​have countered that the package of 83 security standards, which would also include a requirement to alert the government to major software updates, ‌lacks any global precedent and risks revealing proprietary details, according to four people familiar with the discussions and a Reuters review of confidential government and industry documents.\n\nThe plan is part of Prime Minister Narendra ‌Modi's efforts to boost security of user data as online fraud and data breaches increase in the world's second-largest smartphone market, with nearly 750 million phones.\n\nIT Secretary S. Krishnan told Reuters that \"any legitimate concerns of the industry will be addressed with an open mind\", adding it was \"premature to read more into it\". A ministry spokesperson said it could not comment further due to ongoing consultation with tech companies on the proposals.\n\nONGOING TUG OF WAR OVER GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS\n\nApple, South Korea's Samsung, Google, China's Xiaomi and MAIT, the Indian ⁠industry group that represents the firms, did not respond ‌to requests for comment.\n\nIndian government requirements have irked technology firms before. Last month it revoked an order mandating a state-run cyber safety app on phones amid concerns over surveillance. But the government brushed aside lobbying last year and required rigorous testing for security ‍cameras over fears of Chinese spying.\n\nXiaomi and Samsung - whose phones use Google's Android operating system - hold 19% and 15%, respectively, of India's market share and Apple 5%, Counterpoint Research estimates.\n\nAmong the most sensitive requirements in the new Indian Telecom Security Assurance Requirements is access to source code - the underlying programming instructions that make phones work. This would be analysed and possibly ​tested at designated Indian labs, the documents show.\n\nThe Indian proposals also require companies to make software changes to allow pre-installed apps to be uninstalled and to ‌block apps from using cameras and microphones in the background to \"avoid malicious usage\".\n\n\"Industry raised concerns that globally security requirement have not been mandated by any country,\" said a December IT ministry document detailing meetings that officials held with Apple, Samsung, Google and Xiaomi.\n\nThe security standards, drafted in 2023, are in the spotlight now as the government is considering imposing them legally. IT ministry and tech executives are due to meet on Tuesday for more discussions, sources said.\n\nCOMPANIES SAY SOURCE CODE REVIEW, ANALYSIS 'NOT POSSIBLE'\n\nSmartphone makers closely guard their source code. Apple declined China's request for source code between 2014 and 2016, and U.S. law enforcement has also tried and failed to ⁠get it.\n\nIndia's proposals for \"vulnerability analysis\" and \"source code review\" would require smartphone makers to perform a \"complete ​security assessment\", after which test labs in India could check their claims through source code review and ​analysis.\n\n\"This is not possible ... due to secrecy and privacy,\" MAIT said in a confidential document drafted in response to the government proposal, and seen by Reuters. \"Major countries in the EU, North America, Australia and Africa do not mandate these requirements.\"\n\nMAIT asked the ministry last ‍week to drop the proposal, a source ⁠with direct knowledge said.\n\nThe Indian proposals would mandate automatic and periodic malware scanning on phones. Device makers would also have to inform the National Centre for Communication Security about major software updates and security patches before releasing them to users, and the centre would have the right to test them.\n\nMAIT's ⁠document says regular malware scanning significantly drains a phone's battery and seeking government approval for software updates is \"impractical\" as they need to be issued promptly.\n\nIndia also wants the phone's logs - digital records ‌of its system activity - to be stored for at least 12 months on the device.\n\n\"There is not enough room on device to store ‌1-year log events,\" MAIT said in the document.",

Companies say notice should be limited to \"highly critical\" permissions.\n\nDevices must store security audit logs, including ​app installations and login attempts, for 12 months.\n\nMAIT argues consumer phones lack the storage capacity ‌for a year of data.\n\nPhones must periodically scan for malware and identify potentially harmful applications.\n\nManufacturers warn that constant on-device scanning significantly drains the battery and slows hardware performance.\n\nOPTION TO REMOVE PRE-INSTALLED APPS:\n\nAll pre-installed apps bundled with the phone operating system, except those essential for basic phone functions, must be deletable.\n\nCompanies argue many apps are critical system components that cannot be ⁠removed.\n\nINFORMING GOVERNMENT OF MAJOR UPDATES:\n\nPhone makers must notify a ​government organisation before releasing any major updates or security ​patches.\n\nManufacturers argue this is \"impractical\" because security fixes must be released quickly to protect users from active exploits, while government delays could leave users vulnerable.\n\nDevices ‍must detect if phones have ⁠been rooted or \"jailbroken\", where users bypass built-in security restrictions, and display continuous warning banners to recommend corrective measures.\n\nCompanies say there is no reliable mechanism to detect jailbreaking.\n\nPhones ⁠must permanently block installation of older software versions, even if officially signed by the manufacturer, to prevent security ‌downgrades.\n\nThere is no global standard related to this requirement, manufacturers say.",

Around 3,500 pieces of content were blocked, and over 600 accounts were deleted. Going forward, X will not allow obscene imagery,\" government sources told news agency ANI.Govt Sends Notice To Elon Musk's X On Grok AI Chatbot Misuse, IT Ministry Seeks Action ReportThe Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) had raised concerns over obscene and harmful content allegedly generated by Elon Musk’s chatbot Grok. The ministry sent a letter to X (formerly Twitter), the social media website owned by Elon Musk, pointing out failures in moderating AI-generated content on its platform. The ministry highlighted concerns that the Grok and other services of xAI have been used to generate and distribute obscene or non-consensual images, particularly targeting the dignity and privacy of women. Through the letter, the government has also sought a report on the actions taken by the company, and the immediate removal of illegal materials.ALSO READ | AI tool to 'undress women': Grok under fire for generating non-consensual sexualised images; Musk pokes funNow, X has submitted a reply to the ministry, however, the officials described it as ‘not adequate’, saying the response by the social media platform lacked specific actions taken and preventive steps implemented.Earlier, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi had written to IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, urging the government to urgently step in over what she described as a disturbing rise in the misuse of AI tools to sexualise women on social media, particularly on X.In her letter, Priyanka Chaturvedi called for strict “guardrails” on AI chatbots such as Grok, saying social media platforms must be made “a safe space for women”. She also underlined the need for better education of men from an early age to prevent such behaviour.“Have sought urgent attention and intervention of the IT Minister to take the issue of increasing incidents of AI apps being prompted to sexualise and undress women by unauthorised use of their images on social media,” Chaturvedi said in a post on X.In the letter shared publicly, the Shiv Sena (UBT) leader flagged what she called an emerging trend on X, where men operating fake accounts allegedly upload photos of women and use AI prompts to minimise their clothing or sexualise them.“It is not just limited to sharing photos through fake accounts but are also targeting women who post their own photos,” she wrote.Calling the practice an “unacceptable and gross misuse of an AI function,” Chaturvedi also criticised Grok for “enabling this behaviour by adhering to such requests”.She described such acts as a “breach of women's right to privacy” and termed them “criminal”, adding that similar instances were “going absolutely unchecked” across other platforms as well.ALSO READ | Elon Musk's Grok AI restricts image editing features to paid X users after Deepfakes go viral across the world",

    "description": "As someone born and raised in India, I've seen a lot of first-time visitors make avoidable mistakes when planning trips, eating street food, and more.",
    "fullText": "As someone who's lived in India my whole life, I've seen it all: the chaos of a Delhi market at noon, the quiet streets of a Rajasthan village, and the seemingly endless railway platforms where people jostle for a spot on a train.\n\nVisitors often come expecting a single \"India experience,\" but having lived in big cities and small towns, I know that the country changes every few hundred miles.\n\nWith different cuisine and customs in every part of the country, it's no wonder first-time visitors to India are often unprepared. Here are the mistakes I see tourists make again and again — and how to avoid them.\n\nMany first-timers fly into Delhi, rush to Agra for the Taj Mahal, and then stop in Jaipur for forts and palaces, believing they've \"done India.\"\n\nThis route, known as the \"Golden Triangle,\" is iconic, but it's also one of the country's most crowded tourist circuits, where hourslong lines and heavy traffic can overshadow the experience.\n\nThat fast, checklist style of travel shows only one version of India: frenetic, historic, and packed with people.\n\nInstead, I'd recommend ditching the crowds and exploring other areas. Some of my favorite underrated parts of India include the cold deserts of Ladakh and Spiti.\n\nDon't skip rural India, either. Well over half of India's population lives in villages, and in my opinion, spending time in one can teach you more about the country than any monument.\n\nWalking through a small-town market and chatting with local families can give tourists a real sense of daily life.\n\nMany travelers try to see all of India in just one or two weeks, but getting from one city to another can take most of a day due to traffic, road conditions, or transportation delays.\n\nPlus, it'll be harder to enjoy everything India has to offer if you're frequently exhausted from a grueling travel experience.\n\nI believe it's better to focus on one city or state at a time.\n\nFor example, you can spend two weeks in Kerala exploring canals, stunning hills, and spice plantations; meanwhile, a trip to Rajasthan can include visits to many colorful cities and the fresco-rich Shekhawati region.\n\nMost travelers skip street food, fearing \"Delhi Belly\" — that is, traveler's diarrhea — but doing so means missing some of India's iconic local flavors.\n\nEach city has its specialties, from Mumbai's vada pav (a potato fritter between buns) to Varanasi's chaat (a savory street snack) to Kolkata's kathi rolls (a kebab rolled inside a flatbread with onions and sauce).\n\nTo enjoy street food safely, I recommend generally following the crowds, since high turnover usually means fresh food.\n\nI'd also suggest avoiding consuming anything cold or raw unless you can peel it yourself, and refraining from using ice unless it's made from bottled water — tap water isn't safe to drink here.\n\nIf you're nervous, you can also book a guided street-food tour. These are available in most major cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Jaipur, and Varanasi.\n\nIndia is famously hospitable: The Sanskrit saying \"Atithi Devo Bhava,\" or \"the guest is god,\" exists for a reason.\n\nThat said, paying attention to some basic customs doesn't take much effort, and it will likely make your interactions smoother and earn you some goodwill.\n\nAcross the country, it's respectful to remove shoes before entering temples or homes, and also to dress modestly, especially in rural areas and religious sites.\n\nI'd also recommend avoiding public displays of affection, as it can make some locals uncomfortable. Finally, use your right hand for eating or passing items, since the left is traditionally considered unclean.\n\nWith 28 states and eight union territories, India's customs can vary widely, so it's also wise to check local etiquette before your trip.\n\nSo much in India runs on WhatsApp messages and OTPs (one-time passwords), so you'll need a local SIM to pay for a cab ride or buy train tickets.\n\nI suggest buying a SIM card at the airport upon arrival, or using an eSIM. Preload it with enough data for your entire trip; adding more later can sometimes be tricky with foreign cards.\n\nWhile you're at it, take out some cash, too. The Indian rupee is our only official currency, and although many shops and restaurants accept digital payments, it's smart to carry cash for smaller vendors at local markets.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 8 (Reuters) - India's finance ministry plans to scrap five-year-old restrictions on Chinese firms bidding for government contracts, two sources said, as New Delhi seeks ​to revive commercial ties in an environment of eased diplomatic and border tensions.\n\nThe curbs, imposed in 2020 ‌after a deadly clash between the countries' troops, required Chinese bidders to register with an Indian government committee and obtain political and security clearances.\n\nThe ‌measures effectively barred Chinese firms from competing for Indian government contracts that were estimated to be worth $700 billion to $750 billion.\n\n\"Officials are working to remove the registration requirement for bidders from bordering nations,\" one government source said, declining to be named as they were not authorised to speak publicly.\n\nThe final decision will be made by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office, both the ⁠sources said.\n\nThe restrictions had a significant ‌impact: Months after they were unveiled, China's state-owned CRRC was disqualified from bidding for a $216 million train-manufacturing contract.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance's plan to ease curbs followed requests from other government departments ‍that are facing shortages and project delays due to the 2020 restrictions.\n\n\"Several ministries have requested exemptions to overcome the constraints that could derail projects in their sectors,\" the second government source said.\n\nSoon after India imposed its restrictions, the value of new projects awarded to ‌Chinese bidders fell 27% from a year earlier to $1.67 billion in 2021, according to a 2024 report from the Observer Research Foundation.\n\nSpecifically, curbs on imports from China of equipment for the power sector have hindered India's plans to raise its thermal power capacity to about 307 GW over the next decade.\n\nA high-level committee headed by a former cabinet secretary, Rajiv Gauba, has also recommended easing the restrictions. Gauba is now a member of a top government think tank.\n\nIndia's finance ministry ⁠and the prime minister's office did not respond to Reuters requests ​for comment.\n\nLast year, Modi visited China for the first time in ​seven years and agreed to foster deeper commercial ties with Beijing following U.S. President Donald Trump's 50% punitive tariff on Indian goods and in light of Washington's warming relations with Pakistan.",

    "description": "When Claire Drinkwater boarded a plane alone to India, she wondered if she'd finally lost her mind.",
    "fullText": "I used to love coming home from vacation.\n\nThe way the plane would swoop over London's skyscrapers and the River Thames before landing at Heathrow. Returning to my favorite places, people, and my job. Until one day, I burst into tears on a flight home from Italy.\n\nWhen I turned 30, I thought I had it all with a great career in London managing communications for TV networks. Then my long-term relationship ended. Suddenly, I had to find somewhere else to live and learn how to be alone again.\n\nMeanwhile, the job I loved became increasingly demanding. It all took its toll on my health. I felt sick every day: working late, eating sporadically, and waking in a panic at night. Nothing seemed to make a difference — not therapy, new hobbies, or healthier habits.\n\nOne day, friends invited me to go backpacking around Italy. It was the chance to escape my routine and get the fresh perspective I needed, so I joined them in Milan. Together, we explored the country by train: sleeping in hostels, slurping pasta, and dancing into the night.\n\nOn the plane home, watching Milan's russet roofs disappear under the clouds, I couldn't stop the tears. I wanted to stay, as this version of me, one who reminded me of my younger self. When I was a student, I used to walk past a travel agency near my university. I promised myself that one day I'd plan a big adventure. But I never had.\n\nThis spark ignited a long-dormant dream of traveling the world. I worried about abandoning the career I'd worked so hard to achieve. But I couldn't hold on any more to a life I'd fallen out of love with.\n\nI quit my job and booked a round-the-world route spanning nine countries across three continents.\n\nBoarding the plane alone to my first stop in India, I wondered if I'd finally lost my mind.\n\nOn my first morning, I awoke at a beachside yoga resort in Goa, India to the sound of the waves. Even there, so far from home, my anxiety had disturbed my sleep, as if I'd packed it in my backpack.\n\nBut over the next few weeks, practicing yoga and meditation calmed my body and mind. I learned to be spontaneous, to say yes to invitations, and to enjoy the moment. By the time I left a month later, I felt I was leaving behind a piece of my heart.\n\nMy next stop was Malaysia, where I took scuba diving lessons. Struggling to breathe underwater, I panicked and almost gave up. Eventually, I got the hang of it and even passed my diving certification. On my 33rd birthday, I arrived in Bali, where I learned to rest and relax.\n\nMy yearlong route took me to countries including New Zealand, where I got a temp job in communications, climbed volcanoes, and enjoyed barbecues on the beach with new friends. In Chile, I saw shooting stars over the Atacama Desert, as the vast universe looked down on our small planet.\n\nReturning to the UK, my plane circled over London. The city looked the same, but I was different. I had met a guy from Belgium toward the end of my trip; he had just begun his journey.\n\nWe got along so well that we ended up going on trips together and even visited each other in our home countries.\n\nWhen he got his old job back and moved home, I realized how much I'd miss him. So I faced a choice. Put down my roots again in the UK and try a long-distance relationship, or take a chance. I decided to trust myself one more time.\n\nOnce again, I packed my bags, this time for Belgium, a country I'd never considered living in.\n\nI didn't speak the languages and so much was different to what I was used to. But I made friends and rebuilt my communications career in Brussels.\n\nIt's been over 10 years, and we're still together, living in Belgium. Now I enjoy browsing the weekly markets or sitting on a terrace watching the world go by — even the slow service at restaurants that used to drive me mad. I still love to travel, and now I have someone to share the sunsets with and laugh with when things go wrong.\n\nI still get a happy tingle in my stomach when I travel back to London to visit, and that will never change.\n\nThat year taught me that home isn't only about where you're born. It's about where you feel comfortable, through the people and experiences that matter.\n\nYou can create a home more than once, in more than one place.\n\nDo you have a story about taking a gap year that you want to share?

    "fullText": "Amazon is allowing employees who are stranded in India because of visa delays to work remotely there until early March, according to an internal memo viewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe catch: They're not allowed to code, make strategic decisions, or interact with customers.\n\nAmazon is one of many American companies scrambling to adapt to the Trump administration's rapid-fire changes to the H-1B visa program, including a mandate that consular officers must review visa applicants' social media posts before issuing visas. The additional screening has delayed processing, and some embassies and consulates have rescheduled visa appointments by several months, leaving some employees stranded outside the country.\n\nThe delays have prompted Google, Apple, Microsoft, and other companies to issue travel advisories in recent weeks, warning US employees with visas to avoid international travel to prevent extended stays outside the US.\n\nAmazon allows employees traveling abroad for visa renewals to work remotely for up to 20 business days, an exemption from the normal requirement that they work in their office five days a week. Now, any Amazon employee in India as of December 13 and who awaits a rescheduled visa appointment may work remotely until March 2, according to the memo, which was posted to Amazon's internal HR portal on December 17.\n\nThe permission to work remotely comes with a long list of constraints. Employees working remotely from India are barred from coding of any kind, including troubleshooting and testing. They cannot work from or visit Amazon buildings. And they cannot negotiate or sign contracts.\n\n\"All reviews, final decision making, and sign offs should be undertaken outside India,\" the memo says.\n\nThe memo also said that \"in compliance with local laws, there are no exceptions to these restrictions.\"\n\nThe memo does not provide guidance for employees whose visa appointments have been rescheduled beyond March 2, 2026, or for those stranded in a different country. Some US embassies and consulates have rescheduled appointments as far out as 2027.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nFor employees in technical roles, the restrictions raised questions about what work they can actually perform.\n\n\"Seventy to eighty percent of my job is coding, testing, deploying, and documenting,\" one Amazon software engineer told Business Insider.\n\nA State Department spokesperson in December told Business Insider that the purpose of the social media reviews is to use \"all available tools\" to flag visa applicants who are inadmissible, including those who pose a risk to national interests.\n\nThe delays pose a particular challenge for Amazon, which is among the largest users of the H-1B program. During the 2024 government fiscal year, Amazon filed 14,783 certified H-1B applications, including 23 for Whole Foods, according to Business Insider's analysis of publicly available data from the Department of Labor and US Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Ashwini Gangal felt like a trailing spouse when she left her life in India behind to move to the US on a H-4 visa, as her husband's dependant.",
    "fullText": "My husband and I met on a dating app in 2021. He had moved to the US in 2009 and was in Mumbai, where I lived, to visit family.\n\nHis trip marked the start of our whirlwind intercontinental romance. In April 2022, after nearly a year of long-distance dating between the US and India, we got married in Mumbai, where I had spent all 36 years of my life. Nearly six months after the wedding, I moved from high-octane Mumbai to Sunnyvale, a sleepy suburb in San Francisco's Bay Area, leaving my job as the managing editor of an online business publication and bidding my friends and family goodbye. At the time, my husband worked in tech on an H-1B employment visa, which meant I could move to the US on an H-4 dependent spouse visa.\n\nWhen I got to the US, the heady joy of marital bliss was soon eclipsed by a crisis of identity. While I was glad to have found the man of my dreams à la Bollywood, I felt bitter about being a \"trailing spouse,\" moving to a new country for love, at the cost of professional stability. The busy editor who led a team of reporters in Mumbai quickly became an alter ego from a past life. Plus, I was incredibly lonely. It was only after roughly three years in the States that I began to think of Sunnyvale as home.\n\nAs a well-traveled Anglophone, I felt no culture shock when I arrived in America, with the exception of the \"do-it-yourself\" culture common to the Western world. I was a Bombay brat who always had house help to cook and clean for me. In the US, I tortured my gut bacteria with junk food for months before grudgingly learning my way around the kitchen.\n\nIn my head, I thought I'd only take a short break from work following my relocation. It took around six months after landing in the States to get my work authorization, known as the EAD, and then, I was all set to pick up my pen and notepad and return to work as a journalist.\n\nBut I found landing full-time work extremely difficult. Every day, I searched online job portals for journalism roles to apply to, but I was either ghosted or rejected every time.\n\nIsolation made these rejections harder to handle. Friendless \"visa brides,\" as I sometimes call immigrants of my ilk, have no one to share their burdens with.\n\nAlthough I did make friends over time, it was extremely difficult to connect with people initially, because loneliness is baked into suburban Californian life. In contrast to the throbbing metropolis of Mumbai, the Bay Area is quiet and boring, with vast distances between any two places of interest. It's not unusual to have to take multiple freeways to get to a grocery store or restaurant. Some roads don't even have footpaths for you to walk on. Public transport is a joke, so in these soulless suburbs, your car becomes a detachable extension of your body.\n\nA few months into my life in the Bay, I knew I was experiencing something that went beyond homesickness. I cried frequently, sometimes breaking down in public places. I slept badly, worried constantly, and lost my confidence. It felt like I was having a breakdown in slow motion.\n\nLearning how to drive, and getting my license in February 2023, was a big part of my emotional recovery. I'd always been afraid of driving, but now I've overcome it, I'm no longer dependent on my husband for transport. I have at long last befriended the asphalt.\n\nOne of my first long-distance drives was to a town called Turlock, nearly 100 miles from my place, where I did a live poetry reading.\n\nFinancially, I had to depend on my husband while I struggled to find work. But over the past three years, I've picked up some freelance writing assignments, which have granted me some financial freedom, and I've been able to lease my own car, a gorgeous black Tesla.\n\nI'm not the first \"visa wife,\" nor will I be the last. My story is the story of many women who've put oceans between themselves and their family, friends, and work, to move for love. My experience with immigration has taught me that when you move countries, your skills come with you, and if you believe in yourself, they can help you rebuild your professional identity.\n\nI'm proud to have strengthened my identity as a writer during this difficult time. I've written news articles for local outlets, works of fiction and poetry, and non-fiction essays based on my experience as an immigrant. For me, \"home\" is a place where people know my name, and building up professional recognition in the US has given me a greater sense of belonging.\n\nThat said, even though I've picked up temporary work, like contract jobs and freelance gigs, full-time employment remains elusive. I'm still actively looking for jobs, but I've come to believe that the struggle has less to do with my own abilities than imperfect algorithms on job portals, a volatile job market, and a general skew in the Bay Area toward software and technological skills, which makes me feel less in demand as a writer.\n\nI don't write code. I write stories. In \"Alf layla wa Layla,\" an ancient West Asian collection of folk tales, popularly known as \"The Arabian Nights,\" it takes princess Scheherazade a thousand nights to find the path to survival through storytelling.\n\nI fancy myself a modern-day Scheherazade in Sunnyvale, and, having lived as a writer in Silicon Valley for over a thousand days now, I think I'll survive too.\n\nDo you have a story to share about being on an H-4 or another dependent visa?

    "title": "I moved to the US from India. Here's how I landed a job at Microsoft after first misunderstanding the Big Tech hiring process.",
    "description": "Rishab Jolly moved to the US to get his MBA after starting his engineering career in India. He was hired at Microsoft in 2017 as a product manager.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rishab Jolly, a 37-year-old senior product manager at Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington. Business Insider has verified Jolly's employment history with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBefore moving to the US in 2015, I studied engineering and computer science in India, where I worked as both a software quality tester and an engineer.\n\nI was always interested in the business side of technology, so I left my job in India to pursue an MBA at the University of Arizona. My goal was to gain business acumen to complement my engineering background. I saw firsthand how much innovation takes place in the US and how many opportunities exist to work on cutting-edge products, which inspired me to build my career here.\n\nOne of the most valuable parts of the MBA program was its partnerships with Big Tech companies. As part of the curriculum, representatives from Microsoft, Amazon, and Google brought projects to campus.\n\nStudents formed teams, worked on deliverables, and were graded by company representatives. In 2016, I was team lead on a Microsoft project, and we did an excellent job. That gave me a chance to network and to demonstrate my skills to an actual Microsoft product manager.\n\nI applied to about 200 jobs, sending the same generic résumé without referrals. I received only three calls back and passed two interviews, but both offers were subsequently rescinded: one company considered my visa too risky without a STEM extension, and another cited budgetary reasons.\n\nI needed to secure a job within 60-90 days after graduation, or I would be forced to return to India. I ran out of money, asked a friend if I could crash on their couch, and felt a constant sense of anxiety.\n\nDuring that time, I stayed in touch with the Microsoft contact I'd met through my MBA project. When an opening came up, I asked if he would refer me.\n\nHe agreed, and I rewrote my résumé to match the specific role. The hiring manager liked my application, called me in, and I got a shot. That referral and tailoring my résumé made all the difference.\n\nI was hired by Microsoft in July 2017 and started as a product manager. I became a senior product manager in 2021.\n\nFirst, you have to get the interview, and second, you have to pass it. For the first step, referrals are critical. Big Tech companies receive tens of thousands of résumés every month. A referral can push yours to the top of the stack.\n\nTo prepare for interviews, I relied heavily on mock interviews. I reached out to peers who had been in the same boat and asked them to test me. They helped me refine my storytelling, practice answering metrics-driven questions, and pinpoint areas for improvement.\n\nWhen I finally interviewed at Microsoft, the feedback I received was that my stories were authentic and clearly based on real experiences. That authenticity resonated far more than rehearsed answers pulled from the internet.\n\nIn today's tech world, showcasing your skills outside work or school, whether on LinkedIn, GitHub, or through personal projects, demonstrates passion and initiative.\n\nI started posting more consistently on LinkedIn during the pandemic. I shared lessons from my career, thoughts on product management, and observations about the industry. I wasn't trying to \"build a following,\" I just focused on topics that genuinely resonated with me.\n\nOver time, those posts resonated with others, and a community naturally formed around them. The growth happened gradually and organically, simply because people connected with the ideas and conversations.\n\nRecruiters notice when you go beyond the curriculum to learn new tools or contribute to open-source projects. In a fast-changing industry where AI and new technologies emerge every six months, demonstrating your ability to adapt and self-learn is as important as the content of your résumé.\n\nWhile a small percentage of jobs may prefer an MBA, I know successful product managers who came from accounting, English literature, or completely different areas. Microsoft values diverse backgrounds because innovation thrives when teams bring fresh perspectives.\n\nEven with this knowledge, I would still pursue an MBA because it was not just about academics; it was also about gaining practical experience. It provided me with exposure to new perspectives, helped me transition into product management, and connected me with mentors and peers who have shaped my career in meaningful ways.\n\nI don't think an MBA is mandatory for everyone. It depends on your goals and whether you're looking for a career pivot, a network, or structured learning.\n\nVisa restrictions, financial pressure, and cultural adjustments can make the experience stressful. I had moments when I felt defeated, but staying focused and working smart eventually brought everything together.\n\nAfter over eight years at Microsoft, I plan to continue contributing to the technology and innovation ecosystem. I'm exploring the appropriate pathways that align with my career goals, but nothing is finalized at this time. My focus is on the work itself and continuing to grow professionally.\n\nMy advice to anyone following a similar path is straightforward: network strategically, prepare thoroughly, stay authentic, and continually build your skills and presence. Things may look uncertain now, but persistence and the right relationships can open doors you didn't think were possible.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI (AP) — A protest erupted in India’s capital Tuesday in response to the death of a Hindu man who was lynched and burned by an angry mob in neighboring Bangladesh, a new sign of strain in relations between the neighboring countries.\n\nThe protest in New Delhi, mainly led by Hindu nationalist organization Vishva Hindu Parishad, highlights the fragility in the relationship between India and Bangladesh, which often is held up as a rare example of stability in South Asia.\n\nBangladeshi student leader Sharif Osman Hadi died in a hospital in Singapore on Thursday after being shot on Dec. 12 in Dhaka. Police in Bangladesh said they identified suspects and the shooter likely had fled to India.\n\nHadi’s death triggered widespread violence in Dhaka. The offices of two national daily newspapers were torched and Indian diplomatic missions were targeted. A Hindu man also was burned alive, which sparked the protest Tuesday in India.\n\nHundreds of demonstrators gathered Tuesday near the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi, shouting slogans and accusing Bangladeshi groups of wrongly targeting minorities. They carried placards and banners with slogans including “India will not tolerate torture of Hindus in Bangladesh” and “Our silence should not be mistaken as weakness, we are lions.”\n\nAuthorities erected barricades and imposed tight security around the diplomatic enclave that included police and armored vehicles. Security personnel used batons to hold back some protesters who broke through barricades in an apparent attempt to enter the embassy.\n\nOne of the Indian protestors, Rajkumar Jindal, threatened “dire consequences” if authorities in Bangladesh failed to stop violence against Hindus.\n\n“People who are committing atrocities should stop doing that. We are here to awaken the people who are asleep,” Jindal said.\n\nHadi took part in a 2024 political uprising that ended the 15-year rule of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who has been in exile since fleeing Bangladesh on Aug. 5, 2024. He was a fierce critic of India and Hasina and planned to run as an independent candidate in a major constituency in Dhaka in the next national elections in February.\n\nHadi's death sparked a new diplomatic squabble with India and prompted New Delhi this week to summon Bangladesh’s envoy.\n\nBangladesh’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also summoned Pranay Verma, the Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh, to apprise him of the security situation at Bangladesh missions in New Delhi and state capitals Kolkata and Agartala, a leading Bengali-language newspaper reported Tuesday.\n\nTensions between India and Bangladesh increased again with the death on Thursday of Dipu Chandra Das, a 25-year-old Hindu man who was lynched and burned publicly following allegations of blasphemy in Mymensingh district’s Bhaluka subdistrict.\n\nDas's killing contributed to a pattern of fear among the Hindu community in Bangladesh following the ouster of Hasina.\n\nReligious minority groups including Hindus and Christians have accused Bangladesh's interim government headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus of failing to protect the safety of Hindus and others. The Yunus administration has rejected the allegations.\n\nTuesday's protest could complicate cooperation on trade, border management and regional connectivity at a time when the region is already grappling with economic uncertainty and political polarization, said Sreeram Sundar Chaulia, an international affairs expert at New Delhi’s Jindal School of International Affairs.\n\n“Opposing India and alleging Indian conspiracies of interference in Bangladesh are being done in order to harden a blatantly Islamist and non-inclusive path for the country,” Chaulia said.\n\nThe rupture is a setback to India’s broader regional strategy, while for Bangladesh the loss of India’s development assistance and markets could further dampen the country's slowing economy and push it further into dependence on China, Chaulia said.\n\nBangladesh and India have enjoyed a warm relationship since 2009 when Hasina came to power and until her ouster. Hasina was considered a friend by India and both countries thrived on bilateral cooperation. But Hasina’s opponents accused her administration of being subservient to India, a major trade and investment partner.",

But the government has been Hasina’s Awami League party, which is one of two major political parties. ,\n\nHasina’s archrival, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party is the other key party, which hopes to forms the next government. The Jamaat-e-Islami party, the country’s largest Islamist party with a dark history involving the nation’s independence war in 1971, is leading an alliance to carve out a bigger political space in the absence of Hasina’s party and its allies.\n\nHasina has been sentenced to death on charges of crimes against humanity, but India's has not responded to repeated requests by the Yunus-led government for her extradition.",

Railway tracks in the state are frequented by elephants, but Indian Railways said in a statement the accident location wasn't a designated elephant corridor.\n\nThe Rajdhani Express train, traveling from Sairang in Mizoram state bordering Myanmar, was bound for the national capital of New Delhi with 650 passengers onboard when it hit with elephants.\n\n“We delinked the coaches which were not derailed, and the train resumed its journey for New Delhi. Around 200 passengers who were in the five derailed coaches have been moved to Guwahati in a different train,” Sharma said.\n\nSpeeding trains hitting wild elephants is not rare in Assam, which is home to an estimated 7,000 wild Asiatic elephants, one of the highest concentrations of the pachyderm in India. Since 2020, at least a dozen elephants have been killed by speeding trains across the state.\n\nWild elephants often stray into human habitations this time of year, when rice fields are ready for harvesting.",

    "title": "When Red in the US Is Green in India – The AQI Disparity Problem",
    "description": "AirGradient air quality monitoring.",
    "fullText": "If you look at an air quality map of India, you’ll find that the map looks completely different depending on whether you’re in India or the US. This stems from the major disparities that exist between national air quality indices (AQIs), which use different categorization labels, benchmarks, and colours to denote air quality.\n\nIndia’s National Air Quality Index (NAQI), as seen above on the left, reveals mostly green and yellow clusters, representing “satisfactory” and “moderate” air. For the same exact clusters measured in the same period, using the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) AQI, seen on the right, will show mostly orange and red. These represent “unhealthy for sensitive groups” or generally “unhealthy” air, signalling a significantly higher level of concern.\n\nHere we can see the difference between the categories of these two AQIs – India’s NAQI on the left, and the US AQI on the right. NAQI’s “good” and “satisfactory” standards cover two separate categories, seen here on the AirGradient map legend in two shades of green. For those without a careful eye for detail, this can make a “satisfactory” cluster be mistaken for a “good” one.\n\nThis further highlights the difficulty of comparing cross-country indices; greens, oranges, and reds don’t automatically correspond, and can even be split within one index.\n\nIn its 2021 air quality guidelines, the World Health Organization (WHO) says that a 24-hour average PM2.5 concentration above 15 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) is already beyond its recommended limit. India’s system, in contrast, sets the comparable 24-hour threshold of PM2.5 at 60 µg/m3, which is four times higher.\n\nHowever, India is far from being alone in exceeding this limit. China sets its limit at 75 µg/m3, the European Union at 50 µg/m3, the US at 35 µg/m3, and Canada at 28 µg/m3, just to name a few.\n\nFrom a health perspective, the implications are striking: two people breathing air with the same level of PM2.5 in two different countries could be told very different stories about how safe that air is. This gap silently shapes how millions of people understand the air they breathe, and can influence the activities they undertake in their day-to-day lives. For example, recommendations related to prolonged and strenuous outdoor activities are particularly important, seeing as exercise poses additional health risks due to the increased uptake and deposit of pollutants in the lungs.\n\nAfter all, WHO guidelines remain advisory, and hence, governments have no legal obligation to abide by them. However, they are formulated by expert committees with the aim of informing local policymaking.\n\nFirstly, there’s a technological disparity to note, as countries use different types of reference grade monitors as the ‘official’ norm, which measure air pollution differences. India’s official monitors use beta attenuation monitors (BAMs), which physically weigh particles and require regular maintenance and biyearly calibration, whereas many private platforms use low-maintenance sensor-based devices that rely on laser scattering. BAMs are more accurate and better suited for measuring higher concentrations, which fits with India’s local context. However, without the regular maintenance required, this advantage may be negated, and the accuracy of the data reported may in fact suffer.\n\nAccording to Gufran Beig, founder director of India’s national air quality monitoring system SAFAR, “every country has built its index based on its own adaptability, weather and local environment”. India’s Northern Plain, for example, experiences natural dust storms. These increase both coarse and fine particulate matter concentrations in the ambient air, which cause conditions to exceed the WHO limit. Adopting this standard in these locations would classify air as polluted even without human activity.\n\nThe Indian Environment Ministry raises another point regarding the need to account for “socio-economic status and national circumstances”. While the country is striving to transition towards cleaner alternatives in accordance with the National Action Plan on Climate Change, most of the energy consumed in India is derived from fossil fuels, particularly coal. Meanwhile, the combustion of coal, petrol, diesel, gas, biomass, and waste accounts for 81% of PM2.5 pollution. Therefore, reducing air pollution would logically entail targeting this sector. If India were to strictly adhere to international standards, it would require an overhaul of its energy production systems, transportation, and construction, and would incur significant job losses in the fossil fuel sector. This would impact economic growth and development goals, yielding social and political challenges.\n\nShould there be a standardized international index, or should we allow for cross-country variation?\n\nOn one hand, a stricter index aligned with WHO limits might better reflect health risks and allow for comparable scales, but would expose the severity of a problem that is expensive and politically costly to fix. On the other, a looser index can account for local contexts, and reduce public alarm and short-term political pressure. However, this may come at the cost of long-term passivity.\n\nAt AirGradient, we are grappling with this question ourselves. On our mobile app, which features a map that visualizes real-time air quality data, users can select to display values either as raw concentration values (µg/m³) or using the U.S. EPA Air Quality Index (AQI) scale.\n\nShould we also integrate other national indices such as India’s NAQI? This would allow us to reach a larger audience and adapt to what users are familiar with, but would also mean shaping norms towards an acceptance of indices that may be misinforming their users of the real health risks.\n\nYou can download the AirGradient map and test out the index displays here: App Store / Play Store\n\nCentral Pollution Control Board.

    "fullText": "Lionel Messi made headlines for all the wrong reasons on Saturday when his three-day tour of India descended into violence.\n\nThe Argentina legend was visiting the city of Kolkata at the start of a whistle-stop visit taking in four cities.\n\nMany of Messi's fans were left feeling short-changed when they failed to get a glimpse of one of the world's most famous players.\n\nIt was the first time Messi had been to India since 2011.\n\nThis is how his visit played out.\n\nFresh from helping Inter Miami win the MLS Cup for the first time, Messi was embarking on a promotional tour.\n\nIt was called the GOAT India Tour 2025 - GOAT meaning 'greatest of all time'.\n\nMessi was joined by Uruguay star Luis Suarez and Argentina's Rodrigo de Paul, who also play for Inter Miami.\n\nThe tour started in Kolkata on Saturday. The trio moved on to Hyderabad later that day, then to Mumbai on Sunday before finishing in New Delhi on Monday.\n\nIndia was the only country the tour visited.\n\nThere was a variety of ticket options to suit budgets.\n\nFor access to the stadium only, face value tickets cost 3,500 rupees (£29) for Kolkata and Hyderabad. For New Dehli, the price was 4,200 rupees (£35).\n\nHowever, this is about half the average weekly wage in India. But with tickets sold out, fans were paying much more for the chance to see Messi.\n\nReports in Indian media said some locals had paid up to 12,000 rupees (£99) to get in.\n\nAmong the other ticket types was a VVIP option which included a meet-and-greet with Messi, including a photograph. Only 100 were available at a price of one million rupees (£8,200).\n\nMessi landed in Kolkata at 01:30 local time. Thousands lined the roads and congregated outside his hotel to catch a glimpse of him.\n\nThe day began with the meet-and-greet ticket holders first up from 09:00 to 10:30.\n\nThen the day took a strange twist.\n\nA 70ft statue of Messi lifting the World Cup was unveiled by the former Barcelona icon.\n\nBut he was not present - it was a virtual unveiling. He was on a video screen and pressed a button on a remote control. At this point a blue sheet dropped to reveal the huge iron structure.\n\nMessi met with Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan before heading to Salt Lake Stadium for 11:30.\n\nThe plan was for him to be at the ground for an hour. He was gone after only 20 minutes and violence erupted because ticket holders did not get to see Messi among the throng of security, politicians and celebrities.\n\n\"Only leaders and actors were surrounding Messi. Why did they call us then? We have got a ticket for 12,000 rupees, but we were not even able to see his face,\" a fan at the stadium told Indian news agency ANI.\n\nOne angry supporter told the Press Trust of India news agency that people had paid the equivalent of a month's salary to see the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner.\n\n\"I paid 5,000 rupees for the ticket and came with my son to watch Messi, not politicians,\" they said.\n\n\"The police and military personnel were taking selfies, and the management is to blame.\"\n\nThere was supposed to be a friendly match, more of kickabout, with some local players but this did not happen.\n\nMessi was whisked off to Hyderabad.\n\nMessi walked out at the stadium waving to fans, but after his appearance was abruptly ended some frustrated supporters stormed the pitch and vandalised banners and tents, while others hurled plastic chairs and water bottles.\n\nWest Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said she was \"deeply disturbed and shocked\" by the events.\n\nAnnouncing an enquiry, Banerjee apologised to Messi and \"sports lovers\" for the scenes at the stadium.\n\n\"The [enquiry] committee will conduct a detailed enquiry into the incident, fix responsibility, and recommend measures to prevent such occurrences in the future,\" she added on X.\n\nA spokesperson for Messi said he fulfilled the time commitment that had been agreed in advance. In terms of the organisation of the event itself, he referred the BBC to the apology issued by Banerjee on social media.\n\nKolkata's Telegraph newspaper said in an editorial piece that \"poor management of a hyped-up event, lack of co-ordination\" and security lapses turned the stadium into a \"battlefield\".\n\nSatadru Dutta, the event organiser, was arrested and a city court remanded him in police custody for 14 days.\n\nThe rest of the tour appears to have gone without a hitch, with fans getting to see Messi, Suarez and De Paul.\n\nThe Times of India reported how the event in Hyderabad went smoothly, with the stands full and Messi staying on the pitch for a full hour.\n\nAfter leaving Hyderabad, on Sunday Messi met with India cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar in Mumbai.\n\nFog delayed their arrival into Dehli on Monday, where thousands of fans gathered inside New Delhi's Arun Jaitley Stadium and were treated to a half-hour appearance when the trio kicked balls into the stands, passed balls with a group of children and signed autographs.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Football superstar Lionel Messi has wrapped up his three-day India tour in pollution-choked Delhi, after a chaotic opening in Kolkata.\n\nOn Monday, thousands of fans gathered in a Delhi stadium to get a glimpse of the Argentina and Inter Miami forward.\n\nAs Messi, accompanied by Inter Miami team-mates Luis Suárez and Rodrigo De Paul, strolled on the pitch - kicking balls into the stands, passing with a group of children and signing autographs - the crowd chanted his name.\n\nHis flight from Mumbai had been delayed due to fog, local media reported, and his itinerary had to be trimmed. On Saturday angry fans vandalised a Kolkata stadium because they didn't get to see him during his appearance there.\n\nMessi had a packed schedule in India, attending a string of promotional events in Kolkata, Hyderabad and Mumbai since arriving in the early hours of Saturday.\n\nBefore heading to Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium later that day, he virtually unveiled a 70ft (21m) statue of himself, assembled over 27 days by a 45-strong crew in the eastern city.\n\nThe tour, however, got off to a disastrous start after angry fans ripped up seats and threw items towards the pitch at the stadium.\n\nFootball is hugely popular in West Bengal state - of which Kolkata is the capital - and thousands of adoring supporters had paid up to 12,000 rupees (£100; $133) to attend the event.\n\nHowever, most of them didn't even get to see him as he was surrounded by officials and celebrities on his brief walk around the stadium and then quickly whisked away as the situation turned hostile.\n\nKolkata's The Telegraph newspaper said in an editorial that \"poor management of a hyped-up event, lack of co-ordination\" and security lapses turned the stadium into a \"battlefield\", as fans - denied even a glimpse of Messi - \"vented their anger by indulging in violence\".\n\nThe ruckus, which made international headlines, cast a shadow over Messi's first visit to India since 2011 for what has been called a 'GOAT [greatest of all time] tour'.\n\nThe event organiser in Kolkata has been arrested, police said, and a city court has remanded Satadru Dutta to 14 days in police custody.\n\nMessi's visits to Hyderabad and Mumbai passed off smoothly, with fans sharing their delight at seeing the global icon online and in media interviews.\n\nMessi also met several politicians and celebrities - Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan in Kolkata (at his hotel before the stadium fiasco), opposition leader Rahul Gandhi in Hyderabad, and cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar in Mumbai.\n\nIn between these interactions, Messi could be seen waving to large fan gatherings in stadiums and dribbling the ball with groups of children.\n\nThere were reports earlier that Messi would meet Narendra Modi in Delhi, but the Indian prime minister left the country on Monday morning on a scheduled visit to Jordan, Ethiopia and Oman.\n\nMessi's popularity stems not just from his long international career and wide TV coverage of European football - he's record scorer for Barcelona, the team he used to play for - but also the emotional connection that millions of Indians have with what is often called the beautiful game.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "fullText": "An all-new Croft adventure, Tomb Raider Catalyst, will be released in 2027 – and a remake of the action heroine’s first adventure arrives next year\n\nAfter a long break for Lara Croft, a couple of fresh Tomb Raider adventures are on their way. They will be the first new games in the series since 2018, and both will be published by Amazon.\n\nAnnounced at the Game Awards in LA, Tomb Raider Catalyst stars the “charismatic, self-assured, formidable Lara Croft” from the original 1990s games, says game director Will Kerslake. It’s set in the markets, mountains, and naturally the ancient buildings of northern India, where Lara is racing with other treasure hunters to track down potentially cataclysmic artefacts. It will be out in 2027.\n\nCatalyst is in development at Crystal Dynamics, the Canadian developer that has looked after Tomb Raider since 2003. Crystal Dynamics previously developed Tomb Raiders Legend, Anniversary and Underworld, as well as the reboot trilogy that featured a younger, more vulnerable Lara. Its most recent game in the series was 2018’s Shadow of the Tomb Raider.\n\nTomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, meanwhile, is being developed in collaboration with Flying Wild Hog in Poland. Featuring modernised combat and redesigned tomb-delving puzzles, the game is an “expanded” ground-up reimagining of Lara Croft’s very first 1996 adventure, which established her as one of gaming’s most recognisable characters. “Our goal was to respect the spirit of Core Design’s original game, while updating the experience for today’s gamers including building it with Unreal Engine 5,” Kerslake says. “We see this is a reimagining of the original game with a gameplay experience that wasn’t possible on the technology at the time.” Legacy of Atlantis will be out in 2026.\n\nIn both games, Croft will be played by the British actor Alix Wilton Regan, who previously had significant roles in Dragon Age: Inquisition and Cyberpunk 2077. She was also due to star as Joanna Dark in the cancelled remake of 2000’s spy-shooter Perfect Dark.\n\nDespite the series’ recent hiatus, Tomb Raider still has immense brand recognition, built on its 1990s heyday. Amazon also has a TV series in the works with Phoebe Waller-Bridge, which is to star Sophie Turner as Croft. Over 30 years, Croft has been everything from Playboy pin-up to rugged wilderness adventurer to gentlewoman action hero.\n\n“Across the series, our goal is to show that Lara is always evolving,” Kerslake says. “Her core DNA will remain, but we believe it’s important to show how each adventure shapes her character over time.”",

Today we look at:Good morning, this is Ashutosh Joshi, an equities reporter in Mumbai. The Fed’s 25-basis-point cut has taken one big global worry off the table, and regional markets are cheering the move. Whether that’s enough to steady Indian equities is unclear after Wednesday’s late slide pulled the market to a near month-low. Mid- and small-cap stocks may get some relief from the regulator allowing pension funds to invest in the Nifty 250 and BSE 250 indices. But with the outlook on a trade deal with Washington still murky and bond yields climbing to three-month highs — pressuring the rupee — investors are watching how long India can hold out against the global “lower for longer” narrative. Also in focus will be monthly mutual fund inflows numbers amid chatter that retail investors are running out of patience.",

And doing great things, especially young entrepreneurs,\" Jena said.\n\nAt the same time, children watching adult content online \"has a very bad effect\".\n\nAt a Mumbai park, cricket coach Pratik Bhurke, 38, said Australia's move would encourage children to spend time outdoors and could have \"great benefits\" in India too.\n\nIn the chilly German capital, Luna Drewes, 13, is watching selfie-style TikTok clips posted by other young people.\n\n\"Actually a good thing in some ways because social media often portrays a certain image of how people should look, like girls have to be thin,\" she said of the ban.\n\nAnother teenager, Enno Caro Brandes, said: \"I'm 15 so for me the ban would definitely come into effect. I can't really imagine giving it up completely.\n\n\"A ban is a bit extreme, but it could definitely help to do a detox.\"\n\nAn AI baby singing and answering interview questions are among the videos served up to Firdha Razak, 16, as she scrolls in her room.\n\nRazak is not in favour of a ban. \"It's really stupid, honestly,\" although \"there's not really much we can do as 16-year-olds\" if governments decide to act, she said.\n\nThe families of many people in Qatar live abroad, so \"it's going to be so much harder to talk to them\".\n\nAlso in Doha, Youssef Walid, 16, said bans like Australia's were \"a bit harsh\" and hard to enforce.\n\n\"We can use VPN. We can easily bypass the security and easily make new accounts,\" he said.\n\n- Lagos: 'We were born with it' -\n\nAt a Nigerian high school, Mitchelle Okinedo is revising for exams, checking over her hand-written notes. In the classroom -- where phones are banned -- students in uniform sit at separate desks.\n\n\"I see where the (Australian) government is coming from. Students nowadays, they are really distracted,\" Okinedo said.\n\nEven so, \"we were born with it\", the 15-year-old added. \"And I don't think it's something I want to stop.\"\n\nHer mother, 50-year-old event planner Hannah Okinedo, agrees with a social media ban for under-16s, saying most parents \"don't have time to monitor their children all day\".\n\n- Mexico City: 'Express yourself' -\n\nYoung Mexico City resident Aranza Gomez, 11, has had a smartphone with access to social media for one year.\n\nWithout it, \"I would honestly feel sad. I wouldn't really have a good way to spend my time,\" she said.\n\nSantiago Ramirez Rojas, 16, is sitting on a bench in the Tabacalera district, scrolling through posts containing news about Argentina and tour dates for a musician.\n\n\"Social media today is very important for expressing yourself, no matter how old you are,\" said Rojas.\n\nBut \"there are many kidnappings that begin online\" and \"younger kids, around 10 or 12, are much more vulnerable\".\n\n- Sydney: 'Not going to have any impact' -\n\nIn Australia one family has diverging ideas on how the law will go.\n\n\"I don't think the government really knows what they're doing and I don't think it's going to have any impact on children of Australia,\" said 15-year-old Layton Lewis.\n\nBut his mother Emily Lewis hopes it will help children \"have better, more authentic relationships\".\n\n\"They'll make proper plans, like we used to, to meet up with their friends face-to-face and have proper conversations as opposed to these illusive friendships online,\" she said.",

    "fullText": "BENGALURU, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Amnesty International has said India's review of a telecom industry proposal to mandate always-on satellite ​location tracking on phones for better lawful surveillance was \"deeply concerning\" and puts data ‌of human rights defenders at risk.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's government has long pushed telecoms companies to give ‌more precise locations of individuals under investigation.\n\nThe telecoms operators say the best way to achieve this would be for the government to order smartphone manufacturers to permanently enable location tracking on phones. Reuters reported on Friday that the government is reviewing that proposal.\n\nThe discussions are ⁠being privately opposed by big ‌smartphone firms Apple, Google and Samsung, due to privacy and security concerns.\n\nIn a statement to Reuters, Amnesty International said location data can ‍be \"incredibly revealing\" and can expose personal and professional connections, such as the confidential sources who meet journalists or human rights groups.\n\n\"This is deeply concerning. At a time where surveillance scandals are a ​mushrooming global threat, states should be working on improving their practices and safeguards, not ‌forcing people to reveal yet more sensitive data,\" Amnesty said.\n\nIndia's IT and home ministries, which are reviewing the plan, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday about the backlash.\n\nAmnesty has in the past denounced India's surveillance practices including alleged use of Pegasus spyware to target journalists and activists -- allegations Modi's government has repeatedly denied.\n\nA fierce ⁠privacy debate erupted in India last week after ​Reuters first reported another confidential directive from the ​government to preload a state-run cyber safety app on all smartphones. India was forced to revoke the order following outcry from activists and politicians ‍over fears of snooping.\n\n\"Why ⁠are we out to convert India into a 'Surveillance State'?\" Senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala said on X, criticising the proposal to track phone locations.\n\nA large ⁠number of Indian users on X joined Surjewala and other privacy activists to condemn the plan, with ‌one user framing it as turning phones into \"digital ankle monitors\".",
