    "title": "‘Time to pull our sleeves up’: India coach Ryan ten Doeschate hints at playing XI shake-up after Super 8 defeat",
    "description": "Following a heavy defeat to South Africa in Super 8s, India's batting unit faces scrutiny, with assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate confirming that changes, including the potential inclusion of Sanju Samson, are being considered. The team's left-hand heavy top order has struggled, prompting a rethink of their strategy for upcoming crucial matches.",
    "fullText": "Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. \n\nIndia’s left-hand heavy top order once again crumbled under pressure during the chase of 188, eventually collapsing to 111. The spotlight fell heavily on out-of-form opener Abhishek Sharma, who managed just 15 — his first runs of the tournament after three consecutive ducks — and Tilak Varma, whose struggles have compounded India’s fragile starts.\n\nAddressing the selection dilemma, ten Doeschate acknowledged that bringing in a right-hand option like Samson is under serious consideration.\n\n“Yeah, of course, we have looked at the five outings we have had now, four teams have opened with part-time off spin, and it has got a wicket every time, apart from the USA game where we lost Abhi without score in any case (to pacer Ali Khan),” he said.\n\n“So to start every inning zero for one, I think it has literally been zero or a couple of runs for one every time is obviously putting pressure on the link players. Tilak and SKY (Surya), their role is to link up with the guys at the back end, and it has not gone that way,” he added.\n\n128703198Advertisement\nIndia now face a tough call between backing struggling players and making bold changes.\n\n“You stick with the guys who we feel have performed really well over the last 18 months and who are maybe shy of a few runs now? Or do we twist and bring Sanju, who is also a fantastic player and obviously helps tactically with having a right-hander at the top of the order, and I am sure that will be a talking point over the next few days, going into these two very important games,” he said.\n\nTen Doeschate also revealed that Abhishek’s poor run has been compounded by illness.\n\n“You want him to be up and running and sort of confident in his swing and confident in his game plan (on Abhishek), and when you score three zeroes, that is going to start weighing on you. I saw some really good signs on Friday night in the nets. I think I mentioned it in the presser then. But he looks a little bit short, and our job as the coaching staff is to pull that right. We have got four days to do that,” he added.\n\nHe also defended Rinku Singh, whose returns as finisher have been modest.\n\n“There is no point talking about rhythm in nets or how guys are feeling or what they are not feeling. It is time to pull our sleeves up and get performance out of all the players, and like I just said there, that is the challenge for the staff, along with the players now, to regroup and put in a big effort leading up to the next game against Zimbabwe,” he concluded.",

    "fullText": "Defending T20 World Cup champions India need \"two big performances\" to reach the semi-finals after Sunday's huge defeat to South Africa, said their assistant coach.\n\nIndia came into the T20 World Cup as hot favourites on home soil but were thrashed by 76 runs in the Super Eights as 80,000 fans at the massive Narendra Modi stadium were stunned into silence.\n\nIn their first chase of the tournament, India's batting came up woefully short in the face of some disciplined South Africa bowling.\n\nIndia collapsed to 111 all out in 18.5 overs in response to South Africa's 187-7 as their 12-match win streak in the T20 World Cup came to a crashing end.\n\nThe magnitude of the defeat has left India with a desperate net run-rate of -3.8 and likely needing to win their last two Super Eight matches convincingly to make it to the semi-finals.\n\nAnything less and India will need to rely on a combination of other results going their way.\n\n\"Very disappointed in the performance,\" said Ryan ten Doeschate.\n\n\"When you set out to win a World Cup, don't expect someone to come and deliver it to you halfway through,\" the assistant coach added.\n\n\"We've messed up on a grand scale and now the onus is on this group of guys to turn it around and put in two solid performances.\"\n\nIndia are grouped with South Africa, the West Indies and Zimbabwe in Super Eights, with the top two advancing to the semi-finals.\n\nThe West Indies face Zimbabwe on Monday night in Mumbai in their Super Eights opener.\n\nIndia next face giant-killers Zimbabwe, who have already beaten Australia and Sri Lanka, on Thursday in Chennai.\n\nSouth Africa play the West Indies the same day in Ahmedabad where Aiden Markram's side could put one foot firmly in the semi-finals with another win.\n\n\"Obviously with the way the group goes, you need at least four points to get through now, and it's going to need two big performances and a big bounce back from everyone,\" said Ten Doeschate.\n\nIndia's fragile batting was exposed against an in-form bowling attack led by left-arm quick Marco Jansen, who returned figures of 4-22 from 3.5 overs. Keshav Maharaj took 3-24 with his left-arm spin.\n\nIndia's media tore into the team on Monday morning.\n\n\"The night the cloak came off,\" blazed a headline in the Indian Express newspaper.\n\n\"Sloppy India reach point of no return,\" said the Hindustan Times.\n\nIndia's ultra-aggressive left-handed opening pair have failed to fire, leaving a shaky middle order to pick up the pieces.\n\nIshan Kishan was out without scoring to Markram on Sunday, while the world's top- ranked T20 batter Abhishek Sharma fell to Jansen for 15, his only runs of the tournament so far after three ducks.\n\n\"It's certainly not panic stations,\" said Ten Doeschate, who hinted there could be discussions about India's batting line-up.\n\n\"If those guys (Ahbishek and Ishan) bat for six overs, the score is going to be 70-plus,\" said Ten Doeschate.\n\n\"So can we get them to temper the way they're playing and be a little bit smarter?\n\n\"Or do we just let them go on the way they are?\n\n\"Or do we bring in a right-hander at the top and make a change somewhere in the middle?\"\n\nCaptain Suryakumar Yadav agreed India need to use their brains in the first six-over power play when only two fielders are allowed on the boundary.\n\n\"Chasing 180-185, you can't win the game in the power play, but you might lose it,\" he said after his side stumbled to 31-3 after six overs, which became 43-4 a few balls later and then 51-5.\n\n\"We lost too many wickets in the power play.\"\n\nThe 2024 champions also have the weight of history against them. No team has ever retained the T20 World Cup and no side have ever won the trophy on home soil.",

We're pumped for the bowling crew, they've been working hard. The partnership [between Miller and Brevis] steadied the ship and kept us in the game. We looked at where we could run hard and our batting in the middle was the difference.\n\n\"We're going to have to enjoy this but park it and get our minds sharp [to face West Indies]. We don't want to take confidence and good vibes for granted.\"\n\nIndia captain Suryakumar Yadav: \"You can't win the game in the powerplay, but you can lose it. We lost too many wickets in the powerplay.\n\n\"Hopefully we bat well, bowl well and field well [against Zimbabwe]. I hope we play the same brand of cricket, nothing changes.\"\n\nTest Match Special commentator Prakash Wakankar: \"You see the satisfaction but also the steely determination on the faces of the South Africa players. Right from the toss, there wasn't the customary smile from Markram, who was very serious and focused.\n\n\"The disappointment from the captain after getting out really said a lot.

Closer ‌cooperation is expected to improve India's ⁠access to raw materials and technologies needed to sustain long-term growth in its steel sector, an Indian government statement said.\n\nThe cooperation will ⁠focus on attracting investment in exploration, mining and steel sector infrastructure, the statement said.\n\nIndia has steelmaking capacity of 218 million metric tons, and companies are expanding output to meet rising domestic ​demand ​driven by infrastructure development and industrialisation.\n\nAddressing a meeting ​with a Brazilian delegation led by ‌Lula, Modi said their talks had focused on ways to deepen the India-Brazil trade partnership.\n\n\"We are committed to taking bilateral trade much beyond $20 billion in the next five years,\" Modi said.\n\nBilateral trade between the two countries currently stands at about $15 billion.\n\n\"Our nations will also work closely in areas such as technology, innovation, digital public infrastructure, AI, semiconductors and more,\" ‌Modi said.\n\nLARGEST TRADING PARTNER IN LATIN AMERICA\n\nIndia and ​Brazil have been strategic partners since 2006, with cooperation ​spanning trade, defence, energy, agriculture, health, ​critical minerals, technology and digital infrastructure.\n\nBrazil is India's largest trading partner ‌in the Latin America and Caribbean region, ​and the two countries ​work closely on global issues such as U.N. reform, climate change and counter-terrorism.\n\nLula on Thursday advocated for Brazil and India to conduct trade in their own currencies ​rather than settling transactions in ‌U.S. dollars, but dismissed speculation that the BRICS group of countries, of ​which both nations are members, would create a common currency.",

    "fullText": "Investigators examining last year’s deadly Air India Flight 171 crash in Ahmedabad have concluded the disaster was caused by the pilot in command deliberately moving both engine fuel control switches to cutoff, according to a report published Thursday.\n\nThe Boeing 787 Dreamliner lost thrust seconds after takeoff and crashed into a medical student hostel on June 12, 2025, killing 241 people on board and 19 on the ground. The report cites cockpit voice and flight data recordings that allegedly show manual shutdown of both engines despite no evidence of mechanical failure.\n\nBlack box data under review: The aircraft’s cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered days after the crash and sent for detailed analysis as part of the investigation led by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau with technical assistance from U.S. and U.K. authorities. The Boeing 787 was powered by twin engines and equipped with electronically controlled fuel systems that require intentional manual input to change fuel flow settings. Investigators have examined parameters including throttle position, engine core speed and fuel flow rates to determine the sequence of events in the seconds between liftoff and impact.\n\nMental health scrutiny surfaces: The report also claims that Captain Sumeet Sabharwal had experienced depression in the months before the crash, citing unnamed sources familiar with the inquiry. Sabharwal’s family has publicly rejected assertions about his mental health and called for a fresh and impartial investigation. Pilot associations in India previously objected to earlier reports suggesting pilot responsibility, urging authorities to avoid attributing blame before the final report is issued.\n\nTrending on NextShark: AI research boom draws scrutiny after single author claims 113 papers in one year\n\nLegal questions emerge: The crash has prompted scrutiny beyond the technical investigation, including reports that Air India has offered financial settlements to some victims’ families. According to separate media accounts, the offers allegedly included provisions limiting the ability to pursue legal action against the airline and the aircraft manufacturer. Air India has not publicly detailed the terms of any such agreements, and the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau has yet to release its final determination of cause.\n\nThis story is part of The Rebel Yellow Newsletter — a bold weekly newsletter from the creators of NextShark, reclaiming our stories and celebrating Asian American voices.\n\nTrending on NextShark: Minority psychologist coalition challenges Jewish ethnic recognition within APA\n\nSubscribe free to join the movement.

    "description": "India opener Abhishek Sharma has struggled in the T20 World Cup with three ducks, but the team management continues to back him. Coach Morne Morkel said there is no talk of dropping him. Sunil Gavaskar feels pressure is affecting his game and advised him to build innings patiently. Assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate said Abhishek showed good form in the nets and should bounce back in the Super 8s.",
    "fullText": "Team India bowling coach Morne Morkel dismissed any talk of dropping him and said, \"Absolutely no discussion on Abhishek Sharma in the group. He is going to deliver, for the team and viewers. He is entertaining. He is hitting the ball well in the nets.\"\n\nFormer India captain Sunil Gavaskar feels pressure is affecting the 25-year-old batter. He believes Abhishek is trying too hard to hit big shots from the first ball instead of settling in. \n\n“Abhishek Sharma is a lovely guy, but expectations seem to be weighing on him. If he had started well against the USA, it would have been different. Now, the pressure of being the big six-hitter and top batter is showing,\" Gavaskar said.\n\n\"With his shot range, he needs to spend time in the middle. He cannot try to hit a boundary or six on the first ball of his innings. If the big shots come, fine. But he shouldn’t force himself to play the big shots across the line,” he added.\n\nHe also advised Abhishek to start slowly and build his innings. \n\n“Take a single and get off the mark. Even four dot balls don’t matter. He can make up for them later. He needs to play smart. Spend an hour or two settling in, then play his natural game. First, just get off the mark. Every batter wants that first run. Once he gets it, everything will fall into place,” he added.\n\nAssistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate also backed Abhishek and said he showed good form in training after recovering from illness. \n\nHe said Abhishek batted well in the nets and should be fine in the next phase.\n\nWith India reaching the Super 8s, the team hopes Abhishek will regain confidence and perform when it matters most.",

    "fullText": "Narendra Modi’s thirst to supercharge economic growth is matched by US desire to inject AI into world’s biggest democracy\n\nIndia celebrates 80 years of independence from the UK in August 2027. At about that same moment, “early versions of true super intelligence” could emerge, Sam Altman, the co-founder of OpenAI, said this week.\n\nIt’s a looming coincidence that raised a charged question at the AI Impact summit in Delhi, hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi: can India avoid returning to the status of a vassal state when it imports AI to raise the prospects of its 1.4 billion people?\n\nModi’s hunger to harness AI’s capability is great. He compared it on Thursday to a turning point that resets the direction of civilisation, such as “when the first sparks were struck from stone”. The most common analogy heard among the thousands of visitors to the summit was the dawn of electricity, but Modi was talking about fire.\n\nHis desire to use AI to supercharge Indian economic growth is matched by that of the big US tech companies. OpenAI, Google and Anthropic all played prominent roles at the summit, announcing deals to get ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude AIs into more people’s hands.\n\nThe Trump administration, seeing AI as central to its battle for supremacy with China, was clearing the path for the three AI companies. The US government signed the Pax Silica, a technology agreement that binds India closer to US tech and away from Beijing.\n\nAt the signing, Jacob Helberg, the US under secretary of state for economic affairs, emphasised the threat from China if India should even think about looking elsewhere for its AI. “We have seen the lights of a great Indian city extinguished by a keystroke,” he said, in an apparent reference to a suspected Chinese cyber-attack on Mumbai in 2020.\n\nIndia lacks the semiconductors, power plants and vast gigawatt datacentres to go it alone. In common with most other countries, it faces a choice between US and Chinese AI models. Which they choose could have profound consequences for who controls India’s future, because if AI’s power emerges as predicted, it will not only tweak economic and social structures, but become their new bedrock.\n\nStuart Russell, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of California, Berkeley, who closely follows India’s progress, said: “If we get to AGI [artificial general intelligence], AI is going to be producing 80% of the global economy. All manufacturing, most agriculture, all services will be just done; managed by AI, produced by AI.”\n\nImagine, he said, an Indian village priced out of having a health centre. In the future, AI could design the hospital and “along comes a bunch of giant quad copters carrying the materials, and a bunch of robots come and assemble everything. Two weeks later, you’ve got a hospital.”\n\nIn this scenario, technology becomes integral to a country’s wellbeing. Elements of sovereignty can be fought over, but how successful that will be remains to be seen. AI’s power is such that its controller gains enormous leverage.\n\nAnthropic’s chief executive, Dario Amodei, told the summit: “It may sound absurd, but AI can even help India achieve a standout 25% economic growth.” If that were to happen, it would take India to a per-capita GDP in a decade that is equivalent to Greece today. How could a leader resist?\n\nModi’s tech secretary, Shri Krishnan, said India realised it must ally with like-minded countries to ensure it did not become “enslaved”. It is a high-stakes decision.\n\nIndia appears unlikely to turn to China, for now. It has the AI models, but there are tensions on the Himalayan border, and Chinese companies and leaders were scarce at the summit.\n\nWill India thrive with US AI? Silicon Valley companies talk of cooperation not control. Chris Lehane, OpenAI’s head of global policy, said: “We don’t see India as a customer, we see it as a strategic partner.”\n\nUS officials framed the deal with India as an alliance of two nations that “broke centuries of colonial rule”, and as “two great democracies saying we will build together”.\n\nThe Guardian asked Michael Kratsios, Donald Trump’s science and technology adviser, if India risked being controlled by the US under a form of digital colonialism.\n\n“I would say it is actually the opposite,” he said. “Any country that builds on top of the American AI stack will have the most open, independently controlled, secured stack the world has to offer. And that is why we are soon keen to share it with so many countries that are prioritising their AI sovereignty.”\n\nRussell sees another possibility. “I think the American companies want to get in at that high-school and middle-school level to create basically a bunch of AI addicts who can’t tie their shoelaces without the help of AI,” he said. “Silicon Valley has always been about eyeballs. You monetise later and it works. Google and Facebook generate vast amounts of money.”\n\nCould India build its own AI? It is investing billions in datacentres and semiconductor capacity, but it takes years to come online.\n\nAltman was asked on Thursday how Indian entrepreneurs could build their own AI and his response was blunt. “Look, the way this works is we’re going to tell you it’s totally hopeless to compete with us on training foundation and you shouldn’t even try, and it’s your job to try anyway and I believe both of those things.”\n\nIndia can press US tech companies to adapt their AIs to its kaleidoscope of languages and cultures, and attempt to insist on guardrails. There is much at stake. As the summit came to a close, Joanna Shields, a former Facebook and Google executive and a UK minister for internet safety, warned: “If we have a world where we are accepting models from just the global north, we will lose so much of our cultural diversity, our uniqueness as people, wherever we come from … We don’t want to develop a monoculture based on a handful of models that everybody uses around the world and we lose that richness of who we are, what makes us human.”",

Ishan Kishan's explosive 77 powered India to 175/7, a target Pakistan couldn't chase, falling for 114. This win secured India's Super Eight spot unbeaten.",
    "fullText": "The scintillating performance by the Men in Blue also contributed to a 56% growth in reach over the India-Pakistan clash during the 2024 edition. Fans tuned in for a whopping 20 billion minutes of total watch time across all screens, reflecting immense engagement.\n\nOn the field, India made a ruthless statement, comfortably defeating Pakistan by 61 runs to secure a place in the Super Eight stage unbeaten. After electing to field first, Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha’s surprise move to bowl in the opening over produced an early wicket, dismissing Abhishek Sharma. But Ishan Kishan immediately turned the tide with a power-packed display, asserting dominance from the start. Pulling Shaheen Shah Afridi for a six on the first ball, Kishan continued to attack, supported by Tilak Varma as India racked up 52 for 1 after six overs, Kishan contributing 42 off just 25 balls.\n\nKishan’s blitz extended beyond the powerplay, hitting a 27-ball fifty and ending with a brilliant 77 off 40 balls, before being dismissed by Saim Ayub. Pakistan relied heavily on spin, using six spinners in the innings—the most ever by a team in a T20 World Cup and joint-most by a Full Member in a T20I. Saim Ayub impressed, removing Tilak Varma and Hardik Pandya and finishing with 3 wickets for 25 runs, nearly claiming a hat-trick. India closed their innings at 175 for 7, bolstered by contributions from Suryakumar Yadav (32), Shivam Dube (27), and Rinku Singh (11).\n\nPakistan’s chase never gained traction. Hardik Pandya dismissed Shahibzada Farhan for a duck, followed by Saim Ayub and Jasprit Bumrah dismantling the middle order. Even Salman Ali Agha and Babar Azam faltered under pressure, while Usman Khan’s 44 off 34 balls was the only bright spark. India’s bowlers, led by Jasprit Bumrah (2/17), Axar Patel (2/29), and Varun Chakravarthy (2/16), ensured Pakistan was bowled out for 114 in 17.5 overs, sealing a one-sided victory.\n\nBrief Scores:\nIndia: 175/7 (Ishan Kishan 77, Suryakumar Yadav 32, Shivam Dube 27; Saim Ayub 3/25)\nPakistan: 114 all out (Usman Khan 44; Jasprit Bumrah 2/17, Axar Patel 2/29, Varun Chakravarthy 2/16)",

    "title": "The biggest names in AI are gathering for a summit in India. Here are 5 of the biggest takeaways.",
    "description": "From Sam Altman to Demis Hassabis, AI leaders gathered in India to speak about the future of the technology.",
    "fullText": "AI's biggest power players showed up in India on Thursday.\n\nOpenAI's Sam Altman, Anthropic's Dario Amodei, Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis, Microsoft's Brad Smith, Scale AI's Alexandr Wang, and Mistral's Arthur Mensch spoke in succession at the AI Impact Summit held in New Delhi.\n\nFrom a potential \"AI divide\" to calls for stronger global coordination, here are five of the biggest takeaways from the summit so far.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said the world must not let the digital divide \"become an AI divide.\" He said expanding access to compute infrastructure, connectivity, and training is essential as AI reshapes economies.\n\nPichai said AI represents \"the biggest platform shift of our lifetimes\" and could drive \"hyper progress\" across science, healthcare, and economic development. But its benefits are neither \"guaranteed nor automatic.\"\n\n\"We must be equally bold in tackling problems in regions that have lacked access to technology,\" Pichai said. \"We cannot allow the digital divide to become an AI divide. That means investing in compute infrastructure and connectivity.\"\n\nGovernments must act both as regulators and innovators to ensure AI improves public services and broadens opportunity, he added.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that while AI capabilities are advancing rapidly, there's a gap between those capabilities and real-world impact.\n\n\"There is this duality between the fundamental capabilities of the technology and the time that it takes for those capabilities to diffuse into the world,\" he said.\n\n\"There are just frictions to adopt things through enterprises, and I think even more so in the developing world,\" he added.\n\nThe Google DeepMind CEO said India will be a \"powerhouse for AI\" across the world. He praised summits that bring together scientists, policymakers, and technologists, the latter of whom he said can't be left alone navigating AI.\n\nHassabis said we're in \"one of the most momentous\" times in human history and compared AI to the advent of fire and electricity.\n\n\"It's gonna be something like 10 times the impact of the Industrial Revolution, but happening at 10 times the speed, probably unfolding in a matter of a decade rather than a century,\" he said.\n\nGiven this level of impact, he said we need to use a scientific approach to understand AI's capabilities and build guardrails so that the technology \"serves the purposes that we want.\"\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said rapid advances in AI could require new global governance mechanisms, something akin to the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\n\"In particular, we expect the world may need something like the IAEA for international coordination of AI,\" Altman said, adding that such a body would need \"the ability to rapidly respond to change in circumstances.\"\n\nAltman said AI's trajectory could create risks that no single company or country can manage alone.\n\n\"We need a society-wide approach about how we're going to defend against this,\" he said, referring to the possibility of highly capable \"bio models\" becoming available.\n\nLong-term AI development is a responsibility to future generations, Altman also said, adding that it is a \"moral imperative\" to ensure future generations can benefit from and build upon technological progress.\n\nMeta's former chief scientist said we're still missing something \"big\" in AI.\n\n\"Why do we have systems that can pass the bar exam and win mathematics olympiads? But we don't have domestic robots. We don't even have self-driving cars,\" LeCun said. \"We certainly do not have several cars that can teach themselves to drive in 20 hours of practice like in 17-year-old.\"\n\nHe said that babies and animals have a much better understanding of the physical world around them than any AI systems today, which is why we don't have \"smart robots\" yet.\n\nHe said what is needed is world models — \"mental models of the world that allow us to think ahead, apprehend new situations, plan, sequence of actions, reason, and predict the consequences of our actions.\"\n\nIn November, LeCun announced his departure from Meta, where he had worked for 12 years, and said he would launch his own AI company. His new startup, AMI Labs, focuses on building world models.\n\nMicrosoft president Brad Smith said we need to make AI effective for the Global South, and that needs conscious planning.\n\n\"We need to make AI as effective in every language as it is in English, and today, it is not,\" he said. \"Performance tests show that's the case.\"\n\n\"One of the good things to come out of this week is new announcements to better data in other languages, to provide better tools and measurement systems for AI that is built in other languages,\" he added.\n\nThe other thing that needs to be done is to work on problems that matter to the Global South. That means focusing on improvements in agriculture for India, and addressing food security in Africa.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Bill Gates pulled out of India's AI Impact Summit hours before his scheduled keynote address on Thursday, dealing another blow to a flagship event already marred by organisational ‌lapses, a robot row and delegate complaints over traffic disruptions.\n\nGates' absence, followed by another high-profile cancellation by Nvidia's Jensen Huang, ‌adds to a difficult opening for a summit billed as the first major artificial intelligence forum in the Global South, where India has sought to position itself ​as a leading voice in worldwide AI governance.\n\nThe Gates Foundation said the billionaire will not deliver his address \"to ensure the focus remains on the AI Summit's key priorities\". Only days ago, the foundation had dismissed rumours of his absence and insisted he was on track to attend.\n\nGates' cancellation comes after the U.S. Department of Justice released emails last month that included communication between late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and ‌the Gates Foundation's staff.\n\nGates has said the relationship ⁠was confined to philanthropy-related discussions and that it was a mistake for him to meet Epstein.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi called for children's safety on AI platforms as he addressed the gathering on Thursday, alongside French ⁠President Emmanuel Macron, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei.\n\n\"We must be even more vigilant about children’s safety. Just as a school syllabus is curated, the AI space should also be child- and family-guided,\" Modi said, after standing on stage with top AI executives ​and ​posing for photographs with their arms raised in a show of strength.\n\nHowever, ​India's first major AI summit has been marred by ‌management lapses that have left attendees shocked and angry over what they described as a lack of planning by the Indian government.\n\nThe summit exhibition halls were shut to the public on Thursday in a surprise move that led to more anger among participating companies that had put up stalls and pavilions.\n\nThe venue compound was largely deserted after three days of large crowds at the event.\n\nOn Wednesday, Indian university Galgotias was asked to vacate its stall after a staff member presented a commercially available robotic dog made in China ‌as its own creation, sparking a public uproar.\n\nPolice shut roads to give preference ​to VIP movement at the summit, creating chaos in the city of 20 million ​people.\n\nOn Wednesday, footage on social media showed scores of ​attendees at the summit walking for miles in central Delhi as roads were shut for traffic, with no ‌availability of taxis and no shuttle services arranged.\n\nReposting one such ​video, opposition leader Mahua Moitra wrote ​on X that the poor management had besmirched India’s reputation globally.\n\nStill, there has been more than $100 billion of investment in India AI projects pledged during the summit, including from the Adani Group conglomerate, tech giant Microsoft, and data centre firm Yotta.\n\nThe Indian ​government has said it expects total pledges ‌to exceed $200 billion in the next two years, although analysts have warned the rapid build-out risks straining India's power grid ​and water supply.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 18 (Reuters) - An Indian university has been asked to vacate its stall at the country's flagship AI summit after a ‌staff member was caught presenting a commercially available robotic dog made in China ‌as its own creation, two government sources said.\n\n\"You need to meet Orion. This has been developed by the Centre ​of Excellence at Galgotias University,\" Neha Singh, a professor of communications, told state-run broadcaster DD News this week in remarks that have since gone viral.\n\nBut social media users quickly identified the robot as the Unitree Go2, sold by China's Unitree Robotics for about $2,800 and widely used ‌in research and education globally.\n\nThe episode ⁠has drawn sharp criticism and has cast an uncomfortable spotlight on India's artificial intelligence ambitions.\n\nThe embarrassment was amplified by IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, ⁠who shared the video clip on his official social media account before the backlash. The post was later deleted.\n\nBoth Galgotias and Singh have subsequently said the robot was not a university creation ​and ​the university had never claimed otherwise.\n\nThe stall remained ​open to visitors as of Wednesday ‌morning with university officials fielding questions from media about accusations of plagiarism and misrepresentation.\n\nGalgotias has yet to receive any communication about being kicked out from the event, a representative at the booth said.\n\nThe India AI Impact summit at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi, which runs until Saturday, has been billed as the first major AI gathering hosted in the Global ‌South.

    "fullText": "Google, Anthropic and OpenAI bosses to mingle with global south leaders wrestling for control over technology\n\nSilicon Valley tech billionaires will land in Delhi this week for an AI summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, where leaders of the global south will wrestle for control over the fast-developing technology.\n\nDuring the week-long AI Impact Summit, attended by thousands of tech executives, government officials and AI safety experts, tech companies valued at trillions of dollars will rub along with leaders of countries such as Kenya and Indonesia, where average wages dip well below $1,000 a month.\n\nAmid a push to speed up AI adoption across the globe, Sundar Pichai, Sam Altman and Dario Amodei, the heads of Google, OpenAI and Anthropic, will all be there. Rishi Sunak and George Osborne, a former British prime minister and a former chancellor, will each be pushing for greater adoption of AI. Sunak has taken jobs for Microsoft and Anthropic and Osborne leads OpenAI’s push to deepen and widen the use of ChatGPT beyond its existing 800 million users.\n\nMeanwhile Modi, who will address the summit on Thursday, is positioning India as the AI hub for south Asia and Africa. On the agenda will be AI’s potential to transform agriculture, water supplies and public health. Governments in Kenya, Senegal, Mauritius, Togo, Indonesia and Egypt will send ministers.\n\nModi’s enthusiasm for AI has a darker side, civil liberties campaigners say. Last week they raised serious concerns about India deploying AI to increase state surveillance, discriminate against minorities and sway elections. But Modi this week spoke of “harnessing artificial intelligence for human-centric progress” and India has given the summit the strapline: “Welfare for all, happiness for all.”\n\nSummit observers talk of a battle between a new kind of AI colonialism from the US tech firms and an alternative “techno-Gandhism”, in which AI is used for social justice and to benefit marginalised people. After global AI summits in the UK, Korea and France, the Delhi meeting is the first to be held in the global south.\n\nIndian commentators say the test of AI’s value is not in its technical sophistication but whether it can improve the lives of people living in some of the toughest circumstances in the global south. By contrast, US AI companies are racing for supremacy, competing with each other and China, and rolling out AI for shopping, personal companionship and agentic systems that could slash corporate labour costs by making white-collar jobs redundant.\n\nIf a referee between the two sides is needed, António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations, will speak in Delhi. This week he said it would be “totally unacceptable that AI would be just a privilege of the most developed countries or a division only between two superpowers”.\n\nIndia’s AI Impact Summit is the fourth iteration of the event, which Sunak launched in 2023 at Bletchley Park in the UK, with a focus on international coordination to prevent catastrophic risks from the most advanced AI models. Summits followed in Seoul in 2024 and Paris in 2025, where the US vice-president, JD Vance, appeared to abandon the White House’s interest in safety saying: “The AI future will not be won by hand-wringing about safety; it will be won by building.”\n\nSafety is once again on the agenda, with Yoshua Bengio, one of the “godfathers” of AI, on hand to repeat his fears about the risk of powerful AI systems enabling cyber- and bioweapons attacks.\n\n“The capabilities of AI have continued to advance, and although mitigation and risk management of AI has also progressed [it has happened] not as quickly,” he said on Tuesday. “So it becomes urgent that leaders of this world understand where we could be going and it needs their attention and intervention as soon as possible.”\n\nOne of those working at the summit to make sure AI remains safe will be Nicolas Miaihle, co-founder of the AI Safety Connect group, who noted that the summit was taking place in the shadow of AI-enabled warfare in Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\n“The existential risks are not going anywhere,” he told the Guardian. “When Rishi Sunak started this, the race was not raging as hard. The trillions are pouring in but we are very far away from securing these models. This is profound for democracy, profound for the mental health of our kids and profound for warfare.”\n\nBut the Trump administration continues its policy of refusing to bind US AI companies with red tape. The White House is not expected to send a high-level representative to Delhi, with Sriram Krishnan, its senior AI policy adviser, the highest-ranked speaker listed in the programme.\n\n“Given where we are with the US administration it’s pretty unlikely you’re going to have a massive breakthrough on any consensus on what a regulatory framework will look like,” said one senior AI company source.\n\nCompanies such as Google are focused on the use of AI in education in India, where large language models’ ability to function in many of the country’s dozens of languages is an advantage.\n\n“[There’s] a big focus on access and adoption, how can you make sure that the technology is available as broadly as possible,” said Owen Larter, head of frontier AI policy and public affairs at Google DeepMind. “We’re excited on the education front in India. It’s a remarkable story of an incredibly intense adoption. About 90% of teachers and students already using AI in their learning. We’ve had a big promotional programme where 2 million students have access to our pro subscription for free.”\n\nGoogle’s investments in India include a $15bn spend, in partnership with the conglomerate of Gautam Adani, one of India’s richest billionaires, on an gigawatt-scale AI datacentre hub in the coastal city of Visakhapatnam, in Andhra Pradesh, with subsea cables connecting to other parts of the world.",

Washington earlier this month announced it will cut import tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50%, as New Delhi has agreed ‌to stop Russian oil imports.\n\nSanctioned ⁠vessels Stellar Ruby, Asphalt Star, and Al Jafzia frequently changed their identities to evade law enforcement by coastal states, the source ⁠said, adding that their owners were based overseas.\n\nIndian authorities said in a post on X on February 6 that they had intercepted three vessels about 100 nautical miles west ​of Mumbai ​after detecting suspicious activity involving a tanker ​in India's exclusive economic zone. ‌The post was later deleted, but the source now confirmed that the vessels had been escorted to Mumbai for further investigation.\n\nThe Indian Coast Guard has since deployed about 55 ships and 10 to 12 aircraft for round-the-clock surveillance in its maritime zones, according to the source.\n\nThe U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control last year ‌sanctioned the vessels Global Peace, Chil 1, and ​Glory Star 1 with IMO numbers identical to ​the ships captured by India.\n\nTwo ​of the three tankers are linked to Iran, with Al ‌Jafzia having carried fuel oil from Iran ​to Djibouti in ​2025 and Stellar Ruby flagged in Iran, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe Asphalt Star mostly operated on voyages around China, the data show.\n\nSanctioned oil and fuel ​are often sold at ‌deep discounts due to the risks involved, with intermediaries moving cargo through ​complex ownership structures, false documentation and mid-sea transfers that complicate enforcement.\n\n(Reporting ​by Saurabh Sharma; editing by Andrei Khalip)",

    "description": "After weeks of debate about whether Pakistan's fixture against India would go ahead at the T20 World Cup, the action failed to deliver and it left the rivalry feeling more political than sporting.",
    "fullText": "Colombo awoke to its greyest sky of the week come Sunday morning. A portent, perhaps, of the weather forecast which briefly caused a scare prior to India's dominant win over Pakistan later that evening.\n\nIt certainly mirrored the cloud lurking over the build-up to cricket's most-charged derby. Pakistan relented on their original decision to boycott the fixture in solidarity with Bangladesh, who had to forfeit their place in this T20 World Cup when refused dispensation to play their games outside of India.\n\nArguably more interest stemmed from the pageantry of Sunday's game than from the actual cricket. Plenty were on handshake-watch given recent history between these two. Polite formalities did not return at the toss, Suryakumar Yadav and Salman Ali Agha giving each other the silent treatment.\n\nTo be ready for the myriad cameras capturing the flip of the coin, both captains have to be in place a good two minutes before getting on with the ceremony. When mired in such awkwardness, it seems an eternity.\n\nEnough time for a detail-oriented TV producer to spot that Salman, Pakistan's skipper, sported a kink in his collar. The scruffy schoolboy-look was rectified by an anonymous figure inadvertently stealing the situation's authority. It certainly detracted from the attempted strong-man image projected by stubborn leaders.\n\nAs did the behaviour of the ex-pros off the pitch. On the ICC broadcast, Rohit Sharma and Wasim Akram warmly greeted before walking the tournament trophy onto the field. Away from the cameras, Harbhajan Singh, Misbah Ul-Haq and Ramiz Raja were spotted in cordial conversation in the media area.\n\nThe stadium certainly felt different to earlier World Cup matches at this venue. A perimeter was set multiple blocks from the ground. Bags were inspected long before the entrance. And again upon arrival. The Sri Lankan special task force, previously unseen at this tournament, was out in force, automatic weapons on full display.\n\nEven the price of a fake jersey among street vendors shot up amid India-Pakistan inflation. Local entrepreneurs were delighted the fixture went ahead. As were the swarming hotels. Such was the influx in India's accommodation that Mohammed Siraj could not squeeze into the lift on his morning commute.\n\nThe backdrop reflected the magnitude of the occasion, but not necessarily any tension. That didn't come until the toss. Albeit there were some murmurs of discontent at the choice of pre-match music. Indian rapper Hanumankind performed with his dance troupe and pyrotechnics aplenty.\n\nHe appeared on the soundtrack to Dhurandhar, a movie released last year, the political undertones of which were not well received in Pakistan where the film is banned. Shortly after Sunday's performance concluded, the call to prayer could be heard from a local mosque. The cricketing gods have a sense of humour.\n\nBoth camps were reluctant to really delve into the off-field narratives. \"In these games the emotions are always going to be high but we need to deal with that,\" said Salman.\n\n\"We have played enough cricket and games like this. You have to see the bigger picture and win our next game to qualify for the Super 8s.\"\n\nKishan goes crazy as India hammer Pakistan\n\nOnce the cricket finally started, Ishan Kishan's belligerent hitting delighted the Indian-heavy crowd - which, it should be said, was not at capacity. Usman Tariq's curious action, his pause akin to Jorginho's jump when taking a penalty, dominated pre-match chat. He failed to remain the protagonist of the contest itself, albeit he did cheekily bow towards Suryakumar upon dismissing the man who was filmed mimicking his ways during Indian net sessions.\n\nAt the mid-innings break, some dared to think we could have a chase on our hands with Pakistan needing 176. India's dominant powerplay, taking four wickets and conceding just 39 runs, put a swift end to such notions.\n\nThe scoreline in this match-up at T20 World Cups now reads 8-1 in favour of India. This rivalry has become political, rather than a sporting one. As tedious as the interference is, it offers more to discuss than one side consistently outclassing the other.\n\nAs if aware of this, in a lull during Pakistan's inevitable defeat, the ICC replayed the cordial exchange between Wasim and Rohit prior to the match. Aren't we all getting along just fine? Just not to the extent that players shook hands once India wrapped up their shellacking. That sign of respect continues to feel some way off.\n\n\"We see them as a team - we are not thinking about this as a rivalry or whatever,\" said India's Axar Patel.\n\n\"We are playing against one team and we are focusing on cricket. Whenever I'm playing, I'm not thinking about whatever, I treat it as one match and opponent.\"\n\nAfter the final wicket, Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube did not feel they had hit their desired workloads. The former bowled three overs in the match, the latter was not required. Out came bowling coach Morne Morkel to catch extra work with his baseball mitt. Opposition resoundingly dealt with yet more reps needed.\n\nAn apt reflection, not that it was required, of this contest's non-existent relationship with the sort of jeopardy required to make us all forget the politics.\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup Super 8s?\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nWhy is there talk about a Pakistan spinner's action?",

    "fullText": "The T20 World Cup heads into the final week of group-stage fixtures with six spots in the Super 8s still up for grabs.\n\nWest Indies were the first team to qualify for the next phase, while India joined them with victory over Pakistan later on Sunday.\n\nHere's what the remaining teams need to progress to the next stage.\n\nThe top two teams in each group - A to D - will progress to the Super 8s, which will be made up of two groups of four.\n\nIf any teams are level on points after the four group-stage fixtures, they will be separated by number of wins and then net run-rate.\n\nThe International Cricket Council has pre-determined the Super 8 groups if the eight seeded sides qualify:\n\nX Group: India (X1), Australia (X2), West Indies (X3), South Africa (X4)\n\nY Group: England (Y1), New Zealand (Y2), Pakistan (Y3), Sri Lanka (Y4)\n\nIf any of those sides do not progress, the teams who do in their place will just fill the spot.\n\nEach team plays three more matches in the Super 8s phase, facing each of the other teams in their group once.\n\nAfter those fixtures, the top two teams from each group will advance to the semi-finals, with the winner of each Super 8s group facing the runner-up from the other.\n\nRemaining games: Pakistan v Namibia (18 Feb, 09:30) and India v Netherlands (18 Feb, 13:30)\n\nDefending champions India sealed their place in the Super 8s with a comfortable 61-run win over rivals Pakistan.\n\nPakistan slipped to third with that defeat, with their net run-rate taking a heavy hit.\n\nHowever, a win in their final game against Namibia on Wednesday would see them progress.\n\nUSA have played all of their games and are currently second but need Pakistan to lose their final game and for the Netherlands to lose or not overtake their net run-rate if they win.\n\nThe Netherlands must beat India, hope Pakistan lose and then it could come down to net run-rate.\n\nRemaining games: Australia v Sri Lanka (16 Feb, 13:30), Ireland v Zimbabwe (17 Feb 09:30 GMT), Sri Lanka v Zimbabwe (19 Feb, 09:30), Australia v Oman (20 Feb, 13:30)\n\nSri Lanka will progress with a win over Australia on Monday. If they lose they would likely need to beat Zimbabwe and then it could come down to net run-rate. Two wins would guarantee progression.\n\nAustralia would be eliminated if they lose to Sri Lanka on Monday and Zimbabwe beat Ireland on Tuesday. They may need to win both their remaining games and rely on net run-rate.\n\nZimbabwe will guarantee progression with two wins. One win potentially may be enough but it would come down to net run-rate.\n\nIreland need to win their last match and hope other results go their way because they can only qualify on net run-rate.\n\nRemaining games: England v Italy (16 Feb, 09:30), Scotland v Nepal (17 Feb, 13:30), West Indies v Italy (19 Feb, 05:30)\n\nWest Indies secured their progression with a nine-wicket win over Nepal on Sunday.\n\nEngland must beat Italy on Monday to progress. A defeat would likely see them eliminated on net run-rate.\n\nScotland need to beat Nepal and hope Italy beat England but do not overtake their net run-rate.\n\nItaly must beat England but could lose to West Indies and then net run-rate would decide who progresses. Two wins would see them through, as would a win against England and a washed-out game against West Indies.\n\nRemaining games: Afghanistan v UAE (16 Feb, 05:30 GMT), New Zealand v Canada (17 Feb, 05:30 GMT), South Africa v UAE (18 Feb, 05:30 GMT), Afghanistan v Canada (19 Feb, 13:30 GMT)\n\nSouth Africa are in a strong position to progress and their spot could be sealed on Monday if UAE lose to Afghanistan. Regardless of that result, a win against UAE on Wednesday would confirm their progression.\n\nNew Zealand likely need to win and hope that UAE do not win both of their games. If both of those things happen then net run-rate would decide who moves through.\n\nUAE likely need to win both of their remaining games and even then are likely to be relying on net run-rate to progress.\n\nAfghanistan need to win both of their matches, including one against UAE, and hope that neither UAE or New Zealand pick up points in their final game.\n\nCanada need to win both their remaining fixtures and will need other results to go their way.\n\nRun-rate is the average number of runs scored per over by a team in their entire innings - so, for example, a score of 140 off 20 overs equals seven runs per over.\n\nNet run-rate is calculated by subtracting the opposition's run-rate from the other team's run-rate.\n\nThe winning side will therefore have a positive net run-rate, and the losers a negative net run-rate.\n\nIn a tournament, net run-rate is worked out by taking the average runs per over scored by that team in each game and subtracting the average runs per over scored against them in each game.\n\nIf a team is bowled out inside their allotted overs, their run-rate is calculated by dividing the runs by the maximum overs they could have batted - 20 overs in the case of this tournament.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "T20 World Cup, Group A, Colombo\n\nIndia 175-7 (20 overs): Kishan 77 (40); Ayub 3-25\n\nPakistan 114 (18 overs): Usman 44 (34); Hardik 2-16, Chakravarthy 2-17, Bumrah 2-17\n\nIndia continued their recent on-field dominance over Pakistan by winning their highly anticipated meeting in Colombo by 61 runs to confirm their place in the Super 8s of the T20 World Cup.\n\nAfter weeks of discussion and doubt over whether the match would even go ahead, India ultimately proved too strong and sealed a ninth successive win in completed matches against their rivals.\n\nAlthough the captains did not shake hands at the toss and there were no exchanges between the players after the final play, the rest of the match passed without any flashpoints amid the ongoing political tensions between the two nations and last year's military conflict.\n\nThe encounter was effectively won by a brutal early assault by India opener Ishan Kishan, who struck 77 from 40 balls on a tricky, turning pitch.\n\nIt gave co-hosts a flying start and meant, even with Pakistan's plethora of spinners slowing the scoring and taking wickets, they still posted 175-7.\n\nThat always felt a challenging total and Hardik Pandya took a wicket in the first over of the chase and Jasprit Bumrah two in the second to all but confirm the result.\n\nUsman Khan struck some blows in making 44 but Pakistan were swept aside - all out for 114 in 18 overs.\n\nWhile India are now certain to progress as they attempt to retain the title won in 2024, Pakistan must beat Namibia on Wednesday to guarantee their place in the Super 8s.\n\nShould they do so, the rivals could yet meet again in this competition in a semi-final or final.\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup Super 8s?\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nIndia-Pakistan to go ahead as government ends boycott request\n\nFor a while it looked like this match would not happen.\n\nPakistan, whose last win against India was at the Asia Cup in 2022, announced a boycott a week before the tournament began, only to reverse their decision at the start of this week after extensive talks.\n\nIt went ahead, in front of a large crowd weighted towards Indian blue, because it is the most lucrative fixture in the world game, providing the funds upon which cricket's ecosystem survives in its current imperfect state.\n\nHow long that remains the case given India's dominance, built from their cricketing and financial might, remains to be seen.\n\nKishan's assault gave India breathing space and their bowlers were ruthless, even if their fielders dropped three catches.\n\nAfter Pakistan's seamers went the distance, Hardik began with a wicket maiden - dismissing right-hander Sahibzada Farhan, who skewed a pull shot high to mid-on.\n\nIn the next over, the majestic Bumrah pinned left-hander Saim Ayub in front with full inswinger, before Pakistan Salman Agha holed out playing a wild slog.\n\nEven Pakistan's biggest name, Babar Azam, was tamely bowled for five attempting a swipe to left-arm spinner Axar Patel in the fifth over, while left-handers Mohammed Nawaz and Faheem Ashraf meekly picked out fielders in the deep.\n\nAfter all of the build-up this was another underwhelming meeting.\n\nKishan's innings was an outlier across the match. He scored at a strike-rate of 192.50 per 100 balls. Only one other batter to face more than five deliveries, Shivam Dube - who made 27 from 17 balls - went at more than 130.\n\nOf the first 88 runs in the match, 77 came off the bat of Kishan as he made his second 50 in a row at this World Cup.\n\nHe was fortunate to chip three swings into gaps but otherwise hit cleanly in all directions until he was bowled by Ayub in the ninth over.\n\nSwitching through six different spinners, Pakistan's fightback came too late with mystery spinner Usman Tariq held back too long.\n\nAyub had Tilak Verma lbw for a stodgy 25 from 24 balls before Hardik hit his next ball to long-off. Had Ayub's hat-trick ball not narrowly missed Dube's edge and stumps after turning sharply, Pakistan may have had a better chance.\n\nTheir decision to bowl first also seemed a misstep, with the ball skidding through later on.\n\nDube was left to push India beyond 150 which was probably a par total in the conditions.\n\nIn truth, little went right for Pakistan.",

Sunday’s game will be the first time the teams have met since last year’s acrimonious Asia Cup tournament in the United Arab Emirates which was won by India and where players refused to shake hands.  Elsewhere, West Indies aim for its third successive win in Group C as it won the toss and elected to field against Nepal in Mumbai.",

    "description": "Sri Lanka braced itself for massive losses after Pakistan’s boycott calls, but now awaits a thrilling clash on Sunday.",
    "fullText": "Colombo, Sri Lanka — Almost 30 years ago today, India and Pakistan formed a combined cricket team to take on Sri Lanka ahead of the 1996 Cricket World Cup in an unprecedented moment of unity in the sport’s history.\n\nThe two age-old rivals put aside their differences and came together in an act of solidarity to support a fellow South Asian team, who faced the threat of match boycotts in a tournament they had battled hard to host.\n\nIndia versus Pakistan is the most highly marketed fixture at every multination tournament – the World Cup, Asia Cup or Asian Games – whether it’s a men’s, women’s or Under-19 event.\n\nFew sporting events globally carry the weight and anticipation of an India-Pakistan cricket match. So, when Pakistan’s government ordered its team not to face India at the ongoing T20 World Cup, the tournament was briefly pushed into a state of chaos.\n\nIt also left Sri Lanka, the designated host of the fixture, holding its collective breath.\n\nA week of negotiations led to a dramatic late U-turn by the Pakistani government and the match will now take place as scheduled on Sunday at the R Premadasa International Cricket Stadium in Colombo.\n\nBut what if the boycott had gone ahead? The impact could have been catastrophic, not just for Pakistan, but also for the International Cricket Council (ICC), as well as Sri Lanka.\n\nWith the crisis seemingly averted, the island nation stands poised to reap the benefits in its financial landscape, diplomatic standing and community.\n\nFor a country that is still grappling with the aftermath of the economic crisis of 2022, an India-Pakistan cricket fixture at a World Cup could prove to be a godsend.\n\nThe tourism and hospitality industry was one of the hardest hit during Sri Lanka’s financial meltdown and this match will see an enormous influx of fans from India and Pakistan coming into the country.\n\nHotels in and around Colombo were fully booked out well ahead of the tournament but the industry braced itself for heavy losses after Pakistan threatened a boycott.\n\n“There’s been a massive impact since the boycott was announced,” Sudarshana Pieris, who works in Sri Lanka’s hospitality sector, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“All major hotels in Colombo were fully booked by Indian travel agencies well ahead [of the match] and once the boycott was announced, we lost almost all of those bookings,” he said.\n\n“But after Pakistan reversed their decision, hotel room rates shot up by about 300-400 percent at five-star establishments in Colombo.”\n\nIt’s not just hotels but several other local businesses – from street vendors to high-end restaurants – who are hoping for an increased footfall and spending over the weekend.\n\nThese short trips and the experiences they offer could influence visitors to extend their stay or return to Sri Lanka on holiday, long after the game has ended, in a potential long-term benefit to the industry.\n\nAnother relatively underestimated impact of the game would be the employment opportunities it creates, albeit temporarily, in the media, event management, security and transportation industries.\n\nAsanka Hadirampela, a freelance journalist and broadcaster currently working as a Sinhala language commentator for the World Cup, recognises the marquee match as a great opportunity from a personal standpoint.\n\n“This is my first World Cup as a broadcaster,” Hadirampela said.\n\n“The India-Pakistan fixture is the biggest and most-watched game of the tournament. So to get to work on such a match is exciting and I consider it a special achievement.”\n\nThe lines are always blurred between sport and politics in South Asia.\n\nSo while the financial gains are expected to be significant, the fixture’s impact on the region’s geopolitical environment cannot go amiss.\n\nPakistan’s boycott, too, was explicitly political, as confirmed by the country’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif when he said that they were offering support to Bangladesh after the Tigers were kicked out of the tournament by the ICC.\n\nThe reversal of Pakistan’s decision, which they said came after requests to reconsider the boycott by several regional “friends”, was steeped in politics, too.\n\nSri Lanka’s President Anura Kumara Dissanayake reportedly had a phone conversation with PM Sharif, urging his government to rethink their decision to boycott the game as the successful staging of this encounter would not only position Sri Lanka as a capable host of global sporting events but also reinforce its standing as a neutral mediator in a region fraught with geopolitical complexities.\n\nSri Lanka and Pakistan have always maintained strong diplomatic relations, which have extended to the cricket field as well.\n\nSri Lanka were one of the first teams to travel to Pakistan following their 10-year ostracisation from international cricket, which came as a result of a terrorist attack targeting the Sri Lankan team in March 2009.\n\nWhen Al Jazeera reached out to Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), its vice president Ravin Wickramaratne confirmed that SLC did, indeed, reach out to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) after the boycott was announced.\n\n“We asked them to reconsider the decision,” Wickramaratne said.\n\n“It [boycott] would have impacted Sri Lanka economically, whether directly or indirectly.\n\n“We have always had a good relationship with the PCB and we have always supported them, so we’re happy with their decision.”\n\nA little over 24 hours ahead of the match in Colombo, there is a sense of palpable excitement and a growing buzz around the fixture as it returns from the brink of cancellation.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, 28,000 tickets had been sold for the game but local organisers expect a capacity crowd of 40,000 to make it into the stands.\n\nCome Sunday, thousands more will line the streets in and around Maligawatte, the bustling Colombo suburb that houses the famous Premadasa Stadium.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI (AP) — A coalition of major trade unions and farmers’ groups in India mounted a nationwide strike Thursday to protest an interim trade deal with the United States, saying the agreement undermines the interests of farmers, small businesses and workers.\n\nIn parliament, lawmakers from opposition political parties demanded that the government scrap the trade deal and criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the slogan “Narendra Modi, surrender Modi.”\n\nThe one-day strike partially disrupted public services and manufacturing activities, highlighting resistance to the reform agenda set by Modi, leader of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party, and underscoring the political risks of pushing market-oriented policies before key state elections later this year.\n\nIn New Delhi, a protesting farmer activist, Hannan Mollah, said that India's recent free trade agreements with New Zealand, Europe and now the U.S. were poised to ruin India's farm sector as the local markets would be inundated by cheaper products.\n\n“The fight will go on till our demands are met,\" Mollah said \"If not, the public will gather in large numbers and uproot the Modi government.\"\n\nA union leader said that the trade deal with Washington opens the Indian market to subsidized agricultural products, threatening the livelihoods of millions of small farmers.\n\n“Cheap American farm produce will be dumped in India, making it difficult for our farmers and small businesses to compete,” said Amarjeet Kaur, general-secretary of All India Trade Union Congress, a prominent union that took part in the strike.\n\nThe government in New Delhi has defended the interim trade pact as a step toward expanding exports, attracting investments and strengthening strategic ties with the U.S. The interests of farmers in the agriculture and dairy sectors were protected, Indian Trade Minister Piyush Goyal said recently.\n\nIndia and the U.S. announced this month that they were moving closer to a formal trade pact, releasing an interim framework that would lower tariffs and deepen economic ties.\n\nA fact sheet issued by the White House shows reciprocal tariff on Indian goods decreasing from 25% to 18%, while an additional 25% penalty tariff for India's purchase of Russian oil will be dropped.\n\nIn return, India will stop buying Russian oil and purchase $500 billion worth of U.S. goods, including energy, while cutting taxes and non-tariff barriers.\n\nThe protesters in India also opposed Modi’s efforts to privatize state-run companies and implement new labor codes, calling the sweeping changes “deceptive fraud” against workers.\n\nIndian officials have argued that labor reforms were needed to boost efficiency and create jobs in the long run.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 12 (Reuters) - India on Thursday gave initial clearance for a 3.6-trillion-rupee ($40 billion) boost to the country's armed forces, including procurement of more Rafale fighter ‌jets for the air force and Boeing P-8I reconnaissance aircraft for the navy.\n\nHeightened ‌tensions with its neighbours, including Pakistan, have pushed India's military to modernise.\n\nThe air force's fighter squadron strength has shrunk ​to 29 in recent months, well below the 42 it had earlier. Its workhorse MiG-21 was retired in September and other early variants of the MiG-29, the Anglo-French Jaguar and the French Mirage 2000, are also set to end service in the coming years.\n\nNew Delhi has long relied on ‌importing machinery and weapons for its ⁠armed forces, but a recent push by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has helped boost domestic manufacturing.\n\nFor the Indian Air Force, this era began in ⁠the 1980s but was fruitful only in the last decade when the locally produced Tejas fighter jet was introduced to replace Soviet-era MiG-21s.\n\nHindustan Aeronautics (HAL) has nearly 180 of the advanced Mk-1A variants of the ​Tejas ​on order domestically, but has yet to begin deliveries ​due to engine supply chain issues ‌at GE Aerospace.\n\nThe defence ministry said the Defence Acquisition Council had given the initial nod for more Rafale fighter jets and missiles for the air force, anti-tank missiles for the army and P-8I reconnaissance aircraft for its navy.\n\nThe total value of all these proposals stands at 3.6 trillion rupees, the statement said. It did not elaborate further.\n\nThe approvals come ahead of a visit ‌by French President Emmanuel Macron to India next week. ​The Indian Air Force's fleet currently includes Rafale fighters ​from Dassault Aviation.\n\nIn April, India signed ​a deal for 26 Rafale-Marine twin- and single-seat jets to be deployed on ‌its two carriers: INS Vikrant and INS ​Vikramaditya.\n\nSeparately, the defence ministry ​on Thursday also signed a deal with HAL to buy eight Dornier 228 aircraft for the coastguard.\n\nThe proposals pave the way for commercial and technical details to be ​finalized soon.\n\nEarlier in the day, ‌local media reported that the DAC had given its approval to buy 114 Rafale ​fighter jets from Dassault for 3.25 trillion rupees.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 11 (Reuters) - India's stated intention to buy $500 billion of U.S. goods over five years under a trade deal is drawing scepticism, with ‌economists warning it could distort commercial procurement and sharply reshape New Delhi's trade balance.\n\nU.S. President Donald ‌Trump last week said he will slash tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50%, sparking relief in India. But he ​asked New Delhi to more than double its annual imports of U.S. goods in return.\n\nBilateral trade was $132 billion in 2024-25, with a roughly $41 billion surplus in India's favour.\n\nTrade experts and economists questioned whether $100 billion a year in imports was feasible without an explicit policy push that steers companies towards American suppliers.\n\n\"The math doesn't add up,\" ‌said Madhavi Arora, an economist at ⁠Emkay Global, calling the target more \"aspirational than realistic\".\n\nA joint statement issued by the two nations said India intends to buy $500 billion of U.S. goods - language that stops ⁠short of a binding commitment.\n\nBut Trump has shown little patience with countries that fall short, including a late-January move to raise tariffs on some South Korean goods back to 25% from 15% after saying Seoul failed to legislate ​an ​earlier deal.\n\nIndia aims to step up procurement of oil, ​gas, coking coal and aircraft from the U.S., ‌both nations said in the joint statement.\n\nArora cautioned such targets can imply a government nudge to private airline and corporate sourcing decisions, which may be inefficient.\n\nWhile India has cited large Boeing orders as part of the plan, some analysts say firms could still favour Airbus if commercial terms are better.\n\nIndian markets steadied after staging an initial relief rally, but economists said investors appear wary of the $500 billion headline.\n\n\"The markets seem ‌to be treating the $500 billion purchase intention with a ​degree of scepticism,\" said Dhiraj Nim, an economist at ANZ.\n\nThe U.S. is India's top export destination, ​accounting for nearly a fifth of the Asian nation's entire shipments in the fiscal ‌year 2024-25.\n\nIf exports hold near pre-tariff levels ​and imports rise sharply, India's ​largest bilateral surplus could shrink and widen its overall trade deficit. India had a total goods trade deficit of $283.5 billion in 2024-25.\n\n\"If it is a $100 billion every year, it will completely upset ​India's trade balance,\" said independent trade ‌expert Biswajit Dhar.",

    "description": "The United States and India have released an interim framework for a trade deal, paving the way for an agreement that would lower",
    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 9 (Reuters) - The United States and India have released an interim framework for a trade deal, paving the way for an agreement that would lower tariffs, reconfigure energy ties and deepen economic cooperation ​as both seek to realign global supply chains.\n\nThe India–U.S. joint statement suggested that New Delhi pushed back against Washington's efforts to ‌broadly open its agricultural market. However, India has agreed to lower trade barriers on some farm goods, drawing criticism from farmers and opposition parties.\n\nWHO GAINS FROM INDIA'S DECISION TO ALLOW ‌IMPORTS OF DDGS AND SOYOIL, AND WHO LOSES OUT?\n\nIndia is expected to allow imports of protein-rich distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), a byproduct of ethanol made from corn and other grains, from the United States, adding to a surplus in the domestic market.\n\nHigher supplies of DDGS could benefit India's nearly $30 billion poultry sector, where feed costs account for around 60-70% of total production expenses, by helping reduce expensive feed purchases.\n\nDomestic oilseed processors and soybean farmers, however, may ⁠lose out if U.S. imports rise.\n\nThere are already ‌surplus supplies of DDGS in India, weakening demand for oilmeals such as soyameal, putting pressure on Indian oilseed prices and prompting farmers to switch from soybean and peanuts to corn and rice, despite New Delhi's push to boost ‍oilseed cultivation and curb imports.\n\nAs supplies of DDGS increase further, India's ethanol producers - already struggling with idle capacity and slowing demand after the country achieved its 20% biofuel blending target - may face lower earnings from DDGS sales in the domestic market.\n\nProspects of duty-free imports of soyoil from the U.S. have raised some concerns in India. ​But, under the current framework, duty-free soyoil imports will be allowed only under a tariff-rate quota, meaning volumes above the quota will face ‌standard tariffs, a move aimed at protecting domestic producers.\n\nWILL DUTY-FREE COTTON IMPORTS AFFECT INDIAN FARMERS?\n\nIndia currently imposes an 11% duty on cotton imports, and allowing duty-free imports from the world's largest exporter of the fiber could put pressure on domestic prices.\n\nHowever, the impact is expected to be limited, as the government has permitted only imports of extra-long staple cotton, and that too under a quota.\n\nAlthough India is the world's second-largest cotton producer, it struggles to meet the textile industry's demand for extra-long staple cotton, which it imports from the U.S., Egypt, Brazil and Australia.\n\nDO CONCESSIONAL IMPORTS OF APPLES ⁠AND DRY FRUITS THREATEN INDIAN FARMERS?\n\nIndia is the world's fifth-largest apple producer, but domestic ​supplies fall short of rising demand, driven by population growth and increasing prosperity.\n\nNew Delhi ​imports around 500,000 metric tons of apples annually from Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan, the U.S. and Chile. Under a trade deal with the U.S., imports will be allowed at a concessional duty of 25% and a minimum import price of 80 ‍rupees per kg, effectively preventing shipments ⁠below 100 rupees per kg and helping protect Indian farmers.\n\nConsumption of dry fruits such as walnuts, almonds and pistachios has also been rising in India. Domestic production of these commodities is limited, so concessional imports are unlikely to affect local farmers.\n\nARE INDIAN FARMERS LIKELY ⁠TO BENEFIT FROM THE TRADE DEAL?\n\nIndian growers of tea, coffee, spices and fruits are set to gain from the trade deal, as the U.S. has granted duty-free access for ‌these products.\n\nThe reduction of import duties on rice to 18% is also expected to support exporters of both premium basmati and ‌non-basmati varieties.",

    "fullText": "Bangladesh have requested that Pakistan end their planned boycott of their T20 World Cup match against India, opening the door for the fixture to be played on 15 February as scheduled.\n\nThe match, the biggest and most lucrative in cricket, has been in doubt since the Pakistan government advised its team not to take the field against their long-time rivals.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that initial decision was made to \"support\" Bangladesh, who had a request for their matches to be moved out of India rejected and subsequently pulled out of the tournament.\n\nBut, after talks between officials at the Pakistan Cricket Board, the International Cricket Council and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) in Lahore on Sunday, BCB president Ameenul Islam requested the match go ahead \"for the benefit of the entire cricket ecosystem\".\n\n\"We are deeply moved by Pakistan's efforts to go above and beyond in supporting Bangladesh during this period. Long may our brotherhood flourish,\" he added.\n\nThe match is scheduled to take place in the city of Colombo in Sri Lanka, the co-hosts for the tournament with India.\n\nPakistan will forfeit the points from the group-stage match should it not be played but the team's absence from the tournament would also have longer-term consequences for cricket.\n\nIt could lead to disputes over the ICC's current rights deals and continued uncertainty would likely impact future agreements, with the current TV deals set to run out after the 2027 World Cup.\n\nMany of the smaller cricketing nations rely on the money distributed by the ICC, so any cut in revenue would likely hit such countries hardest.\n\n\"Following my short visit to Pakistan yesterday and given the forthcoming outcomes of our discussions, I request Pakistan to play the ICC T20 World Cup game on 15 February against India for the benefit of the entire cricket ecosystem,\" Islam said.\n\nWhile stopping short of confirming the match will go ahead, the ICC released a statement on Monday evening confirming Bangladesh will not be sanctioned for their boycott.\n\nIt also said Bangladesh will host an ICC event between 2028 and the start of the 2031 World Cup.\n\n\"The ICC, PCB and BCB, along with other members, remain committed to continued dialogue, cooperation and constructive engagement in the best interests of the sport,\" a statement said.\n\n\"All stakeholders acknowledge that the spirit of this understanding is to protect the integrity of the game and preserve unity within the cricket fraternity.\"\n\nThere were no details on what event Bangladesh would host. All men's events have been confirmed up until 2031, with Bangladesh already scheduled to co-host the 2031 World Cup with India.\n\nThe hosts of women's tournaments have been chosen up to 2027, while the ICC also holds Under-19 World Cups.\n\nThe PCB has been contacted for comment.\n\nWhat next in Pakistan-India controversy as ICC confirm forfeit stance?",

    "description": "India has scrapped a planned concession for small cars in upcoming fuel-efficiency rules after automakers including Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra",
    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 9 (Reuters) - India has scrapped a planned concession for small cars in upcoming fuel-efficiency rules after automakers including Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra argued ​it would benefit only one company, a government document shows.\n\nA September draft had proposed leniency ‌for petrol cars weighing 909 kg (2,004 lb) or less - a carve-out widely seen as favouring Maruti Suzuki, which controls 95% of ‌India's small‑car market.\n\nIndia's Power Ministry has now removed that exemption and tightened other parameters, increasing pressure on all automakers to ramp up electric and hybrid car sales, according to the latest 41-page draft reviewed by Reuters.\n\nThe new rules curb over-compensation for vehicle weight, aim to level the field between light and heavy fleet ⁠manufacturers, and are designed to deliver ‌real-world efficiency gains, the document said.\n\nThey introduce \"a substantially steeper reduction pathway\" for emissions, it added.\n\nThe power ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPROMOTING ELECTRIC, HYBRID ‍MODELS\n\nTransport accounts for about 12% of India's energy use and is a major driver of petroleum imports and carbon emissions. Passenger vehicles make up nearly 90% of transport-related emissions, the document says.\n\nCorporate Average Fuel Efficiency norms dictate permissible ​CO2 emissions across a manufacturer's fleet of passenger cars weighing less than 3,500 kg (7,716 lb). Updated ‌every five years, they push automakers towards cleaner technologies including electrification, compressed natural gas and flex-fuel.\n\nThe new rules will apply from April 2027 for five years and are central to automakers' product and powertrain investment plans. It was not immediately clear when the rules will be finalised.\n\nThe September draft would have allowed fuel-consumption targets to rise faster with vehicle weight, easing compliance for makers of heavier cars such as ⁠Mahindra, Tata and Volkswagen, while tightening demands on lighter-fleet players ​such as Maruti. That imbalance prompted the carve-out.\n\nThe revised plan ​reduces the extent to which heavier vehicles gain more relaxed targets.\n\n\"Manufacturers with heavier fleets ... are required to achieve stronger intrinsic efficiency improvements,\" the document said.\n\nA credit system will ‍reward companies that sell more ⁠EVs and plug-in hybrids, and pooling of fuel-consumption performance between companies will be allowed. Non-compliance will draw penalties of up to $550 per car.\n\nThe revised plan aims to cut average fleet emissions ⁠to about 100 grams/km over the five years to March 2032 from 114 grams/km. With credits, that could fall to ‌as low as 76 grams/km if electric models reach 11% of total car sales ‌by 2032.",

    "fullText": "Whether it be the unforgettable St. Patrick's Day against Pakistan in 2007, or Kevin O'Brien thumping a rapid century to beat England four years later, Ireland's history at World Cups is one built upon giant killings.\n\nBut if those historic days, and a few more besides against the likes of West Indies, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh, all helped to create a reputation for over-performance at global showpieces, it has been a contrasting story at T20 World Cups.\n\nIndeed, as Ireland prepare to start their 2026 campaign against co-hosts Sri Lanka on Sunday, the presence of Oman in their group is a reminder that in the shorter format, the shoe has more often been on the other foot.\n\nIt was 10 years ago in India that defeat by the tournament debutants first up sent Ireland on their way to one of their six early exits from eight attempts, while it was the same old story in the USA last time around when a 12-run loss to Canada, with an assist from the weather, did the damage.\n\nWith Australia to follow Sri Lanka this time around, before facing Oman and then Zimbabwe in Pool B, if Heinrich Malan's side are to reverse the trend in the coming 10 days, they must ensure they are again the ones administering the shocks rather than finding themselves on the receiving end.\n\nSaturday, 8 February 2026, 13:30 GMT\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live text with in-play clips.\n\nWhile Ireland lost three of their six scheduled T20s to the weather during a wholly frustrating home summer in 2025, in the months since they have at least had the benefit of regular cricket.\n\nHarry Tector and Matthew Humphreys led the way for an encouraging T20 win over Bangladesh in November before consecutive losses to surrender the series gave the impression of a side who had run out of steam at the end of the multi-format tour.\n\nA 2-1 series win over Italy followed by a two-game whitewash of the UAE have formed the bulk of preparations for the World Cup, but a final tune-up against Pakistan on Wednesday fell victim to the rain, robbing the side of the chance to step up against the sort of superior opposition they will face in their first two games in Sri Lanka.\n\nAcross the five warm-up games in Dubai, there is the sense that the side have chanced upon their optimum line-up for the conditions in Sri Lanka, although perhaps the solution involved the loss of form one of their leading lights.\n\nTector and Humphreys continue to lead the way with bat and ball respectively, with the former averaging 43 across his past eight T20 internationals to form a strong middle-order with wicket-keeper Lorcan Tucker.\n\nRoss Adair, who still has Ireland's most recent T20 century to his name thanks to his knock against South Africa in 2024, appears to have held off the challenge of the younger Tector brother, Tim, to open alongside captain Paul Stirling.\n\nDespite the skipper averaging 20 across the 16 T20s Ireland have played since the last World Cup, the 35-year-old remains the side's best player against the spin bowling they are sure to face in Sri Lankan conditions.\n\nThe bowling resurgence of veteran all-rounder George Dockrell - who took four wickets for 53 runs from 13 overs in the warm-ups - allows for the lengthening of the batting line-up where 23-year-old Ben Calitz will be relied upon to provide some left-handed thump.\n\nIt is all, however, expected to be at the expense of a genuine quick. An out-of-sorts Josh Little did not feature in either match against the UAE after not managing a wicket in two games against both Bangladesh and Italy with an economy rate ranging between 9.50 and 13.50.\n\nThe player who took a memorable T20 World Cup hat-trick against New Zealand in 2022, and indeed had figures of 4-23 against Sunday's opposition a year prior, looks likely to start the tournament outside the starting XI.\n\nWith Mark Adair, Ireland's leading T20 wicket-taker there to shoulder the load in terms of seam, it means Malan's selection can all, in one way or another, take some confidence from their preparations.\n\nWhether that transfers to facing the likes of Sri Lanka and Australia, however, will be the determining factor in Ireland's efforts.\n\nAustralia's Hazlewood ruled out of T20 World Cup\n\nScotland beaten by West Indies in T20 World Cup opener\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "India 161-9 (20 overs): Suryakumar 84*; Van Schalkwyk 4-25\n\nUSA 132-8 (20 overs): Ranjane 37, Krishnamurthi 37; Siraj 3-29\n\nSuryakumar Yadav rescued India from an almighty scare and ensured the T20 World Cup co-hosts opened their tournament with a 29-run victory over the United States in Mumbai.\n\nAfter being put into bat the defending champions and overwhelming favourites slumped to 77-6, putting them at risk of the biggest shock in cricket history – and one of the biggest upsets in any sport.\n\nBut the US crucially dropped Suryakumar on 15. Bowler Shubham Ranjane, one of five India-born players in USA's XI, was the guilty party low in his follow-through.\n\nThe India captain punished the miss with a brilliant 84 not out from 49 balls, countering the situation perfectly by starting slowly before unfurling thrilling scoops and flicks to drag the hosts to 161-9.\n\nThat denied the underdogs any momentum and India seamers Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Siraj took three wickets in the first four overs of the chase to reduce the US to 13-3.\n\nAs the required run-rate climbed, the expectant locals grew more comfortable and the US scrapped to 132-8 in their 20 overs without ever threatening to complete the chase.\n\nIt means, after an entertaining opening day in which the Netherlands were a dropped catch away from stunning Pakistan and Scotland threatened West Indies, India set the early pace at the top of Group A as expected in this World Cup.\n\nEngland enter the tournament on Sunday with a fixture against Nepal at 09:30 GMT. Ireland play Sri Lanka in Colombo at 13:30.\n\nT20 World Cup: India seal opening-day win over USA - reaction\n\nIndia's margin of victory was, in the end, comfortable.\n\nMake no mistake, however. The upset, which would have topped USA's super over win over Pakistan at the last T20 World Cup, was on at one stage.\n\nThe home crowd was quiet and in the 13th over Suryakumar and Axar Patel were at the crease with only three tailenders remaining.\n\nThe US, who have not played a T20 since April amid governance issues and are ranked 18th in the world, bowled superbly.\n\nIndia opener Abhishek Sharma, many people's tip for player of the tournament, slashed his first ball to deep cover and when South Africa-born seamer Shadley van Schalkwyk mixed his pace to take three wickets in the sixth over, including Tilak Verma and Shivam Dube in consecutive deliveries, the hosts were 46-4.\n\nSuryakumar - known by his nickname SKY - defended Van Schalkwyk's hat-trick ball and took only five runs from his first 10 deliveries and 20 from his first 21.\n\nHis team-mates all struggled to time the ball but he took time to feel comfortable, putting on 41 with Axar.\n\nMaking the most of the reprieve by Ranjane, Suryakumar was playing trademark sweeps off seamers for six and tumbling scoops by the end with the US hurt by the loss of Ali Khan to injury with two of his overs unbowled.\n\nIndia's captain took 20 runs from the last over, meaning he ended the innings with 10 runs more than the 74 his team-mates managed combined.\n\nIt was a spectacular and much-needed knock.\n\nT20 World Cup: India seal opening-day win over USA - reaction\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "Still two-years younger than what Sachin Tendulkar's age was at the time of his India debut, he has a bat-swing that reminds of Brian Charles Lara, Harmanpreet Kaur, and Yuvraj Singh, and like footballer Lamine Yamal, who has emerged as a teenage sensation at the highest level, Sooryavanshi’s age has rarely matched the stage he performs on.",
    "fullText": "Conventional wisdom suggests that a 13-year-old would struggle to even face deliveries bowled at speeds above 90 mph. Vaibhav Sooryavanshi has challenged that assumption by striking bowlers such as Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna and Jofra Archer to all parts of the ground.\n\nIn traditional cricket coaching, batters are taught to keep their hands close to the body during the backlift to maintain control over the bat swing. Sooryavanshi differs here as well. His backlift moves away from the body, going against what is often described as textbook technique.\n\nStill two-years younger than what Sachin Tendulkar's age was at the time of his India debut, he has a bat-swing that reminds of Brian Charles Lara, Harmanpreet Kaur, and Yuvraj Singh; and like footballer Lamine Yamal, who has emerged as a teenage sensation at the highest level, Sooryavanshi’s age has rarely matched the stage and level he performs on.\n\nTalent could never be the question with Vaibhav Sooryavanshi. It never was. With the 80-ball 175 knock against England in the Under-19 World Cup final on Friday, he also put to rest any talks of temperament too, with delivering on the biggest of stages.\n\nSooryavanshi produced what can be counted among the most dominant innings in Under-19 World Cup history. His 175, which included 15 sixes, helped India post 411 for 9 against England in the final at Harare.\n\nEngland, under pressure after Sooryavanshi’s innings, were bowled out for 311 in 40.2 overs while chasing a target of 412 against India’s bowling attack.\n\nThe 14-year-old reached his century in 55 balls, becoming the second-fastest centurion in the history of the Under-19 World Cup.\n\nHis innings is the highest individual score in an Under-19 World Cup final and came in the match that also produced the highest team total in a final of the tournament.\n\nSooryavanshi reached his first fifty in 32 balls and continued at the same pace against the England bowlers. His second fifty came off 23 balls.\n\nOut of his 175 runs, 150 came through boundaries, with 15 sixes and an equal number of fours. During this phase, India’s scoring rate stayed close to 10 runs an over, and the projected total crossed 500 midway through the innings.\n\nHe now holds the record for most sixes in a Youth ODI innings, surpassing his own mark of 14 sixes against UAE at ICCA Dubai in December.\n\nSooryavanshi also owns the record for the fastest 150 in Under-19 cricket, reaching the mark in 71 balls. The previous record was held by England’s Ben Mayes, who took 98 balls against Scotland at the same venue earlier in the tournament.\n\nVedant Trivedi, batting at the other end, faced only four deliveries between Sooryavanshi’s 100 and 150, underlining the speed at which the runs were scored.\n\nSooryavanshi first came into wider attention in November 2024 when he became the youngest player to receive an IPL contract after Rajasthan Royals signed him for Rs 1.10 crore. He was 13 years and 243 days old at the time. By then, he had already represented India Under-19 and scored a century as an opener against Australia Under-19 in a four-day match in Chennai.\n\nOne of the early highlights of his career was the 58-ball century against Australia Under-19, where he scored 104. At 13 years and 187 days, he became the youngest player to score a century in youth cricket, breaking the previous record held by Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto.\n\nIn the following months, Sooryavanshi continued to add records. On April 19, 2025, he made his IPL debut for Rajasthan Royals against Lucknow Super Giants, hitting Shardul Thakur for a six over extra cover off his first ball. He scored 34 off 20 balls in that match.\n\nIn his third IPL appearance, he scored a 35-ball century against Gujarat Titans, whose bowling attack included Mohammed Siraj, Ishant Sharma and Rashid Khan. The hundred was the second-fastest in IPL history, behind only Chris Gayle’s 30-ball century in 2013.\n\nIn July 2025, Sooryavanshi recorded the fastest Youth ODI century at the time, reaching the milestone in 52 balls. That record was later broken by Pakistan’s Sameer Minhas, who scored a century off 42 balls against Zimbabwe Under-19.\n\nHe was named Bihar’s vice-captain for the first two rounds of the 2025–26 Ranji Trophy season in October. The decision followed his performances on India Under-19's tour of Australia, where he provided quick starts and scored a 78-ball century in the first four-day match in Brisbane. He finished as the second-highest run-scorer of the series, with 133 runs in three innings as India won 2-0.\n\nIn November 2025, Sooryavanshi scored 144 off 42 balls for India A against UAE in the Asia Cup Rising Stars. His century came off 32 balls and was then the joint-third fastest by an Indian in men’s T20 cricket.\n\nA few weeks later, he scored 171 off 95 balls against UAE Under-19 in the opening match of the Under-19 Asia Cup.\n\nAt 14 years and 272 days, Sooryavanshi became the youngest player to score a century in men’s List A cricket. He achieved the feat while playing for Bihar against Arunachal Pradesh in the 2025–26 Vijay Hazare Trophy. He reached his century in 36 balls, later scoring the fastest 150 in men’s List A cricket off 59 balls. He was dismissed for 190 off 84 balls, which included 16 fours and 15 sixes.\n\nSooryavanshi scored 439 runs and took 1 wicket in the Under-19 World Cup and was named Player of the Tournament after India won their sixth Under-19 World Cup title on Friday.\n\n\"I had faith in my skills that I can contribute in big games and today it happened,\" Sooryavanshi said at the post-match presentation.\n\nAt 14, Sooryavanshi is already a world champion. He has delivered on most opportunities given to him so far. But he's still a kid. It's important to give him space and not put too many expectations on him. Leave him freely and watch him take the cricketing world by storm.",

    "description": "A guide to the 2026 ICC Men's T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka, which begins on 7 February and runs until 8 March.",
    "fullText": "It is almost time for the 2026 ICC Men's T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.\n\nIndia head into the tournament as defending champions following their success in the Caribbean and United States in 2024.\n\nThey are strong favourites in their home conditions - but the unpredictable nature of T20 cricket makes for an exciting tournament.\n\nHere is a full guide to the 10th edition of the men's 20-over global showpiece.\n\nThe 2026 Men's T20 World Cup starts on 7 February at 05:30 GMT with Pakistan facing the Netherlands in Colombo.\n\nIt is one of three games on the opening day, with the West Indies v Scotland at 09:30 and India v USA at 15:30.\n\nThe initial 20-team group stage, that sees four groups of five, continues until 20 February, with three games every day at the same times as above, bar the final day when there is just one game at 13:30.\n\nThe Super 8s follow with one or two games a day at 09:30 and 13:30, before the semi-finals across 4 and 5 March.\n\nThe final is on Sunday, 8 March at 13:30 BST in Ahmedabad.\n\nFull T20 World Cup fixture list including start times and venues\n\nThe 2026 Men's T20 World Cup follows the same format as 2024, which was the tournament's biggest with 20 sides taking part.\n\nAll of the teams are involved from the off in an initial group stage, with each side playing four games and the top two progressing to the Super 8s.\n\nThe Super 8s, which will take place across India and Sri Lanka, will consist of two groups of four, with eight sides seeded to help with the planning and schedule.\n\nThose eight sides are: Australia, India, South Africa, West Indies (Group 1) and England, New Zealand, Pakistan and Sri Lanka (Group 2).\n\nShould those sides progress they will go into their respective group based on their seeding, rather than their finishing position in the initial group phase.\n\nIn the Super 8s, the top two teams progress to the semi-finals with the winner of each group facing the runner-up in the other.\n\nThroughout both phases teams are awarded two points for a win, one for a no result and zero for a loss. There's no ties in T20 cricket - more on that below!\n\nAll 12 Test-playing nations have qualified for the tournament after Zimbabwe came through their qualifying stage.\n\nItaly are the only tournament debutants, while Canada are at their first global tournament since 2014.\n\nScotland were a late replacement for Bangladesh, who pulled out of the tournament after the governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), refused to meet their request to play their matches in Sri Lanka rather than India due to safety concerns amid rising tensions between the two countries.\n\nScotland, who were the highest-ranked side to not qualify, took Bangladesh's place in Group C and will fulfill their fixtures as scheduled.\n\nPakistan also considered a full boycott, but their government has decided it can play in the tournament, apart from the game against India on 15 February. The impact of that decision is yet to be communicated by the ICC.\n\nThey will play their games in Sri Lanka as part of an agreement reached in 2024 around India and Pakistan matches not being played in the other country.\n\nThe 20 sides are split into the following four groups in the initial phase:\n\nGroup A: India (X1), Namibia, Netherlands, Pakistan (Y3), USA\n\nGroup B: Australia (X2), Ireland, Oman, Sri Lanka (Y4), Zimbabwe\n\nGroup C: England (Y1), Italy, Nepal, Scotland, West Indies (X3)\n\nGroup D: Afghanistan, Canada, New Zealand (Y2), South Africa (X4), United Arab Emirates\n\nFull squad lists for the 2026 Men's T20 World Cup\n\nA total of eight venues are being used - five in India and three in Sri Lanka.\n\nIn India, Eden Gardens in Kolkata, Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad and Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi will host games.\n\nR Premadasa Stadium and Sinhalese Sports Club Ground - both in Colombo - and Pallekele Cricket Stadium put on matches in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Narendra Modi Stadium, which holds 132,000 fans and is the biggest cricket venue in the world, is due to host the final, unless Pakistan qualify, with the game then moved to Colombo.\n\nThe tournament is played in a T20 format, so both teams will face 20 overs unless they are bowled out beforehand or the team batting second reaches their target before then.\n\nEach innings will start with a six-over powerplay and there are different fielding restrictions in that phase.\n\nMatches should last three hours and 10 minutes, with each innings allocated one hour and 25 minutes and separated by a 20-minute interval.\n\nIn limited-overs cricket there is a 'stop-clock' meaning the bowling side must be ready to bowl each over within 60 seconds of the previous one finishing.\n\nEach side will be allowed two unsuccessful reviews per innings.\n\nShould the number of runs scored by each team be level after 20 overs, the match will go to a super over (each team will face six balls - highest score wins). If that finishes a tie then super overs will continue to be played until a winner is found.\n\nIn the two group phases a minimum of five overs per side must be played to constitute a result, but that rises to 10 overs in the semi-finals and final.\n\nIf a match is halted after that point due to weather conditions then DLS (Duckworth Lewis Stern method) will be used to decide the winner.\n\nThe ICC are yet to publish playing conditions around reserve days and extra time allocated to the knockout matches.\n\nIf Pakistan reach the semi-finals, Colombo's R. Premadasa Stadium will replace Kolkata as the venue for the first semi-final, while the final would also move if Pakistan qualify.\n\nIf India make the last four and face any side that is not Pakistan, they will play in the second semi-final in Mumbai on 5 March.\n\nGlossary of cricket terms including DLS and powerplay\n\nThere have been six winners of the nine Men's T20 World Cups. They are:\n\nThere will be ball-by-ball commentary of all 55 matches across BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nOur commentary team includes Henry Moeran, Prakash Wakankar, Aatif Nawaz, Daniel Norcross, Simon Mann, Nikesh Rughani, Kevin Howells and Melissa Story.\n\nExpert analysis will come from multiple Ashes winner Steven Finn, World Cup winner Alex Hartley, T20 World Cup champion Dawid Malan, Scotland and England T20 World Cup spinner Kirstie Gordon, former Ireland wicketkeeper Niall O'Brien and Big Bash winner Michael Carberry.\n\nThe BBC Sport website and app will have live text commentary on selected group-stage matches then every match from the Super 8s onwards.\n\nThere will be daily reports and score updates alongside in-play and post-match video highlights, alongside regular coverage on the BBC Cricket Instagram, external account.\n\nThe tournament is available to watch live in the UK on Sky Sports.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Under-19 World Cup, final, Harare\n\nIndia 411-9 (50.0 overs): Suryavanshi 175 (80); Minto 3-63\n\nIndia teenager Vaibhav Suryavanshi made a stunning 175 from just 80 balls in the Under-19 World Cup final against England.\n\nThe 14-year-old hammered 15 sixes and 15 fours at a strike rate of 218.75 during a brutal and breathtaking knock at the Harare Sports Club in Zimbabwe.\n\nHe scored 24 off his first 24 balls, meaning his last 151 runs came off just 56 deliveries.\n\nSuryavanshi's 126-minute stay at the crease was eventually ended by England seamer Manny Lumsden in the 26th over to leave India 251-3.\n\nLumsden took pace off the ball and Suryavanshi gloved an attempted slog sweep to England captain and wicketkeeper Thomas Rew.\n\nA number of England's players shook Suryavanshi's hand as he left the field in recognition of the brilliance of his innings.\n\nIndia finished on 411-9 from their 50 overs - the fifth highest total in U19 World Cup history and a record for a final eclipsing the 253-7 made by Australia against India in the 2024 final.\n\nSuryavanshi's score took his World Cup tally to 439 runs in seven innings at 62.71 - four runs clear of Afghanistan's Faisal Khan as the tournament's leading run-scorer.\n\nSome other notable statistics from Suryavanshi's innings:\n\nIt was the highest score in an Under-19 World Cup final, beating Unmukt Chand's 111* for India in the 2012 final against Australia.\n\nThe innings gives him the ninth highest score in the history of youth ODIs. South Africa's Jorich van Schalkwyk (215 vs Zimbabwe) is the only player to make a double century.\n\nIt was the sixth-highest individual score in the history of all matches played at U19 World Cups.\n\nHis knock included the record for most sixes (15) in a youth ODI innings, beating his own record of 14 against the United Arab Emirates at last year's U19 Asia Cup.\n\nHis 15 sixes is the highest number in an Under-19 World Cup innings. Only two other players have managed double digits.\n\nThe century off 55 balls is the second fastest in U19 World Cups, behind Will Malajczuk's 51-ball hundred for Australia against Japan earlier in this year's tournament\n\nIt is the latest achievement for Suryavanshi, who shot to global fame in April last year when he smashed his first ball in the Indian Premier League for six.\n\nHe then became the youngest player to hit a century in men's T20s when he made a 35-ball hundred for Rajasthan Royals against Gujarat Titans.\n\nIt was also the second-fastest century in IPL history, behind Chris Gayle's 30-ball ton in 2013.\n\nIn July 2025, he struck what was then the fastest recorded century in a youth ODI, making 143 from 78 balls as India beat England by 55 runs at Worcester.\n\nHe took 52 balls to reach three figures, bettering Kamran Ghulam's 53-ball effort for Pakistan against England in 2013.\n\nFour months later, he struck a 32-ball century in India A's victory against the United Arab Emirates in their Asia Cup Rising Stars T20 match. He was eventually dismissed for 144 from 42 balls.\n\nListen to ball-by-ball commentary of the final on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "With the T20 World Cup beginning on Saturday, BBC Sport looks at the trends and tactics from the global game that may play a part in India and Sri Lanka.",
    "fullText": "It may be just 19 months since India lifted the T20 World Cup in Barbados but the latest edition begins in Colombo on Saturday.\n\nAs ever, the tournament in India and Sri Lanka will likely be one of sixes and runs.\n\nBefore it all begins, we have taken a look at what has been going on in international and franchise games over recent years and predicted some trends and tactics to watch out for...\n\nThe option for a team to call in a batter who is struggling and chewing up too many balls has always been there.\n\n2025 was the year retiring batters out hit the mainstream.\n\nThere were 26 instances of that 'dismissal' in international and domestic T20s last year - almost 50% of the total number in the history of the format.\n\nIt has also happened twice more since the turn of the year in the Big Bash, while Northern Districts retired out two batters in the same innings in New Zealand's Super Smash in January.\n\nA batter has retired out in a T20 World Cup before - in a match involving England no less - when Namibia batter Nikolaas Davin walked off to allow David Wiese to come to the middle in the 2024 group stage.\n\nBut with the stigma around the move gone, could this be the tournament of the retired out?\n\nNot since 2013 have spinners bowled as much at the death in T20s as they did in 2025.\n\nFor a long while, the death overs - regarded as the last five in an innings for this data - have been left largely to seamers and their mix of yorkers, slower balls and hard lengths. That is changing.\n\nIn 2025, 24% of balls bowled at the death in T20s between full member nations were delivered by spinners - and with some success.\n\nSpinners' economy rate at the death has dropped around 1.5 runs per over in the past two years to 7.68 runs per over. Last year, spinners had a better economy at the finish than seamers.\n\nAfghanistan, unsurprisingly given the quality of their options, have used spin regularly at the death. More than half of their deliveries in the final five overs were bowled by spinners.\n\nIndia were the next most frequent users of the tactic, followed by Sri Lanka and, interestingly, England.\n\nWhile England captain and when leading Northern Superchargers in The Hundred since 2024, Harry Brook has had spinners bowling 42.2% of his deliveries at the death.\n\nFormer captain Jos Buttler's figure in that time was just 19.7%.\n\nThis may be less of a surprise, given fast scoring and six-hitting has been on an upward trajectory since T20's inception.\n\nLast year was a big jump, however, with batting strike-rates for all players in all men's T20s tipping over 130 for the first time. The increase from 2024 was more than eight runs per 100 balls.\n\nThe introduction of the Indian Premier League's player impact rule has boosted scoring rates there - teams effectively can field an extra batter when needed - but the rise is reflected in internationals too.\n\nA six was also hit every 17.4 deliveries across all T20s last year - the figure was at 23.1 as recently as 2021.\n\nSixes are now hit more than twice as often than in the format's first year in 2003.\n\nWe are all familiar with the term match-up these days.\n\nIt has become commonplace in T20 - and increasingly in Test cricket - and describes how some batters are suited to styles of bowling and vice-versa.\n\nWhen it comes to batting against spin, the logic goes that batters are more vulnerable when facing a bowler who turns the ball away from them - a leg-spinner to right-handers and off-spinner to left-handers.\n\nWhat is interesting, however, is how all of those at the top of the T20 batting rankings, bar Australia's openers Mitchell Marsh and Travis Head as shown below, all have strong records against their perceived negative spin match-up.\n\nIndia's left-handed opener Abhishek Sharma, the world's leading T20 batter, averages 43.3 and strikes at 183.1 runs per 100 balls against off-spin in internationals since the start of 2024.\n\nEngland right-handers Phil Salt and Buttler have strike-rates of 148.4 and 136.8 respectively against left-arm spin alongside solid averages.\n\nThe trend is reflected by the leading spin bowlers too. India's Varun Chakravarthy, Rashid Khan and Adil Rashid all have similar records against right and left-handers.\n\nWhen it gets to the elite level, match-ups are not insignificant but they are not the be all and end all.\n\nAnother thing on the rise is the prevalence of left-handed batters.\n\nIn T20s between full member nations, lefties have never faced a higher percentages of deliveries than the 35% they did in 2025.\n\nThe spike is a sign of some teams switching on to the benefits of right-hand-left-hand batting combinations.\n\nIt makes shorter boundaries harder to defend, messes with bowlers' lengths and negates the threat of those spinning match-ups.\n\nAnd no team uses this more than co-hosts and overwhelming favourites India. It has been a cornerstone of Gautam Gambhir's time as coach.\n\nSince the start of 2024, left-handers have faced 51% of India's deliveries in T20s against full members - a jump from 31% under Rahul Dravid in the run up to the 2024 World Cup.\n\nEngland, in comparison, twice picked a team with only one left-hander in their XI during the tour of India last year.\n\nBut while left-handers only faced 19% of England's deliveries from the start of 2024 to the start of 2026, the selection of Ben Duckett, Jacob Bethell and Sam Curran for this World Cup - all of whom could bat in the top seven - suggests times may, belatedly, be changing.\n\nBut if England are to have any chance in India and Sri Lanka, it feels like Salt and Buttler, their two leading batters, will have to hit form.\n\nAfter Buttler's period at number three, the pair were reunited as openers at the end of last summer and, despite a quiet run for Salt in Sri Lanka, have returned impressive results.\n\nSalt hit scores of 141 not out, 85 and 89 against South Africa and Ireland. Buttler also made 83 against South Africa when an opening stand of 126 sent England on their way to a record 304-2.\n\nSalt, a notoriously aggressive starter, cuts loose from the start, striking at 149.7 in the first two overs of T20s since the start of 2024 - the third best of any opener at this World Cup.\n\nButtler, in comparison, has a strike-rate of just 105 in that time. He sits back and watches Salt do his thing.\n\nBut by the final two overs of the powerplay Buttler is often flying.\n\nThe former captain, having taken a bit of time to get in, has been striking at 172.9 in the fifth and sixth overs, even outdoing Salt's healthy strike-rate of 163.7.\n\nThe pair take on the powerplay in specific and complementary ways.\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "The men's T20 World Cup starts on Saturday against a backdrop of political tension.\n\nThe tournament, which features 20 teams, will be held in India and Sri Lanka.\n\nBangladesh are boycotting it after a request for their fixtures to be switched from India to Sri Lanka was refused by the sport's governing body.\n\nTheir place in Group C has been taken by Scotland.\n\nPakistan had considered boycotting but have since confirmed they will take part, though will not play their scheduled match against India.\n\nBangladesh had asked for their games to be switched from India, citing safety concerns amid growing tensions between the countries.\n\nRelations between the South Asian neighbours have soured since former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India in 2024, following deadly protests.\n\nIndia has not agreed to send her back despite several requests, and violent protests broke out after Sharif Osman Hadi - a prominent student leader in Bangladesh - was shot dead.\n\nIndia itself has raised concerns over violence targeting members of the minority Hindu community in Bangladesh.\n\nIn December, a Hindu man was accused of blasphemy and beaten to death by a mob in an incident that resulted in protests by Hindu nationalist groups in India.\n\nAgainst that political backdrop, Indian Premier League (IPL) side Kolkata Knight Riders released Bangladesh bowler Mustafizur Rahman in January after being instructed to do so by the Board of Control for Cricket in India.\n\nIn response, Bangladeshi authorities banned broadcasts of the IPL in the country.\n\nThe Bangladesh Cricket Board then requested that their World Cup fixtures be played in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe International Cricket Council - the sport's governing body - rejected that request, saying there was an \"absence of any credible security threat\" and gave the BCB a final 24 hours in which to declare their participation.\n\nWhen that deadline passed, Scotland were invited to the tournament.\n\nThe ICC said it was keen not to establish \"precedents that could undermine the neutrality and fairness of ICC events\".\n\nPakistan are boycotting their match against India, which was scheduled to take place in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on 15 February.\n\nIn a statement, the Pakistan government said it granted \"approval\" to the team's participation in the tournament but they \"shall not take to the field\" for the match against India.\n\nPakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi previously said the team could pull out completely after Bangladesh were removed from the tournament.\n\nPakistan and India have not faced each other outside men's major tournaments since 2013, and India have not played in Pakistan since 2008.\n\nPakistan did not host any touring nations between 2009 and 2019 following the Lahore attack on Sri Lanka's team bus, which killed six policemen and two civilians.\n\nPakistani players have also been banned from the IPL since 2009 following the Mumbai attacks that left 174 people - including nine gunmen - dead.\n\nLast year India refused to travel to Pakistan to play in the Champions Trophy and eventually played their matches in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIt resulted in the two nations signing an agreement stating the two countries would play at neutral venues whenever one of them hosts an ICC event.\n\nThe neighbours have fought a number of wars and had several military stand-offs since the partition of India in 1947, when the nation was split into India and the new state of Pakistan. It created an upsurge of violence, in which approximately 15 million people were displaced and an estimated one million died.\n\nRecent escalations were sparked after the neighbours engaged in a four-day military conflict in April 2025 following a deadly militant attack on tourists in India-administered Kashmir.\n\nThe ICC said Pakistan's stance was \"difficult to reconcile\" and called on the country's cricket chiefs to explore a \"mutually acceptable resolution\".\n\nThe governing body said that \"selective participation undermines the spirit and sanctity of the competitions\".\n\nIt said it \"respects the roles of governments in matters of national policy\" but continued: \"This decision is not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide, including millions in Pakistan.\"\n\nIt added it hoped the PCB would \"consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country\".\n\nFormer Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi is among those who have accused the ICC of mishandling the situation.\n\nIn a post on X, he said: \"It's regrettable that Pakistan won't play India, but I stand behind my government's decision.\n\n\"This is the moment for the ICC to lead and prove through decisions, not statements, that it is impartial, independent and fair to every member.\"\n\nMatches between Pakistan and India can draw huge TV audiences.\n\nReportedly, more than 600 million people watched last year's Champions Trophy fixture on Indian streaming platform JioHotstar.\n\nThe ICC has not published its playing conditions for the tournament so it is not known what sanction Pakistan could face.\n\nHowever, the rules for the previous tournament stated: \"If the match is decided by one side conceding defeat or refusing to play, the result shall be stated as match conceded or match awarded, as the case may be.\"\n\nIt is assumed India will be awarded two points for a win and Pakistan's net run-rate will also be hit by the forfeiture.\n\nPakistan face the Netherlands, USA and Namibia in their other group-stage games, and it is unclear what could happen if they were to face India in the final.\n\nTeams have pulled out of tournament fixtures before, with Australia and the West Indies both deciding not to travel to Colombo in the 1996 World Cup that was co-hosted by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.\n\nEngland also decided not to play their 2003 World Cup match against Zimbabwe in Harare, citing security concerns and social unrest in the country.\n\nNone of those nations received a subsequent fine or punishment from the ICC, though all forfeited the matches.\n\nBoth Pakistan and Bangladesh could receive other sanctions as the ICC has a precedent for punishing governments who interfere in the game.\n\nUnder article 2.4 of the ICC constitution, it outlines boards must manage their affairs \"autonomously and ensure that there is no government (or other public or quasi-public body) interference in its governance, regulation and/or administration of cricket\".\n\nIn 2019, Zimbabwe were suspended for three months after the government replaced the cricket board, leading to a freeze on funding and exclusion from World Cup qualifiers.\n\nFour years later, Sri Lanka also lost the right to host the Under-19 World Cup after its government dismissed the national board following poor performances.\n\nBoth nations later had their ICC membership restored.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nICC Men's T20 World Cup - everything you need to know\n\nWho owns the teams competing in The Hundred?\n\nWhat is the 'designated batters' rule introduced by Big Bash League?",

    "fullText": "MUMBAI, Feb 3 (Reuters) - India's financial markets rallied sharply on Tuesday after a trade deal that slashed U.S. tariffs on Indian goods to 18% ​from 50%, a development that investors said lifts a key overhang over the ‌country's stocks, bonds and currency.\n\nIndia's benchmark stock index, the Nifty 50, surged nearly 5%, about 100 points away from ‌its record high hit in January. The rupee climbed over 1% to 90.40 per dollar in early trading. The yield on the country's 10-year benchmark bond declined 5 bps to 6.72%\n\nThe Nifty's rise put it on course for the best one-day gain in five years while the rupee ⁠was on track for its ‌best day since November 2022.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced the deal on social media following a call with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, noting ‍that India had agreed to halt Russian oil purchases and lower trade barriers on U.S. exports.\n\nIndian stock markets and the rupee have been battered since the tariffs were levied by Washington in late August, ​placing them among the worst-performing emerging market assets in 2025, with record foreign investor ‌outflows.\n\nThe trade breakthrough is expected to alleviate the persistent drag, with investors expecting a bounce-back in foreign sentiment and flows into Indian assets.\n\n\"We believe this trade deal announcement should lift a key overhang on Indian equities. Foreign investors who have been net sellers recently might also look to increase their weight to India in light of this announcement,\" said Prashant Paroda, portfolio ⁠manager with AllSpring Global's Intrinsic Emerging Market equities ​team.\n\nThe trade deal is also expected to lift a ​pall of geopolitical uncertainty which had accompanied the U.S.-India trade rift, keeping investors cautious on plowing money into the country.\n\n\"The key tail risk of geopolitical ‍isolation about which investors ⁠were concerned has now been adequately addressed by back-to-back trade deals with the European Union and United States,\" economists at Citi said in a note.\n\nThe breakthrough with the ⁠U.S. comes less than a week after India signed a long-awaited trade deal with the European Union that ‌is expected to eliminate or reduce tariffs on 96.6% of traded goods by ‌value.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Indian stocks and the rupee are set for strong gains on Tuesday after a trade deal that slashes U.S. tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50% in exchange for India halting Russian oil purchases and lowering trade barriers.\n\nHere are some comments from investors and analysts:\n\nRADHIKA RAO, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DBS, ​SINGAPORE:\n\n\"This breakthrough is unmistakably positive for the real economy/exports, sentiment as well as financial markets, while further details are awaited. Textiles, gems & jewellery, engineering goods, leather and chemicals are ‌likely amongst the key gainers.\n\n\"An eventual unveiling of the bilateral trade agreement will provide more details on the beneficiary product lines and trade as well as investment commitments. Domestic markets are expected to witness a relief rally at open, after ‌high tariffs had been one of the key drags on sentiment in the past quarter.\"\n\nCHARU CHANANA, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SAXO, SINGAPORE:\n\n\"This is constructive for Indian equities because it reduces trade policy uncertainty and improves visibility for export-linked earnings - exactly the kind of catalyst that can restart the narrative when global investors have been cautious. But there's a lot we still don't know. If the oil bill rises meaningfully, that can reintroduce inflation and currency sensitivity.\n\n\"The structural story remains strong and the latest budget’s infrastructure and AI push keeps the ‘catch-up’ theme alive. For foreign investors though, the next hurdle is the Indian rupee, which means ⁠the market may look less like a one-way beta trade and ‌more like a dispersion market.\"\n\nMARC VELAN, HEAD OF INVESTMENTS, LUCERNE ASSET MANAGEMENT, SINGAPORE:\n\n\"The trade deal removes a chunk of policy and tariff uncertainty that had been weighing on Indian assets, opening the door for a near-term bounce in the rupee and equities via sentiment and foreign flows, though sustainability will depend ‍on how the deal is implemented rather than the headline itself.\"\n\nTRIDEEP BHATTACHARYA, PRESIDENT & CIO, EQUITIES, EDELWEISS ASSET MANAGEMENT, MUMBAI:\n\n\"The reduction in tariffs from around 50% to ~18% has come in materially better than consensus expectations. When combined with the recently concluded India–EU trade agreement, this potentially represents one of the strongest external growth stimuli for the Indian economy in 2026.\"\n\nLAKSHMAN VENKITARAMAN, ASSOCIATE PORTFOLIO MANAGER, WASTACH GLOBAL, SALT LAKE CITY:\n\n\"We believe the trade deal improves ​investor sentiment toward India. While the U.S. is India’s largest trading partner, exports to the U.S. account for less than 5% of India’s GDP. Nonetheless, U.S.-India trade frictions have weighed on foreign ‌investor perception. This has been compounded by a global trade focused on AI, which has disproportionately benefited markets such as Taiwan and Korea.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - India's government on Sunday handed a major win to Apple by allowing foreign companies to provide machines to their contract manufacturers in certain areas for five years ​without any tax risk.\n\nApple has been growing in India in recent years as it diversifies beyond China. Counterpoint Research ‌says iPhone's share of the Indian market has doubled to 8% since 2022. And while China still accounts for 75% of global iPhone shipments, India's share ‌has quadrupled to 25% since 2022.\n\nWhat is Apple's current market position in India?\n\nWhat tax changes did India make for Apple?\n\nWhy was Apple concerned about India's tax laws?\n\nHow will this benefit Apple's manufacturing strategy?\n\nApple had been lobbying India's government to modify its income tax laws to ensure the company is not taxed for ownership of the high-end iPhone machinery it provides to its contract manufacturers.\n\nIn India, unlike China, Apple was concerned that if it paid for machines for its contract manufacturers, Indian law could consider that a so-called \"business connection\" and impose taxes on its iPhone sales profits. ⁠That had forced its contract manufacturers Foxconn and ‌Tata to themselves spend billions of dollars on machines.\n\nIndia on Sunday said that \"to promote manufacturing of electronic goods for a contract manufacturer\", it is making certain law changes to ensure that mere ownership of ‍machines by a foreign company does not lead to taxes on it.\n\nThe decision was made public as part of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's 2026-27 annual budget, presented on Sunday.\n\nThe move could prompt Apple and other companies to invest rapidly in the electronics manufacturing space by taking over initial ​expenses for pricey machines, reducing the initial cost burden on contract manufacturers they partner with.\n\n\"We are saying that if you bring ‌your machine, and that machine is used by a local manufacturer to produce something, we will ... exempt you for 5 years. We are giving them certainty,\" Revenue Secretary Arvind Shrivastava said at a post-budget press conference.\n\nFASTER SCALE-UP AND GREATER CONFIDENCE\n\nSmartphone manufacturing is a key plank of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's agenda for economic growth.\n\nThe rule change will apply until the 2030-31 tax year and only to factories set up in so-called customs-bonded areas - which are technically considered being outside India’s customs border. If devices are sold within India from ⁠such factories, they will attract import taxes, making such facilities attractive only ​for exports.\n\n\"Any income arising on account of providing capital goods, equipment or tooling ​to a contract manufacturer, being a company resident in India, is eligible for exemption,\" the Indian government said in one of its explanatory budget documents.",

    "fullText": "MUMBAI, Jan 30 (Reuters) - India's foreign exchange reserves rose to a record high of $709.41 billion as of ​January 23, compared with $701.36 billion a week earlier, the ‌Reserve Bank of India said on Friday.\n\nForex reserves have risen sharply over ‌the past two weeks as the central bank conducted forex swaps to infuse rupee liquidity into the domestic markets and the value of its gold holdings rose.\n\nThe central bank's gold ⁠holdings are now valued ‌at $123 billion, jumping $5.6 billion over the week.\n\nThe central bank has been actively intervening by selling ‍dollars to protect the rupee, which is trading at record lows. The impact of the dollar sales, however, has been offset by ​the rising value of assets such as gold and due ‌to longer-term forex swaps.\n\n\"Despite the Reserve Bank of India's interventions to support the rupee, FX reserves have been growing due to the sharp rise in gold prices and the value of non-dollar assets due to appreciation in currencies like ⁠the euro and Japanese yen,\" said ​Sakshi Gupta, principal economist at HDFC ​Bank.\n\nChanges in foreign currency assets, expressed in dollar terms, include the effect of appreciation or depreciation ‍of other currencies ⁠held in its reserves.\n\nForeign exchange reserves include India's reserve tranche position in the International Monetary Fund.\n\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES (in ⁠million U.S. dollars)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nForeign currency assets 562,885 560,518\n\nReserve Tranche Position 4,703 4,684\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nSource text: (https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx)\n\n((India Headline News ‌Team; +91 80 6749 1310))",
