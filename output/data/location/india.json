    "description": "With the T20 World Cup beginning on Saturday, BBC Sport looks at the trends and tactics from the global game that may play a part in India and Sri Lanka.",
    "fullText": "It may be just 19 months since India lifted the T20 World Cup in Barbados but the latest edition begins in Colombo on Saturday.\n\nAs ever, the tournament in India and Sri Lanka will likely be one of sixes and runs.\n\nBefore it all begins, we have taken a look at what has been going on in international and franchise games over recent years and predicted some trends and tactics to watch out for...\n\nThe option for a team to call in a batter who is struggling and chewing up too many balls has always been there.\n\n2025 was the year retiring batters out hit the mainstream.\n\nThere were 26 instances of that 'dismissal' in international and domestic T20s last year - almost 50% of the total number in the history of the format.\n\nIt has also happened twice more since the turn of the year in the Big Bash, while Northern Districts retired out two batters in the same innings in New Zealand's Super Smash in January.\n\nA batter has retired out in a T20 World Cup before - in a match involving England no less - when Namibia batter Nikolaas Davin walked off to allow David Wiese to come to the middle in the 2024 group stage.\n\nBut with the stigma around the move gone, could this be the tournament of the retired out?\n\nNot since 2013 have spinners bowled as much at the death in T20s as they did in 2025.\n\nFor a long while, the death overs - regarded as the last five in an innings for this data - have been left largely to seamers and their mix of yorkers, slower balls and hard lengths. That is changing.\n\nIn 2025, 24% of balls bowled at the death in T20s between full member nations were delivered by spinners - and with some success.\n\nSpinners' economy rate at the death has dropped around 1.5 runs per over in the past two years to 7.68 runs per over. Last year, spinners had a better economy at the finish than seamers.\n\nAfghanistan, unsurprisingly given the quality of their options, have used spin regularly at the death. More than half of their deliveries in the final five overs were bowled by spinners.\n\nIndia were the next most frequent users of the tactic, followed by Sri Lanka and, interestingly, England.\n\nWhile England captain and when leading Northern Superchargers in The Hundred since 2024, Harry Brook has had spinners bowling 42.2% of his deliveries at the death.\n\nFormer captain Jos Buttler's figure in that time was just 19.7%.\n\nThis may be less of a surprise, given fast scoring and six-hitting has been on an upward trajectory since T20's inception.\n\nLast year was a big jump, however, with batting strike-rates for all players in all men's T20s tipping over 130 for the first time. The increase from 2024 was more than eight runs per 100 balls.\n\nThe introduction of the Indian Premier League's player impact rule has boosted scoring rates there - teams effectively can field an extra batter when needed - but the rise is reflected in internationals too.\n\nA six was also hit every 17.4 deliveries across all T20s last year - the figure was at 23.1 as recently as 2021.\n\nSixes are now hit more than twice as often than in the format's first year in 2003.\n\nWe are all familiar with the term match-up these days.\n\nIt has become commonplace in T20 - and increasingly in Test cricket - and describes how some batters are suited to styles of bowling and vice-versa.\n\nWhen it comes to batting against spin, the logic goes that batters are more vulnerable when facing a bowler who turns the ball away from them - a leg-spinner to right-handers and off-spinner to left-handers.\n\nWhat is interesting, however, is how all of those at the top of the T20 batting rankings, bar Australia's openers Mitchell Marsh and Travis Head as shown below, all have strong records against their perceived negative spin match-up.\n\nIndia's left-handed opener Abhishek Sharma, the world's leading T20 batter, averages 43.3 and strikes at 183.1 runs per 100 balls against off-spin in internationals since the start of 2024.\n\nEngland right-handers Phil Salt and Buttler have strike-rates of 148.4 and 136.8 respectively against left-arm spin alongside solid averages.\n\nThe trend is reflected by the leading spin bowlers too. India's Varun Chakravarthy, Rashid Khan and Adil Rashid all have similar records against right and left-handers.\n\nWhen it gets to the elite level, match-ups are not insignificant but they are not the be all and end all.\n\nAnother thing on the rise is the prevalence of left-handed batters.\n\nIn T20s between full member nations, lefties have never faced a higher percentages of deliveries than the 35% they did in 2025.\n\nThe spike is a sign of some teams switching on to the benefits of right-hand-left-hand batting combinations.\n\nIt makes shorter boundaries harder to defend, messes with bowlers' lengths and negates the threat of those spinning match-ups.\n\nAnd no team uses this more than co-hosts and overwhelming favourites India. It has been a cornerstone of Gautam Gambhir's time as coach.\n\nSince the start of 2024, left-handers have faced 51% of India's deliveries in T20s against full members - a jump from 31% under Rahul Dravid in the run up to the 2024 World Cup.\n\nEngland, in comparison, twice picked a team with only one left-hander in their XI during the tour of India last year.\n\nBut while left-handers only faced 19% of England's deliveries from the start of 2024 to the start of 2026, the selection of Ben Duckett, Jacob Bethell and Sam Curran for this World Cup - all of whom could bat in the top seven - suggests times may, belatedly, be changing.\n\nBut if England are to have any chance in India and Sri Lanka, it feels like Salt and Buttler, their two leading batters, will have to hit form.\n\nAfter Buttler's period at number three, the pair were reunited as openers at the end of last summer and, despite a quiet run for Salt in Sri Lanka, have returned impressive results.\n\nSalt hit scores of 141 not out, 85 and 89 against South Africa and Ireland. Buttler also made 83 against South Africa when an opening stand of 126 sent England on their way to a record 304-2.\n\nSalt, a notoriously aggressive starter, cuts loose from the start, striking at 149.7 in the first two overs of T20s since the start of 2024 - the third best of any opener at this World Cup.\n\nButtler, in comparison, has a strike-rate of just 105 in that time. He sits back and watches Salt do his thing.\n\nBut by the final two overs of the powerplay Buttler is often flying.\n\nThe former captain, having taken a bit of time to get in, has been striking at 172.9 in the fifth and sixth overs, even outdoing Salt's healthy strike-rate of 163.7.\n\nThe pair take on the powerplay in specific and complementary ways.\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "The men's T20 World Cup starts on Saturday against a backdrop of political tension.\n\nThe tournament, which features 20 teams, will be held in India and Sri Lanka.\n\nBangladesh are boycotting it after a request for their fixtures to be switched from India to Sri Lanka was refused by the sport's governing body.\n\nTheir place in Group C has been taken by Scotland.\n\nPakistan had considered boycotting but have since confirmed they will take part, though will not play their scheduled match against India.\n\nBangladesh had asked for their games to be switched from India, citing safety concerns amid growing tensions between the countries.\n\nRelations between the South Asian neighbours have soured since former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India in 2024, following deadly protests.\n\nIndia has not agreed to send her back despite several requests, and violent protests broke out after Sharif Osman Hadi - a prominent student leader in Bangladesh - was shot dead.\n\nIndia itself has raised concerns over violence targeting members of the minority Hindu community in Bangladesh.\n\nIn December, a Hindu man was accused of blasphemy and beaten to death by a mob in an incident that resulted in protests by Hindu nationalist groups in India.\n\nAgainst that political backdrop, Indian Premier League (IPL) side Kolkata Knight Riders released Bangladesh bowler Mustafizur Rahman in January after being instructed to do so by the Board of Control for Cricket in India.\n\nIn response, Bangladeshi authorities banned broadcasts of the IPL in the country.\n\nThe Bangladesh Cricket Board then requested that their World Cup fixtures be played in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe International Cricket Council - the sport's governing body - rejected that request, saying there was an \"absence of any credible security threat\" and gave the BCB a final 24 hours in which to declare their participation.\n\nWhen that deadline passed, Scotland were invited to the tournament.\n\nThe ICC said it was keen not to establish \"precedents that could undermine the neutrality and fairness of ICC events\".\n\nPakistan are boycotting their match against India, which was scheduled to take place in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on 15 February.\n\nIn a statement, the Pakistan government said it granted \"approval\" to the team's participation in the tournament but they \"shall not take to the field\" for the match against India.\n\nPakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi previously said the team could pull out completely after Bangladesh were removed from the tournament.\n\nPakistan and India have not faced each other outside men's major tournaments since 2013, and India have not played in Pakistan since 2008.\n\nPakistan did not host any touring nations between 2009 and 2019 following the Lahore attack on Sri Lanka's team bus, which killed six policemen and two civilians.\n\nPakistani players have also been banned from the IPL since 2009 following the Mumbai attacks that left 174 people - including nine gunmen - dead.\n\nLast year India refused to travel to Pakistan to play in the Champions Trophy and eventually played their matches in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIt resulted in the two nations signing an agreement stating the two countries would play at neutral venues whenever one of them hosts an ICC event.\n\nThe neighbours have fought a number of wars and had several military stand-offs since the partition of India in 1947, when the nation was split into India and the new state of Pakistan. It created an upsurge of violence, in which approximately 15 million people were displaced and an estimated one million died.\n\nRecent escalations were sparked after the neighbours engaged in a four-day military conflict in April 2025 following a deadly militant attack on tourists in India-administered Kashmir.\n\nThe ICC said Pakistan's stance was \"difficult to reconcile\" and called on the country's cricket chiefs to explore a \"mutually acceptable resolution\".\n\nThe governing body said that \"selective participation undermines the spirit and sanctity of the competitions\".\n\nIt said it \"respects the roles of governments in matters of national policy\" but continued: \"This decision is not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide, including millions in Pakistan.\"\n\nIt added it hoped the PCB would \"consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country\".\n\nFormer Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi is among those who have accused the ICC of mishandling the situation.\n\nIn a post on X, he said: \"It's regrettable that Pakistan won't play India, but I stand behind my government's decision.\n\n\"This is the moment for the ICC to lead and prove through decisions, not statements, that it is impartial, independent and fair to every member.\"\n\nMatches between Pakistan and India can draw huge TV audiences.\n\nReportedly, more than 600 million people watched last year's Champions Trophy fixture on Indian streaming platform JioHotstar.\n\nThe ICC has not published its playing conditions for the tournament so it is not known what sanction Pakistan could face.\n\nHowever, the rules for the previous tournament stated: \"If the match is decided by one side conceding defeat or refusing to play, the result shall be stated as match conceded or match awarded, as the case may be.\"\n\nIt is assumed India will be awarded two points for a win and Pakistan's net run-rate will also be hit by the forfeiture.\n\nPakistan face the Netherlands, USA and Namibia in their other group-stage games, and it is unclear what could happen if they were to face India in the final.\n\nTeams have pulled out of tournament fixtures before, with Australia and the West Indies both deciding not to travel to Colombo in the 1996 World Cup that was co-hosted by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.\n\nEngland also decided not to play their 2003 World Cup match against Zimbabwe in Harare, citing security concerns and social unrest in the country.\n\nNone of those nations received a subsequent fine or punishment from the ICC, though all forfeited the matches.\n\nBoth Pakistan and Bangladesh could receive other sanctions as the ICC has a precedent for punishing governments who interfere in the game.\n\nUnder article 2.4 of the ICC constitution, it outlines boards must manage their affairs \"autonomously and ensure that there is no government (or other public or quasi-public body) interference in its governance, regulation and/or administration of cricket\".\n\nIn 2019, Zimbabwe were suspended for three months after the government replaced the cricket board, leading to a freeze on funding and exclusion from World Cup qualifiers.\n\nFour years later, Sri Lanka also lost the right to host the Under-19 World Cup after its government dismissed the national board following poor performances.\n\nBoth nations later had their ICC membership restored.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nICC Men's T20 World Cup - everything you need to know\n\nWho owns the teams competing in The Hundred?\n\nWhat is the 'designated batters' rule introduced by Big Bash League?",

    "fullText": "MUMBAI, Feb 3 (Reuters) - India's financial markets rallied sharply on Tuesday after a trade deal that slashed U.S. tariffs on Indian goods to 18% ​from 50%, a development that investors said lifts a key overhang over the ‌country's stocks, bonds and currency.\n\nIndia's benchmark stock index, the Nifty 50, surged nearly 5%, about 100 points away from ‌its record high hit in January. The rupee climbed over 1% to 90.40 per dollar in early trading. The yield on the country's 10-year benchmark bond declined 5 bps to 6.72%\n\nThe Nifty's rise put it on course for the best one-day gain in five years while the rupee ⁠was on track for its ‌best day since November 2022.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced the deal on social media following a call with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, noting ‍that India had agreed to halt Russian oil purchases and lower trade barriers on U.S. exports.\n\nIndian stock markets and the rupee have been battered since the tariffs were levied by Washington in late August, ​placing them among the worst-performing emerging market assets in 2025, with record foreign investor ‌outflows.\n\nThe trade breakthrough is expected to alleviate the persistent drag, with investors expecting a bounce-back in foreign sentiment and flows into Indian assets.\n\n\"We believe this trade deal announcement should lift a key overhang on Indian equities. Foreign investors who have been net sellers recently might also look to increase their weight to India in light of this announcement,\" said Prashant Paroda, portfolio ⁠manager with AllSpring Global's Intrinsic Emerging Market equities ​team.\n\nThe trade deal is also expected to lift a ​pall of geopolitical uncertainty which had accompanied the U.S.-India trade rift, keeping investors cautious on plowing money into the country.\n\n\"The key tail risk of geopolitical ‍isolation about which investors ⁠were concerned has now been adequately addressed by back-to-back trade deals with the European Union and United States,\" economists at Citi said in a note.\n\nThe breakthrough with the ⁠U.S. comes less than a week after India signed a long-awaited trade deal with the European Union that ‌is expected to eliminate or reduce tariffs on 96.6% of traded goods by ‌value.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Indian stocks and the rupee are set for strong gains on Tuesday after a trade deal that slashes U.S. tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50% in exchange for India halting Russian oil purchases and lowering trade barriers.\n\nHere are some comments from investors and analysts:\n\nRADHIKA RAO, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DBS, ​SINGAPORE:\n\n\"This breakthrough is unmistakably positive for the real economy/exports, sentiment as well as financial markets, while further details are awaited. Textiles, gems & jewellery, engineering goods, leather and chemicals are ‌likely amongst the key gainers.\n\n\"An eventual unveiling of the bilateral trade agreement will provide more details on the beneficiary product lines and trade as well as investment commitments. Domestic markets are expected to witness a relief rally at open, after ‌high tariffs had been one of the key drags on sentiment in the past quarter.\"\n\nCHARU CHANANA, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SAXO, SINGAPORE:\n\n\"This is constructive for Indian equities because it reduces trade policy uncertainty and improves visibility for export-linked earnings - exactly the kind of catalyst that can restart the narrative when global investors have been cautious. But there's a lot we still don't know. If the oil bill rises meaningfully, that can reintroduce inflation and currency sensitivity.\n\n\"The structural story remains strong and the latest budget’s infrastructure and AI push keeps the ‘catch-up’ theme alive. For foreign investors though, the next hurdle is the Indian rupee, which means ⁠the market may look less like a one-way beta trade and ‌more like a dispersion market.\"\n\nMARC VELAN, HEAD OF INVESTMENTS, LUCERNE ASSET MANAGEMENT, SINGAPORE:\n\n\"The trade deal removes a chunk of policy and tariff uncertainty that had been weighing on Indian assets, opening the door for a near-term bounce in the rupee and equities via sentiment and foreign flows, though sustainability will depend ‍on how the deal is implemented rather than the headline itself.\"\n\nTRIDEEP BHATTACHARYA, PRESIDENT & CIO, EQUITIES, EDELWEISS ASSET MANAGEMENT, MUMBAI:\n\n\"The reduction in tariffs from around 50% to ~18% has come in materially better than consensus expectations. When combined with the recently concluded India–EU trade agreement, this potentially represents one of the strongest external growth stimuli for the Indian economy in 2026.\"\n\nLAKSHMAN VENKITARAMAN, ASSOCIATE PORTFOLIO MANAGER, WASTACH GLOBAL, SALT LAKE CITY:\n\n\"We believe the trade deal improves ​investor sentiment toward India. While the U.S. is India’s largest trading partner, exports to the U.S. account for less than 5% of India’s GDP. Nonetheless, U.S.-India trade frictions have weighed on foreign ‌investor perception. This has been compounded by a global trade focused on AI, which has disproportionately benefited markets such as Taiwan and Korea.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - India's government on Sunday handed a major win to Apple by allowing foreign companies to provide machines to their contract manufacturers in certain areas for five years ​without any tax risk.\n\nApple has been growing in India in recent years as it diversifies beyond China. Counterpoint Research ‌says iPhone's share of the Indian market has doubled to 8% since 2022. And while China still accounts for 75% of global iPhone shipments, India's share ‌has quadrupled to 25% since 2022.\n\nWhat is Apple's current market position in India?\n\nWhat tax changes did India make for Apple?\n\nWhy was Apple concerned about India's tax laws?\n\nHow will this benefit Apple's manufacturing strategy?\n\nApple had been lobbying India's government to modify its income tax laws to ensure the company is not taxed for ownership of the high-end iPhone machinery it provides to its contract manufacturers.\n\nIn India, unlike China, Apple was concerned that if it paid for machines for its contract manufacturers, Indian law could consider that a so-called \"business connection\" and impose taxes on its iPhone sales profits. ⁠That had forced its contract manufacturers Foxconn and ‌Tata to themselves spend billions of dollars on machines.\n\nIndia on Sunday said that \"to promote manufacturing of electronic goods for a contract manufacturer\", it is making certain law changes to ensure that mere ownership of ‍machines by a foreign company does not lead to taxes on it.\n\nThe decision was made public as part of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's 2026-27 annual budget, presented on Sunday.\n\nThe move could prompt Apple and other companies to invest rapidly in the electronics manufacturing space by taking over initial ​expenses for pricey machines, reducing the initial cost burden on contract manufacturers they partner with.\n\n\"We are saying that if you bring ‌your machine, and that machine is used by a local manufacturer to produce something, we will ... exempt you for 5 years. We are giving them certainty,\" Revenue Secretary Arvind Shrivastava said at a post-budget press conference.\n\nFASTER SCALE-UP AND GREATER CONFIDENCE\n\nSmartphone manufacturing is a key plank of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's agenda for economic growth.\n\nThe rule change will apply until the 2030-31 tax year and only to factories set up in so-called customs-bonded areas - which are technically considered being outside India’s customs border. If devices are sold within India from ⁠such factories, they will attract import taxes, making such facilities attractive only ​for exports.\n\n\"Any income arising on account of providing capital goods, equipment or tooling ​to a contract manufacturer, being a company resident in India, is eligible for exemption,\" the Indian government said in one of its explanatory budget documents.",

BPCL also signed a term agreement with TotalEnergies for the procurement of UAE crude.\n\nIndian Oil Corp (IOC), the country's largest refiner, last year ​signed a five-year import deal with Trafigura to buy 2.5 million metric tons of LNG ‌in a deal valued at $1.3 billion-$1.4 billion.\n\nIOC's head of marketing, S.P.

    "title": "India–New Zealand FTA: A People-First Pact for a New Era of Trade",
    "description": "India and New Zealand have concluded a landmark free-trade agreement that prioritizes people and services alongside goods.",
    "fullText": "Even as the global trade sector has experienced an Annus Horribilis (horrible year), 2025 has been India’s year of trade acceleration. In July, New Delhi signed the India-UK Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA); in December, it sealed a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with Oman; and now, in a record nine months, India and New Zealand have concluded their free‑trade agreement (FTA), pending legal review and formal ratification.\n\nAlongside early-harvest and launch tracks with the EU, Chile and the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), plus a revived Early Progress Trade Agreement (EPTA) with Canada, a clear picture of India’s new trade architecture is emerging. New Delhi is building high-quality, rules-based bilateral arrangements, phased where necessary, with partners that complement, rather than compete with, India’s strengths and priorities.\n\nOn one level, the India-New Zealand FTA is a straightforward extension of this — a pragmatic deal between two economies whose bilateral trade, while steadily growing, currently stands at a minuscule $2.4 billion, thus leaving plenty of potential to unlock. On the other hand, it tells us something broader about where India is headed and how it intends to build prosperity, with people, not just products, at the center.\n\nFor decades, commentators have reduced India’s trade strategy to a binary: open the gates and risk import surges or stay cautious and forgo the scale and opportunity that the global economic order offers. That false choice collapsed when India refused to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and instead rewired its negotiating posture around complementarity.\n\nThis shift in strategy has been made possible by a wave of internal reforms that reached a new peak in 2025. Major changes, most notably the rollout of Goods and Services Tax (GST) 2.0 this year, alongside other key reforms under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s tenure, including the simplification of foreign direct investment (FDI) norms, expanded production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes, digital governance improvements and the implementation of the Four Labor Codes, have all contributed to investor confidence.\n\nIt is this transformed, future-ready India that now approaches trade negotiations from a position of strength. New Zealand fits that map. It is a high-income, rules-based economy that doesn’t compete head-to-head with India in mass manufacturing; instead, it welcomes Indian services, talent and consumer goods under transparent and fair terms.\n\nThose terms are striking. New Zealand has granted zero-duty access to all Indian exports. Not “most,” not “nearly all” — all. For India’s labor-intensive sectors — textiles and apparel, leather and footwear, gems and jewelry, marine products, toys, handicrafts — this is a once-in-a-generation opening; the kind you build upon to broaden value chains. Small exporters who dreaded duties and nickel-and-diming at the border can now quote with confidence, contract with certainty, ship with speed and expand their operations thanks to cash flows freed from tariffs.\n\nIndia, for its part, has offered tariff liberalization on about 70% of tariff lines, covering 95% of bilateral trade value. This has been done through a calibrated blend of immediate cuts (sheep meat, wool, coal, most forestry and wood), phased reductions (oils, select machinery, wine) and carefully managed tariff-rate quotas for a handful of sensitive horticulture lines (honey, apples, kiwifruit).\n\nBut these concessions have been meticulously crafted to ensure that India’s most sensitive sectors remain protected. Dairy is the most prominent exclusion; it is entirely ring-fenced. The shield extends further: animal products (other than sheep meat), key vegetables, sugar, some oils and strategic nonagricultural sectors such as gems and jewelry, copper and aluminum are all excluded from tariff concessions.\n\nThis is an unmistakable signal that India will write modern, liberal trade rules, but it will do so while securing farmer incomes, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) resilience, and food security. This is not protectionism; it is democratic prioritization for a country where agriculture is a livelihood for millions and not just another sector to be casually bartered away.\n\nThe agreement’s spine, however, is not goods but rather services and mobility. New Zealand’s services commitments are its most ambitious to date, granting Indian firms broad access across IT and IT-enabled services, professional and business services, education, finance, tourism and construction.\n\nCrucially, the agreement includes a Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) clause: if New Zealand offers better terms to another partner in the future, India automatically receives the same benefits. For India’s already globally competitive services sector, this means new opportunities to establish a presence in Oceania, recruit local talent and scale operations in a stable, rules-based environment.\n\nBut the real innovation is the Temporary Employment Entry Visa, a pathway for up to 5,000 Indian professionals at any given time to live and work in New Zealand for up to three years, targeted at skill shortages (IT, engineering, healthcare, education, construction) and specialty roles (yoga instructors, Indian chefs, music teachers). Paired with the fact that the agreement removes numerical caps on Indian students, guarantees 20 hours/week of work during study, and extends post-study work to 3 years for science, technology, engineering and mathematics graduates and 4 years for doctorates, as well as a 1,000-place Working Holiday scheme, and you’ve stitched the “living bridge” of a 300,000-strong Indian diaspora into the economic fabric.\n\nCritics — some inside New Zealand’s politics — have argued that these mobility channels “give too much away.” That is an entirely incorrect framing, though. Global trade today is not a container-ship contest; it is a talent distribution contest. When shortages hobble hospitals, classrooms and infrastructure sites, partnering with a country that supplies trained professionals under transparent, targeted and time-bound rules is not a concession for New Zealand; it is capacity building.\n\nFor India, talent mobility is not brain drain but instead brain circulation. Earnings, networks and know-how will eventually come home, while remittances in the interim can help stabilize families. Far from “giving away” jobs, this agreement allows New Zealand to fill gaps that its own workforce cannot meet. At the same time, the pathways it opens enable Indian professionals to gain global experience and return with skills that strengthen India’s economy — further enhancing India’s international reputation as a source of reliable, high-quality talent.\n\nThe FTA also does the dull yet decisive things right. Customs modernization commits India to 48-hour release windows at the border. That single clause can save exporters more money than many tariff cuts, because time itself can act as a shadow tariff. The pact hardwires cooperation on standards and sanitary rules and creates Agri-Technology Action Plans for kiwifruit, apples and honey. These plans mean both countries will collaborate on sharing best practices — needless to say, India will be the beneficiary.\n\nAdditionally, the agreement requires New Zealand to update its Geographical Indications (GI) framework, thereby granting India the same rights as the EU to register wines, spirits and other goods, ensuring full parity in GI protection. Regulatory access for pharmaceuticals, medical devices and organic products has also been streamlined, reducing duplication and accelerating approvals.\n\nThere is also long-term capital behind this agreement: New Zealand has pledged $ 20 billion in investment in India over the next 15 years. The scale of this commitment signals confidence in India’s economic trajectory and its potential as a global growth engine. The agreement also includes a rebalancing clause that allows India to take remedial measures if the delivery of investments falls short of its commitments. India has learned that FTAs without real capital and capability often disappoint; this one addresses both, the kind of long-term backbone that many earlier agreements lacked.\n\nOf course, no agreement is without its challenges. The FTA will require careful implementation and timely ratification, efficient visa processing, and real delivery on its various Agri-tech and customs commitments.\n\nBut from an Indian perspective, the fundamentals are solid: the deal is structured to maximize opportunity while safeguarding core interests. It is precisely the template India should look to replicate — combining asymmetric access to goods that favors MSMEs with ambitious services and talent mobility. It is bilateralism that looks beyond tariffs, focusing instead on people, productivity and a true sense of partnership.\n\nIndia’s new trade architecture is not merely about opening doors but about building bridges among economies, nations and, above all, people. In that vein, the India-New Zealand FTA is a blueprint for how the next decade of Indian trade can and should be built.\n\n[Kaitlyn Diana edited this piece.]\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Fair Observer’s editorial policy.\n\nWe rely on your support for our independence, diversity and quality.\n\nFor more than 10 years, Fair Observer has been free, fair and independent.

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI/BRUSSELS, Jan 25 (Reuters) - India plans to slash tariffs on cars imported from the European Union to 40% from as high as 110%, sources said, in the biggest opening yet of the country's vast ​market as the two sides close in on a free trade pact that could come as early as Tuesday.\n\nPrime Minister ‌Narendra Modi's government has agreed to immediately reduce the tax on a limited number of cars from the 27-nation bloc with an import price of more than 15,000 euros ($17,739), ‌two sources briefed on the talks told Reuters.\n\nThis will be further lowered to 10% over time, they added, easing access to the Indian market for European automakers such as Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and BMW.\n\nThe sources declined to be identified as the talks are confidential and could be subject to last-minute changes. India's commerce ministry and the European Commission declined to comment.\n\nPACT ALREADY DUBBED 'MOTHER OF ALL DEALS'\n\nIndia and the EU are expected to announce on Tuesday the ⁠conclusion of protracted negotiations for the free trade ‌pact, after which the two sides will finalise the details and ratify what is being called \"the mother of all deals.\n\nThe pact could expand bilateral trade and lift Indian exports of goods such as textiles and jewellery, which ‍have been hit by 50% U.S. tariffs since late August.\n\nIndia is the world's third-largest car market by sales after the U.S. and China, but its domestic auto industry has been one of the most protected. New Delhi currently levies tariffs of 70% and 110% on imported cars, a level often criticised by executives, ​including Tesla chief Elon Musk.\n\nNew Delhi has proposed slashing import duties to 40% immediately for about 200,000 combustion-engine cars a year, one ‌of the sources said, its most aggressive move yet to open up the sector. This quota could be subject to last-minute changes, the source added.\n\nBattery electric vehicles will be excluded from import duty reductions for the first five years to protect investments by domestic players like Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors in the nascent sector, the two sources said. After five years EVs will follow similar duty cuts.\n\nMARKET CURRENTLY DOMINATED BY SUZUKI AND LOCAL MAKERS\n\nLower import taxes will be a boost for European automakers such as Volkswagen, Renault and Stellantis, as well as luxury players ⁠Mercedes-Benz and BMW which locally manufacture cars in India but have struggled to grow ​beyond a point in part due to high tariffs.\n\nLower taxes will allow carmakers to ​sell imported vehicles for a cheaper price and test the market with a broader portfolio before committing to manufacturing more cars locally, said one of the two sources.",

What is needed is a bold, focused and cohesive strategy to drive transformative change,\" according to a government official involved in drafting the policy.\n\nMODEST FUNDING ⁠TO BE DECIDED BY GOVERNMENT PANEL\n\nThe government will ‌spend about 100 billion rupees ($1 billion) to build infrastructure for about 30 manufacturing hubs across the targeted sectors while providing grants of $218 million for advanced areas such as chips and energy storage, said ‍the officials, who asked not to be named because they were not authorised to speak to media.\n\nThe Finance Ministry and government think tank NITI Aayog, which is tasked with preparing the policy, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nFunding this time is modest as the plan focuses on easing ​regulatory and compliance burdens, the biggest impediment to Indian manufacturing, rather than doling out subsidies, the officials said.\n\nFinancial support to ‌industries will be decided case by case with recommendations from a new government panel to administrative departments, replacing the pre-budget fiscal packages of earlier schemes, they said.\n\nThe new structure, called the National Manufacturing Mission, was announced in the budget last year but details were not disclosed. Details could be announced in the budget on February 1, but that will be decided closer to the date, the officials said.\n\nThe panel's focus will be to ensure faster regulatory clearance, approvals for land and cheaper financing for ⁠large projects, the officials said. It will be chaired by a minister ​and composed of bureaucrats, including the cabinet secretary, they said.\n\nIt will oversee the ​building of manufacturing hubs for the 15 sectors, and work with state governments to assure steady and cheap electricity supplies for such units, the sources said.",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW, Jan 23 (Reuters) - China is set to ramp up imports of Russian oil in January, absorbing barrels that would have previously gone to India ​and Turkey, as tougher Western sanctions force Moscow to redirect flows, LSEG data ‌and traders said.\n\nThe United States and the European Union imposed sweeping sanctions in late 2025 targeting Russian oil ‌sellers and shippers, including energy giants Rosneft and Lukoil, complicating purchases for global buyers and tightening scrutiny on Russian crude exports.\n\nChina is poised to receive nearly 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of Russian oil by sea this month, compared with 1.1 million bpd in December, according to ⁠preliminary LSEG data. Beijing, already ‌a key consumer of Russian Far East ESPO Blend, also boosted imports of Russian Urals oil to a record high of 405,000 bpd ‍in January, the highest since mid-2023, data provided by energy consultancy Kpler showed.\n\nIndia, previously the largest buyer of Russian Urals by sea since the EU embargo on Moscow's oil in 2022, slashed purchases ​to below 1 million bpd in December, down from an average of 1.3 million ‌bpd last year, LSEG data showed. Indian refiners are expected to keep Russian oil imports near 1 million bpd in January as they diversify supply sources.\n\nTurkey, also a major Russian oil buyer, reduced Urals imports in January to about 250,000 bpd, compared to an average of 275,000 bpd in 2025 and well below the record 400,000 bpd reached in June ⁠last year.\n\n\"As Indian and Turkish buyers cut purchases ​recently, some Russian Urals cargoes headed for China,\" said ​a trader involved in Russian oil sales. He added that the surplus of Urals barrels weighed on prices.\n\nDiscounts for Urals crude delivered to China ‍in late 2025 widened ⁠to as much as $12 per barrel below ICE Brent for some cargoes, while current Urals differentials hover near minus $10 to the benchmark, according to two traders active ⁠in the Asian market.\n\nDemand for Urals in India and Turkey, both major exporters of diesel to Europe, slumped ‌due to the EU ban on fuels produced from Russian-origin crude, the ‌traders added.",

    "fullText": "Pirate sites and services can be a real challenge for rightsholders to deal with. In India, however, recent court orders have proven to be quite effective.\n\nIndian courts have issued pirate site blocking orders for over a decade. Initially, these orders were relatively basic, requiring local Internet providers to block specific domain names.\n\nThese regular injunctions were only partially effective. After the High Court granted a blocking injunction, pirate sites would often switch to new domains, requiring rightsholders to return to court to get these blocked as well.\n\nTo deal with this problem, the dynamic injunction was invented. These orders were issued to more effectively deny access to content made available on pirate sites. ISPs were not only required to block original domains but also any clones and mirror sites that surfaced after the order was signed.\n\nWhen dynamic injunctions were no longer sufficient to slay the piracy hydra, rightsholders suggested upgrading the Indian blocking regime with Dynamic ++ injunctions. These orders also protect copyrighted content that has yet to be registered.\n\nIn addition, Dynamic++ orders and their ‘superlative‘ variant also include domain name registrars as defendants. This includes blocking orders targeted at U.S. domain registrars.\n\nThe ability to target domain name registrants proved to be a game changer. Over the past two years, it allowed rightsholders to disable domains of various prominent pirate sites, some with dozens of millions of visitors. While these sites could simply register new domains, the legal efforts certainly affected their operation.\n\nFor this reason, it is no surprise to see that several American movie industry players have ramped up their enforcement actions in India, targeting hundreds of domains at a time. And since these orders effectively suspend domains at various domain name registrars, new requests keep coming in.\n\nAs reported by Verdictum a few days ago, the High Court in New Delhi issued a new blocking injunction on December 18, targeting more than 150 pirate site domains, including yflix.to, animesuge.bz, bs.to, and many others.\n\nThe complaint is filed by Warner Bros., Apple, Crunchyroll, Disney, and Netflix, which are all connected to the MPA’s anti-piracy arm, ACE. The referenced works include some of the most pirated titles, such as Stranger Things, Squid Game, and Silo.\n\nIn addition to targeting Indian ISPs, the order also lists various domain name registries and related organizations as defendants. This includes American registrars such as Namecheap and GoDaddy, but also the government of the Kingdom of Tonga, which is linked to .to domains.\n\nIn addition to suspending the domain names within three days days, the domain name registrars are given four weeks to disclose the relevant subscriber information connected to these domains.\n\n“[The registrars] shall lock and suspend Defendant Nos. 1 to 47 websites within 72 hours of being communicated with a copy of this Order and shall file all the Basic Subscriber Information, including the name, address, contact information, email addresses, bank details, IP logs, and any other relevant information […] within four weeks of being communicated with a copy of this Order,” the High Court wrote.\n\nWhile the “Dynamic+” injunction is designed to be a global kill switch, its effectiveness depends entirely on the cooperation of the domain name registrars. Since most of these are based outside of India, their compliance is not guaranteed.\n\nAccording to our analysis, it appears that most domain names have not been suspended. These pirate sites domains continue to be accessible today. Some continue running from their original domains, while others redirect to new ones, suggesting that they remain controlling their original owners.\n\nThis includes domains that are linked to Namecheap, Tucows, GoDaddy, NameSilo, Dynadot, OVH and others. The government of the Kingdom of Tonga did not comply with the Indian court order either.\n\nAs far as we can see, domains linked to the American registrar Porkbun, the UK-based WHG Hosting services, and the Lithuanian registrar Hostinger were fully suspended. Registrar.eu also put some domains on clientHold, and the one that remains accessible (animesuge.bz) is linked to Namecheap now.\n\nIt’s not unprecedented for foreign companies, including American ones, not to comply with Indian court orders. However, in this case, it is worth noting that Namecheap previously appeared to comply with similar orders from the Delhi High Court.\n\nThe non-compliance must come as a disappointment to Netflix, Warner Bros. and the others. However, they will likely be back in court for more blocking and suspension orders soon enough.\n\nAll in all, it is clear that India’s High Court has a streamlined process in place that effectively orders local ISPs to block pirate sites. However, the intended global reach seems to be restricted to a few registrars, for now.\n\nA copy of the High Court order, issued on December 18, 2025, by Justice Tejas Karia, is available here (pdf). The court order includes 163 unique domain names, some of which are not linked to a registrar. An overview of the 125 domains that are linked to targeted registrars and related entities is provided below. .",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 23 (Reuters) - India can leverage its growing energy demand to negotiate better oil and gas ​supply deals, Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Friday, ‌as its refiners continue seeking alternatives to Russian oil.\n\nIndia became the top buyer of discounted ‌Russian seaborne crude after Moscow's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, but challenges posed by Western sanctions eventually prompted Indian refiners to increase imports from other sources.\n\nIndian officials have been careful to avoid directly referencing Russian oil ⁠imports, but Puri said ‌supplies from \"one source\" that had surged after February 2022, were now easing.\n\nData obtained from trade sources showed India's Russian ‍oil imports fell to their lowest level in two years in December, lifting OPEC's share of imports to an 11-month high.\n\nIndia's rising oil demand gives it \"a ​little bit of positioning inside the world\" to negotiate better deals, ‌Puri said.\n\nThe world's third-largest oil importer and consumer should have no trouble covering its needs given ample global supplies and rising output in countries such as Brazil, Guyana, Suriname and the United States.\n\nIndian refiners have been buying more oil from Middle Eastern, African and South American ⁠countries to make up for a drop ​in Russian oil imports, which is expected ​to help India negotiate a tariff deal with Washington.\n\nPuri said Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd had doubled the size of its ‍annual contract with ⁠Brazil's Petrobras.\n\nIndian Oil Corp, the country's top refiner, has bought 7 million barrels of oil, including from Brazil's Petrobras, for March ⁠loading to replace Russian oil, trade sources said.\n\nIOC last month bought its first Colombian ‌oil and for the first time bought Ecuadorean Oriente crude.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Nidhi VermaEditing by Tomasz Janowski)",

    "fullText": "While the US military has pursued ambitious technological advances, manpower remains one of its core pillars.\n\nFrom high-ranking generals to soldiers on the field, human troops remain a key way to assess the reach and power of the world's militaries.\n\nUsing data from the International Institute for Strategic Studies' 2025 Military Balance report, Business Insider ranked countries by the size of their active armed forces and listed their defense budgets, based on 2024 figures.\n\nActive-duty force size is a tally of a country's uniformed troops: airmen, soldiers, sailors, special operators, and Marines. Armies, in particular, depend on size to gain and occupy ground. Militaries can also be a tool of domestic repression, a focus that undercuts its capabilities against an external foe. North Korea, for example, is one of the world's most repressive states, led by a dictator who has repeatedly threatened neighboring South Korea.\n\nThe number of active-duty military personnel is far from the only factor that matters when comparing military power between countries, but it shows latent power that could be augmented via conscription and calling up reservists.\n\n\"Numbers have value, but there's a lot more to military capability,\" said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, DC-based foreign policy and national security think tank.\n\nIISS, a London-headquartered think tank, counts active armed forces, reservists, and paramilitaries as separate categories in its analysis, showing a fuller picture of each nation's manpower.\n\nSome countries have significantly higher numbers of reservists than others — Vietnam has the largest number in the world, estimated at 5 million.\n\nBut while reservists can aid militaries when needed, the quality and longevity of their expertise can vary between conscription- and volunteer-based systems, Cancian told Business Insider.\n\n\"When you look at some countries' reserve numbers, you're often looking at people who haven't trained in 10 or 20 years,\" he said. \"It gives you a big number, but their military value is questionable.\"\n\nAnd while paramilitaries can be effective at enforcing internal security and party strength, Cancian says that \"as a military force, they have essentially zero value.\"\n\nEven when accounting for all of a military's manpower, personnel is only one of the various factors that can qualify a nation's military strength, which also include equipment and readiness.\n\nThere's also the role of technologies in global warfare, the size and sophistication of air forces and naval fleets, amphibious capabilities to land assault forces, command and control systems, or nuclear forces, which all shape military power. Larger and more advanced forces require higher state expenditures.\n\nStill, comparing global manpower offers insight into how countries prioritize military power.\n\nSee how the world's largest militaries stack up.",

    "title": "What is Nipah virus? Symptoms to watch out for as India races to contain deadly outbreak",
    "description": "Nipah is a deadly virus with no vaccine or cure and considered a high-risk pathogen by the World Health Organization",
    "fullText": "India is moving quickly to contain a Nipah virus outbreak in the eastern state of West Bengal after five cases were confirmed, including doctors and nurses who were infected.\n\nNearly 100 people have been asked to quarantine at home, and infected patients were being treated in hospitals in and around the capital Kolkata, according to local media reports, with one patient in a critical condition.\n\nNipah is a deadly virus with no vaccine or cure and is considered a high-risk pathogen by the World Health Organization. Experts say human infections are rare and usually occur when the virus spills over from bats, often through contaminated fruit.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this virus:\n\nNipah virus (NiV) infection most often begins with non-specific symptoms, making early detection difficult.\n\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the incubation period is generally believed to range from four to 21 days, though longer delays between exposure and illness have been reported in rare cases during previous outbreaks.\n\nPatients typically develop a sudden flu-like illness marked by fever, headache, muscle pain and fatigue. In some cases, respiratory symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath or pneumonia also occur, although the timing and severity of these symptoms can vary widely.\n\nThe most serious and defining complication of Nipah infection is inflammation of the brain, known as encephalitis. Neurological symptoms, including confusion, altered consciousness, seizures or coma, usually appear several days to weeks after the initial onset of illness.\n\nSome patients may also develop meningitis.\n\nNipah virus is associated with a high death rate, with fatality levels reported between 40 and 75 per cent depending on the outbreak and the viral strain involved.\n\nSurvivors may experience long-term neurological effects, such as persistent seizures or changes in personality, according to the UK Health Security Agency’s update.\n\nIn rare cases, encephalitis has been reported to recur months or even years after the initial infection, either due to relapse or reactivation of the virus.\n\nNipah virus is a zoonotic pathogen that can be transmitted from animals to humans and from person to person, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe primary natural carriers are fruit bats (Pteropus species); humans can become infected through direct contact with infected bats or other animals, or by consuming food contaminated with bat saliva, urine or faeces.\n\nHuman‑to‑human transmission has also been reported, particularly through close contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.\n\nNipah virus (NiV) was first identified in 1999 after an outbreak of encephalitis and respiratory illness among pig farmers and others who had close contact with infected pigs in Malaysia and Singapore. The episode led to the recognition of NiV as a serious zoonotic pathogen capable of crossing from animals to humans.\n\nSince then, repeated outbreaks have been recorded in South Asia. Parts of northeast India and several districts in Bangladesh have reported cases, with Bangladesh experiencing outbreaks almost every year since 2001.\n\nIn southern India, the state of Kerala reported its first Nipah outbreak in 2018, followed by sporadic cases in subsequent years.\n\nBeyond South Asia, infections have also been reported in the Philippines, with investigations suggesting they were caused by the Nipah virus or a closely related Nipah-like strain.\n\nScientific studies have identified fruit bats as the natural reservoir of the virus. Nipah virus has been isolated from bat urine in Malaysia, and antibodies have been detected in at least 23 bat species across Asia as well as in parts of Africa, including Ghana and Madagascar.\n\nDespite this wide animal reservoir, confirmed human outbreaks have so far been limited to South and Southeast Asia, typically occurring in rural or semi-rural settings where contact between humans, bats and domestic animals is more likely, WHO says.\n\n“Human-to-human transmission of Nipah virus has also been reported among family and caregivers of infected patients,” according to WHO.\n\nThere is currently no proven, targeted treatment for Nipah virus (NiV) infection and no approved vaccine to prevent it.\n\nCare for patients remains largely supportive, focusing on managing symptoms and complications as they arise.\n\nThe virus is listed by the WHO as a priority pathogen under its Research and Development Blueprint, which identifies epidemic threats that require urgent research.\n\nFollow these essential precautions to prevent Nipah Virus infection. Stay alert, stay informed, and follow advisories issued by local health authorities.#NipahVirus #PublicHealth #HealthForAll pic.twitter.com/itTuZA18ev\n\n— Ministry of Health (@MoHFW_INDIA) January 22, 2026\n\nWith no vaccine available, preventing Nipah virus infection relies on awareness and simple protective measures, global health agencies recommend. Public health advice focuses on reducing contact with the virus, whether from bats, animals, or infected people.\n\nPreventing bat-to-human transmission: Bats are the main carriers of Nipah. People should avoid consuming raw date palm sap or fruits that might have been contaminated by bats, WHO guidelines advise.\n\nBoiling fresh date palm juice and thoroughly washing or peeling fruits can reduce risk. Any fruit showing signs of bat bites should be discarded, the health agency advises.\n\nPreventing animal-to-human transmission: People handling sick animals, their tissues, or during slaughter should wear gloves and protective clothing. Contact with infected pigs should be minimised, and pig farms in areas with fruit bats should take steps to protect feed and enclosures from bats.\n\nSymptoms of Nipah Virus in humans can range from fever and headache to respiratory distress and neurological complications.\nEarly recognition of these symptoms and timely medical care are critical to reducing severity and preventing complications.#NipahVirus #HealthAwareness… pic.twitter.com/odW9baGomD\n\n— Ministry of Health (@MoHFW_INDIA) January 20, 2026\n\nPreventing human-to-human transmission: Avoid close, unprotected contact with people infected with Nipah. Regular hand washing after caring for or visiting sick individuals is essential to stop the virus from spreading.\n\nThe 2011 film Contagion, which depicts a fast-spreading global virus, was partly inspired by real-life pathogens like the Nipah virus, a bat-borne virus first identified in Malaysia in 1999, according to global health non-profit Path’s website.\n\nNipah causes severe respiratory illness and brain inflammation (encephalitis) and can spread from animals to humans, contaminated food, or infected people.\n\nIts high fatality rate, potential for outbreaks, and lack of a vaccine made it a model for how a zoonotic virus could trigger a pandemic, which filmmakers used to shape the realistic global crisis in Contagion, Path noted.",

    "fullText": "MUMBAI/NEW DELHI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - India's central bank has proposed that BRICS countries link their official digital currencies to make cross-border trade and tourism payments easier, two sources said, which could reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar as geopolitical tensions rise.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recommended ​to the government that a proposal connecting the central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) be included on the agenda for the 2026 BRICS summit, the sources said. They requested ‌anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly.\n\nIndia will host the summit, which will be held later this year. If the recommendation is accepted, a proposal to link the digital currencies of BRICS members would be put ‌forward for the first time. The BRICS organisation includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, among others.\n\nThe initiative could irritate the U.S., which has warned against any moves to bypass the dollar.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has previously said the BRICS alliance is \"anti-American\" and he threatened to impose tariffs on its members.\n\nThe RBI, India's central government and the central banks of China, Brazil, and Russia did not respond to emails seeking comment. The South African central bank declined to comment.\n\nThe RBI's proposal to link BRICS' CBDCs for cross-border trade finance and tourism has not been previously reported.\n\nThe ⁠RBI's proposal builds on a 2025 declaration at a BRICS summit ‌in Rio de Janeiro, which pushed for interoperability between members' payment systems to make cross-border transactions more efficient.\n\nThe RBI has publicly expressed interest in linking India's digital rupee with other nations' CBDCs to expedite cross-border transactions and bolster its currency's global usage. It has, however, said its efforts ‍to promote the rupee's global use are not aimed at promoting de-dollarisation.\n\nWhile none of the BRICS members have fully launched their digital currencies, all five main members have been running pilot projects.\n\nIndia's digital currency - called the e-rupee - has attracted a total of 7 million retail users since its launch in December 2022, while China has pledged to boost the international use of the digital yuan.\n\nThe RBI has encouraged the adoption ​of the e-rupee by enabling offline payments, providing programmability for government subsidy transfers and by allowing fintech firms to offer digital currency wallets.\n\nFor the BRICS digital currency linkages to ‌be successful, elements like interoperable technology, governance rules and ways to settle imbalanced trade volumes would be among the discussion topics, one of the sources said.",

    "description": ": Revenue growth is sluggish, too",
    "fullText": "India’s big four outsourcers – HCL, Infosys, TCS and Wipro – have essentially stopped hiring, perhaps coinciding with their increased use of AI to power their practices.\n\nThe four companies have all announced quarterly results in the last ten days and appear to be in decent health. HCL reported $3.8 billion revenue, up 7.4 percent year over year. Infosys pulled in $5.1 billion, up 1.7 percent year over year. TCS revenue of $7.5 billion represented a three percent increase. Wipro’s $2.6 billion revenue represented a 5.5 percent year over year improvement.\n\nIndia’s top tech companies often hire more than 10,000 people a quarter, a rate of recruitment that more-than offsets attrition and sees their headcounts rise substantially. Wipro increased its payroll by 6,500 people last quarter and Infosys hired 5,000 more – muted growth by their standards – while TCS and HCL went backward by 11,000 and 261 people respectively.\n\nOver the last year, the four companies added just 3,910 staff, an unusually slow rate of hiring.\n\nPerhaps coincidentally, all four companies told investors they’re using more AI to deliver services for clients, either by adopting the technology to streamline their own work or by adding it to the tools they deliver to customers. Infosys has gone meta with its efforts, by creating a tool that uses AI to create Global Capability Centers, the company’s term for offshored and/or outsourced operations it runs for clients in India, that use AI to improve customers’ operations.\n\nAll also report that clients are hungry for AI expertise, so they can put the technology to work streamlining their operations. As you would expect, on earnings calls the outsourcers’ execs reached for metrics to describe their success with AI. For HCL that was pointing to 60 of its priority customers adopting one of its AI services. At TCS, the trophy win was using AI to accelerate the pace of software builds for a major client. Wipro is chuffed about the rate of adoption for its AI-infused operations tools WINGS and WEGA.\n\nThe four companies are all hiring people with AI skills as fast as they can find them while also training senior staff who are yet to wrap their heads around the tech, a new twist on the services industry’s balancing act of trying to keep margins high by having inexperienced and low-salaried juniors handle much client work after high-cost seniors lead with consultancy.\n\nInvestors weren’t spooked by what they heard, with the four companies’ share prices steady – other than Infosys, which popped five percent. ®",

    "description": "India issues a final warning to Apple in its antitrust case, signaling action after delays over App Store practices.",
    "fullText": "India’s competition watchdog has issued a final warning to Apple in a long-running antitrust case. After more than a year of back-and-forth, the regulator says Apple’s repeated requests for more time are blocking the process.\n\nThe investigation began after a 2022 complaint from Match, the owner of Tinder, and several Indian startups. Regulators later concluded that Apple abused its position in the iOS app market. They then asked Apple to submit objections and share financial data needed to assess penalties.\n\nSince then, the case has stalled. Apple has sought multiple extensions and challenged how any fine would be calculated. As a result, the dispute has remained stuck in legal review.\n\nThe commission noted that it asked Apple in October 2024 to respond to the findings and provide key financial details. However, Apple kept asking for more time. The order states that this cannot continue and warns that the case will move forward even without Apple’s reply.\n\nApple says it could face a fine of up to $38 billion if regulators base penalties on its global revenue. Because of this, the company has challenged the penalty rules in court and asked to pause the antitrust case until judges rule on that issue.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Apple plans to wait for the next court hearing on January 27 before responding. A source familiar with the matter said Apple views the regulator’s move as an attempt to preempt the court process.\n\nIf Apple does not submit its response by the deadline set by the commission, the regulator says it will proceed on its own. That would bring the long-running dispute closer to a decision, even as Apple continues its legal challenge in court.",

    "fullText": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship and Bare Knuckle Fight League are making their official entry into India, marking a significant expansion into one of the world’s largest combat sports markets.\n\nThe move is being spearheaded by World League of Fighters, BKFC’s license holder, which is co-founded by Rajesh Banga, Sunil Mathew and Siraj Gill. The organization has brought in prominent film producer Parag Sanghvi and Bollywood star and martial artist Tiger Shroff to join the board alongside BKFC founder and president David Feldman and former two-division UFC champion Conor McGregor, who became a part-owner of BFKC in 2024.\n\nMiss Universe Harnaaz Sandhu Joins Tiger Shroff, Sanjay Dutt in 'Baaghi 4' - Global Bulletin\n\nNetflix, Amazon Prime, ZEE5, SonyLIV Vie for India's IFFI Streaming Honor - Global Bulletin\n\nFox Orders Lifeguard Drama Series 'Rescue: Hi-Surf' from Producer John Wells (TV News Roundup)\n\nWLF previously delivered a sold-out BKFC event in Dubai last year, which the organization describes as the biggest bare-knuckle fighting event held in the Middle East.\n\nThe India expansion will introduce a team-based bare-knuckle league format – marking the first time such a structure has been implemented in the history of the sport. The format will feature six inaugural teams: Crushers, Punishers, Warriors, Phantoms, Gladiators and Infernos, transforming individual fights into a franchise-based competition.\n\nRahul Saxena has been appointed CEO to lead the platform. He brings experience in scaling global brands to the role.\n\n“India is not just a market – it is the future of global combat sports,” Banga, Mathew and Gill said in a joint statement. “Together with BKFC, BKFL and WLF, we are building an ecosystem that will develop Indian fighters, create global stars and deliver world-class fight entertainment to millions of fans.”\n\nSanghvi positioned the venture as an opportunity to build a sports intellectual property from India with global reach. “This is where world-class storytelling meets raw, uncompromising sport,” he said. “With WLF, BKFC and Conor McGregor, we are not just launching a league – we are architecting a global sports IP from India that will command attention, talent and fandom worldwide.”\n\nFeldman emphasized India’s longstanding position in the organization’s expansion strategy. “India has been on our roadmap for a long time,” he said. “The scale, the energy, the culture — there is no place like it. With the leadership team we have assembled and our partnership with WLF, we are bringing the purest form of combat sports to a nation ready for it.”\n\nMcGregor, who serves as a global partner for BKFC, framed the expansion as transformative. “India has warriors in its DNA,” he said. “What we’re building with BKFC and BKFL in India will be something the world has never seen before. This is not just expansion – this is a revolution.”\n\nShroff, joining McGregor as a board member, highlighted the cultural significance of the venture. “Honored to stand alongside Conor McGregor as we create something truly historic for Indian sport,” he said. “This is more than a fight – it’s a global movement, and history is being written. Just like cinema, sport is a celebration of talent and skill, and Parag [Sanghvi] and I are committed to turning this into a landmark moment for India.”\n\nThe first official BKFC and BKFL team-based events are scheduled for 2026, with venue and fight card details to be announced.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nOscar Predictions: Original Screenplay — With Few Signals, 'Sinners' Takes an Early Lead\n\nOscar Predictions: ‘Sinners’ Could Shatter the All-Time Nomination Record as International Films Hope for Recognition\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week",

That’s what actually gets him into the zone. People outside think Virat is arrogant, but he is not. He gets into the zone.”\n\n“His attitude is amazing. His work ethics are amazing. He always wants to change, improve, and contribute for the team,” Rahane said.\n\nVirat Kohli’s career has been defined by the level of effort, commitment, and focus he has brought to every team and every format of the game.\n\nKohli’s focus has been a talking point among fans and critics for years, but teammates have often described it as a key part of his success.\n\nNow playing only limited-overs cricket, Kohli recently became the second-highest run-scorer in international history, with 28,068 runs, following a 93-run innings against New Zealand.\n\nRahane’s comments echo what many within the Indian setup have said before: Kohli’s intensity is often misread, but it’s that same approach that has helped him build one of the most impressive careers in modern cricket.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 11 (Reuters) - India proposes requiring smartphone makers to share source code with the government and make several software changes as part of a raft of security measures, prompting behind-the-scenes opposition from giants like Apple and Samsung.\n\nThe tech companies ​have countered that the package of 83 security standards, which would also include a requirement to alert the government to major software updates, ‌lacks any global precedent and risks revealing proprietary details, according to four people familiar with the discussions and a Reuters review of confidential government and industry documents.\n\nThe plan is part of Prime Minister Narendra ‌Modi's efforts to boost security of user data as online fraud and data breaches increase in the world's second-largest smartphone market, with nearly 750 million phones.\n\nIT Secretary S. Krishnan told Reuters that \"any legitimate concerns of the industry will be addressed with an open mind\", adding it was \"premature to read more into it\". A ministry spokesperson said it could not comment further due to ongoing consultation with tech companies on the proposals.\n\nONGOING TUG OF WAR OVER GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS\n\nApple, South Korea's Samsung, Google, China's Xiaomi and MAIT, the Indian ⁠industry group that represents the firms, did not respond ‌to requests for comment.\n\nIndian government requirements have irked technology firms before. Last month it revoked an order mandating a state-run cyber safety app on phones amid concerns over surveillance. But the government brushed aside lobbying last year and required rigorous testing for security ‍cameras over fears of Chinese spying.\n\nXiaomi and Samsung - whose phones use Google's Android operating system - hold 19% and 15%, respectively, of India's market share and Apple 5%, Counterpoint Research estimates.\n\nAmong the most sensitive requirements in the new Indian Telecom Security Assurance Requirements is access to source code - the underlying programming instructions that make phones work. This would be analysed and possibly ​tested at designated Indian labs, the documents show.\n\nThe Indian proposals also require companies to make software changes to allow pre-installed apps to be uninstalled and to ‌block apps from using cameras and microphones in the background to \"avoid malicious usage\".\n\n\"Industry raised concerns that globally security requirement have not been mandated by any country,\" said a December IT ministry document detailing meetings that officials held with Apple, Samsung, Google and Xiaomi.\n\nThe security standards, drafted in 2023, are in the spotlight now as the government is considering imposing them legally. IT ministry and tech executives are due to meet on Tuesday for more discussions, sources said.\n\nCOMPANIES SAY SOURCE CODE REVIEW, ANALYSIS 'NOT POSSIBLE'\n\nSmartphone makers closely guard their source code. Apple declined China's request for source code between 2014 and 2016, and U.S. law enforcement has also tried and failed to ⁠get it.\n\nIndia's proposals for \"vulnerability analysis\" and \"source code review\" would require smartphone makers to perform a \"complete ​security assessment\", after which test labs in India could check their claims through source code review and ​analysis.\n\n\"This is not possible ... due to secrecy and privacy,\" MAIT said in a confidential document drafted in response to the government proposal, and seen by Reuters. \"Major countries in the EU, North America, Australia and Africa do not mandate these requirements.\"\n\nMAIT asked the ministry last ‍week to drop the proposal, a source ⁠with direct knowledge said.\n\nThe Indian proposals would mandate automatic and periodic malware scanning on phones. Device makers would also have to inform the National Centre for Communication Security about major software updates and security patches before releasing them to users, and the centre would have the right to test them.\n\nMAIT's ⁠document says regular malware scanning significantly drains a phone's battery and seeking government approval for software updates is \"impractical\" as they need to be issued promptly.\n\nIndia also wants the phone's logs - digital records ‌of its system activity - to be stored for at least 12 months on the device.\n\n\"There is not enough room on device to store ‌1-year log events,\" MAIT said in the document.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Below are key security requirements India is proposing for smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung, prompting ​opposition from tech companies, according to four sources, as well as industry and government ‌documents seen by Reuters.\n\nManufacturers must test and provide proprietary source code for review by government-designated labs to ‌identify vulnerabilities in phone operating systems that could be exploited by attackers.\n\nIndustry group MAIT, which represents Apple, South Korea's Samsung, Google, China's Xiaomi, has told the government this is \"not possible\" due to corporate secrecy and global privacy policies.\n\nBACKGROUND PERMISSION RESTRICTIONS:\n\nApps cannot access cameras, microphones or location services in ⁠the background when phones are inactive. ‌Continuous status bar notifications are required when these permissions are active.\n\nManufacturers say this lacks any global precedent and there is no specific test method ‍prescribed.\n\nDevices must periodically display warnings prompting users to review all app permissions, with continuous notifications. Companies say notice should be limited to \"highly critical\" permissions.\n\nDevices must store security audit logs, including ​app installations and login attempts, for 12 months.\n\nMAIT argues consumer phones lack the storage capacity ‌for a year of data.\n\nPhones must periodically scan for malware and identify potentially harmful applications.\n\nManufacturers warn that constant on-device scanning significantly drains the battery and slows hardware performance.\n\nOPTION TO REMOVE PRE-INSTALLED APPS:\n\nAll pre-installed apps bundled with the phone operating system, except those essential for basic phone functions, must be deletable.\n\nCompanies argue many apps are critical system components that cannot be ⁠removed.\n\nINFORMING GOVERNMENT OF MAJOR UPDATES:\n\nPhone makers must notify a ​government organisation before releasing any major updates or security ​patches.\n\nManufacturers argue this is \"impractical\" because security fixes must be released quickly to protect users from active exploits, while government delays could leave users vulnerable.\n\nDevices ‍must detect if phones have ⁠been rooted or \"jailbroken\", where users bypass built-in security restrictions, and display continuous warning banners to recommend corrective measures.\n\nCompanies say there is no reliable mechanism to detect jailbreaking.\n\nPhones ⁠must permanently block installation of older software versions, even if officially signed by the manufacturer, to prevent security ‌downgrades.\n\nThere is no global standard related to this requirement, manufacturers say.",

Around 3,500 pieces of content were blocked, and over 600 accounts were deleted. Going forward, X will not allow obscene imagery,\" government sources told news agency ANI.Govt Sends Notice To Elon Musk's X On Grok AI Chatbot Misuse, IT Ministry Seeks Action ReportThe Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) had raised concerns over obscene and harmful content allegedly generated by Elon Musk’s chatbot Grok. The ministry sent a letter to X (formerly Twitter), the social media website owned by Elon Musk, pointing out failures in moderating AI-generated content on its platform. The ministry highlighted concerns that the Grok and other services of xAI have been used to generate and distribute obscene or non-consensual images, particularly targeting the dignity and privacy of women. Through the letter, the government has also sought a report on the actions taken by the company, and the immediate removal of illegal materials.ALSO READ | AI tool to 'undress women': Grok under fire for generating non-consensual sexualised images; Musk pokes funNow, X has submitted a reply to the ministry, however, the officials described it as ‘not adequate’, saying the response by the social media platform lacked specific actions taken and preventive steps implemented.Earlier, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi had written to IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, urging the government to urgently step in over what she described as a disturbing rise in the misuse of AI tools to sexualise women on social media, particularly on X.In her letter, Priyanka Chaturvedi called for strict “guardrails” on AI chatbots such as Grok, saying social media platforms must be made “a safe space for women”. She also underlined the need for better education of men from an early age to prevent such behaviour.“Have sought urgent attention and intervention of the IT Minister to take the issue of increasing incidents of AI apps being prompted to sexualise and undress women by unauthorised use of their images on social media,” Chaturvedi said in a post on X.In the letter shared publicly, the Shiv Sena (UBT) leader flagged what she called an emerging trend on X, where men operating fake accounts allegedly upload photos of women and use AI prompts to minimise their clothing or sexualise them.“It is not just limited to sharing photos through fake accounts but are also targeting women who post their own photos,” she wrote.Calling the practice an “unacceptable and gross misuse of an AI function,” Chaturvedi also criticised Grok for “enabling this behaviour by adhering to such requests”.She described such acts as a “breach of women's right to privacy” and termed them “criminal”, adding that similar instances were “going absolutely unchecked” across other platforms as well.ALSO READ | Elon Musk's Grok AI restricts image editing features to paid X users after Deepfakes go viral across the world",

    "description": "As someone born and raised in India, I've seen a lot of first-time visitors make avoidable mistakes when planning trips, eating street food, and more.",
    "fullText": "As someone who's lived in India my whole life, I've seen it all: the chaos of a Delhi market at noon, the quiet streets of a Rajasthan village, and the seemingly endless railway platforms where people jostle for a spot on a train.\n\nVisitors often come expecting a single \"India experience,\" but having lived in big cities and small towns, I know that the country changes every few hundred miles.\n\nWith different cuisine and customs in every part of the country, it's no wonder first-time visitors to India are often unprepared. Here are the mistakes I see tourists make again and again — and how to avoid them.\n\nMany first-timers fly into Delhi, rush to Agra for the Taj Mahal, and then stop in Jaipur for forts and palaces, believing they've \"done India.\"\n\nThis route, known as the \"Golden Triangle,\" is iconic, but it's also one of the country's most crowded tourist circuits, where hourslong lines and heavy traffic can overshadow the experience.\n\nThat fast, checklist style of travel shows only one version of India: frenetic, historic, and packed with people.\n\nInstead, I'd recommend ditching the crowds and exploring other areas. Some of my favorite underrated parts of India include the cold deserts of Ladakh and Spiti.\n\nDon't skip rural India, either. Well over half of India's population lives in villages, and in my opinion, spending time in one can teach you more about the country than any monument.\n\nWalking through a small-town market and chatting with local families can give tourists a real sense of daily life.\n\nMany travelers try to see all of India in just one or two weeks, but getting from one city to another can take most of a day due to traffic, road conditions, or transportation delays.\n\nPlus, it'll be harder to enjoy everything India has to offer if you're frequently exhausted from a grueling travel experience.\n\nI believe it's better to focus on one city or state at a time.\n\nFor example, you can spend two weeks in Kerala exploring canals, stunning hills, and spice plantations; meanwhile, a trip to Rajasthan can include visits to many colorful cities and the fresco-rich Shekhawati region.\n\nMost travelers skip street food, fearing \"Delhi Belly\" — that is, traveler's diarrhea — but doing so means missing some of India's iconic local flavors.\n\nEach city has its specialties, from Mumbai's vada pav (a potato fritter between buns) to Varanasi's chaat (a savory street snack) to Kolkata's kathi rolls (a kebab rolled inside a flatbread with onions and sauce).\n\nTo enjoy street food safely, I recommend generally following the crowds, since high turnover usually means fresh food.\n\nI'd also suggest avoiding consuming anything cold or raw unless you can peel it yourself, and refraining from using ice unless it's made from bottled water — tap water isn't safe to drink here.\n\nIf you're nervous, you can also book a guided street-food tour. These are available in most major cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Jaipur, and Varanasi.\n\nIndia is famously hospitable: The Sanskrit saying \"Atithi Devo Bhava,\" or \"the guest is god,\" exists for a reason.\n\nThat said, paying attention to some basic customs doesn't take much effort, and it will likely make your interactions smoother and earn you some goodwill.\n\nAcross the country, it's respectful to remove shoes before entering temples or homes, and also to dress modestly, especially in rural areas and religious sites.\n\nI'd also recommend avoiding public displays of affection, as it can make some locals uncomfortable. Finally, use your right hand for eating or passing items, since the left is traditionally considered unclean.\n\nWith 28 states and eight union territories, India's customs can vary widely, so it's also wise to check local etiquette before your trip.\n\nSo much in India runs on WhatsApp messages and OTPs (one-time passwords), so you'll need a local SIM to pay for a cab ride or buy train tickets.\n\nI suggest buying a SIM card at the airport upon arrival, or using an eSIM. Preload it with enough data for your entire trip; adding more later can sometimes be tricky with foreign cards.\n\nWhile you're at it, take out some cash, too. The Indian rupee is our only official currency, and although many shops and restaurants accept digital payments, it's smart to carry cash for smaller vendors at local markets.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 8 (Reuters) - India's finance ministry plans to scrap five-year-old restrictions on Chinese firms bidding for government contracts, two sources said, as New Delhi seeks ​to revive commercial ties in an environment of eased diplomatic and border tensions.\n\nThe curbs, imposed in 2020 ‌after a deadly clash between the countries' troops, required Chinese bidders to register with an Indian government committee and obtain political and security clearances.\n\nThe ‌measures effectively barred Chinese firms from competing for Indian government contracts that were estimated to be worth $700 billion to $750 billion.\n\n\"Officials are working to remove the registration requirement for bidders from bordering nations,\" one government source said, declining to be named as they were not authorised to speak publicly.\n\nThe final decision will be made by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office, both the ⁠sources said.\n\nThe restrictions had a significant ‌impact: Months after they were unveiled, China's state-owned CRRC was disqualified from bidding for a $216 million train-manufacturing contract.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance's plan to ease curbs followed requests from other government departments ‍that are facing shortages and project delays due to the 2020 restrictions.\n\n\"Several ministries have requested exemptions to overcome the constraints that could derail projects in their sectors,\" the second government source said.\n\nSoon after India imposed its restrictions, the value of new projects awarded to ‌Chinese bidders fell 27% from a year earlier to $1.67 billion in 2021, according to a 2024 report from the Observer Research Foundation.\n\nSpecifically, curbs on imports from China of equipment for the power sector have hindered India's plans to raise its thermal power capacity to about 307 GW over the next decade.\n\nA high-level committee headed by a former cabinet secretary, Rajiv Gauba, has also recommended easing the restrictions. Gauba is now a member of a top government think tank.\n\nIndia's finance ministry ⁠and the prime minister's office did not respond to Reuters requests ​for comment.\n\nLast year, Modi visited China for the first time in ​seven years and agreed to foster deeper commercial ties with Beijing following U.S. President Donald Trump's 50% punitive tariff on Indian goods and in light of Washington's warming relations with Pakistan.",

    "description": "When Claire Drinkwater boarded a plane alone to India, she wondered if she'd finally lost her mind.",
    "fullText": "I used to love coming home from vacation.\n\nThe way the plane would swoop over London's skyscrapers and the River Thames before landing at Heathrow. Returning to my favorite places, people, and my job. Until one day, I burst into tears on a flight home from Italy.\n\nWhen I turned 30, I thought I had it all with a great career in London managing communications for TV networks. Then my long-term relationship ended. Suddenly, I had to find somewhere else to live and learn how to be alone again.\n\nMeanwhile, the job I loved became increasingly demanding. It all took its toll on my health. I felt sick every day: working late, eating sporadically, and waking in a panic at night. Nothing seemed to make a difference — not therapy, new hobbies, or healthier habits.\n\nOne day, friends invited me to go backpacking around Italy. It was the chance to escape my routine and get the fresh perspective I needed, so I joined them in Milan. Together, we explored the country by train: sleeping in hostels, slurping pasta, and dancing into the night.\n\nOn the plane home, watching Milan's russet roofs disappear under the clouds, I couldn't stop the tears. I wanted to stay, as this version of me, one who reminded me of my younger self. When I was a student, I used to walk past a travel agency near my university. I promised myself that one day I'd plan a big adventure. But I never had.\n\nThis spark ignited a long-dormant dream of traveling the world. I worried about abandoning the career I'd worked so hard to achieve. But I couldn't hold on any more to a life I'd fallen out of love with.\n\nI quit my job and booked a round-the-world route spanning nine countries across three continents.\n\nBoarding the plane alone to my first stop in India, I wondered if I'd finally lost my mind.\n\nOn my first morning, I awoke at a beachside yoga resort in Goa, India to the sound of the waves. Even there, so far from home, my anxiety had disturbed my sleep, as if I'd packed it in my backpack.\n\nBut over the next few weeks, practicing yoga and meditation calmed my body and mind. I learned to be spontaneous, to say yes to invitations, and to enjoy the moment. By the time I left a month later, I felt I was leaving behind a piece of my heart.\n\nMy next stop was Malaysia, where I took scuba diving lessons. Struggling to breathe underwater, I panicked and almost gave up. Eventually, I got the hang of it and even passed my diving certification. On my 33rd birthday, I arrived in Bali, where I learned to rest and relax.\n\nMy yearlong route took me to countries including New Zealand, where I got a temp job in communications, climbed volcanoes, and enjoyed barbecues on the beach with new friends. In Chile, I saw shooting stars over the Atacama Desert, as the vast universe looked down on our small planet.\n\nReturning to the UK, my plane circled over London. The city looked the same, but I was different. I had met a guy from Belgium toward the end of my trip; he had just begun his journey.\n\nWe got along so well that we ended up going on trips together and even visited each other in our home countries.\n\nWhen he got his old job back and moved home, I realized how much I'd miss him. So I faced a choice. Put down my roots again in the UK and try a long-distance relationship, or take a chance. I decided to trust myself one more time.\n\nOnce again, I packed my bags, this time for Belgium, a country I'd never considered living in.\n\nI didn't speak the languages and so much was different to what I was used to. But I made friends and rebuilt my communications career in Brussels.\n\nIt's been over 10 years, and we're still together, living in Belgium. Now I enjoy browsing the weekly markets or sitting on a terrace watching the world go by — even the slow service at restaurants that used to drive me mad. I still love to travel, and now I have someone to share the sunsets with and laugh with when things go wrong.\n\nI still get a happy tingle in my stomach when I travel back to London to visit, and that will never change.\n\nThat year taught me that home isn't only about where you're born. It's about where you feel comfortable, through the people and experiences that matter.\n\nYou can create a home more than once, in more than one place.\n\nDo you have a story about taking a gap year that you want to share?

    "fullText": "Amazon is allowing employees who are stranded in India because of visa delays to work remotely there until early March, according to an internal memo viewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe catch: They're not allowed to code, make strategic decisions, or interact with customers.\n\nAmazon is one of many American companies scrambling to adapt to the Trump administration's rapid-fire changes to the H-1B visa program, including a mandate that consular officers must review visa applicants' social media posts before issuing visas. The additional screening has delayed processing, and some embassies and consulates have rescheduled visa appointments by several months, leaving some employees stranded outside the country.\n\nThe delays have prompted Google, Apple, Microsoft, and other companies to issue travel advisories in recent weeks, warning US employees with visas to avoid international travel to prevent extended stays outside the US.\n\nAmazon allows employees traveling abroad for visa renewals to work remotely for up to 20 business days, an exemption from the normal requirement that they work in their office five days a week. Now, any Amazon employee in India as of December 13 and who awaits a rescheduled visa appointment may work remotely until March 2, according to the memo, which was posted to Amazon's internal HR portal on December 17.\n\nThe permission to work remotely comes with a long list of constraints. Employees working remotely from India are barred from coding of any kind, including troubleshooting and testing. They cannot work from or visit Amazon buildings. And they cannot negotiate or sign contracts.\n\n\"All reviews, final decision making, and sign offs should be undertaken outside India,\" the memo says.\n\nThe memo also said that \"in compliance with local laws, there are no exceptions to these restrictions.\"\n\nThe memo does not provide guidance for employees whose visa appointments have been rescheduled beyond March 2, 2026, or for those stranded in a different country. Some US embassies and consulates have rescheduled appointments as far out as 2027.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nFor employees in technical roles, the restrictions raised questions about what work they can actually perform.\n\n\"Seventy to eighty percent of my job is coding, testing, deploying, and documenting,\" one Amazon software engineer told Business Insider.\n\nA State Department spokesperson in December told Business Insider that the purpose of the social media reviews is to use \"all available tools\" to flag visa applicants who are inadmissible, including those who pose a risk to national interests.\n\nThe delays pose a particular challenge for Amazon, which is among the largest users of the H-1B program. During the 2024 government fiscal year, Amazon filed 14,783 certified H-1B applications, including 23 for Whole Foods, according to Business Insider's analysis of publicly available data from the Department of Labor and US Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Ashwini Gangal felt like a trailing spouse when she left her life in India behind to move to the US on a H-4 visa, as her husband's dependant.",
    "fullText": "My husband and I met on a dating app in 2021. He had moved to the US in 2009 and was in Mumbai, where I lived, to visit family.\n\nHis trip marked the start of our whirlwind intercontinental romance. In April 2022, after nearly a year of long-distance dating between the US and India, we got married in Mumbai, where I had spent all 36 years of my life. Nearly six months after the wedding, I moved from high-octane Mumbai to Sunnyvale, a sleepy suburb in San Francisco's Bay Area, leaving my job as the managing editor of an online business publication and bidding my friends and family goodbye. At the time, my husband worked in tech on an H-1B employment visa, which meant I could move to the US on an H-4 dependent spouse visa.\n\nWhen I got to the US, the heady joy of marital bliss was soon eclipsed by a crisis of identity. While I was glad to have found the man of my dreams à la Bollywood, I felt bitter about being a \"trailing spouse,\" moving to a new country for love, at the cost of professional stability. The busy editor who led a team of reporters in Mumbai quickly became an alter ego from a past life. Plus, I was incredibly lonely. It was only after roughly three years in the States that I began to think of Sunnyvale as home.\n\nAs a well-traveled Anglophone, I felt no culture shock when I arrived in America, with the exception of the \"do-it-yourself\" culture common to the Western world. I was a Bombay brat who always had house help to cook and clean for me. In the US, I tortured my gut bacteria with junk food for months before grudgingly learning my way around the kitchen.\n\nIn my head, I thought I'd only take a short break from work following my relocation. It took around six months after landing in the States to get my work authorization, known as the EAD, and then, I was all set to pick up my pen and notepad and return to work as a journalist.\n\nBut I found landing full-time work extremely difficult. Every day, I searched online job portals for journalism roles to apply to, but I was either ghosted or rejected every time.\n\nIsolation made these rejections harder to handle. Friendless \"visa brides,\" as I sometimes call immigrants of my ilk, have no one to share their burdens with.\n\nAlthough I did make friends over time, it was extremely difficult to connect with people initially, because loneliness is baked into suburban Californian life. In contrast to the throbbing metropolis of Mumbai, the Bay Area is quiet and boring, with vast distances between any two places of interest. It's not unusual to have to take multiple freeways to get to a grocery store or restaurant. Some roads don't even have footpaths for you to walk on. Public transport is a joke, so in these soulless suburbs, your car becomes a detachable extension of your body.\n\nA few months into my life in the Bay, I knew I was experiencing something that went beyond homesickness. I cried frequently, sometimes breaking down in public places. I slept badly, worried constantly, and lost my confidence. It felt like I was having a breakdown in slow motion.\n\nLearning how to drive, and getting my license in February 2023, was a big part of my emotional recovery. I'd always been afraid of driving, but now I've overcome it, I'm no longer dependent on my husband for transport. I have at long last befriended the asphalt.\n\nOne of my first long-distance drives was to a town called Turlock, nearly 100 miles from my place, where I did a live poetry reading.\n\nFinancially, I had to depend on my husband while I struggled to find work. But over the past three years, I've picked up some freelance writing assignments, which have granted me some financial freedom, and I've been able to lease my own car, a gorgeous black Tesla.\n\nI'm not the first \"visa wife,\" nor will I be the last. My story is the story of many women who've put oceans between themselves and their family, friends, and work, to move for love. My experience with immigration has taught me that when you move countries, your skills come with you, and if you believe in yourself, they can help you rebuild your professional identity.\n\nI'm proud to have strengthened my identity as a writer during this difficult time. I've written news articles for local outlets, works of fiction and poetry, and non-fiction essays based on my experience as an immigrant. For me, \"home\" is a place where people know my name, and building up professional recognition in the US has given me a greater sense of belonging.\n\nThat said, even though I've picked up temporary work, like contract jobs and freelance gigs, full-time employment remains elusive. I'm still actively looking for jobs, but I've come to believe that the struggle has less to do with my own abilities than imperfect algorithms on job portals, a volatile job market, and a general skew in the Bay Area toward software and technological skills, which makes me feel less in demand as a writer.\n\nI don't write code. I write stories. In \"Alf layla wa Layla,\" an ancient West Asian collection of folk tales, popularly known as \"The Arabian Nights,\" it takes princess Scheherazade a thousand nights to find the path to survival through storytelling.\n\nI fancy myself a modern-day Scheherazade in Sunnyvale, and, having lived as a writer in Silicon Valley for over a thousand days now, I think I'll survive too.\n\nDo you have a story to share about being on an H-4 or another dependent visa?
