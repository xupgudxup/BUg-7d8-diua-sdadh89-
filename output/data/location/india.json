    "description": "Rishab Jolly moved to the US to get his MBA after starting his engineering career in India. He was hired at Microsoft in 2017 as a product manager.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rishab Jolly, a 37-year-old senior product manager at Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington. Business Insider has verified Jolly's employment history with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBefore moving to the US in 2015, I studied engineering and computer science in India, where I worked as both a software quality tester and an engineer.\n\nI was always interested in the business side of technology, so I left my job in India to pursue an MBA at the University of Arizona. My goal was to gain business acumen to complement my engineering background. I saw firsthand how much innovation takes place in the US and how many opportunities exist to work on cutting-edge products, which inspired me to build my career here.\n\nOne of the most valuable parts of the MBA program was its partnerships with Big Tech companies. As part of the curriculum, representatives from Microsoft, Amazon, and Google brought projects to campus.\n\nStudents formed teams, worked on deliverables, and were graded by company representatives. In 2016, I was team lead on a Microsoft project, and we did an excellent job. That gave me a chance to network and to demonstrate my skills to an actual Microsoft product manager.\n\nI applied to about 200 jobs, sending the same generic résumé without referrals. I received only three calls back and passed two interviews, but both offers were subsequently rescinded: one company considered my visa too risky without a STEM extension, and another cited budgetary reasons.\n\nI needed to secure a job within 60-90 days after graduation, or I would be forced to return to India. I ran out of money, asked a friend if I could crash on their couch, and felt a constant sense of anxiety.\n\nDuring that time, I stayed in touch with the Microsoft contact I'd met through my MBA project. When an opening came up, I asked if he would refer me.\n\nHe agreed, and I rewrote my résumé to match the specific role. The hiring manager liked my application, called me in, and I got a shot. That referral and tailoring my résumé made all the difference.\n\nI was hired by Microsoft in July 2017 and started as a product manager. I became a senior product manager in 2021.\n\nFirst, you have to get the interview, and second, you have to pass it. For the first step, referrals are critical. Big Tech companies receive tens of thousands of résumés every month. A referral can push yours to the top of the stack.\n\nTo prepare for interviews, I relied heavily on mock interviews. I reached out to peers who had been in the same boat and asked them to test me. They helped me refine my storytelling, practice answering metrics-driven questions, and pinpoint areas for improvement.\n\nWhen I finally interviewed at Microsoft, the feedback I received was that my stories were authentic and clearly based on real experiences. That authenticity resonated far more than rehearsed answers pulled from the internet.\n\nIn today's tech world, showcasing your skills outside work or school, whether on LinkedIn, GitHub, or through personal projects, demonstrates passion and initiative.\n\nI started posting more consistently on LinkedIn during the pandemic. I shared lessons from my career, thoughts on product management, and observations about the industry. I wasn't trying to \"build a following,\" I just focused on topics that genuinely resonated with me.\n\nOver time, those posts resonated with others, and a community naturally formed around them. The growth happened gradually and organically, simply because people connected with the ideas and conversations.\n\nRecruiters notice when you go beyond the curriculum to learn new tools or contribute to open-source projects. In a fast-changing industry where AI and new technologies emerge every six months, demonstrating your ability to adapt and self-learn is as important as the content of your résumé.\n\nWhile a small percentage of jobs may prefer an MBA, I know successful product managers who came from accounting, English literature, or completely different areas. Microsoft values diverse backgrounds because innovation thrives when teams bring fresh perspectives.\n\nEven with this knowledge, I would still pursue an MBA because it was not just about academics; it was also about gaining practical experience. It provided me with exposure to new perspectives, helped me transition into product management, and connected me with mentors and peers who have shaped my career in meaningful ways.\n\nI don't think an MBA is mandatory for everyone. It depends on your goals and whether you're looking for a career pivot, a network, or structured learning.\n\nVisa restrictions, financial pressure, and cultural adjustments can make the experience stressful. I had moments when I felt defeated, but staying focused and working smart eventually brought everything together.\n\nAfter over eight years at Microsoft, I plan to continue contributing to the technology and innovation ecosystem. I'm exploring the appropriate pathways that align with my career goals, but nothing is finalized at this time. My focus is on the work itself and continuing to grow professionally.\n\nMy advice to anyone following a similar path is straightforward: network strategically, prepare thoroughly, stay authentic, and continually build your skills and presence. Things may look uncertain now, but persistence and the right relationships can open doors you didn't think were possible.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI (AP) — A protest erupted in India’s capital Tuesday in response to the death of a Hindu man who was lynched and burned by an angry mob in neighboring Bangladesh, a new sign of strain in relations between the neighboring countries.\n\nThe protest in New Delhi, mainly led by Hindu nationalist organization Vishva Hindu Parishad, highlights the fragility in the relationship between India and Bangladesh, which often is held up as a rare example of stability in South Asia.\n\nBangladeshi student leader Sharif Osman Hadi died in a hospital in Singapore on Thursday after being shot on Dec. 12 in Dhaka. Police in Bangladesh said they identified suspects and the shooter likely had fled to India.\n\nHadi’s death triggered widespread violence in Dhaka. The offices of two national daily newspapers were torched and Indian diplomatic missions were targeted. A Hindu man also was burned alive, which sparked the protest Tuesday in India.\n\nHundreds of demonstrators gathered Tuesday near the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi, shouting slogans and accusing Bangladeshi groups of wrongly targeting minorities. They carried placards and banners with slogans including “India will not tolerate torture of Hindus in Bangladesh” and “Our silence should not be mistaken as weakness, we are lions.”\n\nAuthorities erected barricades and imposed tight security around the diplomatic enclave that included police and armored vehicles. Security personnel used batons to hold back some protesters who broke through barricades in an apparent attempt to enter the embassy.\n\nOne of the Indian protestors, Rajkumar Jindal, threatened “dire consequences” if authorities in Bangladesh failed to stop violence against Hindus.\n\n“People who are committing atrocities should stop doing that. We are here to awaken the people who are asleep,” Jindal said.\n\nHadi took part in a 2024 political uprising that ended the 15-year rule of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who has been in exile since fleeing Bangladesh on Aug. 5, 2024. He was a fierce critic of India and Hasina and planned to run as an independent candidate in a major constituency in Dhaka in the next national elections in February.\n\nHadi's death sparked a new diplomatic squabble with India and prompted New Delhi this week to summon Bangladesh’s envoy.\n\nBangladesh’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also summoned Pranay Verma, the Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh, to apprise him of the security situation at Bangladesh missions in New Delhi and state capitals Kolkata and Agartala, a leading Bengali-language newspaper reported Tuesday.\n\nTensions between India and Bangladesh increased again with the death on Thursday of Dipu Chandra Das, a 25-year-old Hindu man who was lynched and burned publicly following allegations of blasphemy in Mymensingh district’s Bhaluka subdistrict.\n\nDas's killing contributed to a pattern of fear among the Hindu community in Bangladesh following the ouster of Hasina.\n\nReligious minority groups including Hindus and Christians have accused Bangladesh's interim government headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus of failing to protect the safety of Hindus and others. The Yunus administration has rejected the allegations.\n\nTuesday's protest could complicate cooperation on trade, border management and regional connectivity at a time when the region is already grappling with economic uncertainty and political polarization, said Sreeram Sundar Chaulia, an international affairs expert at New Delhi’s Jindal School of International Affairs.\n\n“Opposing India and alleging Indian conspiracies of interference in Bangladesh are being done in order to harden a blatantly Islamist and non-inclusive path for the country,” Chaulia said.\n\nThe rupture is a setback to India’s broader regional strategy, while for Bangladesh the loss of India’s development assistance and markets could further dampen the country's slowing economy and push it further into dependence on China, Chaulia said.\n\nBangladesh and India have enjoyed a warm relationship since 2009 when Hasina came to power and until her ouster. Hasina was considered a friend by India and both countries thrived on bilateral cooperation. But Hasina’s opponents accused her administration of being subservient to India, a major trade and investment partner.",

So we have to stand with them,” a senior Mohun Bagan official told the Reuters news agency.\n\nMohun Bagan have five players from Australia, Spain and the United Kingdom, countries that have advised their citizens against travel to Iran, the official added.\n\nThe club also did not travel to Iran last year for a match against Tractor SC scheduled for October 2, 2024, the day after Iran launched ballistic missiles towards Israel.

    "title": "When Red in the US Is Green in India – The AQI Disparity Problem",
    "description": "AirGradient air quality monitoring.",
    "fullText": "If you look at an air quality map of India, you’ll find that the map looks completely different depending on whether you’re in India or the US. This stems from the major disparities that exist between national air quality indices (AQIs), which use different categorization labels, benchmarks, and colours to denote air quality.\n\nIndia’s National Air Quality Index (NAQI), as seen above on the left, reveals mostly green and yellow clusters, representing “satisfactory” and “moderate” air. For the same exact clusters measured in the same period, using the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) AQI, seen on the right, will show mostly orange and red. These represent “unhealthy for sensitive groups” or generally “unhealthy” air, signalling a significantly higher level of concern.\n\nHere we can see the difference between the categories of these two AQIs – India’s NAQI on the left, and the US AQI on the right. NAQI’s “good” and “satisfactory” standards cover two separate categories, seen here on the AirGradient map legend in two shades of green. For those without a careful eye for detail, this can make a “satisfactory” cluster be mistaken for a “good” one.\n\nThis further highlights the difficulty of comparing cross-country indices; greens, oranges, and reds don’t automatically correspond, and can even be split within one index.\n\nIn its 2021 air quality guidelines, the World Health Organization (WHO) says that a 24-hour average PM2.5 concentration above 15 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) is already beyond its recommended limit. India’s system, in contrast, sets the comparable 24-hour threshold of PM2.5 at 60 µg/m3, which is four times higher.\n\nHowever, India is far from being alone in exceeding this limit. China sets its limit at 75 µg/m3, the European Union at 50 µg/m3, the US at 35 µg/m3, and Canada at 28 µg/m3, just to name a few.\n\nFrom a health perspective, the implications are striking: two people breathing air with the same level of PM2.5 in two different countries could be told very different stories about how safe that air is. This gap silently shapes how millions of people understand the air they breathe, and can influence the activities they undertake in their day-to-day lives. For example, recommendations related to prolonged and strenuous outdoor activities are particularly important, seeing as exercise poses additional health risks due to the increased uptake and deposit of pollutants in the lungs.\n\nAfter all, WHO guidelines remain advisory, and hence, governments have no legal obligation to abide by them. However, they are formulated by expert committees with the aim of informing local policymaking.\n\nFirstly, there’s a technological disparity to note, as countries use different types of reference grade monitors as the ‘official’ norm, which measure air pollution differences. India’s official monitors use beta attenuation monitors (BAMs), which physically weigh particles and require regular maintenance and biyearly calibration, whereas many private platforms use low-maintenance sensor-based devices that rely on laser scattering. BAMs are more accurate and better suited for measuring higher concentrations, which fits with India’s local context. However, without the regular maintenance required, this advantage may be negated, and the accuracy of the data reported may in fact suffer.\n\nAccording to Gufran Beig, founder director of India’s national air quality monitoring system SAFAR, “every country has built its index based on its own adaptability, weather and local environment”. India’s Northern Plain, for example, experiences natural dust storms. These increase both coarse and fine particulate matter concentrations in the ambient air, which cause conditions to exceed the WHO limit. Adopting this standard in these locations would classify air as polluted even without human activity.\n\nThe Indian Environment Ministry raises another point regarding the need to account for “socio-economic status and national circumstances”. While the country is striving to transition towards cleaner alternatives in accordance with the National Action Plan on Climate Change, most of the energy consumed in India is derived from fossil fuels, particularly coal. Meanwhile, the combustion of coal, petrol, diesel, gas, biomass, and waste accounts for 81% of PM2.5 pollution. Therefore, reducing air pollution would logically entail targeting this sector. If India were to strictly adhere to international standards, it would require an overhaul of its energy production systems, transportation, and construction, and would incur significant job losses in the fossil fuel sector. This would impact economic growth and development goals, yielding social and political challenges.\n\nShould there be a standardized international index, or should we allow for cross-country variation?\n\nOn one hand, a stricter index aligned with WHO limits might better reflect health risks and allow for comparable scales, but would expose the severity of a problem that is expensive and politically costly to fix. On the other, a looser index can account for local contexts, and reduce public alarm and short-term political pressure. However, this may come at the cost of long-term passivity.\n\nAt AirGradient, we are grappling with this question ourselves. On our mobile app, which features a map that visualizes real-time air quality data, users can select to display values either as raw concentration values (µg/m³) or using the U.S. EPA Air Quality Index (AQI) scale.\n\nShould we also integrate other national indices such as India’s NAQI? This would allow us to reach a larger audience and adapt to what users are familiar with, but would also mean shaping norms towards an acceptance of indices that may be misinforming their users of the real health risks.\n\nYou can download the AirGradient map and test out the index displays here: App Store / Play Store\n\nCentral Pollution Control Board.

The trio moved on to Hyderabad later that day, then to Mumbai on Sunday before finishing in New Delhi on Monday.\n\nIndia was the only country the tour visited.\n\nThere was a variety of ticket options to suit budgets.\n\nFor access to the stadium only, face value tickets cost 3,500 rupees (£29) for Kolkata and Hyderabad. For New Dehli, the price was 4,200 rupees (£35).\n\nHowever, this is about half the average weekly wage in India. But with tickets sold out, fans were paying much more for the chance to see Messi.\n\nReports in Indian media said some locals had paid up to 12,000 rupees (£99) to get in.\n\nAmong the other ticket types was a VVIP option which included a meet-and-greet with Messi, including a photograph. Only 100 were available at a price of one million rupees (£8,200).\n\nMessi landed in Kolkata at 01:30 local time. Thousands lined the roads and congregated outside his hotel to catch a glimpse of him.\n\nThe day began with the meet-and-greet ticket holders first up from 09:00 to 10:30.\n\nThen the day took a strange twist.\n\nA 70ft statue of Messi lifting the World Cup was unveiled by the former Barcelona icon.\n\nBut he was not present - it was a virtual unveiling. He was on a video screen and pressed a button on a remote control. At this point a blue sheet dropped to reveal the huge iron structure.\n\nMessi met with Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan before heading to Salt Lake Stadium for 11:30.\n\nThe plan was for him to be at the ground for an hour. He was gone after only 20 minutes and violence erupted because ticket holders did not get to see Messi among the throng of security, politicians and celebrities.\n\n\"Only leaders and actors were surrounding Messi. Why did they call us then? We have got a ticket for 12,000 rupees, but we were not even able to see his face,\" a fan at the stadium told Indian news agency ANI.\n\nOne angry supporter told the Press Trust of India news agency that people had paid the equivalent of a month's salary to see the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner.\n\n\"I paid 5,000 rupees for the ticket and came with my son to watch Messi, not politicians,\" they said.\n\n\"The police and military personnel were taking selfies, and the management is to blame.\"\n\nThere was supposed to be a friendly match, more of kickabout, with some local players but this did not happen.\n\nMessi was whisked off to Hyderabad.\n\nMessi walked out at the stadium waving to fans, but after his appearance was abruptly ended some frustrated supporters stormed the pitch and vandalised banners and tents, while others hurled plastic chairs and water bottles.\n\nWest Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said she was \"deeply disturbed and shocked\" by the events.\n\nAnnouncing an enquiry, Banerjee apologised to Messi and \"sports lovers\" for the scenes at the stadium.\n\n\"The [enquiry] committee will conduct a detailed enquiry into the incident, fix responsibility, and recommend measures to prevent such occurrences in the future,\" she added on X.\n\nA spokesperson for Messi said he fulfilled the time commitment that had been agreed in advance. In terms of the organisation of the event itself, he referred the BBC to the apology issued by Banerjee on social media.\n\nKolkata's Telegraph newspaper said in an editorial piece that \"poor management of a hyped-up event, lack of co-ordination\" and security lapses turned the stadium into a \"battlefield\".\n\nSatadru Dutta, the event organiser, was arrested and a city court remanded him in police custody for 14 days.\n\nThe rest of the tour appears to have gone without a hitch, with fans getting to see Messi, Suarez and De Paul.\n\nThe Times of India reported how the event in Hyderabad went smoothly, with the stands full and Messi staying on the pitch for a full hour.\n\nAfter leaving Hyderabad, on Sunday Messi met with India cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar in Mumbai.\n\nFog delayed their arrival into Dehli on Monday, where thousands of fans gathered inside New Delhi's Arun Jaitley Stadium and were treated to a half-hour appearance when the trio kicked balls into the stands, passed balls with a group of children and signed autographs.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

On Saturday angry fans vandalised a Kolkata stadium because they didn't get to see him during his appearance there.\n\nMessi had a packed schedule in India, attending a string of promotional events in Kolkata, Hyderabad and Mumbai since arriving in the early hours of Saturday.\n\nBefore heading to Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium later that day, he virtually unveiled a 70ft (21m) statue of himself, assembled over 27 days by a 45-strong crew in the eastern city.\n\nThe tour, however, got off to a disastrous start after angry fans ripped up seats and threw items towards the pitch at the stadium.\n\nFootball is hugely popular in West Bengal state - of which Kolkata is the capital - and thousands of adoring supporters had paid up to 12,000 rupees (£100; $133) to attend the event.\n\nHowever, most of them didn't even get to see him as he was surrounded by officials and celebrities on his brief walk around the stadium and then quickly whisked away as the situation turned hostile.\n\nKolkata's The Telegraph newspaper said in an editorial that \"poor management of a hyped-up event, lack of co-ordination\" and security lapses turned the stadium into a \"battlefield\", as fans - denied even a glimpse of Messi - \"vented their anger by indulging in violence\".\n\nThe ruckus, which made international headlines, cast a shadow over Messi's first visit to India since 2011 for what has been called a 'GOAT [greatest of all time] tour'.\n\nThe event organiser in Kolkata has been arrested, police said, and a city court has remanded Satadru Dutta to 14 days in police custody.\n\nMessi's visits to Hyderabad and Mumbai passed off smoothly, with fans sharing their delight at seeing the global icon online and in media interviews.\n\nMessi also met several politicians and celebrities - Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan in Kolkata (at his hotel before the stadium fiasco), opposition leader Rahul Gandhi in Hyderabad, and cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar in Mumbai.\n\nIn between these interactions, Messi could be seen waving to large fan gatherings in stadiums and dribbling the ball with groups of children.\n\nThere were reports earlier that Messi would meet Narendra Modi in Delhi, but the Indian prime minister left the country on Monday morning on a scheduled visit to Jordan, Ethiopia and Oman.\n\nMessi's popularity stems not just from his long international career and wide TV coverage of European football - he's record scorer for Barcelona, the team he used to play for - but also the emotional connection that millions of Indians have with what is often called the beautiful game.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "fullText": "An all-new Croft adventure, Tomb Raider Catalyst, will be released in 2027 – and a remake of the action heroine’s first adventure arrives next year\n\nAfter a long break for Lara Croft, a couple of fresh Tomb Raider adventures are on their way. They will be the first new games in the series since 2018, and both will be published by Amazon.\n\nAnnounced at the Game Awards in LA, Tomb Raider Catalyst stars the “charismatic, self-assured, formidable Lara Croft” from the original 1990s games, says game director Will Kerslake. It’s set in the markets, mountains, and naturally the ancient buildings of northern India, where Lara is racing with other treasure hunters to track down potentially cataclysmic artefacts. It will be out in 2027.\n\nCatalyst is in development at Crystal Dynamics, the Canadian developer that has looked after Tomb Raider since 2003. Crystal Dynamics previously developed Tomb Raiders Legend, Anniversary and Underworld, as well as the reboot trilogy that featured a younger, more vulnerable Lara. Its most recent game in the series was 2018’s Shadow of the Tomb Raider.\n\nTomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, meanwhile, is being developed in collaboration with Flying Wild Hog in Poland. Featuring modernised combat and redesigned tomb-delving puzzles, the game is an “expanded” ground-up reimagining of Lara Croft’s very first 1996 adventure, which established her as one of gaming’s most recognisable characters. “Our goal was to respect the spirit of Core Design’s original game, while updating the experience for today’s gamers including building it with Unreal Engine 5,” Kerslake says. “We see this is a reimagining of the original game with a gameplay experience that wasn’t possible on the technology at the time.” Legacy of Atlantis will be out in 2026.\n\nIn both games, Croft will be played by the British actor Alix Wilton Regan, who previously had significant roles in Dragon Age: Inquisition and Cyberpunk 2077. She was also due to star as Joanna Dark in the cancelled remake of 2000’s spy-shooter Perfect Dark.\n\nDespite the series’ recent hiatus, Tomb Raider still has immense brand recognition, built on its 1990s heyday. Amazon also has a TV series in the works with Phoebe Waller-Bridge, which is to star Sophie Turner as Croft. Over 30 years, Croft has been everything from Playboy pin-up to rugged wilderness adventurer to gentlewoman action hero.\n\n“Across the series, our goal is to show that Lara is always evolving,” Kerslake says. “Her core DNA will remain, but we believe it’s important to show how each adventure shapes her character over time.”",

The Fed’s 25-basis-point cut has taken one big global worry off the table, and regional markets are cheering the move. Whether that’s enough to steady Indian equities is unclear after Wednesday’s late slide pulled the market to a near month-low. Mid- and small-cap stocks may get some relief from the regulator allowing pension funds to invest in the Nifty 250 and BSE 250 indices. But with the outlook on a trade deal with Washington still murky and bond yields climbing to three-month highs — pressuring the rupee — investors are watching how long India can hold out against the global “lower for longer” narrative. Also in focus will be monthly mutual fund inflows numbers amid chatter that retail investors are running out of patience.",

    "fullText": "Australia's landmark move to ban under-16s from social media will be closely watched by other countries, which could follow suit with similar laws.\n\n- Mumbai: 'Nothing is black or white' -\n\nAt the seafront in India's Mumbai, 19-year-old Pratigya Jena scrolls with her friends through Instagram videos of a posing influencer and a camel at a beach.\n\nSocial media \"should be partially banned because according to me nothing is either black or white\", the student said.\n\n\"Gen Z are very active, they are doing really well on social media. And doing great things, especially young entrepreneurs,\" Jena said.\n\nAt the same time, children watching adult content online \"has a very bad effect\".\n\nAt a Mumbai park, cricket coach Pratik Bhurke, 38, said Australia's move would encourage children to spend time outdoors and could have \"great benefits\" in India too.\n\nIn the chilly German capital, Luna Drewes, 13, is watching selfie-style TikTok clips posted by other young people.\n\n\"Actually a good thing in some ways because social media often portrays a certain image of how people should look, like girls have to be thin,\" she said of the ban.\n\nAnother teenager, Enno Caro Brandes, said: \"I'm 15 so for me the ban would definitely come into effect. I can't really imagine giving it up completely.\n\n\"A ban is a bit extreme, but it could definitely help to do a detox.\"\n\nAn AI baby singing and answering interview questions are among the videos served up to Firdha Razak, 16, as she scrolls in her room.\n\nRazak is not in favour of a ban. \"It's really stupid, honestly,\" although \"there's not really much we can do as 16-year-olds\" if governments decide to act, she said.\n\nThe families of many people in Qatar live abroad, so \"it's going to be so much harder to talk to them\".\n\nAlso in Doha, Youssef Walid, 16, said bans like Australia's were \"a bit harsh\" and hard to enforce.\n\n\"We can use VPN. We can easily bypass the security and easily make new accounts,\" he said.\n\n- Lagos: 'We were born with it' -\n\nAt a Nigerian high school, Mitchelle Okinedo is revising for exams, checking over her hand-written notes. In the classroom -- where phones are banned -- students in uniform sit at separate desks.\n\n\"I see where the (Australian) government is coming from. Students nowadays, they are really distracted,\" Okinedo said.\n\nEven so, \"we were born with it\", the 15-year-old added. \"And I don't think it's something I want to stop.\"\n\nHer mother, 50-year-old event planner Hannah Okinedo, agrees with a social media ban for under-16s, saying most parents \"don't have time to monitor their children all day\".\n\n- Mexico City: 'Express yourself' -\n\nYoung Mexico City resident Aranza Gomez, 11, has had a smartphone with access to social media for one year.\n\nWithout it, \"I would honestly feel sad. I wouldn't really have a good way to spend my time,\" she said.\n\nSantiago Ramirez Rojas, 16, is sitting on a bench in the Tabacalera district, scrolling through posts containing news about Argentina and tour dates for a musician.\n\n\"Social media today is very important for expressing yourself, no matter how old you are,\" said Rojas.\n\nBut \"there are many kidnappings that begin online\" and \"younger kids, around 10 or 12, are much more vulnerable\".\n\n- Sydney: 'Not going to have any impact' -\n\nIn Australia one family has diverging ideas on how the law will go.\n\n\"I don't think the government really knows what they're doing and I don't think it's going to have any impact on children of Australia,\" said 15-year-old Layton Lewis.\n\nBut his mother Emily Lewis hopes it will help children \"have better, more authentic relationships\".\n\n\"They'll make proper plans, like we used to, to meet up with their friends face-to-face and have proper conversations as opposed to these illusive friendships online,\" she said.",

    "fullText": "BENGALURU, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Amnesty International has said India's review of a telecom industry proposal to mandate always-on satellite ​location tracking on phones for better lawful surveillance was \"deeply concerning\" and puts data ‌of human rights defenders at risk.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's government has long pushed telecoms companies to give ‌more precise locations of individuals under investigation.\n\nThe telecoms operators say the best way to achieve this would be for the government to order smartphone manufacturers to permanently enable location tracking on phones. Reuters reported on Friday that the government is reviewing that proposal.\n\nThe discussions are ⁠being privately opposed by big ‌smartphone firms Apple, Google and Samsung, due to privacy and security concerns.\n\nIn a statement to Reuters, Amnesty International said location data can ‍be \"incredibly revealing\" and can expose personal and professional connections, such as the confidential sources who meet journalists or human rights groups.\n\n\"This is deeply concerning. At a time where surveillance scandals are a ​mushrooming global threat, states should be working on improving their practices and safeguards, not ‌forcing people to reveal yet more sensitive data,\" Amnesty said.\n\nIndia's IT and home ministries, which are reviewing the plan, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday about the backlash.\n\nAmnesty has in the past denounced India's surveillance practices including alleged use of Pegasus spyware to target journalists and activists -- allegations Modi's government has repeatedly denied.\n\nA fierce ⁠privacy debate erupted in India last week after ​Reuters first reported another confidential directive from the ​government to preload a state-run cyber safety app on all smartphones. India was forced to revoke the order following outcry from activists and politicians ‍over fears of snooping.\n\n\"Why ⁠are we out to convert India into a 'Surveillance State'?\" Senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala said on X, criticising the proposal to track phone locations.\n\nA large ⁠number of Indian users on X joined Surjewala and other privacy activists to condemn the plan, with ‌one user framing it as turning phones into \"digital ankle monitors\".",
