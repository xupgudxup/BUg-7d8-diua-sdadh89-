    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 16 (Reuters) - India has seized three U.S.-sanctioned tanker ships linked to Iran this month and stepped up surveillance in ‌its maritime zone to curb illicit trade, a source with direct knowledge ‌of the matter said on Monday.\n\nIndia aims to prevent its waters from being used for ship-to-ship ​transfers that obscure the origin of oil cargoes, the source added.\n\nThe seizures and heightened surveillance follow an improvement in U.S.-India relations. Washington earlier this month announced it will cut import tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50%, as New Delhi has agreed ‌to stop Russian oil imports.\n\nSanctioned ⁠vessels Stellar Ruby, Asphalt Star, and Al Jafzia frequently changed their identities to evade law enforcement by coastal states, the source ⁠said, adding that their owners were based overseas.\n\nIndian authorities said in a post on X on February 6 that they had intercepted three vessels about 100 nautical miles west ​of Mumbai ​after detecting suspicious activity involving a tanker ​in India's exclusive economic zone. ‌The post was later deleted, but the source now confirmed that the vessels had been escorted to Mumbai for further investigation.\n\nThe Indian Coast Guard has since deployed about 55 ships and 10 to 12 aircraft for round-the-clock surveillance in its maritime zones, according to the source.\n\nThe U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control last year ‌sanctioned the vessels Global Peace, Chil 1, and ​Glory Star 1 with IMO numbers identical to ​the ships captured by India.\n\nTwo ​of the three tankers are linked to Iran, with Al ‌Jafzia having carried fuel oil from Iran ​to Djibouti in ​2025 and Stellar Ruby flagged in Iran, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe Asphalt Star mostly operated on voyages around China, the data show.\n\nSanctioned oil and fuel ​are often sold at ‌deep discounts due to the risks involved, with intermediaries moving cargo through ​complex ownership structures, false documentation and mid-sea transfers that complicate enforcement.\n\n(Reporting ​by Saurabh Sharma; editing by Andrei Khalip)",

    "description": "After weeks of debate about whether Pakistan's fixture against India would go ahead at the T20 World Cup, the action failed to deliver and it left the rivalry feeling more political than sporting.",
    "fullText": "Colombo awoke to its greyest sky of the week come Sunday morning. A portent, perhaps, of the weather forecast which briefly caused a scare prior to India's dominant win over Pakistan later that evening.\n\nIt certainly mirrored the cloud lurking over the build-up to cricket's most-charged derby. Pakistan relented on their original decision to boycott the fixture in solidarity with Bangladesh, who had to forfeit their place in this T20 World Cup when refused dispensation to play their games outside of India.\n\nArguably more interest stemmed from the pageantry of Sunday's game than from the actual cricket. Plenty were on handshake-watch given recent history between these two. Polite formalities did not return at the toss, Suryakumar Yadav and Salman Ali Agha giving each other the silent treatment.\n\nTo be ready for the myriad cameras capturing the flip of the coin, both captains have to be in place a good two minutes before getting on with the ceremony. When mired in such awkwardness, it seems an eternity.\n\nEnough time for a detail-oriented TV producer to spot that Salman, Pakistan's skipper, sported a kink in his collar. The scruffy schoolboy-look was rectified by an anonymous figure inadvertently stealing the situation's authority. It certainly detracted from the attempted strong-man image projected by stubborn leaders.\n\nAs did the behaviour of the ex-pros off the pitch. On the ICC broadcast, Rohit Sharma and Wasim Akram warmly greeted before walking the tournament trophy onto the field. Away from the cameras, Harbhajan Singh, Misbah Ul-Haq and Ramiz Raja were spotted in cordial conversation in the media area.\n\nThe stadium certainly felt different to earlier World Cup matches at this venue. A perimeter was set multiple blocks from the ground. Bags were inspected long before the entrance. And again upon arrival. The Sri Lankan special task force, previously unseen at this tournament, was out in force, automatic weapons on full display.\n\nEven the price of a fake jersey among street vendors shot up amid India-Pakistan inflation. Local entrepreneurs were delighted the fixture went ahead. As were the swarming hotels. Such was the influx in India's accommodation that Mohammed Siraj could not squeeze into the lift on his morning commute.\n\nThe backdrop reflected the magnitude of the occasion, but not necessarily any tension. That didn't come until the toss. Albeit there were some murmurs of discontent at the choice of pre-match music. Indian rapper Hanumankind performed with his dance troupe and pyrotechnics aplenty.\n\nHe appeared on the soundtrack to Dhurandhar, a movie released last year, the political undertones of which were not well received in Pakistan where the film is banned. Shortly after Sunday's performance concluded, the call to prayer could be heard from a local mosque. The cricketing gods have a sense of humour.\n\nBoth camps were reluctant to really delve into the off-field narratives. \"In these games the emotions are always going to be high but we need to deal with that,\" said Salman.\n\n\"We have played enough cricket and games like this. You have to see the bigger picture and win our next game to qualify for the Super 8s.\"\n\nKishan goes crazy as India hammer Pakistan\n\nOnce the cricket finally started, Ishan Kishan's belligerent hitting delighted the Indian-heavy crowd - which, it should be said, was not at capacity. Usman Tariq's curious action, his pause akin to Jorginho's jump when taking a penalty, dominated pre-match chat. He failed to remain the protagonist of the contest itself, albeit he did cheekily bow towards Suryakumar upon dismissing the man who was filmed mimicking his ways during Indian net sessions.\n\nAt the mid-innings break, some dared to think we could have a chase on our hands with Pakistan needing 176. India's dominant powerplay, taking four wickets and conceding just 39 runs, put a swift end to such notions.\n\nThe scoreline in this match-up at T20 World Cups now reads 8-1 in favour of India. This rivalry has become political, rather than a sporting one. As tedious as the interference is, it offers more to discuss than one side consistently outclassing the other.\n\nAs if aware of this, in a lull during Pakistan's inevitable defeat, the ICC replayed the cordial exchange between Wasim and Rohit prior to the match. Aren't we all getting along just fine? Just not to the extent that players shook hands once India wrapped up their shellacking. That sign of respect continues to feel some way off.\n\n\"We see them as a team - we are not thinking about this as a rivalry or whatever,\" said India's Axar Patel.\n\n\"We are playing against one team and we are focusing on cricket. Whenever I'm playing, I'm not thinking about whatever, I treat it as one match and opponent.\"\n\nAfter the final wicket, Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube did not feel they had hit their desired workloads. The former bowled three overs in the match, the latter was not required. Out came bowling coach Morne Morkel to catch extra work with his baseball mitt. Opposition resoundingly dealt with yet more reps needed.\n\nAn apt reflection, not that it was required, of this contest's non-existent relationship with the sort of jeopardy required to make us all forget the politics.\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup Super 8s?\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nWhy is there talk about a Pakistan spinner's action?",

    "fullText": "The T20 World Cup heads into the final week of group-stage fixtures with six spots in the Super 8s still up for grabs.\n\nWest Indies were the first team to qualify for the next phase, while India joined them with victory over Pakistan later on Sunday.\n\nHere's what the remaining teams need to progress to the next stage.\n\nThe top two teams in each group - A to D - will progress to the Super 8s, which will be made up of two groups of four.\n\nIf any teams are level on points after the four group-stage fixtures, they will be separated by number of wins and then net run-rate.\n\nThe International Cricket Council has pre-determined the Super 8 groups if the eight seeded sides qualify:\n\nX Group: India (X1), Australia (X2), West Indies (X3), South Africa (X4)\n\nY Group: England (Y1), New Zealand (Y2), Pakistan (Y3), Sri Lanka (Y4)\n\nIf any of those sides do not progress, the teams who do in their place will just fill the spot.\n\nEach team plays three more matches in the Super 8s phase, facing each of the other teams in their group once.\n\nAfter those fixtures, the top two teams from each group will advance to the semi-finals, with the winner of each Super 8s group facing the runner-up from the other.\n\nRemaining games: Pakistan v Namibia (18 Feb, 09:30) and India v Netherlands (18 Feb, 13:30)\n\nDefending champions India sealed their place in the Super 8s with a comfortable 61-run win over rivals Pakistan.\n\nPakistan slipped to third with that defeat, with their net run-rate taking a heavy hit.\n\nHowever, a win in their final game against Namibia on Wednesday would see them progress.\n\nUSA have played all of their games and are currently second but need Pakistan to lose their final game and for the Netherlands to lose or not overtake their net run-rate if they win.\n\nThe Netherlands must beat India, hope Pakistan lose and then it could come down to net run-rate.\n\nRemaining games: Australia v Sri Lanka (16 Feb, 13:30), Ireland v Zimbabwe (17 Feb 09:30 GMT), Sri Lanka v Zimbabwe (19 Feb, 09:30), Australia v Oman (20 Feb, 13:30)\n\nSri Lanka will progress with a win over Australia on Monday. If they lose they would likely need to beat Zimbabwe and then it could come down to net run-rate. Two wins would guarantee progression.\n\nAustralia would be eliminated if they lose to Sri Lanka on Monday and Zimbabwe beat Ireland on Tuesday. They may need to win both their remaining games and rely on net run-rate.\n\nZimbabwe will guarantee progression with two wins. One win potentially may be enough but it would come down to net run-rate.\n\nIreland need to win their last match and hope other results go their way because they can only qualify on net run-rate.\n\nRemaining games: England v Italy (16 Feb, 09:30), Scotland v Nepal (17 Feb, 13:30), West Indies v Italy (19 Feb, 05:30)\n\nWest Indies secured their progression with a nine-wicket win over Nepal on Sunday.\n\nEngland must beat Italy on Monday to progress. A defeat would likely see them eliminated on net run-rate.\n\nScotland need to beat Nepal and hope Italy beat England but do not overtake their net run-rate.\n\nItaly must beat England but could lose to West Indies and then net run-rate would decide who progresses. Two wins would see them through, as would a win against England and a washed-out game against West Indies.\n\nRemaining games: Afghanistan v UAE (16 Feb, 05:30 GMT), New Zealand v Canada (17 Feb, 05:30 GMT), South Africa v UAE (18 Feb, 05:30 GMT), Afghanistan v Canada (19 Feb, 13:30 GMT)\n\nSouth Africa are in a strong position to progress and their spot could be sealed on Monday if UAE lose to Afghanistan. Regardless of that result, a win against UAE on Wednesday would confirm their progression.\n\nNew Zealand likely need to win and hope that UAE do not win both of their games. If both of those things happen then net run-rate would decide who moves through.\n\nUAE likely need to win both of their remaining games and even then are likely to be relying on net run-rate to progress.\n\nAfghanistan need to win both of their matches, including one against UAE, and hope that neither UAE or New Zealand pick up points in their final game.\n\nCanada need to win both their remaining fixtures and will need other results to go their way.\n\nRun-rate is the average number of runs scored per over by a team in their entire innings - so, for example, a score of 140 off 20 overs equals seven runs per over.\n\nNet run-rate is calculated by subtracting the opposition's run-rate from the other team's run-rate.\n\nThe winning side will therefore have a positive net run-rate, and the losers a negative net run-rate.\n\nIn a tournament, net run-rate is worked out by taking the average runs per over scored by that team in each game and subtracting the average runs per over scored against them in each game.\n\nIf a team is bowled out inside their allotted overs, their run-rate is calculated by dividing the runs by the maximum overs they could have batted - 20 overs in the case of this tournament.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "T20 World Cup, Group A, Colombo\n\nIndia 175-7 (20 overs): Kishan 77 (40); Ayub 3-25\n\nPakistan 114 (18 overs): Usman 44 (34); Hardik 2-16, Chakravarthy 2-17, Bumrah 2-17\n\nIndia continued their recent on-field dominance over Pakistan by winning their highly anticipated meeting in Colombo by 61 runs to confirm their place in the Super 8s of the T20 World Cup.\n\nAfter weeks of discussion and doubt over whether the match would even go ahead, India ultimately proved too strong and sealed a ninth successive win in completed matches against their rivals.\n\nAlthough the captains did not shake hands at the toss and there were no exchanges between the players after the final play, the rest of the match passed without any flashpoints amid the ongoing political tensions between the two nations and last year's military conflict.\n\nThe encounter was effectively won by a brutal early assault by India opener Ishan Kishan, who struck 77 from 40 balls on a tricky, turning pitch.\n\nIt gave co-hosts a flying start and meant, even with Pakistan's plethora of spinners slowing the scoring and taking wickets, they still posted 175-7.\n\nThat always felt a challenging total and Hardik Pandya took a wicket in the first over of the chase and Jasprit Bumrah two in the second to all but confirm the result.\n\nUsman Khan struck some blows in making 44 but Pakistan were swept aside - all out for 114 in 18 overs.\n\nWhile India are now certain to progress as they attempt to retain the title won in 2024, Pakistan must beat Namibia on Wednesday to guarantee their place in the Super 8s.\n\nShould they do so, the rivals could yet meet again in this competition in a semi-final or final.\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup Super 8s?\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nIndia-Pakistan to go ahead as government ends boycott request\n\nFor a while it looked like this match would not happen.\n\nPakistan, whose last win against India was at the Asia Cup in 2022, announced a boycott a week before the tournament began, only to reverse their decision at the start of this week after extensive talks.\n\nIt went ahead, in front of a large crowd weighted towards Indian blue, because it is the most lucrative fixture in the world game, providing the funds upon which cricket's ecosystem survives in its current imperfect state.\n\nHow long that remains the case given India's dominance, built from their cricketing and financial might, remains to be seen.\n\nKishan's assault gave India breathing space and their bowlers were ruthless, even if their fielders dropped three catches.\n\nAfter Pakistan's seamers went the distance, Hardik began with a wicket maiden - dismissing right-hander Sahibzada Farhan, who skewed a pull shot high to mid-on.\n\nIn the next over, the majestic Bumrah pinned left-hander Saim Ayub in front with full inswinger, before Pakistan Salman Agha holed out playing a wild slog.\n\nEven Pakistan's biggest name, Babar Azam, was tamely bowled for five attempting a swipe to left-arm spinner Axar Patel in the fifth over, while left-handers Mohammed Nawaz and Faheem Ashraf meekly picked out fielders in the deep.\n\nAfter all of the build-up this was another underwhelming meeting.\n\nKishan's innings was an outlier across the match. He scored at a strike-rate of 192.50 per 100 balls. Only one other batter to face more than five deliveries, Shivam Dube - who made 27 from 17 balls - went at more than 130.\n\nOf the first 88 runs in the match, 77 came off the bat of Kishan as he made his second 50 in a row at this World Cup.\n\nHe was fortunate to chip three swings into gaps but otherwise hit cleanly in all directions until he was bowled by Ayub in the ninth over.\n\nSwitching through six different spinners, Pakistan's fightback came too late with mystery spinner Usman Tariq held back too long.\n\nAyub had Tilak Verma lbw for a stodgy 25 from 24 balls before Hardik hit his next ball to long-off. Had Ayub's hat-trick ball not narrowly missed Dube's edge and stumps after turning sharply, Pakistan may have had a better chance.\n\nTheir decision to bowl first also seemed a misstep, with the ball skidding through later on.\n\nDube was left to push India beyond 150 which was probably a par total in the conditions.\n\nIn truth, little went right for Pakistan.",

    "description": "Sri Lanka braced itself for massive losses after Pakistan’s boycott calls, but now awaits a thrilling clash on Sunday.",
    "fullText": "Colombo, Sri Lanka — Almost 30 years ago today, India and Pakistan formed a combined cricket team to take on Sri Lanka ahead of the 1996 Cricket World Cup in an unprecedented moment of unity in the sport’s history.\n\nThe two age-old rivals put aside their differences and came together in an act of solidarity to support a fellow South Asian team, who faced the threat of match boycotts in a tournament they had battled hard to host.\n\nIndia versus Pakistan is the most highly marketed fixture at every multination tournament – the World Cup, Asia Cup or Asian Games – whether it’s a men’s, women’s or Under-19 event.\n\nFew sporting events globally carry the weight and anticipation of an India-Pakistan cricket match. So, when Pakistan’s government ordered its team not to face India at the ongoing T20 World Cup, the tournament was briefly pushed into a state of chaos.\n\nIt also left Sri Lanka, the designated host of the fixture, holding its collective breath.\n\nA week of negotiations led to a dramatic late U-turn by the Pakistani government and the match will now take place as scheduled on Sunday at the R Premadasa International Cricket Stadium in Colombo.\n\nBut what if the boycott had gone ahead? The impact could have been catastrophic, not just for Pakistan, but also for the International Cricket Council (ICC), as well as Sri Lanka.\n\nWith the crisis seemingly averted, the island nation stands poised to reap the benefits in its financial landscape, diplomatic standing and community.\n\nFor a country that is still grappling with the aftermath of the economic crisis of 2022, an India-Pakistan cricket fixture at a World Cup could prove to be a godsend.\n\nThe tourism and hospitality industry was one of the hardest hit during Sri Lanka’s financial meltdown and this match will see an enormous influx of fans from India and Pakistan coming into the country.\n\nHotels in and around Colombo were fully booked out well ahead of the tournament but the industry braced itself for heavy losses after Pakistan threatened a boycott.\n\n“There’s been a massive impact since the boycott was announced,” Sudarshana Pieris, who works in Sri Lanka’s hospitality sector, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“All major hotels in Colombo were fully booked by Indian travel agencies well ahead [of the match] and once the boycott was announced, we lost almost all of those bookings,” he said.\n\n“But after Pakistan reversed their decision, hotel room rates shot up by about 300-400 percent at five-star establishments in Colombo.”\n\nIt’s not just hotels but several other local businesses – from street vendors to high-end restaurants – who are hoping for an increased footfall and spending over the weekend.\n\nThese short trips and the experiences they offer could influence visitors to extend their stay or return to Sri Lanka on holiday, long after the game has ended, in a potential long-term benefit to the industry.\n\nAnother relatively underestimated impact of the game would be the employment opportunities it creates, albeit temporarily, in the media, event management, security and transportation industries.\n\nAsanka Hadirampela, a freelance journalist and broadcaster currently working as a Sinhala language commentator for the World Cup, recognises the marquee match as a great opportunity from a personal standpoint.\n\n“This is my first World Cup as a broadcaster,” Hadirampela said.\n\n“The India-Pakistan fixture is the biggest and most-watched game of the tournament. So to get to work on such a match is exciting and I consider it a special achievement.”\n\nThe lines are always blurred between sport and politics in South Asia.\n\nSo while the financial gains are expected to be significant, the fixture’s impact on the region’s geopolitical environment cannot go amiss.\n\nPakistan’s boycott, too, was explicitly political, as confirmed by the country’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif when he said that they were offering support to Bangladesh after the Tigers were kicked out of the tournament by the ICC.\n\nThe reversal of Pakistan’s decision, which they said came after requests to reconsider the boycott by several regional “friends”, was steeped in politics, too.\n\nSri Lanka’s President Anura Kumara Dissanayake reportedly had a phone conversation with PM Sharif, urging his government to rethink their decision to boycott the game as the successful staging of this encounter would not only position Sri Lanka as a capable host of global sporting events but also reinforce its standing as a neutral mediator in a region fraught with geopolitical complexities.\n\nSri Lanka and Pakistan have always maintained strong diplomatic relations, which have extended to the cricket field as well.\n\nSri Lanka were one of the first teams to travel to Pakistan following their 10-year ostracisation from international cricket, which came as a result of a terrorist attack targeting the Sri Lankan team in March 2009.\n\nWhen Al Jazeera reached out to Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), its vice president Ravin Wickramaratne confirmed that SLC did, indeed, reach out to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) after the boycott was announced.\n\n“We asked them to reconsider the decision,” Wickramaratne said.\n\n“It [boycott] would have impacted Sri Lanka economically, whether directly or indirectly.\n\n“We have always had a good relationship with the PCB and we have always supported them, so we’re happy with their decision.”\n\nA little over 24 hours ahead of the match in Colombo, there is a sense of palpable excitement and a growing buzz around the fixture as it returns from the brink of cancellation.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, 28,000 tickets had been sold for the game but local organisers expect a capacity crowd of 40,000 to make it into the stands.\n\nCome Sunday, thousands more will line the streets in and around Maligawatte, the bustling Colombo suburb that houses the famous Premadasa Stadium.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI (AP) — A coalition of major trade unions and farmers’ groups in India mounted a nationwide strike Thursday to protest an interim trade deal with the United States, saying the agreement undermines the interests of farmers, small businesses and workers.\n\nIn parliament, lawmakers from opposition political parties demanded that the government scrap the trade deal and criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the slogan “Narendra Modi, surrender Modi.”\n\nThe one-day strike partially disrupted public services and manufacturing activities, highlighting resistance to the reform agenda set by Modi, leader of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party, and underscoring the political risks of pushing market-oriented policies before key state elections later this year.\n\nIn New Delhi, a protesting farmer activist, Hannan Mollah, said that India's recent free trade agreements with New Zealand, Europe and now the U.S. were poised to ruin India's farm sector as the local markets would be inundated by cheaper products.\n\n“The fight will go on till our demands are met,\" Mollah said \"If not, the public will gather in large numbers and uproot the Modi government.\"\n\nA union leader said that the trade deal with Washington opens the Indian market to subsidized agricultural products, threatening the livelihoods of millions of small farmers.\n\n“Cheap American farm produce will be dumped in India, making it difficult for our farmers and small businesses to compete,” said Amarjeet Kaur, general-secretary of All India Trade Union Congress, a prominent union that took part in the strike.\n\nThe government in New Delhi has defended the interim trade pact as a step toward expanding exports, attracting investments and strengthening strategic ties with the U.S. The interests of farmers in the agriculture and dairy sectors were protected, Indian Trade Minister Piyush Goyal said recently.\n\nIndia and the U.S. announced this month that they were moving closer to a formal trade pact, releasing an interim framework that would lower tariffs and deepen economic ties.\n\nA fact sheet issued by the White House shows reciprocal tariff on Indian goods decreasing from 25% to 18%, while an additional 25% penalty tariff for India's purchase of Russian oil will be dropped.\n\nIn return, India will stop buying Russian oil and purchase $500 billion worth of U.S. goods, including energy, while cutting taxes and non-tariff barriers.\n\nThe protesters in India also opposed Modi’s efforts to privatize state-run companies and implement new labor codes, calling the sweeping changes “deceptive fraud” against workers.\n\nIndian officials have argued that labor reforms were needed to boost efficiency and create jobs in the long run.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 12 (Reuters) - India on Thursday gave initial clearance for a 3.6-trillion-rupee ($40 billion) boost to the country's armed forces, including procurement of more Rafale fighter ‌jets for the air force and Boeing P-8I reconnaissance aircraft for the navy.\n\nHeightened ‌tensions with its neighbours, including Pakistan, have pushed India's military to modernise.\n\nThe air force's fighter squadron strength has shrunk ​to 29 in recent months, well below the 42 it had earlier. Its workhorse MiG-21 was retired in September and other early variants of the MiG-29, the Anglo-French Jaguar and the French Mirage 2000, are also set to end service in the coming years.\n\nNew Delhi has long relied on ‌importing machinery and weapons for its ⁠armed forces, but a recent push by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has helped boost domestic manufacturing.\n\nFor the Indian Air Force, this era began in ⁠the 1980s but was fruitful only in the last decade when the locally produced Tejas fighter jet was introduced to replace Soviet-era MiG-21s.\n\nHindustan Aeronautics (HAL) has nearly 180 of the advanced Mk-1A variants of the ​Tejas ​on order domestically, but has yet to begin deliveries ​due to engine supply chain issues ‌at GE Aerospace.\n\nThe defence ministry said the Defence Acquisition Council had given the initial nod for more Rafale fighter jets and missiles for the air force, anti-tank missiles for the army and P-8I reconnaissance aircraft for its navy.\n\nThe total value of all these proposals stands at 3.6 trillion rupees, the statement said. It did not elaborate further.\n\nThe approvals come ahead of a visit ‌by French President Emmanuel Macron to India next week. ​The Indian Air Force's fleet currently includes Rafale fighters ​from Dassault Aviation.\n\nIn April, India signed ​a deal for 26 Rafale-Marine twin- and single-seat jets to be deployed on ‌its two carriers: INS Vikrant and INS ​Vikramaditya.\n\nSeparately, the defence ministry ​on Thursday also signed a deal with HAL to buy eight Dornier 228 aircraft for the coastguard.\n\nThe proposals pave the way for commercial and technical details to be ​finalized soon.\n\nEarlier in the day, ‌local media reported that the DAC had given its approval to buy 114 Rafale ​fighter jets from Dassault for 3.25 trillion rupees.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 11 (Reuters) - India's stated intention to buy $500 billion of U.S. goods over five years under a trade deal is drawing scepticism, with ‌economists warning it could distort commercial procurement and sharply reshape New Delhi's trade balance.\n\nU.S. President Donald ‌Trump last week said he will slash tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50%, sparking relief in India. But he ​asked New Delhi to more than double its annual imports of U.S. goods in return.\n\nBilateral trade was $132 billion in 2024-25, with a roughly $41 billion surplus in India's favour.\n\nTrade experts and economists questioned whether $100 billion a year in imports was feasible without an explicit policy push that steers companies towards American suppliers.\n\n\"The math doesn't add up,\" ‌said Madhavi Arora, an economist at ⁠Emkay Global, calling the target more \"aspirational than realistic\".\n\nA joint statement issued by the two nations said India intends to buy $500 billion of U.S. goods - language that stops ⁠short of a binding commitment.\n\nBut Trump has shown little patience with countries that fall short, including a late-January move to raise tariffs on some South Korean goods back to 25% from 15% after saying Seoul failed to legislate ​an ​earlier deal.\n\nIndia aims to step up procurement of oil, ​gas, coking coal and aircraft from the U.S., ‌both nations said in the joint statement.\n\nArora cautioned such targets can imply a government nudge to private airline and corporate sourcing decisions, which may be inefficient.\n\nWhile India has cited large Boeing orders as part of the plan, some analysts say firms could still favour Airbus if commercial terms are better.\n\nIndian markets steadied after staging an initial relief rally, but economists said investors appear wary of the $500 billion headline.\n\n\"The markets seem ‌to be treating the $500 billion purchase intention with a ​degree of scepticism,\" said Dhiraj Nim, an economist at ANZ.\n\nThe U.S. is India's top export destination, ​accounting for nearly a fifth of the Asian nation's entire shipments in the fiscal ‌year 2024-25.\n\nIf exports hold near pre-tariff levels ​and imports rise sharply, India's ​largest bilateral surplus could shrink and widen its overall trade deficit. India had a total goods trade deficit of $283.5 billion in 2024-25.\n\n\"If it is a $100 billion every year, it will completely upset ​India's trade balance,\" said independent trade ‌expert Biswajit Dhar.",

    "description": "The United States and India have released an interim framework for a trade deal, paving the way for an agreement that would lower",
    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 9 (Reuters) - The United States and India have released an interim framework for a trade deal, paving the way for an agreement that would lower tariffs, reconfigure energy ties and deepen economic cooperation ​as both seek to realign global supply chains.\n\nThe India–U.S. joint statement suggested that New Delhi pushed back against Washington's efforts to ‌broadly open its agricultural market. However, India has agreed to lower trade barriers on some farm goods, drawing criticism from farmers and opposition parties.\n\nWHO GAINS FROM INDIA'S DECISION TO ALLOW ‌IMPORTS OF DDGS AND SOYOIL, AND WHO LOSES OUT?\n\nIndia is expected to allow imports of protein-rich distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), a byproduct of ethanol made from corn and other grains, from the United States, adding to a surplus in the domestic market.\n\nHigher supplies of DDGS could benefit India's nearly $30 billion poultry sector, where feed costs account for around 60-70% of total production expenses, by helping reduce expensive feed purchases.\n\nDomestic oilseed processors and soybean farmers, however, may ⁠lose out if U.S. imports rise.\n\nThere are already ‌surplus supplies of DDGS in India, weakening demand for oilmeals such as soyameal, putting pressure on Indian oilseed prices and prompting farmers to switch from soybean and peanuts to corn and rice, despite New Delhi's push to boost ‍oilseed cultivation and curb imports.\n\nAs supplies of DDGS increase further, India's ethanol producers - already struggling with idle capacity and slowing demand after the country achieved its 20% biofuel blending target - may face lower earnings from DDGS sales in the domestic market.\n\nProspects of duty-free imports of soyoil from the U.S. have raised some concerns in India. ​But, under the current framework, duty-free soyoil imports will be allowed only under a tariff-rate quota, meaning volumes above the quota will face ‌standard tariffs, a move aimed at protecting domestic producers.\n\nWILL DUTY-FREE COTTON IMPORTS AFFECT INDIAN FARMERS?\n\nIndia currently imposes an 11% duty on cotton imports, and allowing duty-free imports from the world's largest exporter of the fiber could put pressure on domestic prices.\n\nHowever, the impact is expected to be limited, as the government has permitted only imports of extra-long staple cotton, and that too under a quota.\n\nAlthough India is the world's second-largest cotton producer, it struggles to meet the textile industry's demand for extra-long staple cotton, which it imports from the U.S., Egypt, Brazil and Australia.\n\nDO CONCESSIONAL IMPORTS OF APPLES ⁠AND DRY FRUITS THREATEN INDIAN FARMERS?\n\nIndia is the world's fifth-largest apple producer, but domestic ​supplies fall short of rising demand, driven by population growth and increasing prosperity.\n\nNew Delhi ​imports around 500,000 metric tons of apples annually from Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan, the U.S. and Chile. Under a trade deal with the U.S., imports will be allowed at a concessional duty of 25% and a minimum import price of 80 ‍rupees per kg, effectively preventing shipments ⁠below 100 rupees per kg and helping protect Indian farmers.\n\nConsumption of dry fruits such as walnuts, almonds and pistachios has also been rising in India. Domestic production of these commodities is limited, so concessional imports are unlikely to affect local farmers.\n\nARE INDIAN FARMERS LIKELY ⁠TO BENEFIT FROM THE TRADE DEAL?\n\nIndian growers of tea, coffee, spices and fruits are set to gain from the trade deal, as the U.S. has granted duty-free access for ‌these products.\n\nThe reduction of import duties on rice to 18% is also expected to support exporters of both premium basmati and ‌non-basmati varieties.",

    "fullText": "Bangladesh have requested that Pakistan end their planned boycott of their T20 World Cup match against India, opening the door for the fixture to be played on 15 February as scheduled.\n\nThe match, the biggest and most lucrative in cricket, has been in doubt since the Pakistan government advised its team not to take the field against their long-time rivals.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that initial decision was made to \"support\" Bangladesh, who had a request for their matches to be moved out of India rejected and subsequently pulled out of the tournament.\n\nBut, after talks between officials at the Pakistan Cricket Board, the International Cricket Council and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) in Lahore on Sunday, BCB president Ameenul Islam requested the match go ahead \"for the benefit of the entire cricket ecosystem\".\n\n\"We are deeply moved by Pakistan's efforts to go above and beyond in supporting Bangladesh during this period. Long may our brotherhood flourish,\" he added.\n\nThe match is scheduled to take place in the city of Colombo in Sri Lanka, the co-hosts for the tournament with India.\n\nPakistan will forfeit the points from the group-stage match should it not be played but the team's absence from the tournament would also have longer-term consequences for cricket.\n\nIt could lead to disputes over the ICC's current rights deals and continued uncertainty would likely impact future agreements, with the current TV deals set to run out after the 2027 World Cup.\n\nMany of the smaller cricketing nations rely on the money distributed by the ICC, so any cut in revenue would likely hit such countries hardest.\n\n\"Following my short visit to Pakistan yesterday and given the forthcoming outcomes of our discussions, I request Pakistan to play the ICC T20 World Cup game on 15 February against India for the benefit of the entire cricket ecosystem,\" Islam said.\n\nWhile stopping short of confirming the match will go ahead, the ICC released a statement on Monday evening confirming Bangladesh will not be sanctioned for their boycott.\n\nIt also said Bangladesh will host an ICC event between 2028 and the start of the 2031 World Cup.\n\n\"The ICC, PCB and BCB, along with other members, remain committed to continued dialogue, cooperation and constructive engagement in the best interests of the sport,\" a statement said.\n\n\"All stakeholders acknowledge that the spirit of this understanding is to protect the integrity of the game and preserve unity within the cricket fraternity.\"\n\nThere were no details on what event Bangladesh would host. All men's events have been confirmed up until 2031, with Bangladesh already scheduled to co-host the 2031 World Cup with India.\n\nThe hosts of women's tournaments have been chosen up to 2027, while the ICC also holds Under-19 World Cups.\n\nThe PCB has been contacted for comment.\n\nWhat next in Pakistan-India controversy as ICC confirm forfeit stance?",

    "description": "India has scrapped a planned concession for small cars in upcoming fuel-efficiency rules after automakers including Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra",
    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 9 (Reuters) - India has scrapped a planned concession for small cars in upcoming fuel-efficiency rules after automakers including Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra argued ​it would benefit only one company, a government document shows.\n\nA September draft had proposed leniency ‌for petrol cars weighing 909 kg (2,004 lb) or less - a carve-out widely seen as favouring Maruti Suzuki, which controls 95% of ‌India's small‑car market.\n\nIndia's Power Ministry has now removed that exemption and tightened other parameters, increasing pressure on all automakers to ramp up electric and hybrid car sales, according to the latest 41-page draft reviewed by Reuters.\n\nThe new rules curb over-compensation for vehicle weight, aim to level the field between light and heavy fleet ⁠manufacturers, and are designed to deliver ‌real-world efficiency gains, the document said.\n\nThey introduce \"a substantially steeper reduction pathway\" for emissions, it added.\n\nThe power ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPROMOTING ELECTRIC, HYBRID ‍MODELS\n\nTransport accounts for about 12% of India's energy use and is a major driver of petroleum imports and carbon emissions. Passenger vehicles make up nearly 90% of transport-related emissions, the document says.\n\nCorporate Average Fuel Efficiency norms dictate permissible ​CO2 emissions across a manufacturer's fleet of passenger cars weighing less than 3,500 kg (7,716 lb). Updated ‌every five years, they push automakers towards cleaner technologies including electrification, compressed natural gas and flex-fuel.\n\nThe new rules will apply from April 2027 for five years and are central to automakers' product and powertrain investment plans. It was not immediately clear when the rules will be finalised.\n\nThe September draft would have allowed fuel-consumption targets to rise faster with vehicle weight, easing compliance for makers of heavier cars such as ⁠Mahindra, Tata and Volkswagen, while tightening demands on lighter-fleet players ​such as Maruti. That imbalance prompted the carve-out.\n\nThe revised plan ​reduces the extent to which heavier vehicles gain more relaxed targets.\n\n\"Manufacturers with heavier fleets ... are required to achieve stronger intrinsic efficiency improvements,\" the document said.\n\nA credit system will ‍reward companies that sell more ⁠EVs and plug-in hybrids, and pooling of fuel-consumption performance between companies will be allowed. Non-compliance will draw penalties of up to $550 per car.\n\nThe revised plan aims to cut average fleet emissions ⁠to about 100 grams/km over the five years to March 2032 from 114 grams/km. With credits, that could fall to ‌as low as 76 grams/km if electric models reach 11% of total car sales ‌by 2032.",

    "fullText": "Whether it be the unforgettable St. Patrick's Day against Pakistan in 2007, or Kevin O'Brien thumping a rapid century to beat England four years later, Ireland's history at World Cups is one built upon giant killings.\n\nBut if those historic days, and a few more besides against the likes of West Indies, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh, all helped to create a reputation for over-performance at global showpieces, it has been a contrasting story at T20 World Cups.\n\nIndeed, as Ireland prepare to start their 2026 campaign against co-hosts Sri Lanka on Sunday, the presence of Oman in their group is a reminder that in the shorter format, the shoe has more often been on the other foot.\n\nIt was 10 years ago in India that defeat by the tournament debutants first up sent Ireland on their way to one of their six early exits from eight attempts, while it was the same old story in the USA last time around when a 12-run loss to Canada, with an assist from the weather, did the damage.\n\nWith Australia to follow Sri Lanka this time around, before facing Oman and then Zimbabwe in Pool B, if Heinrich Malan's side are to reverse the trend in the coming 10 days, they must ensure they are again the ones administering the shocks rather than finding themselves on the receiving end.\n\nSaturday, 8 February 2026, 13:30 GMT\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live text with in-play clips.\n\nWhile Ireland lost three of their six scheduled T20s to the weather during a wholly frustrating home summer in 2025, in the months since they have at least had the benefit of regular cricket.\n\nHarry Tector and Matthew Humphreys led the way for an encouraging T20 win over Bangladesh in November before consecutive losses to surrender the series gave the impression of a side who had run out of steam at the end of the multi-format tour.\n\nA 2-1 series win over Italy followed by a two-game whitewash of the UAE have formed the bulk of preparations for the World Cup, but a final tune-up against Pakistan on Wednesday fell victim to the rain, robbing the side of the chance to step up against the sort of superior opposition they will face in their first two games in Sri Lanka.\n\nAcross the five warm-up games in Dubai, there is the sense that the side have chanced upon their optimum line-up for the conditions in Sri Lanka, although perhaps the solution involved the loss of form one of their leading lights.\n\nTector and Humphreys continue to lead the way with bat and ball respectively, with the former averaging 43 across his past eight T20 internationals to form a strong middle-order with wicket-keeper Lorcan Tucker.\n\nRoss Adair, who still has Ireland's most recent T20 century to his name thanks to his knock against South Africa in 2024, appears to have held off the challenge of the younger Tector brother, Tim, to open alongside captain Paul Stirling.\n\nDespite the skipper averaging 20 across the 16 T20s Ireland have played since the last World Cup, the 35-year-old remains the side's best player against the spin bowling they are sure to face in Sri Lankan conditions.\n\nThe bowling resurgence of veteran all-rounder George Dockrell - who took four wickets for 53 runs from 13 overs in the warm-ups - allows for the lengthening of the batting line-up where 23-year-old Ben Calitz will be relied upon to provide some left-handed thump.\n\nIt is all, however, expected to be at the expense of a genuine quick. An out-of-sorts Josh Little did not feature in either match against the UAE after not managing a wicket in two games against both Bangladesh and Italy with an economy rate ranging between 9.50 and 13.50.\n\nThe player who took a memorable T20 World Cup hat-trick against New Zealand in 2022, and indeed had figures of 4-23 against Sunday's opposition a year prior, looks likely to start the tournament outside the starting XI.\n\nWith Mark Adair, Ireland's leading T20 wicket-taker there to shoulder the load in terms of seam, it means Malan's selection can all, in one way or another, take some confidence from their preparations.\n\nWhether that transfers to facing the likes of Sri Lanka and Australia, however, will be the determining factor in Ireland's efforts.\n\nAustralia's Hazlewood ruled out of T20 World Cup\n\nScotland beaten by West Indies in T20 World Cup opener\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "India 161-9 (20 overs): Suryakumar 84*; Van Schalkwyk 4-25\n\nUSA 132-8 (20 overs): Ranjane 37, Krishnamurthi 37; Siraj 3-29\n\nSuryakumar Yadav rescued India from an almighty scare and ensured the T20 World Cup co-hosts opened their tournament with a 29-run victory over the United States in Mumbai.\n\nAfter being put into bat the defending champions and overwhelming favourites slumped to 77-6, putting them at risk of the biggest shock in cricket history – and one of the biggest upsets in any sport.\n\nBut the US crucially dropped Suryakumar on 15. Bowler Shubham Ranjane, one of five India-born players in USA's XI, was the guilty party low in his follow-through.\n\nThe India captain punished the miss with a brilliant 84 not out from 49 balls, countering the situation perfectly by starting slowly before unfurling thrilling scoops and flicks to drag the hosts to 161-9.\n\nThat denied the underdogs any momentum and India seamers Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Siraj took three wickets in the first four overs of the chase to reduce the US to 13-3.\n\nAs the required run-rate climbed, the expectant locals grew more comfortable and the US scrapped to 132-8 in their 20 overs without ever threatening to complete the chase.\n\nIt means, after an entertaining opening day in which the Netherlands were a dropped catch away from stunning Pakistan and Scotland threatened West Indies, India set the early pace at the top of Group A as expected in this World Cup.\n\nEngland enter the tournament on Sunday with a fixture against Nepal at 09:30 GMT. Ireland play Sri Lanka in Colombo at 13:30.\n\nT20 World Cup: India seal opening-day win over USA - reaction\n\nIndia's margin of victory was, in the end, comfortable.\n\nMake no mistake, however. The upset, which would have topped USA's super over win over Pakistan at the last T20 World Cup, was on at one stage.\n\nThe home crowd was quiet and in the 13th over Suryakumar and Axar Patel were at the crease with only three tailenders remaining.\n\nThe US, who have not played a T20 since April amid governance issues and are ranked 18th in the world, bowled superbly.\n\nIndia opener Abhishek Sharma, many people's tip for player of the tournament, slashed his first ball to deep cover and when South Africa-born seamer Shadley van Schalkwyk mixed his pace to take three wickets in the sixth over, including Tilak Verma and Shivam Dube in consecutive deliveries, the hosts were 46-4.\n\nSuryakumar - known by his nickname SKY - defended Van Schalkwyk's hat-trick ball and took only five runs from his first 10 deliveries and 20 from his first 21.\n\nHis team-mates all struggled to time the ball but he took time to feel comfortable, putting on 41 with Axar.\n\nMaking the most of the reprieve by Ranjane, Suryakumar was playing trademark sweeps off seamers for six and tumbling scoops by the end with the US hurt by the loss of Ali Khan to injury with two of his overs unbowled.\n\nIndia's captain took 20 runs from the last over, meaning he ended the innings with 10 runs more than the 74 his team-mates managed combined.\n\nIt was a spectacular and much-needed knock.\n\nT20 World Cup: India seal opening-day win over USA - reaction\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "Still two-years younger than what Sachin Tendulkar's age was at the time of his India debut, he has a bat-swing that reminds of Brian Charles Lara, Harmanpreet Kaur, and Yuvraj Singh, and like footballer Lamine Yamal, who has emerged as a teenage sensation at the highest level, Sooryavanshi’s age has rarely matched the stage he performs on.",
    "fullText": "Conventional wisdom suggests that a 13-year-old would struggle to even face deliveries bowled at speeds above 90 mph. Vaibhav Sooryavanshi has challenged that assumption by striking bowlers such as Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna and Jofra Archer to all parts of the ground.\n\nIn traditional cricket coaching, batters are taught to keep their hands close to the body during the backlift to maintain control over the bat swing. Sooryavanshi differs here as well. His backlift moves away from the body, going against what is often described as textbook technique.\n\nStill two-years younger than what Sachin Tendulkar's age was at the time of his India debut, he has a bat-swing that reminds of Brian Charles Lara, Harmanpreet Kaur, and Yuvraj Singh; and like footballer Lamine Yamal, who has emerged as a teenage sensation at the highest level, Sooryavanshi’s age has rarely matched the stage and level he performs on.\n\nTalent could never be the question with Vaibhav Sooryavanshi. It never was. With the 80-ball 175 knock against England in the Under-19 World Cup final on Friday, he also put to rest any talks of temperament too, with delivering on the biggest of stages.\n\nSooryavanshi produced what can be counted among the most dominant innings in Under-19 World Cup history. His 175, which included 15 sixes, helped India post 411 for 9 against England in the final at Harare.\n\nEngland, under pressure after Sooryavanshi’s innings, were bowled out for 311 in 40.2 overs while chasing a target of 412 against India’s bowling attack.\n\nThe 14-year-old reached his century in 55 balls, becoming the second-fastest centurion in the history of the Under-19 World Cup.\n\nHis innings is the highest individual score in an Under-19 World Cup final and came in the match that also produced the highest team total in a final of the tournament.\n\nSooryavanshi reached his first fifty in 32 balls and continued at the same pace against the England bowlers. His second fifty came off 23 balls.\n\nOut of his 175 runs, 150 came through boundaries, with 15 sixes and an equal number of fours. During this phase, India’s scoring rate stayed close to 10 runs an over, and the projected total crossed 500 midway through the innings.\n\nHe now holds the record for most sixes in a Youth ODI innings, surpassing his own mark of 14 sixes against UAE at ICCA Dubai in December.\n\nSooryavanshi also owns the record for the fastest 150 in Under-19 cricket, reaching the mark in 71 balls. The previous record was held by England’s Ben Mayes, who took 98 balls against Scotland at the same venue earlier in the tournament.\n\nVedant Trivedi, batting at the other end, faced only four deliveries between Sooryavanshi’s 100 and 150, underlining the speed at which the runs were scored.\n\nSooryavanshi first came into wider attention in November 2024 when he became the youngest player to receive an IPL contract after Rajasthan Royals signed him for Rs 1.10 crore. He was 13 years and 243 days old at the time. By then, he had already represented India Under-19 and scored a century as an opener against Australia Under-19 in a four-day match in Chennai.\n\nOne of the early highlights of his career was the 58-ball century against Australia Under-19, where he scored 104. At 13 years and 187 days, he became the youngest player to score a century in youth cricket, breaking the previous record held by Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto.\n\nIn the following months, Sooryavanshi continued to add records. On April 19, 2025, he made his IPL debut for Rajasthan Royals against Lucknow Super Giants, hitting Shardul Thakur for a six over extra cover off his first ball. He scored 34 off 20 balls in that match.\n\nIn his third IPL appearance, he scored a 35-ball century against Gujarat Titans, whose bowling attack included Mohammed Siraj, Ishant Sharma and Rashid Khan. The hundred was the second-fastest in IPL history, behind only Chris Gayle’s 30-ball century in 2013.\n\nIn July 2025, Sooryavanshi recorded the fastest Youth ODI century at the time, reaching the milestone in 52 balls. That record was later broken by Pakistan’s Sameer Minhas, who scored a century off 42 balls against Zimbabwe Under-19.\n\nHe was named Bihar’s vice-captain for the first two rounds of the 2025–26 Ranji Trophy season in October. The decision followed his performances on India Under-19's tour of Australia, where he provided quick starts and scored a 78-ball century in the first four-day match in Brisbane. He finished as the second-highest run-scorer of the series, with 133 runs in three innings as India won 2-0.\n\nIn November 2025, Sooryavanshi scored 144 off 42 balls for India A against UAE in the Asia Cup Rising Stars. His century came off 32 balls and was then the joint-third fastest by an Indian in men’s T20 cricket.\n\nA few weeks later, he scored 171 off 95 balls against UAE Under-19 in the opening match of the Under-19 Asia Cup.\n\nAt 14 years and 272 days, Sooryavanshi became the youngest player to score a century in men’s List A cricket. He achieved the feat while playing for Bihar against Arunachal Pradesh in the 2025–26 Vijay Hazare Trophy. He reached his century in 36 balls, later scoring the fastest 150 in men’s List A cricket off 59 balls. He was dismissed for 190 off 84 balls, which included 16 fours and 15 sixes.\n\nSooryavanshi scored 439 runs and took 1 wicket in the Under-19 World Cup and was named Player of the Tournament after India won their sixth Under-19 World Cup title on Friday.\n\n\"I had faith in my skills that I can contribute in big games and today it happened,\" Sooryavanshi said at the post-match presentation.\n\nAt 14, Sooryavanshi is already a world champion. He has delivered on most opportunities given to him so far. But he's still a kid. It's important to give him space and not put too many expectations on him. Leave him freely and watch him take the cricketing world by storm.",

Netherlands are a good side, but we want to execute our plans.”\n\nThe Netherlands has a history of surprising stronger opposition in T20 World Cups, including beating South Africa in 2022 in Australia which cleared the way for Pakistan to qualify for the semifinals.\n\nCaptain Scott Edwards said his team had got used to the conditions after spending more than a month in India and Sri Lanka.\n\n“For us, it’s a big game, so are the other three,” Edwards said.\n\nIn the two other games on Saturday, Scotland, which replaced Bangladesh in Group C, will meet two-time champion West Indies in Kolkata while co-host and defending champion India plays against the U.S. at Mumbai in a Group A match.\n\nNetherlands: Michael Levitt, Max O’Dowd, Bas de Leede, Colin Ackermann, Scott Edwards (captain), Zach Lion-Cachet, Logan van Beek, Roelof van der Merwe, Aryan Dutt, Kyle Klein, Paul van Meekeren.\n\nPakistan: Saim Ayub, Sahibzada Farhan, Salman Ali Agha (captain), Babar Azam, Usman Khan, Shadab Khan, Mohammad Nawaz, Faheem Ashraf, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Salman Mirza, Abrar Ahmed.\n\nAP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",

    "fullText": "It is almost time for the 2026 ICC Men's T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.\n\nIndia head into the tournament as defending champions following their success in the Caribbean and United States in 2024.\n\nThey are strong favourites in their home conditions - but the unpredictable nature of T20 cricket makes for an exciting tournament.\n\nHere is a full guide to the 10th edition of the men's 20-over global showpiece.\n\nThe 2026 Men's T20 World Cup starts on 7 February at 05:30 GMT with Pakistan facing the Netherlands in Colombo.\n\nIt is one of three games on the opening day, with the West Indies v Scotland at 09:30 and India v USA at 15:30.\n\nThe initial 20-team group stage, that sees four groups of five, continues until 20 February, with three games every day at the same times as above, bar the final day when there is just one game at 13:30.\n\nThe Super 8s follow with one or two games a day at 09:30 and 13:30, before the semi-finals across 4 and 5 March.\n\nThe final is on Sunday, 8 March at 13:30 BST in Ahmedabad.\n\nFull T20 World Cup fixture list including start times and venues\n\nThe 2026 Men's T20 World Cup follows the same format as 2024, which was the tournament's biggest with 20 sides taking part.\n\nAll of the teams are involved from the off in an initial group stage, with each side playing four games and the top two progressing to the Super 8s.\n\nThe Super 8s, which will take place across India and Sri Lanka, will consist of two groups of four, with eight sides seeded to help with the planning and schedule.\n\nThose eight sides are: Australia, India, South Africa, West Indies (Group 1) and England, New Zealand, Pakistan and Sri Lanka (Group 2).\n\nShould those sides progress they will go into their respective group based on their seeding, rather than their finishing position in the initial group phase.\n\nIn the Super 8s, the top two teams progress to the semi-finals with the winner of each group facing the runner-up in the other.\n\nThroughout both phases teams are awarded two points for a win, one for a no result and zero for a loss. There's no ties in T20 cricket - more on that below!\n\nAll 12 Test-playing nations have qualified for the tournament after Zimbabwe came through their qualifying stage.\n\nItaly are the only tournament debutants, while Canada are at their first global tournament since 2014.\n\nScotland were a late replacement for Bangladesh, who pulled out of the tournament after the governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), refused to meet their request to play their matches in Sri Lanka rather than India due to safety concerns amid rising tensions between the two countries.\n\nScotland, who were the highest-ranked side to not qualify, took Bangladesh's place in Group C and will fulfill their fixtures as scheduled.\n\nPakistan also considered a full boycott, but their government has decided it can play in the tournament, apart from the game against India on 15 February. The impact of that decision is yet to be communicated by the ICC.\n\nThey will play their games in Sri Lanka as part of an agreement reached in 2024 around India and Pakistan matches not being played in the other country.\n\nThe 20 sides are split into the following four groups in the initial phase:\n\nGroup A: India (X1), Namibia, Netherlands, Pakistan (Y3), USA\n\nGroup B: Australia (X2), Ireland, Oman, Sri Lanka (Y4), Zimbabwe\n\nGroup C: England (Y1), Italy, Nepal, Scotland, West Indies (X3)\n\nGroup D: Afghanistan, Canada, New Zealand (Y2), South Africa (X4), United Arab Emirates\n\nFull squad lists for the 2026 Men's T20 World Cup\n\nA total of eight venues are being used - five in India and three in Sri Lanka.\n\nIn India, Eden Gardens in Kolkata, Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad and Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi will host games.\n\nR Premadasa Stadium and Sinhalese Sports Club Ground - both in Colombo - and Pallekele Cricket Stadium put on matches in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Narendra Modi Stadium, which holds 132,000 fans and is the biggest cricket venue in the world, is due to host the final, unless Pakistan qualify, with the game then moved to Colombo.\n\nThe tournament is played in a T20 format, so both teams will face 20 overs unless they are bowled out beforehand or the team batting second reaches their target before then.\n\nEach innings will start with a six-over powerplay and there are different fielding restrictions in that phase.\n\nMatches should last three hours and 10 minutes, with each innings allocated one hour and 25 minutes and separated by a 20-minute interval.\n\nIn limited-overs cricket there is a 'stop-clock' meaning the bowling side must be ready to bowl each over within 60 seconds of the previous one finishing.\n\nEach side will be allowed two unsuccessful reviews per innings.\n\nShould the number of runs scored by each team be level after 20 overs, the match will go to a super over (each team will face six balls - highest score wins). If that finishes a tie then super overs will continue to be played until a winner is found.\n\nIn the two group phases a minimum of five overs per side must be played to constitute a result, but that rises to 10 overs in the semi-finals and final.\n\nIf a match is halted after that point due to weather conditions then DLS (Duckworth Lewis Stern method) will be used to decide the winner.\n\nThe ICC are yet to publish playing conditions around reserve days and extra time allocated to the knockout matches.\n\nIf Pakistan reach the semi-finals, Colombo's R. Premadasa Stadium will replace Kolkata as the venue for the first semi-final, while the final would also move if Pakistan qualify.\n\nIf India make the last four and face any side that is not Pakistan, they will play in the second semi-final in Mumbai on 5 March.\n\nGlossary of cricket terms including DLS and powerplay\n\nThere have been six winners of the nine Men's T20 World Cups. They are:\n\nThere will be ball-by-ball commentary of all 55 matches across BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nOur commentary team includes Henry Moeran, Prakash Wakankar, Aatif Nawaz, Daniel Norcross, Simon Mann, Nikesh Rughani, Kevin Howells and Melissa Story.\n\nExpert analysis will come from multiple Ashes winner Steven Finn, World Cup winner Alex Hartley, T20 World Cup champion Dawid Malan, Scotland and England T20 World Cup spinner Kirstie Gordon, former Ireland wicketkeeper Niall O'Brien and Big Bash winner Michael Carberry.\n\nThe BBC Sport website and app will have live text commentary on selected group-stage matches then every match from the Super 8s onwards.\n\nThere will be daily reports and score updates alongside in-play and post-match video highlights, alongside regular coverage on the BBC Cricket Instagram, external account.\n\nThe tournament is available to watch live in the UK on Sky Sports.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

South Africa's Jorich van Schalkwyk (215 vs Zimbabwe) is the only player to make a double century.\n\nIt was the sixth-highest individual score in the history of all matches played at U19 World Cups.\n\nHis knock included the record for most sixes (15) in a youth ODI innings, beating his own record of 14 against the United Arab Emirates at last year's U19 Asia Cup.\n\nHis 15 sixes is the highest number in an Under-19 World Cup innings. Only two other players have managed double digits.\n\nThe century off 55 balls is the second fastest in U19 World Cups, behind Will Malajczuk's 51-ball hundred for Australia against Japan earlier in this year's tournament\n\nIt is the latest achievement for Suryavanshi, who shot to global fame in April last year when he smashed his first ball in the Indian Premier League for six.\n\nHe then became the youngest player to hit a century in men's T20s when he made a 35-ball hundred for Rajasthan Royals against Gujarat Titans.\n\nIt was also the second-fastest century in IPL history, behind Chris Gayle's 30-ball ton in 2013.\n\nIn July 2025, he struck what was then the fastest recorded century in a youth ODI, making 143 from 78 balls as India beat England by 55 runs at Worcester.\n\nHe took 52 balls to reach three figures, bettering Kamran Ghulam's 53-ball effort for Pakistan against England in 2013.\n\nFour months later, he struck a 32-ball century in India A's victory against the United Arab Emirates in their Asia Cup Rising Stars T20 match. He was eventually dismissed for 144 from 42 balls.\n\nListen to ball-by-ball commentary of the final on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "With the T20 World Cup beginning on Saturday, BBC Sport looks at the trends and tactics from the global game that may play a part in India and Sri Lanka.",
    "fullText": "It may be just 19 months since India lifted the T20 World Cup in Barbados but the latest edition begins in Colombo on Saturday.\n\nAs ever, the tournament in India and Sri Lanka will likely be one of sixes and runs.\n\nBefore it all begins, we have taken a look at what has been going on in international and franchise games over recent years and predicted some trends and tactics to watch out for...\n\nThe option for a team to call in a batter who is struggling and chewing up too many balls has always been there.\n\n2025 was the year retiring batters out hit the mainstream.\n\nThere were 26 instances of that 'dismissal' in international and domestic T20s last year - almost 50% of the total number in the history of the format.\n\nIt has also happened twice more since the turn of the year in the Big Bash, while Northern Districts retired out two batters in the same innings in New Zealand's Super Smash in January.\n\nA batter has retired out in a T20 World Cup before - in a match involving England no less - when Namibia batter Nikolaas Davin walked off to allow David Wiese to come to the middle in the 2024 group stage.\n\nBut with the stigma around the move gone, could this be the tournament of the retired out?\n\nNot since 2013 have spinners bowled as much at the death in T20s as they did in 2025.\n\nFor a long while, the death overs - regarded as the last five in an innings for this data - have been left largely to seamers and their mix of yorkers, slower balls and hard lengths. That is changing.\n\nIn 2025, 24% of balls bowled at the death in T20s between full member nations were delivered by spinners - and with some success.\n\nSpinners' economy rate at the death has dropped around 1.5 runs per over in the past two years to 7.68 runs per over. Last year, spinners had a better economy at the finish than seamers.\n\nAfghanistan, unsurprisingly given the quality of their options, have used spin regularly at the death. More than half of their deliveries in the final five overs were bowled by spinners.\n\nIndia were the next most frequent users of the tactic, followed by Sri Lanka and, interestingly, England.\n\nWhile England captain and when leading Northern Superchargers in The Hundred since 2024, Harry Brook has had spinners bowling 42.2% of his deliveries at the death.\n\nFormer captain Jos Buttler's figure in that time was just 19.7%.\n\nThis may be less of a surprise, given fast scoring and six-hitting has been on an upward trajectory since T20's inception.\n\nLast year was a big jump, however, with batting strike-rates for all players in all men's T20s tipping over 130 for the first time. The increase from 2024 was more than eight runs per 100 balls.\n\nThe introduction of the Indian Premier League's player impact rule has boosted scoring rates there - teams effectively can field an extra batter when needed - but the rise is reflected in internationals too.\n\nA six was also hit every 17.4 deliveries across all T20s last year - the figure was at 23.1 as recently as 2021.\n\nSixes are now hit more than twice as often than in the format's first year in 2003.\n\nWe are all familiar with the term match-up these days.\n\nIt has become commonplace in T20 - and increasingly in Test cricket - and describes how some batters are suited to styles of bowling and vice-versa.\n\nWhen it comes to batting against spin, the logic goes that batters are more vulnerable when facing a bowler who turns the ball away from them - a leg-spinner to right-handers and off-spinner to left-handers.\n\nWhat is interesting, however, is how all of those at the top of the T20 batting rankings, bar Australia's openers Mitchell Marsh and Travis Head as shown below, all have strong records against their perceived negative spin match-up.\n\nIndia's left-handed opener Abhishek Sharma, the world's leading T20 batter, averages 43.3 and strikes at 183.1 runs per 100 balls against off-spin in internationals since the start of 2024.\n\nEngland right-handers Phil Salt and Buttler have strike-rates of 148.4 and 136.8 respectively against left-arm spin alongside solid averages.\n\nThe trend is reflected by the leading spin bowlers too. India's Varun Chakravarthy, Rashid Khan and Adil Rashid all have similar records against right and left-handers.\n\nWhen it gets to the elite level, match-ups are not insignificant but they are not the be all and end all.\n\nAnother thing on the rise is the prevalence of left-handed batters.\n\nIn T20s between full member nations, lefties have never faced a higher percentages of deliveries than the 35% they did in 2025.\n\nThe spike is a sign of some teams switching on to the benefits of right-hand-left-hand batting combinations.\n\nIt makes shorter boundaries harder to defend, messes with bowlers' lengths and negates the threat of those spinning match-ups.\n\nAnd no team uses this more than co-hosts and overwhelming favourites India. It has been a cornerstone of Gautam Gambhir's time as coach.\n\nSince the start of 2024, left-handers have faced 51% of India's deliveries in T20s against full members - a jump from 31% under Rahul Dravid in the run up to the 2024 World Cup.\n\nEngland, in comparison, twice picked a team with only one left-hander in their XI during the tour of India last year.\n\nBut while left-handers only faced 19% of England's deliveries from the start of 2024 to the start of 2026, the selection of Ben Duckett, Jacob Bethell and Sam Curran for this World Cup - all of whom could bat in the top seven - suggests times may, belatedly, be changing.\n\nBut if England are to have any chance in India and Sri Lanka, it feels like Salt and Buttler, their two leading batters, will have to hit form.\n\nAfter Buttler's period at number three, the pair were reunited as openers at the end of last summer and, despite a quiet run for Salt in Sri Lanka, have returned impressive results.\n\nSalt hit scores of 141 not out, 85 and 89 against South Africa and Ireland. Buttler also made 83 against South Africa when an opening stand of 126 sent England on their way to a record 304-2.\n\nSalt, a notoriously aggressive starter, cuts loose from the start, striking at 149.7 in the first two overs of T20s since the start of 2024 - the third best of any opener at this World Cup.\n\nButtler, in comparison, has a strike-rate of just 105 in that time. He sits back and watches Salt do his thing.\n\nBut by the final two overs of the powerplay Buttler is often flying.\n\nThe former captain, having taken a bit of time to get in, has been striking at 172.9 in the fifth and sixth overs, even outdoing Salt's healthy strike-rate of 163.7.\n\nThe pair take on the powerplay in specific and complementary ways.\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "The men's T20 World Cup starts on Saturday against a backdrop of political tension.\n\nThe tournament, which features 20 teams, will be held in India and Sri Lanka.\n\nBangladesh are boycotting it after a request for their fixtures to be switched from India to Sri Lanka was refused by the sport's governing body.\n\nTheir place in Group C has been taken by Scotland.\n\nPakistan had considered boycotting but have since confirmed they will take part, though will not play their scheduled match against India.\n\nBangladesh had asked for their games to be switched from India, citing safety concerns amid growing tensions between the countries.\n\nRelations between the South Asian neighbours have soured since former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India in 2024, following deadly protests.\n\nIndia has not agreed to send her back despite several requests, and violent protests broke out after Sharif Osman Hadi - a prominent student leader in Bangladesh - was shot dead.\n\nIndia itself has raised concerns over violence targeting members of the minority Hindu community in Bangladesh.\n\nIn December, a Hindu man was accused of blasphemy and beaten to death by a mob in an incident that resulted in protests by Hindu nationalist groups in India.\n\nAgainst that political backdrop, Indian Premier League (IPL) side Kolkata Knight Riders released Bangladesh bowler Mustafizur Rahman in January after being instructed to do so by the Board of Control for Cricket in India.\n\nIn response, Bangladeshi authorities banned broadcasts of the IPL in the country.\n\nThe Bangladesh Cricket Board then requested that their World Cup fixtures be played in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe International Cricket Council - the sport's governing body - rejected that request, saying there was an \"absence of any credible security threat\" and gave the BCB a final 24 hours in which to declare their participation.\n\nWhen that deadline passed, Scotland were invited to the tournament.\n\nThe ICC said it was keen not to establish \"precedents that could undermine the neutrality and fairness of ICC events\".\n\nPakistan are boycotting their match against India, which was scheduled to take place in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on 15 February.\n\nIn a statement, the Pakistan government said it granted \"approval\" to the team's participation in the tournament but they \"shall not take to the field\" for the match against India.\n\nPakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi previously said the team could pull out completely after Bangladesh were removed from the tournament.\n\nPakistan and India have not faced each other outside men's major tournaments since 2013, and India have not played in Pakistan since 2008.\n\nPakistan did not host any touring nations between 2009 and 2019 following the Lahore attack on Sri Lanka's team bus, which killed six policemen and two civilians.\n\nPakistani players have also been banned from the IPL since 2009 following the Mumbai attacks that left 174 people - including nine gunmen - dead.\n\nLast year India refused to travel to Pakistan to play in the Champions Trophy and eventually played their matches in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIt resulted in the two nations signing an agreement stating the two countries would play at neutral venues whenever one of them hosts an ICC event.\n\nThe neighbours have fought a number of wars and had several military stand-offs since the partition of India in 1947, when the nation was split into India and the new state of Pakistan. It created an upsurge of violence, in which approximately 15 million people were displaced and an estimated one million died.\n\nRecent escalations were sparked after the neighbours engaged in a four-day military conflict in April 2025 following a deadly militant attack on tourists in India-administered Kashmir.\n\nThe ICC said Pakistan's stance was \"difficult to reconcile\" and called on the country's cricket chiefs to explore a \"mutually acceptable resolution\".\n\nThe governing body said that \"selective participation undermines the spirit and sanctity of the competitions\".\n\nIt said it \"respects the roles of governments in matters of national policy\" but continued: \"This decision is not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide, including millions in Pakistan.\"\n\nIt added it hoped the PCB would \"consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country\".\n\nFormer Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi is among those who have accused the ICC of mishandling the situation.\n\nIn a post on X, he said: \"It's regrettable that Pakistan won't play India, but I stand behind my government's decision.\n\n\"This is the moment for the ICC to lead and prove through decisions, not statements, that it is impartial, independent and fair to every member.\"\n\nMatches between Pakistan and India can draw huge TV audiences.\n\nReportedly, more than 600 million people watched last year's Champions Trophy fixture on Indian streaming platform JioHotstar.\n\nThe ICC has not published its playing conditions for the tournament so it is not known what sanction Pakistan could face.\n\nHowever, the rules for the previous tournament stated: \"If the match is decided by one side conceding defeat or refusing to play, the result shall be stated as match conceded or match awarded, as the case may be.\"\n\nIt is assumed India will be awarded two points for a win and Pakistan's net run-rate will also be hit by the forfeiture.\n\nPakistan face the Netherlands, USA and Namibia in their other group-stage games, and it is unclear what could happen if they were to face India in the final.\n\nTeams have pulled out of tournament fixtures before, with Australia and the West Indies both deciding not to travel to Colombo in the 1996 World Cup that was co-hosted by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.\n\nEngland also decided not to play their 2003 World Cup match against Zimbabwe in Harare, citing security concerns and social unrest in the country.\n\nNone of those nations received a subsequent fine or punishment from the ICC, though all forfeited the matches.\n\nBoth Pakistan and Bangladesh could receive other sanctions as the ICC has a precedent for punishing governments who interfere in the game.\n\nUnder article 2.4 of the ICC constitution, it outlines boards must manage their affairs \"autonomously and ensure that there is no government (or other public or quasi-public body) interference in its governance, regulation and/or administration of cricket\".\n\nIn 2019, Zimbabwe were suspended for three months after the government replaced the cricket board, leading to a freeze on funding and exclusion from World Cup qualifiers.\n\nFour years later, Sri Lanka also lost the right to host the Under-19 World Cup after its government dismissed the national board following poor performances.\n\nBoth nations later had their ICC membership restored.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nICC Men's T20 World Cup - everything you need to know\n\nWho owns the teams competing in The Hundred?\n\nWhat is the 'designated batters' rule introduced by Big Bash League?",

    "fullText": "MUMBAI, Feb 3 (Reuters) - India's financial markets rallied sharply on Tuesday after a trade deal that slashed U.S. tariffs on Indian goods to 18% ​from 50%, a development that investors said lifts a key overhang over the ‌country's stocks, bonds and currency.\n\nIndia's benchmark stock index, the Nifty 50, surged nearly 5%, about 100 points away from ‌its record high hit in January. The rupee climbed over 1% to 90.40 per dollar in early trading. The yield on the country's 10-year benchmark bond declined 5 bps to 6.72%\n\nThe Nifty's rise put it on course for the best one-day gain in five years while the rupee ⁠was on track for its ‌best day since November 2022.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced the deal on social media following a call with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, noting ‍that India had agreed to halt Russian oil purchases and lower trade barriers on U.S. exports.\n\nIndian stock markets and the rupee have been battered since the tariffs were levied by Washington in late August, ​placing them among the worst-performing emerging market assets in 2025, with record foreign investor ‌outflows.\n\nThe trade breakthrough is expected to alleviate the persistent drag, with investors expecting a bounce-back in foreign sentiment and flows into Indian assets.\n\n\"We believe this trade deal announcement should lift a key overhang on Indian equities. Foreign investors who have been net sellers recently might also look to increase their weight to India in light of this announcement,\" said Prashant Paroda, portfolio ⁠manager with AllSpring Global's Intrinsic Emerging Market equities ​team.\n\nThe trade deal is also expected to lift a ​pall of geopolitical uncertainty which had accompanied the U.S.-India trade rift, keeping investors cautious on plowing money into the country.\n\n\"The key tail risk of geopolitical ‍isolation about which investors ⁠were concerned has now been adequately addressed by back-to-back trade deals with the European Union and United States,\" economists at Citi said in a note.\n\nThe breakthrough with the ⁠U.S. comes less than a week after India signed a long-awaited trade deal with the European Union that ‌is expected to eliminate or reduce tariffs on 96.6% of traded goods by ‌value.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Indian stocks and the rupee are set for strong gains on Tuesday after a trade deal that slashes U.S. tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50% in exchange for India halting Russian oil purchases and lowering trade barriers.\n\nHere are some comments from investors and analysts:\n\nRADHIKA RAO, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DBS, ​SINGAPORE:\n\n\"This breakthrough is unmistakably positive for the real economy/exports, sentiment as well as financial markets, while further details are awaited. Textiles, gems & jewellery, engineering goods, leather and chemicals are ‌likely amongst the key gainers.\n\n\"An eventual unveiling of the bilateral trade agreement will provide more details on the beneficiary product lines and trade as well as investment commitments. Domestic markets are expected to witness a relief rally at open, after ‌high tariffs had been one of the key drags on sentiment in the past quarter.\"\n\nCHARU CHANANA, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SAXO, SINGAPORE:\n\n\"This is constructive for Indian equities because it reduces trade policy uncertainty and improves visibility for export-linked earnings - exactly the kind of catalyst that can restart the narrative when global investors have been cautious. But there's a lot we still don't know. If the oil bill rises meaningfully, that can reintroduce inflation and currency sensitivity.\n\n\"The structural story remains strong and the latest budget’s infrastructure and AI push keeps the ‘catch-up’ theme alive. For foreign investors though, the next hurdle is the Indian rupee, which means ⁠the market may look less like a one-way beta trade and ‌more like a dispersion market.\"\n\nMARC VELAN, HEAD OF INVESTMENTS, LUCERNE ASSET MANAGEMENT, SINGAPORE:\n\n\"The trade deal removes a chunk of policy and tariff uncertainty that had been weighing on Indian assets, opening the door for a near-term bounce in the rupee and equities via sentiment and foreign flows, though sustainability will depend ‍on how the deal is implemented rather than the headline itself.\"\n\nTRIDEEP BHATTACHARYA, PRESIDENT & CIO, EQUITIES, EDELWEISS ASSET MANAGEMENT, MUMBAI:\n\n\"The reduction in tariffs from around 50% to ~18% has come in materially better than consensus expectations. When combined with the recently concluded India–EU trade agreement, this potentially represents one of the strongest external growth stimuli for the Indian economy in 2026.\"\n\nLAKSHMAN VENKITARAMAN, ASSOCIATE PORTFOLIO MANAGER, WASTACH GLOBAL, SALT LAKE CITY:\n\n\"We believe the trade deal improves ​investor sentiment toward India. While the U.S. is India’s largest trading partner, exports to the U.S. account for less than 5% of India’s GDP. Nonetheless, U.S.-India trade frictions have weighed on foreign ‌investor perception. This has been compounded by a global trade focused on AI, which has disproportionately benefited markets such as Taiwan and Korea.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - India's government on Sunday handed a major win to Apple by allowing foreign companies to provide machines to their contract manufacturers in certain areas for five years ​without any tax risk.\n\nApple has been growing in India in recent years as it diversifies beyond China. Counterpoint Research ‌says iPhone's share of the Indian market has doubled to 8% since 2022. And while China still accounts for 75% of global iPhone shipments, India's share ‌has quadrupled to 25% since 2022.\n\nWhat is Apple's current market position in India?\n\nWhat tax changes did India make for Apple?\n\nWhy was Apple concerned about India's tax laws?\n\nHow will this benefit Apple's manufacturing strategy?\n\nApple had been lobbying India's government to modify its income tax laws to ensure the company is not taxed for ownership of the high-end iPhone machinery it provides to its contract manufacturers.\n\nIn India, unlike China, Apple was concerned that if it paid for machines for its contract manufacturers, Indian law could consider that a so-called \"business connection\" and impose taxes on its iPhone sales profits. ⁠That had forced its contract manufacturers Foxconn and ‌Tata to themselves spend billions of dollars on machines.\n\nIndia on Sunday said that \"to promote manufacturing of electronic goods for a contract manufacturer\", it is making certain law changes to ensure that mere ownership of ‍machines by a foreign company does not lead to taxes on it.\n\nThe decision was made public as part of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's 2026-27 annual budget, presented on Sunday.\n\nThe move could prompt Apple and other companies to invest rapidly in the electronics manufacturing space by taking over initial ​expenses for pricey machines, reducing the initial cost burden on contract manufacturers they partner with.\n\n\"We are saying that if you bring ‌your machine, and that machine is used by a local manufacturer to produce something, we will ... exempt you for 5 years. We are giving them certainty,\" Revenue Secretary Arvind Shrivastava said at a post-budget press conference.\n\nFASTER SCALE-UP AND GREATER CONFIDENCE\n\nSmartphone manufacturing is a key plank of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's agenda for economic growth.\n\nThe rule change will apply until the 2030-31 tax year and only to factories set up in so-called customs-bonded areas - which are technically considered being outside India’s customs border. If devices are sold within India from ⁠such factories, they will attract import taxes, making such facilities attractive only ​for exports.\n\n\"Any income arising on account of providing capital goods, equipment or tooling ​to a contract manufacturer, being a company resident in India, is eligible for exemption,\" the Indian government said in one of its explanatory budget documents.",

BPCL also signed a term agreement with TotalEnergies for the procurement of UAE crude.\n\nIndian Oil Corp (IOC), the country's largest refiner, last year ​signed a five-year import deal with Trafigura to buy 2.5 million metric tons of LNG ‌in a deal valued at $1.3 billion-$1.4 billion.\n\nIOC's head of marketing, S.P. Srivastava told reporters at the conference that the company expects annual diesel demand to grow by 2-3% and gasoline demand to rise by 5-6% by 2030.\n\nIt signed a preliminary agreement with Paris-based Engie at India Energy Week for LNG and other natural gas trading opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region, IOC Chairman A.S.

    "title": "India–New Zealand FTA: A People-First Pact for a New Era of Trade",
    "description": "India and New Zealand have concluded a landmark free-trade agreement that prioritizes people and services alongside goods.",
    "fullText": "Even as the global trade sector has experienced an Annus Horribilis (horrible year), 2025 has been India’s year of trade acceleration. In July, New Delhi signed the India-UK Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA); in December, it sealed a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with Oman; and now, in a record nine months, India and New Zealand have concluded their free‑trade agreement (FTA), pending legal review and formal ratification.\n\nAlongside early-harvest and launch tracks with the EU, Chile and the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), plus a revived Early Progress Trade Agreement (EPTA) with Canada, a clear picture of India’s new trade architecture is emerging. New Delhi is building high-quality, rules-based bilateral arrangements, phased where necessary, with partners that complement, rather than compete with, India’s strengths and priorities.\n\nOn one level, the India-New Zealand FTA is a straightforward extension of this — a pragmatic deal between two economies whose bilateral trade, while steadily growing, currently stands at a minuscule $2.4 billion, thus leaving plenty of potential to unlock. On the other hand, it tells us something broader about where India is headed and how it intends to build prosperity, with people, not just products, at the center.\n\nFor decades, commentators have reduced India’s trade strategy to a binary: open the gates and risk import surges or stay cautious and forgo the scale and opportunity that the global economic order offers. That false choice collapsed when India refused to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and instead rewired its negotiating posture around complementarity.\n\nThis shift in strategy has been made possible by a wave of internal reforms that reached a new peak in 2025. Major changes, most notably the rollout of Goods and Services Tax (GST) 2.0 this year, alongside other key reforms under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s tenure, including the simplification of foreign direct investment (FDI) norms, expanded production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes, digital governance improvements and the implementation of the Four Labor Codes, have all contributed to investor confidence.\n\nIt is this transformed, future-ready India that now approaches trade negotiations from a position of strength. New Zealand fits that map. It is a high-income, rules-based economy that doesn’t compete head-to-head with India in mass manufacturing; instead, it welcomes Indian services, talent and consumer goods under transparent and fair terms.\n\nThose terms are striking. New Zealand has granted zero-duty access to all Indian exports. Not “most,” not “nearly all” — all. For India’s labor-intensive sectors — textiles and apparel, leather and footwear, gems and jewelry, marine products, toys, handicrafts — this is a once-in-a-generation opening; the kind you build upon to broaden value chains. Small exporters who dreaded duties and nickel-and-diming at the border can now quote with confidence, contract with certainty, ship with speed and expand their operations thanks to cash flows freed from tariffs.\n\nIndia, for its part, has offered tariff liberalization on about 70% of tariff lines, covering 95% of bilateral trade value. This has been done through a calibrated blend of immediate cuts (sheep meat, wool, coal, most forestry and wood), phased reductions (oils, select machinery, wine) and carefully managed tariff-rate quotas for a handful of sensitive horticulture lines (honey, apples, kiwifruit).\n\nBut these concessions have been meticulously crafted to ensure that India’s most sensitive sectors remain protected. Dairy is the most prominent exclusion; it is entirely ring-fenced. The shield extends further: animal products (other than sheep meat), key vegetables, sugar, some oils and strategic nonagricultural sectors such as gems and jewelry, copper and aluminum are all excluded from tariff concessions.\n\nThis is an unmistakable signal that India will write modern, liberal trade rules, but it will do so while securing farmer incomes, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) resilience, and food security. This is not protectionism; it is democratic prioritization for a country where agriculture is a livelihood for millions and not just another sector to be casually bartered away.\n\nThe agreement’s spine, however, is not goods but rather services and mobility. New Zealand’s services commitments are its most ambitious to date, granting Indian firms broad access across IT and IT-enabled services, professional and business services, education, finance, tourism and construction.\n\nCrucially, the agreement includes a Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) clause: if New Zealand offers better terms to another partner in the future, India automatically receives the same benefits. For India’s already globally competitive services sector, this means new opportunities to establish a presence in Oceania, recruit local talent and scale operations in a stable, rules-based environment.\n\nBut the real innovation is the Temporary Employment Entry Visa, a pathway for up to 5,000 Indian professionals at any given time to live and work in New Zealand for up to three years, targeted at skill shortages (IT, engineering, healthcare, education, construction) and specialty roles (yoga instructors, Indian chefs, music teachers). Paired with the fact that the agreement removes numerical caps on Indian students, guarantees 20 hours/week of work during study, and extends post-study work to 3 years for science, technology, engineering and mathematics graduates and 4 years for doctorates, as well as a 1,000-place Working Holiday scheme, and you’ve stitched the “living bridge” of a 300,000-strong Indian diaspora into the economic fabric.\n\nCritics — some inside New Zealand’s politics — have argued that these mobility channels “give too much away.” That is an entirely incorrect framing, though. Global trade today is not a container-ship contest; it is a talent distribution contest. When shortages hobble hospitals, classrooms and infrastructure sites, partnering with a country that supplies trained professionals under transparent, targeted and time-bound rules is not a concession for New Zealand; it is capacity building.\n\nFor India, talent mobility is not brain drain but instead brain circulation. Earnings, networks and know-how will eventually come home, while remittances in the interim can help stabilize families. Far from “giving away” jobs, this agreement allows New Zealand to fill gaps that its own workforce cannot meet. At the same time, the pathways it opens enable Indian professionals to gain global experience and return with skills that strengthen India’s economy — further enhancing India’s international reputation as a source of reliable, high-quality talent.\n\nThe FTA also does the dull yet decisive things right. Customs modernization commits India to 48-hour release windows at the border. That single clause can save exporters more money than many tariff cuts, because time itself can act as a shadow tariff. The pact hardwires cooperation on standards and sanitary rules and creates Agri-Technology Action Plans for kiwifruit, apples and honey. These plans mean both countries will collaborate on sharing best practices — needless to say, India will be the beneficiary.\n\nAdditionally, the agreement requires New Zealand to update its Geographical Indications (GI) framework, thereby granting India the same rights as the EU to register wines, spirits and other goods, ensuring full parity in GI protection. Regulatory access for pharmaceuticals, medical devices and organic products has also been streamlined, reducing duplication and accelerating approvals.\n\nThere is also long-term capital behind this agreement: New Zealand has pledged $ 20 billion in investment in India over the next 15 years. The scale of this commitment signals confidence in India’s economic trajectory and its potential as a global growth engine. The agreement also includes a rebalancing clause that allows India to take remedial measures if the delivery of investments falls short of its commitments. India has learned that FTAs without real capital and capability often disappoint; this one addresses both, the kind of long-term backbone that many earlier agreements lacked.\n\nOf course, no agreement is without its challenges. The FTA will require careful implementation and timely ratification, efficient visa processing, and real delivery on its various Agri-tech and customs commitments.\n\nBut from an Indian perspective, the fundamentals are solid: the deal is structured to maximize opportunity while safeguarding core interests. It is precisely the template India should look to replicate — combining asymmetric access to goods that favors MSMEs with ambitious services and talent mobility. It is bilateralism that looks beyond tariffs, focusing instead on people, productivity and a true sense of partnership.\n\nIndia’s new trade architecture is not merely about opening doors but about building bridges among economies, nations and, above all, people. In that vein, the India-New Zealand FTA is a blueprint for how the next decade of Indian trade can and should be built.\n\n[Kaitlyn Diana edited this piece.]\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Fair Observer’s editorial policy.\n\nWe rely on your support for our independence, diversity and quality.\n\nFor more than 10 years, Fair Observer has been free, fair and independent.

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI/BRUSSELS, Jan 25 (Reuters) - India plans to slash tariffs on cars imported from the European Union to 40% from as high as 110%, sources said, in the biggest opening yet of the country's vast ​market as the two sides close in on a free trade pact that could come as early as Tuesday.\n\nPrime Minister ‌Narendra Modi's government has agreed to immediately reduce the tax on a limited number of cars from the 27-nation bloc with an import price of more than 15,000 euros ($17,739), ‌two sources briefed on the talks told Reuters.\n\nThis will be further lowered to 10% over time, they added, easing access to the Indian market for European automakers such as Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and BMW.\n\nThe sources declined to be identified as the talks are confidential and could be subject to last-minute changes. India's commerce ministry and the European Commission declined to comment.\n\nPACT ALREADY DUBBED 'MOTHER OF ALL DEALS'\n\nIndia and the EU are expected to announce on Tuesday the ⁠conclusion of protracted negotiations for the free trade ‌pact, after which the two sides will finalise the details and ratify what is being called \"the mother of all deals.\n\nThe pact could expand bilateral trade and lift Indian exports of goods such as textiles and jewellery, which ‍have been hit by 50% U.S. tariffs since late August.\n\nIndia is the world's third-largest car market by sales after the U.S. and China, but its domestic auto industry has been one of the most protected. New Delhi currently levies tariffs of 70% and 110% on imported cars, a level often criticised by executives, ​including Tesla chief Elon Musk.\n\nNew Delhi has proposed slashing import duties to 40% immediately for about 200,000 combustion-engine cars a year, one ‌of the sources said, its most aggressive move yet to open up the sector. This quota could be subject to last-minute changes, the source added.\n\nBattery electric vehicles will be excluded from import duty reductions for the first five years to protect investments by domestic players like Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors in the nascent sector, the two sources said. After five years EVs will follow similar duty cuts.\n\nMARKET CURRENTLY DOMINATED BY SUZUKI AND LOCAL MAKERS\n\nLower import taxes will be a boost for European automakers such as Volkswagen, Renault and Stellantis, as well as luxury players ⁠Mercedes-Benz and BMW which locally manufacture cars in India but have struggled to grow ​beyond a point in part due to high tariffs.\n\nLower taxes will allow carmakers to ​sell imported vehicles for a cheaper price and test the market with a broader portfolio before committing to manufacturing more cars locally, said one of the two sources.",

What is needed is a bold, focused and cohesive strategy to drive transformative change,\" according to a government official involved in drafting the policy.\n\nMODEST FUNDING ⁠TO BE DECIDED BY GOVERNMENT PANEL\n\nThe government will ‌spend about 100 billion rupees ($1 billion) to build infrastructure for about 30 manufacturing hubs across the targeted sectors while providing grants of $218 million for advanced areas such as chips and energy storage, said ‍the officials, who asked not to be named because they were not authorised to speak to media.\n\nThe Finance Ministry and government think tank NITI Aayog, which is tasked with preparing the policy, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nFunding this time is modest as the plan focuses on easing ​regulatory and compliance burdens, the biggest impediment to Indian manufacturing, rather than doling out subsidies, the officials said.\n\nFinancial support to ‌industries will be decided case by case with recommendations from a new government panel to administrative departments, replacing the pre-budget fiscal packages of earlier schemes, they said.\n\nThe new structure, called the National Manufacturing Mission, was announced in the budget last year but details were not disclosed. Details could be announced in the budget on February 1, but that will be decided closer to the date, the officials said.\n\nThe panel's focus will be to ensure faster regulatory clearance, approvals for land and cheaper financing for ⁠large projects, the officials said. It will be chaired by a minister ​and composed of bureaucrats, including the cabinet secretary, they said.\n\nIt will oversee the ​building of manufacturing hubs for the 15 sectors, and work with state governments to assure steady and cheap electricity supplies for such units, the sources said.",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW, Jan 23 (Reuters) - China is set to ramp up imports of Russian oil in January, absorbing barrels that would have previously gone to India ​and Turkey, as tougher Western sanctions force Moscow to redirect flows, LSEG data ‌and traders said.\n\nThe United States and the European Union imposed sweeping sanctions in late 2025 targeting Russian oil ‌sellers and shippers, including energy giants Rosneft and Lukoil, complicating purchases for global buyers and tightening scrutiny on Russian crude exports.\n\nChina is poised to receive nearly 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of Russian oil by sea this month, compared with 1.1 million bpd in December, according to ⁠preliminary LSEG data. Beijing, already ‌a key consumer of Russian Far East ESPO Blend, also boosted imports of Russian Urals oil to a record high of 405,000 bpd ‍in January, the highest since mid-2023, data provided by energy consultancy Kpler showed.\n\nIndia, previously the largest buyer of Russian Urals by sea since the EU embargo on Moscow's oil in 2022, slashed purchases ​to below 1 million bpd in December, down from an average of 1.3 million ‌bpd last year, LSEG data showed. Indian refiners are expected to keep Russian oil imports near 1 million bpd in January as they diversify supply sources.\n\nTurkey, also a major Russian oil buyer, reduced Urals imports in January to about 250,000 bpd, compared to an average of 275,000 bpd in 2025 and well below the record 400,000 bpd reached in June ⁠last year.\n\n\"As Indian and Turkish buyers cut purchases ​recently, some Russian Urals cargoes headed for China,\" said ​a trader involved in Russian oil sales. He added that the surplus of Urals barrels weighed on prices.\n\nDiscounts for Urals crude delivered to China ‍in late 2025 widened ⁠to as much as $12 per barrel below ICE Brent for some cargoes, while current Urals differentials hover near minus $10 to the benchmark, according to two traders active ⁠in the Asian market.\n\nDemand for Urals in India and Turkey, both major exporters of diesel to Europe, slumped ‌due to the EU ban on fuels produced from Russian-origin crude, the ‌traders added.",

    "description": "The High Court in New Delhi, India, has granted another pirate site blocking order in favor of American movie industry giants.",
    "fullText": "Pirate sites and services can be a real challenge for rightsholders to deal with. In India, however, recent court orders have proven to be quite effective.\n\nIndian courts have issued pirate site blocking orders for over a decade. Initially, these orders were relatively basic, requiring local Internet providers to block specific domain names.\n\nThese regular injunctions were only partially effective. After the High Court granted a blocking injunction, pirate sites would often switch to new domains, requiring rightsholders to return to court to get these blocked as well.\n\nTo deal with this problem, the dynamic injunction was invented. These orders were issued to more effectively deny access to content made available on pirate sites. ISPs were not only required to block original domains but also any clones and mirror sites that surfaced after the order was signed.\n\nWhen dynamic injunctions were no longer sufficient to slay the piracy hydra, rightsholders suggested upgrading the Indian blocking regime with Dynamic ++ injunctions. These orders also protect copyrighted content that has yet to be registered.\n\nIn addition, Dynamic++ orders and their ‘superlative‘ variant also include domain name registrars as defendants. This includes blocking orders targeted at U.S. domain registrars.\n\nThe ability to target domain name registrants proved to be a game changer. Over the past two years, it allowed rightsholders to disable domains of various prominent pirate sites, some with dozens of millions of visitors. While these sites could simply register new domains, the legal efforts certainly affected their operation.\n\nFor this reason, it is no surprise to see that several American movie industry players have ramped up their enforcement actions in India, targeting hundreds of domains at a time. And since these orders effectively suspend domains at various domain name registrars, new requests keep coming in.\n\nAs reported by Verdictum a few days ago, the High Court in New Delhi issued a new blocking injunction on December 18, targeting more than 150 pirate site domains, including yflix.to, animesuge.bz, bs.to, and many others.\n\nThe complaint is filed by Warner Bros., Apple, Crunchyroll, Disney, and Netflix, which are all connected to the MPA’s anti-piracy arm, ACE. The referenced works include some of the most pirated titles, such as Stranger Things, Squid Game, and Silo.\n\nIn addition to targeting Indian ISPs, the order also lists various domain name registries and related organizations as defendants. This includes American registrars such as Namecheap and GoDaddy, but also the government of the Kingdom of Tonga, which is linked to .to domains.\n\nIn addition to suspending the domain names within three days days, the domain name registrars are given four weeks to disclose the relevant subscriber information connected to these domains.\n\n“[The registrars] shall lock and suspend Defendant Nos. 1 to 47 websites within 72 hours of being communicated with a copy of this Order and shall file all the Basic Subscriber Information, including the name, address, contact information, email addresses, bank details, IP logs, and any other relevant information […] within four weeks of being communicated with a copy of this Order,” the High Court wrote.\n\nWhile the “Dynamic+” injunction is designed to be a global kill switch, its effectiveness depends entirely on the cooperation of the domain name registrars. Since most of these are based outside of India, their compliance is not guaranteed.\n\nAccording to our analysis, it appears that most domain names have not been suspended. These pirate sites domains continue to be accessible today. Some continue running from their original domains, while others redirect to new ones, suggesting that they remain controlling their original owners.\n\nThis includes domains that are linked to Namecheap, Tucows, GoDaddy, NameSilo, Dynadot, OVH and others. The government of the Kingdom of Tonga did not comply with the Indian court order either.\n\nAs far as we can see, domains linked to the American registrar Porkbun, the UK-based WHG Hosting services, and the Lithuanian registrar Hostinger were fully suspended. Registrar.eu also put some domains on clientHold, and the one that remains accessible (animesuge.bz) is linked to Namecheap now.\n\nIt’s not unprecedented for foreign companies, including American ones, not to comply with Indian court orders. However, in this case, it is worth noting that Namecheap previously appeared to comply with similar orders from the Delhi High Court.\n\nThe non-compliance must come as a disappointment to Netflix, Warner Bros. and the others. However, they will likely be back in court for more blocking and suspension orders soon enough.\n\nAll in all, it is clear that India’s High Court has a streamlined process in place that effectively orders local ISPs to block pirate sites. However, the intended global reach seems to be restricted to a few registrars, for now.\n\nA copy of the High Court order, issued on December 18, 2025, by Justice Tejas Karia, is available here (pdf). The court order includes 163 unique domain names, some of which are not linked to a registrar. An overview of the 125 domains that are linked to targeted registrars and related entities is provided below. .",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 23 (Reuters) - India can leverage its growing energy demand to negotiate better oil and gas ​supply deals, Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Friday, ‌as its refiners continue seeking alternatives to Russian oil.\n\nIndia became the top buyer of discounted ‌Russian seaborne crude after Moscow's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, but challenges posed by Western sanctions eventually prompted Indian refiners to increase imports from other sources.\n\nIndian officials have been careful to avoid directly referencing Russian oil ⁠imports, but Puri said ‌supplies from \"one source\" that had surged after February 2022, were now easing.\n\nData obtained from trade sources showed India's Russian ‍oil imports fell to their lowest level in two years in December, lifting OPEC's share of imports to an 11-month high.\n\nIndia's rising oil demand gives it \"a ​little bit of positioning inside the world\" to negotiate better deals, ‌Puri said.\n\nThe world's third-largest oil importer and consumer should have no trouble covering its needs given ample global supplies and rising output in countries such as Brazil, Guyana, Suriname and the United States.\n\nIndian refiners have been buying more oil from Middle Eastern, African and South American ⁠countries to make up for a drop ​in Russian oil imports, which is expected ​to help India negotiate a tariff deal with Washington.\n\nPuri said Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd had doubled the size of its ‍annual contract with ⁠Brazil's Petrobras.\n\nIndian Oil Corp, the country's top refiner, has bought 7 million barrels of oil, including from Brazil's Petrobras, for March ⁠loading to replace Russian oil, trade sources said.\n\nIOC last month bought its first Colombian ‌oil and for the first time bought Ecuadorean Oriente crude.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Nidhi VermaEditing by Tomasz Janowski)",

    "description": "From China and the US to India and Russia, here are the 25 largest militaries in the world, ranked by the number of active-duty armed forces.",
    "fullText": "While the US military has pursued ambitious technological advances, manpower remains one of its core pillars.\n\nFrom high-ranking generals to soldiers on the field, human troops remain a key way to assess the reach and power of the world's militaries.\n\nUsing data from the International Institute for Strategic Studies' 2025 Military Balance report, Business Insider ranked countries by the size of their active armed forces and listed their defense budgets, based on 2024 figures.\n\nActive-duty force size is a tally of a country's uniformed troops: airmen, soldiers, sailors, special operators, and Marines. Armies, in particular, depend on size to gain and occupy ground. Militaries can also be a tool of domestic repression, a focus that undercuts its capabilities against an external foe. North Korea, for example, is one of the world's most repressive states, led by a dictator who has repeatedly threatened neighboring South Korea.\n\nThe number of active-duty military personnel is far from the only factor that matters when comparing military power between countries, but it shows latent power that could be augmented via conscription and calling up reservists.\n\n\"Numbers have value, but there's a lot more to military capability,\" said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, DC-based foreign policy and national security think tank.\n\nIISS, a London-headquartered think tank, counts active armed forces, reservists, and paramilitaries as separate categories in its analysis, showing a fuller picture of each nation's manpower.\n\nSome countries have significantly higher numbers of reservists than others — Vietnam has the largest number in the world, estimated at 5 million.\n\nBut while reservists can aid militaries when needed, the quality and longevity of their expertise can vary between conscription- and volunteer-based systems, Cancian told Business Insider.\n\n\"When you look at some countries' reserve numbers, you're often looking at people who haven't trained in 10 or 20 years,\" he said. \"It gives you a big number, but their military value is questionable.\"\n\nAnd while paramilitaries can be effective at enforcing internal security and party strength, Cancian says that \"as a military force, they have essentially zero value.\"\n\nEven when accounting for all of a military's manpower, personnel is only one of the various factors that can qualify a nation's military strength, which also include equipment and readiness.\n\nThere's also the role of technologies in global warfare, the size and sophistication of air forces and naval fleets, amphibious capabilities to land assault forces, command and control systems, or nuclear forces, which all shape military power. Larger and more advanced forces require higher state expenditures.\n\nStill, comparing global manpower offers insight into how countries prioritize military power.\n\nSee how the world's largest militaries stack up.",
