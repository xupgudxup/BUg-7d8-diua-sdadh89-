BPCL also signed a term agreement with TotalEnergies for the procurement of UAE crude.\n\nIndian Oil Corp (IOC), the country's largest refiner, last year ​signed a five-year import deal with Trafigura to buy 2.5 million metric tons of LNG ‌in a deal valued at $1.3 billion-$1.4 billion.\n\nIOC's head of marketing, S.P. Srivastava told reporters at the conference that the company expects annual diesel demand to grow by 2-3% and gasoline demand to rise by 5-6% by 2030.\n\nIt signed a preliminary agreement with Paris-based Engie at India Energy Week for LNG and other natural gas trading opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region, IOC Chairman A.S. Sahney ⁠said.\n\nTop gas importer Petronet LNG forecasts LNG imports will ​rise to 28 million-29 million tons in 2026, from ​about 25.5 million tons last year.\n\nTrading giant Vitol expects most of India's refinery output to be absorbed domestically.\n\n\"There is 500,000 (barrels per day) of refining capacity coming ‍online,\" said Kieran Gallagher, Vitol's ⁠Asia head. \"Outside...summer seasonality and exports, largely the products derived from that capacity are going to be consumed within the country itself.\"\n\nOpportunities for traders also extend to petrochemicals, where supply ⁠remains structurally short despite government estimates that production will rise by 29.62 million tons to 46 million tons by ‌2030.",

A Lloyd’s of London spokesperson declined to comment. The companies' plans to ⁠set up operations in the Gujarat International Finance ‌Tec‑City, or GIFT City, have not been previously reported.\n\nThe city offers businesses favourable tax treatment, such as a 10-year tax holiday and exemption from capital gains.\n\nThe government has said it hopes it will rival Singapore and ‍Dubai as an international financial centre.\n\nIndia's reinsurance market is currently dominated by Swiss Re and Munich Re, as well as private firms and the government-owned GIC Re that is widely expected to grow after the government introduced reforms to deepen India's insurance penetration.\n\nSAUDI RE AND OTHERS HAVE RECEIVED APPROVAL\n\nA few large ​reinsurers have received approvals over the last year to begin operating in GIFT City. These include Saudi Re, Korean Re, Peak Re, ‌Kuwait Re, Abu Dhabi National Insurance and Kazakh‑based Eurasia Insurance Company JSC, according to regulatory officials and company statements.\n\nSaudi Re earlier this week opened its GIFT City branch, its second in Asia after Malaysia.\n\nKorean Re has said its expansion reflected its commitment to India’s high growth insurance sector, while Hong Kong‑based Peak Re, which received a licence in March 2025, said it plans to offer life and non-life insurance.\n\nAbout 14 global reinsurers operate from GIFT City, managing an annualised $700–800 million in premiums, public disclosures show.\n\nThe number of reinsurers is expected to increase ⁠to at least 20 by the end of March 2026, two regulatory officials ​said, declining to be identified as final approvals are pending.\n\nThey said the international reinsurers ​sought to offer products that are relatively underdeveloped in India, including surety bonds, parametric insurance, marine and shipping cover, cyber risk and health reinsurance.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Jan 27 (Reuters) - India and China cut emissions from electricity generation by accelerating clean energy deployment, researchers say, offsetting growing coal use in the U.S. and capping global ​growth in pollutants linked to climate change.\n\nPower sector emissions by China and India, the world's ‌top coal users who accounted for 93% of the rise in carbon dioxide discharges in the decade through 2024, declined simultaneously for the ‌first time in 52 years, according to a report by Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) this month.\n\n\"The fall in emissions in China and India in 2025 is a sign of things to come, as both countries added a record amount of new clean-power generation last year, which was more than sufficient to meet ⁠rising demand,\" said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst ‌at CREA, an independent research group registered in Finland.\n\nCHINA, INDIA POWER EMISSIONS FALL\n\nChina's power sector emissions fell by 40 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e), or 0.7% annually ‍in 2025, while discharges by Indian utilities declined 38 million tCO2e, or 4.1%, in the 11 months to the end of November, according to estimates from energy think-tank Ember compiled based on monthly government statistics.\n\nThat offset a 55.7 million metric tons ​of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) rise in annual U.S. emissions after an annual 13.1% increase in coal-fired power ‌output drove U.S. power plant emissions 3.3% higher in 2025, the fastest this century, the estimates showed, helping global emissions stay largely flat.\n\nPower plant emissions rose 3.4% in China and 4.4% in India annually on average over the 10 years to 2024, but fell 2.4% in the U.S. The three countries account for 60% of the world's power sector emissions, which make up about 35% of all polluting discharges linked to climate change.\n\nChina's ⁠coal use is set to decline gradually this decade, the ​International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its annual coal report in December, ​helping emissions from power generation plateau in the coming years.\n\nIn India, however, while record renewables additions and marginal growth in power demand helped New Delhi suppress coal use this ‍year, the IEA expects the ⁠country to continue depending on coal.\n\n\"Although coal-fired power generation declines in 2025, a moderate increase in coal consumption for power generation is nevertheless expected ... due to a steady rise in electricity demand,\" the ⁠IEA said.\n\nIn the U.S., the agency expects higher costs to reduce coal demand by 6% in the years until 2030 despite policy ‌incentives by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration and a slowdown in coal plant closures.",

    "title": "India–New Zealand FTA: A People-First Pact for a New Era of Trade",
    "description": "India and New Zealand have concluded a landmark free-trade agreement that prioritizes people and services alongside goods.",
    "fullText": "Even as the global trade sector has experienced an Annus Horribilis (horrible year), 2025 has been India’s year of trade acceleration. In July, New Delhi signed the India-UK Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA); in December, it sealed a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with Oman; and now, in a record nine months, India and New Zealand have concluded their free‑trade agreement (FTA), pending legal review and formal ratification.\n\nAlongside early-harvest and launch tracks with the EU, Chile and the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), plus a revived Early Progress Trade Agreement (EPTA) with Canada, a clear picture of India’s new trade architecture is emerging. New Delhi is building high-quality, rules-based bilateral arrangements, phased where necessary, with partners that complement, rather than compete with, India’s strengths and priorities.\n\nOn one level, the India-New Zealand FTA is a straightforward extension of this — a pragmatic deal between two economies whose bilateral trade, while steadily growing, currently stands at a minuscule $2.4 billion, thus leaving plenty of potential to unlock. On the other hand, it tells us something broader about where India is headed and how it intends to build prosperity, with people, not just products, at the center.\n\nFor decades, commentators have reduced India’s trade strategy to a binary: open the gates and risk import surges or stay cautious and forgo the scale and opportunity that the global economic order offers. That false choice collapsed when India refused to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and instead rewired its negotiating posture around complementarity.\n\nThis shift in strategy has been made possible by a wave of internal reforms that reached a new peak in 2025. Major changes, most notably the rollout of Goods and Services Tax (GST) 2.0 this year, alongside other key reforms under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s tenure, including the simplification of foreign direct investment (FDI) norms, expanded production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes, digital governance improvements and the implementation of the Four Labor Codes, have all contributed to investor confidence.\n\nIt is this transformed, future-ready India that now approaches trade negotiations from a position of strength. New Zealand fits that map. It is a high-income, rules-based economy that doesn’t compete head-to-head with India in mass manufacturing; instead, it welcomes Indian services, talent and consumer goods under transparent and fair terms.\n\nThose terms are striking. New Zealand has granted zero-duty access to all Indian exports. Not “most,” not “nearly all” — all. For India’s labor-intensive sectors — textiles and apparel, leather and footwear, gems and jewelry, marine products, toys, handicrafts — this is a once-in-a-generation opening; the kind you build upon to broaden value chains. Small exporters who dreaded duties and nickel-and-diming at the border can now quote with confidence, contract with certainty, ship with speed and expand their operations thanks to cash flows freed from tariffs.\n\nIndia, for its part, has offered tariff liberalization on about 70% of tariff lines, covering 95% of bilateral trade value. This has been done through a calibrated blend of immediate cuts (sheep meat, wool, coal, most forestry and wood), phased reductions (oils, select machinery, wine) and carefully managed tariff-rate quotas for a handful of sensitive horticulture lines (honey, apples, kiwifruit).\n\nBut these concessions have been meticulously crafted to ensure that India’s most sensitive sectors remain protected. Dairy is the most prominent exclusion; it is entirely ring-fenced. The shield extends further: animal products (other than sheep meat), key vegetables, sugar, some oils and strategic nonagricultural sectors such as gems and jewelry, copper and aluminum are all excluded from tariff concessions.\n\nThis is an unmistakable signal that India will write modern, liberal trade rules, but it will do so while securing farmer incomes, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) resilience, and food security. This is not protectionism; it is democratic prioritization for a country where agriculture is a livelihood for millions and not just another sector to be casually bartered away.\n\nThe agreement’s spine, however, is not goods but rather services and mobility. New Zealand’s services commitments are its most ambitious to date, granting Indian firms broad access across IT and IT-enabled services, professional and business services, education, finance, tourism and construction.\n\nCrucially, the agreement includes a Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) clause: if New Zealand offers better terms to another partner in the future, India automatically receives the same benefits. For India’s already globally competitive services sector, this means new opportunities to establish a presence in Oceania, recruit local talent and scale operations in a stable, rules-based environment.\n\nBut the real innovation is the Temporary Employment Entry Visa, a pathway for up to 5,000 Indian professionals at any given time to live and work in New Zealand for up to three years, targeted at skill shortages (IT, engineering, healthcare, education, construction) and specialty roles (yoga instructors, Indian chefs, music teachers). Paired with the fact that the agreement removes numerical caps on Indian students, guarantees 20 hours/week of work during study, and extends post-study work to 3 years for science, technology, engineering and mathematics graduates and 4 years for doctorates, as well as a 1,000-place Working Holiday scheme, and you’ve stitched the “living bridge” of a 300,000-strong Indian diaspora into the economic fabric.\n\nCritics — some inside New Zealand’s politics — have argued that these mobility channels “give too much away.” That is an entirely incorrect framing, though. Global trade today is not a container-ship contest; it is a talent distribution contest. When shortages hobble hospitals, classrooms and infrastructure sites, partnering with a country that supplies trained professionals under transparent, targeted and time-bound rules is not a concession for New Zealand; it is capacity building.\n\nFor India, talent mobility is not brain drain but instead brain circulation. Earnings, networks and know-how will eventually come home, while remittances in the interim can help stabilize families. Far from “giving away” jobs, this agreement allows New Zealand to fill gaps that its own workforce cannot meet. At the same time, the pathways it opens enable Indian professionals to gain global experience and return with skills that strengthen India’s economy — further enhancing India’s international reputation as a source of reliable, high-quality talent.\n\nThe FTA also does the dull yet decisive things right. Customs modernization commits India to 48-hour release windows at the border. That single clause can save exporters more money than many tariff cuts, because time itself can act as a shadow tariff. The pact hardwires cooperation on standards and sanitary rules and creates Agri-Technology Action Plans for kiwifruit, apples and honey. These plans mean both countries will collaborate on sharing best practices — needless to say, India will be the beneficiary.\n\nAdditionally, the agreement requires New Zealand to update its Geographical Indications (GI) framework, thereby granting India the same rights as the EU to register wines, spirits and other goods, ensuring full parity in GI protection. Regulatory access for pharmaceuticals, medical devices and organic products has also been streamlined, reducing duplication and accelerating approvals.\n\nThere is also long-term capital behind this agreement: New Zealand has pledged $ 20 billion in investment in India over the next 15 years. The scale of this commitment signals confidence in India’s economic trajectory and its potential as a global growth engine. The agreement also includes a rebalancing clause that allows India to take remedial measures if the delivery of investments falls short of its commitments. India has learned that FTAs without real capital and capability often disappoint; this one addresses both, the kind of long-term backbone that many earlier agreements lacked.\n\nOf course, no agreement is without its challenges. The FTA will require careful implementation and timely ratification, efficient visa processing, and real delivery on its various Agri-tech and customs commitments.\n\nBut from an Indian perspective, the fundamentals are solid: the deal is structured to maximize opportunity while safeguarding core interests. It is precisely the template India should look to replicate — combining asymmetric access to goods that favors MSMEs with ambitious services and talent mobility. It is bilateralism that looks beyond tariffs, focusing instead on people, productivity and a true sense of partnership.\n\nIndia’s new trade architecture is not merely about opening doors but about building bridges among economies, nations and, above all, people. In that vein, the India-New Zealand FTA is a blueprint for how the next decade of Indian trade can and should be built.\n\n[Kaitlyn Diana edited this piece.]\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Fair Observer’s editorial policy.\n\nWe rely on your support for our independence, diversity and quality.\n\nFor more than 10 years, Fair Observer has been free, fair and independent.

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI/BRUSSELS, Jan 25 (Reuters) - India plans to slash tariffs on cars imported from the European Union to 40% from as high as 110%, sources said, in the biggest opening yet of the country's vast ​market as the two sides close in on a free trade pact that could come as early as Tuesday.\n\nPrime Minister ‌Narendra Modi's government has agreed to immediately reduce the tax on a limited number of cars from the 27-nation bloc with an import price of more than 15,000 euros ($17,739), ‌two sources briefed on the talks told Reuters.\n\nThis will be further lowered to 10% over time, they added, easing access to the Indian market for European automakers such as Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and BMW.\n\nThe sources declined to be identified as the talks are confidential and could be subject to last-minute changes. India's commerce ministry and the European Commission declined to comment.\n\nPACT ALREADY DUBBED 'MOTHER OF ALL DEALS'\n\nIndia and the EU are expected to announce on Tuesday the ⁠conclusion of protracted negotiations for the free trade ‌pact, after which the two sides will finalise the details and ratify what is being called \"the mother of all deals.\n\nThe pact could expand bilateral trade and lift Indian exports of goods such as textiles and jewellery, which ‍have been hit by 50% U.S. tariffs since late August.\n\nIndia is the world's third-largest car market by sales after the U.S. and China, but its domestic auto industry has been one of the most protected. New Delhi currently levies tariffs of 70% and 110% on imported cars, a level often criticised by executives, ​including Tesla chief Elon Musk.\n\nNew Delhi has proposed slashing import duties to 40% immediately for about 200,000 combustion-engine cars a year, one ‌of the sources said, its most aggressive move yet to open up the sector. This quota could be subject to last-minute changes, the source added.\n\nBattery electric vehicles will be excluded from import duty reductions for the first five years to protect investments by domestic players like Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors in the nascent sector, the two sources said. After five years EVs will follow similar duty cuts.\n\nMARKET CURRENTLY DOMINATED BY SUZUKI AND LOCAL MAKERS\n\nLower import taxes will be a boost for European automakers such as Volkswagen, Renault and Stellantis, as well as luxury players ⁠Mercedes-Benz and BMW which locally manufacture cars in India but have struggled to grow ​beyond a point in part due to high tariffs.\n\nLower taxes will allow carmakers to ​sell imported vehicles for a cheaper price and test the market with a broader portfolio before committing to manufacturing more cars locally, said one of the two sources.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 23 (Reuters) - India will seek to triple the nation's exports by 2035 by boosting manufacturing through structural changes rather than with hefty spending, according to two government ​officials.\n\nIn Prime Minister Narendra Modi's third such attempt, the South Asian nation is prioritising manufacturing in 15 sectors, including ‌high-end semiconductors, metals and the labour-intensive leather industry, aiming to lift India's growth and boost annual goods exports to $1.3 trillion, they said.\n\nModi's government has twice failed to ‌double the share of manufacturing to 25% of gross domestic product - with a \"Make in India\" campaign in 2014 and a $23 billion package of incentives in 2020.\n\n\"In past years, several government initiatives to boost manufacturing growth have led to modest, incremental progress at best. What is needed is a bold, focused and cohesive strategy to drive transformative change,\" according to a government official involved in drafting the policy.\n\nMODEST FUNDING ⁠TO BE DECIDED BY GOVERNMENT PANEL\n\nThe government will ‌spend about 100 billion rupees ($1 billion) to build infrastructure for about 30 manufacturing hubs across the targeted sectors while providing grants of $218 million for advanced areas such as chips and energy storage, said ‍the officials, who asked not to be named because they were not authorised to speak to media.\n\nThe Finance Ministry and government think tank NITI Aayog, which is tasked with preparing the policy, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nFunding this time is modest as the plan focuses on easing ​regulatory and compliance burdens, the biggest impediment to Indian manufacturing, rather than doling out subsidies, the officials said.\n\nFinancial support to ‌industries will be decided case by case with recommendations from a new government panel to administrative departments, replacing the pre-budget fiscal packages of earlier schemes, they said.\n\nThe new structure, called the National Manufacturing Mission, was announced in the budget last year but details were not disclosed. Details could be announced in the budget on February 1, but that will be decided closer to the date, the officials said.\n\nThe panel's focus will be to ensure faster regulatory clearance, approvals for land and cheaper financing for ⁠large projects, the officials said. It will be chaired by a minister ​and composed of bureaucrats, including the cabinet secretary, they said.\n\nIt will oversee the ​building of manufacturing hubs for the 15 sectors, and work with state governments to assure steady and cheap electricity supplies for such units, the sources said.",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW, Jan 23 (Reuters) - China is set to ramp up imports of Russian oil in January, absorbing barrels that would have previously gone to India ​and Turkey, as tougher Western sanctions force Moscow to redirect flows, LSEG data ‌and traders said.\n\nThe United States and the European Union imposed sweeping sanctions in late 2025 targeting Russian oil ‌sellers and shippers, including energy giants Rosneft and Lukoil, complicating purchases for global buyers and tightening scrutiny on Russian crude exports.\n\nChina is poised to receive nearly 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of Russian oil by sea this month, compared with 1.1 million bpd in December, according to ⁠preliminary LSEG data. Beijing, already ‌a key consumer of Russian Far East ESPO Blend, also boosted imports of Russian Urals oil to a record high of 405,000 bpd ‍in January, the highest since mid-2023, data provided by energy consultancy Kpler showed.\n\nIndia, previously the largest buyer of Russian Urals by sea since the EU embargo on Moscow's oil in 2022, slashed purchases ​to below 1 million bpd in December, down from an average of 1.3 million ‌bpd last year, LSEG data showed. Indian refiners are expected to keep Russian oil imports near 1 million bpd in January as they diversify supply sources.\n\nTurkey, also a major Russian oil buyer, reduced Urals imports in January to about 250,000 bpd, compared to an average of 275,000 bpd in 2025 and well below the record 400,000 bpd reached in June ⁠last year.\n\n\"As Indian and Turkish buyers cut purchases ​recently, some Russian Urals cargoes headed for China,\" said ​a trader involved in Russian oil sales. He added that the surplus of Urals barrels weighed on prices.\n\nDiscounts for Urals crude delivered to China ‍in late 2025 widened ⁠to as much as $12 per barrel below ICE Brent for some cargoes, while current Urals differentials hover near minus $10 to the benchmark, according to two traders active ⁠in the Asian market.\n\nDemand for Urals in India and Turkey, both major exporters of diesel to Europe, slumped ‌due to the EU ban on fuels produced from Russian-origin crude, the ‌traders added.",

    "title": "Hollywood Try to Take Pirate Sites Down Globally Through Indian Court",
    "description": "The High Court in New Delhi, India, has granted another pirate site blocking order in favor of American movie industry giants.",
    "fullText": "Pirate sites and services can be a real challenge for rightsholders to deal with. In India, however, recent court orders have proven to be quite effective.\n\nIndian courts have issued pirate site blocking orders for over a decade. Initially, these orders were relatively basic, requiring local Internet providers to block specific domain names.\n\nThese regular injunctions were only partially effective. After the High Court granted a blocking injunction, pirate sites would often switch to new domains, requiring rightsholders to return to court to get these blocked as well.\n\nTo deal with this problem, the dynamic injunction was invented. These orders were issued to more effectively deny access to content made available on pirate sites. ISPs were not only required to block original domains but also any clones and mirror sites that surfaced after the order was signed.\n\nWhen dynamic injunctions were no longer sufficient to slay the piracy hydra, rightsholders suggested upgrading the Indian blocking regime with Dynamic ++ injunctions. These orders also protect copyrighted content that has yet to be registered.\n\nIn addition, Dynamic++ orders and their ‘superlative‘ variant also include domain name registrars as defendants. This includes blocking orders targeted at U.S. domain registrars.\n\nThe ability to target domain name registrants proved to be a game changer. Over the past two years, it allowed rightsholders to disable domains of various prominent pirate sites, some with dozens of millions of visitors. While these sites could simply register new domains, the legal efforts certainly affected their operation.\n\nFor this reason, it is no surprise to see that several American movie industry players have ramped up their enforcement actions in India, targeting hundreds of domains at a time. And since these orders effectively suspend domains at various domain name registrars, new requests keep coming in.\n\nAs reported by Verdictum a few days ago, the High Court in New Delhi issued a new blocking injunction on December 18, targeting more than 150 pirate site domains, including yflix.to, animesuge.bz, bs.to, and many others.\n\nThe complaint is filed by Warner Bros., Apple, Crunchyroll, Disney, and Netflix, which are all connected to the MPA’s anti-piracy arm, ACE. The referenced works include some of the most pirated titles, such as Stranger Things, Squid Game, and Silo.\n\nIn addition to targeting Indian ISPs, the order also lists various domain name registries and related organizations as defendants. This includes American registrars such as Namecheap and GoDaddy, but also the government of the Kingdom of Tonga, which is linked to .to domains.\n\nIn addition to suspending the domain names within three days days, the domain name registrars are given four weeks to disclose the relevant subscriber information connected to these domains.\n\n“[The registrars] shall lock and suspend Defendant Nos. 1 to 47 websites within 72 hours of being communicated with a copy of this Order and shall file all the Basic Subscriber Information, including the name, address, contact information, email addresses, bank details, IP logs, and any other relevant information […] within four weeks of being communicated with a copy of this Order,” the High Court wrote.\n\nWhile the “Dynamic+” injunction is designed to be a global kill switch, its effectiveness depends entirely on the cooperation of the domain name registrars. Since most of these are based outside of India, their compliance is not guaranteed.\n\nAccording to our analysis, it appears that most domain names have not been suspended. These pirate sites domains continue to be accessible today. Some continue running from their original domains, while others redirect to new ones, suggesting that they remain controlling their original owners.\n\nThis includes domains that are linked to Namecheap, Tucows, GoDaddy, NameSilo, Dynadot, OVH and others. The government of the Kingdom of Tonga did not comply with the Indian court order either.\n\nAs far as we can see, domains linked to the American registrar Porkbun, the UK-based WHG Hosting services, and the Lithuanian registrar Hostinger were fully suspended. Registrar.eu also put some domains on clientHold, and the one that remains accessible (animesuge.bz) is linked to Namecheap now.\n\nIt’s not unprecedented for foreign companies, including American ones, not to comply with Indian court orders. However, in this case, it is worth noting that Namecheap previously appeared to comply with similar orders from the Delhi High Court.\n\nThe non-compliance must come as a disappointment to Netflix, Warner Bros. and the others. However, they will likely be back in court for more blocking and suspension orders soon enough.\n\nAll in all, it is clear that India’s High Court has a streamlined process in place that effectively orders local ISPs to block pirate sites. However, the intended global reach seems to be restricted to a few registrars, for now.\n\nA copy of the High Court order, issued on December 18, 2025, by Justice Tejas Karia, is available here (pdf). The court order includes 163 unique domain names, some of which are not linked to a registrar. An overview of the 125 domains that are linked to targeted registrars and related entities is provided below. .",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 23 (Reuters) - India can leverage its growing energy demand to negotiate better oil and gas ​supply deals, Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Friday, ‌as its refiners continue seeking alternatives to Russian oil.\n\nIndia became the top buyer of discounted ‌Russian seaborne crude after Moscow's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, but challenges posed by Western sanctions eventually prompted Indian refiners to increase imports from other sources.\n\nIndian officials have been careful to avoid directly referencing Russian oil ⁠imports, but Puri said ‌supplies from \"one source\" that had surged after February 2022, were now easing.\n\nData obtained from trade sources showed India's Russian ‍oil imports fell to their lowest level in two years in December, lifting OPEC's share of imports to an 11-month high.\n\nIndia's rising oil demand gives it \"a ​little bit of positioning inside the world\" to negotiate better deals, ‌Puri said.\n\nThe world's third-largest oil importer and consumer should have no trouble covering its needs given ample global supplies and rising output in countries such as Brazil, Guyana, Suriname and the United States.\n\nIndian refiners have been buying more oil from Middle Eastern, African and South American ⁠countries to make up for a drop ​in Russian oil imports, which is expected ​to help India negotiate a tariff deal with Washington.\n\nPuri said Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd had doubled the size of its ‍annual contract with ⁠Brazil's Petrobras.\n\nIndian Oil Corp, the country's top refiner, has bought 7 million barrels of oil, including from Brazil's Petrobras, for March ⁠loading to replace Russian oil, trade sources said.\n\nIOC last month bought its first Colombian ‌oil and for the first time bought Ecuadorean Oriente crude.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Nidhi VermaEditing by Tomasz Janowski)",

North Korea, for example, is one of the world's most repressive states, led by a dictator who has repeatedly threatened neighboring South Korea.\n\nThe number of active-duty military personnel is far from the only factor that matters when comparing military power between countries, but it shows latent power that could be augmented via conscription and calling up reservists.\n\n\"Numbers have value, but there's a lot more to military capability,\" said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, DC-based foreign policy and national security think tank.\n\nIISS, a London-headquartered think tank, counts active armed forces, reservists, and paramilitaries as separate categories in its analysis, showing a fuller picture of each nation's manpower.\n\nSome countries have significantly higher numbers of reservists than others — Vietnam has the largest number in the world, estimated at 5 million.\n\nBut while reservists can aid militaries when needed, the quality and longevity of their expertise can vary between conscription- and volunteer-based systems, Cancian told Business Insider.\n\n\"When you look at some countries' reserve numbers, you're often looking at people who haven't trained in 10 or 20 years,\" he said. \"It gives you a big number, but their military value is questionable.\"\n\nAnd while paramilitaries can be effective at enforcing internal security and party strength, Cancian says that \"as a military force, they have essentially zero value.\"\n\nEven when accounting for all of a military's manpower, personnel is only one of the various factors that can qualify a nation's military strength, which also include equipment and readiness.\n\nThere's also the role of technologies in global warfare, the size and sophistication of air forces and naval fleets, amphibious capabilities to land assault forces, command and control systems, or nuclear forces, which all shape military power. Larger and more advanced forces require higher state expenditures.\n\nStill, comparing global manpower offers insight into how countries prioritize military power.\n\nSee how the world's largest militaries stack up.",

    "title": "What is Nipah virus? Symptoms to watch out for as India races to contain deadly outbreak",
    "description": "Nipah is a deadly virus with no vaccine or cure and considered a high-risk pathogen by the World Health Organization",
    "fullText": "India is moving quickly to contain a Nipah virus outbreak in the eastern state of West Bengal after five cases were confirmed, including doctors and nurses who were infected.\n\nNearly 100 people have been asked to quarantine at home, and infected patients were being treated in hospitals in and around the capital Kolkata, according to local media reports, with one patient in a critical condition.\n\nNipah is a deadly virus with no vaccine or cure and is considered a high-risk pathogen by the World Health Organization. Experts say human infections are rare and usually occur when the virus spills over from bats, often through contaminated fruit.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this virus:\n\nNipah virus (NiV) infection most often begins with non-specific symptoms, making early detection difficult.\n\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the incubation period is generally believed to range from four to 21 days, though longer delays between exposure and illness have been reported in rare cases during previous outbreaks.\n\nPatients typically develop a sudden flu-like illness marked by fever, headache, muscle pain and fatigue. In some cases, respiratory symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath or pneumonia also occur, although the timing and severity of these symptoms can vary widely.\n\nThe most serious and defining complication of Nipah infection is inflammation of the brain, known as encephalitis. Neurological symptoms, including confusion, altered consciousness, seizures or coma, usually appear several days to weeks after the initial onset of illness.\n\nSome patients may also develop meningitis.\n\nNipah virus is associated with a high death rate, with fatality levels reported between 40 and 75 per cent depending on the outbreak and the viral strain involved.\n\nSurvivors may experience long-term neurological effects, such as persistent seizures or changes in personality, according to the UK Health Security Agency’s update.\n\nIn rare cases, encephalitis has been reported to recur months or even years after the initial infection, either due to relapse or reactivation of the virus.\n\nNipah virus is a zoonotic pathogen that can be transmitted from animals to humans and from person to person, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe primary natural carriers are fruit bats (Pteropus species); humans can become infected through direct contact with infected bats or other animals, or by consuming food contaminated with bat saliva, urine or faeces.\n\nHuman‑to‑human transmission has also been reported, particularly through close contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.\n\nNipah virus (NiV) was first identified in 1999 after an outbreak of encephalitis and respiratory illness among pig farmers and others who had close contact with infected pigs in Malaysia and Singapore. The episode led to the recognition of NiV as a serious zoonotic pathogen capable of crossing from animals to humans.\n\nSince then, repeated outbreaks have been recorded in South Asia. Parts of northeast India and several districts in Bangladesh have reported cases, with Bangladesh experiencing outbreaks almost every year since 2001.\n\nIn southern India, the state of Kerala reported its first Nipah outbreak in 2018, followed by sporadic cases in subsequent years.\n\nBeyond South Asia, infections have also been reported in the Philippines, with investigations suggesting they were caused by the Nipah virus or a closely related Nipah-like strain.\n\nScientific studies have identified fruit bats as the natural reservoir of the virus. Nipah virus has been isolated from bat urine in Malaysia, and antibodies have been detected in at least 23 bat species across Asia as well as in parts of Africa, including Ghana and Madagascar.\n\nDespite this wide animal reservoir, confirmed human outbreaks have so far been limited to South and Southeast Asia, typically occurring in rural or semi-rural settings where contact between humans, bats and domestic animals is more likely, WHO says.\n\n“Human-to-human transmission of Nipah virus has also been reported among family and caregivers of infected patients,” according to WHO.\n\nThere is currently no proven, targeted treatment for Nipah virus (NiV) infection and no approved vaccine to prevent it.\n\nCare for patients remains largely supportive, focusing on managing symptoms and complications as they arise.\n\nThe virus is listed by the WHO as a priority pathogen under its Research and Development Blueprint, which identifies epidemic threats that require urgent research.\n\nFollow these essential precautions to prevent Nipah Virus infection. Stay alert, stay informed, and follow advisories issued by local health authorities.#NipahVirus #PublicHealth #HealthForAll pic.twitter.com/itTuZA18ev\n\n— Ministry of Health (@MoHFW_INDIA) January 22, 2026\n\nWith no vaccine available, preventing Nipah virus infection relies on awareness and simple protective measures, global health agencies recommend. Public health advice focuses on reducing contact with the virus, whether from bats, animals, or infected people.\n\nPreventing bat-to-human transmission: Bats are the main carriers of Nipah. People should avoid consuming raw date palm sap or fruits that might have been contaminated by bats, WHO guidelines advise.\n\nBoiling fresh date palm juice and thoroughly washing or peeling fruits can reduce risk. Any fruit showing signs of bat bites should be discarded, the health agency advises.\n\nPreventing animal-to-human transmission: People handling sick animals, their tissues, or during slaughter should wear gloves and protective clothing. Contact with infected pigs should be minimised, and pig farms in areas with fruit bats should take steps to protect feed and enclosures from bats.\n\nSymptoms of Nipah Virus in humans can range from fever and headache to respiratory distress and neurological complications.\nEarly recognition of these symptoms and timely medical care are critical to reducing severity and preventing complications.#NipahVirus #HealthAwareness… pic.twitter.com/odW9baGomD\n\n— Ministry of Health (@MoHFW_INDIA) January 20, 2026\n\nPreventing human-to-human transmission: Avoid close, unprotected contact with people infected with Nipah. Regular hand washing after caring for or visiting sick individuals is essential to stop the virus from spreading.\n\nThe 2011 film Contagion, which depicts a fast-spreading global virus, was partly inspired by real-life pathogens like the Nipah virus, a bat-borne virus first identified in Malaysia in 1999, according to global health non-profit Path’s website.\n\nNipah causes severe respiratory illness and brain inflammation (encephalitis) and can spread from animals to humans, contaminated food, or infected people.\n\nIts high fatality rate, potential for outbreaks, and lack of a vaccine made it a model for how a zoonotic virus could trigger a pandemic, which filmmakers used to shape the realistic global crisis in Contagion, Path noted.",

    "fullText": "MUMBAI, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chose a little-known legislator from India's poorest state as ​the party's youngest president on Tuesday, a generational shift ‌in the effort to retain young voters.\n\nNitin Nabin, 45, takes over from outgoing president ‌J.P. Nadda, 65, months before key state elections, one of them in the eastern state of West Bengal, which the BJP has never won and is strongly focused on.\n\nA five-time lawmaker from the eastern state ⁠of Bihar, Nabin was ‌elected unopposed as the party's 12th president after Modi and other leaders proposed him.\n\nHundreds of workers watched at ‍party headquarters in New Delhi as Nabin, his forehead smeared with a vermillion mark and his shoulders wrapped in a scarf with the party symbol, ​took the oath of office before Modi and four past presidents.\n\n\"When ‌it comes to the party, I am a worker and he is my boss,\" Modi, 75, said in his remarks, pointing to Nabin, who will serve a three-year term.\n\nIn his speech, Nabin repeatedly praised Modi as a generational leader and urged young people to take an active ⁠part in politics.\n\nMore than 40% of ​India's one billion voters are aged between ​18 and 39, the Election Commission and analysts estimate.\n\nThe BJP suffered a shock setback in the 2024 general election as ‍Modi lost his ⁠majority after 10 years in power and had to rely on regional allies to form a government.\n\nBut it has since ⁠regained ground, winning critical state and civic body elections.

    "fullText": "MUMBAI/NEW DELHI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - India's central bank has proposed that BRICS countries link their official digital currencies to make cross-border trade and tourism payments easier, two sources said, which could reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar as geopolitical tensions rise.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recommended ​to the government that a proposal connecting the central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) be included on the agenda for the 2026 BRICS summit, the sources said. They requested ‌anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly.\n\nIndia will host the summit, which will be held later this year. If the recommendation is accepted, a proposal to link the digital currencies of BRICS members would be put ‌forward for the first time. The BRICS organisation includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, among others.\n\nThe initiative could irritate the U.S., which has warned against any moves to bypass the dollar.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has previously said the BRICS alliance is \"anti-American\" and he threatened to impose tariffs on its members.\n\nThe RBI, India's central government and the central banks of China, Brazil, and Russia did not respond to emails seeking comment. The South African central bank declined to comment.\n\nThe RBI's proposal to link BRICS' CBDCs for cross-border trade finance and tourism has not been previously reported.\n\nThe ⁠RBI's proposal builds on a 2025 declaration at a BRICS summit ‌in Rio de Janeiro, which pushed for interoperability between members' payment systems to make cross-border transactions more efficient.\n\nThe RBI has publicly expressed interest in linking India's digital rupee with other nations' CBDCs to expedite cross-border transactions and bolster its currency's global usage. It has, however, said its efforts ‍to promote the rupee's global use are not aimed at promoting de-dollarisation.\n\nWhile none of the BRICS members have fully launched their digital currencies, all five main members have been running pilot projects.\n\nIndia's digital currency - called the e-rupee - has attracted a total of 7 million retail users since its launch in December 2022, while China has pledged to boost the international use of the digital yuan.\n\nThe RBI has encouraged the adoption ​of the e-rupee by enabling offline payments, providing programmability for government subsidy transfers and by allowing fintech firms to offer digital currency wallets.\n\nFor the BRICS digital currency linkages to ‌be successful, elements like interoperable technology, governance rules and ways to settle imbalanced trade volumes would be among the discussion topics, one of the sources said.",

    "description": ": Revenue growth is sluggish, too",
    "fullText": "India’s big four outsourcers – HCL, Infosys, TCS and Wipro – have essentially stopped hiring, perhaps coinciding with their increased use of AI to power their practices.\n\nThe four companies have all announced quarterly results in the last ten days and appear to be in decent health. HCL reported $3.8 billion revenue, up 7.4 percent year over year. Infosys pulled in $5.1 billion, up 1.7 percent year over year. TCS revenue of $7.5 billion represented a three percent increase. Wipro’s $2.6 billion revenue represented a 5.5 percent year over year improvement.\n\nIndia’s top tech companies often hire more than 10,000 people a quarter, a rate of recruitment that more-than offsets attrition and sees their headcounts rise substantially. Wipro increased its payroll by 6,500 people last quarter and Infosys hired 5,000 more – muted growth by their standards – while TCS and HCL went backward by 11,000 and 261 people respectively.\n\nOver the last year, the four companies added just 3,910 staff, an unusually slow rate of hiring.\n\nPerhaps coincidentally, all four companies told investors they’re using more AI to deliver services for clients, either by adopting the technology to streamline their own work or by adding it to the tools they deliver to customers. Infosys has gone meta with its efforts, by creating a tool that uses AI to create Global Capability Centers, the company’s term for offshored and/or outsourced operations it runs for clients in India, that use AI to improve customers’ operations.\n\nAll also report that clients are hungry for AI expertise, so they can put the technology to work streamlining their operations. As you would expect, on earnings calls the outsourcers’ execs reached for metrics to describe their success with AI. For HCL that was pointing to 60 of its priority customers adopting one of its AI services. At TCS, the trophy win was using AI to accelerate the pace of software builds for a major client. Wipro is chuffed about the rate of adoption for its AI-infused operations tools WINGS and WEGA.\n\nThe four companies are all hiring people with AI skills as fast as they can find them while also training senior staff who are yet to wrap their heads around the tech, a new twist on the services industry’s balancing act of trying to keep margins high by having inexperienced and low-salaried juniors handle much client work after high-cost seniors lead with consultancy.\n\nInvestors weren’t spooked by what they heard, with the four companies’ share prices steady – other than Infosys, which popped five percent. ®",

    "fullText": "India’s competition watchdog has issued a final warning to Apple in a long-running antitrust case. After more than a year of back-and-forth, the regulator says Apple’s repeated requests for more time are blocking the process.\n\nThe investigation began after a 2022 complaint from Match, the owner of Tinder, and several Indian startups. Regulators later concluded that Apple abused its position in the iOS app market. They then asked Apple to submit objections and share financial data needed to assess penalties.\n\nSince then, the case has stalled. Apple has sought multiple extensions and challenged how any fine would be calculated. As a result, the dispute has remained stuck in legal review.\n\nThe commission noted that it asked Apple in October 2024 to respond to the findings and provide key financial details. However, Apple kept asking for more time. The order states that this cannot continue and warns that the case will move forward even without Apple’s reply.\n\nApple says it could face a fine of up to $38 billion if regulators base penalties on its global revenue. Because of this, the company has challenged the penalty rules in court and asked to pause the antitrust case until judges rule on that issue.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Apple plans to wait for the next court hearing on January 27 before responding. A source familiar with the matter said Apple views the regulator’s move as an attempt to preempt the court process.\n\nIf Apple does not submit its response by the deadline set by the commission, the regulator says it will proceed on its own. That would bring the long-running dispute closer to a decision, even as Apple continues its legal challenge in court.",

    "fullText": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship and Bare Knuckle Fight League are making their official entry into India, marking a significant expansion into one of the world’s largest combat sports markets.\n\nThe move is being spearheaded by World League of Fighters, BKFC’s license holder, which is co-founded by Rajesh Banga, Sunil Mathew and Siraj Gill. The organization has brought in prominent film producer Parag Sanghvi and Bollywood star and martial artist Tiger Shroff to join the board alongside BKFC founder and president David Feldman and former two-division UFC champion Conor McGregor, who became a part-owner of BFKC in 2024.\n\nMiss Universe Harnaaz Sandhu Joins Tiger Shroff, Sanjay Dutt in 'Baaghi 4' - Global Bulletin\n\nNetflix, Amazon Prime, ZEE5, SonyLIV Vie for India's IFFI Streaming Honor - Global Bulletin\n\nFox Orders Lifeguard Drama Series 'Rescue: Hi-Surf' from Producer John Wells (TV News Roundup)\n\nWLF previously delivered a sold-out BKFC event in Dubai last year, which the organization describes as the biggest bare-knuckle fighting event held in the Middle East.\n\nThe India expansion will introduce a team-based bare-knuckle league format – marking the first time such a structure has been implemented in the history of the sport. The format will feature six inaugural teams: Crushers, Punishers, Warriors, Phantoms, Gladiators and Infernos, transforming individual fights into a franchise-based competition.\n\nRahul Saxena has been appointed CEO to lead the platform. He brings experience in scaling global brands to the role.\n\n“India is not just a market – it is the future of global combat sports,” Banga, Mathew and Gill said in a joint statement. “Together with BKFC, BKFL and WLF, we are building an ecosystem that will develop Indian fighters, create global stars and deliver world-class fight entertainment to millions of fans.”\n\nSanghvi positioned the venture as an opportunity to build a sports intellectual property from India with global reach. “This is where world-class storytelling meets raw, uncompromising sport,” he said. “With WLF, BKFC and Conor McGregor, we are not just launching a league – we are architecting a global sports IP from India that will command attention, talent and fandom worldwide.”\n\nFeldman emphasized India’s longstanding position in the organization’s expansion strategy. “India has been on our roadmap for a long time,” he said. “The scale, the energy, the culture — there is no place like it. With the leadership team we have assembled and our partnership with WLF, we are bringing the purest form of combat sports to a nation ready for it.”\n\nMcGregor, who serves as a global partner for BKFC, framed the expansion as transformative. “India has warriors in its DNA,” he said. “What we’re building with BKFC and BKFL in India will be something the world has never seen before. This is not just expansion – this is a revolution.”\n\nShroff, joining McGregor as a board member, highlighted the cultural significance of the venture. “Honored to stand alongside Conor McGregor as we create something truly historic for Indian sport,” he said. “This is more than a fight – it’s a global movement, and history is being written. Just like cinema, sport is a celebration of talent and skill, and Parag [Sanghvi] and I are committed to turning this into a landmark moment for India.”\n\nThe first official BKFC and BKFL team-based events are scheduled for 2026, with venue and fight card details to be announced.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nOscar Predictions: Original Screenplay — With Few Signals, 'Sinners' Takes an Early Lead\n\nOscar Predictions: ‘Sinners’ Could Shatter the All-Time Nomination Record as International Films Hope for Recognition\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week",

    "fullText": "Virat Kohli isn’t arrogant, says India star Ajinkya Rahane, but his focus is misconstrued by others.\n\nAjinkya Rahane has stepped forward to challenge the persistent claims of arrogance levelled at Virat Kohli, offering a perspective from someone who has seen the former India captain’s routines up close.\n\nA teammate of Kohli’s during the latter’s time as Indian captain, Rahane explained that Kohli’s intense focus before matches is a sign of discipline and preparation, not ego.\n\nSpeaking to Cricbuzz, Ajinkya Rahane described how Kohli’s pre-match habits — including isolating himself and listening to music — are part of a process that helps him get into the right mental space.\n\nRahane also praised Kohli’s work ethic, saying it’s his constant drive to improve that sets him apart from others.\n\n“He’ll hardly talk with people, even with the teammates. That’s what actually gets him into the zone. People outside think Virat is arrogant, but he is not. He gets into the zone.”\n\n“His attitude is amazing. His work ethics are amazing. He always wants to change, improve, and contribute for the team,” Rahane said.\n\nVirat Kohli’s career has been defined by the level of effort, commitment, and focus he has brought to every team and every format of the game.\n\nKohli’s focus has been a talking point among fans and critics for years, but teammates have often described it as a key part of his success.\n\nNow playing only limited-overs cricket, Kohli recently became the second-highest run-scorer in international history, with 28,068 runs, following a 93-run innings against New Zealand.\n\nRahane’s comments echo what many within the Indian setup have said before: Kohli’s intensity is often misread, but it’s that same approach that has helped him build one of the most impressive careers in modern cricket.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 11 (Reuters) - India proposes requiring smartphone makers to share source code with the government and make several software changes as part of a raft of security measures, prompting behind-the-scenes opposition from giants like Apple and Samsung.\n\nThe tech companies ​have countered that the package of 83 security standards, which would also include a requirement to alert the government to major software updates, ‌lacks any global precedent and risks revealing proprietary details, according to four people familiar with the discussions and a Reuters review of confidential government and industry documents.\n\nThe plan is part of Prime Minister Narendra ‌Modi's efforts to boost security of user data as online fraud and data breaches increase in the world's second-largest smartphone market, with nearly 750 million phones.\n\nIT Secretary S. Krishnan told Reuters that \"any legitimate concerns of the industry will be addressed with an open mind\", adding it was \"premature to read more into it\". A ministry spokesperson said it could not comment further due to ongoing consultation with tech companies on the proposals.\n\nONGOING TUG OF WAR OVER GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS\n\nApple, South Korea's Samsung, Google, China's Xiaomi and MAIT, the Indian ⁠industry group that represents the firms, did not respond ‌to requests for comment.\n\nIndian government requirements have irked technology firms before. Last month it revoked an order mandating a state-run cyber safety app on phones amid concerns over surveillance. But the government brushed aside lobbying last year and required rigorous testing for security ‍cameras over fears of Chinese spying.\n\nXiaomi and Samsung - whose phones use Google's Android operating system - hold 19% and 15%, respectively, of India's market share and Apple 5%, Counterpoint Research estimates.\n\nAmong the most sensitive requirements in the new Indian Telecom Security Assurance Requirements is access to source code - the underlying programming instructions that make phones work. This would be analysed and possibly ​tested at designated Indian labs, the documents show.\n\nThe Indian proposals also require companies to make software changes to allow pre-installed apps to be uninstalled and to ‌block apps from using cameras and microphones in the background to \"avoid malicious usage\".\n\n\"Industry raised concerns that globally security requirement have not been mandated by any country,\" said a December IT ministry document detailing meetings that officials held with Apple, Samsung, Google and Xiaomi.\n\nThe security standards, drafted in 2023, are in the spotlight now as the government is considering imposing them legally. IT ministry and tech executives are due to meet on Tuesday for more discussions, sources said.\n\nCOMPANIES SAY SOURCE CODE REVIEW, ANALYSIS 'NOT POSSIBLE'\n\nSmartphone makers closely guard their source code. Apple declined China's request for source code between 2014 and 2016, and U.S. law enforcement has also tried and failed to ⁠get it.\n\nIndia's proposals for \"vulnerability analysis\" and \"source code review\" would require smartphone makers to perform a \"complete ​security assessment\", after which test labs in India could check their claims through source code review and ​analysis.\n\n\"This is not possible ... due to secrecy and privacy,\" MAIT said in a confidential document drafted in response to the government proposal, and seen by Reuters. \"Major countries in the EU, North America, Australia and Africa do not mandate these requirements.\"\n\nMAIT asked the ministry last ‍week to drop the proposal, a source ⁠with direct knowledge said.\n\nThe Indian proposals would mandate automatic and periodic malware scanning on phones. Device makers would also have to inform the National Centre for Communication Security about major software updates and security patches before releasing them to users, and the centre would have the right to test them.\n\nMAIT's ⁠document says regular malware scanning significantly drains a phone's battery and seeking government approval for software updates is \"impractical\" as they need to be issued promptly.\n\nIndia also wants the phone's logs - digital records ‌of its system activity - to be stored for at least 12 months on the device.\n\n\"There is not enough room on device to store ‌1-year log events,\" MAIT said in the document.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Below are key security requirements India is proposing for smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung, prompting ​opposition from tech companies, according to four sources, as well as industry and government ‌documents seen by Reuters.\n\nManufacturers must test and provide proprietary source code for review by government-designated labs to ‌identify vulnerabilities in phone operating systems that could be exploited by attackers.\n\nIndustry group MAIT, which represents Apple, South Korea's Samsung, Google, China's Xiaomi, has told the government this is \"not possible\" due to corporate secrecy and global privacy policies.\n\nBACKGROUND PERMISSION RESTRICTIONS:\n\nApps cannot access cameras, microphones or location services in ⁠the background when phones are inactive. ‌Continuous status bar notifications are required when these permissions are active.\n\nManufacturers say this lacks any global precedent and there is no specific test method ‍prescribed.\n\nDevices must periodically display warnings prompting users to review all app permissions, with continuous notifications. Companies say notice should be limited to \"highly critical\" permissions.\n\nDevices must store security audit logs, including ​app installations and login attempts, for 12 months.\n\nMAIT argues consumer phones lack the storage capacity ‌for a year of data.\n\nPhones must periodically scan for malware and identify potentially harmful applications.\n\nManufacturers warn that constant on-device scanning significantly drains the battery and slows hardware performance.\n\nOPTION TO REMOVE PRE-INSTALLED APPS:\n\nAll pre-installed apps bundled with the phone operating system, except those essential for basic phone functions, must be deletable.\n\nCompanies argue many apps are critical system components that cannot be ⁠removed.\n\nINFORMING GOVERNMENT OF MAJOR UPDATES:\n\nPhone makers must notify a ​government organisation before releasing any major updates or security ​patches.\n\nManufacturers argue this is \"impractical\" because security fixes must be released quickly to protect users from active exploits, while government delays could leave users vulnerable.\n\nDevices ‍must detect if phones have ⁠been rooted or \"jailbroken\", where users bypass built-in security restrictions, and display continuous warning banners to recommend corrective measures.\n\nCompanies say there is no reliable mechanism to detect jailbreaking.\n\nPhones ⁠must permanently block installation of older software versions, even if officially signed by the manufacturer, to prevent security ‌downgrades.\n\nThere is no global standard related to this requirement, manufacturers say.",

Around 3,500 pieces of content were blocked, and over 600 accounts were deleted. Going forward, X will not allow obscene imagery,\" government sources told news agency ANI.Govt Sends Notice To Elon Musk's X On Grok AI Chatbot Misuse, IT Ministry Seeks Action ReportThe Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) had raised concerns over obscene and harmful content allegedly generated by Elon Musk’s chatbot Grok. The ministry sent a letter to X (formerly Twitter), the social media website owned by Elon Musk, pointing out failures in moderating AI-generated content on its platform. The ministry highlighted concerns that the Grok and other services of xAI have been used to generate and distribute obscene or non-consensual images, particularly targeting the dignity and privacy of women. Through the letter, the government has also sought a report on the actions taken by the company, and the immediate removal of illegal materials.ALSO READ | AI tool to 'undress women': Grok under fire for generating non-consensual sexualised images; Musk pokes funNow, X has submitted a reply to the ministry, however, the officials described it as ‘not adequate’, saying the response by the social media platform lacked specific actions taken and preventive steps implemented.Earlier, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi had written to IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, urging the government to urgently step in over what she described as a disturbing rise in the misuse of AI tools to sexualise women on social media, particularly on X.In her letter, Priyanka Chaturvedi called for strict “guardrails” on AI chatbots such as Grok, saying social media platforms must be made “a safe space for women”. She also underlined the need for better education of men from an early age to prevent such behaviour.“Have sought urgent attention and intervention of the IT Minister to take the issue of increasing incidents of AI apps being prompted to sexualise and undress women by unauthorised use of their images on social media,” Chaturvedi said in a post on X.In the letter shared publicly, the Shiv Sena (UBT) leader flagged what she called an emerging trend on X, where men operating fake accounts allegedly upload photos of women and use AI prompts to minimise their clothing or sexualise them.“It is not just limited to sharing photos through fake accounts but are also targeting women who post their own photos,” she wrote.Calling the practice an “unacceptable and gross misuse of an AI function,” Chaturvedi also criticised Grok for “enabling this behaviour by adhering to such requests”.She described such acts as a “breach of women's right to privacy” and termed them “criminal”, adding that similar instances were “going absolutely unchecked” across other platforms as well.ALSO READ | Elon Musk's Grok AI restricts image editing features to paid X users after Deepfakes go viral across the world",

    "description": "As someone born and raised in India, I've seen a lot of first-time visitors make avoidable mistakes when planning trips, eating street food, and more.",
    "fullText": "As someone who's lived in India my whole life, I've seen it all: the chaos of a Delhi market at noon, the quiet streets of a Rajasthan village, and the seemingly endless railway platforms where people jostle for a spot on a train.\n\nVisitors often come expecting a single \"India experience,\" but having lived in big cities and small towns, I know that the country changes every few hundred miles.\n\nWith different cuisine and customs in every part of the country, it's no wonder first-time visitors to India are often unprepared. Here are the mistakes I see tourists make again and again — and how to avoid them.\n\nMany first-timers fly into Delhi, rush to Agra for the Taj Mahal, and then stop in Jaipur for forts and palaces, believing they've \"done India.\"\n\nThis route, known as the \"Golden Triangle,\" is iconic, but it's also one of the country's most crowded tourist circuits, where hourslong lines and heavy traffic can overshadow the experience.\n\nThat fast, checklist style of travel shows only one version of India: frenetic, historic, and packed with people.\n\nInstead, I'd recommend ditching the crowds and exploring other areas. Some of my favorite underrated parts of India include the cold deserts of Ladakh and Spiti.\n\nDon't skip rural India, either. Well over half of India's population lives in villages, and in my opinion, spending time in one can teach you more about the country than any monument.\n\nWalking through a small-town market and chatting with local families can give tourists a real sense of daily life.\n\nMany travelers try to see all of India in just one or two weeks, but getting from one city to another can take most of a day due to traffic, road conditions, or transportation delays.\n\nPlus, it'll be harder to enjoy everything India has to offer if you're frequently exhausted from a grueling travel experience.\n\nI believe it's better to focus on one city or state at a time.\n\nFor example, you can spend two weeks in Kerala exploring canals, stunning hills, and spice plantations; meanwhile, a trip to Rajasthan can include visits to many colorful cities and the fresco-rich Shekhawati region.\n\nMost travelers skip street food, fearing \"Delhi Belly\" — that is, traveler's diarrhea — but doing so means missing some of India's iconic local flavors.\n\nEach city has its specialties, from Mumbai's vada pav (a potato fritter between buns) to Varanasi's chaat (a savory street snack) to Kolkata's kathi rolls (a kebab rolled inside a flatbread with onions and sauce).\n\nTo enjoy street food safely, I recommend generally following the crowds, since high turnover usually means fresh food.\n\nI'd also suggest avoiding consuming anything cold or raw unless you can peel it yourself, and refraining from using ice unless it's made from bottled water — tap water isn't safe to drink here.\n\nIf you're nervous, you can also book a guided street-food tour. These are available in most major cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Jaipur, and Varanasi.\n\nIndia is famously hospitable: The Sanskrit saying \"Atithi Devo Bhava,\" or \"the guest is god,\" exists for a reason.\n\nThat said, paying attention to some basic customs doesn't take much effort, and it will likely make your interactions smoother and earn you some goodwill.\n\nAcross the country, it's respectful to remove shoes before entering temples or homes, and also to dress modestly, especially in rural areas and religious sites.\n\nI'd also recommend avoiding public displays of affection, as it can make some locals uncomfortable. Finally, use your right hand for eating or passing items, since the left is traditionally considered unclean.\n\nWith 28 states and eight union territories, India's customs can vary widely, so it's also wise to check local etiquette before your trip.\n\nSo much in India runs on WhatsApp messages and OTPs (one-time passwords), so you'll need a local SIM to pay for a cab ride or buy train tickets.\n\nI suggest buying a SIM card at the airport upon arrival, or using an eSIM. Preload it with enough data for your entire trip; adding more later can sometimes be tricky with foreign cards.\n\nWhile you're at it, take out some cash, too. The Indian rupee is our only official currency, and although many shops and restaurants accept digital payments, it's smart to carry cash for smaller vendors at local markets.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 8 (Reuters) - India's finance ministry plans to scrap five-year-old restrictions on Chinese firms bidding for government contracts, two sources said, as New Delhi seeks ​to revive commercial ties in an environment of eased diplomatic and border tensions.\n\nThe curbs, imposed in 2020 ‌after a deadly clash between the countries' troops, required Chinese bidders to register with an Indian government committee and obtain political and security clearances.\n\nThe ‌measures effectively barred Chinese firms from competing for Indian government contracts that were estimated to be worth $700 billion to $750 billion.\n\n\"Officials are working to remove the registration requirement for bidders from bordering nations,\" one government source said, declining to be named as they were not authorised to speak publicly.\n\nThe final decision will be made by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office, both the ⁠sources said.\n\nThe restrictions had a significant ‌impact: Months after they were unveiled, China's state-owned CRRC was disqualified from bidding for a $216 million train-manufacturing contract.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance's plan to ease curbs followed requests from other government departments ‍that are facing shortages and project delays due to the 2020 restrictions.\n\n\"Several ministries have requested exemptions to overcome the constraints that could derail projects in their sectors,\" the second government source said.\n\nSoon after India imposed its restrictions, the value of new projects awarded to ‌Chinese bidders fell 27% from a year earlier to $1.67 billion in 2021, according to a 2024 report from the Observer Research Foundation.\n\nSpecifically, curbs on imports from China of equipment for the power sector have hindered India's plans to raise its thermal power capacity to about 307 GW over the next decade.\n\nA high-level committee headed by a former cabinet secretary, Rajiv Gauba, has also recommended easing the restrictions. Gauba is now a member of a top government think tank.\n\nIndia's finance ministry ⁠and the prime minister's office did not respond to Reuters requests ​for comment.\n\nLast year, Modi visited China for the first time in ​seven years and agreed to foster deeper commercial ties with Beijing following U.S. President Donald Trump's 50% punitive tariff on Indian goods and in light of Washington's warming relations with Pakistan.",

    "fullText": "I used to love coming home from vacation.\n\nThe way the plane would swoop over London's skyscrapers and the River Thames before landing at Heathrow. Returning to my favorite places, people, and my job. Until one day, I burst into tears on a flight home from Italy.\n\nWhen I turned 30, I thought I had it all with a great career in London managing communications for TV networks. Then my long-term relationship ended. Suddenly, I had to find somewhere else to live and learn how to be alone again.\n\nMeanwhile, the job I loved became increasingly demanding. It all took its toll on my health. I felt sick every day: working late, eating sporadically, and waking in a panic at night. Nothing seemed to make a difference — not therapy, new hobbies, or healthier habits.\n\nOne day, friends invited me to go backpacking around Italy. It was the chance to escape my routine and get the fresh perspective I needed, so I joined them in Milan. Together, we explored the country by train: sleeping in hostels, slurping pasta, and dancing into the night.\n\nOn the plane home, watching Milan's russet roofs disappear under the clouds, I couldn't stop the tears. I wanted to stay, as this version of me, one who reminded me of my younger self. When I was a student, I used to walk past a travel agency near my university. I promised myself that one day I'd plan a big adventure. But I never had.\n\nThis spark ignited a long-dormant dream of traveling the world. I worried about abandoning the career I'd worked so hard to achieve. But I couldn't hold on any more to a life I'd fallen out of love with.\n\nI quit my job and booked a round-the-world route spanning nine countries across three continents.\n\nBoarding the plane alone to my first stop in India, I wondered if I'd finally lost my mind.\n\nOn my first morning, I awoke at a beachside yoga resort in Goa, India to the sound of the waves. Even there, so far from home, my anxiety had disturbed my sleep, as if I'd packed it in my backpack.\n\nBut over the next few weeks, practicing yoga and meditation calmed my body and mind. I learned to be spontaneous, to say yes to invitations, and to enjoy the moment. By the time I left a month later, I felt I was leaving behind a piece of my heart.\n\nMy next stop was Malaysia, where I took scuba diving lessons. Struggling to breathe underwater, I panicked and almost gave up. Eventually, I got the hang of it and even passed my diving certification. On my 33rd birthday, I arrived in Bali, where I learned to rest and relax.\n\nMy yearlong route took me to countries including New Zealand, where I got a temp job in communications, climbed volcanoes, and enjoyed barbecues on the beach with new friends. In Chile, I saw shooting stars over the Atacama Desert, as the vast universe looked down on our small planet.\n\nReturning to the UK, my plane circled over London. The city looked the same, but I was different. I had met a guy from Belgium toward the end of my trip; he had just begun his journey.\n\nWe got along so well that we ended up going on trips together and even visited each other in our home countries.\n\nWhen he got his old job back and moved home, I realized how much I'd miss him. So I faced a choice. Put down my roots again in the UK and try a long-distance relationship, or take a chance. I decided to trust myself one more time.\n\nOnce again, I packed my bags, this time for Belgium, a country I'd never considered living in.\n\nI didn't speak the languages and so much was different to what I was used to. But I made friends and rebuilt my communications career in Brussels.\n\nIt's been over 10 years, and we're still together, living in Belgium. Now I enjoy browsing the weekly markets or sitting on a terrace watching the world go by — even the slow service at restaurants that used to drive me mad. I still love to travel, and now I have someone to share the sunsets with and laugh with when things go wrong.\n\nI still get a happy tingle in my stomach when I travel back to London to visit, and that will never change.\n\nThat year taught me that home isn't only about where you're born. It's about where you feel comfortable, through the people and experiences that matter.\n\nYou can create a home more than once, in more than one place.\n\nDo you have a story about taking a gap year that you want to share?

    "description": "Amazon allows India-based employees affected by H-1B visa delays to work remotely until March, with strict restrictions on coding.",
    "fullText": "Amazon is allowing employees who are stranded in India because of visa delays to work remotely there until early March, according to an internal memo viewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe catch: They're not allowed to code, make strategic decisions, or interact with customers.\n\nAmazon is one of many American companies scrambling to adapt to the Trump administration's rapid-fire changes to the H-1B visa program, including a mandate that consular officers must review visa applicants' social media posts before issuing visas. The additional screening has delayed processing, and some embassies and consulates have rescheduled visa appointments by several months, leaving some employees stranded outside the country.\n\nThe delays have prompted Google, Apple, Microsoft, and other companies to issue travel advisories in recent weeks, warning US employees with visas to avoid international travel to prevent extended stays outside the US.\n\nAmazon allows employees traveling abroad for visa renewals to work remotely for up to 20 business days, an exemption from the normal requirement that they work in their office five days a week. Now, any Amazon employee in India as of December 13 and who awaits a rescheduled visa appointment may work remotely until March 2, according to the memo, which was posted to Amazon's internal HR portal on December 17.\n\nThe permission to work remotely comes with a long list of constraints. Employees working remotely from India are barred from coding of any kind, including troubleshooting and testing. They cannot work from or visit Amazon buildings. And they cannot negotiate or sign contracts.\n\n\"All reviews, final decision making, and sign offs should be undertaken outside India,\" the memo says.\n\nThe memo also said that \"in compliance with local laws, there are no exceptions to these restrictions.\"\n\nThe memo does not provide guidance for employees whose visa appointments have been rescheduled beyond March 2, 2026, or for those stranded in a different country. Some US embassies and consulates have rescheduled appointments as far out as 2027.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nFor employees in technical roles, the restrictions raised questions about what work they can actually perform.\n\n\"Seventy to eighty percent of my job is coding, testing, deploying, and documenting,\" one Amazon software engineer told Business Insider.\n\nA State Department spokesperson in December told Business Insider that the purpose of the social media reviews is to use \"all available tools\" to flag visa applicants who are inadmissible, including those who pose a risk to national interests.\n\nThe delays pose a particular challenge for Amazon, which is among the largest users of the H-1B program. During the 2024 government fiscal year, Amazon filed 14,783 certified H-1B applications, including 23 for Whole Foods, according to Business Insider's analysis of publicly available data from the Department of Labor and US Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Ashwini Gangal felt like a trailing spouse when she left her life in India behind to move to the US on a H-4 visa, as her husband's dependant.",
    "fullText": "My husband and I met on a dating app in 2021. He had moved to the US in 2009 and was in Mumbai, where I lived, to visit family.\n\nHis trip marked the start of our whirlwind intercontinental romance. In April 2022, after nearly a year of long-distance dating between the US and India, we got married in Mumbai, where I had spent all 36 years of my life. Nearly six months after the wedding, I moved from high-octane Mumbai to Sunnyvale, a sleepy suburb in San Francisco's Bay Area, leaving my job as the managing editor of an online business publication and bidding my friends and family goodbye. At the time, my husband worked in tech on an H-1B employment visa, which meant I could move to the US on an H-4 dependent spouse visa.\n\nWhen I got to the US, the heady joy of marital bliss was soon eclipsed by a crisis of identity. While I was glad to have found the man of my dreams à la Bollywood, I felt bitter about being a \"trailing spouse,\" moving to a new country for love, at the cost of professional stability. The busy editor who led a team of reporters in Mumbai quickly became an alter ego from a past life. Plus, I was incredibly lonely. It was only after roughly three years in the States that I began to think of Sunnyvale as home.\n\nAs a well-traveled Anglophone, I felt no culture shock when I arrived in America, with the exception of the \"do-it-yourself\" culture common to the Western world. I was a Bombay brat who always had house help to cook and clean for me. In the US, I tortured my gut bacteria with junk food for months before grudgingly learning my way around the kitchen.\n\nIn my head, I thought I'd only take a short break from work following my relocation. It took around six months after landing in the States to get my work authorization, known as the EAD, and then, I was all set to pick up my pen and notepad and return to work as a journalist.\n\nBut I found landing full-time work extremely difficult. Every day, I searched online job portals for journalism roles to apply to, but I was either ghosted or rejected every time.\n\nIsolation made these rejections harder to handle. Friendless \"visa brides,\" as I sometimes call immigrants of my ilk, have no one to share their burdens with.\n\nAlthough I did make friends over time, it was extremely difficult to connect with people initially, because loneliness is baked into suburban Californian life. In contrast to the throbbing metropolis of Mumbai, the Bay Area is quiet and boring, with vast distances between any two places of interest. It's not unusual to have to take multiple freeways to get to a grocery store or restaurant. Some roads don't even have footpaths for you to walk on. Public transport is a joke, so in these soulless suburbs, your car becomes a detachable extension of your body.\n\nA few months into my life in the Bay, I knew I was experiencing something that went beyond homesickness. I cried frequently, sometimes breaking down in public places. I slept badly, worried constantly, and lost my confidence. It felt like I was having a breakdown in slow motion.\n\nLearning how to drive, and getting my license in February 2023, was a big part of my emotional recovery. I'd always been afraid of driving, but now I've overcome it, I'm no longer dependent on my husband for transport. I have at long last befriended the asphalt.\n\nOne of my first long-distance drives was to a town called Turlock, nearly 100 miles from my place, where I did a live poetry reading.\n\nFinancially, I had to depend on my husband while I struggled to find work. But over the past three years, I've picked up some freelance writing assignments, which have granted me some financial freedom, and I've been able to lease my own car, a gorgeous black Tesla.\n\nI'm not the first \"visa wife,\" nor will I be the last. My story is the story of many women who've put oceans between themselves and their family, friends, and work, to move for love. My experience with immigration has taught me that when you move countries, your skills come with you, and if you believe in yourself, they can help you rebuild your professional identity.\n\nI'm proud to have strengthened my identity as a writer during this difficult time. I've written news articles for local outlets, works of fiction and poetry, and non-fiction essays based on my experience as an immigrant. For me, \"home\" is a place where people know my name, and building up professional recognition in the US has given me a greater sense of belonging.\n\nThat said, even though I've picked up temporary work, like contract jobs and freelance gigs, full-time employment remains elusive. I'm still actively looking for jobs, but I've come to believe that the struggle has less to do with my own abilities than imperfect algorithms on job portals, a volatile job market, and a general skew in the Bay Area toward software and technological skills, which makes me feel less in demand as a writer.\n\nI don't write code. I write stories. In \"Alf layla wa Layla,\" an ancient West Asian collection of folk tales, popularly known as \"The Arabian Nights,\" it takes princess Scheherazade a thousand nights to find the path to survival through storytelling.\n\nI fancy myself a modern-day Scheherazade in Sunnyvale, and, having lived as a writer in Silicon Valley for over a thousand days now, I think I'll survive too.\n\nDo you have a story to share about being on an H-4 or another dependent visa?

I saw firsthand how much innovation takes place in the US and how many opportunities exist to work on cutting-edge products, which inspired me to build my career here.\n\nOne of the most valuable parts of the MBA program was its partnerships with Big Tech companies. As part of the curriculum, representatives from Microsoft, Amazon, and Google brought projects to campus.\n\nStudents formed teams, worked on deliverables, and were graded by company representatives. In 2016, I was team lead on a Microsoft project, and we did an excellent job. That gave me a chance to network and to demonstrate my skills to an actual Microsoft product manager.\n\nI applied to about 200 jobs, sending the same generic résumé without referrals. I received only three calls back and passed two interviews, but both offers were subsequently rescinded: one company considered my visa too risky without a STEM extension, and another cited budgetary reasons.\n\nI needed to secure a job within 60-90 days after graduation, or I would be forced to return to India. I ran out of money, asked a friend if I could crash on their couch, and felt a constant sense of anxiety.\n\nDuring that time, I stayed in touch with the Microsoft contact I'd met through my MBA project. When an opening came up, I asked if he would refer me.\n\nHe agreed, and I rewrote my résumé to match the specific role. The hiring manager liked my application, called me in, and I got a shot. That referral and tailoring my résumé made all the difference.\n\nI was hired by Microsoft in July 2017 and started as a product manager. I became a senior product manager in 2021.\n\nFirst, you have to get the interview, and second, you have to pass it. For the first step, referrals are critical. Big Tech companies receive tens of thousands of résumés every month. A referral can push yours to the top of the stack.\n\nTo prepare for interviews, I relied heavily on mock interviews. I reached out to peers who had been in the same boat and asked them to test me. They helped me refine my storytelling, practice answering metrics-driven questions, and pinpoint areas for improvement.\n\nWhen I finally interviewed at Microsoft, the feedback I received was that my stories were authentic and clearly based on real experiences. That authenticity resonated far more than rehearsed answers pulled from the internet.\n\nIn today's tech world, showcasing your skills outside work or school, whether on LinkedIn, GitHub, or through personal projects, demonstrates passion and initiative.\n\nI started posting more consistently on LinkedIn during the pandemic. I shared lessons from my career, thoughts on product management, and observations about the industry. I wasn't trying to \"build a following,\" I just focused on topics that genuinely resonated with me.\n\nOver time, those posts resonated with others, and a community naturally formed around them. The growth happened gradually and organically, simply because people connected with the ideas and conversations.\n\nRecruiters notice when you go beyond the curriculum to learn new tools or contribute to open-source projects. In a fast-changing industry where AI and new technologies emerge every six months, demonstrating your ability to adapt and self-learn is as important as the content of your résumé.\n\nWhile a small percentage of jobs may prefer an MBA, I know successful product managers who came from accounting, English literature, or completely different areas. Microsoft values diverse backgrounds because innovation thrives when teams bring fresh perspectives.\n\nEven with this knowledge, I would still pursue an MBA because it was not just about academics; it was also about gaining practical experience. It provided me with exposure to new perspectives, helped me transition into product management, and connected me with mentors and peers who have shaped my career in meaningful ways.\n\nI don't think an MBA is mandatory for everyone. It depends on your goals and whether you're looking for a career pivot, a network, or structured learning.\n\nVisa restrictions, financial pressure, and cultural adjustments can make the experience stressful. I had moments when I felt defeated, but staying focused and working smart eventually brought everything together.\n\nAfter over eight years at Microsoft, I plan to continue contributing to the technology and innovation ecosystem. I'm exploring the appropriate pathways that align with my career goals, but nothing is finalized at this time. My focus is on the work itself and continuing to grow professionally.\n\nMy advice to anyone following a similar path is straightforward: network strategically, prepare thoroughly, stay authentic, and continually build your skills and presence. Things may look uncertain now, but persistence and the right relationships can open doors you didn't think were possible.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI (AP) — A protest erupted in India’s capital Tuesday in response to the death of a Hindu man who was lynched and burned by an angry mob in neighboring Bangladesh, a new sign of strain in relations between the neighboring countries.\n\nThe protest in New Delhi, mainly led by Hindu nationalist organization Vishva Hindu Parishad, highlights the fragility in the relationship between India and Bangladesh, which often is held up as a rare example of stability in South Asia.\n\nBangladeshi student leader Sharif Osman Hadi died in a hospital in Singapore on Thursday after being shot on Dec. 12 in Dhaka. Police in Bangladesh said they identified suspects and the shooter likely had fled to India.\n\nHadi’s death triggered widespread violence in Dhaka. The offices of two national daily newspapers were torched and Indian diplomatic missions were targeted. A Hindu man also was burned alive, which sparked the protest Tuesday in India.\n\nHundreds of demonstrators gathered Tuesday near the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi, shouting slogans and accusing Bangladeshi groups of wrongly targeting minorities. They carried placards and banners with slogans including “India will not tolerate torture of Hindus in Bangladesh” and “Our silence should not be mistaken as weakness, we are lions.”\n\nAuthorities erected barricades and imposed tight security around the diplomatic enclave that included police and armored vehicles. Security personnel used batons to hold back some protesters who broke through barricades in an apparent attempt to enter the embassy.\n\nOne of the Indian protestors, Rajkumar Jindal, threatened “dire consequences” if authorities in Bangladesh failed to stop violence against Hindus.\n\n“People who are committing atrocities should stop doing that. We are here to awaken the people who are asleep,” Jindal said.\n\nHadi took part in a 2024 political uprising that ended the 15-year rule of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who has been in exile since fleeing Bangladesh on Aug. 5, 2024. He was a fierce critic of India and Hasina and planned to run as an independent candidate in a major constituency in Dhaka in the next national elections in February.\n\nHadi's death sparked a new diplomatic squabble with India and prompted New Delhi this week to summon Bangladesh’s envoy.\n\nBangladesh’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also summoned Pranay Verma, the Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh, to apprise him of the security situation at Bangladesh missions in New Delhi and state capitals Kolkata and Agartala, a leading Bengali-language newspaper reported Tuesday.\n\nTensions between India and Bangladesh increased again with the death on Thursday of Dipu Chandra Das, a 25-year-old Hindu man who was lynched and burned publicly following allegations of blasphemy in Mymensingh district’s Bhaluka subdistrict.\n\nDas's killing contributed to a pattern of fear among the Hindu community in Bangladesh following the ouster of Hasina.\n\nReligious minority groups including Hindus and Christians have accused Bangladesh's interim government headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus of failing to protect the safety of Hindus and others. The Yunus administration has rejected the allegations.\n\nTuesday's protest could complicate cooperation on trade, border management and regional connectivity at a time when the region is already grappling with economic uncertainty and political polarization, said Sreeram Sundar Chaulia, an international affairs expert at New Delhi’s Jindal School of International Affairs.\n\n“Opposing India and alleging Indian conspiracies of interference in Bangladesh are being done in order to harden a blatantly Islamist and non-inclusive path for the country,” Chaulia said.\n\nThe rupture is a setback to India’s broader regional strategy, while for Bangladesh the loss of India’s development assistance and markets could further dampen the country's slowing economy and push it further into dependence on China, Chaulia said.\n\nBangladesh and India have enjoyed a warm relationship since 2009 when Hasina came to power and until her ouster. Hasina was considered a friend by India and both countries thrived on bilateral cooperation. But Hasina’s opponents accused her administration of being subservient to India, a major trade and investment partner.",

    "title": "When Red in the US Is Green in India – The AQI Disparity Problem",
    "description": "AirGradient air quality monitoring.",
    "fullText": "If you look at an air quality map of India, you’ll find that the map looks completely different depending on whether you’re in India or the US. This stems from the major disparities that exist between national air quality indices (AQIs), which use different categorization labels, benchmarks, and colours to denote air quality.\n\nIndia’s National Air Quality Index (NAQI), as seen above on the left, reveals mostly green and yellow clusters, representing “satisfactory” and “moderate” air. For the same exact clusters measured in the same period, using the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) AQI, seen on the right, will show mostly orange and red. These represent “unhealthy for sensitive groups” or generally “unhealthy” air, signalling a significantly higher level of concern.\n\nHere we can see the difference between the categories of these two AQIs – India’s NAQI on the left, and the US AQI on the right. NAQI’s “good” and “satisfactory” standards cover two separate categories, seen here on the AirGradient map legend in two shades of green. For those without a careful eye for detail, this can make a “satisfactory” cluster be mistaken for a “good” one.\n\nThis further highlights the difficulty of comparing cross-country indices; greens, oranges, and reds don’t automatically correspond, and can even be split within one index.\n\nIn its 2021 air quality guidelines, the World Health Organization (WHO) says that a 24-hour average PM2.5 concentration above 15 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) is already beyond its recommended limit. India’s system, in contrast, sets the comparable 24-hour threshold of PM2.5 at 60 µg/m3, which is four times higher.\n\nHowever, India is far from being alone in exceeding this limit. China sets its limit at 75 µg/m3, the European Union at 50 µg/m3, the US at 35 µg/m3, and Canada at 28 µg/m3, just to name a few.\n\nFrom a health perspective, the implications are striking: two people breathing air with the same level of PM2.5 in two different countries could be told very different stories about how safe that air is. This gap silently shapes how millions of people understand the air they breathe, and can influence the activities they undertake in their day-to-day lives. For example, recommendations related to prolonged and strenuous outdoor activities are particularly important, seeing as exercise poses additional health risks due to the increased uptake and deposit of pollutants in the lungs.\n\nAfter all, WHO guidelines remain advisory, and hence, governments have no legal obligation to abide by them. However, they are formulated by expert committees with the aim of informing local policymaking.\n\nFirstly, there’s a technological disparity to note, as countries use different types of reference grade monitors as the ‘official’ norm, which measure air pollution differences. India’s official monitors use beta attenuation monitors (BAMs), which physically weigh particles and require regular maintenance and biyearly calibration, whereas many private platforms use low-maintenance sensor-based devices that rely on laser scattering. BAMs are more accurate and better suited for measuring higher concentrations, which fits with India’s local context. However, without the regular maintenance required, this advantage may be negated, and the accuracy of the data reported may in fact suffer.\n\nAccording to Gufran Beig, founder director of India’s national air quality monitoring system SAFAR, “every country has built its index based on its own adaptability, weather and local environment”. India’s Northern Plain, for example, experiences natural dust storms. These increase both coarse and fine particulate matter concentrations in the ambient air, which cause conditions to exceed the WHO limit. Adopting this standard in these locations would classify air as polluted even without human activity.\n\nThe Indian Environment Ministry raises another point regarding the need to account for “socio-economic status and national circumstances”. While the country is striving to transition towards cleaner alternatives in accordance with the National Action Plan on Climate Change, most of the energy consumed in India is derived from fossil fuels, particularly coal. Meanwhile, the combustion of coal, petrol, diesel, gas, biomass, and waste accounts for 81% of PM2.5 pollution. Therefore, reducing air pollution would logically entail targeting this sector. If India were to strictly adhere to international standards, it would require an overhaul of its energy production systems, transportation, and construction, and would incur significant job losses in the fossil fuel sector. This would impact economic growth and development goals, yielding social and political challenges.\n\nShould there be a standardized international index, or should we allow for cross-country variation?\n\nOn one hand, a stricter index aligned with WHO limits might better reflect health risks and allow for comparable scales, but would expose the severity of a problem that is expensive and politically costly to fix. On the other, a looser index can account for local contexts, and reduce public alarm and short-term political pressure. However, this may come at the cost of long-term passivity.\n\nAt AirGradient, we are grappling with this question ourselves. On our mobile app, which features a map that visualizes real-time air quality data, users can select to display values either as raw concentration values (µg/m³) or using the U.S. EPA Air Quality Index (AQI) scale.\n\nShould we also integrate other national indices such as India’s NAQI? This would allow us to reach a larger audience and adapt to what users are familiar with, but would also mean shaping norms towards an acceptance of indices that may be misinforming their users of the real health risks.\n\nYou can download the AirGradient map and test out the index displays here: App Store / Play Store\n\nCentral Pollution Control Board.

The trio moved on to Hyderabad later that day, then to Mumbai on Sunday before finishing in New Delhi on Monday.\n\nIndia was the only country the tour visited.\n\nThere was a variety of ticket options to suit budgets.\n\nFor access to the stadium only, face value tickets cost 3,500 rupees (£29) for Kolkata and Hyderabad. For New Dehli, the price was 4,200 rupees (£35).\n\nHowever, this is about half the average weekly wage in India. But with tickets sold out, fans were paying much more for the chance to see Messi.\n\nReports in Indian media said some locals had paid up to 12,000 rupees (£99) to get in.\n\nAmong the other ticket types was a VVIP option which included a meet-and-greet with Messi, including a photograph. Only 100 were available at a price of one million rupees (£8,200).\n\nMessi landed in Kolkata at 01:30 local time. Thousands lined the roads and congregated outside his hotel to catch a glimpse of him.\n\nThe day began with the meet-and-greet ticket holders first up from 09:00 to 10:30.\n\nThen the day took a strange twist.\n\nA 70ft statue of Messi lifting the World Cup was unveiled by the former Barcelona icon.\n\nBut he was not present - it was a virtual unveiling. He was on a video screen and pressed a button on a remote control. At this point a blue sheet dropped to reveal the huge iron structure.\n\nMessi met with Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan before heading to Salt Lake Stadium for 11:30.\n\nThe plan was for him to be at the ground for an hour. He was gone after only 20 minutes and violence erupted because ticket holders did not get to see Messi among the throng of security, politicians and celebrities.\n\n\"Only leaders and actors were surrounding Messi. Why did they call us then? We have got a ticket for 12,000 rupees, but we were not even able to see his face,\" a fan at the stadium told Indian news agency ANI.\n\nOne angry supporter told the Press Trust of India news agency that people had paid the equivalent of a month's salary to see the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner.\n\n\"I paid 5,000 rupees for the ticket and came with my son to watch Messi, not politicians,\" they said.\n\n\"The police and military personnel were taking selfies, and the management is to blame.\"\n\nThere was supposed to be a friendly match, more of kickabout, with some local players but this did not happen.\n\nMessi was whisked off to Hyderabad.\n\nMessi walked out at the stadium waving to fans, but after his appearance was abruptly ended some frustrated supporters stormed the pitch and vandalised banners and tents, while others hurled plastic chairs and water bottles.\n\nWest Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said she was \"deeply disturbed and shocked\" by the events.\n\nAnnouncing an enquiry, Banerjee apologised to Messi and \"sports lovers\" for the scenes at the stadium.\n\n\"The [enquiry] committee will conduct a detailed enquiry into the incident, fix responsibility, and recommend measures to prevent such occurrences in the future,\" she added on X.\n\nA spokesperson for Messi said he fulfilled the time commitment that had been agreed in advance. In terms of the organisation of the event itself, he referred the BBC to the apology issued by Banerjee on social media.\n\nKolkata's Telegraph newspaper said in an editorial piece that \"poor management of a hyped-up event, lack of co-ordination\" and security lapses turned the stadium into a \"battlefield\".\n\nSatadru Dutta, the event organiser, was arrested and a city court remanded him in police custody for 14 days.\n\nThe rest of the tour appears to have gone without a hitch, with fans getting to see Messi, Suarez and De Paul.\n\nThe Times of India reported how the event in Hyderabad went smoothly, with the stands full and Messi staying on the pitch for a full hour.\n\nAfter leaving Hyderabad, on Sunday Messi met with India cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar in Mumbai.\n\nFog delayed their arrival into Dehli on Monday, where thousands of fans gathered inside New Delhi's Arun Jaitley Stadium and were treated to a half-hour appearance when the trio kicked balls into the stands, passed balls with a group of children and signed autographs.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

On Saturday angry fans vandalised a Kolkata stadium because they didn't get to see him during his appearance there.\n\nMessi had a packed schedule in India, attending a string of promotional events in Kolkata, Hyderabad and Mumbai since arriving in the early hours of Saturday.\n\nBefore heading to Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium later that day, he virtually unveiled a 70ft (21m) statue of himself, assembled over 27 days by a 45-strong crew in the eastern city.\n\nThe tour, however, got off to a disastrous start after angry fans ripped up seats and threw items towards the pitch at the stadium.\n\nFootball is hugely popular in West Bengal state - of which Kolkata is the capital - and thousands of adoring supporters had paid up to 12,000 rupees (£100; $133) to attend the event.\n\nHowever, most of them didn't even get to see him as he was surrounded by officials and celebrities on his brief walk around the stadium and then quickly whisked away as the situation turned hostile.\n\nKolkata's The Telegraph newspaper said in an editorial that \"poor management of a hyped-up event, lack of co-ordination\" and security lapses turned the stadium into a \"battlefield\", as fans - denied even a glimpse of Messi - \"vented their anger by indulging in violence\".\n\nThe ruckus, which made international headlines, cast a shadow over Messi's first visit to India since 2011 for what has been called a 'GOAT [greatest of all time] tour'.\n\nThe event organiser in Kolkata has been arrested, police said, and a city court has remanded Satadru Dutta to 14 days in police custody.\n\nMessi's visits to Hyderabad and Mumbai passed off smoothly, with fans sharing their delight at seeing the global icon online and in media interviews.\n\nMessi also met several politicians and celebrities - Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan in Kolkata (at his hotel before the stadium fiasco), opposition leader Rahul Gandhi in Hyderabad, and cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar in Mumbai.\n\nIn between these interactions, Messi could be seen waving to large fan gatherings in stadiums and dribbling the ball with groups of children.\n\nThere were reports earlier that Messi would meet Narendra Modi in Delhi, but the Indian prime minister left the country on Monday morning on a scheduled visit to Jordan, Ethiopia and Oman.\n\nMessi's popularity stems not just from his long international career and wide TV coverage of European football - he's record scorer for Barcelona, the team he used to play for - but also the emotional connection that millions of Indians have with what is often called the beautiful game.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",
