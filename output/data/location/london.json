    "description": "Exclusive: Rail firm has offered £150 for a London hotel – but says contact centre will be pragmatic on claims",
    "fullText": "An estimated 25,000 Eurostar passengers had their travel plans torn up due to the closure of the Channel Tunnel for many hours on 30 December.\n\nThirty trains connecting London St Pancras International with Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam have been cancelled.\n\nServices have now resumed, but passengers have been told that unless they have a confirmed for one of the trains that are running, they should leave the station.\n\nEven though easyJet put on extra capacity between London and Paris, air fares have soared due to the mass cancellations. The cheapest British Airways flight on New Year’s Eve is £625.\n\nThousand of people are out of position. Unfortunately for those travellers, care and compensation rules for international rail travellers are far less comprehensive and generous than for airline passengers.\n\nThese are the key questions and answers about rail passengers’ rights.\n\n“Following the suspension services of services due to overhead power supply issues in the Channel Tunnel and a failed LeShuttle train, Eurostar services to and from London will resume this evening at around 6pm following the partial reopening of the Channel Tunnel.\n\n“As the overhead power supply issues in the Channel Tunnel still remain, only one line is available to run trains on. This means there will continue to be delays and longer journey times than usual this evening.\n\n“Therefore we continue to advise our customers to rebook their journey for another day if possible, with free exchanges available.\n\n“We also advise customers not to come to our stations if their trains have been already been cancelled.\n\n“Although outside of our control, we apologise for the disruption today and will continue to keep customers updated with the latest information and support them with rescheduling their bookings.”\n\nYou can rebook, but only “in the same travel class, subject to availability”. Most unfortunately, there do not appear to be any seats on any trains for the rest of the year.\n\nIf you decide to cancel, Eurostar is offering an “e-voucher for the unused ticket, valid for 12 months”, but it would be daft to take this rather than a full cash refund.\n\nNo. In aviation, when an airline cancels a flight it must cover the cost of getting you to your destination as soon as possible (including, if nothing else is available, in Eurostar Premier class).\n\nBut that is not the case for international rail passengers. Even though air fares surged way beyond normal levels, all you can claim back from Eurostar is the original price of your ticket.\n\nTravel insurance is the best route for a claim for extra costs.\n\nThe rail firm says: “Eurostar will cover reasonable expenses, including hotel accommodation up to £150/€170 per room, per night.” The nearest Premier Inn is currently charging £192. Eurostar says the contact centre “will be pragmatic when compensating”. Taxi costs up to £50/€60 per journey are also covered, as well as food and drink expenses up to £35 / €40 per person, per day.\n\nThere is no possibility of an airline-style payout of hundreds of pounds. The best you can hope for is compensation if you travel with Eurostar on a heavily delayed service. The company offers a choice between a partial refund of the cost of your ticket, or a voucher for future travel within a year – typically worth 20 to 50 per cent more than the cash refund.\n\nDelays of under an hour do not qualify for compensation. These are the refund rates according to the length of delay:\n\n60-119 minutes: 25 per cent of journey cost in cash, or 30 per cent as a voucher\n\n120 minutes and above: 50 per cent of journey cost in cash, or 60 per cent as a voucher (increasing to 75 per cent for a delay of three hours or more)\n\nNo. You are unable to claim for costs triggered by the train cancellation, such as a hotel in Paris, Brussels or Amsterdam that you cannot reach. Travel insurance may cover such a loss.",

    "description": "Gregor Konzett quit his dream job at Google and gave up his US visa to be part of a startup accelerator program. Here's how he took a calculated risk.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Gregor Konzett, a 27-year-old former Google employee based in London. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I got relocated to work out of Google's Mountain View headquarters in 2024, it was a dream come true.\n\nI was raised in a small village in Austria, but I always dreamed of living in Silicon Valley. As a child who was excited about tech, I wanted to be where innovation happened.\n\nMy team was based in California, but I was working from London. Not even a year into my job, I was asking if I could be transferred.\n\nTwo years after getting hired as a software engineer, Google transferred me to Silicon Valley. Then, a year after that, I quit. I packed up my bags and moved back to London in just two weeks to participate in a startup accelerator program. It was worth the risk, even in this difficult job market.\n\nI joined Google in 2022 as a software engineer on the Google Pixel audio team. I enjoyed my job, but being in London, the physical distance turned minor questions into major delays. If I hit a blocker with a specific subsystem, I'd send a message and wait 24 hours for a reply due to time zone differences, or spend many late nights in chats with colleagues to unblock myself.\n\nAfter I was finally relocated to the Mountain View headquarters, living in the Bay Area was almost exactly as I had always imagined it from movies and TV. California is the most beautiful place I've ever been to, and being able to call it my home was incredible.\n\nIt was great to be part of an environment filled with so many other engineers. I remember going surfing with some people and just having the most Silicon Valley conversation ever about coding and deep tech. The only thing I didn't expect was that it's not this crazy, futuristic place. In reality, the infrastructure was just OK, and the internet speed wasn't even very reliable.\n\nThe work life at the Google headquarters was really nice. On average, it was a typical 9-to-5, and my team had a really great dynamic.\n\nFor the first few months, I was learning a lot, and everything ramped up quickly. My team gave me a lot of responsibility and trusted me to handle huge pieces of the system, which is amazing and rare for a company of its size.\n\nBeing in the office, I got to sit on the same floor as the teams building the specific subsystems I was coding for, and sit in meetings where product decisions were actually made. I could walk 10 feet, point at a whiteboard, and solve complex architectural issues in minutes. I learned \n\nHowever, after about a year, I felt like I had reached a natural ceiling in my work, and I wasn't learning much anymore. I wasn't super happy in my job, and my visa limited me from working on my own projects outside of Google, which was my real dream.\n\nOne of my closest friends got into a startup accelerator program in London and encouraged me to apply, with the plan of using it as an opportunity to cofound our own startup. When I got accepted with a start date only a month away, I knew I'd have to make a quick decision. I loved California, and leaving Google would mean leaving the country.\n\nThe job market has been terrible, and I questioned whether this was the right time to quit my job and potentially face unemployment. However, I felt confident in my technical background and having Google on my résumé, so I believed I could find another job.\n\nThe hardest part about deciding to quit was that it was objectively a really good job, and leaving meant giving up my path to a green card in the US. I was stuck in a dilemma: do I stay in a role I've outgrown for four, or potentially even more years, just to secure permanent residency, or do I quit to chase higher job satisfaction?\n\nI realized that staying for the sake of immigration meant stalling my career development.\n\nI figured now was the time to take a risk. I'm young and have a financial runway from my Google salary, and I don't have a mortgage to pay or a family to care for. So, I put in my two weeks at Google.\n\nIt's been a few months since I joined the program, and my friend and I are working on our startup, Vestry.ai, which fixes the observability gap for complex hardware. Our plan is to build while we're in the accelerator, get funding, and move back to California to live the startup life.\n\nCalifornia is ultimately the place to be for anything in the startup world. We want to be a part of the AI revolution, and that's just where you've got to be.\n\nI've been so busy with the program I haven't really had any time to think about whether I made the right choice, but I'm convinced I'm where I need to be.\n\nDo you have a story to share about quitting Big Tech? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Cybersecurity experts reveal what they do for high-profile clients targeted by hackers such as Scattered Spider\n\nThey call it “stopping the bleeding”: the vital window to prevent an entire database from being ransacked by criminals or a production line grinding to a halt.\n\nWhen a call comes into the cybersecurity firm S-RM, headquartered on Whitechapel High Street in east London, a hacked business or institution may have just minutes to protect themselves.\n\nS-RM, which helped a high-profile retail client recover from a Scattered Spider cyber-attack has become a quiet, often word-of-mouth, success.\n\nMany of the company’s senior workers are multilingual and have a minimal online footprint, which reveals scant but impressive CVs suggestive of corporate or government intelligence-based careers.\n\nS-RM now claims the UK’s largest cyber-incident response team. Its first-responder service is comprised of about 150 experts worldwide. It has clients who keep it on retainer, victims referred by insurers, and “walk-ins”: people who suddenly realise their business is under attack and call the first few results on their search engines.\n\nIn the case of the Scattered Spider victim, which the Guardian understands was not Marks & Spencer or the Co-op – two retailers that were attacked in 2025 – a 30-minute Teams call with a retailer became “a 24-hour call with a rotating cast of experts”, says Ted Cowell, the director of S-RM’s cyber business arm.\n\n“On average we’re getting back to clients within six minutes. Which is critical because often the first hours of a cyber incident can be the biggest chance window to determine the outcome of a case and its impact,” he says. “What can start as a network intrusion can then metastasise into a full-blown malware or ransomware scenario.”\n\nCowell, a Cambridge-educated Russian speaker, says that getting a handle on the attack during a “reconnaissance” period can result in a radically different outcome, compared with a slow response. Criminals often need time after their first penetration of a businesses’ systems to work out what is of most value. This short spell of time can therefore allow experts to prevent the most operationally painful of attacks. “Exfiltration” – the theft of critical data – and encryption, whereby businesses can be locked out of their own systems, can be the most damaging.\n\n“Sometimes we can stop it from going boom,” Cowell says. Teams focus on “stopping the bleeding” by limiting or cutting the attacker’s access to systems. This is what S-RM’s team was able to do with the Scattered Spider victim: stopping the detonation of malware across systems.\n\nBusiness is good as the cybercrime industry grows, but that comes with ethical challenges. S-RM and its industry peers have faced criticism for helping to facilitate the payment of ransoms to criminals who hijack businesses for money.\n\n“Extortion support” is an important part of S-RM’s work. This means its specialists are in the room when ransoms are negotiated, sometimes doing the negotiation itself on behalf of a client. Cowell appears keen to avoid criticisms of feeding organised crime by helping businesses to pay ransoms, or by acting for insurers that sell policies covering ransom payments.\n\n“We’re instructed by the policyholder, by the insured,” he says.\n\n“Our ambition is to guide ‘no payment’ decisions wherever and whenever possible,” he continues, adding that businesses are increasingly taking that approach and not paying ransoms.\n\n“Our role is to facilitate strategic thinking,” he says. “Give clients some structure to order their thoughts. They’ve probably not been in a situation like this before.\n\n“The businesses’ decision as to what they do is their own. We just offer the template of a crisis, how things play out based on our experience.\n\n“Why should we pay these criminals?” is a challenge Cowell says his team puts to top staff at affected businesses. “One of the things that we often educate boards on is that ransomware is an organised criminal enterprise.”\n\nThese nefarious groups have, he explains, “brands to uphold”. Established ransomware groups, typically speaking, will honour a settlement. S-RM also has an increasingly detailed picture of how these groups have behaved in previous negotiations.\n\nThe more established the group, the more likely they are to honour whatever settlement is agreed either by deleting stolen data or providing keys to decrypt critical files. S-RM offers a rundown of who’s who in terms of reliability, negotiating patterns, behaviours, even extending to sanctions concerns.\n\nThe latter rarely applies, however. Trying to impose sanctions on state-linked groups is a game of “whack-a-mole”, Cowell says. If so-called “threat actors” do appear on sanctions lists they tend to disband and reform in a new guise. The risk of putting money, albeit indirectly, into state-enemy hands is therefore another consideration for firms facing a cyber-attack.\n\nStill, businesses do sometimes decide to pay up. It can be rational for their company’s circumstances, and ultimately “it’s always their decision”, Cowell says.\n\nAs the corporate moral code of paying ransoms matures, and decisions not to fund organised crime become more common, restoration and recovery services have become a bigger part of the cybersecurity response market. Increasingly it is a priority to just get systems back up and running as soon as possible with the forensic analysis of how someone got into a system becoming secondary.\n\nIn recent years, the UK government’s cyber-intelligence role has also shifted significantly. The National Cyber Security Centre “over the last four or five years has hugely transformed”, Cowell says. The NCSC has caught up with its Nordic equivalents and now proactively reaches out to victims, telling them they may be targeted based on intelligence.\n\n“It was more of an information taker,” asking the likes of S-RM for information, which they would willingly provide with client consent, Cowell says.\n\n“[Now] they are playing a more robust role, getting on the front foot and getting people together to facilitate information sharing. We saw the impact of that with the Scattered Spider attacks.,” he adds.",

    "description": "After-work pints have long been a sacred tradition of British workers. Has COVID and the world of hybrid work changed that?",
    "fullText": "It's not yet 5 pm on a Thursday in late November, and the skies have fully darkened over the City of London's Leadenhall Market. It's the coldest day in recent memory, a harbinger of the looming winter, but no matter.\n\nHere in London, it's time for a pint.\n\nAfter-work pints have been a sacred tradition of British workers for centuries. For years, Leadenhall Market has been the go-to spot for bankers, insurance brokers, and financial advisors who work in the City, the financial center of London.\n\nBut reports of waning nightlife due to a post-pandemic hangover and Gen Z's growing disinterest in drinking have worried pub-goers and publicans alike.\n\nOver a quarter - 26% - of people in the UK, 16 to 24-year-olds reported themselves as not having an alcoholic drink in a year, according to the most recent Health Survey for England conducted by the National Health Service in 2022. That's the highest percentage of any age group.\n\nThis December, research group IWSR said that Brits are drinking less than ever before, with the average person in the UK having just over 10 drinks a week, down almost 30% from previous highs.\n\nGiven these fears, the Mayor of London has even assembled a task force to help \"protect, retain and grow nightlife\" in the nation's capital.\n\nWrapped up in my warmest scarf and gloves, I paid a visit to this mecca of City nightlife to find out firsthand whether these reports of dampened spirits were true.\n\nNon-locals might not expect a sea of finance bros in this historic covered market, fitting of the Harry Potter universe — probably because it is a scene from that universe. In 2001, Leadenhall Market was used as the exterior of the Leaky Cauldron in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\n\nThe pathways are lined with cobblestones, and the red columns and arched ceilings have been decorated with ornaments. In the center of the market, a Christmas tree towered over tourists with selfie sticks.\n\nBut if you work in the City — the financial center of London — you know that the real attraction of Leadenhall Market is Thursday evening pints.\n\nWhen I arrived just before the clock struck happy hour, the market's alleys were already lively. Men and women dressed almost exclusively in black and brown coats were packed into the barriers outside the pubs, despite the bitter cold.\n\n\"You get used to it,\" Callum, a 26-year-old working as a recruiter in financial services, said with a shrug. \"A beer jacket is a great thing to have.\"\n\nAdmittedly, these crowds aren't quite what I was expecting.\n\nThe data indicate that London hasn't quite recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic, with the city losing a fifth of its late-night venues since 2020, according to a report published in August from the Nighttime Industries Association.\n\nNot everyone's mourning this loss. Some embrace it.\n\nOutside The Swan, I chat with a group of young men who are out for a birthday celebration.\n\n\"He's 26,\" said Joy, who works in insurance, pointing to his friend. \"Pushing 30.\"\n\nJoy, solidly a member of Gen Z, said he doesn't hang around Leadenhall Market too much.\n\n\"Previous generations, it would just be this, just drinking,\" he says of after-work corporate culture. \"But we do a lot more stuff as well, like sports. We play football or padel.\"\n\nDrinking is expensive, for one, and the inflation rate for alcohol leapt after the pandemic. The cost of living is a factor, as is the desire to be healthy and develop meaningful friendships.\n\n\"It's about trying to find a way to connect to others,\" added Michael, also a 24-year-old insurance worker. \"And it helps you drink less than previous generations.\"\n\nJoy and Michael aren't cutting out alcohol entirely. They're out tonight for a special celebration, and Michael mentions that after volleyball practice, he and his fellow players go out for a pint or two. But it's a more moderate approach than their older colleagues, they agreed.\n\nCaroline, a bartender who has worked at Leadenhall Market for 13 years, says that things didn't take too long to return to normal.\n\n\"The City of London is sort of different from other sites. People spend money in this area,\" Caroline said.\n\nStill, things look a little different. Not as many Gen Z-ers buy rounds, Caroline told me, although she's noticed the younger generations are taking more shots than they once did.\n\nBut the biggest difference is the Thursday-ification of after-work drinking culture.\n\nFriday used to be the big night out, but things have changed largely due to the hybrid working culture now present in much of the corporate world.\n\n\"On Friday, most people aren't working in the City,\" Alex, who works in software, told me outside a traditional pub called New Moon. \"There are less people around on Fridays, but the pubs are always busy on a Thursday night.\"\n\nIt's a trend that Caroline has noticed, along with bartender Paolo, who's worked in Leadenhall Market for the past seven years.\n\n\"It's more of a Tuesday to Thursday culture,\" Paolo said, in comparison to the glory days of five nights a week of City workers out for a drink.\n\nIf Leadenhall Market is any bellwether of London as a whole, it would be premature to say nightlife is marching toward its own death. But, thanks in part to Gen Z and changing work habits overall, it does seem to be transforming.\n\nThe sacred London after-work pint is safe, for now.",

The metal that’s crucial for renewable energy and power grids surged as much as 6.6% to $12,960 a ton on the London Metal Exchange as trading resumed following a two-day UK public holiday. Gains have reached more than 15% in December as investors bet that a rush to get metal to the US ahead of possible import tariffs will force buyers elsewhere to pay more.",

    "fullText": "Merlin has been trained to identify the songs of more than 1,300 bird species around the world\n\nWhen Natasha Walter first became curious about the birds around her, she recorded their songs on her phone and arduously tried to match each song with online recordings. After a friend recommended Merlin Bird ID, a free app, she tried it in her London garden and was delighted to discover the birds she assumed were female blackbirds – “this is how bad a birder I was” – were actually song thrushes and mistle thrushes.\n\n“I’m obsessed with Merlin – it’s wonderful and it’s been a joy to me,” says Walter, a writer and human rights activist. “This is what AI and machine-learning have been invented for. It’s the one good thing!”\n\nMerlin is having a moment. The app, developed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in New York, which listens for birdsong and identifies the species singing, has been downloaded 33m times, in 240 countries and territories around the world. Britain has the second highest total number of users – more than 1.5 million in 2024, an 88% increase from 2023. Every month, there has been a 30% increase in new users of the app, whose sound identification function was launched in 2021.\n\nMerlin has been trained to identify the songs of more than 1,300 species around the world, with more birds added twice a year. Different songs make distinct patterns on spectrograms and Merlin is trained to recognise these different shapes and attribute them to a species.\n\nFor latecomers to birding, or those lacking a knowledgeable friend, the app has become their teacher. “My fear at first was I wouldn’t actually learn because I’m outsourcing my understanding of birds to this app,” says Walter. “But that hasn’t come to pass. It’s helped me continue my journey of learning.” Nowadays, she guesses, and uses Merlin to confirm her hunches. “It’s wonderful if you’re coming to bird-watching late and don’t really have a mentor,” she says.\n\nAngela Townsend from Bedfordshire began using Merlin after going on a nightingale walk one spring and being overwhelmed by the range of bird-voices in the evening chorus. She has found it has steadily built up her bird knowledge. “Warblers were just little brown jobbies but I can now recognise Cetti’s warblers and willow warblers when I’m out without having to put the app on,” she says.\n\nMary Novakovich, author of My Family and Other Enemies, is another recent adopter. She has found it particularly useful when travelling across Croatia, where her parents are from. “I love putting a name to a face and a name to the sound,” she says. “It really brings you closer to the natural world, rather than it being disconnected from your life. It’s part of what makes life a joy.”\n\nMerlin is not flawless, however. The first time Kasper Wall, 12, tried it in his Norfolk garden, it detected a northern cardinal and a brown-headed cowbird – North American species not found in Britain.\n\n“I think it was figuring out where we live,” says Wall, who enjoys using it even though he is now an extremely knowledgeable birder. “A couple of weeks ago we were looking at a large group of goldcrest and it came up with a firecrest. I thought, ‘Oh, there must be a firecrest in here too’ and 30 seconds later we saw one, which was the first I’d ever seen. I like it and it’s very good but I wouldn’t say that it’s better than the best people at identifying bird-calls like [the naturalist] Nick Acheson. It can definitely be fooled.”\n\nWall enjoys fooling Merlin with his uncanny impressions of a curlew, barn owl and greenshank.\n\nAcheson doesn’t use Merlin. He welcomes it, but points out it can replace learning. “Anything that gets people out, thinking about and reacting to nature is a great thing,” he says. “But there’s certainly a risk that people don’t learn and just abdicate responsibility for learning to Merlin.”\n\nHe has noticed a glitch where Merlin interprets a certain type of chaffinch call as a redstart, leading to people being absolutely adamant that there is a rare bird in their garden. “There’s no substitute for a real person explaining to you how a birdsong feels and encouraging someone to engage with it emotionally,” he says.\n\nJohn Williamson, who works as a guide for Norfolk Wildlife Trust, has found Merlin repeatedly identifying high-pitched calls as a spotted flycatcher, a bird that is very unlikely to be found in the middle of Hickling Broad nature reserve’s large reedbeds. “Merlin can’t do habitat,” he says.\n\nMerlin has also excited visitors by identifying a golden oriole, a very occasional rare migrant, in Hickling woods, but no one has actually seen the species. Williamson is convinced it is misinterpreting a fairly unusual “catcall” of a female jay, a common woodland bird.\n\nThat said, Williamson finds it a “good tool” and welcomes how it is encouraging new people to enjoy birdsong, and particularly its mental health benefits. He knows one person who suffers from acute anxiety but Merlin has got him out into the world again and into nature, providing a focus for calming trips outdoors. “I find it impressive that an app can empower people to go out into nature,” he says.\n\nResearch has found that birdsong is particularly beneficial to mental health, and has a lasting positive impact on wellbeing. For millions around the globe, that’s exactly what Merlin is doing.\n\n“It reminds you that there are birds knitted into your daily life,” says Walter. “It’s not about, ‘now I’m going to do a bit of birdwatching’, you may simply be walking through the park and you hear something and it gives you a sense that these birds are singing away all the time, even in London.”",

    "fullText": "DENVER (AP) — A Colorado woman suspected of killing two of her young children during a custody dispute with her ex-husband two years ago has been returned from Britain to the United States to face charges, authorities said Tuesday.\n\nColorado Springs-based District Attorney Michael Allen announced the extradition of Kimberlee Singler, 37, on charges including two counts of first-degree murder ahead of her first court appearance in the coming days.\n\nSingler was arrested in December 2023 in London just over a week after her 9-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son were found dead in their home in Colorado Springs. Her 11-year-old daughter was injured but survived. The girl eventually told an investigator that her mother said God made her do it, according to court documents in the United Kingdom.\n\nSingler, who had superficial knife wounds, told police that a man who entered the apartment was responsible. She was initially considered a victim.\n\nThe surviving daughter backed up Singler’s claim at first, but police sought to arrest Singler on Dec. 26, 2023, after they said the girl changed her story. By then Singler was gone. She was found four days later in London’s upscale Chelsea neighborhood and arrested. It is not known why she ended up there.\n\n“Today really is a significant milestone in this criminal investigation,” Colorado Springs Police Chief Adrian Vasquez said at a news conference. “Singler is accused of committing an unthinkable act. ... I know these acts have deeply impacted this community, and our hearts remain with the victims.\"\n\nAllen said Singler will be held without bond at least until a preliminary hearing on whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed toward trial. That hearing typically is scheduled within 30 days of an initial court appearance, with some exceptions, he said.\n\nAllen and other officials declined to discuss details of the prosecution's case beyond procedural steps.\n\nThe FBI and Colorado Springs police traveled to London to take custody of Singler, who fought extradition and denied attacking her children.\n\nHer London defense attorney, Edward Fitzgerald, argued that she should not be extradited because if convicted of first-degree murder in Colorado, she would face a mandatory sentence of life without parole — a sentence that violates European human rights law.\n\nFitzgerald represented WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in his long fight against extradition to face espionage charges in the U.S.\n\nSingler did not yet have a U.S.-based attorney listed as representing her in court documents, according to the court clerk’s office.\n\nA judge rejected Singler's challenge in January 2025, and her bid for an appeal was denied in November.\n\nSingler also faces one count of attempted murder, three counts of child abuse and one count of assault.\n\nAccording to U.K. court documents, the children's bodies were found by police shortly after midnight on Dec. 19, 2023. Police said they found no footprints in the snow leading to a patio where Singler said an intruder entered through an unlocked door and attacked her, causing her to lose consciousness.\n\nShe told police that her ex-husband “had previously dreamt about killing his family, that the children’s father was always trying to ‘frame her’ and ‘get her arrested’ and to have the kids taken away from her,” Judge John Zani said in a January ruling against Singler in Westminster Magistrates' Court.\n\nPolice said GPS records showed that her ex-husband was driving a truck about 80 miles (130 kilometers) away at the time of the killings.\n\nThe family had been staying with Singler’s mother during the custody battle, but the mother was away at the time, according to court documents in the U.K.\n\nThe day before the bodies were found, a judge in Colorado ordered Singler to comply with a previous order to allow the father to take custody of them for the holidays, according to state court records. She was told to either give the children to her ex-husband on her own or bring them to a court hearing Dec. 20, 2023, to exchange custody there.\n\nOn the day of the hearing, Singler asked the judge to delay it, saying in a motion that she and her children had been attacked and two of them were murdered. She asked for time to grieve and “gain my bearings after this incident.”",

He led Paris St-Germain to the Champions League semi-finals in 2024 before winning WSL 2 with London City.\n\nBut London City are not afraid of making mistakes. They genuinely believe this ruthless decision will pay dividends in the future and hope to be judged on that.\n\nWhile Precheur's impact was important during the club's infancy, there is a feeling London City are moving towards a Spanish football identity.\n\nBarcelona have dominated club football in Europe, reaching the Champions League final in six of the past seven seasons and winning the title three times.\n\nSpain's national team are currently the world champions and European runners-up.\n\nSo when former Barcelona head coach Jonatan Giraldez joined Kang's Washington Spirit in 2024, before switching to Lyon this year, it was not a huge surprise.\n\nSpanish football has a clear identity and a way of playing - heavy possession-based football with high technical skill. It is believed London City want to achieve that, as well as the traditional physicality of the English game.\n\nThe club had a shortlist of coaches they looked at to replace Precheur and did not rule out some from the men's game but appear to have ultimately chosen Maestre, who showed his potential with Spanish clubs CD Tenerife and Real Sociedad.\n\nThe main criteria for London City's next appointment is believed to have been centred around the playing style, the coach's ability to collaborate with a wider team of expertise and a track record of developing players and talented youth.\n\nWhen the appointment is confirmed, Maestre would be expected to play a role in the club's January recruitment.\n\nLondon City spent big in the summer, bringing in star names such as France international Grace Geyoro and former Lyon midfielder Danielle van de Donk.\n\nThe transfer policy this time around is believed to be about targeting future stars who can adapt to London City's new-look training programme and coaching style.\n\nThey want to be competing for silverware in the near future, and to battle the Champions League's elite, so they are shopping for future European champions.\n\nMaestre's imminent arrival is likely to be paired with the appointments of other staff members, including analysts and medical experts.\n\nWhat is clear is that London City are not here to make friends, they are here to rock the boat and are planning big things for the future.\n\nWhether it pays off or not, we will have to wait and see.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "description": "Excavations revealed everything from a 14th-century Black Death group burial to three skeletons from the late 12th or early 13th centuries buried in coffins.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nThe first excavation at the famed Tower of London in a generation uncovered more than 20 skeletal remains.\n\nExcavations revealed everything from a 14th-century Black Death group burial to three skeletons from the late 12th or early 13th centuries buried in coffins.\n\nThe on-site chapel is serving as a tell-all of London’s medieval history.\n\nA rare dig into the soil of the famed Tower of London—the first excavation at the site in a generation—yielded two skeletons from around 1500. As archaeologists dug deeper into the ground, they found roughly 20 more burials, including one group grave likely tied to the 1348 “Black Death” plague.\n\n“Undertaking these two excavations has provided us with a generational opportunity to enhance our understanding of the evolution off the Chapel of Saint Peter ad Vincula, and the buildings which stood before it,” Alfred Hawkins, curator of historic buildings at Historic Royal Palaces, the organization that oversees the Tower, said in a statement.\n\nThe dig began as a trial excavation in 2019 to prepare the on-site Chapel Royal of St Peter ad Vincula for a new elevator. The archaeologists helming the excavation discovered the remains of two skeletons. Subsequent excavations outside the chapel as deep as 10 feet below the surface revealed everything from a 14th-century Black Death group burial to three skeletons from the late 12th or early 13th centuries buried in coffins—an unusually expensive burial for that time.\n\nJane Sidell, principal inspector of ancient monuments at Historic England, said the team is already gaining insight into the residents of the Tower in a way they never have before. “This is just the tip of the iceberg,” she said in a statement. “There is so much more to learn through further analysis about the people as well as the buildings of one of England’s most evocative historic monuments.”\n\nThe Tower of London was built alongside the River Thames in the 1070s as a royal palace. It also served as a prison for high-status individuals (including King Henry VI), and housed the country’s Royal Mint. But it has seemingly almost always had a chapel on its grounds.\n\nThe current parish church for the residents of the Tower of London was built in 1520, after a 1512 fire devoured the one King Edward I built in 1287. A compacted layer of stone found in the recent excavation could be a 1240 project at the site led by Henry III, showing there was a chapel before 1287.\n\nAnd since the current chapel sits atop the same land as the Tower’s previous chapel foundations, burials aplenty are to be expected. Of the recent finds, the older burials could have even been buried inside one of the long-destroyed chapels. “Typically, if you’re buried closer to the church, you’re more important, and if you’re buried inside the church, you’re much, much more important, and if you’re buried under the altar, you are the most important person,” Hawkins said, according to National Geographic.\n\nKnown burials at the site include three queens and two Catholic saints, but finding out more about the unknown skeletons could help piece together the medieval story of the site.\n\n“The new excavations provide the opportunity to transform our understanding of the Tower’s community,” Katie Faillace from Cardiff University’s School of History, Archaeology, and Religion, said in a statement. “Our work uses a biomolecular technique known as isotope analysis, which tells us about health, diet, and mobility in the past, all from a tiny fragment of a tooth. This cutting-edge method was unparalleled potential for reconstructing the experiences of the people who lived and died at the Tower, allowing us to build a rich picture of individuals’ lives.”\n\nThe analysis on the first two skeletons starts developing that picture. Richard Madgwick, archaeological scientist at Cardiff University and part of the team, told National Geographic that one individual was likely a middle-aged female who died between 1480 and 1550. Clues indicate she likely lived as far away as Wales at one point, and had a diet featuring sugar—an expensive ingredient at the time.\n\nThe second skeleton belonged to a younger man who died around the same time. Details of his remains show a high-stress life that likely played out just north of London. His diet was much less exotic.\n\n“I’m looking forward to starting analysis of some of the other amazing finds we have uncovered along the way,” Hawkins said. “This is a very, very rare opportunity to get this information.”\n\nAlong with the remains, the team found a rare burial shroud from the late 12th or early 13th century (fabric doesn’t usually last through the ages), jewelry, shards of stained glass, and rare grave goods in the form of funerary incense pots dated to between 1150 and 1250 (with charcoal still inside them).\n\n“At the moment we’ve got these lovely two biographies,” Madgwick said. “It hints at the dynamic movement of people and the dynamic life trajectories of the people who were buried in the Tower, but it’s going to be really exciting to see whether we’ve picked two anomalies, or whether we see the broader range of lifeways that we see of those buried here.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "London Business School professor Ekaterina Abramova said that rapid AI disruption could outpace institutions and destabilize societies.",
    "fullText": "A historic labor shock may be about to hit the job market.\n\nThat's according to London Business School professor Ekaterina Abramova.\n\nShe said AI is advancing so quickly that it could trigger mass layoffs long before new jobs emerge to replace them — a mismatch that has historically fueled social unrest.\n\nAbramova, who studies technology-driven economic transitions, said the past three years of AI advances mark a sharp break from earlier waves of mechanization.\n\nIn past eras — from 18th-century textile automation to late-20th-century manufacturing decline — the impact was mostly gradual and largely contained to individual sectors, she said.\n\nBut AI is different: \"A single AI model can displace thousands of cognitive jobs across multiple industries overnight,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nAbramova expects layoffs to outstrip new job creation over the next five to 10 years, especially without aggressive retraining efforts.\n\nWhile the exact number of AI-related layoffs is unknown, several major companies have already cited AI as a reason to reduce head count or to announce job cuts.\n\nNew AI-related roles often require skills or credentials that many displaced workers lack, Abramova said, and entry-level positions — such as junior developers, analysts, and customer support staff — are already among the most vulnerable.\n\nPeter Orszag, CEO of Lazard and former director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Obama, sees a similar risk.\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" this week, Orszag said that if AI delivers on its promise, there's likely to be a jobs crisis.\n\n\"Labor markets deal well with small problems that happen fast or big problems that happen slow. They do not deal well with big shocks that happen quickly,\" he said.\n\nAbramova said that the social risks extend far beyond unemployment numbers.\n\n\"History shows social strain emerges when the pace of economic change overtakes institutions' capacity to support displaced workers,\" she said.\n\nShe pointed to the UK's Enclosure Acts, which displaced tens of thousands of small farmers from common land, sparking riots and mass migration, and to the 1980s coal pit closures, which wiped out mining communities almost overnight and triggered years of strikes and political upheaval.\n\nBusiness leaders are divided over AI's impact on jobs, with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Ford CEO Jim Farley warning of widespread white-collar displacement, while Elon Musk, JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon, and OpenAI's Sam Altman have predicted varying outcomes, ranging from significant disruption to long-term prosperity.\n\nOthers, such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Yann LeCun — Meta's outgoing chief AI scientist — say AI will transform work rather than erase it.\n\n\"It's very likely that the companies that use AI first, that use robotics technology first, will be the most successful first, and they will end up hiring more people,\" Huang said in late October.\n\n\"You're going to lose your job not to somebody — not to a robot, you're going to lose your job to somebody who uses a robot. You're going to lose your job to somebody who uses AI,\" he added.\n\nIf governments and employers fail to prepare, Abramova said she expects widening inequality, persistent unemployment, falling consumer demand, rising political anger, and even expanding surveillance as leaders try to contain discontent.\n\nIn extreme cases, she warned, democratic norms can erode.\n\nBut she also said that the worst outcomes aren't inevitable.\n\nThe alternative is worker-augmenting AI: systems where machines handle data-intensive tasks while humans retain judgment, ethics, and client relationships. That shift will require regulatory incentives that reward firms for responsible oversight, not just rapid headcount reduction.\n\n\"Without major support,\" Orszag said, \"many displaced workers risk long-term underemployment.\"",

In front of a huge Nvidia logo, he urged the venture capitalists before him to herald “a new industrial revolution”, announced billions of pounds in AI investments and, like Willy Wonka handing out golden tickets, singled out some lucky recipients in the room.\n\n“If you want to get rich, this is where you want to be,” he declared.\n\nBut his biggest party trick was a surprise guest waiting in the wings. At Huang’s cue, the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, walked out as the crowd whooped at Huang’s pulling power.\n\nStarmer, looking slightly dazed, saluted his host’s “absolutely phenomenal” presentation, told the audience about how he had been “texting away” with Huang and effusively thanked one of the world’s richest men for his “confidence in what we are doing, in your investment, your foresight”. Huang sent him away with a gift: an inscribed AI processing unit.\n\nNot done, Huang called on to the stage Liz Kendall, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, followed by Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for business. The parade of British cabinet ministers at this private Nvidia event spoke volumes about how successfully US tech oligarchs have pulled British politicians – serving and former – into their orbit.\n\nThis week, they landed another big fish. The $500bn Chat GPT maker Open AI hired the former chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne, prompting him to gush he was joining “the most exciting and promising company in the world”.\n\nHe was just the latest senior figure to pass through the revolving door between Westminster and Silicon Valley. In October, the former Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak took advisory roles with Anthropic, one of OpenAI’s main rivals, and with Microsoft, which has invested heavily in both AI startups. Liam Booth-Smith, Sunak’s chief of staff, who sits in the House of Lords, also this summer took a senior role at Anthropic after it signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK government.\n\nThey followed the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who spent seven years leading public affairs for Mark Zuckerberg at Meta, which runs Instagram and Facebook. Clegg is now an AI investor who last week predicted “we will move from staring at the internet to living in the internet”. He made tens of millions of dollars at Meta. Some reports said as much as $100m. He would not confirm that but said he was paid “extremely well”.\n\nMeanwhile, Tony Blair, prime minister for a decade until 2007, is becoming increasingly influential on technology policy, lobbying successfully, through his Tony Blair Institute (TBI), for the UK to introduce a digital ID.\n\nTBI is part-funded by the foundation of Larry Ellison, the founder and chief executive of Oracle. A former TBI policy expert, Kirsty Innes, recently became a special adviser to Kendall.\n\nThe Commons science, innovation and technology select committee is monitoring the revolving door situation. Alex Sobel MP, a member of parliament’s joint committee on human rights, which is currently investigating AI, said: “I am deeply concerned tech companies may be using their huge buying power to water down much-needed regulation by hiring those who have served at the highest level of previous governments.”\n\nJobs with the biggest US AI companies can be a good fit for frontline politicians because they also require comfort with risk-taking, said one tech company insider. Another advantage is that tech leaders do not tend to demand polished management skills. Meanwhile, their value is growing as AI companies increasingly target their products at government clients as well as businesses and consumers. Osborne’s task appears to be to wedge his foot in the door of governments to help OpenAI to inject its technology into the bloodstream of public systems. It already has government-level arrangements with Argentina, Australia, Germany, Norway, the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, the UK, Greece, Estonia and Kazakhstan, but it wants more.\n\nSelling state-level AI is competitive. Palantir, which hosted Starmer at its Washington base in February and signed a strategic partnership with the Ministry of Defence in September, is pushing its systems into health trusts, police forces and local councils in Britain. The company’s UK communications are being led by a former head of strategic communications at Downing Street.\n\nBritain is an important place for AI firms to gain influence: regulations on AI development remain looser than in the EU, its universities foster important innovations, and the UK also has one of the world’s most respected AI safety institutes.\n\nThe revolving door also spins the other way, sending tech industry people into positions of public influence. The UK government last month appointed Raia Hadsell, the vice-president of research at Google DeepMind, as an “AI ambassador”, alongside Tom Blomfield the founder of the online bank Monzo. Blomfield is also a partner at Y Combinator, the San Francisco start-up incubator that used to be led by Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI.\n\nCivil servants from the government’s digital service set up a consultancy called Public Digital, which has since won millions of pounds worth of public contracts. One of its partners, Emily Middleton, last year took a senior director general role in the government’s digital service.",

    "fullText": "Will Drake London return in Week 16? Latest injury update on Atlanta Falcons WR originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Atlanta Falcons haven't had wide receiver Drake London on the field for four straight games now.\n\nLondon suffered a PCL strain in Week 11 and hasn't played or practiced since then. The Falcons have been in no rush to get him back, either, as the team is out of playoff contention.\n\nAs we turn the page to Week 16, here's what we know about London's chances of returning to the field for the Falcons on Sunday.\n\nWhen asked about London's status for Week 16, Falcons head coach Raheem Morris said he's \"very hopeful\" his top wide receiver will return.\n\n“Obviously, got to get to the practice week. I’m very hopeful he can go out there and play for us,\" Morris said, per The Athletic's Josh Kendall.\n\nWe would say London has a better chance to return than not given the fact that he was not placed on injured reserve, which means the Falcons didn't expect him to miss more than three games.\n\nOf course, London has now missed four in a row, but we also have to remember that the Falcons had a short week in Week 15, so that could've played a role in London's absence and maybe he would have been available on a normal week.\n\nLondon has also been day-to-day for multiple weeks now, so he appears to be very close to a return, although his lack of participation in practice last week was not a great sign for him.\n\nThe Falcons do have a decision to make in terms of whether or not to even bring London back. After all, the Falcons are out of playoff contention and might opt to avoid risking London getting hurt again and potentially impacting next season.\n\nThat said, Morris might be fighting for his job over the final three weeks of the season, so it stands to reason he'll want his best player out there.\n\nWe'll get our next update on London on Wednesday, when the Falcons release their first injury report of the week. Even a limited practice would be a good sign for London's chances of suiting up.\n\nWhat Patrick Mahomes tearing 2 ligaments means for recovery timeline\n\nMike McDaniel gives bizarre answer for lack of late-game urgency\n\nMatt Prater injury update leaves Bills in precarious spot at kicker\n\nMicah Parsons' dad weighs in on Packers superstar's return timeline\n\nJaguars offense in midst of streak not seen in NFL this season",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS/LONDON/STOCKHOLM, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The European Commission is expected on Tuesday to reverse the EU's effective ban on sales of new combustion-engine cars from 2035, bowing to intense pressure from Germany, Italy and European automakers struggling against Chinese and U.S. rivals.\n\nThe move, the details of which are ​still being hashed out by EU officials ahead of its unveiling, could see the effective ban pushed back by five years or softened indefinitely, official ‌and industry sources said.\n\nThe likely revision to the 2023 law requiring all new cars and vans sold in the 27-nation bloc from 2035 to be CO2 emission-free would be the European Union's most significant climb-down from its ‌green policies of the past five years.\n\n\"The European Commission will be putting forward a clear proposal to abolish the ban on combustion engines,\" Manfred Weber, head of the European Parliament's largest group, the European People's Party, said on Friday. \"It was a serious industrial policy mistake.\"\n\nReneging on the ban has divided the sector. Traditional automakers like Volkswagen and Fiat-owner Stellantis have pushed hard for targets to be eased amid fierce competition from lower-cost Chinese rivals. The EV sector, however, sees it as yielding more ground to China in the electrification ⁠shift.\n\n\"The technology is ready, charging infrastructure is ready, and consumers ‌are ready,\" said EV maker Polestar's CEO Michael Lohscheller. \"So what are we waiting for?\"\n\nCOMBUSTION ENGINES AROUND FOR 'REST OF CENTURY'\n\nThe 2023 law was designed to accelerate a transition from combustion engines to batteries or fuel cells and fine automakers who failed to meet the targets.\n\nMeeting the ‍targets means selling more electric vehicles, where European carmakers lag Tesla and Chinese producers like BYD and Geely.\n\nEurope's carmakers are making EVs, but say demand has lagged expectations as consumers are reluctant to buy more expensive EVs and charging infrastructure is insufficient. EU tariffs on Chinese-built EVs have only slightly eased the pressure.\n\n\"It's not a sustainable reality today in Europe,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley ​told reporters in France last week, announcing a partnership with Renault to help cut EV costs. Industry needs were \"not well balanced\" with EU CO2 targets, he said.\n\nThe ‌EU granted the sector \"breathing space\" in March, allowing automakers to comply with 2025 targets over three years.\n\nBut automakers want to continue selling combustion-engine models alongside plug-in hybrids, range extender EVs with 'CO2-neutral' fuels - including biofuels made from agricultural residues and waste such as used cooking oil.",

BBC Sport looks at some of the key themes ahead of Sunday's match.\n\nBrentford have won just one of their four Premier League games against Leeds and will be looking to avoid three straight defeats in the Premier League for the first time since February 2024, after losses to Arsenal and Tottenham.\n\nIt was more away day pain for Keith Andrews' side last week in north London as they gave a toothless display at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The Bees had just four shots in the match, with one on target and a measly xG of 0.29.\n\nWhile their mid-table figure of 21 Premier League goals for the season doesn't ring immediate alarm bells, the spread of those goals may be a cause of concern. Striker Igor Thiago has scored over half - and five of his 11 have been from the penalty spot.\n\nRecord signing Dango Ouattara has won four of those penalties, more than any other player in Europe's top five leagues. This game will be Ouattara's last appearance before leaving to represent Burkina Faso at the Africa Cup of Nations. Brentford will need the likes of Mikel Damsgaard and Kevin Schade to fill this creative void. As it stands, veteran midfielder Jordan Henderson leads the way at the club for Premier League assists, with three.\n\nLeeds had lost four straight Premier League games going into their midweek fixture against Chelsea last week, using a 4-3-3 formation. But for the second half against Manchester City in the final fixture of those four defeats, Farke deviated from his usual four at the back to try a 3-5-2.\n\nDespite being pipped 3-2 by Pep Guardiola's side, the performance was encouraging and Farke has since started his side in a 3-5-2 in subsequent fixtures against Chelsea and Liverpool.\n\nThe results have been stark, with four points from two matches against established heavyweight sides and three goals scored in each. It is as many times as Leeds had scored three in the Premier League across their previous 37 games.\n\nBrentford have had mixed fortunes facing the formation. They have won just twice in the seven games they have played in the Premier League against sides using a 3-5-2.",

We've apologised to our customers for the delay, and our teams are working to get their journeys back on track,\" the statement said.\n\nIt can be frustrating for passengers when they're diverted to their origin — a so-called flight to nowhere — but often it's the best course of action.\n\nReturning to Heathrow, BA's main hub, makes it easier for the airline to rebook passengers on alternative flights and fix any problems with the aircraft.\n\nDiverting elsewhere might have also left the plane and crew out of place, disrupting the airline's schedule. Plus, a stopover in Canada or the US may have caused the crew to reach their maximum working hours.\n\nWhen BA Flight 243 turned around, its closest airport was Iqaluit in northern Canada, less than 300 miles away.\n\nSome flights have diverted to this remote town in the past, but it can ultimately be more disruptive.\n\nLast year, an Air France flight diverted to Iqaluit after a burning smell was detected in the cabin.\n\nThe pilots declared an emergency, and a different plane was rerouted to rescue the passengers. It was originally scheduled for another flight, so that had to be canceled. Passengers were then taken to New York, where they were rebooked onto other flights to reach their intended destination of Seattle.\n\nUltimately, it depends on how urgent the diversion is, since safety is the top concern.\n\nHowever, if possible, returning to the flight's origin can be the simplest option for both passengers and the airline.",

London has missed the last three games due to a knee injury and will miss his fourth after sitting out all three days of practice in Week 15.\n\nThe fourth-year wide receiver has 60 receptions for 810 receiving yards and six touchdowns in nine games played this season. London suffered a PCL strain back in Week 11, the same week that starting quarterback Michael Penix Jr. partially tore his ACL.\n\nWhile London has been ruled out, the Buccaneers are getting star wideout Mike Evans back, head coach Todd Bowles announced on Wednesday. Evans has been out since breaking his collarbone in Week 7. Back in Week 1, the Falcons held Evans to just 51 yards on five receptions.\n\nWithout London in Week 15, the Falcons will look to wide receiver Darnell Mooney and tight end Kyle Pitts to pick up the slack on offense. Pitts led the team with six catches for 90 receiving yards in Week 14.\n\nWatch Morris' full Wednesday press conference below.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Falcons Wire: Falcons vs. Buccaneers: Drake London out, Mike Evans to play",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had no time to hold a traditional news conference during a whirlwind, 36-hour trip across Europe this week, so he improvised.\n\nFor the first time since Russia's full-scale invasion of his country, Zelenskyy — who usually takes reporters’ questions in person while trotting the globe — communicated with the news media via group chat. While flying between London and Brussels, he answered a long list of questions from Ukrainian and international reporters, relaying audio clips on WhatsApp.\n\nHis chosen mode of communication was, if not unprecedented, at the very least extremely rare for a world leader.\n\nThe low drone of the aircraft blended with his hoarse, tired-sounding voice, yet his message cut through clearly: Amid uncertain negotiations to end the war, Ukraine, he said, cannot surrender land.\n\n“Undoubtedly, Russia insists for us to give up territories,” he said in a crackling message late Monday. “According to the law, we don’t have such a right … and to be frank, we don’t have a moral right either.”\n\nWith the outlook for negotiations changing by the day, Zelenskyy’s team set out on a jam-packed schedule to shore up support in Europe.\n\nZelenskyy met the leaders of Britain, Germany and France in London, and the heads of NATO and the European Union in Brussels, before traveling on to Rome for talks with the Italian prime minister and Pope Leo XIV.\n\nA key issue being discussed is whether Ukraine should cede Russian‑occupied territory in return for security guarantees, but the talks have been complicated by uncertainty about the Trump administration’s commitment to European security.\n\nSince the start of the war, Zelenskyy has shown a desire to communicate in real-time in whatever way is necessary.\n\nWhen Kyiv came under siege shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, Zelenskyy tried to reassure the public through what appeared to be a cellphone video with three top officials — perhaps his best-known address.\n\n“We are all here,” he said at the time. “Our soldiers are here, the citizens of our country are all here protecting our independence, and we are going to continue to do so.”\n\nSince then, Zelenskyy has made frequent communication a strategic priority in a sleep-defying cycle of video messages, remote speeches to Western parliaments and conferences, late-night posts and high-security public appearances.\n\nMonday night’s WhatsApp exchange wound down as his plane landed in Brussels, just before he was whisked into his next round of meetings.\n\nHe asked reporters: “How did you like this format? If it works for you, then when we have the opportunity, we’ll share our thoughts and decisions this way again.”\n\nIt didn't take long. By Tuesday evening, Zelenskyy had sent reporters more audio messages on WhatsApp to explain how talks to end the war were proceeding with its Western allies.",

    "description": "Luckily for fans who missed their chance, Bon Jovi has added even more dates to their Madison Square Garden residency in July.",
    "fullText": "After a four-year break from the road, Bon Jovi is officially back with the 2026 Forever Tour — Jon Bon Jovi's first full run since his 2022 vocal-cord surgery, a recovery he's discussed as a near career-ender. The tour opens with a nine-show residency at Madison Square Garden in July 2026, followed by stadium dates in Europe, including Edinburgh, Dublin, and three nights at London's Wembley Stadium, which were added due to demand. Keep scrolling to learn how to get Bon Jovi tickets for these shows below.\n\nTo celebrate, the band released Forever (Legendary Edition) on October 24, 2025, a collaborative rework of their 2024 album featuring Bruce Springsteen, Lainey Wilson, Jelly Roll, Jason Isbell, Avril Lavigne, Robbie Williams, and more, plus a new track, \"Red, White & Jersey.\"\n\nIf you’re looking to catch Bon Jovi’s monumental return to the stage for the coming Forever tour, we’ve got you covered. We’ve broken down everything Forever, including the tour schedule, purchasing details, and price comparisons between original and resale tickets. You can also look at ticket details at your leisure on StubHub and Vivid Seats.\n\nBon Jovi’s tour will kick off with an extended nine-show residency at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Following this, the band will head overseas for three shows in Edinburgh, Dublin, and London. The current schedule is set to conclude on September 4.\n\nTickets are available from verified resale vendors such as StubHub and Vivid Seats. As tickets have just gone on sale and demand is high, you may find more favorable seating and pricing options from these sites. We recommend reviewing all available options for the date and location you wish to attend before making your purchase.\n\nPrices vary for Bon Jovi’s upcoming Forever tour depending on the date, location, and demand for each show. On Ticketmaster, original standard tickets, particularly for the New York residency, are in incredibly high demand, with remaining options ranging in the high hundreds to over $1,000 for some premium seating options. In general, the high prices seem to be a result of most affordable seating options having already sold out during the current ongoing presale.\n\nVivid Seats and StubHub, on the other hand, currently offer a wider variety of seating and pricing options, providing more affordable choices overall for those looking to attend the shows on a budget. Both sites have affordable options ranging from $237 to around $300 for the New York performances. Please note that, as of the time of writing, the July 19 New York show, which was most recently announced, has not yet gone on sale. International shows are more affordable on StubHub, starting at £151 for both UK performances, with Vivid Seats offering prices starting at $394. Generally, Vivid Seats tends to offer more limited options for international performances, whereas StubHub often provides a wider variety. The Dublin show is presently not available on either platform.\n\nThere are several VIP packages being offered on Ticketmaster for Bon Jovi’s upcoming Forever tour. Full details of all four packages, the “Legendary” Front Row & Side Stage VIP experience, “Forever” VIP experience, Premium Superfan VIP fan package, and Superfan VIP fan package, can be viewed on Ticketmaster. All packages include premium tickets as well as various perks such as signed merchandise, dedicated VIP staff, VIP lounge access, exclusive gifts, and early entry. Ticketmaster also has limited quantities of VIP packages that include hotel stays as well. We were able to find one Superfan VIP fan package ticket for the July 9 show listed on Ticketmaster for $686 (at the time of writing); however, other shows appear to have no options remaining.\n\nOpeners for the coming Forever tour have not yet been officially announced. In the past, Bon Jovi has regularly supported other artists, including local ones, as openers for their concert tours. Previous years have seen One Republic, Skid Row, Cinderella, Van Halen, Queensrÿche, Daughtry, Kid Rock, and Nickelback support Bon Jovi onstage. With the tour set to start next July, it is expected that more information will become available as the kick-off grows closer.\n\nThe Forever tour will include a five-show residency in New York, followed by three international performances in Edinburgh, Dublin, and London.\n\nBon Jovi’s tour, the Forever tour, is the first in four years and is set to kick off in July 2026. The coming tour marks the first for Bon Jovi since lead singer Jon Bon Jovi underwent vocal cord surgery in 2022.\n\nSince the Forever tour has yet to start, we can't say for certain what songs the band will perform as part of their setlist. Based on their last tour in 2022, here are some songs that might be included in the performance:",

    "description": "Luke Combs' My Kind of Saturday Night world tour kicks off next March in Las Vegas. Ticket prices start at $71.",
    "fullText": "Following several days of teasing on social media, Luke Combs officially announced his 2026 concert series, titled the \"My Kinda Saturday Night\" world tour. With the announcement first being sent to his “Bootleggers” fan club members and then to the general public, fans are eagerly anticipating the chance to see Combs live. With all venues in stadiums and a long roster of opening acts scheduled to join the star, it’s no wonder tickets are already in high demand.\n\nLuke Combs has been praised for his dedication to his fans, and releasing the tour announcement and presale first to his Bootleggers fans has been specifically applauded. The “Fast Car” singer has been quoted as saying he is happy for the chance to promote country music in places where it is not typically found, and his 10 international stops can attest to that effort as well.\n\nIf seeing Luke Combs in concert next year sounds like your kind of Saturday night, we’ve got you covered. We’ve broken down everything Luke Combs and the My Kinda Saturday Night world tour, including purchasing details and price comparisons between ticket vendors. You can also browse concert and ticket specifics at your convenience on StubHub or Vivid Seats.\n\nThe My Kinda Saturday Night tour will kick off in Las Vegas next March, followed by several shows across the continental US and Canada. From July, Combs will embark on a tour of Europe and the UK. The My Kinda Saturday Night tour is scheduled to wrap up on August 2 in London.\n\n*Indicates an event that Luke Combs will be performing at in addition to other artists.\n\nOriginal tickets for the My Kinda Saturday Night tour went on presale on October 15, followed by general sale on October 17, with tickets available for purchase on Ticketmaster. As of writing, all dates still have limited availability for original tickets, and can still be purchased on Ticketmaster.\n\nTickets are also available for purchase from verified resale vendor sites such as StubHub and Vivid Seats. Many popular tour stops, such as Las Vegas, have limited remaining seating options; in such cases, you may find more ideal options on resale sites instead.\n\nWith shows still having yet to sell out, ticket prices between the original and resale options are somewhat similar, with resale options leaning slightly more affordable for certain dates. Original standard ticket prices vary depending on the venue and location, but currently tend to fall within the average range of $100 to just over $300. Many locations even offer pit options under $300 (Knoxville and South Bend, for example), which is very reasonable compared to other artists whose pit tickets can easily exceed $1,000.\n\nAs of writing, for the resale option, Vivid Seats has prices ever so slightly below those of StubHub, with the most affordable options ranging from $71 for the May 2 tour stop in Knoxville to $176 for the May 30 tour stop in Montreal. StubHub ranges from $79 for the same Knoxville show to $244 for the Green Bay performance on May 16. The biggest difference right now is that Vivid Seats has fewer international location options, which is somewhat common for the site in general.\n\nLuke Combs has a guest appearance at Alan Jackson’s event in Nashville on June 27, and prices for this are considerably higher than his own headlining tour’s stops. This is due to the event being large, with several artists performing.\n\nThere are no VIP packages for The My Kind Of Saturday Night tour available for purchase on Ticketmaster.\n\nSeveral artists have been confirmed to join Luke Combs on his upcoming 2026 world tour. For North American shows, Dierks Bentley, Ty Myers, The Castellows, and Thelma & James have been tapped as supporting artists. Europe will continue to see Ty Myers and the Castellows perform, with The Script also joining them for shows in Sweden, the Netherlands, and Ireland. The Teskey Brothers have been announced as an opening act for the Edinburgh show, and Thomas Rhett will also be supporting the London concert.\n\nThe My Kinda Saturday Night tour has 10 international dates currently scheduled. The tour will head to Sweden in July, followed by shows in France, the Netherlands, and Ireland, and will conclude in the UK with five performances in Edinburgh and London.\n\nLuke Combs is an American country singer from North Carolina who first emerged on the scene in 2014 with his debut EP, “The Way She Rides”. He has since gone on to win several Billboard Music and Country Music awards, and also has his own polarized sunglasses and hat company called Blue Otter Polarized. Luke Combs married Nicole Hocking in 2020.",
