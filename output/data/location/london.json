    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had no time to hold a traditional news conference during a whirlwind, 36-hour trip across Europe this week, so he improvised.\n\nFor the first time since Russia's full-scale invasion of his country, Zelenskyy — who usually takes reporters’ questions in person while trotting the globe — communicated with the news media via group chat. While flying between London and Brussels, he answered a long list of questions from Ukrainian and international reporters, relaying audio clips on WhatsApp.\n\nHis chosen mode of communication was, if not unprecedented, at the very least extremely rare for a world leader.\n\nThe low drone of the aircraft blended with his hoarse, tired-sounding voice, yet his message cut through clearly: Amid uncertain negotiations to end the war, Ukraine, he said, cannot surrender land.\n\n“Undoubtedly, Russia insists for us to give up territories,” he said in a crackling message late Monday. “According to the law, we don’t have such a right … and to be frank, we don’t have a moral right either.”\n\nWith the outlook for negotiations changing by the day, Zelenskyy’s team set out on a jam-packed schedule to shore up support in Europe.\n\nZelenskyy met the leaders of Britain, Germany and France in London, and the heads of NATO and the European Union in Brussels, before traveling on to Rome for talks with the Italian prime minister and Pope Leo XIV.\n\nA key issue being discussed is whether Ukraine should cede Russian‑occupied territory in return for security guarantees, but the talks have been complicated by uncertainty about the Trump administration’s commitment to European security.\n\nSince the start of the war, Zelenskyy has shown a desire to communicate in real-time in whatever way is necessary.\n\nWhen Kyiv came under siege shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, Zelenskyy tried to reassure the public through what appeared to be a cellphone video with three top officials — perhaps his best-known address.\n\n“We are all here,” he said at the time. “Our soldiers are here, the citizens of our country are all here protecting our independence, and we are going to continue to do so.”\n\nSince then, Zelenskyy has made frequent communication a strategic priority in a sleep-defying cycle of video messages, remote speeches to Western parliaments and conferences, late-night posts and high-security public appearances.\n\nMonday night’s WhatsApp exchange wound down as his plane landed in Brussels, just before he was whisked into his next round of meetings.\n\nHe asked reporters: “How did you like this format? If it works for you, then when we have the opportunity, we’ll share our thoughts and decisions this way again.”\n\nIt didn't take long. By Tuesday evening, Zelenskyy had sent reporters more audio messages on WhatsApp to explain how talks to end the war were proceeding with its Western allies.",

    "description": "Luckily for fans who missed their chance, Bon Jovi has added even more dates to their Madison Square Garden residency in July.",
    "fullText": "After a four-year break from the road, Bon Jovi is officially back with the 2026 Forever Tour — Jon Bon Jovi's first full run since his 2022 vocal-cord surgery, a recovery he's discussed as a near career-ender. The tour opens with a nine-show residency at Madison Square Garden in July 2026, followed by stadium dates in Europe, including Edinburgh, Dublin, and three nights at London's Wembley Stadium, which were added due to demand. Keep scrolling to learn how to get Bon Jovi tickets for these shows below.\n\nTo celebrate, the band released Forever (Legendary Edition) on October 24, 2025, a collaborative rework of their 2024 album featuring Bruce Springsteen, Lainey Wilson, Jelly Roll, Jason Isbell, Avril Lavigne, Robbie Williams, and more, plus a new track, \"Red, White & Jersey.\"\n\nIf you’re looking to catch Bon Jovi’s monumental return to the stage for the coming Forever tour, we’ve got you covered. We’ve broken down everything Forever, including the tour schedule, purchasing details, and price comparisons between original and resale tickets. You can also look at ticket details at your leisure on StubHub and Vivid Seats.\n\nBon Jovi’s tour will kick off with an extended nine-show residency at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Following this, the band will head overseas for three shows in Edinburgh, Dublin, and London. The current schedule is set to conclude on September 4.\n\nTickets are available from verified resale vendors such as StubHub and Vivid Seats. As tickets have just gone on sale and demand is high, you may find more favorable seating and pricing options from these sites. We recommend reviewing all available options for the date and location you wish to attend before making your purchase.\n\nPrices vary for Bon Jovi’s upcoming Forever tour depending on the date, location, and demand for each show. On Ticketmaster, original standard tickets, particularly for the New York residency, are in incredibly high demand, with remaining options ranging in the high hundreds to over $1,000 for some premium seating options. In general, the high prices seem to be a result of most affordable seating options having already sold out during the current ongoing presale.\n\nVivid Seats and StubHub, on the other hand, currently offer a wider variety of seating and pricing options, providing more affordable choices overall for those looking to attend the shows on a budget. Both sites have affordable options ranging from $237 to around $300 for the New York performances. Please note that, as of the time of writing, the July 19 New York show, which was most recently announced, has not yet gone on sale. International shows are more affordable on StubHub, starting at £151 for both UK performances, with Vivid Seats offering prices starting at $394. Generally, Vivid Seats tends to offer more limited options for international performances, whereas StubHub often provides a wider variety. The Dublin show is presently not available on either platform.\n\nThere are several VIP packages being offered on Ticketmaster for Bon Jovi’s upcoming Forever tour. Full details of all four packages, the “Legendary” Front Row & Side Stage VIP experience, “Forever” VIP experience, Premium Superfan VIP fan package, and Superfan VIP fan package, can be viewed on Ticketmaster. All packages include premium tickets as well as various perks such as signed merchandise, dedicated VIP staff, VIP lounge access, exclusive gifts, and early entry. Ticketmaster also has limited quantities of VIP packages that include hotel stays as well. We were able to find one Superfan VIP fan package ticket for the July 9 show listed on Ticketmaster for $686 (at the time of writing); however, other shows appear to have no options remaining.\n\nOpeners for the coming Forever tour have not yet been officially announced. In the past, Bon Jovi has regularly supported other artists, including local ones, as openers for their concert tours. Previous years have seen One Republic, Skid Row, Cinderella, Van Halen, Queensrÿche, Daughtry, Kid Rock, and Nickelback support Bon Jovi onstage. With the tour set to start next July, it is expected that more information will become available as the kick-off grows closer.\n\nThe Forever tour will include a five-show residency in New York, followed by three international performances in Edinburgh, Dublin, and London.\n\nBon Jovi’s tour, the Forever tour, is the first in four years and is set to kick off in July 2026. The coming tour marks the first for Bon Jovi since lead singer Jon Bon Jovi underwent vocal cord surgery in 2022.\n\nSince the Forever tour has yet to start, we can't say for certain what songs the band will perform as part of their setlist. Based on their last tour in 2022, here are some songs that might be included in the performance:",

    "description": "Luke Combs' My Kind of Saturday Night world tour kicks off next March in Las Vegas. Ticket prices start at $71.",
    "fullText": "Following several days of teasing on social media, Luke Combs officially announced his 2026 concert series, titled the \"My Kinda Saturday Night\" world tour. With the announcement first being sent to his “Bootleggers” fan club members and then to the general public, fans are eagerly anticipating the chance to see Combs live. With all venues in stadiums and a long roster of opening acts scheduled to join the star, it’s no wonder tickets are already in high demand.\n\nLuke Combs has been praised for his dedication to his fans, and releasing the tour announcement and presale first to his Bootleggers fans has been specifically applauded. The “Fast Car” singer has been quoted as saying he is happy for the chance to promote country music in places where it is not typically found, and his 10 international stops can attest to that effort as well.\n\nIf seeing Luke Combs in concert next year sounds like your kind of Saturday night, we’ve got you covered. We’ve broken down everything Luke Combs and the My Kinda Saturday Night world tour, including purchasing details and price comparisons between ticket vendors. You can also browse concert and ticket specifics at your convenience on StubHub or Vivid Seats.\n\nThe My Kinda Saturday Night tour will kick off in Las Vegas next March, followed by several shows across the continental US and Canada. From July, Combs will embark on a tour of Europe and the UK. The My Kinda Saturday Night tour is scheduled to wrap up on August 2 in London.\n\n*Indicates an event that Luke Combs will be performing at in addition to other artists.\n\nOriginal tickets for the My Kinda Saturday Night tour went on presale on October 15, followed by general sale on October 17, with tickets available for purchase on Ticketmaster. As of writing, all dates still have limited availability for original tickets, and can still be purchased on Ticketmaster.\n\nTickets are also available for purchase from verified resale vendor sites such as StubHub and Vivid Seats. Many popular tour stops, such as Las Vegas, have limited remaining seating options; in such cases, you may find more ideal options on resale sites instead.\n\nWith shows still having yet to sell out, ticket prices between the original and resale options are somewhat similar, with resale options leaning slightly more affordable for certain dates. Original standard ticket prices vary depending on the venue and location, but currently tend to fall within the average range of $100 to just over $300. Many locations even offer pit options under $300 (Knoxville and South Bend, for example), which is very reasonable compared to other artists whose pit tickets can easily exceed $1,000.\n\nAs of writing, for the resale option, Vivid Seats has prices ever so slightly below those of StubHub, with the most affordable options ranging from $71 for the May 2 tour stop in Knoxville to $176 for the May 30 tour stop in Montreal. StubHub ranges from $79 for the same Knoxville show to $244 for the Green Bay performance on May 16. The biggest difference right now is that Vivid Seats has fewer international location options, which is somewhat common for the site in general.\n\nLuke Combs has a guest appearance at Alan Jackson’s event in Nashville on June 27, and prices for this are considerably higher than his own headlining tour’s stops. This is due to the event being large, with several artists performing.\n\nThere are no VIP packages for The My Kind Of Saturday Night tour available for purchase on Ticketmaster.\n\nSeveral artists have been confirmed to join Luke Combs on his upcoming 2026 world tour. For North American shows, Dierks Bentley, Ty Myers, The Castellows, and Thelma & James have been tapped as supporting artists. Europe will continue to see Ty Myers and the Castellows perform, with The Script also joining them for shows in Sweden, the Netherlands, and Ireland. The Teskey Brothers have been announced as an opening act for the Edinburgh show, and Thomas Rhett will also be supporting the London concert.\n\nThe My Kinda Saturday Night tour has 10 international dates currently scheduled. The tour will head to Sweden in July, followed by shows in France, the Netherlands, and Ireland, and will conclude in the UK with five performances in Edinburgh and London.\n\nLuke Combs is an American country singer from North Carolina who first emerged on the scene in 2014 with his debut EP, “The Way She Rides”. He has since gone on to win several Billboard Music and Country Music awards, and also has his own polarized sunglasses and hat company called Blue Otter Polarized. Luke Combs married Nicole Hocking in 2020.",
