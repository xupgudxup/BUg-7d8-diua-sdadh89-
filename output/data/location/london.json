    "fullText": "Viktor Gyokeres is closing in on a notable milestone, just two goals shy of matching Alexandre Lacazette’s debut-season tally for Arsenal back in 2017/18.\n\nLacazette scored 17 times during his first season in North London, while Gyokeres is already on 15 after his double against Spurs.\n\nThe Swede had his best game yet for Arsenal during the North London derby, scoring twice as the Gunners won 4-1 away to Tottenham.\n\nAndrea Berta was a strong advocate for signing Gyokeres last summer. While some of the early performances raised questions, it is hard to argue with the numbers he is putting up now.\n\nAccording to Squawka, Gyokeres is nearing a milestone that could put an end to much of the scepticism surrounding his signing.\n\nThe Swedish striker is now within touching distance of becoming Arsenal’s most prolific debut striker since 2018.\n\nWith plenty of games left in the season, Gyokeres needs just two more goals to match Lacazette’s total from that campaign, and he seems well on track to surpass it.\n\nThe Frenchman had a mixed spell at the Emirates, but 17 goals in his first season remains a solid benchmark.\n\nInterestingly, two more goals would also make Gyokeres the top-scoring striker under Mikel Arteta, overtaking Lacazette’s mark from 2020/21.\n\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored 15 goals in the 2020/21 campaign, a total matched by Kai Havertz last season, while Gabriel Jesus’ highest tally came in 2022/23, finding the net 11 times.\n\nGyokeres’ current tally also makes him Arsenal’s leading scorer across all competitions this term, four ahead of Gabriel Martinelli.\n\nEberechi Eze spoke after the Spurs match, highlighting how Gyokeres’ work ethic has become an inspiration around Arsenal.\n\nThe Swede’s finishing in training has been sharp for a while now, and his opening goal against Spurs looked exactly like what he has been showing at London Colney.\n\nThe 27-year-old set himself up well before drilling his shot past Guglielmo Vicario, putting Arsenal back in front.\n\nGyokeres is well-liked inside the club and there is no doubt his teammates are pleased to see him hitting form. With two goals against Spurs under his belt, the focus now shifts to building on that momentum.\n\nViktor Gyokeres clause could cost Arsenal extra €500k\n\nPiers Morgan makes bold Viktor Gyokeres claim after Arsenal’s 4-1 derby win over Spurs",

    "fullText": "Tottenham's heavy north London derby defeat against Arsenal on Sunday just confirmed what everyone already knew.\n\nIgor Tudor's team are in serious trouble.\n\nPerilously perched just four points above the Premier League relegation zone following the 4-1 home loss, Spurs have a multitude of issues to resolve.\n\nThey have not won a domestic league game in 2026 and only two since 26 October 2025, meaning that - aside from bottom club Wolves - 16th-placed Tottenham have the worst form in the division.\n\nNew interim head coach Tudor has a crippling injury list to contend with, plus a forthcoming Champions League last-16 tie to negotiate.\n\nAnd all this is while he is attempting to implement new ideas and avoid the unthinkable scenario of dropping down into the Championship.\n\nSince 1950, Spurs have only spent one season outside the top flight, which was back in 1977-78.\n\nBBC Sport assesses their precarious situation, what relegation might bring and if they are too good to go down?\n\nIn Tottenham's remaining 11 Premier League games they will visit Wolves and have home fixtures against sides around them in the table - Crystal Palace, Brighton, Nottingham Forest and Leeds.\n\nHowever, their record at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this season is frankly abysmal, so can they expect to turn their form around against fellow strugglers?\n\nWith just two wins and only 10 points accrued from a possible 42, only Wolves have collected fewer points on home soil.\n\nWhile sports analytics and data experts Opta place their chances of relegation at just 4.84%, worryingly for Spurs supporters their team have collected just 0.67 points per game since defeating Everton on 26 October.\n\nAnd unless Tottenham can arrest their slump, that would equate to a further seven points, taking them to 36 on the final day of the season.\n\n\"I would be really surprised if they weren't able to fight their way out of it,\" former Spurs midfielder Danny Murphy told BBC Sport.\n\n\"The games coming up are all huge. I think they will have just enough.\n\n\"The fact we are mentioning Spurs going down is unbelievable. It's absolutely ridiculous really.\n\n\"Whether you blame recruitment or the owners, it would be catastrophic for that club. I have heard some fans suggest going down could be the best thing. I just don't see that.\"\n\nTottenham finished 17th last term, but were never really in danger of relegation as then-boss Ange Postecoglou juggled an injury-hit squad with a focus on Europe.\n\nWhile their league form suffered they still scored 64 times and the silver lining was a Europa League triumph over Manchester United last May, which also secured a coveted place in the Champions League.\n\nHowever, their attacking output this season has been underwhelming and they would need to average 2.45 goals per game in their forthcoming fixtures to match the same tally as the previous campaign.\n\nThe long-term absences of Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison have hardly helped matters and a stretched squad was without a total of 11 players last weekend, considerably more than any other Premier League club.\n\nFormer full-back Stephen Kelly believes the \"only reason\" Tottenham may stay up is that other teams are even worse.\n\n\"You look at the fixtures coming and you feel like they are ones they could absolutely lose,\" he said.\n\n\"They need a mentality to be able to perform at home. If you can get back to winning some games that can make a huge difference, but it just doesn't feel like that is going to change between now and the end of the season.\n\n\"I don't really want to admit it, and still feel there are teams that are really poor and won't get themselves out of it [relegation], but the only reason Spurs will be OK is that other teams will do worse.\n\n\"It is not a great thing to be talking about, but is probably going to be the case. It is not looking very good at all.\"\n\nThere has been a number of media reports, external outlining the calamitous cost that relegation would bring to Spurs.\n\nAnd the club would undoubtedly face a significant financial hit if it was to start 2026-27 in the second tier.\n\nBroadcast, matchday and commercial incomes would all be squeezed, while the most recent wage bill sat at around £254m as opposed to the Championship average of £38m.\n\nThere would also be a knock-on effect on transfers, not only in the quality of players the club could attract but also in paying off £337m in outstanding instalments for current players.\n\nBBC Sport's own analysis points to an estimated fall in annual revenue of around £261m as football finance expert Kieran Maguire said: \"In 2023-24, the most Spurs generated an average of £84 per supporter per match, the highest figure in the Premier League.\n\n\"That figure would face significant downward pressure, not from the size of the crowd, but from what clubs can realistically charge.\n\n\"Corporate clients who pay a premium for a home fixture against Liverpool or Arsenal are unlikely to pay the same for a visit from Swansea.\n\n\"There is also great financial vulnerability around sponsorship. The front-of-shirt deal with AIA, worth around £40m a year almost certainly contains relegation clauses that could halve its value.\n\n\"The kit deal with Nike, estimated at £30m annually, is likely to take a smaller hit.\n\n\"Spurs supporters will still buy replica shirts regardless of division, but a reduction is likely. Broader sponsorship and partner agreements across the club would face similar issues.\"\n\nHe added: \"For a club of Spurs' ambitions and financial scale, relegation would not simply be a short-term sporting setback. The economics of English football make recovery a multi-year project.\"\n\nThe phrase 'too good to go down' was widely banded around about the Forest side that won the first ever televised live Premier League game against Liverpool in August 1992.\n\nThe sales of England pair Des Walker and Teddy Sheringham had significantly weakened a group more accustomed to challenging at the top end of the table and in domestic cup finals.\n\nAnd the two-time former European champions, with a squad containing Stuart Pearce, Roy Keane, Steve Stone and Nigel Clough went down in legendary boss Brian Clough's final season in charge.\n\nThere have also been other high-profile clubs that have gone the same way.\n\nFabricio Coloccini, Obafemi Martins, Michael Owen, Damien Duff and Nicky Butt were part of the Newcastle squad relegated in 2008-09.\n\nOn paper the Magpies also looked relatively strong in the 2015-16 campaign, with Aleksandar Mitrovic, Georginio Wijnaldum and Andros Townsend in their ranks.\n\nAgain, that wasn't enough and they joined another former European Cup-winning club, Aston Villa in going down that year.\n\nThe basic premise appears to be that the scrap for survival takes no account of big names - once you're down there anything can transpire.\n\n\"If you keep losing games and confidence drops, it doesn't matter how many good players you have, it gets hard,\" added Murphy.\n\nSheffield Wednesday have never returned since losing their top-flight spot in 2000, with their sorry plight well documented.\n\nLike the Owls, Leeds United have dropped down as far as the third tier since being crowned English champions in 1992, while former Premier League winners Blackburn are currently fighting to preserve their Championship status.\n\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Tottenham - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "The 30-year-old is excited to fight on home soil after bouts in the United States and France in his last outings in the UFC.",
    "fullText": "Mason Jones says he wants to \"show how well he can perform in front of a home crowd\" when he takes on Frenchman Axel Sola in London on Saturday, 21 March.\n\nThe Welshman was beaten by unanimous decision by Ludovit Klein at the O2 Arena in July 2023, his most recent defeat.\n\nJones returned to Cage Warriors, winning four fights in a row before signing a new deal with the UFC in February 2025.\n\nGoing into the third fight of his second UFC deal 'The Dragon' has a chance to banish the demons from that night on which Jones admits he did \"everything wrong\".\n\nJones told BBC Sport Wales: \"I fought a tough guy and made so many mistakes. I'm super excited to go there and reframe it and show that London is a homecoming for me.\"\n\nThe 30-year-old is excited to fight on home soil after bouts in the United States and France in his past two outings in the UFC.\n\n\"It's going to be a massive change for me,\" he said.\n\n\"I fought a Des Moines local in Des Moines, so I was massively away there, then fought a Belgian guy in Paris.\n\n\"It'll be nice to hear the crowd for me for a change.\"\n\nJones is hopeful that a win will push him into contention for a top 15 opponent in the lightweight rankings.\n\n\"When I signed back to the UFC, I said three foundational fights, to secure my footings in the UFC, then I'll get a top 15.\n\n\"If I beat Axel Sola on March 21, I'll be calling for a top 15 opponent.\n\n\"If I don't get one, I'll get an eliminator for the top 15.\"\n\nJones said it is a prospect the UFC have mentioned in passing.\n\n\"They're interested in seeing me touch that top 15,\" he added.\n\n\"I'm happy to win points, to outpoint him for three five-minute rounds.\n\n\"I'm always looking to finish with the excitement of putting him away, but if I can outpoint him I will.\n\n\"If I finish him, they'll offer me a top 15 fight next fight.\"\n\nShould Jones earn a spot in the top 15, he would become only the second Welshman to be ranked in the UFC, following in Jack Shore's footsteps when he beat Timur Valiev in March 2022.\n\nStanding in Jones' way is Sola, who defeated Northern Ireland's Rhys McKee in Paris in September, the same night as Jones' triumph over Oki.\n\nThe Blaenavon native is wary of the threat posed by his opponent.\n\n\"Sola is a 6ft 2in (188cm) southpaw, very big and strong.\n\n\"He started his career at welterweight, moved back to lightweight and he's had one win in the UFC.\n\nJones sees the Frenchman as a \"super exciting\" opponent.\n\n\"He's long, he's rangy, he's powerful, a very dangerous striker and wrestler.\n\n\"We've worked on lots of specifics, I've been doing training camps in lots of different places.\n\n\"I've been working specifically with southpaws for this camp, which means working with some of the youngsters coming through.\"\n\nOne of those who Jones has been working with is unbeaten boxer Kyran Jones who boasts a professional record of 13 wins.\n\nThe Welshman could feature on the bill in Cardiff on 4 April, when Lauren Price defends her WBA, WBC, IBF, IBO and Ring Magazine World welterweight titles against Stephanie Pineiro Aquino.\n\nIn terms of his fighting mentality, Jones is clear in himself.\n\n\"There's three types of fighters,\" Jones said.\n\n\"Martial artists, the traditional who loves the spirit of it, my partner back home is that type.\n\n\"Then there's the athlete who can just do it and perform, the Jon Jones type.\n\n\"Then there's the figure who loves the violence. I'm the pure fighter, I'm ready for a fight 24/7.\n\n\"For me it's just getting so that I can perform at 100% and make the finishes look spectacular.\n\n\"One of the quotes I love is 'It takes a lot of violence to be this peaceful'. I'm in it because I love the violence of it.\"\n\nWhen asked if he had a message for himself in a year's time, Jones was bullish about his ambitions.\n\n\"You better be chipping away at the top 10, otherwise we've given up too much to not want to push.\n\n\"I'm getting better all the time, stronger, fitter, I want it more, I'm wiser.\n\n\"Everyone in this game wants it, but not everyone wants to put the work in.\n\n\"I like to tell myself, either decrease what you want or increase how much you're willing to put in because you can't have it both ways.\n\n\"You either have to want less or give more, I'm giving as much as it needs, I'll keep pushing.\"\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

He was declared dead at the scene.\n\nThe police added that “his death is currently being treated as unexplained\" and an investigation is underway. It is suggested that the victim may have underwent a cosmetic procedure prior to his death, the cause of which is unknown.\n\nA 43-year-old man and a 52-year-old woman were arrested on Friday, February 20, on suspicion of manslaughter. They have since granted bail pending further investigation.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nParke previously made headlines when he was arrested in 2024 after Alice Webb, a mom of five, died at 33 after becoming unwell following a non-surgical Brazilian butt lift or \"Liquid BBL\" at a Gloucester clinic run by Parke and Jemma Pawlyszyn, per Daily Mail.\n\nHe was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, but was not charged. As reported by ITV News, he was due to answer bail this March.\n\nSince starting his plastic surgery journey at age 19, Parke underwent dozen of cosmetic procedures, including multiple nose jobs, filler in his neck, lips and jawline, a BBL and a chin implant.\n\nIn a 2016 interview on the British daytime show This Morning, Parke said he \"never hated\" himself, but over time, plastic surgery became a \"hobby.\" Before his death, he appeared on E!'s Botched twice to address his lip filler and later his liposuction and the appearance of his nose.\n\nParke's sister Sharnelle wrote on Instagram that their family is \"numb, shocked and heartbroken\" over his death in a tribute on Instagram.",

    "fullText": "Viktor Gyokeres was the star of the show and the Player of the Match winner in Arsenal’s 4-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, scoring a brace to reach double figures for Premier League goals this season.\n\nSpeaking after the game, former Arsenal forward Theo Walcott praised Gyokeres’ performance as one of the best he’s seen from the player this season.\n\n“Not just the goals, I felt today he really commanded that position,” Walcott told Sky Sports. “What was smart, at no point did he go see van de Ven. He knew where the weakness was in that Tottenham team.”\n\n“He showed everything that we expect him to bring to this league,” Walcott added. “He brought the best out of the other players around him as well. And that’s what we want to see, that’s what we expected to see coming into this league.\n\n“Massive signing, it’s one of those where you want to give him time, but if they want to win the league he hasn’t been fortunate to have that time. For me, that was the best performance I’ve ever seen from him.\n\n“They played to his strengths today and I think that’s when you’re going to get the best out of Gyokeres. Very confident right now, and that’s what they’re going to need.”\n\nWalcott is right to suggest it wasn’t just Gyokeres’ two goals that made it a good display.\n\nThe striker had an early header well blocked, he went close with a curling effort towards the far post, he set up a great chance for William Saliba with a clever corner routine, and his lay-off to Bukayo Saka ultimately led to Arsenal’s third goal – scored by Eberechi Eze.\n\nGyokeres has certainly had games this season where he’s been less impactful, but he easily could have been involved in three or four goals on this occasion. As for the two he did score, they were both very well taken and well deserved.",

The fire is ready to be lit.\"\n\nSadly for Spurs, the final score on that one was zero out of five.\n\nArsenal were the furthest thing from \"nervous as hell.\" Spurs were the furthest thing from calm and ready. No fires lit here.\n\nSpurs were almost cruelly outclassed as Arsenal's advantage at the top of the table returned to five points, although Pep Guardiola's City have a game in hand.\n\nEze 'wanted to prove something' as he torments Spurs again\n\nEze Arsenal's derby hero again as leaders sink Tudor's Spurs\n\nPremier League Review: Do City smell Arsenal blood despite derby win?\n\nTo sum up this latest Premier League weekend, Manchester City threw down the gauntlet by closing the gap to two points with a tension-filled win against Newcastle United. Arsenal picked it up with relish in this thumping 4-1 win.\n\nIt means that even before the end of February, sights are starting to turn to what might just be a title decider between City and Arsenal at Etihad Stadium on 18 April.\n\nIn the interim, Arsenal have home games against Chelsea, Everton and Bournemouth, along with a visit to Brighton. City travel to Leeds United, West Ham and Chelsea, with relegation strugglers Nottingham Forest to come to the Etihad.\n\nAnd, of course, there might just be a psychological blow to be struck when Arsenal and City meet in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley on Sunday 22 March.\n\nArsenal are now 10 games from the glory that has eluded them since Arsene Wenger's \"Invincibles\" in 2003-04. Destiny is their hands. The twist in the tale is that the same applies to Manchester City.\n\nFor all Arsenal might have wished to play down the significance of this single game in the title context, it was a win and performance they needed desperately to calm concerns on and off the pitch.\n\nAnd this was a consummate display, cool and measured with a ruthless edge, even if it came against this dreadfully poor Spurs side.\n\nEberechi Eze picked the perfect time to return to his best, playing his part as derby tormentor again with two goals to add to the three he got in the 4-1 win at Emirates Stadium in December.\n\nSince that hat-trick, Eze had featured in all 15 of Arsenal's subsequent league games, but had made only four starts and played just 360 minutes before this derby.\n\nIn his last start he was substituted at half-time against Brentford, so credit to Arteta for having the instinct to feel that this was the sort of occasion to suit him, deploying him in the \"number 10\" role against the club who thought they had signed him until Arsenal stepped in to clinch a £60m deal with Crystal Palace.\n\nAnd there was more good news with much-criticised striker Viktor Gyokeres also scoring two fine goals on a perfect day for the Gunners and their ecstatic fanbase.\n\nArsenal were not knocked out of their stride, even after Randal Kolo Muani's bustling equaliser for Spurs two minutes after Eze struck the first blow. This was a confident, reassuring performance.\n\nArteta told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"This was outstanding. I think you have to bring context to the situation and this is the beauty of football.\n\n\"You go to Wolves and you drop two points in the last kick of the match. Watching it back, there is no understanding from my perception how the hell that happened.\n\n\"It feels like the end of the world, but then you have another opportunity and that is the beauty of it. In a difficult stadium, against our rivals, and seeing how much it means to us in the league and all our supporters.\"\n\nHe added: \"This chapter we wanted to write. We have managed it.\"\n\nBBC Sport pundit Danny Murphy expects the race between the two to go right to the finishing line.\n\nHe said: \"The title race is still on massively for both. It's in both their hands, that's unusual. Normally it's in one team's hands and you are just waiting for them to slip up.\n\n\"I have been very much in the Arsenal camp in terms of my eyes telling me they are the best team. The last couple of results have given Man City that little bit of hope. They have a lot of players in the squad who have been there and done it.\n\n\"Speaking from experience, when you have got over the line, the next couple feel easier. Every time Arsenal go on the pitch the pressure is on at the minute. It's great for us and I hope it goes to the wire. I don't see any winning all games from now until the end of the season.\"\n\nArsenal's nerve was put the test. They passed - and more tests will come for the Gunners and Manchester City as the Premier League pursuit reaches its climax.\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place\n\nGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team",

    "description": "MOTD pundit Danny Murphy explains why, as well as Arsenal's superior quality in Sunday's north London derby, they exploited Tottenham's tactical weakness too.",
    "fullText": "Arsenal's superior quality ultimately showed in their 4-1 north London derby win, but they were also very clever with the way they exposed Tottenham's tactical weaknesses too.\n\nSpurs' 3-5-2 shape under new boss Igor Tudor, and the fact they did not just sit in, left space for Arsenal to exploit in forward areas on Sunday.\n\nThe Gunners ran away with the game in the end but, in the first half, when it was still in the balance, the area where they had the most attacking edge was down their right-hand side, where Bukayo Saka and Jurrien Timber were dominant.\n\nIt's never easy to stop a team like Arsenal when so many of their players are playing well, but what the Gunners did really well was produce moments of quality or skill in attack when it mattered.\n\nThey looked back to the levels we have seen them perform at for so long this season - this was a great performance by them, not just a brilliant result.\n\nArsenal pass derby test of nerve as title race looks set to go to wire\n\n'Who's going to get this fine?' - Arteta on derby technology delays\n\nEze 'wanted to prove something' as he torments Spurs again\n\nPremier League Review: Do City smell Arsenal blood despite derby win?\n\nTimber is one of the best attacking right-backs in the Premier League, if not the world, and I have seen him cause many teams problems with the way he mixes his runs up - sometimes he supports, sometimes he overlaps and he can make runs inside too. He is an intelligent footballer.\n\nSaka has had a few people question him recently, but against Spurs he was back on it and back to his confident best.\n\nWith the understanding those two have got, it was always going to be difficult to stop them down Arsenal's right but it was even harder for Spurs because they were reactive rather than proactive in dealing with the danger.\n\nAt times Xavi Simons, who was playing as a second striker, was having to run back to the left-back position to help. On other occasions it was Pape Matar Sarr coming over from midfield, or Mickey van de Ven covering from centre-half.\n\nSpurs' system saw Simons and Sarr left to cover long distances to get back and it also meant there was often a mixture of someone who is not used to defending in those areas - as Sarr was when he was left one-on-one with Saka for Arsenal's first goal - and also not being sure who was doing what, and when.\n\nThat's not ideal against any team, let alone one as good as Arsenal, and Mikel Arteta's side started getting more and more joy down that flank, with Timber often having time on the ball to pick his passes - like he did to find Viktor Gyokeres for their second goal.\n\nTottenham battled really well in the first half and, although the game got away from them after the break, it wasn't through any lack of effort.\n\nThey were set up okay too, but I think it did help Arsenal that Spurs were at home and under a new manager because they were expected to have a go rather than just park the bus.\n\nSpurs tried to press Arsenal at times which leaves you open to counter-attacks and also leaves space in behind, which the Gunners are good at exploiting.\n\nIn the second half, Arsenal's quality shone through and Tottenham looked tired - their lack of numbers because of injuries began to show.\n\nStill, what was impressive from Arsenal when they were 2-1 up is that they did not sit back and try to see out time.\n\nInstead, they were quite ruthless and kept coming forward. That's understandable when you think about what happened to them on Wednesday when they were pegged back by Wolves after leading 2-0.\n\nI wondered what would happen if they got in front this time, and they had obviously talked about what they would do differently.\n\nSo, from that point of view, because of the doubts over their mentality after their past couple of results, it was important to see them play so positively.\n\nThe same applies for some of their individual players, as well as the whole team.\n\nAs well as his two goals, Eberechi Eze had a great game overall. I was pleased for him because he has had a few question marks over his form recently, and we know he is a super talent.\n\nWith him playing so well in the central areas as a number 10, Tottenham's midfielders had something else to worry about - and being busy there meant they could not easily help deal with Saka and Timber out wide.\n\nDeclan Rice was making all these runs too, bursting forward to try to make amends for his mistake for Tottenham's equaliser, so there was all sorts going on.\n\nRice is always influential, of course, but he was especially impressive here. Instead of dwelling on his mistake, he used it to focus and bring more energy and clarity to what he was doing.\n\nWhen he dropped into defence after that, he played it simple and quick with his goalkeeper or centre-half - he didn't risk anything again.\n\nBut when he was going the other way, he was trying everything - making runs, getting on the end of knockdowns, bombing forward and occupying defenders.\n\nHe is always totally focused anyway so it is hard to judge exactly how much difference that mistake made to his performance but it felt to me like he actually upped his game, which takes great mental strength.\n\nThere have been times in the past where, when you are playing Arsenal, Saka and Odegaard are the two players you know you need to stop.\n\nTeams would think, if you can condense play in their areas, you can control them - and if it goes over to another part of the pitch, you can cope with it.\n\nOn Sunday, however, it felt like Arsenal were coming from every angle in the end. Eze, especially, was getting on the ball in these pockets of space in front of the Spurs defence.\n\nThat helped Gyokeres too, because it meant there was more room for him as well.\n\nGyokeres had started well anyway, and had a great early chance which he made himself, but this ended up being one of his best games in an Arsenal shirt.\n\nIt probably helped that he had a yard of pace on Radu Dragusin, who is not the quickest defender, but he played on him nicely and it was clever of him to stay on the left side.\n\nI remember watching a lot of Gyokeres' goals for Sporting and he liked to come off that flank a lot, and we have not seen him do it enough this season.\n\nThat might change now and, when he got his first goal, it was like the weight had been lifted off his shoulders.\n\nSome of the Arsenal fans who are not convinced by him are going to be more on his side now he has scored twice against Tottenham, and his goals were top quality too.\n\nI'd say that was one of his best games in an Arsenal shirt and to do it in a north London derby will do him the world of good.\n\nDanny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

Having been at the centre of a transfer tug-of-war between Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur last summer, Eze has haunted Spurs since opting for their arch-rivals.\n\nEze became the first player in Premier League history to score a hat-trick in the first North London Derby of the season, scoring three times as Arsenal thrashed Tottenham 4-1 at the Emirates.\n\nRecalled to the starting side for the reverse fixture at Spurs this afternoon, he opened the scoring at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for his fourth North London Derby goal of the campaign.\n\nIncredibly, Eze’s goal was his first shot on target in the Premier League since netting his hat-trick goal in that win over Spurs on November 23rd.\n\nHowever, the 27-year-old’s joy was short-lived as Spurs struck back just 24 seconds after the restart.

    "fullText": "Loughborough Lightning toppled last season's dominant force London Pulse 18-17 in the Netball Super Cup final as the new campaign got off to a thrilling start.\n\nDeposed by Pulse as Netball Super League (NSL) champions in the Grand Final last July, Lightning flipped the tables on their rivals who began a dominant 2025 by winning this event 12 months ago.\n\nThese two will be the teams to beat when the new league campaign begins on 27 February, with Lightning the team starting on a huge high.\n\nHead coach Vic Burgess said: \"It's been a really good day from us. We came into this knowing it's a little bit different. It can be tough and it can be quick, and Pulse nearly caught us.\n\n\"I'm really proud of the girls. They were up for it. They were chilled but with a focus on doing well for each other. The girls love winning and I love winning.\"\n\nThe one-day Super Cup features all eight NSL teams, split into two groups for round-robin matches before the semi-finals and final stage.\n\nThe 14-minute matches are far removed from the usual 60-minute games but it was a strong form guide last year when Pulse took the spoils and went on to triumph in the NSL for the first time.\n\nLightning co-captain Nat Panagarry said there had been a sense of \"feeling sorry for yourself\" after last year's Grand Final defeat, fuelling Saturday's win.\n\nLeeds Rhinos and Cardiff-based Dragons occupied the bottom two spots in the NSL last season but both reached the semi-finals here and looked revitalised.\n\nHowever, Nottingham Forest, preparing for a second season as a Netball Super League club, fell in the group stage after defeats by Loughborough and Dragons.\n\nGroup 1: Loughborough Lightning 23-21 Nottingham Forest, Dragons 18-6 Birmingham Panthers, Forest 14-12 Panthers, Lightning 18-15 Dragons, Dragons 15-9 Forest, Lightning 19-18 Panthers\n\nGroup 2: Leeds Rhinos 16-9 Manchester Thunder, London Pulse 15-8 London Mavericks, London Pulse 21-13 Manchester Thunder, Mavericks 13-13 Rhinos, Mavericks 19-8 Thunder, Pulse 13-12 Rhinos\n\nSemi-finals: Lightning 13-9 Rhinos, Pulse 18-16 Dragons\n\nInternational commitments over the winter months have interrupted pre-season preparations and that was a common message from coaches as some teams coped better than others on the big stage.\n\nIn front of packed stands at one of the UK's largest indoor arenas, Birmingham Panthers and Manchester Thunder both lost three from three.\n\n\"It's been a tough day,\" said Thunder coach Karen Greig, whose side lost their three games heavily to make an early exit.\n\nThunder will face NSL champions Pulse in the league's opening match, with more than 5,000 tickets sold for that Copper Box encounter.\n\nGreig has brought England goal shooter El Cardwell back to England after a successful stint in Australia while Thunder also have fellow Roses star Nat Metcalf back after she missed last season when pregnant and looking after baby son Miller.\n\nBut it was to no avail at the Super Cup.\n\n\"Today was about us understanding where we were actually at,\" Greig said.\n\n\"The performances and the connections on the court definitely highlighted that.\n\n\"The quality that we've got in our group is undeniable and it's about us now making sure we get everyone on the same page and connected.\"\n\nThere was no such problem for Lightning while Pulse took consolation from being a whisker away from another major title.\n\nAs Pulse coach Sam Bird said: \"I'm not too worried.

    "description": "In the context of a Premier League title race, there hasn't been a more meaningful meeting between Arsenal and Tottenham in at least two decades.",
    "fullText": "North London derby presents Arsenal with so much to lose and everything to gain in Premier League title race originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMikel Arteta has been preaching to Arsenal fans that the Premier League title race is a marathon not a sprint.\n\nYet after a gut-wrenching 2-2 draw with Wolves that left the Gunners' lead atop the table slimmed to effectively just two points, the quest for an elusive league crown has reached a breaking point.\n\nThat's where Arsenal's most hated rivals, Tottenham Hotspur, come in.\n\nAs the Gunners search for answers in their hunt for their first Premier League championship since 2004, they are presented with the perfect opportunity for an emotional and impactful turnaround.\n\nIn truth, this North London derby couldn't have come at a better time. It is likely their most important meeting with Spurs in the last two decades, one with more to lose, and also more gain than any in recent memory.\n\nMORE:A full roundup of Arsenal team news and injury updates ahead of the match against Tottenham\n\nThe Gunners' hunt for the 2025/26 Premier League title has never felt shakier than when Tom Edozie bundled home the awkward equaliser for Wolves at the end of their recent draw.\n\nArsenal have been the frontrunners for the EPL championship for much of the last four months. Every time they've opened the door, nobody has been there to walk through it.\n\nYet with just 10 points from their last possible 21, Arsenal have now opened the door wider than before. Manchester City sit five points back with a game in hand, with just a sliver between the two sides with still 12 matches remaining.\n\nMikel Arteta has used up all the cushion that Arsenal had built with their strong run through December, but they are still in the lead, an important and critical distinction.\n\nThe Gunners have one of the softest run-ins of any club this season. Following their upcoming games against Tottenham and Chelsea, Arsenal will finish the year with just one remaining match against the Big Six clubs, being the all-important April 18 match against Man City.\n\nCommon opponents over the final eight matches of the season for the two title chasers are Burnley, Crystal Palace, and Bournemouth. That leaves Arsenal with games against Newcastle, West Ham, and Fulham while Man City have Aston Villa, Brentford, and Everton.\n\nArsenal's current form is miles from that of a title-winner, but they still have it all in front of them.\n\nThe one thing Arsenal has been missing from their title hunt has been a reliable attacking superstar.\n\nBukayo Saka was meant to be that player. The 24-year-old England winger just sealed a new contract which sees him become one of the highest-paid players in the Premier League.\n\nWith his reported new wages \"in excess of £300,000 per week,\" he finds himself amongst the likes of Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk, and Bruno Fernandes, all of whom have been reliable performers week-in and week-out. Yet Saka cannot yet count himself amongst those individuals, who have all been key performers in a title-winning season.\n\nYet Saka just has not been that player this season. Sure, injuries have taken a bit of a toll, but he still has had plenty of chances to be a star. Five goals and five assists in 23 games just isn't enough to propel a team to a title.\n\nArsenal has been a true team of contributors this season; there's no question that their depth has been an enormous asset. Yet at the end of the day, titles are won by superstars, and right now, there is a lack of stars on Arsenal.\n\nIt's hard to remember a time when fans of a club the stature of Arsenal were chasing a domestic title with such nervous tension.\n\nArsenal have not won a Premier League title since the Invincibles in 2004, that much has been well documented over the last decade. They have also never won a Champions League crown. It has left this current generation of Arsenal supporters with very little to show for their last 20 years of dedication.\n\nYet because the club is such a behemoth both in England and across Europe, they are expected to, in effect, act like they've been here before.\n\nBut they haven't. Not really. All these fans know is disappointment and near misses. They have repeatedly come up short, having finished second in each of the last three years.\n\nThat's why the Wolves draw felt like such a gut punch. This is the feeling they're so familiar with — as the craving for silverware ramps up, they are repeatedly fed with letdowns.\n\nThis is not to drive in the dagger further, but to explain why they are so uncomfortable in this position. There's no confidence to draw from, only dread.\n\nAll of that, however, can change this weekend. This all leads to Sunday's North London derby...\n\nIn terms of the Premier League title race, there hasn't been a more meaningful meeting between Arsenal and Tottenham in at least two decades, if not longer.\n\nThe last time these two teams met with these kind of stakes, Arsenal clinched their 2003/04 title with a 2-2 draw in late April, but they coughed up a 2-0 lead in that match and had a solid lead that had been inevitable for weeks.\n\nThe Gunners also secured a big 3-2 win over Spurs late in the 2023/24 chase, but that still wasn't enough to push them to the title.\n\nThis year, this game presents a titanic opportunity, and also a huge potential pitfall. Draw or defeat in this match would give Man City the chance to take an effective lead in the title race, a collapse which would serve as a crushing blow both tangibly and emotionally.\n\nYet on the opposite end, there is so much to gain.\n\nThe best chance for an emotional result against the club's biggest rival would be now, as it would erase much of the recent struggles and catapult the feeling of authority atop the Premier League back to the highs of recent months before the slide.\n\n\"The enjoyment comes from moments of suffering as well,\" Mikel Arteta professed after the disappointing draw with Wolves. \"If you believe that you come to any ground in the Premier League and you don’t have to go through tough periods, that’s not the reality, so the enjoyment comes as well from those moments when you’re not at your best. Ok, get through and find out a way to come through that.\"\n\nArsenal have suffered much this season, both to their success and their detriment. Some would argue they have inflicted too much self-imposed suffering on themselves to be Premier League champions. To that end, their 58 points through 27 games is the fewest of any Premier League leader at this point in a season since Leicester City 10 years ago.\n\nVictory here, and Arsenal's title race is once again full steam ahead. Anything less, and the train comes off the track. There's really nothing in between at this point.",

    "description": "What's eating Arsenal? Sunday's North London derby is now a test of the Gunners' \"bottle\", says chief football writer Phil McNulty.",
    "fullText": "Arsenal's north London derby trip to Tottenham Hotspur will be played out against a backdrop of searching questions about their nerve - \"bottle\", as it is often called - character and even public mockery from their rivals.\n\nThe most basic question is this. Are Mikel Arteta's side choking amid Arsenal's greatest opportunity to win the Premier League for the first time since Arsene Wenger's \"Invincibles\" of 2003-04?\n\nThe landscape around this trip to hostile territory has shifted so dramatically in the last fortnight that it has moved from what resembled a walk in the park to a test of every quality required to win the title.\n\nArsenal will go to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium - where Spurs have won only two of 13 league games this term - with the toxicity caused by former head coach Thomas Frank's presence potentially removed by his sacking and replacement by Igor Tudor.\n\nTudor's appointment is essentially designed to avoid relegation.\n\nHis chequered managerial career has taken in Hajduk Split, Galatasaray, Udinese, Marseille, Lazio and Juventus.\n\nFor all that, Tudor has specialised in fast starts in charge of clubs, a powerful personality whose arrival delivers an extra ingredient to what was already going to be a super-charged atmosphere.\n\nIt all adds up to a severe examination of Arsenal just as they look to be creaking under the pressure of chasing that elusive Premier League crown.\n\nArsenal remain top of the table. They finished top of the Champions League standings with eight wins from eight games. They face Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final and have an eminently winnable FA Cup fifth round tie at League One side Mansfield Town.\n\nArsenal's catastrophic concession of a 2-0 lead at relegation certainties Wolves, as well as the way in which that advantage was lost, was an example of tension that has gripped the Gunners on and off the pitch in a run of only two wins from seven Premier League games.\n\nAs if that collapse at Molineux, concluded amid angry scenes involving players from both sides, was not enough, Wolves' social media accounts rubbed salt in Arsenal's wounds by poking fun in a TikTok post captioned \"Game Management\".\n\nIn a post watched by more than two million, it was aimed at Arsenal's perceived time-wasting at corners and what was clearly regarded as an over-reaction to injuries.\n\nThere was also an image of Gabriel Martinelli taunting Wolves' fans with a \"2-1\" gesture, only to look daft when Arsenal conceded that late leveller.\n\nWolves' time-wasting jibe was followed by an Opta statistic that Arsenal have taken a league-high total of 117 minutes to restart games from corners this season. They also have the longest average delay of restart from corners at 44 seconds.\n\nLow blows from Wolves, but blows that may have landed on already frayed nerves.\n\nThe chaotic manner of Wolves' 94th-minute equaliser from Tom Edozie - eventually going in off Riccardo Calafiori - summed up Arsenal's panic-stricken finale as goalkeeper David Raya collided haplessly with defender Gabriel to cause confusion.\n\nWhat was an opportunity to apply psychological pressure by extending their lead to seven points was squandered, leaving Arsenal only five clear of Manchester City having played one game more.\n\nIt was Arsenal's recent problems in microcosm.\n\nRaya and the Gunners' defence have slipped from the high standards that gave them a nine-point advantage over City and Aston Villa on 7 February, albeit that Pep Guardiola's side had a game in hand.\n\nArsenal's fate still remains in their own hands. The problem is that the same applies to City, with the sides scheduled to meet at Etihad Stadium on 18 April.\n\nAnd this is where the nerves and the past play into the current narrative that Arsenal are wobbling, having finished second in the last three campaigns, twice to City and last season to Liverpool.\n\nArsenal exactly where we want to be - Arteta\n\nThe eerie similarities between Arsenal's 2007-08 collapse and now\n\n'Bottle word will be used' as Arsenal blow title advantage\n\nIn this chase, Manchester City have form for successfully hunting down league leaders.\n\nArsenal's form at this stage of the season is unflattering when compared to City's. In each of the last four campaigns, City have amassed more points than Arsenal in the final 12 games.\n\nThe biggest differential was 12 points in 2021-22, the narrowest one point in 2023-24, when a 2-0 loss at home to Aston Villa on 14 April effectively cost Arsenal the title.\n\nAnd several factors are now coming into play as Arsenal need to prove they can cope with the pressure of ending that barren title run, with City breathing down their necks.\n\nSince their 4-1 win against Aston Villa on 30 December, the ring of steel Arsenal assembled in defence has lost its strength. They have subsequently conceded one league goal per game as opposed to 0.61 before.\n\nArsenal have also appeared to drop into a more risk-averse, negative approach when in front and looking to have games under control.\n\nLeads have been lost against Manchester United, Brentford and - most damagingly - Wolves in recent weeks.\n\nIs the fear of losing, or drawing, turning up the pressure valve on players who will know this season represents their best chance of winning the title to such an extent they are now struggling to close out victories?\n\nIt is a highly pressurised environment. This season there are no excuses. It may just be now or never.\n\nArteta invariably cuts an agitated figure on the sidelines. He recently urged Arsenal's fans to \"jump on the fun boat\", but does not look as if he is having fun at the moment, even though he is leading a team top of the table and insists \"the present is beautiful\".\n\nHe says he will be \"keeping calm, keeping my eyes open, my ears open, and understanding what the players need to give their best\".\n\nArteta added: \"We have to live the present. What we did in the past is great, but we have to live the present, and the present is beautiful.\n\n\"We are exactly where we want to be in every competition. We need to earn it, like we've done in the last seven or eight months.\"\n\nGetting to this position, and it is a healthy one, is another factor in the equation. Are the physical demands starting to take their toll on players?\n\nMartin Zubimendi, outstanding since his summer move from Real Sociedad, is one such example.\n\nHe has seen more Premier League action than any other Arsenal outfield player, figuring in all 27 games with 26 starts, playing 2,270 minutes in his first season in the English top flight.\n\nEberechi Eze has almost been a bystander in comparison, despite the fanfare that greeted his £60m arrival from Crystal Palace in August, stolen away from Spurs at the 11th hour.\n\nSince scoring a hat-trick in the 4-1 win against Spurs in November, Eze has featured in all 15 of Arsenal's league games but has made only four starts and played 360 minutes.\n\nThe wider questions, however, surround Arsenal's temperament to withstand the pressure that is suddenly closing in on them, an ominous reminder of previous failings.\n\nArsenal are still in a superb position in every competition – positions they would have instantly signed up for in August. And their cause could be helped the return of key duo Martin Odegaard and Kai Havertz.\n\nIf the Gunners win at Spurs, doubts will be eased, but one thing is beyond question.\n\nThis north London derby is now a completely different proposition from a fortnight ago.\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Creators say they’re offering Africans a ‘hopeful, utopian feeling’ of retrieving objects looted by colonial armies\n\nA new South African video game lets players take back African artefacts held in western museums in a series of heists, amid a growing campaign to repatriate treasures looted by colonial armies.\n\nPlayers of Relooted become South African sports scientist and parkour expert Nomali, as she leaps and dives through museums to retrieve 70 real objects. They include an Asante gold mask that was taken by the British army when it destroyed the Asante empire’s capital, Kumasi, and is now in the Wallace Collection in London. Another object is the skull of the Tanzanian king Mangi Meli, which was taken to Germany after its colonial regime executed him in 1900.\n\nHundreds of thousands of culturally and spiritually significant items were looted from Africa during the 19th and 20th centuries, when European countries carved up the continent into colonies. A 2018 report commissioned by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, estimated that more than 90% of Africa’s material cultural heritage was held outside the continent.\n\nBerlin’s Ethnologisches Museum and Cambridge University are among the institutions to have returned Benin bronzes to Nigeria, for example. Others, including the British Museum, have resisted calls to return bronzes and other looted objects.\n\nBen Myres, chief executive of Nyamakop, which developed Relooted, said: “Real-life repatriation is enormously complicated and it’s been ongoing for decades, in some cases even a century or more … We’re giving people this hopeful, utopian feeling … of what it’s going to feel like when all these artefacts finally come home.”\n\nMyres started creating the game in 2018 after his mother returned from the British Museum outraged at seeing the Nereid Monument, a Lycian tomb from Turkey. The museum says it was brought to the UK “with the full permission of the Ottoman Turkish authorities”.\n\n“She was shocked by the audacity of stealing a building … and she very flippantly said you should make a game about taking this back to where it belongs,” he said.\n\nThe game was created by a team from more than 10 African countries, while voice actors were hired from the countries of the characters that make up Nomali’s heist crew.\n\nMohale Mashigo, the game’s narrative director, said: “If we were going to go as far as researching real artefacts, getting a pronunciation guide for the artefacts, creating these characters from Cameroon, DRC, Malawi and [more], I wanted to make sure it sounded like different voices from different places.”\n\nMashigo created an “Africanfuturist” vision of the continent at the end of the 21st century, with cities and countries that “work for people”, rather than the more fantastical genre of Afrofuturism.\n\nIn contrast, Europe and the United States were intentionally made generic, as “The Old World” and “The Shiny Place” respectively. “We wanted to parody the way the west represents Africa,” Myres said.\n\nThe museums are also not real, apart from the Museum of Black Civilisations in Dakar, where players return the looted objects to an symbolically empty hall before they make their final journey to their home country.\n\nFor the game producer, Sithe Ncube, it was important that the Kabwe Skull, a 300,000-year-old fossil discovered in her country, Zambia, was included. The skull, also known as Broken Hill Man, is in London’s Natural History Museum.\n\nShe said: “Even before I started working at Nyamakop … I just felt like … someone should get it back and it would be cool for someone to do this in some form of media, in a game.”\n\nCreating Relooted was an eye-opening experience, Ncube said. “Learning about the scale of artefact looting in Africa, up to now I still can’t wrap my head around the numbers. It seems quite ridiculous and probably underestimated as well.”",

    "fullText": "The best football fixtures of the coming weekend features the North London Derby, a huge cup clash, and action from Italy and Germany.\n\nThe fifth round of the Women’s FA Cup has thrown up some tasty matchups this weekend, the biggest of which sees Chelsea host Manchester United at Kingsmeadow on Sunday.\n\nIt’s a repeat of last year’s final, which the Blues won 1-0 at Wembley. The Red Devils are out for revenge and sit one point above the west London outfit in the Women’s Super League table. This is also a primer for next month’s League Cup final and promises to be a cracker.\n\nThere’s also the Merseyside Derby between Liverpool and Everton later in the day. It kicks off at the same time as the North London Derby in the Premier League, but this game will be on Channel 4, so it’s a perfect alternative if you have a Sky Sports subscription.\n\nKick-off: 1.30pm, Sunday 22nd February\n\nWhere to watch: TNT Sports 1, Discovery+\n\nIconic Duos – Chelsea’s impregnable pairing made of steel and silk, Terry and Carvalho\n\nThe battle for Europe is intensifying in Serie A. Third-placed Napoli are in a strong position to qualify for next year’s UEFA Champions League, but with Juventus just four points adrift in fifth, they cannot afford to drop many points with 13 games to go.\n\nAtalanta, who are five points off the top four, are outsiders to qualify for the competition, but a win here would make a huge statement. Their poor start to the campaign has been firmly put behind them under new manager Raffaele Palladino, who is yet to oversee a league defeat in 2026.\n\nLa Dea also cannot afford to drop points at this stage of the season given they are neck and neck with Cesc Fabregas’ Como, who occupy sixth place and the UEFA Conference League qualifying spot.\n\nKick-off: 2pm, Sunday 22nd February\n\nWhere to watch: BBC Alba, BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport website, DAZN\n\nRead – Every player to score four goals in a Champions League game\n\nThe form side in the Bundesliga is not Bayern Munich, but Borussia Dortmund. They are are unbeaten in their last 15 league outings, and are currently enjoying a six-game winning streak.\n\nThat has brought them within five points of leaders Bayern, who were assumed to be champions-in-waiting yet again, but are cautiously looking over their shoulder at BVB.\n\nLeipzig away is a tricky test for Dortmund, but also one they should be confident of passing if they want to challenge for the title.\n\nKick-off: 5.30pm, Saturday 21st February\n\nWhere to watch: Sky Sports Football\n\nRead – 90s Hitmen: The Divine Ponytail, Roberto Baggio\n\nThis is an absolutely huge game for Manchester City, who can at least temporarily close the gap to leaders Arsenal with a win at Eastlands on Saturday.\n\nThey will be heavy favourites against Newcastle United, who made the long jaunt to Azerbaijan in midweek. The Magpies will be buoyed by their 6-1 mauling of Qarabag, though, and will be out to prove that they can juggle European and domestic commitments against one of the best sides in the Premier League.\n\nKick-off: 8pm, Saturday 21st February\n\nWhere to watch: TNT Sports 1, TNT Sports Ultimate\n\nRead – Guardiola ‘couldn’t care less’ about title race ahead of Newcastle clash\n\nThere has not been such a gap in quality between Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal in well over two decades, perhaps even longer than that, but this is one of the most intriguing North London derbies in recent memory.\n\nOn paper, this should be a cakewalk for the Gunners. Their neighbours are in disarray and sacked their head coach after failing to win a single Premier League game in 2026 so far. But Mikel Arteta’s men are having problems of their own; their title charge is starting to come off the tracks after winning just two of their last seven games.\n\nThe total chaos displayed at the back in the lead-up to Wolves’ late equaliser in midweek screamed of a team creaking under the pressure. But the question is: do Spurs have the means to take advantage?\n\nThe Lilywhites were dismantled when they went to the Emirates Stadium earlier this season, but they have a new man in the hot seat. The combination of a new manager bounce from Igor Tudor and the desperation to stop their biggest rivals winning the title gives them added hope of getting something from a team on edge.\n\nKick-off: 4.30pm, Sunday 22nd February\n\nWhere to watch: Sky Sports Main Event, Sky Sports Premier League\n\nPower Rankings – Arsenal slip, Barça slide, Real Madrid rise\n\nSee Also – Chelsea defender cites Liverpool duo as role models\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube | TikTok",

    "fullText": "Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola has been speaking to BBC Radio Solent before Saturday's Premier League game against West Ham at the London Stadium (kick-off 17:30 GMT).\n\nHere are the key lines from his news conference:\n\nIraola confirmed there were no new injury concerns for this weekend, with David Brooks and Tyler Adams \"ready to go\", while Marcus Tavernier returned to training and they will make a late call on his availability.\n\nOn playing more away games against teams in the bottom half of the table in this second half of the season: \"We are getting better results, we are getting some wins and I hope we can continue. But I think this one is especially difficult considering the circumstances where West Ham are and the run that they've had recently.\"\n\nThe Bournemouth boss feels the Hammers have been \"one of the best teams lately in the Premier League\" and his side need to \"be ready to start strong\" to prevent West Ham from scoring first, as they have done in recent games.\n\nAfter receiving a touchline ban for his third yellow card of the season, Iraola has been discussing how he plans to help from the stands: \"I don't wear the thing on the ear and I'm close to the analyst. Normally I go with Ryan [Dawes], and he's the one communicating everything. But it's true that we sometimes, with the subs, we use just text messages. So we see everything clear.\"\n\nHe does not yet know where he will be sitting in the stadium and is a \"little bit worried\" about the time it might take to get to the dressing room at half time, so they will just have to \"see what the best option is\".\n\nOn Marcos Senesi's future after the defender didn't move in the January transfer window: \"I think the situation is still open. I think it's not easy. We have references from other seasons and sometimes they decide to re-sign, sometimes not, but I don't think Marcos has taken any decision.\"\n\nHear full commentary of West Ham v Bournemouth on Saturday from 17:30 GMT on 5 Live and BBC Sounds\n\nFollow all of Friday's Premier League news conferences and the rest of the day's football news\n\nGot a question about Bournemouth?

    "fullText": "Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has urged his side to use the \"pain\" of a shock 2-2 draw with Wolves when they look to revive their Premier League title challenge against arch-rivals Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nThe Gunners were on course for a routine win on Wednesday after goals from Bukayo Saka and Piero Hincapie put them 2-0 up at Molineux.\n\nBut bottom of the table Wolves hit back through Hugo Bueno and Tom Edozie.\n\nThe draw left Arsenal, bidding to end a 22-year-wait to be crowned champions of England again, just five points clear of second-placed Manchester City.\n\nIt was the second match in a row where Arsenal had dropped points following a draw with Brentford and meant they have now won just twice in their last seven league games.\n\nCity, who have a game in hand, twice chased Arsenal down to win the Premier League in both the 2022/23 and 2023/24 seasons and their April clash with the Gunners could prove pivotal to the title race.\n\nBut Arteta said: \"I'm going to be the first one to be close with them (the players) because it has nothing to do with attitude or desire, it is completely the opposite.\n\n\"It's part of football. Where it could've gone wrong today, it went wrong.\n\n\"If you look at the way we conceded the two goals today without conceding any other situations, it is very rare but it happens. And it happened for a reason and we need to react.\n\n\"If you are at the top you have to win and win, that's nothing new.\"\n\nArsenal are away to struggling Tottenham in a north London derby on Sunday, with Arteta saying: \"We need to go through the pain and go through it looking in the mirror and understand what the game requires now and the next action is Sunday. We need to keep all that in our tummies to show it on Sunday.\"\n\nMeanwhile Saka told Arsenal.com: \"It's pretty flat. We're pretty disappointed with the result, it's the only way to describe it.\n\n\"I think it's a game of two halves. In the first half we started so well but in the second half we dropped the level and got punished for it.\"\n\nLooking ahead to the derby match, the England international added: \"It was already a big game and now it's still a big game...It's still in our control so we just need to focus on that, fix the issues we're having now and get back to winning ways.\"",

    "fullText": "Manchester United have made an impressive start to 2026.\n\nThey have won seven matches in a row across four different competitions. The latest was an edgy 2-1 win over the London City Lionesses.\n\nManager Marc Skinner spoke to The BBC after the match and outlined his joy at his side winning ugly.\n\nCommenting on the result, he said, “to use a Manchester term, I’m absolutely buzzing. I’m so happy for the team and everyone behind the scenes, but particularly the players.”\n\nThe head coach also opened up on the difficulty of maintaining this winning run with so many matches in such a short period.\n\nHe elaborated, “it’s not easy to come off the pitch that we played on mid-week [against Atletico Madrid], get back at 4am and produce a winning performance today.”\n\nSkinner explained, “London City made it very difficult for us, but I just believe this team will always find a way.”\n\nUnited played particularly poorly by their high standards and managed only two shots on target in the entire match.\n\nThey also faced another injury concern with Jayde Riviere, having already lost Anna Sandberg in Madrid.\n\nCommenting on the problems his side faced, he added, “the amount of challenges we had in the game… I put [midfielder] Lisa Naalsund in about seven different positions.”\n\nHe also argued that his side were missing their usual energy and cohesion. Not for the first time this year, he praised his squad depth, claiming the players he brought on “were incredible”.\n\nSkinner concluded, “we just needed to get through today – we really did. The most successful teams in the country have done it for many years. Chelsea have definitely done that. We can mix our style and what you saw today was just a special spirit in the group. They never give up.”\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "## Why...",
    "fullText": "We started CoLoop in 2020 while still at university. We survived multiple cofounder breakups and all sorts of other near-death experiences. Despite that we built our first product to $1M ARR… and then killed it after realising the opportunity was too small and we didn't have real PMF. We spent six months pivoting, and through that process came to understand just how important customer research is to finding a winning strategy. So we built a product to make it faster, cheaper, and better.\n\nWe don't tell you this because we think suffering is something to aspire to. We tell you because if you're an ex-founder evaluating whether to work for someone else, you should know who you'd be working for. We are not going to sell early, get comfortable, or lose interest. This is everything to us.\n\nWe also take seriously that you're trusting us with your time. Three people who've worked at CoLoop have gone on to become YC founders. When you're here, we'll share everything we know and everything we learn along the way. All we ask is total commitment. And if you eventually get the itch to build your own thing again, we will back you 100%.\n\nWe're looking for ex-founders who want to write code, ship product, and work on hard problems in agentic AI.\n\nAt CoLoop, engineers own the full cycle. There are no product managers. You gather context, decide what to build, build it, launch it, measure the impact, and iterate. We track individual attribution in PostHog. One engineer recently drove 40 new active users through a single small growth experiment.\n\nThe structure is flat. Influence is earned through skill and context. We'd rather you make a wrong call than wait to be told what to do.\n\nWe think ex-founders tend to work well here because the expectations match how they already think: own the problem, move quickly, care about customers, and measure what matters. If you've built and run a company before, the pace and autonomy at CoLoop will feel familiar.\n\nIf you failed to find PMF, we're building the product that helps companies avoid that fate. Your experience is valued here.\n\nBonus: you've led an engineering team of 3+ people; you have experience with enterprise customers.\n\nIf you're excited about this role but don't meet every requirement, we'd still love to hear from you. If you’d like to meet the team, we host CoLoop CoWorking from our office most Saturdays!",

    "fullText": "Manchester United pulled off yet another Fergie time heist, this time away at West Ham United on Tuesday, as they came away from the London Stadium with a point.\n\nThe visitors were far from their fluent best and struggled to create anything of note, with the summer signings, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, unable to break down the Hammers’ low block.\n\nThe squad also appears ill-equipped to deal with the pressures of playing twice a week, and Michael Carrick’s blushes were only spared by a stoppage-time equaliser from Benjamin Sesko.\n\nThe Slovenian’s smart finish ensured United remained in fourth position in the Premier League table.\n\nTalking to TNT Sports after the match, the 22-year-old revealed that he was delighted with his goal but disappointed with the result.\n\nHe explained that the Red Devils lacked intensity, which was the main reason behind the disappointing performance.\n\n“I’m happy with my finish, but yeah, not so happy with the draw, because I know we deserve the win because we were fighting till the end.\n\n“Unfortunately, these days come when you’re a bit unlucky. Maybe the intensity was not exactly what it should be. But yeah, we were fighting. In the end, we got a draw, which is really important.”\n\nTo plenty of the away fans, it will almost feel like a win given the dramatic circumstances of the goal.\n\nThe former RB Leipzig striker also revealed that the camaraderie between the players and the desire to work as a unit have been helping the team over the line since Carrick came onboard.\n\n“We are working together no matter what is happening. If we are behind, if we are in front, it does not matter as we are always fighting. As I said again, today, was important to get this draw, because it was difficult game for us.\n\n“They were dangerous on the counter attacks when they took a ball. But yeah, we managed to finish with one. We feel amazing. We are doing everything together. When difficult moments are coming, we’re facing it together, which is really important and can lead to the results like right now.”\n\nThe Slovenian international further explained that a bit more energy and focus will be required for the team to return to winning ways once they return to action in two weeks.\n\n“I think we just have to keep on going like we were doing the last games. Just we have to keep in mind that we have to breathe for each other, and we have to we have to take care in every single situations, every every second of the game, to be focused, to be on point, and obviously when the chances are coming to finish them.”\n\nFeature image Justin Setterfield via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

Their total of 33 points through 25 matches puts them 10 points back of fifth-place Chelsea, meaning a shot at a Champions League place next year is almost certainly out of the question.\n\nThe Sporting News is following the Tottenham vs. Newcastle match live, providing score updates, commentary, and analysis.\n\nMORE:Busting the myth that Arsenal are \"boring\" with their set-piece focus in the new tactical meta\n\nLocation: Tottenham Hotspur Stadium (London, England)\nReferee: Anthony Taylor\n\nKeep track of every game and every goal via SN's live Premier League scoreboard.\n\nTottenham (3-4-2-1, right to left): Vicario (GK) — Palhinha, Dragusin, Van de Ven — Gray, Gallagher, Sarr, Spence — Odobert, Simons — Solanke.\n\nNewcastle (4-3-3, right to left): Pope (GK) — Trippier, Thiaw, Botman, Hall — Guimaraes, Tonali, Willock — Elanga, Woltemade, Barnes.\n\n📲 Follow The Sporting News on WhatsApp\n\nFollowing the game, this section will be updated with analysis of the Tottenham vs. Newcastle match.\n\n1 hour to kickoff: Let's have a look at the starting lineups. Dan Burn, Jacob Ramsey and Anthony Elanga all come back in for Newcastle, who have Anthony Gordon leading the line and both Yoane Wissa and Nick Woltemade on the bench.\n\nHow we line-up at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this evening 💪 pic.twitter.com/gatlQw67nX\n\n— Newcastle United (@NUFC) February 10, 2026\n\n2 hours to kickoff: For the second straight season, Tottenham are experiencing polar opposite fortunes in Premier League and European competitions. While they sit 15th in the Premier League table 25 matches into Thomas Frank's debut season, they managed to secure a fourth-place finish in the league phase of Champions League action.\n\nThat's key for Frank who now gets room to breathe as they recover their Premier League position, not scheduled to compete in the Round of 16 in Europe until the middle of March. Thanks to their early FA Cup exit, Spurs won't play again after this match until February 22.\n\nWith a debilitatingly long injury list to push through, that extra time will be vital to get the squad back closer to full fitness.\n\nFollowing the game, this section will be updated with post-match reaction from Thomas Frank, Eddie Howe, and players.\n\nMORE:An in-depth rundown of all the latest Tottenham team news and injuries\n\nCristian Romero is suspended for four matches after his red card last time out against Manchester United. His challenge on Casemiro was deemed serious foul play, meaning a three-match ban. An additional game is added on to the suspension because it was Romero's second Premier League red card of the season.\n\nDestiny Udogie, Kevin Danso, Pedro Porro, and Djed Spence are all dealing with injuries. Spence is the only one with a chance to play in this match, while the others need a few more weeks.\n\nLong-term absentees include Rodrigo Bentancur, Mohammed Kudus, Lucas Bergvall and James Maddison, all of whom need until at least April before returning, if not longer.\n\nAnthony Gordon and Lewis Miley are both considered game-time decisions, with the former recovering from a minor hamstring injury and the latter working through a dead leg.\n\nJoelinton will not take part in this match, Eddie Howe confirmed, as he battles back from a groin injury.\n\nTino Livramento, Fabian Schar, and Emil Krafth are also out, with the latter potentially back soon while the other two need significantly more time before returning.\n\nTottenham Hotspur Stadium (London, England)\n\nCraven Cottage (London, England)\n\nTottenham Hotspur Stadium (London, England)\n\nVilla Park (Birmingham, England)\n\nChampions League (knockout playoffs — 1st leg)\n\nAzersun Arena (Baku, Azerbaijan)\n\nEtihad Stadium (Manchester, England)",

    "description": "Arsenal are top of the league, fighting for trophies in four competitions and at the same time £64m striker Viktor Gyokeres looks to be finding his feet in north London.",
    "fullText": "Viktor Gyokeres looks to be finally finding his feet in north London as Arsenal chase trophies in four competitions.\n\nIt may have gone under the radar but the Sweden striker is one of the Premier League's most in-form players.\n\nThe forward has struggled at times since his move to Arsenal but there are signs he has turned a corner and is starting to show how he scored 97 goals in 102 games for Portuguese side Sporting.\n\nSince the turn of the year, Gyokeres has netted six goals across all competitions - more than any other Premier League player.\n\nThat stat may be a bit misleading as Arsenal have played 11 games in 2026, which is more than most other sides in the Premier League because of their involvement in the Carabao Cup, Champions League and FA Cup alongside their top-flight fixtures.\n\nBut that does not take away from the fact Gyokeres is starting to look more confident.\n\nHis double against Sunderland means he has now scored six goals in his past eight appearances in all competitions and has registered goals in back-to-back league games for the first time this season.\n\nThe 27-year-old's form looks to be coming at the right time for the Gunners as they bid to end their six-year wait for a major trophy.\n\nThere are signs Gyokeres could benefit from the return of Kai Havertz to Arsenal's XI.\n\nWhen Gyokeres was signed, it was thought he would be battling with Havertz for the number nine role, with the Germany attacker more likely to play the big matches due to his all-round game, and being a favourite of manager Mikel Arteta.\n\nHowever, since Havertz has returned from a knee injury, Arteta has deployed him in a midfield role in games against Portsmouth, Kairat, Leeds United and Sunderland.\n\nAnd with Mikel Merino out after foot surgery, Martin Odegaard sidelined with a knee issue and fixtures against sides Arsenal were expected to dominate, Havertz has played in a deeper role - and there are signs a connection between him and Gyokeres is developing.\n\nThe pair combined for the opening goal against Kairat and the second in the win over Sunderland.\n\nSix of Gyokeres' eight league goals have come against newly-promoted sides.\n\nThe Gunners beat all of the newly-promoted clubs last season but have found it difficult to break down teams who defend in a low block, which is where Gyokeres' goalscoring ability could play a big part as Arsenal's title challenge gets to the final stages.\n\nLast season, Arsenal dropped points away at Everton - but Gyokeres' goal from the penalty spot ensured the Gunners took all three points during this campaign.\n\nScoring against newly-promoted sides does not take away the significance of his goals as Sunderland have been one of the surprise packages of the season.\n\nHowever, Gyokeres' league goals have won Arsenal just two points.\n\nOnly three of his 13 goals in all competitions have changed the state of the game after he scored the opening goals against Burnley, Everton and Kairat.\n\nA criticism of Gyokeres before he signed was that he was a flat-track bully, mainly scoring against teams lower in the Portuguese table.\n\nHe averaged 1.18 goals per game in the Primeira Liga in 2024-25 according to Opta, but only managed two goals in eight games against the sides that finished second and fifth, while 17 of his 39 goals (43.6%) came in seven games against the bottom four.\n\nGyokeres' style of play is not the most pleasing on the eye but can be effective.\n\nBut Arteta now has Gabriel Jesus and Havertz to complement the forward, his impact can also come from the bench.\n\nHe has scored three goals from six shots in seven games when coming off the bench, compared to 10 goals from 55 shots in 25 games as a starter.\n\nGyokeres was signed for his ability to find the net but he was also brought in to create space for the attackers behind him.\n\nAnd that thinking, despite any personal struggles for him on the pitch, has been proved right.\n\nArsenal have a better win percentage (84%) and concede fewer goals when he starts.\n\nThe stats show Arsenal score more without Gyokeres starting but have conceded more without him too, which highlights the work-rate and willingness to help the team out.\n\n\"I love his character,\" Arteta said when asked about Gyokeres' mental strength and resilience after the win over Sunderland.\n\n\"The way he approaches every single day and the fact that he's so focused on the present, what he has to do and he has a genuine will to help the team in whatever role he has.\n\n\"When you put that shirt on, it comes with a lot of responsibility and huge expectations. And you need to live with that. In your journey here, you're going to have moments where it goes really well and others where it's going to be tough.\"\n\nThe scrutiny on Gyokeres has been high since the moment he signed, with the club desperate to win a trophy after so many near misses.\n\nHis goal record and the fact he took the number 14 made famous by Arsenal's record goalscorer Thierry Henry added to that.\n\n\"With Viktor, when you look at him, it's very difficult to understand his emotions because he looks straight at you and you don't really know,\" Arteta said.\n\n\"But he doesn't seem too affected by the real highs or the lows.\n\n\"And that's what we need - stability. He's very demanding of himself. He's constantly trying to improve, and that's really, really good.\"\n\nIt may have been tough for Gyokeres at times but there are a lot of games left with some potentially special moments for Arsenal to come.\n\nNow that the forward is finding the net, he is putting himself in position to be a huge part of that.\n\nAdditional data collection and visualisations by Chris Collinson\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

West Ham have a mountain to climb.\n\nWest Ham have won each of their last three home league matches against Manchester United.\n\nThe Red Devils have lost four of their last six Premier League games against the Irons.\n\nWest Ham completed a league double over United last season and drew 1-1 at Old Trafford earlier this campaign.\n\nThe Hammers have lost only three of their last 15 midweek Premier League home fixtures, while United have won just one of their last nine midweek away league matches.\n\nNuno will again be without Jean-Clair Todibo, who serves the second match of his suspension following his recent red card.\n\nLukasz Fabianski also remains sidelined with a back injury.\n\nAxel Disasi is expected to continue in defence after making his debut against Burnley, likely partnering Dinos Mavropanos at centre-back.\n\nNuno said he did ‘really well’ versus Burnley, and he should get the starting berth.

    "fullText": "Dani Carvajal finds himself in a tricky situation at Real Madrid. Even though he has been back from injury for over a month, he has found game-time hard to come by under manager Alvaro Arbeloa.\n\nThe 34-year-old right-back has only played twice since returning, clocking less than 30 minutes on the field, with Arbeloa preferring Federico Valverde, and now David Jimenez, and Trent Alexander-Arnold ahead of the club captain.\n\nThe manager seemed to suggest after the Valencia game that Carvajal was not yet fully ready to return and did not want to take any risks.\n\nNow, AS reports that Carvajal travelled to London last week to undergo knee tests at a world-renowned specialist clinic.\n\nThe captain of Real Madrid was forced out of action in October last year due to the presence of a “free intra-articular body” in his kneecap, which caused him significant problems.\n\nHaving undergone arthroscopic surgery, Carvajal spent two months on the sidelines to recover from the problem.\n\nCarvajal has fully recovered from his knee issue. (Photo by Juan Manuel Serrano Arce/Getty Images)\n\nAnd, the tests carried out in London last week showed that issue has now been overcome, with the defender submitting the medical report to the club’s medical staff.\n\nCarvajal made the trip to England accompanied by Antonio Rudiger, who was familiar with the London clinic from his time at Chelsea and also took the opportunity to undergo a check-up.\n\nThe visit clarified doubts about that “free intra-articular body” which had been causing concern at Valdebebas. There is nothing serious. He is fit to play.\n\nDespite that, the 34-year-old right-back is not playing for Real Madrid, which could further jeopardise his place in the Spain squad for the World Cup.\n\nLuis de la Fuente wants Carvajal in the team, but also wants him to play regularly so that he can arrive at the tournament with form and rhythm behind him.\n\nSo, in case, his situation at Real Madrid does not improve, the veteran could lose his spot in the La Roja squad.",

    "fullText": "LONDON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate said on Monday they were deeply concerned by revelations in the Jeffrey Epstein files amid further damning disclosures about the heir-to-the-throne's uncle, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.\n\nThe younger brother of ​King Charles, already cast out of the royal inner circle over his close relationship with Epstein, has faced fresh ‌scrutiny since the recent publication of millions of new documents relating to the late convicted U.S. sex offender.\n\nWhile Charles and his wife Camilla said in October that their ‌thoughts and sympathies were with the victims and survivors of abuse, Monday's comment by the Prince and Princess of Wales was the most pointed message so far from the royal family on the scandal.\n\n\"The prince and princess have been deeply concerned by the continuing revelations,\" their spokesperson told reporters ahead of the prince's arrival on a high-profile trip to Saudi Arabia. \"Their thoughts remain focused on the victims.\"\n\nANDREW AND EPSTEIN AN EMBARRASSMENT ⁠FOR KING AND ROYALS\n\nMountbatten-Windsor was forced to quit ‌all official royal duties in 2019 over his ties with Epstein and, in October, King Charles removed his title of prince. Last week, he was forced to move out of his royal mansion.\n\nIn 2022, he ‍settled a lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre which accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager, through her association with Epstein. Giuffre died by suicide last April.\n\nThe 65-year-old second son of the late Queen Elizabeth has always denied any wrongdoing and has not responded to requests for ​comment since the latest release of Epstein files.\n\nWhile the royal family have attempted to distance themselves from Mountbatten-Windsor, he remains a thorn ‌in their side.\n\n\"Charles, how long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?\" a man shouted from the crowd as the king arrived in Clitheroe, northern England, the second time he had been heckled in a week.\n\nIn the latest files released in the U.S., emails suggest he shared official British trade documents with Epstein in 2010, after Epstein's conviction for child sex crimes, leaking information from his then-official role as a government envoy.\n\nThe documents appear to show that Andrew forwarded Epstein reports about Vietnam, Singapore and other places that he had ⁠been sent in relation to an official trip.\n\nTrade envoys are usually barred from ​sharing sensitive or commercial documents.\n\nPOLICE ASSESS ANDREW OVER POSSIBLE DISCLOSURES TO EPSTEIN\n\nThames Valley ​Police said the issue had been reported to them and that they were assessing whether to formally investigate, \"in line with our established procedures\".\n\nLast week, police said they were reviewing a new allegation against Andrew, triggered by the ‍latest files, involving a woman being ⁠taken to an address in Windsor near London, where he has lived on the royal estate.\n\nOver the last 10 days, revelations from the files have also engulfed Prime Minister Keir Starmer in what is widely viewed as the biggest crisis of ⁠his premiership for having appointed Peter Mandelson, an acquaintance of Epstein, as ambassador to the U.S.\n\nLike Andrew, it appears that Mandelson also shared sensitive government files from ‌2009 and 2010 with Epstein, and police are investigating claims of misconduct in public office.",

    "fullText": "This is a really difficult game to unpack — for large parts we competed as equals with arguably the best team in world football, yet the scoreline reads a 3-0 loss. A third away loss in which we have conceded three.\n\nWhile two of Arsenal’s goals contained pieces of genuinely top-quality play, for the most part, we limited them to a number of small chances, with each side’s xG pretty similar (1.02 v 1.03). I don’t really care for xG; it is a quantitative metric that can hardly be realistically quantified — what the hell does it actually mean in real-world terms? But here it is a useful barometer. We barely gave them real chances in earnest, and barely had any ourselves.\n\nOmar Alderete was suspect for both goals — the first emanated from a poor giveaway in his own defensive third, and he looked to have allowed Viktor Gyökeres far too much space as he scored the second, yet I really find it difficult to actually blame him for either. That finish from Martin Zubimendi quite literally hit the one part of the goal (or post) that would actually lead to a goal, and Leandro Trossard (the Premier League’s premium underrated player) created the second with a world-class through ball.\n\nThe third, while an effective counter-attack, came purely from us pushing to score, and immediately after what I thought was a penalty for Saliba dragging down Dan Ballard to the ground with both of his arms. It was an undeserved result which flatters the hosts. Yet, regardless of that, their quality shone through. Many of their players are truly world-class in their passing range and shooting that was shown on the day, and trying to break that defence is like just hitting a brick wall after some promising interplay in the middle of midfield.\n\nMany of us had hope, but probably very few actually thought we would win today. Arsenal seem to be picking up momentum and are one of the most well-drilled teams I’ve seen in a long time. They look formidable in defence and manage to find a way through stubborn defences.\n\nWe created probably just one real chance ourselves — Brian Brobbey’s potentially-going-wide shot in the first ten minutes, which was cleared off the line, but still looked to be quite competitive in midfield, defence and from set pieces. Brobbey himself battled well all afternoon, getting the best of William Saliba, annoying the hell out of every Arsenal fan in the stadium and had the league’s most physical, dominant force bouncing off him from Enfield to Islington. Yet again, we sit here after another x-goals-to-three loss.\n\nThere were some very strong performances throughout the side; Nordi Mukiele and Reinildo got the better of their wingers for the most part, Robin Roefs and Dan Ballard were dominant in the air, and others further up battled and linked up well. Yet we didn’t do much in attack. Arsenal’s goals were all genuine quality, but also all felt a bit soft. It’s been a weird afternoon of oxymorons. A good performance, yet a poor result. A promising day, yet another loss on the road.\n\nAgain, we stopped their set-piece threat. Arsenal’s 0.19 xG from set-pieces is their second-lowest in a game this season (the lowest was us at the SoL). And again, I apologise for the use of xG, but in a baffling afternoon, where I’m actually not absolutely fuming that we just lost 3-0, and probably quite enthused by our overall performance, it is helping provide clarity.\n\nOne positive from the day was the late introduction of Nilson Angulo, who did not look out of place at all. He came on and played on the right wing to see the game out and looked bright in spells. What was mostly self-evident, though, was his willingness to defend, track back and physicality in challenges. Something that always eluded Simon Adingra during his time on Wearside, and a non-negotiable for Régis Le Bris.\n\nWhat is self-evident is that we are not getting relegated. But if we really want to dream big and aim for Europe, this away form must be rectified. Missing Xhaka is an enormous factor, with 50% of the away games in which we have conceded three or more all coming during his absence, but it is bigger than that. It is now eight away games without a win on the road, and while our home form is imperious, the formula to get three points on the road needs to be found.\n\nBut if we put in this type of overall performance at home to Liverpool on Wednesday, I’d be pretty confident of finding a result.",

    "description": "It was another tough trip to London as the Lads were seen off by the Gunners. What did our writers make of it?",
    "fullText": "I don’t believe for one second that there wasn’t a single Sunderland player out there that wasn’t trying their hardest from the first minute.\n\nWhat we saw was our absolute best effort. And if that’s not good enough, well…it is what it is. Unlike against West Ham and Brentford, I think we really gave it our all but we came up against the best team walking the planet right now.\n\nNobody likes losing, but you have to be a big enough man to admit that we were just beaten by the better side, and that was the case here.\n\nArsenal are short odds to win the quadruple this season, and you can see why — they’re a relentless winning machine who can turn over even a very good side giving in their best effort, and we need to just take that as a fact and on the chin.\n\nI can bet that Gabriel and William Saliba haven’t faced anything as difficult as Brian Brobbey this season. I thought he was brilliant, and single-handedly gave them their biggest physical test of the campaign.\n\nWe got a taste of in the game at the Stadium of Light earlier in the season when Brobbey got in ahead of Gabriel for our equaliser, but yesterday they faced a fitter and stronger Brobbey, and I was really impressed with the way he played.\n\nHe’s getting better and better, and the only real criticism you could have is that he maybe could’ve done better with his chance early in the game, but that would be nit-picking. He was my pick for man of the match and I bet the Arsenal defenders will be glad they’re not playing against him again for a while.\n\nI don’t even think the three ‘mistakes’ that occurred leading to the Arsenal goals were particularly brutal, but against a team as good as Arsenal, you can’t even get away with the slightest of discrepancies.\n\nThat’s just a lesson we have to learn — you need to be perfect to get anything from a game away at the Emirates!\n\nYet another absolute clown officiated the game.\n\nSamuel Barrott was terrible, and really needs to look at the way he performed. Saliba should have been sent off for persistent fouling, he should have given a penalty after a foul from Martin Zubimendi on Dan Ballard, and Riccardo Calafiori got away with murder time after time, too.\n\nI’m getting sick of whingeing about the officials but it would be neglect if I didn’t continue to raise the issue of officials treating Brobbey and Ballard differently to other players simply because they’re physical and give as good as they get.\n\nOverall, I think we actually played quite well.\n\nThe scoreline flattered them really as I thought we stayed in the game for a good long while. We didn’t create many clear cut chances but we had more of the ball than expected and used it well at times. I got the impression that they were relieved to get the second goal and even after that, I think it was only the third goal that really killed us off.\n\nOf course, we still lost the game, but we’ve definitely played worse than that this season. Arsenal are one of the best teams in the world so there’s no shame in getting beat — especially if we actually put in a solid performance.\n\nHe made the right decision each time he got the ball and he was sharp and exciting to watch. He wasn’t on the pitch long but he gave a good first impression of himself and hopefully he can continue to integrate well with the squad and make an even bigger and better impact on the team for the remainder of the season.\n\nI was surprised to hear on the radio that our last away win was that terrific victory at Stamford Bridge in October. Since then, we’ve picked up some good points on the road against the likes of Tottenham, Liverpool and Brighton, but we haven’t been able to get all three.\n\nOur home form has been able to generate us a lot of points, meaning that poorer performances away from home haven’t left us struggling, but it would be great for our away form to improve soon.\n\nI thought the referee was really poor.\n\nBrian Brobbey and Dan Ballard hardly ever get anything from referees, but this was especially bad. Brobbey’s whole game plan is to pin and spin the defender but every time he did that, William Saliba almost had the shirt off his back and the referee gave nothing — and it’s the same with Ballard.\n\nEvery time he’s in the opposition box for a free kick or corner, there are multiple defenders surrounding him. They know how much of a threat he is and he always ends up getting dragged to the floor. If he got the treatment he gets in the box anywhere else on the pitch, it would definitely be given as a free kick.\n\nI’m aware that these interactions are hard to referee as Ballard and Brobbey are tussling with their opponent too, but it is getting more and more frustrating to see. It’s also become a recurring theme for referees to rule in favour of the “Big Six” teams and that was painfully obvious.\n\nThey’re clearly terrified of facing Mikel Arteta’s “wrath” — which is more like pathetic whinging.\n\nWe looked confident in possession and played some lovely football at times.\n\nPerhaps too much of this was deeper than the final third, but when we did progress forward, there were some intricate moves involving our creative players.\n\nAs a team, we’re growing in confidence and although we lost, we can take heart from how we took the game to Arsenal at times.\n\nIt’s been said that we don’t score enough goals, but it’s a work in progress and now we have Brian Brobbey up to full fitness and Habib Diarra back in the side, we have more of a physical and athletic threat going forward.\n\nThis is giving Enzo Le Fée and Chemsdine Talbi more options on the ball, and we’ll score plenty more goals between now and the end of the season.\n\nOmar Alderete has been superb this season but he did something I’ve been wary of for some time — made a few unforced errors.\n\nSometimes he’ll give the ball away cheaply or do something completely unexpected, such as kicking a misplaced long pass out of play.\n\nThankfully, the pros far outweigh the cons, but I’m sure he’ll be working hard to iron out those occasional flaws.\n\nWe have another big game coming up midweek and with very little room for rotation, our players will need to dust themselves down ready to go again in just a few days against Liverpool.\n\nFortunately they’ll be back at home with the red and white army in full voice to roar them on. There should be no pressure on the Lads against he current champions and I hope they have enough in the tank for another big game.\n\nThe West Ham game was pretty poor but while this was a similar score it wasn’t a similar performance at all. The Lads gave it a good go and if the early chance for Brian Brobbey had gone in, it could’ve been a very interesting game.\n\nIt was a good battle but we lost to a better team and that’s OK.\n\nWe have to remember we came up via the playoffs and we just competed better than many sides at the home of the champions-in-waiting. That can’t be written off as anything less than good progress.\n\nThe first goal needed a perfect shot masked by defenders and in off the inside of the post to give them the lead, and that was the theme of the game.\n\nThroughout the game, they had to come up with real quality to get past us and that’s a compliment to our lads.\n\nTime and again, the commentators said that wasn’t a 3-0-type loss, and the boys can take a lot from that.\n\nThe potential injury to Sadiki is a worry as the man is a total football athlete.\n\nHopefully it was precautionary and he can be back very soon.\n\nThe first goal came about due to us not closing players down, and we need to learn from this.\n\nWe may be able to trust Robin Roefs against many sides from range but at home (with the Leandro Trossard goal) and away, we gave top quality players too much space.\n\nA lesson to learn, and we will.",

    "title": "Score Predictions: Can Sunderland Shock The Gunners?",
    "description": "A trip to the Emirates is always tough, but can the Lads upset the odds in North London today?",
    "fullText": "Score prediction: Arsenal 2 Sunderland 2\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Habib Diarra\n\nArsenal aren’t invincible at home, as Manchester United proved recently, so there’s no reason we can’t get something in North London.\n\nOf course it’s going to be an incredibly tough game, but it’s one the Lads will relish and it’s as free a hit as we’ll get this season.\n\nI’m going for 2-2, with Habib adding another goal to his tally to open for us.\n\nScore prediction: Arsenal 1 Sunderland 1\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Habib Diarra\n\nThe Lads did really well at home on Monday and gave themselves a bit of a bye for this as a result. If we’d lost to Burnley the pressure would be on, but we were ace and they were shit, so all good.\n\nI honestly think we can also get something from the Liverpool home game, which I’m chuffed to have tickets for.\n\nToday is about trying to do as well as we can, picking up no injuries and seeing what we can get on an away trip which is as hard as they get (and I say that considering the Mags game as well, as they’re falling apart at the seams just now, both on and off the pitch)\n\nGet a point and come home for a game against the Scousers in the week with a full compliment please, boys — and maybe a wee cameo for Nilson Angulo. That would be nice.\n\nScore prediction: Arsenal 1 Sunderland 1\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Enzo Le Fée\n\nIt was great to bounce back resoundingly against Burnley, with a really professional and clinical display. In particular, (nearly) two goals from Habib Diarra was fantastic for the lad, who alongside Chemsdine Talbi looked like brand new signings after their AFCON absence.\n\nGoing away to title-chasing Arsenal will be a tough affair, but they had a game midweek against Chelsea and are potentially missing Bukayo Saka and Martin Ødegaard, which should give us a boost.\n\nLet’s also not forget how we bullied them in the reverse fixture and that we’ll likely approach this meeting in the same manner. They’ll hate us getting in their faces and pushing them around, and we’ll need our usual suspects — Dan Ballard, Nordi Mukiele, Brian Brobbey, to name a few — getting stuck in and hassling these lads.\n\nIt’a a very tough place to go but I know we can give them a real game — and why not leave with a point for our troubles?\n\nScore prediction: Arsenal 3 Sunderland 0\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: N/A\n\nThis is about as hard as it gets. That said, we’ve shown this season that we don’t roll over, especially against the better sides.\n\nIf we stay organised, keep our discipline, and make it awkward for them, we can give them something to think about. We’ve already proved we can compete at this level, and this is another chance to test ourselves.\n\nIf it doesn’t quite fall for us, so be it, but there’s no reason we can’t make a proper game of it.\n\nScore prediction: Arsenal 1 Sunderland 0\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: N/A\n\nIt was a fantastic result on Monday and we rarely got out of first gear, but Arsenal will be an entirely different beast.\n\nThey might’ve lost their first home game against Manchester United the other week, but they’re still flying high in all competitions.\n\nWhilst our home form is flawless, we’ve really struggled on the road and to take anything from this would be a phenomenal result. I was tempted to back a draw but I feel Arsenal will have too much for us today.\n\nScore prediction: Arsenal 1 Sunderland 1\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Wilson Isidor\n\nI think we’ll be well up for this after Monday night.\n\nWe have to ensure complacency doesn’t creep in — and I think Arsenal won’t take this as lightly as they did at the Stadium of Light.\n\nThat said, I reckon we’ll give them a proper game. They’ll score early on and keep the ball for about seventy five minutes, then we’ll nick one towards the end.\n\nScore prediction: Arsenal 2 Sunderland 0\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: N/A\n\nIt was a relief to set things straight immediately after a poor result at West Ham — particularly with the next two fixtures being Arsenal and Liverpool. It was also a great boost that we did it without captain Granit Xhaka, but I’m pretty gutted for him to miss out on a trip to his former employers.\n\nWe gave Arsenal a hell of a game at the Stadium of Light back in November, but I feel this is a very different proposition away from home, where we’ve picked up just two wins all season.\n\nWe’ll undoubtedly put up a fight again but we’re up against the league leaders, who still have the stingiest defence and are the second highest scorers. We do have a tendency of elevating our game against the big clubs, but I’m struggling to see anything but a comfortable Arsenal win today.\n\nScore prediction: Arsenal 1 Sunderland 2\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Dan Ballard\n\nArsenal: Top of the Premier League, top of the Champions League, through to the League Cup final and still in the FA Cup.\n\nSunderland: Seventeenth on away form.\n\nThis will be tough and the likelihood is that we’ll lose this one, but where’s the fun in that?\n\nGo big or go home. Haway the lads!!\n\nLet’s keep this short: Sunderland were great and Burnley were bloody awful.\n\nWe got three goals, could’ve had six, and they didn’t register a shot on target at all.\n\nWhilst we wish relegation on no club, if they’re down, it’s one less spot we need to worry about — although that isn’t a very big concern any more. We’re looking up way more than down.\n\nThe next game can get us points towards the top eight and Europe, and after the next two we have a decent run where we can compete and win some good points for sure, so if we get very little in North London, that’s OK.\n\nBring those points home, lads — be that one or three.\n\nA couple of the lads called a draw due to the potential banana skin, but the rest all called a win.\n\nNobody went for 3-0, with Gair very unlucky to not get three points as the lads looked good for four or five but didn’t score any more.\n\nSo, no perfect four-pointers, but a smattering of single points across the table.\n\nNo points for first scorer either — whether we gave “first scorer” to Habib Diarra for his first (OG) or his second, nobody picked him.\n\nWe now have a three way tie between Gary, Malc and Will, after Gary got nothing but the chasing duo got a point each.\n\nBrett is hanging in close too, and only three points split fifth and seventh.\n\nGair is now only four points behind Martin, and doesn’t generally back similar outcomes to our Mackem down under, so that could be a battle to watch.\n\nJust a quick reminder of how we allocate points to our match-by-match predictions:\n\nCorrect outcome (but not correct score) = One point\n\nCorrect first Sunderland goalscorer = One point (no goalscorer is a valid call)\n\nPossible deductions for being lazy and not submitting on time = a two-point deduction.",

    "fullText": "Man misidentified by London supermarket using Facewatch system says: ‘I shouldn’t have to prove I am not a criminal’\n\nA man was ordered to leave a supermarket in London after staff misidentified him using controversial new facial recognition technology.\n\nWarren Rajah was told to abandon his shopping and leave the local store he has been using for a number of years after an “Orwellian” error in a Sainsbury’s in Elephant and Castle, London.\n\nHe said supermarket staff were unable to explain why he was being told to leave, and would only direct him to a QR code leading to the website of the firm Facewatch, which the retailer has hired to run facial recognition in some of its stores. He said when he contacted Facewatch, he was told to send in a picture of himself and a photograph of his passport before the firm confirmed it had no record of him on its database.\n\n“One of the reasons I was angry was because I shouldn’t have to prove I am innocent,” Rajah said. “I shouldn’t have to prove I’m wrongly identified as a criminal.” He described the incident as feeling “quite like Minority Report, Orwellian”.\n\nHe said while doing his normal shop, he was approached by three members of the store’s staff, one of whom appeared to affirm that he was the person pictured on a device they had. It is understood the Facewatch system flagged someone else who had entered the store, and staff mistook Rajah for him.\n\nRajah was concerned some form of permanent record implying he had been involved in criminality might have been created on Facewatch’s system. Eventually, the firm told him he was not on its database and referred him back to Sainsbury’s.\n\n“You felt quite helpless in the situation because you’re just thrown from pillar to post – because Sainsbury’s initially blame Facewatch, then Facewatch retort saying it’s actually Sainsbury’s,” he said. “And then, when Sainsbury’s called me on Wednesday from the executive office, they blamed the store staff. So they’re constantly shifting the blame as to who’s responsible for this.”\n\nRajah was upset that he felt he had had to prove his innocence – and said he had received little assurance about how the information he had to hand over to Facewatch was stored, and whether it had been deleted.\n\nAnd he said that, while he was lucky enough to be able to navigate the system, “what happens to the vulnerable people who, for example, have learning disabilities or don’t know how to scan a QR code? They haven’t put any processes or procedures in place for anybody to challenge this. You should not be expected to send your personal information – that is totally unacceptable.”\n\nSainsbury’s said: “We have been in contact with Mr Rajah to sincerely apologise for his experience in our Elephant and Castle store. This was not an issue with the facial recognition technology in use but a case of the wrong person being approached in store.”\n\nFacewatch said: “We’re sorry to hear about Mr Rajah’s experience and understand why it would have been upsetting. This incident arose from a case of human error in store, where a member of staff approached the wrong customer.\n\n“Our data protection team followed the usual process to confirm his identity and verified that he was not on our database and had not been subject to any alerts generated by Facewatch.”",

He was charged with 11 felony counts of criminal damage to property for alleged incidents that took place on Dec. 5 and Dec. 6 at a UGA residence hall.\n\nSeymour's attorney, Kim Stephens, told the Athens Banner-Herald that Seymour was taking part in a “door kick challenge.\" The viral escapade that is similar to ding dong ditching, but involves kicking a door instead of ringing a doorbell.\n\nNews of Seymour's arrest emerged Wednesday night via multiple outlets reporting an erroneous number of charges despite the Athens-Clarke County jail site listing 11 charges on his booking profile.\n\nStephens told the paper that University of Georgia police “took 11 warrants in a case that they could have and should have taken a single warrant. … I expect Mr. Seymour’s case will likely be dismissed upon completion of a Pretrial Diversion Program that would include paying for any damage to property.”\n\nThe Georgia athletic department has declined to comment about Seymour’s arrest.\n\nThe freshman is a walk-on from Suwanee, Georgia. He appeared in one game in 2025 as he played in the team’s season-opening win over Marshall.",

    "fullText": "‘Mid-career’ female workers also being sidelined by rigid hiring processes, says City of London Corporation\n\nWomen working in tech and financial services are at greater risk of losing their jobs to increased use of AI and automation than their male peers, according to a report that found experienced females were also being sidelined as a result of “rigid hiring processes”.\n\n“Mid-career” women – with at least five years’ experience – are being overlooked for digital roles in the tech and financial and professional services sectors, where they are traditionally underrepresented, according to the report by the City of London Corporation.\n\nThe governing body that runs the capital’s Square Mile found female applicants were discriminated against by rigid, and sometimes automated, screening of their CVs, which did not take into account career gaps related to caring for children or relatives, or only narrowly considered their professional experience.\n\nTo reverse the trend, the corporation is calling on employers to focus on re-skilling female workers not currently in technical roles, particularly those in clerical positions most at risk of being displaced by automation.\n\nIt is estimated that about 119,000 clerical roles in tech and the financial and professional service sectors, predominantly carried out by women, will be displaced by automation over the next decade. Reskilling those affected by these job losses could save companies from making redundancy payments totalling as much as £757m, the report found.\n\nUpskilling staff would allow employers to focus on candidates’ potential rather than their past technical experience, the report found. It is estimated that up to 60,000 women in tech leave their roles each year for reasons including lack of advancement, lack of recognition and inadequate pay.\n\nDame Susan Langley, the mayor of City of London, said: “By investing in people and supporting the development of digital skills within the workforce, employers can unlock enormous potential and build stronger, more resilient teams. Focusing on talent, adaptability and opportunity will ensure the UK continues to lead on innovation and remains a global hub for digital excellence.”\n\nRecent surveys have shown that as many as a quarter of UK workers are worried that their jobs could disappear in the next five years because of AI, according to a poll by the international recruitment company Randstad. Union leaders have called on companies to commit to investing in workforce skills and training.\n\nThe City of London Corporation found that women were being overlooked for roles even as difficulties in hiring talent meant more than 12,000 digital vacancies in these sectors went unfilled in 2024.\n\nCompanies have tried to deal with worker shortages by increasing wages above the national average, but the report found that higher pay rates would not solve the problem. It warned that the widening digital talent gap was forecast to last until at least 2035 and that under this scenario the UK could miss out on more than £10bn of economic growth.",

But as of now there’s no guarantee the winner of Evloev vs. Murphy will get the next shot at Volk.\n\nLerone Murphy discussed the situation with Ariel Helwani, revealing there was no title shot guarantee that came with the main event booking.\n\n“Eeeeh, at this point, words are wind, innit?” Murphy said. “The division is forever changing. It’s a performance-based company, someone’s got to go out there and put on a good fight and then? Nothing’s concrete. But I hope so.”\n\nThe UFC has been hyper-focused on excitement as a metric for earning title shots, and Murphy suggested it would be hard to earn an exciting win off an opponent like Movsar Evloev.\n\n“I believe the matchmakers know what kind of match this is,” he said. “I think it would be unfair to say you’ve got to go out there and get a crazy knockout to get a title shot. Everybody knows what kind of fight this is going to be and what type of fighter I’m fighting against. So I think the winner should be undeniably next in line for the title. Simple.”\n\nIf there’s one person out there banging the drum for Movsar or Lerone to get a shot, it’s Alexander Volkanovski himself. If excitement and popularity is the metric, then it would be easy for UFC to slot No. 6 ranked Jean Silva into a title fight. But “The Great” is clearly unenthused about that fight.\n\n“You’ve got Silva obviously probably trying to get his name out there,” Volkanovski said in a new interview. “Now he’s saying some stuff and thinking he really deserves next. If the UFC obviously were to push that for me, everyone knows me. I’ll fight anyone. But I don’t think that’s very likely to happen.”\n\n“I don’t think he’s in a position to fight for the title, especially when you’ve got Lerone Murphy and Movsar Evloev fighting very, very soon. I think that’s very clear.”\n\nOnly if you’re looking at things in terms of win streaks and rankings and not social media popularity and action. The winner of Murphy vs. Evloev may leave London with a ten fight win streak compared to Silva’s one. But Silva surfed on his opponent’s back at the end of his last fight, which we must admit was pretty cool.\n\nCool enough to earn a title shot? In today’s UFC, maybe.",

    "description": "Murphy and Evloev will clash in the main event, but will the winner be next for featherweight king Alexander Volkanovski?",
    "fullText": "Lerone Murphy has admitted that his UFC London main event against Movsar Evloev may not be a No 1 contender’s fight, despite theories from many figures in MMA.\n\nOn 21 March, Manchester’s Murphy will face the Russian in a battle of unbeaten featherweights, with champion Alexander Volkanovski keen to face the winner.\n\nNaturally, then, many fans and pundits have been quick to dub the UFC London main event a No 1 contender’s bout, given Murphy and Evloev’s impressive records and Volkanovski’s desire to face either man.\n\nYet it isn’t always that simple in the UFC, as Murphy noted on Monday, shortly after his fight was announced. “Nothing’s concrete,” he said on The Ariel Helwani Show.\n\nStill, Murphy added: “But I hope so. The matchmakers know what type of match-up this is. Everyone knows what type of fight this is going to be, and what type of fighter I’m fighting against.\n\n“So, I think the winner should be undeniably next in line for the title. Simple.”\n\nMurphy, who will carry a 17-0-1 record into the O2 Arena, said of the 19-0 Evloev: “Movsar is elite. He’s a very good fighter, good everywhere, but I just believe I’m going to take him into deep waters.\n\n“It’s going to be defensive wrestling, an ambitious offence, and pressure him to make a mistake. I’ll be hunting for the knockout from bell to bell.”\n\nNews of the match-up came just two days after Volkanovski extended his second reign as featherweight champion with a win over Diego Lopes. Volkanovski outpointed Lopes to retain the title in the main event of UFC 325, nine months after beating the Brazilian in the same manner to win the vacant belt.\n\nAnd the Australian champion used his post-fight press conference to call for a fight with Murphy, 34, or Evloev, 31, next.\n\n“It hurt watching that fight, thinking I should have been there,” Murphy said. “It should have been me [...] I think if I was in there, I would have gotten the job done.\n\n“I see a lot of things in there that I would have been doing. I feel, right now, that I’m the best in the world at featherweight.\n\n“Volk is the guy I have the utmost respect for as a champion. If it were up to him, he would have fought me, and he’s going out there and fighting the next best. It’s how every champion should be. Hopefully I get the chance to share the Octagon with him.”\n\nMurphy last fought in August, taking on UFC debutant Aaron Pico. The Briton stopped the former Bellator star in stunning fashion, with a spinning back elbow, which led Volkanovski to call for a title defence against Murphy.\n\nMeanwhile, Evloev has not fought since December 2024, when he narrowly outpointed Aljamain Sterling, a former bantamweight champion in the UFC.",

    "fullText": "The much-discussed meeting between undefeated featherweights Movsar Evloev and Lerone Murphy is official to headline UFC London on March 21 at the O2 Arena in London, England.\n\nEvloev and Murphy are widely considered to be the two top contenders in the UFC's 145-pound division. Both men were expected to be in the running to challenge UFC champion Alexander Volkanovski. However, that role was ultimately given to Diego Lopes for the second time in nine months at UFC 325 — a decision met by significant controversy.\n\nVolkanovski dispatched Lopes with another one-sided decision this past Saturday in Sydney, Australia, then advocated for one of either Evloev or Murphy to be his next challenger. As such, it's very likely that the winner of UFC London's main event will move on to challenge Volkanovski in the summer.\n\nEvloev (19-0) is a perfect 9-0 under the UFC umbrella, but his rise has been slowed by long stretches of inactivity. The 31-year-old Russian has been sidelined since a December 2024 win over former featherweight champion Aljamain Sterling. He also holds notable victories over Lopes and Arnold Allen.\n\nMurphy (17-0-1) is also 9-0-1 inside the UFC, a run culminating with a highlight-reel spinning back elbow knockout of Aaron Pico this past August that captured Uncrowned's Knockout of the Year award. Included among Murphy's undefeated run are wins over veteran contenders Josh Emmett, Dan Ige and Edson Barboza.\n\nThe official UFC London fight card can be seen below.\n\nFeatherweight: Movsar Evloev vs. Lerone Murphy\n\nFeatherweight: Luke Riley vs. Michael Aswell.\n\nWelterweight: Michael Page vs. Sam Patterson\n\nLight heavyweight: Iwo Baraniewski vs. Austen Lane\n\nMiddleweight: Roman Dolidze vs. Christian Leroy Duncan\n\nFeatherweight: Danny Silva vs. Kurtis Campbell\n\nLightweight: Mason Jones vs. Axel Sola\n\nFeatherweight: Nathaniel Wood vs. Losene Keita\n\nHeavyweight: Louie Sutherland vs. Brando Pericic\n\nMiddleweight: Mantas Kondratavicius vs. Antonio Trocoli\n\nHeavyweight: Mick Parkin vs. Mario Pinto\n\nLightweight: Shem Rock vs. Abdul-Kareem Al-Sewady\n\nStrawweight: Shanelle Dyer vs. Ravena Oliveira",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG/BEIJING, Jan 30 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's visit to China is the latest win Beijing can tout in its rivalry with Washington, but the deals he brings back to London also show the limits of the balancing act that middle powers may try to play.\n\nHe follows Canadian counterpart Mark ​Carney, who struck a trade deal on a similar visit weeks ago, before heading to Davos to herald a new global trade order as U.S. President Donald Trump disrupts long-standing ties with ‌allies.\n\nEuropean leaders have also visited, as have India's Narendra Modi and others since Trump began his second term a year ago, but it is less clear what tangible long-term economic and security benefits such visits yield for Western powers.\n\n\"Traditional U.S. allies feel hard done ‌by and are now hedging their bets, but they are far from being able or willing to substitute China for the United States,\" said John Quelch, an expert in global strategy at Duke Kunshan University.\n\nFrom the perspective of London, Ottawa and other Western capitals, the visits demonstrate to Trump that alternatives exist if he keeps up pressure on issues from Greenland to renegotiating the USMCA trade deal among the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nBut these are \"superficial gestures amid stalled global growth,\" said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis.\n\n\"These visits highlight the severe limits of any 'pivot' to China,\" she said. \"They expose middle powers' vulnerability, chasing scraps while China's export flood overwhelms their industries.\"\n\nAnd they ⁠benefit Beijing, by supporting the narrative of a broad pivot to China ‌as the world's \"reliable partner\", in contrast with Trump's chaotic tariff policies and his growing list of threats and demands towards partners and rivals alike.\n\n\"President Trump’s efforts to decouple the United States from China are also decoupling the United States from the world,\" Quelch added.\n\nSTARMER SCORES WINS ON VISAS, WHISKY\n\nThe deals clinched by Western powers on such ‍visits come in return for deeper integration with a country that ran a trade surplus the size of the Dutch economy last year but where consumption is too weak for even its own producers to prosper at home.\n\nOn his trip to the world's second largest economy, Starmer secured 30-day visa-free access for Britons travelling to China and lower tariffs on whisky, while British drugmaker AstraZeneca unveiled a $15 billion investment in China.\n\nHe got nothing beyond \"frank dialogue\" on tension arising from China's ​increasingly assertive stance on Taiwan, its stronger ties with Russia after the Ukraine invasion and a rights crackdown on Britain's former colony of Hong Kong.\n\nBritish and U.S. politicians who criticised Starmer's trip also aired accusations ‌of espionage and human rights abuse, which Beijing denies.\n\nSimilarly, Carney left China with expectations that Beijing will cut or drop tariffs on canola, lobsters, crabs and peas, but that triggered threats of 100% tariffs from Trump, who warned Ottawa about allowing Chinese EVs into North America.\n\nAnd even before Starmer has wrapped up his China visit, Trump warned Britain it was dangerous to get into business with Beijing, after the prime minister extolled the economic benefits of resetting relations with China.\n\nCHINA'S EXPORT-DRIVEN GROWTH POSES RISKS FOR WEST\n\nChina's imports last year were flat at $2.6 trillion, but they were largely driven by energy and commodities from emerging markets, rather than the West.\n\nIts trade surplus, however, jumped a fifth, to a record $1.2 trillion, as its manufacturers responded to Trump's tariff measures by muscling into virtually every other market in the world, at the expense of domestic producers.\n\nSuch a ⁠pace of growth puts China's trade surplus on track to roughly reach the size of the $3-trillion French economy by 2030 and ​the $5-trillion German economy by 2033.\n\nIts exports to the European Union last year jumped 8.4%, while imports dipped 0.4%. China shipped 7.8% ​more to Britain, while buying 4.7% less. With Canada, sales grew 3.2% while purchases plunged 10.4%.\n\n\"This makes it an especially risky proposition for countries trying to protect or grow their own manufacturing industries to substantially increase trade integration with China,\" said Eswar Prasad, a former China director at the International Monetary Fund.\n\n\"China hardly provides a safe harbour for ‍countries trying to cope with the adverse economic effects ⁠of U.S. tariffs,\" added Prasad, who now teaches trade policy at Cornell University.\n\nStill, say some analysts, significant trade wins with China may not be as important - or even realistic - for countries such as Britain or Canada right now.\n\nResetting ties may be the best they can get, but that could still be valuable, as previous deterioration in relations exposed critical supply chain dependencies on China.\n\nThe Asian ⁠giant's trade countermeasures helped to widen two-way trade imbalances, rather than narrow them, analysts said.\n\nThe visits by Starmer and Carney are \"a propaganda coup for Beijing,\" said Noah Barkin, Europe-China expert at the German Marshall Fund and Rhodium Group, while warning, \"This is not a ‌pivot to China. It is about reducing tension with Beijing.\"\n\nHe added, \"No country wants to be in open conflict with the two superpowers at the same time.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Liangping Gao ‌and Kevin Yao in Beijing and David Kirton in Shenzhen; Writing by Marius Zaharia; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)",

    "fullText": "In-person interactions break down barriers in east London, as AI startups also try to bridge communication divide\n\nWesley Hartwell raised his fists to the barista and shook them next to his ears. He then lowered his fists, extended his thumbs and little fingers, and moved them up and down by his chest, as though milking a cow. Finally, he laid the fingers of one hand flat on his chin and flexed his wrist forward.\n\nHartwell, who has no hearing problems, had just used BSL, British Sign Language, to order his morning latte with normal milk at the deaf-run Dialogue Cafe, based at the University of East London, and thanked Victor Olaniyan, the deaf barista.\n\n“I have to be honest: when this cafe first opened near my office, I avoided it because the whole idea made me anxious,” said Hartwell, a lecturer at the university. “But now I’m fascinated. Sign language is amazing. I’m thinking of taking a course so I can learn more.”\n\nWhat gave Hartwell the confidence to try BSL was the cafe’s touchscreen menu. Instead of just listing the coffees and cakes on sale, the menus show videos of their BSL translation.\n\nFor many deaf BSL users, this kind of direct access is crucial. BSL is a first language for tens of thousands of people in the UK.\n\nOlaniyan, who has worked at the cafe for five years and now does shifts alongside a degree in accounting and management at the University of Reading, seemed mildly amused by the reactions of hearing people to the video menu.\n\n“I was brought up by hearing people, so I have no problem in the hearing world,” he signed. “But hearing people often feel anxious communicating with us. If this technology helps them, that’s great, but I’m fine as I am.”\n\nIn the past two years, there has been an explosion of digital and AI-linked products aiming to bridge communication barriers between the deaf and hearing worlds, from signing avatars to large generative models that aspire to rival mainstream AI platforms.\n\nIndependent evaluations of many of these systems remain limited, however, and sign language researchers caution that current tools still struggle with linguistic nuance, regional variation and context, particularly in high-stakes settings such as healthcare and law.\n\nBut the ambitions are striking: the UK startup Silence Speaks has built an avatar-based system that converts text into BSL, claiming it can convey contextual meaning and emotional cues.\n\nThe British project SignGPT, backed by £8.45m in funding, is developing models to translate between BSL and English in both directions, while also building what it describes as the largest sign languages dataset in the world.\n\nSign languages AI research has also become increasingly collaborative and international: a new £3.5m UK-Japan research project is developing systems trained on natural deaf-to-deaf conversation data rather than interpreter recordings.\n\nMuch of this recent progress has come quickly. When Prof Bencie Woll, a co-investigator of the SignGPT project at University College London’s Deafness, Cognition and Language Research Centre, first entered the field of BSL research, communication beyond face-to-face interaction was extremely limited for deaf people.\n\n“The rest of the world was moving ahead with technology, but deaf people were often left behind,” she said. “What’s different now is the pace. In the last couple of years, the deaf community has benefited from an explosively powerful mix of possibilities.”\n\nHistorically, technology has not always been positive, Woll cautioned. “There has often been a fantasy, particularly among researchers who don’t understand sign languages, that it is a quick fix. That you take a sign language, turn it into written English – and you’ve made deaf people’s lives wonderful,” she said.\n\nThat assumption led to what Woll described as “really terrible technology”, including wearable translation suits, bulky gloves and head-mounted cameras designed to process signing.\n\n“All of these were doomed to failure,” she said, “because they were designed by people who did not understand sign languages and did not ask deaf people what they wanted, let alone work alongside deaf experts from the start. The community has been frustrated for years by the proliferation of bad solutions.”\n\nYet the need for solutions is real. About 70 million people worldwide are deaf or hard of hearing. In the UK, census data records about 151,000 BSL users. For roughly 25,000 of them, BSL is their primary language. It is a distinct, natural language with its own grammar and structure, not a signed version of English.\n\nFor this group, written and spoken English is often a second – or even a third language, following lip-reading, Sign Supported English or family-invented gestures.\n\nThis has practical consequences: subtitles and written text are not always adequate substitutes for direct BSL access. A large 2017 study of deaf children aged 10 to 11 found that reading ability was significantly below expected age levels for 48% of deaf children educated using spoken language only, and for 82% of those whose everyday language was a sign language.\n\nDr Lauren Ward has the unusual role of leading on AI technology for the deaf community at the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), advising government and industry.\n\n“The pace of change has been so fast that RNID has made the unusual decision to employ engineers,” she said. “The potential to help the deaf community is huge – but so is the potential to cause harm.”\n\nDeaf people have long been early adopters of technology: SMS messaging transformed communication in the 1990s. But Ward said the last two years had brought a new intensity of interest and concern. “It has suddenly moved from university labs into startups and commercial products,” she said.\n\nThis shift has been enabled by advances in machine learning and related technologies that finally make the processing of large-scale sign languages technically possible.\n\nIncreased research funding, improved datasets and greater involvement from deaf researchers have also quickened the pace, as has a wider acknowledgment of the longstanding gap between the access deaf people are legally entitled to and what is delivered in practice: reliable sign languages provision has been promised for decades but has all-too-often failed to materialise.\n\nThis combination of opportunity and risk makes the current moment a double-edged sword, Ward said.\n\n“It is incredibly exciting, and the next five years could bring real improvements,” she said. “But there is a danger that private companies respond by focusing on profit rather than working with the deaf community and being led by them.”\n\nDr Maartje De Meulder, a deaf scholar and consultant on sign languages AI, agreed the stakes were high.\n\n“At the moment, deaf people are largely excluded from vast amounts of online information, from educational videos to government websites,” she said. “No one is ever going to have the resources to translate the entire internet into sign languages, so even partial solutions could be transformative.”\n\nNeil Fox, a deaf research fellow at the University of Birmingham, agreed that if avatar translation reached sufficient quality, it could open up many online spaces currently closed to deaf users.\n\nBut all are highly cautious. Rebecca Mansell, the chief executive of the British Deaf Association, said this “has become a very lucrative area and too many projects involve deaf people only tokenistically”.\n\n“It is all happening very fast, and there is a real risk that solutions will be imposed on us,” she added.\n\nMansell also raised concerns about regulation and appropriate use. “An avatar might be fine for ordering something simple,” she said, “but what about a cancer diagnosis? In schools, a human interpreter is often the only friend a deaf child has.”\n\nDr Louise Hickman, from the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy and lead author of the report BSL Is Not For Sale, has worked in AI ethics for a decade.\n\n“Many companies claim they can solve these problems without understanding the linguistic and cultural complexity of BSL,” she said. “Current avatar systems still lack the nuance of human interpreters, which creates risks in medical and legal settings.”\n\nHickman also pointed to the limits of available data. “British Sign Language is not the same as Irish Sign Language or American Sign Language. There are regional dialects within England. This means the data available for training AI systems is extremely limited.”\n\nSo where, she asked, will appropriate training data come from?\n\n“The deaf community wants innovation,” she said, “but we want to slow this down so we can shape it and make sure it genuinely benefits us.”\n\nBack at the cafe, Hakan Elbir, its founder, saw little need for more complex tools than his static BSL video menu.\n\n“People talk a lot about innovation, but for most deaf people it is still theoretical,” he said. “What I wanted was a meaningful daily interaction for hearing people.”\n\n“Coffee is just the excuse,” he added. “I didn’t need complicated technology to break down barriers. I just needed people to interact openly.”\n\nWaiting for his latte at the counter, Hartwell quietly practised the sign for “flat white”, proving that it was this simple, human interaction – supported but not overshadowed by technology – that was drawing him back, one signed coffee order at a time.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING (AP) — U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in the Chinese financial center of Shanghai on Friday in his bid to boost business opportunities for British firms in the world's second-largest economy, just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump signaled a possible opposition to any deal between Beijing and London.\n\nWhy are foreign leaders increasing visits to Beijing?\n\nWhat agreement was reached on British lawmakers sanctions?\n\nWhat business opportunities is Starmer seeking in China?\n\nHow did Trump respond to UK-China negotiations?\n\nStarmer, the center-left Labour leader, has brought more than 50 business leaders on his trip to China, the first by a U.K. prime minister in eight years.\n\nStarmer suggested Trump’s criticism was aimed more at Canada than Britain. He added that Washington was aware in advance of his trip and its objectives and pointed out that Trump has said he plans to visit China this spring.\n\n“I don’t think it’s wise for the United Kingdom to stick its head in the sand,” Starmer told Sky News. “China is the second biggest economy in the world. Along with Hong Kong, it’s our third-biggest trading partner. And through this visit, we’ve opened up lots of opportunities for jobs and wealth creation.”\n\nStarmer started his trip in Beijing on Thursday, where he met with Chinese leaders including Xi Jinping. The two pledged to pursue a long-term and stable strategic partnership in what was seen as a sign of improving ties after several years of friction between the two countries.\n\nIn Washington, Trump suggested that he may oppose any deal between Beijing and London, and then pivoted to Canada, with which he has had a series of sharp exchanges since Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visited China earlier this month.\n\n“Well, it’s very dangerous for them to do that,” he said, when asked about Starmer’s visit and any U.K. trade talks with Beijing. “And it’s even more dangerous, I think, for Canada to get into business with China. Canada is not doing well. They’re doing very poorly.”\n\n“You can’t look at China as the answer,” he said.\n\nStarmer and Carney are among a series of foreign leaders to visit Beijing as their nations seek to improve ties with China. Many have seen their countries’ economies buffeted by Trump’s tariffs and are looking to expand other export markets.\n\nThe British prime minister said Xi agreed to remove a travel ban that had been imposed on several British lawmakers after the U.K.'s former center-right Conservative government joined the European Union, Canada and the U.S. in imposing sanctions on four Chinese officials over evidence of rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim people in the far western Xinjiang region.\n\n“This has been a cause of concern in Parliament and for parliamentarians for some time and that is why I raised it on this visit,\" Starmer told ITV News. “The response from the Chinese is that the restrictions no longer apply and President Xi has told me that that means that all parliamentarians are welcome to visit.”",

    "fullText": "MUMBAI, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Some of the world's biggest reinsurers, including Lloyd's of London, are seeking Indian regulatory approval to operate in a low-tax city set up in the prime minister's home state ​to try to rival other international financial hubs, two sources said.\n\nThe global companies, which also include South Korea’s Samsung Re, ‌Kenya Re and Spain’s Mapfre Re, will join more than a dozen global reinsurers from Europe, the Middle East and Asia that are turning to the new city to ‌gain access to India's $129.78 billion insurance market, estimated by the industry to be the tenth largest in the world.\n\nThe two sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the press, said the companies were expected to seek approval this year.\n\nEmail queries sent to Mapfre Re, Samsung Re and Kenya Re were not answered. A Lloyd’s of London spokesperson declined to comment. The companies' plans to ⁠set up operations in the Gujarat International Finance ‌Tec‑City, or GIFT City, have not been previously reported.\n\nThe city offers businesses favourable tax treatment, such as a 10-year tax holiday and exemption from capital gains.\n\nThe government has said it hopes it will rival Singapore and ‍Dubai as an international financial centre.\n\nIndia's reinsurance market is currently dominated by Swiss Re and Munich Re, as well as private firms and the government-owned GIC Re that is widely expected to grow after the government introduced reforms to deepen India's insurance penetration.\n\nSAUDI RE AND OTHERS HAVE RECEIVED APPROVAL\n\nA few large ​reinsurers have received approvals over the last year to begin operating in GIFT City. These include Saudi Re, Korean Re, Peak Re, ‌Kuwait Re, Abu Dhabi National Insurance and Kazakh‑based Eurasia Insurance Company JSC, according to regulatory officials and company statements.\n\nSaudi Re earlier this week opened its GIFT City branch, its second in Asia after Malaysia.\n\nKorean Re has said its expansion reflected its commitment to India’s high growth insurance sector, while Hong Kong‑based Peak Re, which received a licence in March 2025, said it plans to offer life and non-life insurance.\n\nAbout 14 global reinsurers operate from GIFT City, managing an annualised $700–800 million in premiums, public disclosures show.\n\nThe number of reinsurers is expected to increase ⁠to at least 20 by the end of March 2026, two regulatory officials ​said, declining to be identified as final approvals are pending.\n\nThey said the international reinsurers ​sought to offer products that are relatively underdeveloped in India, including surety bonds, parametric insurance, marine and shipping cover, cyber risk and health reinsurance.",

Even though Chelsea put up a strong fight late on, they have got work to do if they want to turn things around.\n\nAlejandro Garnacho scored twice after coming off the bench to keep Chelsea’s hopes alive, but the team clearly missed some creativity from the start.\n\nWhile Cole Palmer has not featured much under Rosenior due to injury, he showed what he can do by setting up two goals against Napoli in his return from the bench during a Champions League match.\n\nPalmer will be looking to make his mark if he returns to the line-up, especially with the spotlight on him and fellow England international Bukayo Saka.\n\nIt is a comparison that comes up often, and both have also been mentioned alongside Phil Foden in discussions about the top young talent in English football.\n\nWhen asked for his opinion, Chelsea great Eden Hazard did not hesitate to choose Palmer over Saka.\n\nThe former Belgium international also preferred Palmer when compared to Lamine Yamal, who has recently been shortlisted for the Ballon d’Or.\n\nPalmer equalled a club record in the Champions League with his two assists off the bench against Napoli. Nicolas Anelka is the only other Chelsea substitute to have achieved that.\n\nBoth of Palmer’s assists were finished by Joao Pedro, who later called him a ‘special’ player after the match.\n\nClub captain Reece James also spoke highly of Palmer, and it has become clear just how much his absence has been felt when he has not been available.\n\nLiam Rosenior may look to rest him against West Ham this weekend, keeping him fresh for their trip to the Emirates.",

    "fullText": "LONDON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Former Nigerian oil minister Diezani Alison-Madueke had no real influence over the awarding of lucrative government contracts and was merely a \"rubber stamp\" for official recommendations, her lawyer said on ​Thursday at her London corruption trial.\n\nAlison-Madueke, minister for petroleum resources between 2010 and 2015 under then-president Goodluck Jonathan, has pleaded not ‌guilty to five counts of accepting bribes and a charge of conspiracy to commit bribery.\n\nProsecutors say Alison-Madueke \"enjoyed a life of luxury\" in London, with oil and gas industry ‌figures having provided the use of high-end properties and given her lavish gifts to try and influence the awarding of lucrative contracts.\n\nBut her lawyer Jonathan Laidlaw told jurors at London's Southwark Crown Court that purchases were made on Alison-Madueke's behalf \"because Nigerian ministers are forbidden from having bank accounts abroad\".\n\nHe also said Alison-Madueke, 65, disputes the extent to which properties were provided for her use and the amounts of goods she received, but ⁠that \"all that was spent on her personally, in ‌one way or another, was reimbursed\".\n\nLaidlaw said personal expenses were repaid by Alison-Madueke in Nigeria and expenses relating to official business were \"reimbursed from government coffers\", meaning Alison-Madueke received no financial advantage.\n\n\"If there was any financial advantage, ‍it was to Nigeria, enabling the Minister for Petroleum Resources to undertake her ministerial business and ... there was, of course, nothing improper about it,\" he added.\n\nOTHER ALLEGED BRIBE PAYERS NOT CHARGED IN UK\n\nAlison-Madueke, who was also briefly president of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, is standing trial alongside her brother ​Doye Agama, 69, who has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery relating to his church.\n\nTheir co-defendant Olatimbo Ayinde, 54, ‌has pleaded not guilty to one count of bribing Alison-Madueke between 2012 and 2014 and one count of bribery of a foreign public official.\n\nThe trial, expected to conclude in April, is one of the most high-profile cases relating to alleged corruption in oil-rich Nigeria.\n\nProsecutors say that Nigerian businessman Kolawole Aluko spent more than 2 million pounds ($2.8 million) on items for Alison-Madueke at London department store Harrods alone.\n\nAlison-Madueke is also accused of taking bribes, including gifts and payment for her son's school fees, from prominent oil and gas industry figures.\n\nBut, Laidlaw told the jury, ⁠none of the others named in the charges against Alison-Madueke have been charged, ​nor had Britain sought to have them extradited to stand trial.\n\nMINISTER HAD NO REAL ​INFLUENCE, LAWYER SAYS\n\nLaidlaw said Alison-Madueke's role as minister meant she signed off on oil and gas contracts which were awarded by the Nigerian government.\n\nHe told the jury to ask whether Alison-Madueke had \"any ability to exercise influence upon ‍who would be awarded these contracts ⁠or ... was she effectively a rubber stamp, stamping the recommendations that her civil servants made\".\n\nAlison-Madueke's lawyer also acknowledged that Nigeria, which is one of the world's largest producers of oil and the largest in Africa, had long been blighted by corruption.\n\nHe said, ⁠however, that perception of government and business practices may be different in Britain compared to Nigeria.\n\n\"Things which may seem uncomfortable or extravagant to all of us sitting ‌here in Southwark, may well feel very different to 12 people sitting together in Nigeria,\" Laidlaw told the jury.",

    "fullText": "Fulham have reached an agreement with Manchester City to sign winger Oscar Bobb in a deal worth an initial £27 million.\n\nThe transfer represents a significant move for the west London club as they look to reshape their wide options ahead of the second half of the season.\n\nManchester City will retain a 20 per cent sell-on clause and matching rights should Fulham accept a future bid for the Norway international.\n\nBobb is expected to undergo a medical shortly, with the move likely to be completed in time for the weekend.\n\nFulham view the 22-year-old as a direct replacement for Adama Traore, who has departed Craven Cottage to join West Ham United.\n\nHis arrival also provides important depth amid uncertainty surrounding Harry Wilson, who is out of contract at the end of the campaign.\n\nMarco Silva has prioritised technical wide players comfortable operating on either flank, a profile Bobb fits closely.\n\nThe winger’s pathway at Manchester City narrowed considerably following further attacking reinforcements this month.\n\nThe £82.5 million arrivals of Marc Guehi and Antoine Semenyo increased competition across the forward and midfield lines.\n\nPep Guardiola already has an abundance of options in wide and attacking midfield roles, including Phil Foden, Bernardo Silva, Jeremy Doku and Savinho.\n\nAs a result, Bobb found regular minutes increasingly difficult to secure despite his versatility.\n\nHe has made 15 appearances in all competitions this season, starting only five Premier League matches.\n\nInjuries also disrupted his momentum, including a recent hamstring issue suffered in December.\n\nBobb previously endured a prolonged absence with a broken leg, limiting his involvement across much of last season.\n\nDespite those setbacks, he remains highly regarded for his close control, intelligence between the lines and ability to operate in tight spaces.\n\nHis most memorable contribution for Manchester City came in January 2024, when he scored a dramatic stoppage-time winner away at Newcastle United.\n\nOverall, Bobb made 47 senior appearances for City, scoring three goals during his time at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nThe sale forms part of a wider strategy by City to balance heavy recent spending through player departures.\n\nThey have raised funds in recent windows through exits including James McAtee, Kyle Walker and Ederson.\n\nFor Fulham, the deal represents both ambition and opportunity.\n\nBobb arrives with elite-level experience despite his age and should be afforded greater responsibility in a less crowded attacking unit.\n\nCompetition for minutes is expected, but regular football appears far more attainable.\n\nThe move offers a fresh platform for a player whose development stalled amid fierce competition at City.",

    "fullText": "Speaking on RMC Sport show, Rothen S’enflamme, the former Monaco player has revealed that Lille OSC are interested in signing Mathys Tel (19) on loan from Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nHowever, the Spurs head coach is reluctant to see any players leave North London before the end of the transfer window, making a potential move for the former Bayern Munich forward difficult for the Ligue 1 club.\n\nThe French attacker has been struggling for minutes at the Premier League club. Despite making 16 appearances in the Premier League this season, most of these appearances have been from the bench. Tel has only amassed 639 minutes of playing time in the English first division this season.\n\nLille are not the only club to show an interest in the France youth international forward. Paris FC have also shown an interest in signing him on loan. Nevertheless, with Frank reluctant to see players depart before the window closes, a move looks unlikely.",

    "fullText": "A Minnesota woman’s family is speaking out after she died while asleep on her mother’s shoulder during an international flight from the U.S. to the U.K.\n\nRachel Green, a 44-year-old attorney and writer, died on a Delta Air Lines flight from Minneapolis to London on April 30, 2025, according to a GoFundMe started by her family.\n\nNow, investigators in the U.K. have revealed what likely caused her death.\n\nThe West London Coroner’s Court recently heard that Green’s death was likely the result of an undiagnosed heart condition in combination with prescription medications, according to The Irish Sun.\n\nDr. Alan Bates, a pathologist, said he found multiple substances in her blood, including melatonin, antidepressants and a small amount of alcohol, the outlet reports.\n\nBates also said he found evidence of myocardial tunneling, a condition in which an artery travels through the heart muscle, rather than on its surface, according to The Irish Sun.\n\nSenior Coroner Lydia Brown reportedly said Green had taken a “range of complex medications,” but there was “no evidence she was taking any in excess.”\n\n“She also had a congenital heart condition. This contributed to her death, along with the medications,” Brown said.\n\nGreen’s sister, Roxanne Carney, said she had an “abnormal” heart test that wasn’t investigated further, according to The Irish Sun. Now, she’s questioning why her sister “was never referred to a cardiologist before being prescribed this combination.”\n\n“Why was she on this regimen? Why are they prescribing this combination of medications?” Carney reportedly said.\n\nShe added: “If you can see all the records, ethically, how can you do this?”\n\nSenior Coroner Lydia Brown said in court that it is typically “reviewed” in the U.K., but that “the entirety of your population doesn’t seem to have that.”\n\n“[It is] unusual to find so many different [drugs]. Matters are done very differently in the U.S.,” Brown reportedly said.\n\nGreen was traveling to London to complete research for an upcoming historical fiction work on Eleanor of Aquitaine, an influential medieval queen, her family said on the GoFundMe page. She was described as a “brilliant writer” who had a keen love of theatre.\n\n“Rachel was beyond selfless, always taking care of everyone around her and trying to guide people to the goodness in life, be it traveling, enjoying a play, or a gathering,” her family wrote.\n\nGreen had also just recovered from an “unexpected illness” that forced her to relocate to her hometown in Minnesota and relearn how to walk.\n\n“She exuded unyielding strength and courage at even the most difficult times,” the GoFundMe page reads.\n\nThe Independent has contacted Carney and Delta Air Lines for comment.",

    "fullText": "Synthesia makes digital presenters for clients to use in corporate videos and counts 70% of FTSE 100 as customers\n\nA British AI startup that makes realistic video avatars has almost doubled its valuation to $4bn (£3bn), in a boost for the UK technology sector.\n\nSynthesia was valued at $2.1bn last year and moved into new offices in central London, marking the moment with a ceremony attended by the Sadiq Khan, the city’s mayor, and Peter Kyle, then technology secretary.\n\nOn Monday, it announced its latest funding round, led by an existing investor, Google Ventures, had raised $200m and valued the British company at $4bn. Google Ventures is the search firm’s venture capital arm.\n\nSynthesia uses human actors to generate digital avatars of people and also offers employers the ability to create replicas of their staff. Those avatars are then deployed by organisations in corporate videos in a range of scenarios such as health and safety in the workplace, advising on cybersecurity and how to communicate better at work.\n\nThe company counts 70% of the FTSE 100 as clients, including NatWest, Lloyds Bank and British Gas. It is also used by non-corporate bodies including the NHS, the European Commission and the United Nations.\n\nThe startup is also developing new avatars that will help train employees and give them new skills, through scenarios such as role-playing and giving tailored explanations.\n\nSynthesia’s co-founder, Steffen Tjerrild, said the increased valuation reflected the commitment of the company’s longstanding backers rather than the investment hype surrounding the AI sector. “Existing investors have seen the progress, have seen the numbers, have seen them compound year over year,” he said. “That is also telling a story that this is less [a case of] external investors trying to kind of hype it up, but more about validation from existing investors as well.”\n\nLast year, a leading British tech investor, James Anderson, said he found sharp increases in valuations of AI startups such as OpenAI and Anthropic “disconcerting”. Tjerrild said Synthesia was focusing on executing its business plan, which, he added, was backed by investors who were long-term supporters.\n\n“This round is led by insiders, or predominantly existing investors that deeply understand the business, have seen the execution and the improvement of the business over many years,” he said.\n\nSynthesia generated revenues of $58.3m in 2024 but made a pre-tax loss of $59.2m, according to its latest published accounts, which the company said reflected its investment in headcount, its technology and new offices. Synthesia said it was on track to make $200m in revenues this year.\n\nThe $4bn valuation puts the company on a par with UK broadcaster ITV, which is worth £3.1bn. Tjerrild’s shareholding in Synthesia is now worth $160m, the same as its chief executive and fellow co-founder, Victor Riparbelli.\n\nSynthesia was founded in 2017 by the two Danish nationals, as well as the computer scientists Matthias Niessner and Lourdes Agapito.\n\nLast year, the London mayor said Synthesia was doing “incredibly well” as he opened its new offices. However, in a speech this month Khan said AI would “usher in a new era of mass unemployment” if used recklessly, as intelligent, autonomous systems proved cheap replacements for humans.\n\nTjerrild said he believed AI would enable businesses to hire more staff. “We’re an AI-first company, we have 600 employees and we hired 40% more people last year,” he said. “As a business owner myself, if my employees become more productive that means I can invest and hire more people.",

He loved where he lived; he would get up and go for [a] run around Hyde Park in the mornings. He loved walking in the local area, but he also really, really enjoyed jumping in a helicopter at Battersea Heliport and flying off into the quintessentially British countryside.\"\n\nThe source continued, \"It all happened very quickly; it was a surprise to the staff at the building where his penthouse is. It's most strange. The UK became both his professional headquarters and private playground, with discrete dates, tightly-guarded movements, and late-night arrivals.\"\n\n\"England became far more than just a filming base,\" they added about Cruise's sudden exit.\n\nBefore Cruise's decision to seemingly return to the US, he had become very well known for his love of the UK, where he had been making films for over 40 years.\n\nLast year, the actor was recognized for his contribution to the UK film industry and was awarded a BFI fellowship by the British Film Institute.\n\nAt the event held in May, Cruise noted, \"I'm truly honoured, I've been making films in the UK for over 40 years and have no plans to stop.\"\n\nBack in 2022, the actor also labeled himself an \"Anglophile\" because he spent a lot of \"time in Britain, and that's not just for work reasons.\"\n\n\"I just love being here,\" he stated at the time, per the Daily Mail. \"It's a fantastic blend of old and new... Britain is trendy, too, and has a lot that other countries then copy. I also love the British countryside.\"\n\nCruise was also said to have been interested in buying some properties in the Cotswolds, as he hoped to strengthen his ties to the UK, making his sudden departure, which reportedly included him removing his blackout curtains from his penthouse, even more puzzling.\n\nCruise, who has somewhat become the face of the Church of Scientology because of his vocal support over the years, recently came under fire after locals made complaints about him and his organization.\n\nThe actor makes it a point of duty to attend the Church's annual fundraiser in England. However, last year's edition in December allegedly \"angered\" residents of East Grinstead because of the disruption it brought to their everyday lives.\n\nThe small town located in West Sussex is home to the British headquarters of the Church and often receives guests in large numbers when such events are happening.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, former Scientologist Alexander Barnes-Ross said that the locals are \"extremely frustrated and angered\" by the instant increase in population during the fundraiser, and were particularly uncomfortable with the disturbance caused by Cruise \"flying in on his helicopter.\"\n\n\"It causes a lot of noise and nuisance, and he [Tom Cruise], you know, doesn't stop for photos or anything,\" Barnes-Ross shared.\n\nAccording to the news outlet, a resident described the Church's order of proceedings right from the preparation stages as \"very disruptive.\"\n\n\"For six to eight weeks, they were laying down pallets in the field to make a car park, so we had the disruption and noise of that, with lorry after lorry coming,\" the unidentified local said of Cruise's Church.\n\nDuring the event proper, more of such chaos would follow as the Church uses generators to power heavy equipment and also plays loud musical instruments.\n\nReports suggest the community feels \"helpless\" as to what they'll do, as some town leaders also attend the Church and have a good relationship with the organization.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, locals have since filed a complaint with the Mid Sussex District Council, noting that the event attended by Cruise and other high-profile church members causes \"considerable disruptions\" to the area.\n\nIt allegedly brings about traffic congestion and noise pollution. The complaint would see the Church's premises license undergo a review.\n\nIf the local community wins, the Church could be asked to tone down the large scale of events it organizes or implement measures to protect vulnerable people.",

    "fullText": "LONDON/WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. control of Venezuela's oil exports has ensnared barrels that had been servicing debt to China, lining up another potential showdown between the two superpowers that could further complicate the South American country's path out of default.\n\nAround a tenth of Venezuela's $150 billion foreign debt pile is estimated to be loans from China that ​the OPEC member was paying in oil cargoes - until the U.S. seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro earlier this month.\n\nDebt experts said the ramifications of China's claim on the cargoes and any clash with ‌the United States could make it tougher for Venezuela to restructure its debt after a 2017 default and put at risk Beijing's cooperation in restructuring deals for other developing nations.\n\n\"Even under the best circumstances, this was going to be very messy - trying to disentangle where all ‌these creditors stand in the credit hierarchy,\" said Christopher Hodge, chief economist with Natixis and a former U.S. Treasury official.\n\n\"The fact that now America is controlling all the finances into and out of the country...this seems to be unprecedented to me, that we're going to have such entanglements, such opacity about the finances of a government,\" Hodge said.\n\nWhile Washington currently controls only oil sale proceeds, Hodge noted that these are Venezuela's main source of revenue.\n\nDocuments and sources from state-run oil firm PDVSA show three supertankers have been shuttling between Venezuela and China over the last five years carrying oil for interest payments under the terms of a temporary deal struck in 2019. But these shipments are only ⁠a fraction of Venezuela's total crude exports to China.\n\nAidData, a research lab at ‌the U.S. university William & Mary that tracks lending, said some cash proceeds from oil sent to China went into an account controlled by Beijing and on to service the debt - even as sanctions and default blocked payments to many of Venezuela's other creditors.\n\nThe Trump administration has now said that proceeds from the sale of Venezuela's oil will go into ‍a Qatar-based account controlled by Washington, potentially giving the U.S. President himself substantial leverage over which creditors get paid, and when.\n\nIn response to a request for comment on the cargoes and debt payments, China's foreign ministry said Beijing \"has repeatedly stated its position\".\n\nBeijing condemned the redirection of Venezuelan oil exports during a January 7 news conference, adding \"legitimate rights and interests of China and other countries in Venezuela must be protected\".\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Reuters that Trump had brokered an oil deal with Venezuela ​that \"will benefit the American and Venezuelan people\".\n\nThe Trump administration is allowing China to purchase Venezuelan oil but not at the \"unfair, undercut\" prices at which Caracas sold the crude previously, a U.S. official said on Thursday.\n\nTraders managing Venezuelan oil ‌sales have offered some to Chinese refiners, but these are private market transactions, not intended as debt payments.\n\n\"The people of Venezuela will collect a fair price for their oil from China and other nations,\" the U.S. official said.\n\nThe Venezuelan communications ministry, which handles all press inquiries for the government, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nTrump could yet make a deal with China. However, the planned U.S. takeover of Venezuela's oil sector and control of its revenue could upend the hierarchy of creditors, restructuring advisors warn.\n\n\"All of these things will have the practical effect of subordinating the claims of legacy debtholders,\" said global sovereign debt expert Lee Buchheit, adding it was unclear if Trump had the legal right to determine who gets paid first.\n\nSome $60 billion of Venezuela's bonds tipped into default in 2017, and a restructuring agreement is essential to enable it to borrow again and attract new ⁠investment.\n\nIn a typical restructuring, bilateral lenders come together and agree what losses they will accept, usually via the Paris Club of ​creditor nations. This sets the bar for the \"comparable\" losses private lenders - bond investors, banks and others - must take.\n\n\"Comparability of treatment will be ​a real challenge, particularly if the U.S. controls the use of oil revenues,\" said Mark Walker, a longtime sovereign debt advisor who previously worked on potential Venezuelan restructurings.\n\nIf the U.S. pushes China to swallow significant writedowns on its debt - and China digs its heels in - it could slow a restructuring and hinder Venezuela's economic recovery in the process.\n\nThat could ‍keep Venezuela \"in very dire straits during the foreseeable future\", said ⁠Jean-Charles Sambor, head of emerging market debt with TT International, which holds Venezuelan bonds. In turn, this would limit how much the country can afford to repay to bondholders and other creditors.\n\nChina has little immediate leverage. Countries typically do not take other nations to court or arbitration over lending claims, Walker said, and would need to settle the situation \"on a government-to-government basis\".\n\nBut ramifications are possible: China is the ⁠largest bilateral lender to the developing world and its cooperation with the Paris Club has been crucial over the past decade. Beijing agreed restructuring terms via a platform called the Common Framework during Ghana, Zambia and Ethiopia's debt restructuring talks.\n\n\"China's obvious leverage is to refuse ‌to cooperate in future Common Framework sovereign debt workouts until it feels that it has been treated fairly in Venezuela,\" Buchheit said. \"And that threat would have some force.\"",

    "title": "Starting XI: Xhaka Out? Diarra And Talbi Back? Is This Sunderland’s Team To Take On West Ham?",
    "description": "Is this how Sunderland will line up at the London Stadium today?",
    "fullText": "With Habib Diarra and Chemsdine Talbi back from AFCON, Sunderland have a full strength squad to choose from… or is that HAD a full strength squad to choose from? Last night, rumours were swirling around on social media that Granit Xhaka had an injury that would keep him out for a couple of months – although subsequent rumours suggested it wasn’t as serious as all that, and it was an injury he’d been playing with for the past few weeks. We know Xhaka’s travelled with the squad from the pictures the club posted online, so fingers crossed he’s fit and the rumours are a load of rubbish! On the basis of Xhaka being fit, here’s how I think we’ll line up today.\n\nRoefs made a couple of good saves early on against Palace to prevent us from going behind earlier than we did. He’ll have been a little disappointed he didn’t get more on the ball in the lead up to Palace’s goal, but he had another fine game overall – something we’ve come to expect now!\n\nIt was great to see Reinildo back in the team last week – he offers so much in every department and is a class act. Ballard and Alderete performed well too; indeed it was Ballard and Mukiele who were heavily involved in the build up to Le Fee’s goal on Saturday, and they were solid defensively, too. Unchanged at the back.\n\nTrai Hume will be in the team, and he’ll play in that hybrid right midfield / centre midfield / right back / centre back position that enables other people such as Ballard and Mukiele to spring forward, as we saw in the build up to Le Fee’s goal on Saturday. I’m hedging my bets and saying Xhaka will play, but if not I think it’ll be Geertruida who comes in as a straight swap. I reckon Diarra will be on the bench today as he is reintegrated back into the team, while Sadiki and Le Fee will stay in their usual positions – Le Bris hinted as much regarding Le Fee, so I don’t see any change there. The only question for me is who plays on the left. Romaine Mundle’s done ok in recent weeks but is still building his match fitness, and something just doesn’t seem right with Adingra, so we could see Talbi straight back in the team. The question here is his fitness – frustratingly he barely played at AFCON, so he could either be raring to go or in need of some training to get up to match sharpness. If it’s the former, I think he’ll be straight back in.\n\nBrobbey’s been superb recently and will be vitally important today as he looks to add to his goal tally so far. His fitness is spot on now and he’s holding the ball up brilliantly. Hopefully we can get the ball to him a bit more as he’s capable of scoring a decent amount of goals for us, given the chance.",

    "description": "From Rooney's Plymouth to Xhaka's European push - how far have we come in 12 months?",
    "fullText": "Ahead of Saturday and our return fixture against West Ham, I can’t help but cast my mind back to August 16th 2025. The Stadium of Light was absolutely pulsating and West Ham were the unfortunate souls tasked with welcoming us back to the Premier League. That 3-0 demolition job, with Eliezer Mayenda, Dan Ballard and Wilson Isidor writing their names into the season’s opening chapter, felt like somewhat of a fever dream.\n\nWith the power of retrospect, that win was not simply just the result of adrenaline but was, instead, a statement. It told other teams in this league that we’re not here to make up the numbers.\n\nAs we near the end of January, we’re right in the mix for the European places, sitting comfortably on 33 points.\n\nTwelve months ago, we were in the mire of the Championship, giving tactical mastermind Wayne Rooney and his soon-to-be-doomed Plymouth squad a generous point at our home ground.\n\nFast forward to today, and as we prepare for the return fixture at the Taxpayers’ Stadium on Saturday, the landscape has changed entirely. Had someone told me in that Plymouth game that we would not only be promoted but would then remain unbeaten at home during the first half of a Premier League season, I’d have called for a straitjacket.\n\nWhat Régis Le Bris, along with Kristian Speakman, our recruitment team and the players themselves, have done in half a season is nothing short of remarkable.\n\nFrom the home fixture against West Ham, I feel like we’re in an even stronger position as a team. Gone are the days of the slightly chaotic Championship side. Instead, in its place, is a disciplined, suffocating Premier League unit. Not only that, but the synergy between the players and fans is clear to see.\n\nWhen we fell behind against Crystal Palace, there was no sense of panic or dread. We knew that chances would come.\n\nHitting 33 points before February is truly incredible. It represents a springboard and reflects one of the most exciting periods to be supporting Sunderland AFC. For me, any fear of relegation has been replaced by the genuine, albeit mildly terrifying, prospect of a European tour. Twelve months ago, we were sweating over Championship play-off permutations…\n\nWe head into this weekend sitting in 9th place and only 3 points away from 4th. Saturday isn’t just about three points, though. It’s about doing the double over a struggling West Ham side and providing a clear sign of how far the pendulum has swung. With solid recruitment and relentlessly high expectations driven from Granit Xhaka, we’re demonstrating that we are not just a “plucky” promoted side. Under Régis Le Bris, we’ve found a level of tactical maturity that, frankly, should have taken years to cultivate. This isn’t the same Sunderland of the late 2010s, where we relied upon miracles and had to endure weekly rallying cries. Instead, it’s a tactically astute outfit that has spent the last five months proving every pundit wrong.\n\nThe journey from August 16th to where we are today is remarkable. If the opening day win was a statement, then the last five months have been the proof. I, for one, can’t wait to see where we end up in 12 months.",

    "fullText": "Derek Chisora will face former world heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder in London in April in his 50th career fight.\n\nChisora, 42, said last year he would retire after a 50th bout which would take place overseas.\n\nBut BBC Sport understands the Briton has instead chosen to take on Wilder in London on 4 April.\n\nThe pair were due to fight 13 years ago but Wilder withdrew from the bout after an arrest for domestic violence prevented him from travelling to the UK.\n\nWilder won his first 40 fights before drawing with Tyson Fury in 2018 - and then suffered successive defeats by the 'Gypsy King' in 2020 and 2021.\n\nChisora has also faced Fury three times - losing all three, in 2011, 2014 and 2022.\n\nWilder was once considered the division's most feared puncher but has struggled to regain his aura since his trilogy with Fury.\n\nThe 40-year-old's stock plummeted after back-to-back stoppage defeats by Joseph Parker in 2023 and Zhilei Zhang in 2024.\n\nAfter more than a year out, the American returned in June with a low-key seventh-round stoppage of little-known Tyrrell Anthony Herndon.\n\nYet despite his fall from grace, Wilder has still been heavily linked with a potential fight against unified champion Oleksandr Usyk - should he beat Chisora.\n\nChisora, meanwhile, is enjoying a late-career resurgence with a three-fight winning run, including points victories over Joe Joyce and Otto Wallin.\n\nHe had been linked with a third bout against long-time rival Dillian Whyte or a possible shot at WBO champion Fabio Wardley.\n\nFury has backed Chisora to win the fight and thinks it should be for a title.\n\nHe said: \"There should be a belt on the line. You've got two legendary fighters here.\n\n\"A world champion with 10 title defences from the USA, and an absolute warlord from the United Kingdom.\"",

    "fullText": "Dortmund took a large (and loud) away contingent to London for this midweek tie that would see the winner jump to the automatic qualification spots. Thomas Frank’s Spurs came into it on the back of five winless games, with stale displays seeing ever-increasing numbers of fans voice their discontent with his management. By contrast, we had only lost one in our last twelve and, while our own game wasn’t much to write home about, it was effective enough that one might reasonably expect us to win this one.\n\nUnfortunately, we started on the back foot and never quite got off it, as the hosts headed into the break two goals and a man up. Niko Kovac attempted to steady his obviously shaken troops, making two defensive changes at half time, and while Spurs looked far less threatening, our offensive play remained non-existent, with our first (and only) shot on target a Nico Schlotterbeck header in the 91st minute. A well-deserved loss, then, and a huge missed opportunity. Here are your match ratings.\n\nNot much he could’ve done about the two he conceded. Stood up well to Kolo Muani’s late chance.\n\nGets a point extra for his very obvious desire to keep going even after several of his teammates’ heads had dropped. Timing of the challenge was often poor.\n\nPossibly the only defender to leave this game without a serious blot on his copybook.\n\nReally struggled with the pacy Odobert after Svensson’s sending off, didn’t cover himself in glory today.\n\nI have no idea what he contributed.\n\nOne of the first players to lose steam after the second goal. Made several careless errors.\n\nStarted brightly, but looked increasingly lost as the game wore on.\n\nUnfortunately, can’t really have complaints about the red. It put us in an awful position, which Spurs really exploited.\n\nThe red card left him marooned on the left wing, chasing the shadows of quicker players without support.\n\nShould really have done better on the break in the first half, but I can’t fault him for his second 45; he had absolutely no support up there.\n\nDidn’t press, didn’t run, didn’t even look interested in trying to contribute.\n\nAdded some spine to the midfield.\n\nGets a six simply because of the insane work rate he demonstrated immediately after coming on. Was clearly up for it and I could imagine things being very different if he’d started up top. A must-start.\n\nSpurs were (unexpectedly) legitimately good today and good value for their win. We, by contrast, looked stunned from the get-go and never really got going, with Svensson’s red card effectively sealing our fate. Several poor individual performances were compounded by an apparent lack of belief post the red, making the rest of the game more or less a formality. It’s clear to me that, while a hard worker, Bellingham lacks the requisite nous for this level, and Couto cannot be relied upon to consistently perform. The final player I’m going to single out is Serhou Guirassy, who once again provided zero industry up front; I have no problem with a striker not scoring when he isn’t receiving service, but he really has to have a bit more grit about him and a much better first touch. Fabio Silva looked miles ahead when he came on.\n\nOverall, Kovac’s approach was typically pragmatic, but one has to wonder if things might’ve been different had he reacted better to the red. Shifting to a 4-4-1 resulted in Bensebaini going up against a winger he had no hope of catching and relegated Brandt to a spectator’s role, especially without the more active Silva to make things happen up top. It also put a whole lot of responsibility on the as-yet unready Bellingham and forced Adeyemi into an unnatural wide position. After the substitutions at half, the team was entirely rudderless going forward, as Adeyemi was tasked with making something out of absolutely nothing all on his own. Things improved marginally after Carney and Silva came on, but nowhere near enough for us to even dream of a point. Once, more I’m left wondering if Kovac has the ability to really inspire a team to rally against adversity; we seem more likely to lose from a winning position than win from a losing one, and that was on full display today.",

    "description": "A large multicentre clinical trial led by King’s College London with 150 children and adolescents has shown that a device cleared by the US FDA to treat ADHD is not effective in reducing symptoms.",
    "fullText": "A large multicentre clinical trial led by King’s College London with 150 children and adolescents has shown that a device cleared by the US FDA to treat ADHD is not effective in reducing symptoms.\n\nThe device – which uses an approach called trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) - was cleared for use by the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) to treat ADHD in 2019 based on a small study. These new findings from a larger multicentre trial, published in the journal Nature Medicine, suggest authorities should revisit the original evidence that supported the FDA clearance. Notably, TNS is currently not recommended for use in the UK by NICE guidelines.\n\nThe trial was run in collaboration with University of Southampton and funded by the Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation (EME) Programme, a partnership between the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) and the UKRI Medical Research Council (MRC), with further support from the NIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre.\n\nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects five to eight per cent of school-age children worldwide and is associated with age-inappropriate problems with attention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity that can impair everyday functioning. Stimulant medications improve symptoms in 70 per cent of those who take them in the short term but there is less evidence of their long-term effects.\n\nTo provide an alternative to medication researchers have developed and trialled approaches that use non-invasive stimulation of the brain, working on the regions that have been identified as influential in ADHD.\n\nOne of these approaches involves stimulating the trigeminal nerve (TNS), targeting a branch of this facial nerve which is thought to activate the brainstem and from there other brain regions that may be relevant to ADHD, in particular the locus coeruleus, which plays a role in arousal which is typically diminished in people with ADHD. TNS is thought to stimulate other brain regions associated with attention such as frontal and thalamic areas via the brainstem in a bottom-up manner.\n\nA previous small trial in the US with 62 children diagnosed with ADHD has shown that when TNS is applied every night for eight hours for one month it is effective in reducing symptoms – this research led to its clearance by the FDA for use in the US. However, the control condition involved no stimulation, and blinding was not tested after one month, raising questions about a potential placebo effect.\n\nThis new UK clinical trial across two sites in London and Southampton tested TNS in a wider range of 150 children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD aged between eight and 18 years old and applied a more rigorous placebo condition. Half of the sample received real TNS for about 9 hours every night for four weeks through battery-powered electrodes applied to the forehead. The other half of the sample received the ‘sham’ condition where electrodes were still applied to the forehead every night for four weeks but participants only received 30 seconds of stimulation every hour at a lower frequency and pulse width, which are thought to be non-effective and hence act as a “control” condition.\n\nOur study shows how important it is to design an appropriate placebo condition in clinical trials of brain therapies. There is a large placebo effect with high-tech brain therapies, in particular for patients and families that have an expectation that they can adjust brain differences associated with ADHD. It is hence paramount to control for placebo effects in modern brain therapies to avoid false hopes.\n\nDr Aldo Conti, postdoctoral researcher at IoPPN and at Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery & Palliative Care, King’s College London and first author on the study said: “This multicentre trial was designed to address key limitations of the previous pilot study that informed FDA clearance of TNS for ADHD, particularly by using a rigorously controlled sham condition that supported successful blinding across the treatment period. Unlike the earlier study, which was limited to younger children, we also included adolescents, a clinically important group given well-documented challenges with long-term medication adherence. These design choices enabled a more robust and clinically relevant evaluation of TNS.”\n\nThe trial showed that TNS was safe with no serious adverse events and most participants considered it a mild or no burden to use. However, the results showed no significant change in ADHD symptoms, objective measures of hyperactivity, attention and associated behaviours around mood and sleep.\n\nProfessor Samuele Cortese, NIHR Research Professor at University of Southampton and study lead for the Southampton site, stated: “Rigorous evidence, such as that generated by this study, is essential for supporting shared decision-making regarding interventions for ADHD. It empowers individuals with ADHD and their families to make informed choices about the treatment of ADHD. Clinicians, individuals with ADHD, and their families need to know which treatments work, and which do not based on the best evidence.”\n\nThe trial was run by the King’s Clinical Trials Unit and recruitment involved the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) clinics within the following NHS trusts: South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare (previously known as SOLENT NHS Trust), Central and North-West London NHS Foundation Trust, Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust and South-West London and St. George’s Mental Health NHS Trust.\n\nExternal trigeminal nerve stimulation in youth with ADHD: a randomized, sham-controlled, phase 2b trial by Conti, A.A. et al was published in Nature Medicine. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-04075-x\n\nProfessor of Cognitive Neuroscience\n\nPostdoctoral Research Associate",

It was a tricky decision, but one I felt was a really good opportunity for me that I didn't want to turn down.\"\n\nEngland host the T20 World Cup in June and July, and while home tournaments are often a stage for veteran players to bow out, Knight says the competition will not feature her last trip to the crease.\n\n\"I'm certainly committed to playing at the moment. One thing the last couple of years has taught me is it's not actually super beneficial to look too far ahead sometimes,\" she added.\n\n\"Something I've tried to do is live in the moment and really enjoy what I'm doing. There's bound to be questions around retirement and things like that.\n\n\"But while I'm still performing, enjoying my cricket and contributing to the team being successful, I want to carry on playing.\"",

    "title": "Lasses Review: Pride In Defeat As Sunderland’s FA Cup Journey Ends",
    "description": "Charlotte Patterson reports from Eppleton as Sunderland Women’s FA Cup campaign was curtailed by London City Lionesses",
    "fullText": "The Adobe Women’s FA Cup clash between Sunderland AFC Women and London City Lionesses at Eppleton Colliery Welfare Ground was always destined to be a stern test for the Lasses.\n\nWith London City arriving as one of the most possession-dominant and technically proficient sides in the competition, Sunderland knew they would need to adapt tactically to withstand the pressure, and adapt they did, shifting from their usual 4-2-3-1 formation to a more compact and defensively resilient 5-2-3 setup designed to absorb the Lionesses’ attacking waves and strike on the counter.\n\nFrom the opening whistle, the Lionesses asserted their dominance in possession, moving the ball with precision and intent.\n\nSunderland, however, weren’t passive observers and their five-player back line — marshalled superbly by Rhiannon Roberts, Hannah Greenwood and Brianna Westrup — held firm, maintaining shape and discipline. Jessica Brown and Louise Griffiths flanked the triple pairing, whilst Emily Scarr and Katie Kitching dropped deep to support defensively.\n\nGrace Moloney was largely untroubled in the opening forty five minutes. Aside from a dangerous cross that she punched clear with authority, she had little else to do — a testament to the defensive wall erected in front of her.\n\nThe Lionesses’ attempts to penetrate the final third were repeatedly thwarted, with Sunderland’s midfield duo of Natasha Fenton and Marissa Sheva working tirelessly to close passing lanes and disrupt rhythm.\n\nKitching, deployed on the wing rather than in her usual number ten role, showed tremendous work rate, tracking back and doubling up defensively when needed. Scarr mirrored that commitment on the opposite flank, never shirking her duties and often initiating the press when the Lionesses looked to build from the back.\n\nDespite the Lionesses’ territorial advantage, they were severely restricted in terms of clear-cut chances — Sunderland’s compact shape and aggressive pressing in key areas ensuring that shots on target were virtually non-existent in the first half.\n\nSunderland even had their own chances to take the lead when Eleanor Dale’s shot looked set to beat the keeper until a last-second block sent it over the bar. Fenton also went close when her shot ricocheted off the post as she aimed for the bottom corner after the set piece.\n\nThe deadlock was broken shortly after the interval.\n\nA moment of quality from the visitors saw Grace Geyoro slip the ball through to Wassa Sangaré, who timed her run perfectly and slotted past Moloney with composure. It was a cruel blow for Sunderland, who’d defended with such heart and organisation.\n\nHowever, the goal seemed to galvanise the Lasses and Sunderland began to grow into the game, pushing higher up the pitch and enjoying spells of possession. Fenton and Sheva started to find pockets of space, and Brown began to link play more effectively in midfield.\n\nSubstitutions followed as Sunderland looked to inject fresh energy and chase an equaliser.\n\nKaty Watson and Izzy Atkinson replaced Dale and Kitching in order to add some much-needed fresh legs, whilst Scarr moved into a forward position. London City responded with changes of their own, introducing their big guns in Danielle van de Donk, Saki Kumagai, Nikita Parris and Kosovare Asllani in order to regain control.\n\nDespite Sunderland’s increased intent, the visitors’ defence remained resolute.\n\nBalls into the box were swiftly dealt with, and Elene Lete was never truly tested. Sunderland’s best moments came from wide areas, with Kitching and Scarr continuing to drive forward, but the final ball lacked the precision needed to unlock the defence.\n\nSheva did have an opportunity int he dying moments of the game with a cross-shot, but it wasn’t enough to trouble the goalkeeper or to send the fans into frenzied celebrations.\n\nAs the referee blew for full time, the scoreline read 0-1 to London City Lionesses.\n\nOn paper, it was a narrow defeat; in reality, it had been a performance that spoke volumes about Sunderland’s character, determination, and tactical discipline.\n\nTo face such a technically gifted side and limit them to a single goal from a set piece was a remarkable achievement. The back line — led by Roberts and Westrup — was immense throughout, constantly organising, communicating and throwing bodies in front of shots, and Moloney’s calm presence behind them added further assurance.\n\nKitching and Scarr’s defensive contributions were vital, while Fenton and Sheva battled relentlessly in midfield. Though Sunderland didn’t manage to test Lete, their second half response showed bravery and ambition.\n\nThis tie will be remembered not for the scoreline, but for the spirit Sunderland showed. Against one of the strongest sides in the competition, they stood firm, adapted intelligently and fought for every ball. The tactical switch to a 5-2-3 was bold and effective, and the players executed it with discipline and heart.\n\nAlthough the journey ends here, the performance lays a foundation of belief as Sunderland proved they can go toe-to-toe with elite opposition, and that resilience, unity and tactical clarity can bridge gaps in quality.\n\nThe Lasses may have exited the cup, but they did so with heads held high and with the respect of everyone who witnessed their fight.\n\nThe reaction from supporters in the stands and across social media reflected a mixture of pride, frustration and admiration for the sheer resilience Sunderland showed throughout the ninety minutes.\n\nMany fans arrived at Eppleton fully aware of the scale of the challenge ahead, and that sense of realism shaped the tone of the post‑match conversation. Rather than dwelling on the defeat, the overwhelming sentiment was one of respect for a team that refused to fold under relentless pressure.\n\nSupporters were quick to highlight the tactical shift to a 5‑2‑3, acknowledging that it was a necessary adjustment against a London City side packed with technical quality and attacking threat.\n\nFans also praised the discipline with which the players executed the plan, noting how rare it is to see a team maintain concentration so consistently when forced to defend for long spells. The back line in particular drew widespread acclaim, and Roberts and Westrup were spoken about with genuine affection, with supporters describing them as “warriors, leaders, and the heartbeat of the performance”.\n\nSome remarked that the pair seemed to grow stronger the more London City pushed, organising the line with authority and throwing themselves into challenges with a commitment that resonated deeply with the crowd.\n\nThere was also a great deal of admiration for the work rate of players who were asked to operate outside their usual roles.\n\nKitching earned praise for her relentless tracking back and willingness to graft for the team, whilst Scarr received similar recognition, with fans noting how tirelessly she pressed, covered space, and supported the wing‑backs. Supporters appreciated that both players sacrificed their natural attacking instincts for the good of the collective, embodying the spirit that has long defined Sunderland sides across generations.\n\nEven in defeat, fans found encouragement in the way the team responded after going a goal down.\n\nThe shift in momentum during the second half was widely acknowledged, with many supporters commenting that Sunderland grew braver, more assertive and more confident in possession. While the final ball never quite materialised, the intent was there and fans were quick to point out that few teams manage to wrestle back any control against the Lionesses once they fall behind.\n\nThat resilience and refusal to retreat into their shells was something supporters clung to as a sign of progress and character — but of course, there was disappointment too.\n\nSome fans expressed frustration that Sunderland never truly tested Lete, feeling that the team deserved at least one clear chance to reward their defensive heroics. Others lamented the fine margins of cup football, reflecting on how a single lapse or moment of quality can decide a tie even when the overall performance is strong.\n\nBut even these frustrations were tempered by a sense of perspective. Supporters recognised the gulf in resources and squad depth between the two sides, and many commented that to lose by only one goal — and to do so while restricting the Lionesses to so few genuine opportunities — was an achievement in itself.\n\nWhat united the fanbase most was pride — pride in the fight, the discipline and the togetherness — and the applause at full time was extended and heartfelt.\n\nIt wasn’t polite appreciation of a beaten side but genuine acknowledgement of a group of players who’d emptied the tank for the badge. Online, fans echoed that sentiment, describing the performance as “brave”, “resolute”, “full of heart” and “everything you want to see from a Sunderland side”.\n\nThere was also a sense of optimism threaded through the reaction. Supporters spoke about the foundations being laid, the identity being strengthened and the belief that performances like this — even in defeat — can galvanise a squad.\n\nMany pointed out that if Sunderland can defend like that against one of the strongest sides in the competition, they can take confidence into the league and future cup campaigns. The message was clear: this wasn’t a loss that deflated the fanbase — it was one that reinforced their connection to the team.\n\nIn the end, the fan reaction captured the essence of Sunderland Women’s performance: gritty, determined, and full of character.\n\nSupporters left Eppleton knowing their team had given everything and while the cup run ends here, the pride in the performance will linger far longer than the disappointment of the result.\n\nLondon City Lionesses 1 (Geyoro 51’)\n\nSunderland: Moloney, Greenwood, Roberts; Griffiths, Scarr, Dale; Kitching, Brown, Fenton; Sheva, Westrup\n\nSubstitutes: Blench, Paxton, Finn, Cassap, McInnes, Atkinson, Watson, Jones, Blades\n\nLondon City Lionesses: Lete, Fernández, Pattinson; Pérez, Godfrey, Franssi; Roddar, Goodwin, Sangaré; Kennedy, Geyoro\n\nSubstitutes: Orman, Goldie, Corrales, Kumagai, Asllani, Van de Donk, Linari, Parris, Brown",

    "fullText": "Liam Rosenior was back at Stamford Bridge this week, taking charge of Chelsea against Arsenal.\n\nIt wasn’t the result he’d have wanted, with Chelsea falling 3-2 to their London rivals. But there’s still hope for the Blues, as they head into the second leg of the Carabao Cup tie at the Emirates.\n\nChelsea still has a shot at reaching Wembley, and attention now turns to league play. The Blues are preparing to host Brentford in another all-London matchup this Saturday.\n\nRosenior spoke with reporters before kickoff, touching on various topics, including how Raheem Sterling fits into his early plans.\n\nDario Essugo has been a talking point for Rosenior as the midfielder continues his return from injury.\n\nAlthough he has yet to play this season, Essugo is now back to full fitness and available for selection.\n\nRosenior, who rates Essugo’s talent highly, is taking a measured approach to his return, mindful of the thigh injury that sidelined him. The Chelsea boss explained: “Dario’s close. I’m aware of his abilities, I’m aware of his strengths, but I want to give him the best possible moment to show himself in the best way coming back from a long time out because he is a very good player.”\n\nThis suggests that Rosenior will stick with Moises Caicedo, Enzo Fernandez and Andrey Santos in midfield for now.\n\nSantos, who played in Chelsea’s recent defeat to Arsenal, has Rosenior’s trust after his performances at Strasbourg. The Brazilian and Essugo could become key figures for Chelsea in the future if they continue to progress.\n\nOnce Rosenior feels the midfielder is ready, he should be added to Chelsea’s midfield.\n\nEssugo has plenty of skills to bring to the pitch. Last season in La Liga with Las Palmas, he averaged 2.2 tackles per game according to WhoScored, showing how effective he can be without the ball.\n\nChelsea see some similarities between Essugo and Caicedo, and there will be interest in seeing if that comparison becomes more apparent once the former Sporting player gets his chance.",
