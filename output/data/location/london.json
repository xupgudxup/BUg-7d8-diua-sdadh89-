    "fullText": "It’s finally official: top featherweight contenders Movsar Evloev and Lerone Murphy will fight each other in the main event of UFC London, going down on March 21st, 2026.\n\nEvloev and Murphy are ranked No. 1 and No. 3 respectively on the 145 pound rankings, and champion Alexander Volkanovski has been calling for a fight against one or another since he beat No. 2 ranked Diego Lopes the first time in April 2025. But as of now there’s no guarantee the winner of Evloev vs. Murphy will get the next shot at Volk.\n\nLerone Murphy discussed the situation with Ariel Helwani, revealing there was no title shot guarantee that came with the main event booking.\n\n“Eeeeh, at this point, words are wind, innit?” Murphy said. “The division is forever changing. It’s a performance-based company, someone’s got to go out there and put on a good fight and then? Nothing’s concrete. But I hope so.”\n\nThe UFC has been hyper-focused on excitement as a metric for earning title shots, and Murphy suggested it would be hard to earn an exciting win off an opponent like Movsar Evloev.\n\n“I believe the matchmakers know what kind of match this is,” he said. “I think it would be unfair to say you’ve got to go out there and get a crazy knockout to get a title shot. Everybody knows what kind of fight this is going to be and what type of fighter I’m fighting against. So I think the winner should be undeniably next in line for the title. Simple.”\n\nIf there’s one person out there banging the drum for Movsar or Lerone to get a shot, it’s Alexander Volkanovski himself. If excitement and popularity is the metric, then it would be easy for UFC to slot No. 6 ranked Jean Silva into a title fight. But “The Great” is clearly unenthused about that fight.\n\n“You’ve got Silva obviously probably trying to get his name out there,” Volkanovski said in a new interview. “Now he’s saying some stuff and thinking he really deserves next. If the UFC obviously were to push that for me, everyone knows me. I’ll fight anyone. But I don’t think that’s very likely to happen.”\n\n“I don’t think he’s in a position to fight for the title, especially when you’ve got Lerone Murphy and Movsar Evloev fighting very, very soon. I think that’s very clear.”\n\nOnly if you’re looking at things in terms of win streaks and rankings and not social media popularity and action. The winner of Murphy vs. Evloev may leave London with a ten fight win streak compared to Silva’s one. But Silva surfed on his opponent’s back at the end of his last fight, which we must admit was pretty cool.\n\nCool enough to earn a title shot? In today’s UFC, maybe.",

    "description": "Murphy and Evloev will clash in the main event, but will the winner be next for featherweight king Alexander Volkanovski?",
    "fullText": "Lerone Murphy has admitted that his UFC London main event against Movsar Evloev may not be a No 1 contender’s fight, despite theories from many figures in MMA.\n\nOn 21 March, Manchester’s Murphy will face the Russian in a battle of unbeaten featherweights, with champion Alexander Volkanovski keen to face the winner.\n\nNaturally, then, many fans and pundits have been quick to dub the UFC London main event a No 1 contender’s bout, given Murphy and Evloev’s impressive records and Volkanovski’s desire to face either man.\n\nYet it isn’t always that simple in the UFC, as Murphy noted on Monday, shortly after his fight was announced. “Nothing’s concrete,” he said on The Ariel Helwani Show.\n\nStill, Murphy added: “But I hope so. The matchmakers know what type of match-up this is. Everyone knows what type of fight this is going to be, and what type of fighter I’m fighting against.\n\n“So, I think the winner should be undeniably next in line for the title. Simple.”\n\nMurphy, who will carry a 17-0-1 record into the O2 Arena, said of the 19-0 Evloev: “Movsar is elite. He’s a very good fighter, good everywhere, but I just believe I’m going to take him into deep waters.\n\n“It’s going to be defensive wrestling, an ambitious offence, and pressure him to make a mistake. I’ll be hunting for the knockout from bell to bell.”\n\nNews of the match-up came just two days after Volkanovski extended his second reign as featherweight champion with a win over Diego Lopes. Volkanovski outpointed Lopes to retain the title in the main event of UFC 325, nine months after beating the Brazilian in the same manner to win the vacant belt.\n\nAnd the Australian champion used his post-fight press conference to call for a fight with Murphy, 34, or Evloev, 31, next.\n\n“It hurt watching that fight, thinking I should have been there,” Murphy said. “It should have been me [...] I think if I was in there, I would have gotten the job done.\n\n“I see a lot of things in there that I would have been doing. I feel, right now, that I’m the best in the world at featherweight.\n\n“Volk is the guy I have the utmost respect for as a champion. If it were up to him, he would have fought me, and he’s going out there and fighting the next best. It’s how every champion should be. Hopefully I get the chance to share the Octagon with him.”\n\nMurphy last fought in August, taking on UFC debutant Aaron Pico. The Briton stopped the former Bellator star in stunning fashion, with a spinning back elbow, which led Volkanovski to call for a title defence against Murphy.\n\nMeanwhile, Evloev has not fought since December 2024, when he narrowly outpointed Aljamain Sterling, a former bantamweight champion in the UFC.",

    "fullText": "The much-discussed meeting between undefeated featherweights Movsar Evloev and Lerone Murphy is official to headline UFC London on March 21 at the O2 Arena in London, England.\n\nEvloev and Murphy are widely considered to be the two top contenders in the UFC's 145-pound division. Both men were expected to be in the running to challenge UFC champion Alexander Volkanovski. However, that role was ultimately given to Diego Lopes for the second time in nine months at UFC 325 — a decision met by significant controversy.\n\nVolkanovski dispatched Lopes with another one-sided decision this past Saturday in Sydney, Australia, then advocated for one of either Evloev or Murphy to be his next challenger. As such, it's very likely that the winner of UFC London's main event will move on to challenge Volkanovski in the summer.\n\nEvloev (19-0) is a perfect 9-0 under the UFC umbrella, but his rise has been slowed by long stretches of inactivity. The 31-year-old Russian has been sidelined since a December 2024 win over former featherweight champion Aljamain Sterling. He also holds notable victories over Lopes and Arnold Allen.\n\nMurphy (17-0-1) is also 9-0-1 inside the UFC, a run culminating with a highlight-reel spinning back elbow knockout of Aaron Pico this past August that captured Uncrowned's Knockout of the Year award. Included among Murphy's undefeated run are wins over veteran contenders Josh Emmett, Dan Ige and Edson Barboza.\n\nThe official UFC London fight card can be seen below.\n\nFeatherweight: Movsar Evloev vs. Lerone Murphy\n\nFeatherweight: Luke Riley vs. Michael Aswell.\n\nWelterweight: Michael Page vs. Sam Patterson\n\nLight heavyweight: Iwo Baraniewski vs. Austen Lane\n\nMiddleweight: Roman Dolidze vs. Christian Leroy Duncan\n\nFeatherweight: Danny Silva vs. Kurtis Campbell\n\nLightweight: Mason Jones vs. Axel Sola\n\nFeatherweight: Nathaniel Wood vs. Losene Keita\n\nHeavyweight: Louie Sutherland vs. Brando Pericic\n\nMiddleweight: Mantas Kondratavicius vs. Antonio Trocoli\n\nHeavyweight: Mick Parkin vs. Mario Pinto\n\nLightweight: Shem Rock vs. Abdul-Kareem Al-Sewady\n\nStrawweight: Shanelle Dyer vs. Ravena Oliveira",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG/BEIJING, Jan 30 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's visit to China is the latest win Beijing can tout in its rivalry with Washington, but the deals he brings back to London also show the limits of the balancing act that middle powers may try to play.\n\nHe follows Canadian counterpart Mark ​Carney, who struck a trade deal on a similar visit weeks ago, before heading to Davos to herald a new global trade order as U.S. President Donald Trump disrupts long-standing ties with ‌allies.\n\nEuropean leaders have also visited, as have India's Narendra Modi and others since Trump began his second term a year ago, but it is less clear what tangible long-term economic and security benefits such visits yield for Western powers.\n\n\"Traditional U.S. allies feel hard done ‌by and are now hedging their bets, but they are far from being able or willing to substitute China for the United States,\" said John Quelch, an expert in global strategy at Duke Kunshan University.\n\nFrom the perspective of London, Ottawa and other Western capitals, the visits demonstrate to Trump that alternatives exist if he keeps up pressure on issues from Greenland to renegotiating the USMCA trade deal among the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nBut these are \"superficial gestures amid stalled global growth,\" said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis.\n\n\"These visits highlight the severe limits of any 'pivot' to China,\" she said. \"They expose middle powers' vulnerability, chasing scraps while China's export flood overwhelms their industries.\"\n\nAnd they ⁠benefit Beijing, by supporting the narrative of a broad pivot to China ‌as the world's \"reliable partner\", in contrast with Trump's chaotic tariff policies and his growing list of threats and demands towards partners and rivals alike.\n\n\"President Trump’s efforts to decouple the United States from China are also decoupling the United States from the world,\" Quelch added.\n\nSTARMER SCORES WINS ON VISAS, WHISKY\n\nThe deals clinched by Western powers on such ‍visits come in return for deeper integration with a country that ran a trade surplus the size of the Dutch economy last year but where consumption is too weak for even its own producers to prosper at home.\n\nOn his trip to the world's second largest economy, Starmer secured 30-day visa-free access for Britons travelling to China and lower tariffs on whisky, while British drugmaker AstraZeneca unveiled a $15 billion investment in China.\n\nHe got nothing beyond \"frank dialogue\" on tension arising from China's ​increasingly assertive stance on Taiwan, its stronger ties with Russia after the Ukraine invasion and a rights crackdown on Britain's former colony of Hong Kong.\n\nBritish and U.S. politicians who criticised Starmer's trip also aired accusations ‌of espionage and human rights abuse, which Beijing denies.\n\nSimilarly, Carney left China with expectations that Beijing will cut or drop tariffs on canola, lobsters, crabs and peas, but that triggered threats of 100% tariffs from Trump, who warned Ottawa about allowing Chinese EVs into North America.\n\nAnd even before Starmer has wrapped up his China visit, Trump warned Britain it was dangerous to get into business with Beijing, after the prime minister extolled the economic benefits of resetting relations with China.\n\nCHINA'S EXPORT-DRIVEN GROWTH POSES RISKS FOR WEST\n\nChina's imports last year were flat at $2.6 trillion, but they were largely driven by energy and commodities from emerging markets, rather than the West.\n\nIts trade surplus, however, jumped a fifth, to a record $1.2 trillion, as its manufacturers responded to Trump's tariff measures by muscling into virtually every other market in the world, at the expense of domestic producers.\n\nSuch a ⁠pace of growth puts China's trade surplus on track to roughly reach the size of the $3-trillion French economy by 2030 and ​the $5-trillion German economy by 2033.\n\nIts exports to the European Union last year jumped 8.4%, while imports dipped 0.4%. China shipped 7.8% ​more to Britain, while buying 4.7% less. With Canada, sales grew 3.2% while purchases plunged 10.4%.\n\n\"This makes it an especially risky proposition for countries trying to protect or grow their own manufacturing industries to substantially increase trade integration with China,\" said Eswar Prasad, a former China director at the International Monetary Fund.\n\n\"China hardly provides a safe harbour for ‍countries trying to cope with the adverse economic effects ⁠of U.S. tariffs,\" added Prasad, who now teaches trade policy at Cornell University.\n\nStill, say some analysts, significant trade wins with China may not be as important - or even realistic - for countries such as Britain or Canada right now.\n\nResetting ties may be the best they can get, but that could still be valuable, as previous deterioration in relations exposed critical supply chain dependencies on China.\n\nThe Asian ⁠giant's trade countermeasures helped to widen two-way trade imbalances, rather than narrow them, analysts said.\n\nThe visits by Starmer and Carney are \"a propaganda coup for Beijing,\" said Noah Barkin, Europe-China expert at the German Marshall Fund and Rhodium Group, while warning, \"This is not a ‌pivot to China. It is about reducing tension with Beijing.\"\n\nHe added, \"No country wants to be in open conflict with the two superpowers at the same time.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Liangping Gao ‌and Kevin Yao in Beijing and David Kirton in Shenzhen; Writing by Marius Zaharia; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)",

    "fullText": "In-person interactions break down barriers in east London, as AI startups also try to bridge communication divide\n\nWesley Hartwell raised his fists to the barista and shook them next to his ears. He then lowered his fists, extended his thumbs and little fingers, and moved them up and down by his chest, as though milking a cow. Finally, he laid the fingers of one hand flat on his chin and flexed his wrist forward.\n\nHartwell, who has no hearing problems, had just used BSL, British Sign Language, to order his morning latte with normal milk at the deaf-run Dialogue Cafe, based at the University of East London, and thanked Victor Olaniyan, the deaf barista.\n\n“I have to be honest: when this cafe first opened near my office, I avoided it because the whole idea made me anxious,” said Hartwell, a lecturer at the university. “But now I’m fascinated. Sign language is amazing. I’m thinking of taking a course so I can learn more.”\n\nWhat gave Hartwell the confidence to try BSL was the cafe’s touchscreen menu. Instead of just listing the coffees and cakes on sale, the menus show videos of their BSL translation.\n\nFor many deaf BSL users, this kind of direct access is crucial. BSL is a first language for tens of thousands of people in the UK.\n\nOlaniyan, who has worked at the cafe for five years and now does shifts alongside a degree in accounting and management at the University of Reading, seemed mildly amused by the reactions of hearing people to the video menu.\n\n“I was brought up by hearing people, so I have no problem in the hearing world,” he signed. “But hearing people often feel anxious communicating with us. If this technology helps them, that’s great, but I’m fine as I am.”\n\nIn the past two years, there has been an explosion of digital and AI-linked products aiming to bridge communication barriers between the deaf and hearing worlds, from signing avatars to large generative models that aspire to rival mainstream AI platforms.\n\nIndependent evaluations of many of these systems remain limited, however, and sign language researchers caution that current tools still struggle with linguistic nuance, regional variation and context, particularly in high-stakes settings such as healthcare and law.\n\nBut the ambitions are striking: the UK startup Silence Speaks has built an avatar-based system that converts text into BSL, claiming it can convey contextual meaning and emotional cues.\n\nThe British project SignGPT, backed by £8.45m in funding, is developing models to translate between BSL and English in both directions, while also building what it describes as the largest sign languages dataset in the world.\n\nSign languages AI research has also become increasingly collaborative and international: a new £3.5m UK-Japan research project is developing systems trained on natural deaf-to-deaf conversation data rather than interpreter recordings.\n\nMuch of this recent progress has come quickly. When Prof Bencie Woll, a co-investigator of the SignGPT project at University College London’s Deafness, Cognition and Language Research Centre, first entered the field of BSL research, communication beyond face-to-face interaction was extremely limited for deaf people.\n\n“The rest of the world was moving ahead with technology, but deaf people were often left behind,” she said. “What’s different now is the pace. In the last couple of years, the deaf community has benefited from an explosively powerful mix of possibilities.”\n\nHistorically, technology has not always been positive, Woll cautioned. “There has often been a fantasy, particularly among researchers who don’t understand sign languages, that it is a quick fix. That you take a sign language, turn it into written English – and you’ve made deaf people’s lives wonderful,” she said.\n\nThat assumption led to what Woll described as “really terrible technology”, including wearable translation suits, bulky gloves and head-mounted cameras designed to process signing.\n\n“All of these were doomed to failure,” she said, “because they were designed by people who did not understand sign languages and did not ask deaf people what they wanted, let alone work alongside deaf experts from the start. The community has been frustrated for years by the proliferation of bad solutions.”\n\nYet the need for solutions is real. About 70 million people worldwide are deaf or hard of hearing. In the UK, census data records about 151,000 BSL users. For roughly 25,000 of them, BSL is their primary language. It is a distinct, natural language with its own grammar and structure, not a signed version of English.\n\nFor this group, written and spoken English is often a second – or even a third language, following lip-reading, Sign Supported English or family-invented gestures.\n\nThis has practical consequences: subtitles and written text are not always adequate substitutes for direct BSL access. A large 2017 study of deaf children aged 10 to 11 found that reading ability was significantly below expected age levels for 48% of deaf children educated using spoken language only, and for 82% of those whose everyday language was a sign language.\n\nDr Lauren Ward has the unusual role of leading on AI technology for the deaf community at the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), advising government and industry.\n\n“The pace of change has been so fast that RNID has made the unusual decision to employ engineers,” she said. “The potential to help the deaf community is huge – but so is the potential to cause harm.”\n\nDeaf people have long been early adopters of technology: SMS messaging transformed communication in the 1990s. But Ward said the last two years had brought a new intensity of interest and concern. “It has suddenly moved from university labs into startups and commercial products,” she said.\n\nThis shift has been enabled by advances in machine learning and related technologies that finally make the processing of large-scale sign languages technically possible.\n\nIncreased research funding, improved datasets and greater involvement from deaf researchers have also quickened the pace, as has a wider acknowledgment of the longstanding gap between the access deaf people are legally entitled to and what is delivered in practice: reliable sign languages provision has been promised for decades but has all-too-often failed to materialise.\n\nThis combination of opportunity and risk makes the current moment a double-edged sword, Ward said.\n\n“It is incredibly exciting, and the next five years could bring real improvements,” she said. “But there is a danger that private companies respond by focusing on profit rather than working with the deaf community and being led by them.”\n\nDr Maartje De Meulder, a deaf scholar and consultant on sign languages AI, agreed the stakes were high.\n\n“At the moment, deaf people are largely excluded from vast amounts of online information, from educational videos to government websites,” she said. “No one is ever going to have the resources to translate the entire internet into sign languages, so even partial solutions could be transformative.”\n\nNeil Fox, a deaf research fellow at the University of Birmingham, agreed that if avatar translation reached sufficient quality, it could open up many online spaces currently closed to deaf users.\n\nBut all are highly cautious. Rebecca Mansell, the chief executive of the British Deaf Association, said this “has become a very lucrative area and too many projects involve deaf people only tokenistically”.\n\n“It is all happening very fast, and there is a real risk that solutions will be imposed on us,” she added.\n\nMansell also raised concerns about regulation and appropriate use. “An avatar might be fine for ordering something simple,” she said, “but what about a cancer diagnosis? In schools, a human interpreter is often the only friend a deaf child has.”\n\nDr Louise Hickman, from the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy and lead author of the report BSL Is Not For Sale, has worked in AI ethics for a decade.\n\n“Many companies claim they can solve these problems without understanding the linguistic and cultural complexity of BSL,” she said. “Current avatar systems still lack the nuance of human interpreters, which creates risks in medical and legal settings.”\n\nHickman also pointed to the limits of available data. “British Sign Language is not the same as Irish Sign Language or American Sign Language. There are regional dialects within England. This means the data available for training AI systems is extremely limited.”\n\nSo where, she asked, will appropriate training data come from?\n\n“The deaf community wants innovation,” she said, “but we want to slow this down so we can shape it and make sure it genuinely benefits us.”\n\nBack at the cafe, Hakan Elbir, its founder, saw little need for more complex tools than his static BSL video menu.\n\n“People talk a lot about innovation, but for most deaf people it is still theoretical,” he said. “What I wanted was a meaningful daily interaction for hearing people.”\n\n“Coffee is just the excuse,” he added. “I didn’t need complicated technology to break down barriers. I just needed people to interact openly.”\n\nWaiting for his latte at the counter, Hartwell quietly practised the sign for “flat white”, proving that it was this simple, human interaction – supported but not overshadowed by technology – that was drawing him back, one signed coffee order at a time.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING (AP) — U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in the Chinese financial center of Shanghai on Friday in his bid to boost business opportunities for British firms in the world's second-largest economy, just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump signaled a possible opposition to any deal between Beijing and London.\n\nWhy are foreign leaders increasing visits to Beijing?\n\nWhat agreement was reached on British lawmakers sanctions?\n\nWhat business opportunities is Starmer seeking in China?\n\nHow did Trump respond to UK-China negotiations?\n\nStarmer, the center-left Labour leader, has brought more than 50 business leaders on his trip to China, the first by a U.K. prime minister in eight years.\n\nStarmer suggested Trump’s criticism was aimed more at Canada than Britain. He added that Washington was aware in advance of his trip and its objectives and pointed out that Trump has said he plans to visit China this spring.\n\n“I don’t think it’s wise for the United Kingdom to stick its head in the sand,” Starmer told Sky News. “China is the second biggest economy in the world. Along with Hong Kong, it’s our third-biggest trading partner. And through this visit, we’ve opened up lots of opportunities for jobs and wealth creation.”\n\nStarmer started his trip in Beijing on Thursday, where he met with Chinese leaders including Xi Jinping. The two pledged to pursue a long-term and stable strategic partnership in what was seen as a sign of improving ties after several years of friction between the two countries.\n\nIn Washington, Trump suggested that he may oppose any deal between Beijing and London, and then pivoted to Canada, with which he has had a series of sharp exchanges since Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visited China earlier this month.\n\n“Well, it’s very dangerous for them to do that,” he said, when asked about Starmer’s visit and any U.K. trade talks with Beijing. “And it’s even more dangerous, I think, for Canada to get into business with China. Canada is not doing well. They’re doing very poorly.”\n\n“You can’t look at China as the answer,” he said.\n\nStarmer and Carney are among a series of foreign leaders to visit Beijing as their nations seek to improve ties with China. Many have seen their countries’ economies buffeted by Trump’s tariffs and are looking to expand other export markets.\n\nThe British prime minister said Xi agreed to remove a travel ban that had been imposed on several British lawmakers after the U.K.'s former center-right Conservative government joined the European Union, Canada and the U.S. in imposing sanctions on four Chinese officials over evidence of rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim people in the far western Xinjiang region.\n\n“This has been a cause of concern in Parliament and for parliamentarians for some time and that is why I raised it on this visit,\" Starmer told ITV News. “The response from the Chinese is that the restrictions no longer apply and President Xi has told me that that means that all parliamentarians are welcome to visit.”",

    "fullText": "MUMBAI, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Some of the world's biggest reinsurers, including Lloyd's of London, are seeking Indian regulatory approval to operate in a low-tax city set up in the prime minister's home state ​to try to rival other international financial hubs, two sources said.\n\nThe global companies, which also include South Korea’s Samsung Re, ‌Kenya Re and Spain’s Mapfre Re, will join more than a dozen global reinsurers from Europe, the Middle East and Asia that are turning to the new city to ‌gain access to India's $129.78 billion insurance market, estimated by the industry to be the tenth largest in the world.\n\nThe two sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the press, said the companies were expected to seek approval this year.\n\nEmail queries sent to Mapfre Re, Samsung Re and Kenya Re were not answered. A Lloyd’s of London spokesperson declined to comment. The companies' plans to ⁠set up operations in the Gujarat International Finance ‌Tec‑City, or GIFT City, have not been previously reported.\n\nThe city offers businesses favourable tax treatment, such as a 10-year tax holiday and exemption from capital gains.\n\nThe government has said it hopes it will rival Singapore and ‍Dubai as an international financial centre.\n\nIndia's reinsurance market is currently dominated by Swiss Re and Munich Re, as well as private firms and the government-owned GIC Re that is widely expected to grow after the government introduced reforms to deepen India's insurance penetration.\n\nSAUDI RE AND OTHERS HAVE RECEIVED APPROVAL\n\nA few large ​reinsurers have received approvals over the last year to begin operating in GIFT City. These include Saudi Re, Korean Re, Peak Re, ‌Kuwait Re, Abu Dhabi National Insurance and Kazakh‑based Eurasia Insurance Company JSC, according to regulatory officials and company statements.\n\nSaudi Re earlier this week opened its GIFT City branch, its second in Asia after Malaysia.\n\nKorean Re has said its expansion reflected its commitment to India’s high growth insurance sector, while Hong Kong‑based Peak Re, which received a licence in March 2025, said it plans to offer life and non-life insurance.\n\nAbout 14 global reinsurers operate from GIFT City, managing an annualised $700–800 million in premiums, public disclosures show.\n\nThe number of reinsurers is expected to increase ⁠to at least 20 by the end of March 2026, two regulatory officials ​said, declining to be identified as final approvals are pending.\n\nThey said the international reinsurers ​sought to offer products that are relatively underdeveloped in India, including surety bonds, parametric insurance, marine and shipping cover, cyber risk and health reinsurance.",

    "fullText": "LONDON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Former Nigerian oil minister Diezani Alison-Madueke had no real influence over the awarding of lucrative government contracts and was merely a \"rubber stamp\" for official recommendations, her lawyer said on ​Thursday at her London corruption trial.\n\nAlison-Madueke, minister for petroleum resources between 2010 and 2015 under then-president Goodluck Jonathan, has pleaded not ‌guilty to five counts of accepting bribes and a charge of conspiracy to commit bribery.\n\nProsecutors say Alison-Madueke \"enjoyed a life of luxury\" in London, with oil and gas industry ‌figures having provided the use of high-end properties and given her lavish gifts to try and influence the awarding of lucrative contracts.\n\nBut her lawyer Jonathan Laidlaw told jurors at London's Southwark Crown Court that purchases were made on Alison-Madueke's behalf \"because Nigerian ministers are forbidden from having bank accounts abroad\".\n\nHe also said Alison-Madueke, 65, disputes the extent to which properties were provided for her use and the amounts of goods she received, but ⁠that \"all that was spent on her personally, in ‌one way or another, was reimbursed\".\n\nLaidlaw said personal expenses were repaid by Alison-Madueke in Nigeria and expenses relating to official business were \"reimbursed from government coffers\", meaning Alison-Madueke received no financial advantage.\n\n\"If there was any financial advantage, ‍it was to Nigeria, enabling the Minister for Petroleum Resources to undertake her ministerial business and ... there was, of course, nothing improper about it,\" he added.\n\nOTHER ALLEGED BRIBE PAYERS NOT CHARGED IN UK\n\nAlison-Madueke, who was also briefly president of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, is standing trial alongside her brother ​Doye Agama, 69, who has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery relating to his church.\n\nTheir co-defendant Olatimbo Ayinde, 54, ‌has pleaded not guilty to one count of bribing Alison-Madueke between 2012 and 2014 and one count of bribery of a foreign public official.\n\nThe trial, expected to conclude in April, is one of the most high-profile cases relating to alleged corruption in oil-rich Nigeria.\n\nProsecutors say that Nigerian businessman Kolawole Aluko spent more than 2 million pounds ($2.8 million) on items for Alison-Madueke at London department store Harrods alone.\n\nAlison-Madueke is also accused of taking bribes, including gifts and payment for her son's school fees, from prominent oil and gas industry figures.\n\nBut, Laidlaw told the jury, ⁠none of the others named in the charges against Alison-Madueke have been charged, ​nor had Britain sought to have them extradited to stand trial.\n\nMINISTER HAD NO REAL ​INFLUENCE, LAWYER SAYS\n\nLaidlaw said Alison-Madueke's role as minister meant she signed off on oil and gas contracts which were awarded by the Nigerian government.\n\nHe told the jury to ask whether Alison-Madueke had \"any ability to exercise influence upon ‍who would be awarded these contracts ⁠or ... was she effectively a rubber stamp, stamping the recommendations that her civil servants made\".\n\nAlison-Madueke's lawyer also acknowledged that Nigeria, which is one of the world's largest producers of oil and the largest in Africa, had long been blighted by corruption.\n\nHe said, ⁠however, that perception of government and business practices may be different in Britain compared to Nigeria.\n\n\"Things which may seem uncomfortable or extravagant to all of us sitting ‌here in Southwark, may well feel very different to 12 people sitting together in Nigeria,\" Laidlaw told the jury.",

    "fullText": "Fulham have reached an agreement with Manchester City to sign winger Oscar Bobb in a deal worth an initial £27 million.\n\nThe transfer represents a significant move for the west London club as they look to reshape their wide options ahead of the second half of the season.\n\nManchester City will retain a 20 per cent sell-on clause and matching rights should Fulham accept a future bid for the Norway international.\n\nBobb is expected to undergo a medical shortly, with the move likely to be completed in time for the weekend.\n\nFulham view the 22-year-old as a direct replacement for Adama Traore, who has departed Craven Cottage to join West Ham United.\n\nHis arrival also provides important depth amid uncertainty surrounding Harry Wilson, who is out of contract at the end of the campaign.\n\nMarco Silva has prioritised technical wide players comfortable operating on either flank, a profile Bobb fits closely.\n\nThe winger’s pathway at Manchester City narrowed considerably following further attacking reinforcements this month.\n\nThe £82.5 million arrivals of Marc Guehi and Antoine Semenyo increased competition across the forward and midfield lines.\n\nPep Guardiola already has an abundance of options in wide and attacking midfield roles, including Phil Foden, Bernardo Silva, Jeremy Doku and Savinho.\n\nAs a result, Bobb found regular minutes increasingly difficult to secure despite his versatility.\n\nHe has made 15 appearances in all competitions this season, starting only five Premier League matches.\n\nInjuries also disrupted his momentum, including a recent hamstring issue suffered in December.\n\nBobb previously endured a prolonged absence with a broken leg, limiting his involvement across much of last season.\n\nDespite those setbacks, he remains highly regarded for his close control, intelligence between the lines and ability to operate in tight spaces.\n\nHis most memorable contribution for Manchester City came in January 2024, when he scored a dramatic stoppage-time winner away at Newcastle United.\n\nOverall, Bobb made 47 senior appearances for City, scoring three goals during his time at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nThe sale forms part of a wider strategy by City to balance heavy recent spending through player departures.\n\nThey have raised funds in recent windows through exits including James McAtee, Kyle Walker and Ederson.\n\nFor Fulham, the deal represents both ambition and opportunity.\n\nBobb arrives with elite-level experience despite his age and should be afforded greater responsibility in a less crowded attacking unit.\n\nCompetition for minutes is expected, but regular football appears far more attainable.\n\nThe move offers a fresh platform for a player whose development stalled amid fierce competition at City.",

    "fullText": "A Minnesota woman’s family is speaking out after she died while asleep on her mother’s shoulder during an international flight from the U.S. to the U.K.\n\nRachel Green, a 44-year-old attorney and writer, died on a Delta Air Lines flight from Minneapolis to London on April 30, 2025, according to a GoFundMe started by her family.\n\nNow, investigators in the U.K. have revealed what likely caused her death.\n\nThe West London Coroner’s Court recently heard that Green’s death was likely the result of an undiagnosed heart condition in combination with prescription medications, according to The Irish Sun.\n\nDr. Alan Bates, a pathologist, said he found multiple substances in her blood, including melatonin, antidepressants and a small amount of alcohol, the outlet reports.\n\nBates also said he found evidence of myocardial tunneling, a condition in which an artery travels through the heart muscle, rather than on its surface, according to The Irish Sun.\n\nSenior Coroner Lydia Brown reportedly said Green had taken a “range of complex medications,” but there was “no evidence she was taking any in excess.”\n\n“She also had a congenital heart condition. This contributed to her death, along with the medications,” Brown said.\n\nGreen’s sister, Roxanne Carney, said she had an “abnormal” heart test that wasn’t investigated further, according to The Irish Sun. Now, she’s questioning why her sister “was never referred to a cardiologist before being prescribed this combination.”\n\n“Why was she on this regimen? Why are they prescribing this combination of medications?” Carney reportedly said.\n\nShe added: “If you can see all the records, ethically, how can you do this?”\n\nSenior Coroner Lydia Brown said in court that it is typically “reviewed” in the U.K., but that “the entirety of your population doesn’t seem to have that.”\n\n“[It is] unusual to find so many different [drugs]. Matters are done very differently in the U.S.,” Brown reportedly said.\n\nGreen was traveling to London to complete research for an upcoming historical fiction work on Eleanor of Aquitaine, an influential medieval queen, her family said on the GoFundMe page. She was described as a “brilliant writer” who had a keen love of theatre.\n\n“Rachel was beyond selfless, always taking care of everyone around her and trying to guide people to the goodness in life, be it traveling, enjoying a play, or a gathering,” her family wrote.\n\nGreen had also just recovered from an “unexpected illness” that forced her to relocate to her hometown in Minnesota and relearn how to walk.\n\n“She exuded unyielding strength and courage at even the most difficult times,” the GoFundMe page reads.\n\nThe Independent has contacted Carney and Delta Air Lines for comment.",

    "fullText": "Synthesia makes digital presenters for clients to use in corporate videos and counts 70% of FTSE 100 as customers\n\nA British AI startup that makes realistic video avatars has almost doubled its valuation to $4bn (£3bn), in a boost for the UK technology sector.\n\nSynthesia was valued at $2.1bn last year and moved into new offices in central London, marking the moment with a ceremony attended by the Sadiq Khan, the city’s mayor, and Peter Kyle, then technology secretary.\n\nOn Monday, it announced its latest funding round, led by an existing investor, Google Ventures, had raised $200m and valued the British company at $4bn. Google Ventures is the search firm’s venture capital arm.\n\nSynthesia uses human actors to generate digital avatars of people and also offers employers the ability to create replicas of their staff. Those avatars are then deployed by organisations in corporate videos in a range of scenarios such as health and safety in the workplace, advising on cybersecurity and how to communicate better at work.\n\nThe company counts 70% of the FTSE 100 as clients, including NatWest, Lloyds Bank and British Gas. It is also used by non-corporate bodies including the NHS, the European Commission and the United Nations.\n\nThe startup is also developing new avatars that will help train employees and give them new skills, through scenarios such as role-playing and giving tailored explanations.\n\nSynthesia’s co-founder, Steffen Tjerrild, said the increased valuation reflected the commitment of the company’s longstanding backers rather than the investment hype surrounding the AI sector. “Existing investors have seen the progress, have seen the numbers, have seen them compound year over year,” he said. “That is also telling a story that this is less [a case of] external investors trying to kind of hype it up, but more about validation from existing investors as well.”\n\nLast year, a leading British tech investor, James Anderson, said he found sharp increases in valuations of AI startups such as OpenAI and Anthropic “disconcerting”. Tjerrild said Synthesia was focusing on executing its business plan, which, he added, was backed by investors who were long-term supporters.\n\n“This round is led by insiders, or predominantly existing investors that deeply understand the business, have seen the execution and the improvement of the business over many years,” he said.\n\nSynthesia generated revenues of $58.3m in 2024 but made a pre-tax loss of $59.2m, according to its latest published accounts, which the company said reflected its investment in headcount, its technology and new offices. Synthesia said it was on track to make $200m in revenues this year.\n\nThe $4bn valuation puts the company on a par with UK broadcaster ITV, which is worth £3.1bn. Tjerrild’s shareholding in Synthesia is now worth $160m, the same as its chief executive and fellow co-founder, Victor Riparbelli.\n\nSynthesia was founded in 2017 by the two Danish nationals, as well as the computer scientists Matthias Niessner and Lourdes Agapito.\n\nLast year, the London mayor said Synthesia was doing “incredibly well” as he opened its new offices. However, in a speech this month Khan said AI would “usher in a new era of mass unemployment” if used recklessly, as intelligent, autonomous systems proved cheap replacements for humans.\n\nTjerrild said he believed AI would enable businesses to hire more staff. “We’re an AI-first company, we have 600 employees and we hired 40% more people last year,” he said. “As a business owner myself, if my employees become more productive that means I can invest and hire more people.",

    "description": "Tom Cruise has reportedly left the staff at his $47 million London apartment \"stunned\" by his abrupt departure from the UK.",
    "fullText": "Tom Cruise has reportedly left the staff at his $47 million London apartment \"stunned\" by his abrupt departure from the UK.\n\nA source revealed that the actor, who once declared himself an \"Anglophile,\" made the decision to leave for the US \"very quickly,\" describing the move as \"strange.\"\n\nThis comes a few weeks after it was revealed that Tom Cruise and the Church of Scientology had \"angered\" locals of East Grinstead with their disruptions while attending fundraisers in England.\n\nCruise has made an abrupt decision to move back to the US after spending years in the UK, where he was sometimes seen enjoying pub outings and even hanging out with the future king, Prince William.\n\nAccording to a source who spoke with the Mail on Sunday, staff were left \"stunned\" by his sudden departure, with some spotted removing boxes of possessions at the \"Mission Impossible\" star's £35 million [$47 million] London penthouse property, which overlooks Hyde Park.\n\nWhile the reason for his move is currently unclear, a source noted that it happened \"very quickly\" and seemingly out of the blue.\n\nSpeaking with the news outlet, the source said, \"Tom loved London. He loved where he lived; he would get up and go for [a] run around Hyde Park in the mornings. He loved walking in the local area, but he also really, really enjoyed jumping in a helicopter at Battersea Heliport and flying off into the quintessentially British countryside.\"\n\nThe source continued, \"It all happened very quickly; it was a surprise to the staff at the building where his penthouse is. It's most strange. The UK became both his professional headquarters and private playground, with discrete dates, tightly-guarded movements, and late-night arrivals.\"\n\n\"England became far more than just a filming base,\" they added about Cruise's sudden exit.\n\nBefore Cruise's decision to seemingly return to the US, he had become very well known for his love of the UK, where he had been making films for over 40 years.\n\nLast year, the actor was recognized for his contribution to the UK film industry and was awarded a BFI fellowship by the British Film Institute.\n\nAt the event held in May, Cruise noted, \"I'm truly honoured, I've been making films in the UK for over 40 years and have no plans to stop.\"\n\nBack in 2022, the actor also labeled himself an \"Anglophile\" because he spent a lot of \"time in Britain, and that's not just for work reasons.\"\n\n\"I just love being here,\" he stated at the time, per the Daily Mail. \"It's a fantastic blend of old and new... Britain is trendy, too, and has a lot that other countries then copy. I also love the British countryside.\"\n\nCruise was also said to have been interested in buying some properties in the Cotswolds, as he hoped to strengthen his ties to the UK, making his sudden departure, which reportedly included him removing his blackout curtains from his penthouse, even more puzzling.\n\nCruise, who has somewhat become the face of the Church of Scientology because of his vocal support over the years, recently came under fire after locals made complaints about him and his organization.\n\nThe actor makes it a point of duty to attend the Church's annual fundraiser in England. However, last year's edition in December allegedly \"angered\" residents of East Grinstead because of the disruption it brought to their everyday lives.\n\nThe small town located in West Sussex is home to the British headquarters of the Church and often receives guests in large numbers when such events are happening.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, former Scientologist Alexander Barnes-Ross said that the locals are \"extremely frustrated and angered\" by the instant increase in population during the fundraiser, and were particularly uncomfortable with the disturbance caused by Cruise \"flying in on his helicopter.\"\n\n\"It causes a lot of noise and nuisance, and he [Tom Cruise], you know, doesn't stop for photos or anything,\" Barnes-Ross shared.\n\nAccording to the news outlet, a resident described the Church's order of proceedings right from the preparation stages as \"very disruptive.\"\n\n\"For six to eight weeks, they were laying down pallets in the field to make a car park, so we had the disruption and noise of that, with lorry after lorry coming,\" the unidentified local said of Cruise's Church.\n\nDuring the event proper, more of such chaos would follow as the Church uses generators to power heavy equipment and also plays loud musical instruments.\n\nReports suggest the community feels \"helpless\" as to what they'll do, as some town leaders also attend the Church and have a good relationship with the organization.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, locals have since filed a complaint with the Mid Sussex District Council, noting that the event attended by Cruise and other high-profile church members causes \"considerable disruptions\" to the area.\n\nIt allegedly brings about traffic congestion and noise pollution. The complaint would see the Church's premises license undergo a review.\n\nIf the local community wins, the Church could be asked to tone down the large scale of events it organizes or implement measures to protect vulnerable people.",

    "fullText": "LONDON/WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. control of Venezuela's oil exports has ensnared barrels that had been servicing debt to China, lining up another potential showdown between the two superpowers that could further complicate the South American country's path out of default.\n\nAround a tenth of Venezuela's $150 billion foreign debt pile is estimated to be loans from China that ​the OPEC member was paying in oil cargoes - until the U.S. seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro earlier this month.\n\nDebt experts said the ramifications of China's claim on the cargoes and any clash with ‌the United States could make it tougher for Venezuela to restructure its debt after a 2017 default and put at risk Beijing's cooperation in restructuring deals for other developing nations.\n\n\"Even under the best circumstances, this was going to be very messy - trying to disentangle where all ‌these creditors stand in the credit hierarchy,\" said Christopher Hodge, chief economist with Natixis and a former U.S. Treasury official.\n\n\"The fact that now America is controlling all the finances into and out of the country...this seems to be unprecedented to me, that we're going to have such entanglements, such opacity about the finances of a government,\" Hodge said.\n\nWhile Washington currently controls only oil sale proceeds, Hodge noted that these are Venezuela's main source of revenue.\n\nDocuments and sources from state-run oil firm PDVSA show three supertankers have been shuttling between Venezuela and China over the last five years carrying oil for interest payments under the terms of a temporary deal struck in 2019. But these shipments are only ⁠a fraction of Venezuela's total crude exports to China.\n\nAidData, a research lab at ‌the U.S. university William & Mary that tracks lending, said some cash proceeds from oil sent to China went into an account controlled by Beijing and on to service the debt - even as sanctions and default blocked payments to many of Venezuela's other creditors.\n\nThe Trump administration has now said that proceeds from the sale of Venezuela's oil will go into ‍a Qatar-based account controlled by Washington, potentially giving the U.S. President himself substantial leverage over which creditors get paid, and when.\n\nIn response to a request for comment on the cargoes and debt payments, China's foreign ministry said Beijing \"has repeatedly stated its position\".\n\nBeijing condemned the redirection of Venezuelan oil exports during a January 7 news conference, adding \"legitimate rights and interests of China and other countries in Venezuela must be protected\".\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Reuters that Trump had brokered an oil deal with Venezuela ​that \"will benefit the American and Venezuelan people\".\n\nThe Trump administration is allowing China to purchase Venezuelan oil but not at the \"unfair, undercut\" prices at which Caracas sold the crude previously, a U.S. official said on Thursday.\n\nTraders managing Venezuelan oil ‌sales have offered some to Chinese refiners, but these are private market transactions, not intended as debt payments.\n\n\"The people of Venezuela will collect a fair price for their oil from China and other nations,\" the U.S. official said.\n\nThe Venezuelan communications ministry, which handles all press inquiries for the government, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nTrump could yet make a deal with China. However, the planned U.S. takeover of Venezuela's oil sector and control of its revenue could upend the hierarchy of creditors, restructuring advisors warn.\n\n\"All of these things will have the practical effect of subordinating the claims of legacy debtholders,\" said global sovereign debt expert Lee Buchheit, adding it was unclear if Trump had the legal right to determine who gets paid first.\n\nSome $60 billion of Venezuela's bonds tipped into default in 2017, and a restructuring agreement is essential to enable it to borrow again and attract new ⁠investment.\n\nIn a typical restructuring, bilateral lenders come together and agree what losses they will accept, usually via the Paris Club of ​creditor nations. This sets the bar for the \"comparable\" losses private lenders - bond investors, banks and others - must take.\n\n\"Comparability of treatment will be ​a real challenge, particularly if the U.S. controls the use of oil revenues,\" said Mark Walker, a longtime sovereign debt advisor who previously worked on potential Venezuelan restructurings.\n\nIf the U.S. pushes China to swallow significant writedowns on its debt - and China digs its heels in - it could slow a restructuring and hinder Venezuela's economic recovery in the process.\n\nThat could ‍keep Venezuela \"in very dire straits during the foreseeable future\", said ⁠Jean-Charles Sambor, head of emerging market debt with TT International, which holds Venezuelan bonds. In turn, this would limit how much the country can afford to repay to bondholders and other creditors.\n\nChina has little immediate leverage. Countries typically do not take other nations to court or arbitration over lending claims, Walker said, and would need to settle the situation \"on a government-to-government basis\".\n\nBut ramifications are possible: China is the ⁠largest bilateral lender to the developing world and its cooperation with the Paris Club has been crucial over the past decade. Beijing agreed restructuring terms via a platform called the Common Framework during Ghana, Zambia and Ethiopia's debt restructuring talks.\n\n\"China's obvious leverage is to refuse ‌to cooperate in future Common Framework sovereign debt workouts until it feels that it has been treated fairly in Venezuela,\" Buchheit said. \"And that threat would have some force.\"",

    "title": "Starting XI: Xhaka Out? Diarra And Talbi Back? Is This Sunderland’s Team To Take On West Ham?",
    "description": "Is this how Sunderland will line up at the London Stadium today?",
    "fullText": "With Habib Diarra and Chemsdine Talbi back from AFCON, Sunderland have a full strength squad to choose from… or is that HAD a full strength squad to choose from? Last night, rumours were swirling around on social media that Granit Xhaka had an injury that would keep him out for a couple of months – although subsequent rumours suggested it wasn’t as serious as all that, and it was an injury he’d been playing with for the past few weeks. We know Xhaka’s travelled with the squad from the pictures the club posted online, so fingers crossed he’s fit and the rumours are a load of rubbish! On the basis of Xhaka being fit, here’s how I think we’ll line up today.\n\nRoefs made a couple of good saves early on against Palace to prevent us from going behind earlier than we did. He’ll have been a little disappointed he didn’t get more on the ball in the lead up to Palace’s goal, but he had another fine game overall – something we’ve come to expect now!\n\nIt was great to see Reinildo back in the team last week – he offers so much in every department and is a class act. Ballard and Alderete performed well too; indeed it was Ballard and Mukiele who were heavily involved in the build up to Le Fee’s goal on Saturday, and they were solid defensively, too. Unchanged at the back.\n\nTrai Hume will be in the team, and he’ll play in that hybrid right midfield / centre midfield / right back / centre back position that enables other people such as Ballard and Mukiele to spring forward, as we saw in the build up to Le Fee’s goal on Saturday. I’m hedging my bets and saying Xhaka will play, but if not I think it’ll be Geertruida who comes in as a straight swap. I reckon Diarra will be on the bench today as he is reintegrated back into the team, while Sadiki and Le Fee will stay in their usual positions – Le Bris hinted as much regarding Le Fee, so I don’t see any change there. The only question for me is who plays on the left. Romaine Mundle’s done ok in recent weeks but is still building his match fitness, and something just doesn’t seem right with Adingra, so we could see Talbi straight back in the team. The question here is his fitness – frustratingly he barely played at AFCON, so he could either be raring to go or in need of some training to get up to match sharpness. If it’s the former, I think he’ll be straight back in.\n\nBrobbey’s been superb recently and will be vitally important today as he looks to add to his goal tally so far. His fitness is spot on now and he’s holding the ball up brilliantly. Hopefully we can get the ball to him a bit more as he’s capable of scoring a decent amount of goals for us, given the chance.",

    "description": "From Rooney's Plymouth to Xhaka's European push - how far have we come in 12 months?",
    "fullText": "Ahead of Saturday and our return fixture against West Ham, I can’t help but cast my mind back to August 16th 2025. The Stadium of Light was absolutely pulsating and West Ham were the unfortunate souls tasked with welcoming us back to the Premier League. That 3-0 demolition job, with Eliezer Mayenda, Dan Ballard and Wilson Isidor writing their names into the season’s opening chapter, felt like somewhat of a fever dream.\n\nWith the power of retrospect, that win was not simply just the result of adrenaline but was, instead, a statement. It told other teams in this league that we’re not here to make up the numbers.\n\nAs we near the end of January, we’re right in the mix for the European places, sitting comfortably on 33 points.\n\nTwelve months ago, we were in the mire of the Championship, giving tactical mastermind Wayne Rooney and his soon-to-be-doomed Plymouth squad a generous point at our home ground.\n\nFast forward to today, and as we prepare for the return fixture at the Taxpayers’ Stadium on Saturday, the landscape has changed entirely. Had someone told me in that Plymouth game that we would not only be promoted but would then remain unbeaten at home during the first half of a Premier League season, I’d have called for a straitjacket.\n\nWhat Régis Le Bris, along with Kristian Speakman, our recruitment team and the players themselves, have done in half a season is nothing short of remarkable.\n\nFrom the home fixture against West Ham, I feel like we’re in an even stronger position as a team. Gone are the days of the slightly chaotic Championship side. Instead, in its place, is a disciplined, suffocating Premier League unit. Not only that, but the synergy between the players and fans is clear to see.\n\nWhen we fell behind against Crystal Palace, there was no sense of panic or dread. We knew that chances would come.\n\nHitting 33 points before February is truly incredible. It represents a springboard and reflects one of the most exciting periods to be supporting Sunderland AFC. For me, any fear of relegation has been replaced by the genuine, albeit mildly terrifying, prospect of a European tour. Twelve months ago, we were sweating over Championship play-off permutations…\n\nWe head into this weekend sitting in 9th place and only 3 points away from 4th. Saturday isn’t just about three points, though. It’s about doing the double over a struggling West Ham side and providing a clear sign of how far the pendulum has swung. With solid recruitment and relentlessly high expectations driven from Granit Xhaka, we’re demonstrating that we are not just a “plucky” promoted side. Under Régis Le Bris, we’ve found a level of tactical maturity that, frankly, should have taken years to cultivate. This isn’t the same Sunderland of the late 2010s, where we relied upon miracles and had to endure weekly rallying cries. Instead, it’s a tactically astute outfit that has spent the last five months proving every pundit wrong.\n\nThe journey from August 16th to where we are today is remarkable. If the opening day win was a statement, then the last five months have been the proof. I, for one, can’t wait to see where we end up in 12 months.",

    "fullText": "Dortmund took a large (and loud) away contingent to London for this midweek tie that would see the winner jump to the automatic qualification spots. Thomas Frank’s Spurs came into it on the back of five winless games, with stale displays seeing ever-increasing numbers of fans voice their discontent with his management. By contrast, we had only lost one in our last twelve and, while our own game wasn’t much to write home about, it was effective enough that one might reasonably expect us to win this one.\n\nUnfortunately, we started on the back foot and never quite got off it, as the hosts headed into the break two goals and a man up. Niko Kovac attempted to steady his obviously shaken troops, making two defensive changes at half time, and while Spurs looked far less threatening, our offensive play remained non-existent, with our first (and only) shot on target a Nico Schlotterbeck header in the 91st minute. A well-deserved loss, then, and a huge missed opportunity. Here are your match ratings.\n\nNot much he could’ve done about the two he conceded. Stood up well to Kolo Muani’s late chance.\n\nGets a point extra for his very obvious desire to keep going even after several of his teammates’ heads had dropped. Timing of the challenge was often poor.\n\nPossibly the only defender to leave this game without a serious blot on his copybook.\n\nReally struggled with the pacy Odobert after Svensson’s sending off, didn’t cover himself in glory today.\n\nI have no idea what he contributed.\n\nOne of the first players to lose steam after the second goal. Made several careless errors.\n\nStarted brightly, but looked increasingly lost as the game wore on.\n\nUnfortunately, can’t really have complaints about the red. It put us in an awful position, which Spurs really exploited.\n\nThe red card left him marooned on the left wing, chasing the shadows of quicker players without support.\n\nShould really have done better on the break in the first half, but I can’t fault him for his second 45; he had absolutely no support up there.\n\nDidn’t press, didn’t run, didn’t even look interested in trying to contribute.\n\nAdded some spine to the midfield.\n\nGets a six simply because of the insane work rate he demonstrated immediately after coming on. Was clearly up for it and I could imagine things being very different if he’d started up top. A must-start.\n\nSpurs were (unexpectedly) legitimately good today and good value for their win. We, by contrast, looked stunned from the get-go and never really got going, with Svensson’s red card effectively sealing our fate. Several poor individual performances were compounded by an apparent lack of belief post the red, making the rest of the game more or less a formality. It’s clear to me that, while a hard worker, Bellingham lacks the requisite nous for this level, and Couto cannot be relied upon to consistently perform. The final player I’m going to single out is Serhou Guirassy, who once again provided zero industry up front; I have no problem with a striker not scoring when he isn’t receiving service, but he really has to have a bit more grit about him and a much better first touch. Fabio Silva looked miles ahead when he came on.\n\nOverall, Kovac’s approach was typically pragmatic, but one has to wonder if things might’ve been different had he reacted better to the red. Shifting to a 4-4-1 resulted in Bensebaini going up against a winger he had no hope of catching and relegated Brandt to a spectator’s role, especially without the more active Silva to make things happen up top. It also put a whole lot of responsibility on the as-yet unready Bellingham and forced Adeyemi into an unnatural wide position. After the substitutions at half, the team was entirely rudderless going forward, as Adeyemi was tasked with making something out of absolutely nothing all on his own. Things improved marginally after Carney and Silva came on, but nowhere near enough for us to even dream of a point. Once, more I’m left wondering if Kovac has the ability to really inspire a team to rally against adversity; we seem more likely to lose from a winning position than win from a losing one, and that was on full display today.",

    "description": "A large multicentre clinical trial led by King’s College London with 150 children and adolescents has shown that a device cleared by the US FDA to treat ADHD is not effective in reducing symptoms.",
    "fullText": "A large multicentre clinical trial led by King’s College London with 150 children and adolescents has shown that a device cleared by the US FDA to treat ADHD is not effective in reducing symptoms.\n\nThe device – which uses an approach called trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) - was cleared for use by the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) to treat ADHD in 2019 based on a small study. These new findings from a larger multicentre trial, published in the journal Nature Medicine, suggest authorities should revisit the original evidence that supported the FDA clearance. Notably, TNS is currently not recommended for use in the UK by NICE guidelines.\n\nThe trial was run in collaboration with University of Southampton and funded by the Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation (EME) Programme, a partnership between the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) and the UKRI Medical Research Council (MRC), with further support from the NIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre.\n\nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects five to eight per cent of school-age children worldwide and is associated with age-inappropriate problems with attention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity that can impair everyday functioning. Stimulant medications improve symptoms in 70 per cent of those who take them in the short term but there is less evidence of their long-term effects.\n\nTo provide an alternative to medication researchers have developed and trialled approaches that use non-invasive stimulation of the brain, working on the regions that have been identified as influential in ADHD.\n\nOne of these approaches involves stimulating the trigeminal nerve (TNS), targeting a branch of this facial nerve which is thought to activate the brainstem and from there other brain regions that may be relevant to ADHD, in particular the locus coeruleus, which plays a role in arousal which is typically diminished in people with ADHD. TNS is thought to stimulate other brain regions associated with attention such as frontal and thalamic areas via the brainstem in a bottom-up manner.\n\nA previous small trial in the US with 62 children diagnosed with ADHD has shown that when TNS is applied every night for eight hours for one month it is effective in reducing symptoms – this research led to its clearance by the FDA for use in the US. However, the control condition involved no stimulation, and blinding was not tested after one month, raising questions about a potential placebo effect.\n\nThis new UK clinical trial across two sites in London and Southampton tested TNS in a wider range of 150 children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD aged between eight and 18 years old and applied a more rigorous placebo condition. Half of the sample received real TNS for about 9 hours every night for four weeks through battery-powered electrodes applied to the forehead. The other half of the sample received the ‘sham’ condition where electrodes were still applied to the forehead every night for four weeks but participants only received 30 seconds of stimulation every hour at a lower frequency and pulse width, which are thought to be non-effective and hence act as a “control” condition.\n\nOur study shows how important it is to design an appropriate placebo condition in clinical trials of brain therapies. There is a large placebo effect with high-tech brain therapies, in particular for patients and families that have an expectation that they can adjust brain differences associated with ADHD. It is hence paramount to control for placebo effects in modern brain therapies to avoid false hopes.\n\nDr Aldo Conti, postdoctoral researcher at IoPPN and at Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery & Palliative Care, King’s College London and first author on the study said: “This multicentre trial was designed to address key limitations of the previous pilot study that informed FDA clearance of TNS for ADHD, particularly by using a rigorously controlled sham condition that supported successful blinding across the treatment period. Unlike the earlier study, which was limited to younger children, we also included adolescents, a clinically important group given well-documented challenges with long-term medication adherence. These design choices enabled a more robust and clinically relevant evaluation of TNS.”\n\nThe trial showed that TNS was safe with no serious adverse events and most participants considered it a mild or no burden to use. However, the results showed no significant change in ADHD symptoms, objective measures of hyperactivity, attention and associated behaviours around mood and sleep.\n\nProfessor Samuele Cortese, NIHR Research Professor at University of Southampton and study lead for the Southampton site, stated: “Rigorous evidence, such as that generated by this study, is essential for supporting shared decision-making regarding interventions for ADHD. It empowers individuals with ADHD and their families to make informed choices about the treatment of ADHD. Clinicians, individuals with ADHD, and their families need to know which treatments work, and which do not based on the best evidence.”\n\nThe trial was run by the King’s Clinical Trials Unit and recruitment involved the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) clinics within the following NHS trusts: South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare (previously known as SOLENT NHS Trust), Central and North-West London NHS Foundation Trust, Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust and South-West London and St. George’s Mental Health NHS Trust.\n\nExternal trigeminal nerve stimulation in youth with ADHD: a randomized, sham-controlled, phase 2b trial by Conti, A.A. et al was published in Nature Medicine. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-04075-x\n\nProfessor of Cognitive Neuroscience\n\nPostdoctoral Research Associate",

    "fullText": "England trio Liam Livingstone, Jamie Overton and Charlie Dean are among the new signings made by London Spirit for the 2026 Hundred season.\n\nSpirit, who are based at Lord's, have made eight signings in total, with Australia leg-spinner Adam Zampa and big-hitting South Africa batter Dewald Brevis also joining the men's team.\n\nAustralia's Grace Harris remains at the franchise alongside Dean, while seamer Mahika Gaur and South Africa legend Marizanne Kapp have also been added to the women's squad which will be led by ex-England head coach Jon Lewis.\n\nKapp, 36, joins from Oval Invincibles, for whom she was named player of the match in the 2022 final of The Hundred. She has taken 46 wickets in The Hundred, the fourth-highest tally in the competition's history.\n\n\"It is brilliant to be able to call upon players of such calibre in the women's game,\" said Lewis.\n\n\"I am delighted London Spirit fans will see the return of two favourites in Charlie and Grace, and I know Mahika and Marizanne will provide real skill and experience to our bowling attack.\"\n\nAll Hundred teams are allowed to directly sign or retain four players before the auction - a new addition for this season - which is set to take place in March.\n\nBrevis, 22, holds the highest individual T20 score in South Africa after he smashed 161 from 57 balls in the CSA T20 Challenge in 2022. He will be making his debut in The Hundred.\n\nLivingstone moves from Birmingham Phoenix, having been named as the men's player of the tournament in 2021, while Overton gets the chance to build on the 2025 season when he finished as Spirit's leading wicket-taker.\n\nZampa has taken 30 wickets at an average of 13.13 in The Hundred. No player has taken more wickets at a lower average.\n\nElsewhere, Southern Brave has retained England fast bowler Jofra Archer while New Zealand spinner Mitchell Santner and Australia seamer Kim Garth have become Trent Rockets' final two direct signings.\n\nLeft-armer Santner, 33, has taken more than 250 shortest-format wickets at an average of just 23.96, and has been his country's white-ball captain since December 2024.\n\nAlongside him, 29-year-old Garth is set for a second stint in The Hundred, after previously turning out for Manchester Originals (now Manchester Super Giants) in 2024.",

    "title": "Lasses Review: Pride In Defeat As Sunderland’s FA Cup Journey Ends",
    "description": "Charlotte Patterson reports from Eppleton as Sunderland Women’s FA Cup campaign was curtailed by London City Lionesses",
    "fullText": "The Adobe Women’s FA Cup clash between Sunderland AFC Women and London City Lionesses at Eppleton Colliery Welfare Ground was always destined to be a stern test for the Lasses.\n\nWith London City arriving as one of the most possession-dominant and technically proficient sides in the competition, Sunderland knew they would need to adapt tactically to withstand the pressure, and adapt they did, shifting from their usual 4-2-3-1 formation to a more compact and defensively resilient 5-2-3 setup designed to absorb the Lionesses’ attacking waves and strike on the counter.\n\nFrom the opening whistle, the Lionesses asserted their dominance in possession, moving the ball with precision and intent.\n\nSunderland, however, weren’t passive observers and their five-player back line — marshalled superbly by Rhiannon Roberts, Hannah Greenwood and Brianna Westrup — held firm, maintaining shape and discipline. Jessica Brown and Louise Griffiths flanked the triple pairing, whilst Emily Scarr and Katie Kitching dropped deep to support defensively.\n\nGrace Moloney was largely untroubled in the opening forty five minutes. Aside from a dangerous cross that she punched clear with authority, she had little else to do — a testament to the defensive wall erected in front of her.\n\nThe Lionesses’ attempts to penetrate the final third were repeatedly thwarted, with Sunderland’s midfield duo of Natasha Fenton and Marissa Sheva working tirelessly to close passing lanes and disrupt rhythm.\n\nKitching, deployed on the wing rather than in her usual number ten role, showed tremendous work rate, tracking back and doubling up defensively when needed. Scarr mirrored that commitment on the opposite flank, never shirking her duties and often initiating the press when the Lionesses looked to build from the back.\n\nDespite the Lionesses’ territorial advantage, they were severely restricted in terms of clear-cut chances — Sunderland’s compact shape and aggressive pressing in key areas ensuring that shots on target were virtually non-existent in the first half.\n\nSunderland even had their own chances to take the lead when Eleanor Dale’s shot looked set to beat the keeper until a last-second block sent it over the bar. Fenton also went close when her shot ricocheted off the post as she aimed for the bottom corner after the set piece.\n\nThe deadlock was broken shortly after the interval.\n\nA moment of quality from the visitors saw Grace Geyoro slip the ball through to Wassa Sangaré, who timed her run perfectly and slotted past Moloney with composure. It was a cruel blow for Sunderland, who’d defended with such heart and organisation.\n\nHowever, the goal seemed to galvanise the Lasses and Sunderland began to grow into the game, pushing higher up the pitch and enjoying spells of possession. Fenton and Sheva started to find pockets of space, and Brown began to link play more effectively in midfield.\n\nSubstitutions followed as Sunderland looked to inject fresh energy and chase an equaliser.\n\nKaty Watson and Izzy Atkinson replaced Dale and Kitching in order to add some much-needed fresh legs, whilst Scarr moved into a forward position. London City responded with changes of their own, introducing their big guns in Danielle van de Donk, Saki Kumagai, Nikita Parris and Kosovare Asllani in order to regain control.\n\nDespite Sunderland’s increased intent, the visitors’ defence remained resolute.\n\nBalls into the box were swiftly dealt with, and Elene Lete was never truly tested. Sunderland’s best moments came from wide areas, with Kitching and Scarr continuing to drive forward, but the final ball lacked the precision needed to unlock the defence.\n\nSheva did have an opportunity int he dying moments of the game with a cross-shot, but it wasn’t enough to trouble the goalkeeper or to send the fans into frenzied celebrations.\n\nAs the referee blew for full time, the scoreline read 0-1 to London City Lionesses.\n\nOn paper, it was a narrow defeat; in reality, it had been a performance that spoke volumes about Sunderland’s character, determination, and tactical discipline.\n\nTo face such a technically gifted side and limit them to a single goal from a set piece was a remarkable achievement. The back line — led by Roberts and Westrup — was immense throughout, constantly organising, communicating and throwing bodies in front of shots, and Moloney’s calm presence behind them added further assurance.\n\nKitching and Scarr’s defensive contributions were vital, while Fenton and Sheva battled relentlessly in midfield. Though Sunderland didn’t manage to test Lete, their second half response showed bravery and ambition.\n\nThis tie will be remembered not for the scoreline, but for the spirit Sunderland showed. Against one of the strongest sides in the competition, they stood firm, adapted intelligently and fought for every ball. The tactical switch to a 5-2-3 was bold and effective, and the players executed it with discipline and heart.\n\nAlthough the journey ends here, the performance lays a foundation of belief as Sunderland proved they can go toe-to-toe with elite opposition, and that resilience, unity and tactical clarity can bridge gaps in quality.\n\nThe Lasses may have exited the cup, but they did so with heads held high and with the respect of everyone who witnessed their fight.\n\nThe reaction from supporters in the stands and across social media reflected a mixture of pride, frustration and admiration for the sheer resilience Sunderland showed throughout the ninety minutes.\n\nMany fans arrived at Eppleton fully aware of the scale of the challenge ahead, and that sense of realism shaped the tone of the post‑match conversation. Rather than dwelling on the defeat, the overwhelming sentiment was one of respect for a team that refused to fold under relentless pressure.\n\nSupporters were quick to highlight the tactical shift to a 5‑2‑3, acknowledging that it was a necessary adjustment against a London City side packed with technical quality and attacking threat.\n\nFans also praised the discipline with which the players executed the plan, noting how rare it is to see a team maintain concentration so consistently when forced to defend for long spells. The back line in particular drew widespread acclaim, and Roberts and Westrup were spoken about with genuine affection, with supporters describing them as “warriors, leaders, and the heartbeat of the performance”.\n\nSome remarked that the pair seemed to grow stronger the more London City pushed, organising the line with authority and throwing themselves into challenges with a commitment that resonated deeply with the crowd.\n\nThere was also a great deal of admiration for the work rate of players who were asked to operate outside their usual roles.\n\nKitching earned praise for her relentless tracking back and willingness to graft for the team, whilst Scarr received similar recognition, with fans noting how tirelessly she pressed, covered space, and supported the wing‑backs. Supporters appreciated that both players sacrificed their natural attacking instincts for the good of the collective, embodying the spirit that has long defined Sunderland sides across generations.\n\nEven in defeat, fans found encouragement in the way the team responded after going a goal down.\n\nThe shift in momentum during the second half was widely acknowledged, with many supporters commenting that Sunderland grew braver, more assertive and more confident in possession. While the final ball never quite materialised, the intent was there and fans were quick to point out that few teams manage to wrestle back any control against the Lionesses once they fall behind.\n\nThat resilience and refusal to retreat into their shells was something supporters clung to as a sign of progress and character — but of course, there was disappointment too.\n\nSome fans expressed frustration that Sunderland never truly tested Lete, feeling that the team deserved at least one clear chance to reward their defensive heroics. Others lamented the fine margins of cup football, reflecting on how a single lapse or moment of quality can decide a tie even when the overall performance is strong.\n\nBut even these frustrations were tempered by a sense of perspective. Supporters recognised the gulf in resources and squad depth between the two sides, and many commented that to lose by only one goal — and to do so while restricting the Lionesses to so few genuine opportunities — was an achievement in itself.\n\nWhat united the fanbase most was pride — pride in the fight, the discipline and the togetherness — and the applause at full time was extended and heartfelt.\n\nIt wasn’t polite appreciation of a beaten side but genuine acknowledgement of a group of players who’d emptied the tank for the badge. Online, fans echoed that sentiment, describing the performance as “brave”, “resolute”, “full of heart” and “everything you want to see from a Sunderland side”.\n\nThere was also a sense of optimism threaded through the reaction. Supporters spoke about the foundations being laid, the identity being strengthened and the belief that performances like this — even in defeat — can galvanise a squad.\n\nMany pointed out that if Sunderland can defend like that against one of the strongest sides in the competition, they can take confidence into the league and future cup campaigns. The message was clear: this wasn’t a loss that deflated the fanbase — it was one that reinforced their connection to the team.\n\nIn the end, the fan reaction captured the essence of Sunderland Women’s performance: gritty, determined, and full of character.\n\nSupporters left Eppleton knowing their team had given everything and while the cup run ends here, the pride in the performance will linger far longer than the disappointment of the result.\n\nLondon City Lionesses 1 (Geyoro 51’)\n\nSunderland: Moloney, Greenwood, Roberts; Griffiths, Scarr, Dale; Kitching, Brown, Fenton; Sheva, Westrup\n\nSubstitutes: Blench, Paxton, Finn, Cassap, McInnes, Atkinson, Watson, Jones, Blades\n\nLondon City Lionesses: Lete, Fernández, Pattinson; Pérez, Godfrey, Franssi; Roddar, Goodwin, Sangaré; Kennedy, Geyoro\n\nSubstitutes: Orman, Goldie, Corrales, Kumagai, Asllani, Van de Donk, Linari, Parris, Brown",

    "fullText": "Liam Rosenior was back at Stamford Bridge this week, taking charge of Chelsea against Arsenal.\n\nIt wasn’t the result he’d have wanted, with Chelsea falling 3-2 to their London rivals. But there’s still hope for the Blues, as they head into the second leg of the Carabao Cup tie at the Emirates.\n\nChelsea still has a shot at reaching Wembley, and attention now turns to league play. The Blues are preparing to host Brentford in another all-London matchup this Saturday.\n\nRosenior spoke with reporters before kickoff, touching on various topics, including how Raheem Sterling fits into his early plans.\n\nDario Essugo has been a talking point for Rosenior as the midfielder continues his return from injury.\n\nAlthough he has yet to play this season, Essugo is now back to full fitness and available for selection.\n\nRosenior, who rates Essugo’s talent highly, is taking a measured approach to his return, mindful of the thigh injury that sidelined him. The Chelsea boss explained: “Dario’s close. I’m aware of his abilities, I’m aware of his strengths, but I want to give him the best possible moment to show himself in the best way coming back from a long time out because he is a very good player.”\n\nThis suggests that Rosenior will stick with Moises Caicedo, Enzo Fernandez and Andrey Santos in midfield for now.\n\nSantos, who played in Chelsea’s recent defeat to Arsenal, has Rosenior’s trust after his performances at Strasbourg. The Brazilian and Essugo could become key figures for Chelsea in the future if they continue to progress.\n\nOnce Rosenior feels the midfielder is ready, he should be added to Chelsea’s midfield.\n\nEssugo has plenty of skills to bring to the pitch. Last season in La Liga with Las Palmas, he averaged 2.2 tackles per game according to WhoScored, showing how effective he can be without the ball.\n\nChelsea see some similarities between Essugo and Caicedo, and there will be interest in seeing if that comparison becomes more apparent once the former Sporting player gets his chance.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior has issued a mixed injury update ahead of Saturday’s must-win London derby six-pointer against Brentford at Stamford Bridge.\n\nThe Blues are going through a turbulent period and not for the first time, but the focus is now firmly on today’s contest on home turf.\n\nHowever, Chelsea are dealing with a significant injury blow, with Rosenior confirming that Malo Gusto will play no part in the capital derby.\n\nThe France international is still battling discomfort that could keep him out for a third game running.\n\nGusto has been a key player for Chelsea this season. He has only missed two of the club’s 19 Premier League games so far, while contributing two goals and two assists.\n\nThe 22-year-old right back missed Chelsea’s last two cup fixtures against Charlton Athletic and Arsenal due to injury, and he won’t be ready in time to face the Bees.\n\nRosenior has confirmed that Gusto trained on his own at Cobham on Thursday, but didn’t clarify when the defender will return to the fold.\n\n“I can’t put a time frame on it, because there is no time frame,” Rosenior told reporters during his pre-match press conference.\n\n“It’s more of a pain issue, so when he feels comfortable, that’s when he’ll be back with the group.”\n\nWhile Gusto’s absence will be a huge blow for Chelsea, there were some other encouraging news surrounding Dario Essugo.\n\nThe Portuguese midfielder, who joined Chelsea in a deal worth around £18.5 million, is yet to play a single minute of football for the Blues this season.\n\nHe hasn’t gotten a chance to prove his worth due to injuries, but was an unused substitute across the last two cup fixtures.\n\n“He was very close to coming on against Arsenal,” Rosenior said.\n\n“Dario’s close. I’m aware of his abilities, but I want to give him the best possible moment to show himself in the best way coming back from a long time out because he is a very good player.”\n\nRosenior has endured a mixed start to life at Chelsea but will hope to get his side back to winning ways when they host Brentford.",

    "fullText": "A West London Derby awaits this weekend, as Chelsea host Brentford at Stamford Bridge.\n\nThe game marks Liam Rosenior’s first league game in charge of the Blues since joining the club a little over a week ago. His first two matches resulted in a 5-1 away win over Charlton in the FA Cup 3rd Round, and a 3-2 home loss to Arsenal in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final.\n\nHowever, Brentford provide no easy challenge with Keith Andrews’ men unbeaten in six games, winning five, across all competitions. Andrews’ side picked up a 2-0 win against Sheffield Wednesday last time out to advance to the fourth round of the Emirates FA Cup.\n\nThe Bees currently find themselves above Chelsea by three places – and two points – in the Premier League table, with forward Igor Thiago being the standout performer so far.\n\nThe Brazilian has already netted 16 league goals this term and will be hoping to add to that tally come Saturday afternoon.\n\nChelsea, by contrast, are having a turbulent season and currently sit 8th in the table having amassed 31 points from their opening 21 games this campaign.\n\nThe Blues are without a win in their last five top flight outings, a run that stretches back to December 13th when they beat Everton 2-0.\n\nThe reverse fixture between the two earlier this season finished in a 2-2 draw, with Brentford grabbing a point thanks to a last-gasp equaliser from Fabio Carvalho who had only been introduced to the game as a substitute a few moments earlier. The other goals in the game came from Kevin Schade, Cole Palmer and Moises Caicedo.\n\nChelsea were without top performers Reece James and Cole Palmer last night in their defeat to Arsenal, but Rosenior is hopeful they’ll return in time for this weekend. In his pre-match press conference he stated that “both of them are training today, so we just need to assess them after training and make sure they both come through all the protocols…but it’ll be great to have them both back in the squad, and at the moment it looks like they could be.”\n\nThe Blues will, however, be without Jamie Gittens and Liam Delap as they continue to recover from illness, along with some members of the Chelsea backroom staff.\n\nWith some fans and media deeming him to be at fault for Arsenal’s opener in the Carabao Cup, Liam Rosenior has issued no reassurances that Robert Sanchez will be his starting goalkeeper come this weekend. “I’m here to assess every position, I don’t have number ones and number two’s, that’s not how I work,” he explained.\n\nKickoff at Stamford Bridge is scheduled for 3pm GMT on Saturday 17th January, so the match will not be televised in the UK.",

    "description": "In Mansion House speech, mayor will talk of opportunities technology offers but highlight mass unemployment risk",
    "fullText": "In Mansion House speech, mayor will talk of opportunities technology offers but highlight mass unemployment risk\n\nSadiq Khan is to warn in a major speech that artificial intelligence (AI) could destroy swathes of jobs in London and “usher in a new era of mass unemployment” unless ministers act now.\n\nIn his annual Mansion House speech, the London mayor will say the capital is “at the sharpest edge of change” because of its reliance on white-collar workers in the finance and creative industries, and professional services such as law, accounting, consulting and marketing.\n\nThe mayor will argue that “we have a moral, social and economic duty to act” to ensure that new jobs are created to replace those that will disappear, with entry-level and junior jobs the first to go.\n\nIn the speech on Thursday night, Khan will highlight research that suggests 70% of skills in the average job will have changed by 2030.\n\nHowever, he also sees huge potential benefits from AI for public services and productivity across the economy.\n\nWhen he addresses business leaders and bankers at Mansion House, the London mayor will say: “AI could enable us to transform our public services, turbocharge productivity and tackle some of our most complex challenges,” but used recklessly, will “usher in a new era of mass unemployment”. He will warn that the impact on the labour market will be “nothing short of colossal”.\n\nBut he will say that there is a clear choice: “seize the potential of AI and use it as a superpower for positive transformation and creation or surrender to it and sit back and watch as it becomes a weapon of mass destruction of jobs.”\n\nCity Hall is launching a London taskforce on AI and the future of work, with expertise from the government, businesses and the AI sector, to assess the potential impact of the new technology on London’s jobs market. It will also offer free AI training for Londoners.\n\nMore than half of workers in London expect AI to affect their jobs in some way in the next 12 months, according to City Hall polling.\n\nAcross the UK, up to 3m low-skilled jobs in trades, machine operations and admin roles could disappear by 2035 because of automation and AI, a report by the charity National Foundation for Educational Research found in November.\n\n“We can shape this next technological revolution and, if we are bold in our efforts, ensure AI makes us richer, not poorer, stronger, not weaker, more connected and more confident, and more capable of building a fairer, safer and more prosperous London for everyone,” Khan will say.\n\nHe will argue the UK and others have been too slow to respond to new technology in the past and that the growth of social media has led to a youth mental health crisis, a surge in online abuse and a dangerous rise in misinformation.\n\nSeparately, Susan Langley, major of the City of London, said on Thursday morning she had noticed that some finance workers were wary of coming to London from abroad because they worry about their safety.\n\nHowever, she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The City of London is one of the safest cities in the world. There’s this perception that you’re going to step out of your office and be swept away in a tsunami of crime.\n\n“It’s completely wrong. Competition for investment is really fierce at the moment, and I think any kind of unfounded negative sentiment that’s being pushed out there really risks undermining the UK on the global stage, and we just can’t let it happen.”",

First of all, on the pitch, what have you made of what you’ve seen in the first half of the season?\n\nIt has been disappointing, in truth. There has not been any progress from last season, which is always disappointing to see.\n\nChelsea have been too inconsistent. They are able to get themselves up for the games against the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool and Barcelona, but have dropped too many points to sides they should be beating.\n\nOn New Year’s Day, Enzo Maresca left after 18 months in charge at Stamford Bridge. Relationships behind the scenes appeared fraught in the lead up to his departure, so did it come as a surprise, in any way?\n\nIn the end, it was not too much of a surprise, given how quickly Enzo Maresca’s relationship with the club deteriorated. But if you were to take it back a month before his departure, then it would come as a big shock.\n\nAs soon as Maresca came out with the “worst 48 hours” comment, it appeared to be the start of the end for the former head coach.\n\nLiam Rosenior has been appointed as the Italian’s successor on a deal running until the summer of 2032. What has the response been like to his arrival from Strasbourg?\n\nA lot of the Chelsea supporters were upset to see Maresca leave, and that has led to discontent over how the club is being run.\n\nThere does not seem to be a problem with Liam Rosenior, though, and supporters chanted his name after the win at Charlton Athletic in the FA Cup last weekend.\n\nHowever, he does face a big task - as any incoming Chelsea head coach does - of winning the supporters over.\n\n'Rosenior faces a big task - as any incoming Chelsea head coach does - of winning the supporters over'\n\nWhich player should Brentford be keeping an eye on on Saturday?\n\nLiam Delap has been in good form recently. It has been a slow start to life at Stamford Bridge for Chelsea’s new no.9 but, in recent matches, he has looked a lot sharper.\n\nHe has a history with Rosenior - having played under him during a loan spell at Hull in 2023/24 - which will help him.\n\nIf he starts on Saturday, then he could cause some problems for Brentford’s defenders. He is a real nuisance.\n\nWhat should Keith Andrews’ men expect from the Blues in terms of shape and style?\n\nNothing too dissimilar to how Maresca set up. Rosenior likes to play a 4-2-3-1 formation, but that shape quickly changes to almost a 3-2-2-3 when Chelsea have the ball.\n\nOne of the full-backs, usually the left-back, will advance up the pitch and slot into one of the no.10 roles.\n\nRosenior is trying to make the Blues more intense, but in terms of possession, he wants his side to be controlled and patient in their build-up.\n\nThere have been three draws and one Chelsea win in the last four meetings. What’s your score prediction this time around?\n\nBrentford are in really good form, so it will be tricky for Chelsea. This season, this type of game has proved difficult for the Blues.\n\nHowever, with it being Rosenior’s first league match, he will be desperate to get off to a good start. I expect Chelsea to win, but not comfortably.",

    "description": "An away trip to the East End of London was not always the most welcoming of prospects, but this game offered a little bit of everything that makes football such an experience in the broadest sense!",
    "fullText": "The 1977/78 season had not quite gone to plan for Jimmy Adamson. The unbelievable run-in to the previous season as we attempted to preserve our hard-won top-tier status – though in the end unsuccessful – had left many of us feeling we were only a couple of players away from having a squad good enough to return to the First Division at the first time of asking.\n\nFor the best part of the season our inability to put together successive victories as well as win away from Roker Park was a perplexing fact of this campaign. On a personal level being a regular at away games as well as Roker Park was a resilience- and stamina-building experience that has served me well into my older years as victories turned into draws and draws turned into defeats on the road!\n\nOrient were the opposition and Brisbane Road the venue as we ventured into 1978. I loved an away trip to London and Inter-City from Central Station was one of the more pleasurable modes of transport to a game (certainly knocking bells out of sitting on a crate in the back of a white van). Getting across London to whichever ground we were going to was the risky element of such trips but it all seemed worth it at the time and we were not to be disappointed on this occasion.\n\nGames against Orient I had generally found entertaining affairs. An added ingredient in this current Orient team was the marvellously talented winger John Chiedozie. Young, pacey, elusive and with a really good temperament the Nigerian international was a player to covet.\n\nHe also was one of the few wingers I saw regularly trouble one of my favourite ever full-backs Joe Bolton. I had been looking forward to seeing Joe pit his defensive wit and ferocious ability to put a flyer into the paddock if required before realising the day before the game that my cult hero was suspended and another handy youngster Tim Gilbert would take his place.\n\nOrient were no one-man team though and their manager Jimmy Bloomfield usually had them playing attractive attacking football. The leading goal-scorer in the second tier at that point was Peter Kitchen on fourteen goals. A Sunderland legend Stan Anderson had warned us in the local press in the run-up to this game to ignore him at our peril. He had sold him to Orient as Doncaster manager and rated him as a real threat. Glen Roeder would also play in the centre of defence; he was a stylish defender whose pace, positional sense and ability to use the ball well out of defence had always caught my eye when we played against him. Eire international Tony Grealish was a handful in midfield and Derek Clarke would also be in the O’s line-up. He was one of the five footballing Clarke brothers who always intrigued me. His brother Allan had played for Leeds against us in the 1973 FA Cup final and was probably the most successful of the quintet.\n\nBobby Fisher also played for Orient and apart from my youthful mistake in thinking he was also a Grand Chess Master this lad was often the victim of some brutal racist abuse; he was mixed-race and Jewish and to their detriment this seemed to especially aggravate some of the less tolerant who watched football at that time. Apart from being a handy enough full-back Fisher did not let the bigots hold him back; after his career in football he went on to become a TV actor (as well as an anti-racist campaigner) appearing in shows like The Manageress, Space Precinct and Star Hunter. Good on him!\n\nSunderland had their difficulties coming into this game. Ever-present Jackie Ashurst had gone down with flu so a late call-up was sixteen-year-old Rob Hindmarch. Coming from Morpeth I was especially chuffed at this debut; Ashurst would be a miss but Rob was from Stannington just outside of Morpeth and we were claiming him as one of our own “Morpeth Gadgies”.\n\nAnother player missing would be Mick Docherty (who had played his way into my affections since his transfer from Man City the previous season); a persistent knee injury was troubling the versatile leader on the park. Thankfully Bobby Kerr was back in the fold and would have a really good game to mark his return. Young forward and recent signing Roly Gregoire was added to the squad for this game and would be an unused substitute.\n\nMy journey from King’s Cross to Brisbane Road was typically not without its moments as traversing the underground, avoiding roaming bands of West Ham and Chelsea hoodlums and not for the first time falling into the trap of thinking once you are at King’s Cross you are almost at your destination all melded into an experience that would have prepared me as a contestant in Race Across the World had I the inclination today!\n\nOur away support in London games was always bolstered by exiles and there was close to two thousand of us making a bit of a racket as the game approached kick-off.\n\nMuch to our amusement a dog had gotten onto the pitch and was doing a marvellous job evading stewards, police and club officials to such an extent I contemplated writing to Jimmy Adamson to suggest the mongrel would make a handy addition to our forward line options.\n\nThe game had no sooner kicked off than it was stopped by the referee. To my initial excitement it looked like referee Tom Reynolds had sent the O’s keeper John Jackson off! At this point in the campaign I was ready to pounce on any advantage for my team and whilst cheering the “sending off” I freely admit I had no idea why this was the case. However notwithstanding my errant sense of fair-play it eventually became clear it was Jackson’s blue jersey which was the problem for the referee; it was clashing with our blue away jersey. Jackson returned to the field resplendent in a more traditional keeper’s jersey and to the satisfaction of the referee. In almost six decades of watching my team I had never seen this happen before or since.\n\nWith the game finally underway we made a really good start. With Bobby Kerr, Shaun Elliott, Wilf Rostron and Gary Rowell controlling midfield and Rob Hindmarch policing the dangerman Kitchen to good effect we had the majority of possession and moved the ball about the park smartly.\n\nAround thirteen minutes in Grealish misfired a pass straight to Bobby Kerr who looked up and played Gary Rowell into space as he raced into the box. Whether it was Grealish or Fisher who up-ended Rowell was hard to see from my position but the referee had no doubts about what the tackle deserved and awarded a penalty.\n\nThe season had started with Jackie Ashurst the nominated penalty taker; he had a thunderous shot and had scored a penna’ against Orient in the game at Roker Park earlier in the season. Gary Rowell had taken over the role and I had watched him score a penalty in three successive games in December. He looked nerveless taking these awards and combined unerring accuracy with a bit of power and as he picked himself up from the turf I was already anticipating taking a deserved lead in this game.\n\nThere was nothing in his run-up prior to this penalty that was any different to his previous successful attempts or anything different to any subsequent penalties (and I saw a number of them) that would account for him squeaking the ball the wrong side of the post. It was disappointing but unbeknown to us at the time it would be his sole penalty miss of twenty-six taken in his Sunderland career as he wrote himself into our record books with the most successful conversion rate of 96% in front of Tony Towers and Billy Clunas.\n\nThe game progressed with Sunderland still dominating the ball and looking the most likely team to score. The only real danger was coming from Chiedozie who was giving Mick Henderson and Tim Gilbert a bit of trouble as he alternated down either flank.\n\nWe arrived at half-time with no score courtesy of a couple of canny saves from Barry Siddall and an excellent interception from Hindmarch who had not given Kitchen a sniff in the first forty-five minutes. Despite our penalty miss I felt we were still well into this game; we just needed to get a little bit more from our front two of Lee and Holden!\n\nFor those that watched our two lanky strikers play together it is fair to say that Mel Holden was an out-and-out centre-forward. Bob Lee on the other hand offered a bit of variety as he would often drift into the midfield areas sometimes dragging his marker with him creating space for the likes of Gary Rowell and Wilf Rostron to “ghost” into. Lee was very tidy on the ball and whilst I sometimes felt he lacked a bit of aggression for a “big fella” he had some really nice touches and was utilised in midfield during his time with Sunderland.\n\nWithin minutes of the restart Wilf Rostron had seen two attempts go mighty close. A lob just cleared the crossbar and had Jackson scrambling and an angled shot pulled a cracking save out of the over-worked keeper.\n\nOn sixty minutes O’s manager Jimmy Bloomfield tried to change the pattern of the game by bringing off Derek Clarke and sending on experienced utility player David Payne to try and shore up the midfield. It did produce a change; on sixty-two minutes we scored! A Bobby Kerr corner kick was pinged into the box and produced a mighty melee with all our big men (Lee, Holden, Hindmarch and Jeff Clarke) in the eighteen-yard box. The ball eventually arrived at Jeff Clarke’s right foot about seven yards out from the back post. Like a seasoned forward he smashed the ball into the goal for his first ever Sunderland goal. We deserved this lead and boy did we celebrate it!\n\nThe game continued with Sunderland looking more likely to add to their lead when on seventy-three minutes there ensued one of the most bonkers five minutes of football I might have ever seen!\n\nIt started with Peter Kitchen who for just about the only time in the game eluded Rob Hindmarch, slalomed round Jeff Clarke and ran the ball into our net past a stranded Siddall for the equaliser.\n\nA minute later Gary Rowell danced along the eighteen-yard line before placing a sharp well-directed shot (a typical Gary Rowell shot from outwith the box) that nestled into the corner of Jackson’s goal to retake the lead and give him his twelfth goal of the season as well as make up for his penalty miss.\n\nWe were still celebrating Rowell’s cracker when an Orient corner kick seemed to evade a host of bodies as it somehow got to our back post. Moving smartly in the O’s best player on the day Chiedozie tapped the ball into our net for the equaliser.\n\nIt was an incredible passage of play and it wasn’t finished yet as almost straight from the kick-off the ball worked its way through Elliott, Kerr and Rowell to Bob Lee approximately eight yards out. He absolutely hammered a shot that looked a certainty and had my arms aloft in the away end only for Jackson to pull off another cracking save.\n\nFor the last fifteen minutes we did everything but score as Kerr put a good shot just over the bar and Mel Holden executed a perfect scissors kick that just grazed the bar. Holden looked like the most graceful giraffe you ever saw doing ballet as he pivoted and leapt; it was astounding to behold!\n\nThen another fantastic passage of interplay saw Bobby Kerr zip a low cross into the box for Gary Rowell to meet it almost horizontally (a typical Gary Rowell diving header) that Jackson just got a fingertip to. It was a breathtaking finale as the game finished with Orient perhaps a tad lucky to get a share of the points.\n\nThe Lads had played really well but actually dropped a position to eleventh in an eventful game that saw Jeff Clarke score the first of his six goals for us in a highly regarded Sunderland career and Gary Rowell miss the only penalty of the twenty-six he took for Sunderland.\n\nAs for the young debutant and Morpeth Gadgie Rob Hindmarch went on to become Sunderland’s youngest ever captain at nineteen years old. He was a hard centre-half who had all the attributes of a top-class defender: good aerial strength, strong tackler, fairly quick across the grass and a good ability to clear his lines. He allied all these skills with a cracking attitude to the game and a real leader on the pitch. In 1978 he would earn five England Youth caps and go on to make one hundred and twenty-eight appearances for the Lads ninety-one of these in the top tier as he became an intrinsic part of the team and defence for five seasons.\n\nIn 1984 new Sunderland manager Lenny Ashurst decided he could do without the services of Hindmarch. It seemed a daft decision at the time and looks no better with the benefit of hindsight as he allowed him to go for free. Hindmarch signed for Derby and became something of a cult hero as he captained them to two successive promotions into the top tier. He then signed for Wolves in 1990 and was appointed club captain but only spent one season at Molineux.\n\nIt is a poignant fact that the Sunderland team that took the field at Orient in 1978 contained three young men that would see their lives cut short. Both Rob Hindmarch and Mel Holden were diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease. Mel Holden died in January 1981 aged twenty-six years and Rob Hindmarch in November 2002 aged forty-one. Both left a wife and young children. Tim Gilbert too would pass far too young in May 1995 aged thirty-six of a heart attack. Three fine players to have graced our colours on this day at Brisbane Road.\n\nDivision Two Date – 14.01.1978 Venue – Brisbane Road Attendance – 6,737\n\nGoalscorers – Clarke 62 mins; Kitchen 73 mins; Rowell 74 mins; Chiedozie 75 mins\n\nOrient – Jackson; Fisher; Roffey; Bennett; Hoadley; Roeder; Chiedozie; Gray; D Clarke (Payne 60 mins); Kitchen; Grealish.

    "fullText": "LONDON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Global oil trading houses have emerged as early winners in the race to control Venezuelan crude flows, getting ahead of U.S. energy majors wary of credit and legal risks and securing a potentially lucrative business opportunity in the country with the world's largest crude reserves.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said U.S. majors would invest billions of dollars in Venezuela to quickly rebuild its dilapidated oil sector following the U.S. ​capture of President Nicolas Maduro earlier in January. Trump met top oil executives at the White House on Friday as his administration outlines a long-term plan to raise $100 billion to boost Venezuelan oil output.\n\nThe first companies to secure any business in the wake ‌of the U.S. military action in Caracas, however, were Dutch-based trader Vitol and Singapore-headquartered peer Trafigura, rather than U.S. majors.\n\nThe U.S. government tapped the giant merchant houses because they were better suited to quickly get Venezuelan oil exports flowing again, four industry sources familiar with the negotiations said. That is the first order of business for Washington before reconstruction ‌can begin, so that revenue from exports under U.S. supervision can fund the government of interim President Delcy Rodriguez in Caracas.\n\n\"Securing and marketing the initial barrels of Venezuelan crude oil was done at record speed to benefit both the American and Venezuelan people,\" a White House official told Reuters.\n\nVenezuela relies on oil exports for revenue, and has been starved of those proceeds for about a month under a blockade Trump imposed as he raised pressure on Maduro.\n\nWashington and Caracas are finalizing a $2 billion deal to sell up to 50 million barrels of crude to U.S. refiners and other buyers - oil that had been stuck on ships in Venezuelan waters and in storage tanks because of the blockade.\n\nFacilitating the initial oil sales was critical to ensure funds could flow back into Venezuela for everyday services and a process is in place to maintain the steady flow of production, sales, and refining of Venezuelan crude oil, the ⁠White House official said.\n\nTrafigura and Vitol have secured preliminary special licenses to negotiate and export the ‌Venezuelan crude, and Trafigura is set to load its first cargo this week, Chief Executive Richard Holtum said at the White House meeting with Trump.\n\nGLOBAL NETWORK ADDED TO TRADERS' APPEAL\n\nThe trading houses competed with Chevron to secure the supply deals. Chevron is the only U.S. oil major that operates in Venezuela, as a minority partner in joint ventures with Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA. Chevron has a license from U.S. authorities, which exempts it from ‍the sanctions the United States had imposed to choke off oil revenues to Maduro.",

    "fullText": "West Ham United’s January search for survival has taken a familiar turn towards north London. According to the Daily Mail, the Hammers have now “made contact with Tottenham Hotspur about a January move to sign goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky”, a development that reflects both urgency and uncertainty at the London Stadium.\n\nThis has been a bruising campaign. West Ham sit seven points adrift of safety, already having parted company with Graham Potter, while Nuno Espirito Santo now finds himself under mounting pressure. The Daily Mail report makes clear that the Portuguese coach views the winter window as a final lifeline, with a goalkeeper identified as a priority.\n\nEspirito Santo, himself a former FC Porto stopper, understands the psychological weight of that position. When confidence drains from the back, results often follow.\n\nWest Ham have already acted to address their lack of goals, completing deals for Pablo and Taty Castellanos. Attention has now shifted to damage limitation. Too many goals conceded, too many leads squandered, and too many afternoons defined by defensive uncertainty.\n\nThe Daily Mail state that “West Ham have now made contact with London rivals Tottenham over a potential move to sign Czech Republic international Kinsky this month.” The 22 year old arrived at Spurs in January 2025 under Ange Postecoglou, initially deputising during Guglielmo Vicario’s injury absence.\n\nThat early exposure brought promise, but opportunity soon vanished.\n\nOnce Vicario returned to fitness, the hierarchy reasserted itself. Under Thomas Frank, Kinsky has made just two appearances this season, both in the Carabao Cup, and “keeping two clean sheets in the process.” For a young goalkeeper, that is both a reminder of his quality and a frustration at his limited pathway.\n\nTottenham’s position is pragmatic. Vicario remains first choice, and squad balance matters. A loan or permanent move could suit all parties, particularly if minutes are guaranteed elsewhere.\n\nWest Ham’s recent missteps have been highlighted. The club spent around £20m on Mads Hermansen last summer, only for the Dane to concede “14 goals in his first four appearances” before losing his place to Alphonse Areola. Now, “Nuno has made it clear to him that he has no future at the club”, leaving West Ham scrambling once more.\n\nAreola has not disgraced himself, yet results continue to slide. As the report notes, “While Areola hasn’t particularly done anything wrong this season, he can’t stop conceding goals.” In a relegation battle, perception becomes reality.\n\nKinsky is described as “phenomenal”, and while that label carries optimism rather than proof, desperation sharpens decision making. The defence has been fragile, but goalkeepers often become the final line of belief.\n\nTottenham may be open to a deal given Kinsky’s lack of involvement, and the player himself would likely welcome a chance to play regularly. With weeks remaining in the window, this feels like a situation driven by necessity rather than luxury.\n\nFor West Ham supporters, this report rings with uncomfortable familiarity. Another January, another scramble, another attempt to fix deep structural problems with short term solutions. Yet the interest in Kinsky makes sense. Fans understand that survival sometimes requires calculated risk.\n\nKinsky’s appeal lies in freshness. He arrives without baggage from this season’s struggles and with something to prove. Supporters may see him as a psychological reset as much as a tactical one. When confidence drains from the stands, a new face can change the mood.\n\nTottenham fans, meanwhile, are likely indifferent but pragmatic. Kinsky is well regarded, but Vicario is established. Allowing a talented backup to gain minutes elsewhere could be sensible squad management, provided Spurs retain long term control.\n\nBoth fanbases will recognise the gamble. For West Ham, it is about hope and momentum. For Tottenham, it is about asset value and development. In a relegation fight, those motivations can align briefly, even between rivals.",

    "title": "I moved in with my girlfriend in London after only a few months of dating. I was terrified.",
    "description": "I was used to living on my own in a small town, but my new girlfriend and I decided to move to London together. I worried we'd lose our spark.",
    "fullText": "I met an incredible woman on a random outing to London while I was living life in slow motion, alone in a quiet English seaside town.\n\nI fell in love in a way that surprised me, both in its speed and its certainty. I knew it was her. The relationship unfolded across train rides, weekends, and the growing realization that what I thought was a temporary chapter in my life was quietly becoming its center.\n\nAfter a few months together, a practical question emerged. Our rent contracts were ending. Suddenly, there was an opportunity to do something that felt both thrilling and reckless: move in together and move back to London after years in a small town.\n\nIt felt risky, especially after years of living alone and so soon after meeting. But it also felt like an invitation to fully embrace a new chapter abroad, without half-measures.\n\nMy fear wasn't about commitment in the abstract. It was far more mundane and, in some ways, more unsettling: I didn't know if I actually knew how to live with someone.\n\nI had lived with my parents and sisters in Mexico, and I also had roommates during my student exchange in Spain, but that was a long time ago. Ever since leaving my country to see what life had to offer, I had lived entirely on my own.\n\nLiving alone abroad had sharpened my sense of independence. I had my routines, my rhythms, and my silence. Sharing a space meant renegotiating all of that in a city as intense as London — while also being a foreigner still figuring out where I belonged, and doing it with someone I was still getting to know.\n\nI worried about losing the version of myself I had worked hard to build over the past two years. I worried about friction, mismatched habits, and what happens when two people bring different expectations into the same kitchen, the same mornings, and the same tired evenings.\n\nStaying separate felt equally wrong, though. At some point, I had to give it a real chance.\n\nOnce we made the decision, another fear surfaced, one I hadn't said out loud at first. I worried that moving in together would flatten the magic of the relationship.\n\nDating, especially in the early stages, allows for a certain level of curation. You see each other rested, excited, and intentional. Living together removes that buffer almost immediately. There are no intermissions, no reset between interactions.\n\nI worried the romance would dissolve into logistics. That excitement would be replaced by grocery lists, chores, and bad habits. What if the softness of the early months would harden under the weight of constant proximity?\n\nIt felt like skipping too far ahead in the story. I wondered if we were rushing something that deserved more time to breathe. What if she realized I wasn't what she hoped for? What if our energies didn't align? What if it was simply too much?\n\nBut I learned that the honeymoon phase doesn't end because of shared space. It ends when curiosity stops. Living together, as it turned out, demanded more curiosity, not less.\n\nThe shift was immediate, but not in the way I expected. Living together didn't make things smaller. It made them deeper.\n\nWe learned from each other in unglamorous but essential ways: how we start our mornings, how we decompress after long days, and how we navigate stress without turning it into conflict. The relationship became less performative and more real.\n\nLiving with my girlfriend allowed me to truly know her, not just the version of her that appears on dates. I saw her patience, her habits, her quiet moments, and her resilience. I learned how she shows care when no one is watching.\n\nIn that process, I also learned more about myself. I realized that independence doesn't disappear when you share a life with someone. It evolves. Living together abroad didn't shrink my world; it expanded it.\n\nI've lived in many places and many houses, but this is the first time I can say that, with her, it feels like home.",

    "fullText": "A significant chunk of Chinese copper demand has all but evaporated after the metal’s stunning surge to record levels.\n\nCopper on the London Metal Exchange burst through $13,000 a ton for the first time this week, extending its rally to nearly 50% over the past year. A cocktail of bullish factors could drive prices even higher over the short term. While real-world buyers typically take time to adjust to such sharp increases, what’s notable in this case is the extent to which industrial users in the biggest market are scaling back purchases.\n\nNYC Fights Sale of Bankrupt Rentals After Mamdani Blasts Living Conditions\n\nNew Design Plans Revealed for White House Ballroom\n\nWe Still Don’t Know if Robotaxis Are Safer Than Human Drivers\n\nNew LA Home Designs, Reimagined By Fire\n\nSlowing the Spread of Urban Fires Starts Right Outside the Home\n\n“It is surprising how much price rejection is taking place. The Chinese are just not buying copper, it’s true,” Kostas Bintas, head of metals at trading giant Mercuria Energy Group Ltd., said in an interview. “But it’s finite — at some point you need to buy.”\n\nSluggish physical demand contrasts with the speculative frenzy lifting futures markets, where deep-pocketed funds are responding to tighter global supply, favorable interest rates and an impulse to hedge geopolitical turmoil by stockpiling commodities. The copper contract in Shanghai, which accounts for import costs, topped 100,000 yuan a ton ($14,300) for the first time at the end of December.\n\nChinese industry, though, accounts for half of global copper demand. The fabricators that shape the metal — into wires, sheets and pipes for power cables, circuit boards and plumbing systems — are struggling to pass on their higher costs to factories. As inventories build, the smelters that refine copper in the first instance are trying to export their surplus.\n\nRecord copper prices “had a significant impact in December,” said Hai Jianxun, a sales executive at Henan Yuxing Copper Co. in central China, which makes pipes for items like air-conditioners. “The overall market was very quiet — much quieter than in previous years.”\n\nA Mysteel Global survey covering most suppliers showed that about 60% of the firms making copper rod for electricity transmission, a category that accounts for around half of China’s copper goods, cut or shut production over the month because of mounting costs.\n\nFees to process refined copper into rod fell to zero this week, Mysteel said, the lowest-ever level for the time of the year.\n\nThe subdued activity isn’t an anomaly. Even during the autumn, when demand typically peaks, operating rates across fabricators were at multiyear lows for the season. Ultimately, the market is paying the price of the economy’s lackluster recovery from the pandemic and structurally weaker growth.",

    "description": "The manager was seen holding a cup bearing the club crest of Tottenham’s bitter north London rivals",
    "fullText": "Thomas Frank has defended himself after a picture emerged of the Tottenham manager holding an Arsenal-branded coffee cup before Spurs’ defeat by Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium on Wednesday evening.\n\nFrank walked around the pitch before kick-off holding the cup, which displayed the club crest of Tottenham’s bitter north London rivals.\n\nLeaders Arsenal were the previous visitors to the Vitality Stadium, having celebrated a 3-2 success at the ground on Saturday.\n\n“I definitely didn’t notice it,” Frank said of the cup. “I think it’s fair to say we’re not winning every single football match so it would be absolutely, completely stupid of me to take a cup with Arsenal’s (emblem on).\n\n“They have been in the changing room the game before us. It’s normal to take a cup, give me an espresso, I do that before every game, so I think actually it’s a little bit sad in football that I need to be asked a question about that.\n\n“We’re definitely going in the wrong direction if we need to be worry about me having a cup with a logo of another club. Of course I would never do that. That’s extremely stupid.”\n\nThe Dane's unfortunate gaffe sparked outrage among sections of Spurs' disgruntled fanbase after pictures circulated on social media. Further pressure was piled on Frank as Antoine Semenyo bid a likely farewell to Bournemouth by firing home a dramatic added-time winner.\n\nJoao Palhinha’s bicycle kick looked set to earn Frank a reprieve after first-half goals from Bournemouth duo Evanilson and Junior Kroupi overturned Mathys Tel's early opener. But Cherries star Semenyo, who is on the verge of a £65m move to Manchester City, smashed home his 10th goal of the season in the fifth minute of added time.\n\nThe loss left Tottenham with just two wins from their last 12 top-flight games and prompted heated exchanges between travelling fans and players at full-time.\n\n“I think it’s fair to say everyone involved in Tottenham, it’s a tough one to take today,” said Frank. “Hopefully everyone can see how hard we worked to get everything in the right direction.\n\n“Overall the performance was good, especially the second half, in a game where we deserved to get more. That is extremely painful to be part of, so of course people are frustrated - that’s natural. It’s very tough to sit here right now and we haven’t got anything out of overall a good performance.”",

    "description": "Lee Morrison looks at the main points from a night to forget in London - a 3-0 humbling from Brentford.",
    "fullText": "Early signs showed that Brentford were direct and keen to punish any misplaced passes. We could see quite early on that Sunderland were being given much more time on the ball compared to the Spurs game.\n\nIn the first ten minutes it did seem like we were slightly lackadaisical at times with our passing from defence and midfield, leading to some quick breaks. Thankfully Brentford were not able to take advantage. With so many games in such a short space of time – and with so many of our first team missing – it’s natural that more mistakes would creep in as tiredness and fatigue hit.\n\nAfter the first ten minutes you could see visible improvements as we ramped up the pressure on Brentford with a high press. One common thread in the analysis of our games has been praising the press and how well drilled the team are. This was no different in the first half and start of the second, with mistakes starting to be made in more advanced areas from our opposition. There were also some early signs that our long throw-ins from Mukiele were causing confusion – one in particular where Kelleher was fortunate to get a free-kick for dropping the ball…\n\nWatching Brian Brobbey lead the line, you can’t help but be impressed by the strength and determination that he demonstrates. His hold-up play is superb, along with the intelligence of the runs that he provides. It was a shame that we didn’t take advantage of these runs and the opportunities they present.\n\nThe only thing that is particularly frustrating to see is the lack of protection that he gets from referees and officials. We keep seeing instances where centre-backs are climbing all over Brobbey and clearly committing fouls, but we don’t get the decision as he doesn’t fall to the floor. It’s embarrassing to think that we need to either tell Brobbey to pretend to be more impacted in order to get decisions in his favour or rely upon blatantly obvious fouls to occur, such as the penalty incident.\n\nI don’t have many words to express what we witnessed with that penalty. It was simply a truly awful, baffling decision that should never have been made when we were in a losing position. We all know what it led to, and you can only hope that it’s something that the team learns from.\n\nDespite this though, knee-jerk reactions like those demanding that Le Fée was taken off immediately are hardly helpful. Taking off your most creative player when 1-0 down is not going to help our cause, regardless of how annoying the decision itself was.\n\nWhilst Brobbey was making some excellent runs and holding the ball up well, there was a lack of support evident from midfield. It seemed that Régis Le Bris was suitably unimpressed with our wing play, making changes just after the 50-minute mark. Although there are some encouraging signs of a partnership forming between Mayenda and Brobbey, I am left feeling that some players haven’t really taken advantage of the chances that AFCON has provided.\n\nRomaine Mundle snatched at some chances that at this level have to be taken advantage of. Likewise we’ve seen inconsistent performances from Simon Adingra which have helped demonstrate why he hasn’t been a regular starter despite his potential.\n\nFrom a defensive standpoint we have often debated on who the best back four would be. I wouldn’t be surprised to see Trai Hume dropped for the next game, with the ideal defence consisting of Mukiele, Ballard, Alderete (though he had a shocker today), and Reinildo.\n\nThe FA Cup game comes at a really interesting point in the season. For me it’s a chance for players to get some much-needed rest and for us to prepare for the next Premier League game. It’s also a perfect opportunity for our AFCON contingent to start returning from the tournament and get back into the swing of things.\n\nAs much as I, like many others, would love to see a successful cup run, I can’t help but feel that this would be something better suited to next season. For now the focus should be on simply trying to finish in the highest position possible in the league table and taking advantage of the fantastic start that we have had.\n\nFinally, I think it’s always worth ending with some perspective. Yes, the performance was poor. Yes, the penalty resembled something that you see from those horrendous TikTok streamers on FIFA, but ultimately we’re on 30 points with 21 games played. One thing we’ve always seen is how Régis Le Bris and the team have learned from bad experiences, and this should be no different.",

    "fullText": "WSL Full-Time were informed of the news via an official club press release from Blues this morning.\n\nThe 21-year-old Finnish international attacker has spent the last two years with London City Lionesses but her progress has been severely impacted by an Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury. The player sustained her long-term injury early last season and she was unable to play a significant part in The Pride’s Barclays WSL2 title success. Lindström has since returned to fitness, although her game time in the Barclays Women’s Super League has been limited.\n\nThe forward has plenty of potential but she needs regular playing minutes to develop. She will now hope to get some valuable experience in her time back in the second tier with Birmingham City.\n\nAfter joining Blues, Lindström said “I’m really excited to be here and get started with the team.\n\n“I think it’s a really nice club with big ambitions and I want to be part of achieving those goals the club have set.”\n\nLindström is Birmingham City’s second signing of the January transfer window.",

    "description": "Ethan Spibey, 33, quit his director-level job in London to move to Barcelona, where he runs his own business. He asked himself: \"if not now, when?\"",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ethan Spibey, 33, a consultant who lives in Barcelona. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nTwice a month, I commute from Barcelona to London: landing at around 10 a.m. on Tuesday morning and catching the 6 p.m. flight back on Wednesday.\n\nIt sounds like a hassle, but waking up in one of the world's most amazing cities instead of an unremarkable London suburb is worth an extra hour or two of commuting each month.\n\nI spent a year in Barcelona in 2013 while studying economics and Spanish as part of my four-year degree in the UK. I loved everything about the city: the food, the culture, the beaches. Plus, it's relatively affordable, the people are beautiful, and the weather is amazing. I knew it was only a matter of time before I went back.\n\nAfter I graduated in 2014 and started my career in London, I returned to Barcelona almost every year.\n\nIt showed me how easy the journeys were and that commuting between the UK and Spain was viable. There were multiple flights a day, and return tickets typically cost around £60 ($80) compared to £130 ($174) for my monthly railcard in London.\n\nLife is also much better value in Barcelona than in London. At the restaurant beneath our apartment, it is hard to spend more than £35 on a meal for two, and coffees cost roughly half what we paid in London.\n\nBut years passed, and I still hadn't made the move.\n\nI don't plan to have children, so I didn't have the usual excuses for choosing stability over risk.\n\nAside from my husband and family, striving for independence was the thing that mattered to me most. Relocating to another country felt like the single most independent — and thrilling — thing I could do with my life.\n\nIn the summer of 2024, my husband and I committed to moving to Barcelona.\n\nThen came the question of what to do about work.\n\nAs a self-employed stock trader, my husband could work from anywhere. I knew I couldn't move to Barcelona with my job because of their policies and the tax implications. That left me with two options: finding a new role with a Spanish employer or starting my own business.\n\nQuitting my job and launching a UK-based consultancy while living mostly in Spain felt exciting and made the most sense, because I could still leverage my UK-based network.\n\nAt the end of 2024, I left my job and launched Born Advisory, a communications business that provides bespoke training to CEOs to help them connect more effectively with people through interviews and public speaking. I named it Born Advisory, after my favourite neighbourhood in Barcelona, El Born.\n\nGetting a visa was slow but straightforward because I'm married to a German and therefore qualified for a spousal visa. Because Germany and Spain are both in the European Union, citizens can live and work freely across member states. Without that route, I would have needed an entrepreneurial or digital nomad visa, both of which are harder to secure.\n\nMy visa was approved in 2025 after more than six months of waiting.\n\nWhen I travel to London for meetings, I usually stay with friends, but I can also book a budget hotel room for about £100 when necessary. As a business expense, it's negligible.\n\nThe mental health benefits far outweigh any cost or inconvenience. The opportunity to recalibrate my life was far more important to me than the stability and predictability of a job.\n\nMy clients say they are very happy with me, and I think that's because I'm so much more personally invested in my work than I was when I was just taking home a salary.\n\nUltimately, in 2024, I asked myself, \"If not now, when?\" You can make excuses for years, but life is short. I'm glad I eventually made the decision to relocate.\n\nThis is the first time I've taken absolute responsibility for what I want to do with my life — and it has turned out to be the most refreshing and invigorating decision I've ever made.",

    "fullText": "The Vitality Stadium prepares for another high-profile North London visit on Wednesday night as Bournemouth host a stuttering Tottenham Hotspur side.\n\nAndoni Iraola’s men enter the midweek fixture looking to snap an 11-match winless streak. Unfortunately, this represents the longest barren run in the club’s history. Despite a spirited performance against Arsenal, a 3-2 defeat left the Cherries in 15th place.\n\nNow, they face a Tottenham team led by Thomas Frank. However, the manager faces mounting pressure following recent poor results. Recently, a goalless draw at Brentford followed a “painful” 1-1 home stalemate against Sunderland. Currently, the Lilywhites sit 13th, just four points ahead of their hosts. Therefore, Spurs arrive in Bournemouth knowing the high stakes involved. Crucially, dropped points could see them slide down a congested mid-table. This follows Chelsea’s dramatic 1-1 draw at Manchester City on Sunday. Consequently, the European places remain highly competitive.\n\nDate: Wednesday, 7 January 2026\n\nVenue: Vitality Stadium, Bournemouth\n\nLast Meeting: Tottenham Hotspur 0–1 Bournemouth, 30 August 2025\n\nUnfortunately, the Cherries suffered a major blow regarding Justin Kluivert. Specifically, the forward requires surgery on a left knee injury sustained against Arsenal. Now, he joins a lengthy injury list alongside Tyler Adams, Ryan Christie, and Ben Gannon-Doak.\n\nPositively, teenage defender Veljko Milosavljević returned to training. Currently, he ranks as the closest long-term absentee to a return. Surprisingly, Antoine Semenyo expects to be available for his potential final appearance. This comes despite an agreed £65m move to Manchester City.\n\nRegrettably, Thomas Frank confirmed that star winger Mohammed Kudus “most likely” misses out. This follows a thigh injury he sustained against Sunderland. Worryingly, the recent sale of Brennan Johnson compounds this absence. Consequently, Spurs look thin on the right flank.\n\nHowever, Xavi Simons becomes available for selection again. Notably, he returns after serving a three-match suspension. Meanwhile, Dominic Solanke, James Maddison, and Dejan Kulusevski remain out. Additionally, the Africa Cup of Nations claims Yves Bissouma and Pape Matar Sarr.\n\nCurrently, Bournemouth struggle with midweek woes. Specifically, they remain winless in their last seven Premier League games played midweek. However, the Cherries have the chance to complete a historic league double over Tottenham. This follows their 1-0 win in North London earlier this season. Remarkably, they proved themselves as entertainers this term. In fact, they scored at least twice in eight games they failed to win. Finally, teenager Junior Kroupi remains a bright spot. Currently, he leads all teenagers in the league with six goals.\n\nSpurs are also on a 10-match winless midweek run, a record Thomas Frank will be desperate to break. Despite their overall inconsistency, the Lilywhites have shown impressive road resilience, keeping five clean sheets in 10 away games this season—more than they managed in the entirety of the 2024-25 campaign. A tactical shift is evident under Frank; Tottenham are averaging just 9.9 shots per game, the first time they have averaged fewer than 11 per match since records began in 1997.\n\nBournemouth predicted XI: Petrovic; Jimenez, Hill, Senesi, Truffert; Tavernier, Scott; Semenyo, Cook, Brooks; Evanilson\n\nTottenham Hotspur predicted XI: Vicario; Spence, Romero, Van de Ven, Davies; Gray, Bentancur; Simons, Bergvall, Tel; Richarlison\n\nIn the UK, the match will be broadcast live on Sky Sports Golf, with coverage starting at 18:00 GMT ahead of the 19:30 kick-off.\n\nRead more- Semenyo medical booked as Man City eye next transfer target\n\nSee Also- Enzo Maresca breaks silence on Chelsea exit with farewell message\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "LONDON (AP) — Auschwitz survivor Eva Schloss, the stepsister of teenage diarist Anne Frank and a tireless educator about the horrors of the Holocaust, has died. She was 96.\n\nThe Anne Frank Trust UK, of which Schloss was honorary president, said she died Saturday in London, where she lived.\n\nBritain’s King Charles III said he was “privileged and proud” to have known Schloss, who co-founded the charitable trust to help young people challenge prejudice.\n\n“The horrors that she endured as a young woman are impossible to comprehend and yet she devoted the rest of her life to overcoming hatred and prejudice, promoting kindness, courage, understanding and resilience through her tireless work for the Anne Frank Trust UK and for Holocaust education across the world,” the king said.\n\nBorn Eva Geiringer in Vienna in 1929, Schloss fled with her family to Amsterdam after Nazi Germany annexed Austria. She became friends with another Jewish girl of the same age, Anne Frank, whose diary would become one of the most famous chronicles of the Holocaust.\n\nLike the Franks, Eva's family spent two years in hiding to avoid capture after the Nazis occupied the Netherlands. They were eventually betrayed, arrested and sent to the Auschwitz death camp.\n\nSchloss and her mother Fritzi survived until the camp was liberated by Soviet troops in 1945. Her father Erich and brother Heinz died in Auschwitz.\n\nAfter the war, Eva moved to Britain, married German Jewish refugee Zvi Schloss and settled in London.\n\nIn 1953, her mother married Frank’s father, Otto, the only member of his immediate family to survive. Anne Frank died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp at the age of 15, months before the end of the war.\n\nSchloss did not speak publicly about her experiences for decades, later saying that wartime trauma had made her withdrawn and unable to connect with others.\n\n“I was silent for years, first because I wasn’t allowed to speak. Then I repressed it. I was angry with the world,” she told The Associated Press in 2004.\n\nBut after she addressed the opening of an Anne Frank exhibition in London in 1986, Schloss made it her mission to educate younger generations about the Nazi genocide. Over the following decades she spoke in schools and prisons, at international conferences and told her story in books including “Eva’s Story: A Survivor’s Tale by the Stepsister of Anne Frank.”\n\nShe kept campaigning into her 90s. In 2019, she traveled to Newport Beach, California to meet teenagers who were photographed making Nazi salutes at a high school party. The following year she was part of a campaign urging Facebook to remove Holocaust-denying material from the social networking site.\n\n“We must never forget the terrible consequences of treating people as ‘other,’” Schloss said in 2024. “We need to respect everybody’s races and religions. We need to live together with our differences. The only way to achieve this is through education, and the younger we start the better.”\n\nSchloss’ family remembered her as “a remarkable woman: an Auschwitz survivor, a devoted Holocaust educator, tireless in her work for remembrance, understanding and peace.”\n\n“We hope her legacy will continue to inspire through the books, films and resources she leaves behind,” the family said in a statement.\n\nZvi Schloss died in 2016. Eva Schloss is survived by their three daughters, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren.",

    "fullText": "London predicted to be the first UK city to go diesel-free, largely because of the ultra-low emission zone\n\nBattery electric cars are poised to overtake diesels on Great Britain’s roads by 2030, according to analysis that suggests London will be the first UK city to go diesel-free.\n\nThe number of diesel cars on Great Britain’s roads in June had fallen to 9.9m in June last year, 21% below its peak of 12.4m vehicles, according to analysis by New AutoMotive, a thinktank focused on the transition to electric cars. Electric car sales are still growing rapidly, albeit more slowly than manufacturers had expected.\n\nHowever, the transition to cleaner vans is lagging behind cars, and the number of diesel vans has continued to rise, to a record 4.4m.\n\nThe UK went through a “dash for diesel” cars in the 2000s as the government granted them cheaper tax rates. Diesel engines tend to be more efficient than petrol engines, burning less fuel and producing less carbon dioxide.\n\nHowever, they also produce more nitrous oxides, which are harmful to health. In 2015 Volkswagen was found to have created software to cheat on emissions tests, kicking off the “Dieselgate” scandal, costing it alone €30bn (£26bn) around the world in fines, compensation and legal costs. Analysis this year suggested the extra emissions from cheat devices from Volkswagen and other carmakers were responsible for thousands of deaths and cases of asthma.\n\nSales of cars with diesel engines duly plummeted, to fewer than 100,000 in the first 11 months of 2025. However, it will take some time for the share of diesel cars on the road to diminish, as many cars bought during the peak years of diesels are only now being scrapped.\n\nBattery electric cars made up only 4% of the cars on UK roads last year, compared with 32% diesels and 58% that use petrol, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), a lobby group. The other 6% were hybrids, which mostly combine a smaller battery with a petrol engine.\n\nNevertheless, the number of diesels should drop as older cars are scrapped, delivering benefits for towns and cities where particulates tend to be concentrated. That will also have a knock-on effect for filling stations, leading to many withdrawing diesel supplies.\n\nLondon is expected to be the first place in the UK where no diesel cars or vans are registered, largely because of the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), which applies charges for more polluting non-compliant cars. Diesel numbers are also dropping rapidly in the central belt of Scotland, which contains Edinburgh and Glasgow, both of which have low-emission zones.\n\n“Ending the use of diesel is essential to clean up Britain’s choking cities,” said Ben Nelmes, the chief executive of New AutoMotive. “The UK is now rolling out electric cars at a rapid pace, and this is great news for everyone that enjoys clean air, quieter streets and really cheap running costs.\n\n“The UK imports billions of pounds of diesel every year, and we have been completely reliant on other countries to feed our thirst. Thankfully, we’re switching to electric cars at a rapid rate, and that will make the country cleaner and wealthier.”\n\nHowever, the analysis found that people in cities appeared to be selling their diesels to people in more rural areas.\n\nThe report found that, while the number of diesel vans has risen over the past decade, the peak of new diesel van sales probably happened before the pandemic, meaning the numbers on roads will eventually fall.\n\nMatt Finch, an environmental policy expert who co-wrote the report, said the world was “leaving the diesel age”. He said: “No one is denying diesel hasn’t been useful, but it has had its day.”",

    "fullText": "Hailing app will now act as agent rather than supplier outside London, avoiding VAT requirement\n\nUber has swerved paying millions of pounds to the UK exchequer under Rachel Reeves’s new “taxi tax” after the ride-hailing app rewrote contracts with its drivers.\n\nThe move came as rules announced in November’s budget took effect, which adjusted how VAT is payable on minicab fares and would have resulted in the whole Uber fare becoming subject to the 20% sales tax.\n\nIn November, Reeves told the Commons the changes would end up “protecting around £700m of tax revenue each year”.\n\nHowever, updated terms issued to Uber drivers from January 2026 mean the technology firm will act as an agent, rather than as the supplier, of transport services outside London. The move means drivers make a contract directly with their passengers – so they must charge any VAT due on the fare, while Uber only adds VAT to its commission.\n\nAs most drivers are not thought to be making more than £90,000 in bookings a year, and therefore do not have to charge VAT, the majority of Uber fares outside London will avoid becoming more expensive, since the 20% sales tax will not apply.\n\nThe new contracts do not relate to London, where the agency model is not allowed under Transport for London rules. As a result, Uber passengers in the capital will pay VAT on their fares.\n\nUber’s change to the terms with its drivers has been expected since the budget announcement.\n\nAt the time, Andrew Brem, Uber’s regional general manager for the UK, said: “The government’s action today to change the rules will mean higher prices for passengers in London, and less work for drivers, when people are already struggling with the cost of living … This decision also establishes the absurd situation where a trip in London will be taxed at a different rate than a trip anywhere else in the UK.”\n\nAn HM Treasury spokesperson said: “Ending this use of a niche tax scheme by online minicab firms will both benefit everyday cabbies with a fairer tax system and raise money to help deliver the country’s priorities – cutting the cost of living, cutting waiting lists, and cutting debt and borrowing.”\n\nIt did not say if Uber’s changes would affect its estimate of “protecting” £700m a year of receipts from the new policy.",

    "fullText": "Deion Sanders loses another star player to the transfer portal originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWith less than 30 hours remaining before the transfer portal officially opens, Deion Sanders and the Colorado Buffaloes absorbed one of their most significant blows of the cycle.\n\nTrue freshman edge rusher London Merritt is moving on.\n\nThe timing alone made the loss sting. The substance made it heavier.\n\nMerritt didn’t redshirt. He didn’t wait for an opportunity. He played in all 12 games as a freshman, carving out a role in the rotation immediately. At 6-foot-3, 250 pounds, the Atlanta native finished the season with 25 total tackles, eight tackles for loss, and a sack, production that only hinted at the disruption he consistently created off the edge. He earned PFF All-Freshman honors and a Big 12 honorable mention, rare recognition for a first-year defender adjusting to Power Four football on the fly.\n\nMORE: Major shakeup hits Colorado’s quarterback room as transfer portal losses reach 23\n\nThis wasn’t a developmental flyer. Merritt was already a major part of the plan.\n\nThat made the reaction from inside the program impossible to ignore.\n\nCornerback Kole Mathis summed it up in two words, “Damn twin.” Defensive lineman Taurean Carter followed with, “Ohhhhh that’s a heartbreak.” Freshman quarterback Julian Lewis offered something quieter but more revealing, “Ts starting to hurt.”\n\nFormer Buff Tawfiq Byard, who recently entered the portal himself, added, “Love ya youngin.”\n\nMORE: Will Paul Skenes pay ‘six figures’ for one of a kind Livvy Dunne Topps autographed card\n\nThose reactions all appeared in the same place, the comments of Merritt’s own Instagram post. The news was first reported by Hayes Fawcett for On3, then shared directly by Merritt. This wasn’t secondhand churn or anonymous speculation. It was a player announcing his decision himself, with teammates processing it in real time underneath.\n\nThere’s also recruiting context that sharpens the loss. Before signing with Colorado last December, Merritt had been committed to the Ohio State Buckeyes. His flip to Boulder registered as a meaningful win at the time, a blue-chip edge prospect choosing opportunity and early playing time. One season later, that gamble had already paid off on the field.\n\nBetween NFL Draft declarations and the transfer portal, Coach Prime and the Buffaloes are now facing the task of replacing more than 30 student-athletes and counting.\n\nThe Buffaloes are losing a young, productive defender with size, validation, and upward trajectory, the exact type of player programs usually build around.\n\nWhile the portal hasn’t opened yet, the impact has already been felt in Boulder.\n\nKane Wommack says Alabama’s culture showed itself when the punches came\n\nCoach Prime reacts to Colorado defensive tackle’s concerning NFL Draft decision\n\nDeion Sanders faces harsh reality as Colorado talent floods the transfer portal\n\nHistoric first national championship sparks emotional reaction from Jamie Morrison and Aggies",

    "description": "Exclusive: Rail firm has offered £150 for a London hotel – but says contact centre will be pragmatic on claims",
    "fullText": "An estimated 25,000 Eurostar passengers had their travel plans torn up due to the closure of the Channel Tunnel for many hours on 30 December.\n\nThirty trains connecting London St Pancras International with Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam have been cancelled.\n\nServices have now resumed, but passengers have been told that unless they have a confirmed for one of the trains that are running, they should leave the station.\n\nEven though easyJet put on extra capacity between London and Paris, air fares have soared due to the mass cancellations. The cheapest British Airways flight on New Year’s Eve is £625.\n\nThousand of people are out of position. Unfortunately for those travellers, care and compensation rules for international rail travellers are far less comprehensive and generous than for airline passengers.\n\nThese are the key questions and answers about rail passengers’ rights.\n\n“Following the suspension services of services due to overhead power supply issues in the Channel Tunnel and a failed LeShuttle train, Eurostar services to and from London will resume this evening at around 6pm following the partial reopening of the Channel Tunnel.\n\n“As the overhead power supply issues in the Channel Tunnel still remain, only one line is available to run trains on. This means there will continue to be delays and longer journey times than usual this evening.\n\n“Therefore we continue to advise our customers to rebook their journey for another day if possible, with free exchanges available.\n\n“We also advise customers not to come to our stations if their trains have been already been cancelled.\n\n“Although outside of our control, we apologise for the disruption today and will continue to keep customers updated with the latest information and support them with rescheduling their bookings.”\n\nYou can rebook, but only “in the same travel class, subject to availability”. Most unfortunately, there do not appear to be any seats on any trains for the rest of the year.\n\nIf you decide to cancel, Eurostar is offering an “e-voucher for the unused ticket, valid for 12 months”, but it would be daft to take this rather than a full cash refund.\n\nNo. In aviation, when an airline cancels a flight it must cover the cost of getting you to your destination as soon as possible (including, if nothing else is available, in Eurostar Premier class).\n\nBut that is not the case for international rail passengers. Even though air fares surged way beyond normal levels, all you can claim back from Eurostar is the original price of your ticket.\n\nTravel insurance is the best route for a claim for extra costs.\n\nThe rail firm says: “Eurostar will cover reasonable expenses, including hotel accommodation up to £150/€170 per room, per night.” The nearest Premier Inn is currently charging £192. Eurostar says the contact centre “will be pragmatic when compensating”. Taxi costs up to £50/€60 per journey are also covered, as well as food and drink expenses up to £35 / €40 per person, per day.\n\nThere is no possibility of an airline-style payout of hundreds of pounds. The best you can hope for is compensation if you travel with Eurostar on a heavily delayed service. The company offers a choice between a partial refund of the cost of your ticket, or a voucher for future travel within a year – typically worth 20 to 50 per cent more than the cash refund.\n\nDelays of under an hour do not qualify for compensation. These are the refund rates according to the length of delay:\n\n60-119 minutes: 25 per cent of journey cost in cash, or 30 per cent as a voucher\n\n120 minutes and above: 50 per cent of journey cost in cash, or 60 per cent as a voucher (increasing to 75 per cent for a delay of three hours or more)\n\nNo. You are unable to claim for costs triggered by the train cancellation, such as a hotel in Paris, Brussels or Amsterdam that you cannot reach. Travel insurance may cover such a loss.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Gregor Konzett, a 27-year-old former Google employee based in London. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I got relocated to work out of Google's Mountain View headquarters in 2024, it was a dream come true.\n\nI was raised in a small village in Austria, but I always dreamed of living in Silicon Valley. As a child who was excited about tech, I wanted to be where innovation happened.\n\nMy team was based in California, but I was working from London. Not even a year into my job, I was asking if I could be transferred.\n\nTwo years after getting hired as a software engineer, Google transferred me to Silicon Valley. Then, a year after that, I quit. I packed up my bags and moved back to London in just two weeks to participate in a startup accelerator program. It was worth the risk, even in this difficult job market.\n\nI joined Google in 2022 as a software engineer on the Google Pixel audio team. I enjoyed my job, but being in London, the physical distance turned minor questions into major delays. If I hit a blocker with a specific subsystem, I'd send a message and wait 24 hours for a reply due to time zone differences, or spend many late nights in chats with colleagues to unblock myself.\n\nAfter I was finally relocated to the Mountain View headquarters, living in the Bay Area was almost exactly as I had always imagined it from movies and TV. California is the most beautiful place I've ever been to, and being able to call it my home was incredible.\n\nIt was great to be part of an environment filled with so many other engineers. I remember going surfing with some people and just having the most Silicon Valley conversation ever about coding and deep tech. The only thing I didn't expect was that it's not this crazy, futuristic place. In reality, the infrastructure was just OK, and the internet speed wasn't even very reliable.\n\nThe work life at the Google headquarters was really nice. On average, it was a typical 9-to-5, and my team had a really great dynamic.\n\nFor the first few months, I was learning a lot, and everything ramped up quickly. My team gave me a lot of responsibility and trusted me to handle huge pieces of the system, which is amazing and rare for a company of its size.\n\nBeing in the office, I got to sit on the same floor as the teams building the specific subsystems I was coding for, and sit in meetings where product decisions were actually made. I could walk 10 feet, point at a whiteboard, and solve complex architectural issues in minutes. I learned \n\nHowever, after about a year, I felt like I had reached a natural ceiling in my work, and I wasn't learning much anymore. I wasn't super happy in my job, and my visa limited me from working on my own projects outside of Google, which was my real dream.\n\nOne of my closest friends got into a startup accelerator program in London and encouraged me to apply, with the plan of using it as an opportunity to cofound our own startup. When I got accepted with a start date only a month away, I knew I'd have to make a quick decision. I loved California, and leaving Google would mean leaving the country.\n\nThe job market has been terrible, and I questioned whether this was the right time to quit my job and potentially face unemployment. However, I felt confident in my technical background and having Google on my résumé, so I believed I could find another job.\n\nThe hardest part about deciding to quit was that it was objectively a really good job, and leaving meant giving up my path to a green card in the US. I was stuck in a dilemma: do I stay in a role I've outgrown for four, or potentially even more years, just to secure permanent residency, or do I quit to chase higher job satisfaction?\n\nI realized that staying for the sake of immigration meant stalling my career development.\n\nI figured now was the time to take a risk. I'm young and have a financial runway from my Google salary, and I don't have a mortgage to pay or a family to care for. So, I put in my two weeks at Google.\n\nIt's been a few months since I joined the program, and my friend and I are working on our startup, Vestry.ai, which fixes the observability gap for complex hardware. Our plan is to build while we're in the accelerator, get funding, and move back to California to live the startup life.\n\nCalifornia is ultimately the place to be for anything in the startup world. We want to be a part of the AI revolution, and that's just where you've got to be.\n\nI've been so busy with the program I haven't really had any time to think about whether I made the right choice, but I'm convinced I'm where I need to be.\n\nDo you have a story to share about quitting Big Tech? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Cybersecurity experts reveal what they do for high-profile clients targeted by hackers such as Scattered Spider\n\nThey call it “stopping the bleeding”: the vital window to prevent an entire database from being ransacked by criminals or a production line grinding to a halt.\n\nWhen a call comes into the cybersecurity firm S-RM, headquartered on Whitechapel High Street in east London, a hacked business or institution may have just minutes to protect themselves.\n\nS-RM, which helped a high-profile retail client recover from a Scattered Spider cyber-attack has become a quiet, often word-of-mouth, success.\n\nMany of the company’s senior workers are multilingual and have a minimal online footprint, which reveals scant but impressive CVs suggestive of corporate or government intelligence-based careers.\n\nS-RM now claims the UK’s largest cyber-incident response team. Its first-responder service is comprised of about 150 experts worldwide. It has clients who keep it on retainer, victims referred by insurers, and “walk-ins”: people who suddenly realise their business is under attack and call the first few results on their search engines.\n\nIn the case of the Scattered Spider victim, which the Guardian understands was not Marks & Spencer or the Co-op – two retailers that were attacked in 2025 – a 30-minute Teams call with a retailer became “a 24-hour call with a rotating cast of experts”, says Ted Cowell, the director of S-RM’s cyber business arm.\n\n“On average we’re getting back to clients within six minutes. Which is critical because often the first hours of a cyber incident can be the biggest chance window to determine the outcome of a case and its impact,” he says. “What can start as a network intrusion can then metastasise into a full-blown malware or ransomware scenario.”\n\nCowell, a Cambridge-educated Russian speaker, says that getting a handle on the attack during a “reconnaissance” period can result in a radically different outcome, compared with a slow response. Criminals often need time after their first penetration of a businesses’ systems to work out what is of most value. This short spell of time can therefore allow experts to prevent the most operationally painful of attacks. “Exfiltration” – the theft of critical data – and encryption, whereby businesses can be locked out of their own systems, can be the most damaging.\n\n“Sometimes we can stop it from going boom,” Cowell says. Teams focus on “stopping the bleeding” by limiting or cutting the attacker’s access to systems. This is what S-RM’s team was able to do with the Scattered Spider victim: stopping the detonation of malware across systems.\n\nBusiness is good as the cybercrime industry grows, but that comes with ethical challenges. S-RM and its industry peers have faced criticism for helping to facilitate the payment of ransoms to criminals who hijack businesses for money.\n\n“Extortion support” is an important part of S-RM’s work. This means its specialists are in the room when ransoms are negotiated, sometimes doing the negotiation itself on behalf of a client. Cowell appears keen to avoid criticisms of feeding organised crime by helping businesses to pay ransoms, or by acting for insurers that sell policies covering ransom payments.\n\n“We’re instructed by the policyholder, by the insured,” he says.\n\n“Our ambition is to guide ‘no payment’ decisions wherever and whenever possible,” he continues, adding that businesses are increasingly taking that approach and not paying ransoms.\n\n“Our role is to facilitate strategic thinking,” he says. “Give clients some structure to order their thoughts. They’ve probably not been in a situation like this before.\n\n“The businesses’ decision as to what they do is their own. We just offer the template of a crisis, how things play out based on our experience.\n\n“Why should we pay these criminals?” is a challenge Cowell says his team puts to top staff at affected businesses. “One of the things that we often educate boards on is that ransomware is an organised criminal enterprise.”\n\nThese nefarious groups have, he explains, “brands to uphold”. Established ransomware groups, typically speaking, will honour a settlement. S-RM also has an increasingly detailed picture of how these groups have behaved in previous negotiations.\n\nThe more established the group, the more likely they are to honour whatever settlement is agreed either by deleting stolen data or providing keys to decrypt critical files. S-RM offers a rundown of who’s who in terms of reliability, negotiating patterns, behaviours, even extending to sanctions concerns.\n\nThe latter rarely applies, however. Trying to impose sanctions on state-linked groups is a game of “whack-a-mole”, Cowell says. If so-called “threat actors” do appear on sanctions lists they tend to disband and reform in a new guise. The risk of putting money, albeit indirectly, into state-enemy hands is therefore another consideration for firms facing a cyber-attack.\n\nStill, businesses do sometimes decide to pay up. It can be rational for their company’s circumstances, and ultimately “it’s always their decision”, Cowell says.\n\nAs the corporate moral code of paying ransoms matures, and decisions not to fund organised crime become more common, restoration and recovery services have become a bigger part of the cybersecurity response market. Increasingly it is a priority to just get systems back up and running as soon as possible with the forensic analysis of how someone got into a system becoming secondary.\n\nIn recent years, the UK government’s cyber-intelligence role has also shifted significantly. The National Cyber Security Centre “over the last four or five years has hugely transformed”, Cowell says. The NCSC has caught up with its Nordic equivalents and now proactively reaches out to victims, telling them they may be targeted based on intelligence.\n\n“It was more of an information taker,” asking the likes of S-RM for information, which they would willingly provide with client consent, Cowell says.\n\n“[Now] they are playing a more robust role, getting on the front foot and getting people together to facilitate information sharing. We saw the impact of that with the Scattered Spider attacks.,” he adds.",

    "description": "After-work pints have long been a sacred tradition of British workers. Has COVID and the world of hybrid work changed that?",
    "fullText": "It's not yet 5 pm on a Thursday in late November, and the skies have fully darkened over the City of London's Leadenhall Market. It's the coldest day in recent memory, a harbinger of the looming winter, but no matter.\n\nHere in London, it's time for a pint.\n\nAfter-work pints have been a sacred tradition of British workers for centuries. For years, Leadenhall Market has been the go-to spot for bankers, insurance brokers, and financial advisors who work in the City, the financial center of London.\n\nBut reports of waning nightlife due to a post-pandemic hangover and Gen Z's growing disinterest in drinking have worried pub-goers and publicans alike.\n\nOver a quarter - 26% - of people in the UK, 16 to 24-year-olds reported themselves as not having an alcoholic drink in a year, according to the most recent Health Survey for England conducted by the National Health Service in 2022. That's the highest percentage of any age group.\n\nThis December, research group IWSR said that Brits are drinking less than ever before, with the average person in the UK having just over 10 drinks a week, down almost 30% from previous highs.\n\nGiven these fears, the Mayor of London has even assembled a task force to help \"protect, retain and grow nightlife\" in the nation's capital.\n\nWrapped up in my warmest scarf and gloves, I paid a visit to this mecca of City nightlife to find out firsthand whether these reports of dampened spirits were true.\n\nNon-locals might not expect a sea of finance bros in this historic covered market, fitting of the Harry Potter universe — probably because it is a scene from that universe. In 2001, Leadenhall Market was used as the exterior of the Leaky Cauldron in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\n\nThe pathways are lined with cobblestones, and the red columns and arched ceilings have been decorated with ornaments. In the center of the market, a Christmas tree towered over tourists with selfie sticks.\n\nBut if you work in the City — the financial center of London — you know that the real attraction of Leadenhall Market is Thursday evening pints.\n\nWhen I arrived just before the clock struck happy hour, the market's alleys were already lively. Men and women dressed almost exclusively in black and brown coats were packed into the barriers outside the pubs, despite the bitter cold.\n\n\"You get used to it,\" Callum, a 26-year-old working as a recruiter in financial services, said with a shrug. \"A beer jacket is a great thing to have.\"\n\nAdmittedly, these crowds aren't quite what I was expecting.\n\nThe data indicate that London hasn't quite recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic, with the city losing a fifth of its late-night venues since 2020, according to a report published in August from the Nighttime Industries Association.\n\nNot everyone's mourning this loss. Some embrace it.\n\nOutside The Swan, I chat with a group of young men who are out for a birthday celebration.\n\n\"He's 26,\" said Joy, who works in insurance, pointing to his friend. \"Pushing 30.\"\n\nJoy, solidly a member of Gen Z, said he doesn't hang around Leadenhall Market too much.\n\n\"Previous generations, it would just be this, just drinking,\" he says of after-work corporate culture. \"But we do a lot more stuff as well, like sports. We play football or padel.\"\n\nDrinking is expensive, for one, and the inflation rate for alcohol leapt after the pandemic. The cost of living is a factor, as is the desire to be healthy and develop meaningful friendships.\n\n\"It's about trying to find a way to connect to others,\" added Michael, also a 24-year-old insurance worker. \"And it helps you drink less than previous generations.\"\n\nJoy and Michael aren't cutting out alcohol entirely. They're out tonight for a special celebration, and Michael mentions that after volleyball practice, he and his fellow players go out for a pint or two. But it's a more moderate approach than their older colleagues, they agreed.\n\nCaroline, a bartender who has worked at Leadenhall Market for 13 years, says that things didn't take too long to return to normal.\n\n\"The City of London is sort of different from other sites. People spend money in this area,\" Caroline said.\n\nStill, things look a little different. Not as many Gen Z-ers buy rounds, Caroline told me, although she's noticed the younger generations are taking more shots than they once did.\n\nBut the biggest difference is the Thursday-ification of after-work drinking culture.\n\nFriday used to be the big night out, but things have changed largely due to the hybrid working culture now present in much of the corporate world.\n\n\"On Friday, most people aren't working in the City,\" Alex, who works in software, told me outside a traditional pub called New Moon. \"There are less people around on Fridays, but the pubs are always busy on a Thursday night.\"\n\nIt's a trend that Caroline has noticed, along with bartender Paolo, who's worked in Leadenhall Market for the past seven years.\n\n\"It's more of a Tuesday to Thursday culture,\" Paolo said, in comparison to the glory days of five nights a week of City workers out for a drink.\n\nIf Leadenhall Market is any bellwether of London as a whole, it would be premature to say nightlife is marching toward its own death. But, thanks in part to Gen Z and changing work habits overall, it does seem to be transforming.\n\nThe sacred London after-work pint is safe, for now.",

    "fullText": "Merlin has been trained to identify the songs of more than 1,300 bird species around the world\n\nWhen Natasha Walter first became curious about the birds around her, she recorded their songs on her phone and arduously tried to match each song with online recordings. After a friend recommended Merlin Bird ID, a free app, she tried it in her London garden and was delighted to discover the birds she assumed were female blackbirds – “this is how bad a birder I was” – were actually song thrushes and mistle thrushes.\n\n“I’m obsessed with Merlin – it’s wonderful and it’s been a joy to me,” says Walter, a writer and human rights activist. “This is what AI and machine-learning have been invented for. It’s the one good thing!”\n\nMerlin is having a moment. The app, developed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in New York, which listens for birdsong and identifies the species singing, has been downloaded 33m times, in 240 countries and territories around the world. Britain has the second highest total number of users – more than 1.5 million in 2024, an 88% increase from 2023. Every month, there has been a 30% increase in new users of the app, whose sound identification function was launched in 2021.\n\nMerlin has been trained to identify the songs of more than 1,300 species around the world, with more birds added twice a year. Different songs make distinct patterns on spectrograms and Merlin is trained to recognise these different shapes and attribute them to a species.\n\nFor latecomers to birding, or those lacking a knowledgeable friend, the app has become their teacher. “My fear at first was I wouldn’t actually learn because I’m outsourcing my understanding of birds to this app,” says Walter. “But that hasn’t come to pass. It’s helped me continue my journey of learning.” Nowadays, she guesses, and uses Merlin to confirm her hunches. “It’s wonderful if you’re coming to bird-watching late and don’t really have a mentor,” she says.\n\nAngela Townsend from Bedfordshire began using Merlin after going on a nightingale walk one spring and being overwhelmed by the range of bird-voices in the evening chorus. She has found it has steadily built up her bird knowledge. “Warblers were just little brown jobbies but I can now recognise Cetti’s warblers and willow warblers when I’m out without having to put the app on,” she says.\n\nMary Novakovich, author of My Family and Other Enemies, is another recent adopter. She has found it particularly useful when travelling across Croatia, where her parents are from. “I love putting a name to a face and a name to the sound,” she says. “It really brings you closer to the natural world, rather than it being disconnected from your life. It’s part of what makes life a joy.”\n\nMerlin is not flawless, however. The first time Kasper Wall, 12, tried it in his Norfolk garden, it detected a northern cardinal and a brown-headed cowbird – North American species not found in Britain.\n\n“I think it was figuring out where we live,” says Wall, who enjoys using it even though he is now an extremely knowledgeable birder. “A couple of weeks ago we were looking at a large group of goldcrest and it came up with a firecrest. I thought, ‘Oh, there must be a firecrest in here too’ and 30 seconds later we saw one, which was the first I’d ever seen. I like it and it’s very good but I wouldn’t say that it’s better than the best people at identifying bird-calls like [the naturalist] Nick Acheson. It can definitely be fooled.”\n\nWall enjoys fooling Merlin with his uncanny impressions of a curlew, barn owl and greenshank.\n\nAcheson doesn’t use Merlin. He welcomes it, but points out it can replace learning. “Anything that gets people out, thinking about and reacting to nature is a great thing,” he says. “But there’s certainly a risk that people don’t learn and just abdicate responsibility for learning to Merlin.”\n\nHe has noticed a glitch where Merlin interprets a certain type of chaffinch call as a redstart, leading to people being absolutely adamant that there is a rare bird in their garden. “There’s no substitute for a real person explaining to you how a birdsong feels and encouraging someone to engage with it emotionally,” he says.\n\nJohn Williamson, who works as a guide for Norfolk Wildlife Trust, has found Merlin repeatedly identifying high-pitched calls as a spotted flycatcher, a bird that is very unlikely to be found in the middle of Hickling Broad nature reserve’s large reedbeds. “Merlin can’t do habitat,” he says.\n\nMerlin has also excited visitors by identifying a golden oriole, a very occasional rare migrant, in Hickling woods, but no one has actually seen the species. Williamson is convinced it is misinterpreting a fairly unusual “catcall” of a female jay, a common woodland bird.\n\nThat said, Williamson finds it a “good tool” and welcomes how it is encouraging new people to enjoy birdsong, and particularly its mental health benefits. He knows one person who suffers from acute anxiety but Merlin has got him out into the world again and into nature, providing a focus for calming trips outdoors. “I find it impressive that an app can empower people to go out into nature,” he says.\n\nResearch has found that birdsong is particularly beneficial to mental health, and has a lasting positive impact on wellbeing. For millions around the globe, that’s exactly what Merlin is doing.\n\n“It reminds you that there are birds knitted into your daily life,” says Walter. “It’s not about, ‘now I’m going to do a bit of birdwatching’, you may simply be walking through the park and you hear something and it gives you a sense that these birds are singing away all the time, even in London.”",

    "fullText": "DENVER (AP) — A Colorado woman suspected of killing two of her young children during a custody dispute with her ex-husband two years ago has been returned from Britain to the United States to face charges, authorities said Tuesday.\n\nColorado Springs-based District Attorney Michael Allen announced the extradition of Kimberlee Singler, 37, on charges including two counts of first-degree murder ahead of her first court appearance in the coming days.\n\nSingler was arrested in December 2023 in London just over a week after her 9-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son were found dead in their home in Colorado Springs. Her 11-year-old daughter was injured but survived. The girl eventually told an investigator that her mother said God made her do it, according to court documents in the United Kingdom.\n\nSingler, who had superficial knife wounds, told police that a man who entered the apartment was responsible. She was initially considered a victim.\n\nThe surviving daughter backed up Singler’s claim at first, but police sought to arrest Singler on Dec. 26, 2023, after they said the girl changed her story. By then Singler was gone. She was found four days later in London’s upscale Chelsea neighborhood and arrested. It is not known why she ended up there.\n\n“Today really is a significant milestone in this criminal investigation,” Colorado Springs Police Chief Adrian Vasquez said at a news conference. “Singler is accused of committing an unthinkable act. ... I know these acts have deeply impacted this community, and our hearts remain with the victims.\"\n\nAllen said Singler will be held without bond at least until a preliminary hearing on whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed toward trial. That hearing typically is scheduled within 30 days of an initial court appearance, with some exceptions, he said.\n\nAllen and other officials declined to discuss details of the prosecution's case beyond procedural steps.\n\nThe FBI and Colorado Springs police traveled to London to take custody of Singler, who fought extradition and denied attacking her children.\n\nHer London defense attorney, Edward Fitzgerald, argued that she should not be extradited because if convicted of first-degree murder in Colorado, she would face a mandatory sentence of life without parole — a sentence that violates European human rights law.\n\nFitzgerald represented WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in his long fight against extradition to face espionage charges in the U.S.\n\nSingler did not yet have a U.S.-based attorney listed as representing her in court documents, according to the court clerk’s office.\n\nA judge rejected Singler's challenge in January 2025, and her bid for an appeal was denied in November.\n\nSingler also faces one count of attempted murder, three counts of child abuse and one count of assault.\n\nAccording to U.K. court documents, the children's bodies were found by police shortly after midnight on Dec. 19, 2023. Police said they found no footprints in the snow leading to a patio where Singler said an intruder entered through an unlocked door and attacked her, causing her to lose consciousness.\n\nShe told police that her ex-husband “had previously dreamt about killing his family, that the children’s father was always trying to ‘frame her’ and ‘get her arrested’ and to have the kids taken away from her,” Judge John Zani said in a January ruling against Singler in Westminster Magistrates' Court.\n\nPolice said GPS records showed that her ex-husband was driving a truck about 80 miles (130 kilometers) away at the time of the killings.\n\nThe family had been staying with Singler’s mother during the custody battle, but the mother was away at the time, according to court documents in the U.K.\n\nThe day before the bodies were found, a judge in Colorado ordered Singler to comply with a previous order to allow the father to take custody of them for the holidays, according to state court records. She was told to either give the children to her ex-husband on her own or bring them to a court hearing Dec. 20, 2023, to exchange custody there.\n\nOn the day of the hearing, Singler asked the judge to delay it, saying in a motion that she and her children had been attacked and two of them were murdered. She asked for time to grieve and “gain my bearings after this incident.”",

He led Paris St-Germain to the Champions League semi-finals in 2024 before winning WSL 2 with London City.\n\nBut London City are not afraid of making mistakes. They genuinely believe this ruthless decision will pay dividends in the future and hope to be judged on that.\n\nWhile Precheur's impact was important during the club's infancy, there is a feeling London City are moving towards a Spanish football identity.\n\nBarcelona have dominated club football in Europe, reaching the Champions League final in six of the past seven seasons and winning the title three times.\n\nSpain's national team are currently the world champions and European runners-up.\n\nSo when former Barcelona head coach Jonatan Giraldez joined Kang's Washington Spirit in 2024, before switching to Lyon this year, it was not a huge surprise.\n\nSpanish football has a clear identity and a way of playing - heavy possession-based football with high technical skill. It is believed London City want to achieve that, as well as the traditional physicality of the English game.\n\nThe club had a shortlist of coaches they looked at to replace Precheur and did not rule out some from the men's game but appear to have ultimately chosen Maestre, who showed his potential with Spanish clubs CD Tenerife and Real Sociedad.\n\nThe main criteria for London City's next appointment is believed to have been centred around the playing style, the coach's ability to collaborate with a wider team of expertise and a track record of developing players and talented youth.\n\nWhen the appointment is confirmed, Maestre would be expected to play a role in the club's January recruitment.\n\nLondon City spent big in the summer, bringing in star names such as France international Grace Geyoro and former Lyon midfielder Danielle van de Donk.\n\nThe transfer policy this time around is believed to be about targeting future stars who can adapt to London City's new-look training programme and coaching style.\n\nThey want to be competing for silverware in the near future, and to battle the Champions League's elite, so they are shopping for future European champions.\n\nMaestre's imminent arrival is likely to be paired with the appointments of other staff members, including analysts and medical experts.\n\nWhat is clear is that London City are not here to make friends, they are here to rock the boat and are planning big things for the future.\n\nWhether it pays off or not, we will have to wait and see.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.
