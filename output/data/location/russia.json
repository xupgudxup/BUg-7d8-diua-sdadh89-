    "fullText": "Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych says he will wear his helmet of remembrance on race days \"because these athletes deserve to be on the track\" - despite the International Olympic Committee banning him from doing so.\n\nHeraskevych wore the helmet, which features images of athletes killed during Russia's invasion of his home country, during a training session on Wednesday after being told it was not allowed.\n\nThe IOC says the helmet breaks the rules laid down in the Olympic Charter and suggests he could instead wear a black armband to pay tribute.\n\nHeraskevych says he does not believe the IOC will impose sanctions on him for continuing to wear it, adding: \"I believe we have all the rights to wear this helmet in competition because it is fully compliant with the rules.\n\n\"I believe the IOC doesn't have enough black bands to honour all of the athletes.\"\n\nThe IOC has not confirmed whether it would disqualify Heraskevych for continuing to wear the helmet, saying it is \"not helpful to look at hypotheticals\".\n\nRule 50.2 of the Olympic Charter states \"no kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas\".\n\nMark Adams, a spokesperson for the IOC, said they will contact Heraskevych on Thursday to \"reiterate his many opportunities to express his grief\".\n\nThe men's skeleton heats begin on Wednesday with the final runs on Friday and Adams says he can show the helmet in mixed zones and on social media but \"the field of play is sacrosanct\".\n\n\"We really want him to compete, we want all athletes to have their moment,\" Adams said.\n\n\"[It's] not helpful to look at hypotheticals. It's not helpful to speculate now, but there are rules and regulations the athletes want us to enforce. In the end it would be an IOC matter.\n\n\"We don't want to prosecute this issue in public - the way we hope we can deal with this is on a human level. It is in everyone's interest for him to compete.\"\n\nHeraskevych said that many of those pictured on his helmet were athletes, including teenage weightlifter Alina Peregudova, boxer Pavlo Ishchenko and ice hockey player Oleksiy Loginov, and some of them were his friends.\n\n\"With this helmet we keep memories about these athletes,\" he said.\n\n\"Some of them were part of the Olympic movement - they were part of the Olympic family. I believe they deserve to be here.\"\n\nThe IOC has previously disqualified athletes for displaying political messages.\n\nAfghan breakdancer Manizha Talash, who represented the Refugee Olympic Team at the 2024 Paris Games, was disqualified for displaying a 'Free Afghan Women' slogan on her cape during a pre-qualifier dance battle.\n\nAmerican figure skater Maxim Naumov, whose parents were among 67 people killed in a plane crash in Washington DC last month, held up a photograph of them after completing his men's singles routine on Thursday while waiting for the score.\n\nHeraskevych says he does not understand the difference between this and his helmet tribute.\n\n\"I believe I have all the rights - these athletes didn't get any punishment and neither should I,\" he said.\n\n\"We have the same rules. They showed photos when they were waiting for the scores. So it was still [in a] venue of participation, it wasn't a mixed zone. It's the same, it's equal. I don't see any difference.\"\n\nIn relation to Naumov, Adams said: \"This is very emotional, very human emotion. It highlights what we are saying - this Ukrainian athlete can do the same. He can show his helmet, walk through the mixed zone and talk to people.\n\n\"We have loosened the rules, we have allowed him to use a black armband. Naumov strengthens our argument - he competed, then expressed human emotion.\"\n\nHeraskevych, Ukraine's first skeleton athlete, held up a 'No War in Ukraine' sign at the 2022 Beijing Olympics, days before Russia's invasion of the country.\n\nUkraine president Volodymyr Zelensky thanked Heraskevych \"for reminding the world of the price of our struggle\" in a post on X.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Russia said on Monday the fuel situation in Cuba was critical and U.S. attempts to \"suffocate\" the island's economy were causing many difficulties, pledging to act ​against any sort of military intervention and expressing Moscow's solidarity with Cuba and Venezuela.\n\nCuba detailed ‌its plans to navigate the deepening crisis on Friday including protecting essential services and rationing fuel, as the communist-run government dug ‌in its heels in defiance of a U.S. effort to cut off oil supplies.\n\nThe administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has declared Cuba \"an unusual and extraordinary threat\" to U.S. national security and said it will no longer receive oil from Venezuela after the U.S. operation to capture its leader Nicolas Maduro last month. It has threatened ⁠to impose tariffs on other suppliers ‌like Mexico if they continue to ship fuel to the island.\n\n\"The situation in Cuba is indeed critical. We are aware of this.

But the Kremlin made clear it was unhappy with Washington's treatment of Cuba.\n\n\"The suffocating tactics ‌employed by the United States are indeed causing many difficulties for the country. We are discussing with our Cuban friends possible ways to resolve these problems, or at least to provide all possible assistance,\" said Peskov.\n\nPeskov was answering a question about jet fuel shortages and whether that might affect Russian tourists wanting to leave Cuba, a long-time ally of Moscow's.\n\nCuba warned international airlines that jet fuel would no longer ⁠be available on the island beginning on Tuesday. Air Canada ​said on Monday it was suspending flights to Cuba.\n\nRussian Foreign ​Minister Sergei Lavrov, in a message marking the day of diplomatic workers in Russia, said Moscow sought to build relations with developing countries.\n\n\"The focus remains on countering neo-colonial ‍practices, from unilateral coercive measures ⁠to military interventions,\" Lavrov wrote on his ministry's website.\n\n\"In this context, we reaffirm our solidarity with the people of Venezuela and Cuba.

    "title": "Russian officials are warning Putin that a financial crisis could arrive this summer, report says, while his war on Ukraine becomes too big to fail",
    "description": "\"Russia has to continue the war because this war is too big for Putin to fail.\"",
    "fullText": "The Kremlin’s financial situation is becoming increasingly dire and could come to a head in a matter of months as oil revenue shrinks while President Vladimir Putin shows no intention of ending his war on Ukraine.\n\nRussian officials have been warning Putin with growing alarm that a financial crisis could hit by the summer, sources told the Washington Post. They pointed to weak oil revenue, which crashed by 50% in January from a year earlier, and a budget deficit that continues to widen, even after Putin hiked taxes on consumers.\n\nA Moscow business executive also told the Post that the crisis could arrive in “three or four months” amid spiraling inflation, adding that restaurants have been closing and thousands of workers are getting laid off.\n\nThe economic strains go back to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine four years ago. As sanctions took hold and Putin mobilized the economy for a prolonged war, a tight labor market and high inflation forced the central bank to keep interest rates high. Recent easing has failed to prevent spending declines in several consumer categories.\n\nWith companies feeling the squeeze of high rates and weaker consumption, more workers not being paid, getting furloughed, or seeing their hours cut. As a result, consumers are having trouble servicing their loans, raising concerns of a crash in the financial sector.\n\n“A banking crisis is possible,” a Russian official told the Washington Post in December on condition of anonymity. “A nonpayments crisis is possible. I don’t want to think about a continuation of the war or an escalation.”\n\nIn June, Russian banks raised red flags on a potential debt crisis as high interest rates weigh on borrowers’ ability to pay off loans. Also that month, the head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs warned many companies were in “a pre-default situation.”\n\nThe Center for Macroeconomic Analysis and Short-Term Forecasting, a state-backed Russian think tank, said in December the country could face a banking crisis by October if loan troubles worsen and depositors pull out their funds, according to the Post.\n\n“The situation in the Russian economy has deteriorated markedly,” wrote Dmitry Belousov, head of the think tank, in a note seen by the Financial Times. “The economy has entered the brink of stagflation for the first time since early 2023.”\n\nRussia’s financial woes could become even more serious as Europe weighs additional sanctions on so-called shadow fleet tankers used to ship Moscow’s oil. That would add to recent U.S. penalties on Russian oil majors Rosneft and Lukoil.\n\nThe West’s tighter sanctions regime has forced Russia to offer steeper discounts on its crude exports, while the recent slide in global oil prices has already hurt its top revenue generator.\n\nDespite the worsening fiscal outlook, Moscow is still spending heavily on weapons and incentives to lure fresh recruits to the army. To cover revenue shortfalls, Russia has tapped its sovereign wealth fund, but that is running out now too.\n\nRussia has also suffered staggering losses on the battlefield, with an estimated 1.2 million killed or wounded since the war began. Last month, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said more than 30,000 Russian troops died in December alone—an average of 1,000 each day—to gain only minimal territory.\n\nAt the same time, European officials have pointed out that Russia is losing strategically, with Ukraine likely headed for EU membership, NATO growing larger after adding new member states, and Europe ramping up defense spending significantly.\n\n“So people are saying that Russia wants to continue the war because they want more territory—that’s rubbish,” Finnish President Alexander Stubb said last month at the World Economic Forum. “Russia has to continue the war because this war is too big for Putin to fail. When you add on to that the Russian economy is in shambles, which means they’re not going to be able to pay their soldiers which means zero growth, end of reserves, interest rates and inflation in double digits. So Putin cannot afford to end this war. This is my big worry.”\n\nIndeed, while Russia has engaged in on-again, off-again talks to end the war, it continues to bombard Ukraine with missiles and drones, targeting its energy infrastructure.\n\nRussian, Ukrainian and U.S. officials just ended two days of talks in Abu Dhabi with little progress reported. In comments released on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the U.S. wants the war to end by June and plans a fresh round of negotiations.\n\n“America proposed for the first time that the two negotiating teams—Ukraine and Russia—meet in the United States of America, probably in Miami, in a week. We confirmed our participation,” he said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — It is pre-dawn in the historic Podil district of the Ukraine capital, Kyiv, and warm light from the Spelta bakery-bistro’s window pierces the darkness outside. On a wooden surface dusted with flour, the baker Oleksandr Kutsenko skilfully divides and shapes soft, damp pieces of dough. As he shoves the first loaves into the oven, a sweet, delicate aroma of fresh bread fills the space.\n\nWhat economic risks do energy attacks pose to Ukraine?\n\nHow are labor shortages impacting Ukrainian companies?\n\nHow are power outages affecting Ukrainian business operations?\n\nWhat additional costs are Ukrainian businesses facing during wartime?\n\nSeconds later the lights go out, the ovens switch off and darkness envelops the room. Kutsenko, 31, steps outside into the freezing night, switches on a large rectangular generator and the power kicks back in. It’s a pattern that will be repeated many times as the business struggles to keep working through the power outages caused by Russia’s bombing campaign on Ukraine's energy grid.\n\n“It’s now more than impossible to imagine a Ukrainian business operating without a generator,” said Olha Hrynchuk, the co-founder and head baker of Spelta.\n\nThe cost of purchasing and operating generators to overcome power outages is just one of many challenges facing Ukrainian businesses after nearly four years of war. Acute labor shortages due to mobilization and war-related migration, security risks, declining purchasing power and complicated logistics add to the pressure, officials say.\n\nHrynchuk, 28, opened the bakery 10 months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. That winter was the first year Russia targeted Ukraine’s energy system. Hrynchuk says they barely know what it is to work under “normal” conditions, but have never faced the challenges they do now.\n\nProduction is entirely dependent on electricity and the generator burns about 700 hryvnias ($16) worth of fuel per hour.\n\n“We run on a generator for 10 to 12 hours a day. You have no fixed schedule — you have to adapt and refuel it at the same time,” Hrynchuk said.\n\nOlha Nasonova, 52, who is head of the Restaurants of Ukraine analytical center, says the industry is experiencing its most difficult period of the past 20 years.\n\nWhile businesses were prepared for electricity cuts, no one expected such a cold winter and it’s been especially tough for small cafés and family-run establishments, because they have the least financial resources.\n\nThe “Best Way to Cup” project, which has two venues and roasts and grinds its own coffee, is on the brink of permanent closure. Co-founder Yana Bilym, 33, who opened the cafe in May, said a Russian attack shattered all its windows and glass doors in August. Bilym said the cost of renovation was 150,000 hryvnias (about $3,400), half of which she financed with a bank loan that she only recently finished repaying.",

His wife told a Russian war blogger on Sunday that Alexeyev ‌had regained consciousness and was able to talk.\n\nThe Federal Security Service (FSB), the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB, said in a statement that a Russian citizen named Lyubomir Korba was detained in Dubai on suspicion of carrying out the shooting.\n\nRussian investigators said Korba, born in the Ternopil region of Soviet Ukraine in 1960, was tasked by Ukrainian intelligence to carry out the shooting. Russia said Ukraine was behind the shooting but Kyiv has denied involvement.\n\nRussian media showed masked FSB officers escorting a blindfolded ⁠man from a small jet in Russia in the ‌dark.\n\nThe FSB said it had identified two accomplices, also Russian citizens. One, Viktor Vasin, was detained in Moscow, while another, Zinaida Serebritskaya, escaped to Ukraine, Russian investigators said.\n\nThe UAE did not release details about how Korba was detained.\n\nThe shooting of such a senior Russian intelligence official just 12 km (7 miles) north of the Kremlin has underscored the vulnerability of top Russian generals involved in executing the war ​in Ukraine.\n\nSome in Russia have questioned how Alexeyev could be tracked in such a location and why he was not guarded better.\n\nThe head of the ‌GRU, Admiral Igor Kostyukov, has been leading Russia's delegation in negotiations with Ukraine in Abu Dhabi on security-related aspects of a potential peace deal.\n\nBehind the front lines of the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War Two, Russia and Ukraine's military intelligence agencies have fought a shadow \"hybrid\" war involving cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns, strikes at strategic infrastructure, and killings.\n\nSince December 2024, three other officials of the same rank as Alexeyev have been killed in or near Moscow.\n\nSince the start of the war in 2022, Ukrainian military intelligence has claimed responsibility for assassinating several senior Russian officers, some of whom have appeared on a public list of Ukraine's ⁠enemies.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha told Reuters on Friday that Ukraine had nothing to do ​with Alexeyev's shooting.\n\n\"We don't know what happened with that particular general - maybe it was their ​own internal Russian in-fighting,\" he said.\n\nThe GRU, like the FSB, is a vast and powerful Russian intelligence agency that includes sleeper agents abroad, special forces units and advanced cyber capabilities.\n\nJailed Russian nationalist Igor Girkin, who has repeatedly scolded Russian generals for what ‍he says the shambolic prosecution of ⁠the war, praised Alexeyev's energy and courage but said the attack was a significant setback.\n\n\"This is a serious blow to our special services,\" Girkin, himself a former FSB officer, said on Telegram.\n\nAlexeyev came to national prominence in June 2023 when he was shown trying to calm down Yevgeny ⁠Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenary group, during a failed mutiny.\n\nIn a video, Alexeyev listened as Prigozhin said he had come to take then-Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Russia's top ‌general, Valery Gerasimov.\n\n\"Take them then,\" Alexeyev said with a chuckle.\n\nThe mutiny fizzled and Prigozhin died in a plane crash two months later.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Reuters; Writing by Gleb Stolyarov; Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Aidan Lewis)",

    "title": "The rulebook that limited US and Russian nukes has fallen apart. Both sides could revert to worst-case scenario planning, experts warn.",
    "description": "Without the verification and communication processes of New START, the US and Russia will have less assurance about each other's nuclear postures.",
    "fullText": "The 15-year agreement restraining the US and Russia's nuclear arsenals is no more, opening the door for distrust that could raise the risk of miscalculation, arms control experts say.\n\nThe expiration of the New START treaty this week, which capped the amount of nuclear warheads that the two sides could deploy on bombers, submarines, and missiles, will reduce the degree of transparency between Washington and Moscow at a moment of high tension in Europe. Without the verification processes and formal exchanges, like site visits, defense planners will find themselves in the dark.\n\n\"That is very likely going to cause both the US and Russia to revert back to worst-case scenario assumptions about each other's actions,\" Mackenzie Knight-Boyle, a senior research associate with the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, told Business Insider.\n\nNew START, signed in 2010 and officially enacted in 2011, was the latest in a series of nuclear arms deals between the US and Russia. It's the first time in decades that neither countries has abided by an agreement to limit the number of operational nuclear warheads. In the New START era, Washington and Moscow could deploy up to 1,550 warheads and 700 launchers.\n\nThe agreement also imposed a system for both sides to verify each other's actions. The US and Russia would notify one another when they moved a nuclear weapon, and sent inspectors to nuclear sites like missile, bomber, and submarine bases. Experts called the New START process robust and informative, building confidence that the two nuclear powers were following their agreement.\n\nWithout it, there's a \"sense of less predictability and transparency between the two nations,\" Eliana Johns, a senior research associate with the Nuclear Information Project at FAS, told Business Insider. The verification process provided detailed information about nuclear activities, including exercises and storage sites, down to specifics like how many B-52 Stratofortress bombers were equipped to carry nuclear weapons, she added.\n\nThe US and Russia are far and away the countries with the largest nuclear arsenals, even decades after the Cold War. China's rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal has worried American leaders, despite its pledge not to use nukes first in a war.\n\nNow, the predictability brought by New START is gone. Without limitations, nuclear forces like intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarines could be increased in ways that risk a Cold War-like arms race. Right now, all of the US' deployed ICBMs only carry one, but around half have Mk21A reentry vehicles that could carry three. Planning and posturing will be filled with more unknowns, and defense officials on both sides will be making assumptions in assessing risks.\n\nAccording to Knight-Boyle, Johns, and FAS Nuclear Information Project associate director Matt Korda and director Hans Kristensen, it's possible the US ICBM force could double from 400 warheads to 800 with uploaded reserve warheads. Increasing the warhead count for submarines could be faster and could add upwards of 800 to 900 warheads. The quickest ramp-up involves configuring B-2 Spirit bombers and B-52s to carry more bombs, and there are estimates of up to 800 nuclear weapons available to these aircraft.\n\nThis doesn't mean the US and Russia will immediately begin to take these actions, though. Uploading warheads would require significant resources, logistics planning, and time, could enflame tensions, and would raise vulnerability concerns. But both countries have \"significant warhead upload capacity that would allow them to increase their deployed nuclear forces relatively quickly,\" the arms control experts wrote this week.\n\nNew START was only intended to be in place for a decade with the option of a five-year extension, which the US and Russia agreed to in 2021. The following year, Russia invaded Ukraine, and in 2023, Russia suspended its participation but said it would still follow numerical limits. This meant the exchange of data, notifications, and information was halted. The US followed suit.\n\nRussia has offered to observe those caps for another year. And on the day the agreement expired, Axios reported that there were negotiations for both countries to follow New START's limitations, but whether that deal would include verification processes is unknown. When asked whether there was a temporary agreement after the treaty's expiration, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, \"not to my knowledge.\"\n\nIn the absence of New START, experts are concerned mistrust and assumptions could lead nuclear powers to increase their arsenal. \"And that creates a domino effect where if the US uploads warheads for fear of Russia's actions, Russia does it reciprocally,\" Knight-Boyle said. Other nuclear states, like China, must also be considered in that possibility.\n\nChina's nuclear arsenal has been the focus of officials in Washington in light of New START's expiration. President Donald Trump and other administration officials have said future nuclear arms deals must incorporate China due to its rapidly growing nuclear force. Per Pentagon estimates, Beijing's arsenal is expected to top 1,000 warheads by 2030.\n\n\"The president's been clear in the past that in order to have true arms control in the 21st century, it's impossible to do something without China,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this week. Washington also accused Beijing of conducting nuclear explosive tests, including one in 2020, which violates an international ban.\n\nIn response to a question about China's role in a potential future nuclear arms deal, Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, said, \"China's nuclear strength is by no means at the same level with that of the US or Russia. Thus, China will not take part in nuclear disarmament negotiations for the time-being.\"",

    "description": "The U.S. has given Ukraine and Russia a June deadline to reach a deal to end the nearly four‑year war, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters, as Russian strikes on energy infrastructure forced ...",
    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The U.S. has given Ukraine and Russia a June deadline to reach a deal to end the nearly four‑year war, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters, as Russian strikes on energy infrastructure forced nuclear power plants to cut output on Saturday.\n\nIf the June deadline is not met, the Trump administration will likely put pressure on both sides to meet it, he added.\n\n“The Americans are proposing the parties end the war by the beginning of this summer and will probably put pressure on the parties precisely according to this schedule,” Zelenskyy said, speaking to reporters on Friday. Zelenskyy’s comments were embargoed until Saturday morning.\n\n“And they say that they want to do everything by June. And they will do everything to end the war. And they want a clear schedule of all events,” he said.\n\nHe said the U.S. proposed holding the next round of trilateral talks next week in their country for the first time, likely in Miami, Zelenskyy said. “We confirmed our participation,” he added.\n\nZelenskyy said Russia presented the U.S. with a $12 trillion economic proposal — which he dubbed the “Dmitriev package” after Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev. Bilateral economic deals with the U.S. form part of the broader negotiating process.\n\nRussian strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure continued with over 400 drones and about 40 missiles launched overnight Saturday, Zelenskyy said in a post on X. Targets included the energy grid, generation facilities and distribution networks.\n\nUkrenergo, the state energy transmission operator, said the attack was the second mass strike on energy infrastructure since the start of the year, forcing nuclear power plants to reduce output. Eight facilities in eight regions came under attack, it said in a statement.\n\n“As a result of missile strikes on key high-voltage substations that ensured the output of nuclear power units, all nuclear power plants in the territories under control were forced to reduce their load,” the statement said.\n\nIt said the power deficit in the country has increased “significantly” as a result of the attacks forcing an extension of hourly power outages in all regions of Ukraine.\n\nThe latest deadline follows U.S.-brokered trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi that produced no breakthrough as the warring parties cling to mutually exclusive demands. Russia is pressing Ukraine to withdraw from the Donbas, where fighting remains intense — a condition Kyiv says it will never accept.\n\n“Difficult issues remained difficult. Ukraine once again confirmed its positions on the Donbas issue. ‘We stand where we stand’ is the fairest and most reliable model for a ceasefire today, in our opinion,” Zelenskyy said. He reiterated that the most challenging topics would be reserved for a trilateral meeting between leaders.\n\nZelenskyy said no common ground was reached on managing the Russian‑held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and expressed skepticism about a U.S. proposal to turn the Donbas region, coveted by Russia, into a free economic zone as a compromise.\n\n“I do not know whether this can be implemented, because when we talked about a free economic zone, we had different views on it,” he said.\n\nHe said in the last round of talks the negotiators discussed how a ceasefire would be technically monitored. He added that the U.S. has reaffirmed it would play a role in that process.\n\nRepeated Russian aerial assaults have in recent months focused on Ukraine’s power grid, causing blackouts and disrupting the heating and water supply for families during a bitterly cold winter, putting more pressure on Kyiv.\n\nZelenskyy said the U.S. again proposed a ceasefire banning strikes on energy infrastructure. Ukraine is ready to observe such a pause if Russia commits; but he added that when Moscow previously agreed to a one-week pause suggested by the U.S., it was violated after just four days.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "The fighter, built for war with Russia, is set to be one of the three main pillars of Ukraine's future air force.",
    "fullText": "Swedish defense prime Saab is exploring the Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System as a cheaper armament option for its JAS 39 Gripen fighters, firm executives told Business Insider this week.\n\n\"The APKWS is in interest because other platforms are now integrating 70mm guided rockets. So we are, of course, eyeing that capability now,\" Jussi Halmetoja, operations advisor for Saab's air domain, said at the Singapore Airshow.\n\nHalmetoja said the company was looking at ways to integrate the weapons system, which uses a guided version of the Hydra 70mm rocket, onto its older Gripen C and latest Gripen E models.\n\nHe made the comments as he and Mikael Franzên, chief marketing officer for the Gripen program, discussed the company's observation from the Ukraine war that it needs more inexpensive weapons to counter uncrewed aerial systems.\n\n\"I mean, right now we are using very expensive weapons to kill very cheap drones,\" Franzén said of traditional Western air combat.\n\nHe added that Saab is hoping to potentially equip the Gripen with systems that can fit multiple munitions onto a single hardpoint.\n\n\"If you can have four or 10 on each hardpoint, then you can kill a lot more drones,\" Franzên said. The APWKS is typically mounted on aircraft with multilaunch pods.\n\nKyiv has signed a letter of intent with Sweden to potentially acquire up to 150 Gripen E fighters in the coming years. Ukraine's air force has yet to fly the jet, which is touted as an ideal fighter for battling Russia because it's built to operate from dispersed, rugged airfields and in the Arctic domain.\n\nKyiv is now flying much of its small fleet of F-16 Fighting Falcons from such small airfields, often moving the aircraft to increase their survivability.\n\nBut Franzén and Halmetoja said the Gripen can turn around much faster from dispersed airfields and be ready for a new mission within 10 minutes of landing.\n\nSweden, South Africa, Brazil, Thailand, Czechia, and Hungary are among the countries that fly the Gripen.\n\nThe APWKS, meanwhile, is already being deployed across various systems in Ukraine.\n\nFor example, the VAMPIRE counter-UAS systems feature a four-barrel launcher for the guided Hydra rockets that can be mounted on a pickup truck.\n\nThe cost of using one APKWS round is estimated at $20,000 to $35,000, compared to weapons more typically associated with modern fighters, such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder, which costs roughly $450,000, and the AIM-120 AMRAAM, which costs roughly $1 million.\n\nConcerns about missile costs against cheaper drones have risen steadily since the war began, and as Russia has continuously grown its loitering munitions mass manufacturing.\n\nOutside Ukraine, the US military has also been using the APWKS to recently fight drone attacks in the Middle East. The weapons system, loaded on American F-16s and F-15s, was responsible for roughly 40% of the drone kills scored by US forces against Houthi drones during last year's Operation Rough Rider.",

    "fullText": "A high-profile general in Russia's military has been shot several times and wounded in Moscow.\n\nLt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev, 64, was taken to hospital after the attack in a residential block of flats in the north-western outskirts of the capital, and is believed to be in a serious condition. The attacker fled the scene.\n\nAlexeyev is number two in the main directorate of Russia's GRU military intelligence and the latest high-ranking military figure to have been targeted in or near Moscow since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nNo-one has so far claimed the attack, but senior Russian officials immediately blamed Ukraine, saying it was trying to derail negotiations to end the war.\n\n\"The victim has been taken to one of the city's hospitals,\" said Svetlana Petrenko of Russia's Investigations Committee (SK), which said it opened a criminal case for attempted murder.\n\nInvestigators are searching CCTV footage for clues and began interviewing potential witnesses of the attack on Friday morning on Volokolamsk Highway.\n\nA neighbour of Alexeyev told the Reuters news agency she had been woken by the sound of \"several\" shots and had then heard another neighbour screaming for help.\n\n\"This is all I heard. Other neighbours rushed out, too. They asked how they could help, should they call ambulance and police, but she had already called them.\"\n\nAlexeyev has played a significant role during the war in Ukraine, taking part in talks with Ukraine during the Russian siege of the city of Mariupol in 2022.\n\nEarlier he was awarded the title Hero of Russia for the role he played in Moscow's military intervention in Syria's civil war.\n\nHe was placed under European Union and UK sanctions after the GRU was accused of being behind the 2018 nerve agent attack in Salisbury in the UK.\n\nHe was also sent to negotiate with the head of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who led a short and bloody mutiny in June 2023.\n\nHis boss at the GRU, Igor Kostyukov, has been in charge of Russia's negotiating team at peace talks with Ukrainian and US teams in Abu Dhabi. The latest round ended on Thursday without a major breakthrough.\n\nIt is not yet known who was behind the shooting - but Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quick to accuse Ukraine.\n\nHe said \"this terrorist act\" was aimed at \"disrupting the negotiation process\".\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Vladimir Putin was being briefed on the shooting. \"We wish first of all that the general survives and recovers. We hope that will be the case,\" Peskov told reporters.\n\nUkraine has not commented but has claimed some attacks on Russian military figures in the past. Russian intelligence officials claimed they had thwarted an attempted attack on a Russian soldier in St Petersburg at the end of last month.\n\nAn Uzbek man was jailed in January for the 2024 killing of another general, Igor Kirillov, in an explosion outside a block of flats in Moscow. Sources in Ukraine's SBU intelligence said at the time it was behind the attack.\n\nLt Gen Kirillov had been in charge of Russia's Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection troops.\n\nIn December 2025, another high-ranking officer in the GRU, Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov, was killed when an explosive device detonated under a car in Moscow. He was in charge of the armed force's operational training department, according to Russia's SK.",

Kennan senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nLoans for Venezuela's purchase of Russian weapons could meet the same fate, while trade between the two countries could also come to a halt, Sestanovich added.\n\nThat would come at a sensitive moment for Russia's economy.\n\nAs the war in Ukraine approaches its fifth year, sweeping Western sanctions and lower oil prices are weighing on budget revenues that fund President Vladimir Putin's war chest. In January, Russia's oil revenue plunged to its lowest level in over five years.\n\nAt least one Russian state-owned oil company has moved to ringfence its exposure.

    "description": "The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Thursday that Russia’s Starlink satellite internet terminals in Ukraine have been “cut off,” disrupting Russian military communications.",
    "fullText": "The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Thursday that Russia’s Starlink satellite internet terminals in Ukraine have been “cut off,” disrupting Russian military communications.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said SpaceX, which owns Starlink, is working with Ukraine to update a “whitelist” of approved and verified Starlink terminals, while unapproved Russian systems have been blocked.\n\n“The Starlink terminals added to the ‘whitelist’ are working. The Russians’ terminals have already been blocked,” Fedorov said in a statement Thursday. “We continue to verify Starlink terminals. The first batch of terminals that made it onto the ‘whitelist’ are already operational.”\n\nA source at the General Staff of the Ukrainian armed forces claimed that “all Russian Starlinks have been cut off” along the front line as of Thursday evening local time.\n\nUnder US sanctions, Starlink cannot be sold to or used by Russia. However, analysts and Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia has increasingly been finding ways to leverage the system to its own advantage. CNN previously reported on Russia’s practice of mounting Starlink systems on its attack drones, which allow the weapons to bypass Ukraine’s electronic defenses that disable drones by jamming GPS and radio signals, and to strike deeper into the country.\n\nUkraine has also relied heavily on Starlink since the beginning the war, using it to operate military communications and drones, as well as information systems for public institutions like hospitals and schools.\n\n“The enemy on the front lines is facing not just a problem, but a catastrophe. All command and control of the troops has collapsed. Assault operations have been halted in many areas,” said Serhii Beskrestnov, an adviser to the defense minister.\n\nElon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, said earlier this week that it was taking steps to stop Russia’s “unauthorized” use of the Starlink satellite internet constellation. Musk reiterated Thursday that it’s “important to register your Starlink terminal if in Ukraine.”\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Defense has not addressed the claims of Starlink disruptions.\n\nBut Russian military bloggers began commenting on the Starlink outages on Wednesday and Thursday, noting that Russia’s internet and communications capabilities on the front line have taken a hit.\n\nOne pro-Kremlin military blogger, Boris Rozhin, wrote a Q&A-style post on Telegram, saying, “Yes, it will have a certain impact on internet availability in the field,” and “yes, there are no alternatives at all, right now.” He also claimed that Russian forces were working to bypass the block and to bring high-speed internet to the field using other methods.\n\nAnother Russian military blog, which supports the airborne special forces, tried to downplay the disruption, writing: “The Starlinks may have been shut down, but the backup communications are still there. The radios are working, and there’s communication between the positions.”\n\nSome Starlink units used by the Ukrainian side were also reportedly cut off, although it’s unclear how widespread the disruption is, as the government continues the whitelisting process.\n\nOne Ukrainian combat officer, Tetiana Chornovol, posted on social media that “the shutdown of Starlink left my two combat positions without communication,” adding that her unit has since brought in an alternative communication system.\n\n“It works for us,” a Ukrainian drone pilot said in a video posted to Telegram. “We immediately registered our Starlink terminal, and everything is fine.”\n\nMeanwhile, the second round of trilateral talks between Ukraine, Russia and the United States concluded in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.\n\nUkrainian presidential chief of staff Kyrylo Budanov, who was part of his country’s delegation, described the negotiations as “truly constructive.”\n\n“I am grateful to the US and the UAE for their high-quality organization and mediation,” Budanov told the Ukrainian news agency RBC-Ukraine.\n\nWhile no breakthrough deal came out of the two days of talks, Russia and Ukraine did agree to conduct their first prisoner exchange since October. Each returned 157 prisoners of war to the other side on Thursday, according to Russian state news agency TASS and US negotiator Steve Witkoff.\n\n“While significant work remains, steps like this demonstrate that sustained diplomatic engagement is delivering tangible results and advancing efforts to end the war in Ukraine,” Witkoff said Thursday in a post on X.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the negotiators agreed to hold another round of talks “in the near future.”\n\nCNN’s Ivana Kottasová, Daria Tarasova-Markina and Sophie Tanno contributed to this report.",

    "description": "The U.S. and Russia agreed Thursday to reestablish high-level military dialogue for the first time in more than four years in another sign of warming relations between the two countries since Presiden...",
    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The U.S. and Russia agreed Thursday to reestablish high-level military dialogue for the first time in more than four years in another sign of warming relations between the two countries since President Donald Trump returned to office and sought to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nHigh-level military communication was suspended in late 2021, as tension between Moscow and Washington rose ahead of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Trump then campaigned for a second term on promises that he would swiftly end the fighting. Many of his proposals for peace have heavily favored the Kremlin, including requiring Ukraine to cede territory to Russia.\n\nThe restored communication channel “will provide a consistent military-to-military contact as the parties continue to work towards a lasting peace,” the U.S. European Command said in a statement. The agreement emerged from a meeting between senior Russian and American military officials in the capital of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nU.S. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, who is the commander in Europe of both U.S. and NATO forces, was in Abu Dhabi, where talks between American, Russian and Ukrainian officials on ending the war entered a second day.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow escalated its attacks on Ukraine’s power grid in an apparent effort to deny civilians power and to weaken public support for the fight, while hostilities continued along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line snaking through eastern and southern parts of Ukraine.\n\nThe resumption of the military hotline marks an effort to ease tensions that soared after the start of the war and to avoid collisions between Russian and U.S. forces.\n\nIn one such incident in March 2023, the American military said it ditched an Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone in the Black Sea after a pair of Russian fighter jets dumped fuel on it, and then one of them struck its propeller while flying in international airspace.\n\nMoscow has denied that its warplanes hit the drone, alleging that it crashed while making a sharp maneuver. The Kremlin said its aircraft reacted to a violation of a no-fly zone Russia has established in the area near Crimea.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly voiced concern about intelligence flights by the U.S. and other NATO aircraft over the Black Sea, and some Russian officials charged that the American surveillance flights helped gather intelligence that allowed Ukraine to strike Russian targets.\n\nNATO members have been increasingly worried about intrusions into allied airspace. Some European officials described the incidents as Moscow testing NATO’s response.\n\nIn September, a swarm of Russian drones flew into Poland’s airspace, prompting NATO aircraft to scramble to intercept them and shoot down some of the devices. It was the first direct encounter between NATO and Moscow since the full-scale invasion. Later that month, NATO jets escorted three Russian warplanes out of Estonia’s airspace.\n\nRussia, Ukraine exchange prisoners following talks\n\nThe delegations from Moscow and Kyiv were joined Thursday in Abu Dhabi by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, according to Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council chief, who was present at the meeting.\n\nThey were also at last month's talks in the same place as the Trump administration tries to steer Russia and Ukraine toward a settlement.\n\nOfficials have provided no information about any progress in the discussions.\n\nFollowing the talks on Thursday, however, Russia and Ukraine said they carried out a prisoner exchange.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said it brought 157 Russian servicemen back from Ukrainian captivity, as well as three Russian nationals captured during Kyiv's incursion into Russia's Kursk region. Ukrainian officials said 150 Ukrainian servicemen and seven civilians returned from Russian captivity.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said the released Russian soldiers are currently in Belarus, getting medical assistance, before being taken back to Russia “for treatment and rehabilitation.”\n\nUkrainian human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said that among the 150 service members who returned from Russian captivity, 18 were \"illegally sentenced by Russia.” He said that “overall, those released are in a difficult psychological condition, and some are critically underweight.”\n\nZelenskyy says 55,000 Ukrainian troops killed in the war\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 55,000 Ukrainian troops have died since Russia’s invasion. “And there is a large number of people whom Ukraine considers missing,” he added in an interview broadcast late Wednesday by French TV channel France 2.\n\nThe last time Zelenskyy gave a figure for battlefield deaths, in early 2025, he said 46,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed.\n\nZelenskyy has repeatedly said his country needs security guarantees from the U.S. and Europe to deter any postwar Russian attacks.\n\nUkrainians must feel that there is genuine progress toward peace and “not toward a scenario in which the Russians exploit everything to their advantage and continue their strikes,” Zelenskyy said on social media late Wednesday.\n\nLast year saw a 31% increase in Ukrainian civilian casualties compared with 2024, the advocacy group Human Rights Watch said in a report published Wednesday.\n\nAlmost 15,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and just over 40,000 wounded since the start of the war through last December, according to the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine.\n\nRussian troops have lost access to their Starlink satellite internet terminals on the front line, Ukrainian Economic Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said Thursday, after Ukraine asked Elon Musk’s SpaceX to help deny Russia use of the service in Ukraine.\n\nRussian forces have consequently lost command-and-control capabilities and navigation for drones, and assaults have stopped in many sectors, according to Fedorov’s adviser Serhii Beskrestnov. Russian officials made no immediate comment.\n\nUkraine is registering its civilian and military Starlink users on a database, allowing approved devices to function while unregistered terminals are disabled inside Ukraine.\n\nAlso, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said during a visit to Kyiv that he agreed with Zelenskyy to develop the joint production of ammunition at plants in their countries.\n\nZelenskyy said Poland plans to increase supplies to Ukraine of liquefied natural gas, and the countries are exploring an exchange of weaponry, with Kyiv possibly receiving Polish MiG fighter jets and Warsaw receiving Ukrainian drones.\n\nRussia fired 183 drones and two ballistic missiles at Ukraine overnight, according to the Ukrainian air force. Three people were injured, officials said.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said its air defenses downed 95 Ukrainian drones overnight over several regions, the Azov Sea and Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014.\n\nThis story corrects an earlier version that said Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2016. The annexation happened in 2014.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Russian missiles and drones have pounded Ukraine’s energy grid in recent weeks, plunging people into frozen darkness in one of the country’s coldest winters on record.\n\nUkraine has accused Russia of illegally targeting power infrastructure during the war to deny civilians light, heating and running water.\n\n\"Taking advantage of the coldest days of winter to terrorize people is more important to Russia than diplomacy,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday, on the eve of a new round of talks about ending the conflict and as temperatures in Kyiv hovered around minus 20 C (minus 3 F).\n\nRussia says its attacks are a legitimate part of its military campaign against its neighbor. Moscow's invasion of Ukraine itself is widely regarded as an illegal act of aggression.\n\nSo, are attacks on energy installations allowed during war?\n\nCombatants can legally target a power grid if the attack “directly affects a valid military target” — but they cannot cause excessive civilian casualties, said David Crane, former chief prosecutor at the United Nations Special Court for Sierra Leone.\n\nIn the case of Russia's attacks on Ukraine, “the indiscriminate and widespread targeting does not come close to what is legal,” he said in an emailed response to questions from The Associated Press.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross says that parts of energy systems providing essential services to civilians “are in principle civilian objects, and as such are protected against direct attack and reprisals as well as incidental harm.”\n\nPretrial judges from the International Criminal Court, in fact, issued arrest warrants in 2024 for top Russian military brass and the country’s former defense minister for their alleged involvement in missile strikes targeting electricity infrastructure.\n\nIn announcing warrants for former Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Russia’s chief military officer, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the court said that judges found “reasonable grounds to believe that the alleged strikes were directed against civilian objects, and for those installations that may have qualified as military objectives at the relevant time, the expected incidental civilian harm and damage would have been clearly excessive to the anticipated military advantage.”\n\nRussia is not a member of the court, rejects its jurisdiction, and refuses to extradite suspects to face justice in the ICC’s courtrooms in The Hague, Netherlands.\n\nThe Russian military has repeatedly said that it has targeted energy facilities and other infrastructure that support Ukrainian military industries and armed forces. It has denied targeting residential areas despite daily evidence to the contrary.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted Wednesday that “our military is striking the targets that they believe are associated with the military complex of the Kyiv regime, the operation is continuing.”\n\nKyiv accuses Russia of seeking to wear down Ukrainians’ appetite for the fight by inflicting grinding hardship on civilians forced to live in dark, freezing homes.\n\nAuthorities say Russia has tried to cripple Ukraine's electricity network by targeting substations, transformers, turbines and generators at power plants. Ukraine’s largest private power company, DTEK, said that this week's overnight attack was the ninth major assault on the company’s thermal power plants since October.\n\nUkraine’s energy sector has suffered more than $20 billion in direct war damage, according to a joint estimate by the World Bank, the European Commission and the United Nations.",

    "description": "The developers behind Ukraine's interceptor drones are working to ensure that these cheap air defense tools don't become obsolete.",
    "fullText": "The developers behind Ukraine's interceptor drones are constantly having to upgrade their products to keep pace with changing Russian tactics and ensure these cheap air defense tools don't become obsolete.\n\nSeveral people directly involved with interceptor drones and their development told Business Insider that the systems are being upgraded, though how quickly those improvements roll out varies.\n\nInterceptor drones emerged last year as a crucial, low-cost tool Ukraine uses to defend against worsening Russian attacks.\n\nThese weapons are typically used to hunt fixed-wing Russian drones conducting strike and reconnaissance missions. They're armed with small warheads and fly directly into their targets or explode nearby to destroy them midair.\n\nSome Ukrainian interceptor drones cost as little as $2,500 — just a fraction of the price of the Russian drones, estimated to cost between $10,000 and $100,000, depending on their battlefield function.\n\nRussia has changed its tactics over the past year, modifying its drones to fly faster and higher and even arming them with cameras and air-to-air missiles to defeat Ukrainian defenses. The changes have forced Ukraine's defense industry to adapt.\n\nWild Hornets, a defense technology outfit making drones for the Ukrainian military, \"continuously plans upgrades\" to its drones and other related equipment like ground control systems, said Alex Roslin, the firm's foreign support coordinator.\n\nThis process occurs daily, he said, and \"innovations\" are made at all levels of the production journey, from individual components to new systems like Wild Hornets' well-known Sting interceptor drone.\n\nRoslin said the firm is focused on refining its drones and scaling up production, priorities the team discusses every day.\n\nSome other products receive improvements at a slower pace. For instance, the British government, which is working to produce thousands of interceptor drones a month for Ukraine, said in early January that it updates the design about every six weeks \"to stay ahead of Russian tactics.\"\n\nBritain said \"live battlefield data feeds straight into UK production lines, allowing rapid upgrades and faster delivery to the front line.\"\n\nAs the need for interceptor drones grows among Kyiv's forces, so does the market for these weapons. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters last month that the local defense industry is producing around 1,000 systems a day, hitting the goal he set over the summer.\n\nWith so many interceptor drones now on the market, competition is driving manufacturers to constantly improve their products to fly faster and higher to meet the Russian threats, said Oleksiy, the deputy commander of a Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces mobile air defense unit.\n\nOleksiy's unit is tasked with protecting Irpin, a city on the outskirts of Kyiv, and has historically relied on a .50-caliber M2 Browning machine gun mounted in the bed of a pickup truck to battle Russian drones.\n\nHis crew began training on new interceptor drones last year to strengthen their defensive arsenal. The drones can fly at speeds of around 300 kilometers per hour (186 miles per hour) and reach an altitude of up to 6,000 meters (nearly 20,000 feet).\n\nHe said the quadcopter-style interceptor drone his crew trains with is updated every six months using feedback from combat forces provided to the manufacturer.\n\nThe rise of Ukraine's interceptor drones has come as Russia has invested heavily in long-range drone operations, regularly sending hundreds of drones — some armed and others decoys designed to exhaust air defenses — across the border in nightly attacks.\n\nWestern military officials and Ukrainian organizations have said that interceptor drones are responsible for downing thousands of Russian drones over the past year.\n\nNATO countries are taking note of the interceptors' success as a low-cost air defense tool, with some allies buying and deploying systems to defend the Eastern flank from possible Russian drone incursions.",

Maryna Vyshnevska, 35, said it had become too dangerous for her and her five children - some ‌of the few remaining residents - to stay.\n\n\"We thought they (the Russians) would be driven back and all this would stop,\" Vyshnevska said, before packing her family and a handful of belongings into a police evacuation bus. \"But when we realised it would only get worse and worse, it was better to leave.\"\n\nAs Russia and ⁠Ukraine start new U.S.-brokered peace talks ‌in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, Moscow's forces have slowly ground forward along various parts of the 1,200-km (745 mile) front line in recent months.\n\nWhile closing on the ‍so-called \"fortress belt\" of cities in the eastern Donetsk region, Russian troops are also advancing toward Zaporizhzhia - which is the capital of one of four Ukrainian regions the Kremlin has claimed as its own despite occupying only part of ​the Zaporizhzhia region.\n\n'EVERY WEEK, WE SEE MORE DESTRUCTION'\n\nFighting has intensified in recent weeks in key ‌areas of the southeastern front, Ukraine's military has said, particularly around the town of Huliaipole - 40 km (25 miles) to the east of Tavriiske.\n\nIn Tavriiske and nearby villages, which sit in a bulge in the frontline with Russian forces on three sides, residents told Reuters during a recent visit that they feared for their lives amid the constant threat of drone and bomb attacks.\n\nPolice teams and volunteers roam ⁠the main regional road - which is shrouded in anti-drone netting - ​to rescue residents in danger. Local authorities said almost no ​families remain in the area around Tavriiske.\n\n\"Every day, every week, we see more destruction and a greater risk of entering towns like these,\" said volunteer Vlad Makhovskyi, ‍51, adorned with a ⁠tactical helmet and gear.\n\nAt one location, two men lugged an elderly woman out of a ramshackle house on a bright pink bed sheet.\n\nNataliia Fedorenko, 66, broke down into tears describing the ⁠mounting emotional toll of remaining in a war zone as fighting worsened. Like Vyshnevska, she also left.\n\n\"It's scary. Nobody wants ‌to die. I know I don't have much time left, but this kind of ‌death...?\"\n\n(Writing by Dan Peleschuk, Editing by William Maclean)",

    "description": "Volodymyr Zelensky has been talking up Russia’s battlefield fatalities and has asked his new Defense Minister to make it a priority.",
    "fullText": "Volodymyr Zelensky has been talking up Russia’s battlefield fatalities and has asked his new defense minister to make it a priority.\n\nIn December alone, more than 35,000 Russian soldiers were killed or seriously wounded, Ukraine’s leader says, and the aim should be to raise the number even higher – to 50,000 per month.\n\n“Make the cost of war for Russia one it cannot sustain, thereby forcing peace through strength” – this was the task set him by the president, Mykhailo Fedorov told reporters in his first briefing as Defense Minister.\n\nThe suggestion that Russia is suffering heavy losses is not new. A new report last week estimated that 1.2 million Russians have either been killed, wounded or are missing since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost four years ago – the highest casualty figure suffered by a major military power since World War II. The report put the number of Ukrainian casualties between 500,000 and 600,000.\n\n“The data suggests Russia is hardly winning,” the report’s authors wrote.\n\nMaybe not, but as senior officials from Ukraine, Russia and the United States prepare for the next round of direct talks in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, it would be a mistake for Ukraine’s supporters to get carried away.\n\n“Highlighting the huge numbers of Russian fatalities is an indicator that Ukraine’s main strategy is attrition. But we need more than that if we are going to move the war dynamics in a better direction,” a former Ukrainian official told CNN.\n\nOn the one hand, focusing on headline-grabbing numbers offers important perspective on Ukraine’s refusal to give up Donetsk as part of any “peace” deal with Russia.\n\nThe logic behind Kyiv’s position is simple: Very few Ukrainians believe Putin has any goal other than the total subjugation of their country. So, why hand over territory for nothing if Ukraine can expect to kill hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers while Moscow keeps trying to capture Donetsk by force?\n\nUkrainian soldiers still hold about 20% of the eastern region, which includes heavily fortified cities like Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, and latest estimates by the Institute for the Study of War suggest it could be another 18 months before Russia captures it all.\n\nIf those Russian soldiers are not killed fighting – the logic continues – they will remain in occupied Ukrainian territory ready to restart the war, from a more advantageous position, just as soon as the Kremlin has contrived a pretext to do so.\n\nVery few in Ukraine believe Putin will drop his territorial demands, and most have lost faith that US President Donald Trump will apply necessary pressure to make him change his mind.\n\n“Despite the government negotiating in good faith, many think the whole process is done to ensure US government support,” the former Ukrainian official said.\n\n“People are exceedingly skeptical about the negotiating process.”\n\nBut if there is no confidence that negotiations are headed anywhere, what about Ukraine’s battlefield strategy? Is piling up the other side’s body bags the best way forward?\n\nAn American former fighter, Ryan O’Leary, who led an international volunteer unit called Chosen Company, believes not, triggering a vigorous debate after he laid out his arguments in a social media post.\n\nHe took issue with the much vaunted “e-points” scheme, whereby Ukraine’s units earn points for each Russian soldier killed or piece of materiel destroyed. The points are exchanged for new equipment, and the Defense Ministry says the scheme provides a wealth of data that helps shape future plans.\n\nBut O’Leary suggested they create the wrong incentives, causing Ukrainian commanders to prioritize more straightforward drone strikes against infantry targets around the line of combat, rather than tougher but more significant deep strikes against Russian logistics - like vehicles and communication hubs, as well as Russian drone crews operating from rear positions.\n\n“Drone warfare is not about who hits more soldiers today … Operational depth is where wars are decided. If the enemy can move fuel, ammo, drones, crews, and repair vehicles 10 to 40 km behind the line without fear, they own depth even if they lose 5x the men in trenches,” O’Leary wrote on X.\n\nIn truth, his accusation lays bare Ukraine’s two key structural challenges.\n\nFirstly, in drone technology, operating tactics and countermeasures, Russia has caught up and is quite possibly ahead.\n\nWriting on Facebook, Oleksandr Karpyuk, an aerial reconnaissance officer in the 59th Separate Assault Brigade, complained that Ukraine had failed to capitalize on its early advantage in this space, particularly by not diversifying the number of radio frequencies used by its drones to transmit signals.\n\nConsequently, once Russia improved its electronic warfare (EW) technologies, it needed to jam just two frequencies to put a significant dent in Ukraine’s ability to fly drones behind Russian lines.\n\nIn addition, Karpyuk writes, Russia’s tactical air defense crews are much improved, and Moscow continues to benefit from taking a lead in developing fiber-optic drones, which are impervious to Ukraine’s own EW countermeasures, because they do not transmit signals.\n\nAnd then there is Ukraine’s manpower issue.\n\nThe infantry shortage is well known. Rob Lee of the Foreign Policy Research Institute estimates there are fewer than ten Ukrainian infantry soldiers per kilometer of front line. He also estimates that most brigades have at most 10% of their total personnel in the infantry. Traditionally, that number would be upwards of 30%.\n\nLee told KI Insights, a strategic intelligence unit powered by the Kyiv Independent, that even those low numbers have been enough to prevent a major breakthrough by Russian forces, which have succeeded only in making small, incremental advances.\n\nBut in a war where drones - not infantry - matter most, it is Ukraine’s shortfalls in drone crews that are most pressing, especially in the key battle for operational depth – the destruction of targets up to 25 miles (40 kilometers) behind the line of combat.\n\nIn a forthright defense of the fighters under his command, the head of Ukraine’s Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Forces, Robert Brovdi, said last week there needed to be a threefold increase in the number of drone operators. Just 30% of the frontline – which stretches 745 miles – is currently covered, he wrote on his Facebook page.\n\nFedorov, the new defense minister, acknowledges the scale of the problem, telling the Ukrainian parliament some 2 million people are ignoring their call-up papers, while 200,000 others have deserted.\n\nMuch now rests on his ability to address the manpower issue and to regain Ukraine’s technical edge, all the while ensuring he is hitting Zelensky’s targets.\n\n“Unless we constantly stay ahead of Russians in technology and battle tactics, I cannot say the chance we will prevail is high,” cautioned the former Ukrainian official.\n\nCNN’s Victoria Butenko and Daria Tarasova-Markina in Kyiv contributed to this report.",

    "description": "Russia increased natural gas exports to Europe via the TurkStream pipeline in January, even as overall gas sales hit a half-century low and the EU moved toward a full ban on Russian gas imports.",
    "fullText": "Russia’s natural gas exports via the TurkStream pipeline to Europe jumped by 10.3% in January from a year earlier, Reuters calculations showed on Monday, as Gazprom boosted supply via the only gas route left from Russia to the EU.\n\nLast month, Russian gas supply via TurkStream totaled 1.73 billion cubic meters (bcm), up from 1.57 bcm in January 2025, according to the calculations made by Reuters.\n\nWhat happened to Ukraine's gas transit deal?\n\nWhich European countries still receive Russian gas supplies?\n\nWhy did Russian gas exports via TurkStream increase?\n\nHow will EU sanctions affect Russian gas imports?\n\nOn January 1, 2025, Russian pipeline gas supply to Europe crumbled again, after Ukraine refused to extend the pipeline transit deal with Russia.\n\nRussian gas supply via pipelines to Europe has slumped since 2022, after Russia cut off many EU customers from its gas deliveries, and Nord Stream stopped supplying gas to Germany, after Russia reduced flows and after a sabotage in September 2022.\n\nRussian pipeline gas supply via Ukraine stopped on January 1, 2025, after Ukraine refused to negotiate an extension to the transit deal.\n\nThat left only TurkStream as the conduit of Russian natural gas via pipeline to Europe.\n\nSome European countries, including Hungary and Slovakia, continue to receive Russian gas through the TurkStream pipeline via Turkey and the Balkans.\n\nSupplies via TurkStream have increased over the past year.\n\nDaily flows in January 2026 averaged 55.8 million cubic meters (mcm), up from 50.6 mcm in January 2025, per the Reuters calculations based on data from European gas transmission group Entsog. December 2025 flows averaged 56 mcm per day, so the past two months have seen consistent flows via TurkStream.\n\nDespite higher gas flows on TurkStream, Russia’s gas sales to Europe last year plunged to a 50-year low, after crashing by 44% from 2024 in the absence of transit via Ukraine.\n\nMoreover, the 27 EU member states last month formally adopted the regulation on phasing out Russian imports of both pipeline gas and LNG into the EU. A full ban will take effect for LNG imports from the beginning of 2027 and for pipeline gas imports from the autumn of 2027.\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\n\nU.S. Considers Sanctions Relief to Revive Venezuela’s Oil Output\n\nCrude Rallies on Weather Disruptions and Fresh Geopolitical Nerves\n\nBrent Breaks $70 After Trump Threatens Iran With Military Force\n\nOilprice Intelligence brings you the signals before they become front-page news.

    "fullText": "NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — There’s a chance the dreaded buzz of propellers heard on Ukrainian battlefields is coming from drones built in a country with a population of just over a million on Europe’s southeastern fringe: Cyprus.\n\nManufacturer Swarmly says there are more than 200 of its H-10 Poseidon drones helping Ukrainian artillery batteries pinpoint enemy targets on the ground in all kinds of weather, racking up more than 100,000 hours in the air over the last three years.\n\nIts 5,000-square-meter (54,000-square-foot) factory, where the whir of grinders shaping composite plastics reverberates off the walls, has become a major source of uncrewed vehicles shipped to countries such as Indonesia, Benin, Nigeria, India and Saudi Arabia, according to company officials. Most of the factory floor is reserved for uncrewed aerial vehicle manufacture. But tucked in a secure storage area is a selection of Swarmly's super-fast marine drones replete with high-definition cameras and .50-caliber machine guns.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has driven even the smallest European Union member countries to develop their home-grown, high-tech defense industries, just as necessity has made Kyiv a world leader in cutting-edge UAV technology. Many EU countries have partnered with Kyiv to develop that technology, and Ukraine’s front lines are usually their testing grounds.\n\nLike Cyprus, the Baltic countries and Denmark have revved up their domestic drone and counter-drone technology. In Greece, drones are part of a 25-billion euro ($29-billion) overhaul of its armed forces.\n\n“The example of Swarmy, as well as other important companies based in small EU countries, is a testament to the serious effort made by the private sector in Europe to innovate and build mass production capacity of defense items, including uncrewed systems,” said Federico Borsari, an expert with the Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis.\n\nUAVs are reshaping warfare by offering less militarily capable countries some leverage over superior adversaries. Drones aren't going to completely replace big-ticket weaponry like tanks, artillery and warplanes, said Borsari. But they offer flexibility and bang for the buck, making them a formidable force multiplier.\n\nTake Swarmly's explosives-packed, satellite-guided Hydra marine drone. Each one costs 80,000 euros ($94,500), which means deploying a group of them to neutralize a billion-euro warship can be a bargain, said company director Gary Rafalovsky.\n\nThis sort of naval weapon taking out a much larger warship is already evidenced by Houthi attacks from Yemen, according to Fabian Hinz, a research fellow for missile technologies and UAVs at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Europe.\n\nBarriers to entry for undercapitalized companies are low, he added, because UAVs are often designed and assembled from components cheaply and readily available on the global market.\n\n“And that, of course, means that basically you don’t have to have a great industrial investment at first that you need with other military capabilities. You don’t need decades of experience in certain material sciences or these kinds of things,” Hinz said.\n\nIn Denmark, a pair of companies focusing on anti-drone devices have reported a surge in new clients, and some of the devices were to be shipped to Ukraine to assist in jamming Russian technology on the battlefield. Ukraine in September said it was partnering with Danish companies to build missile and drone components at a factory in Denmark.\n\nIn the Baltic country of Lithuania, scientists and business partners have joined forces under the name VILNIUS TECH to develop UAVs, automated mine detection and other military technologies. The state-run ammunition factory Giraite says it has increased production capacity by 50% since 2022.\n\nGreece for the first time showcased its homemade drones and counter-drone technology during a full tactical exercise in November as NATO urged Europe's defense sector to pick up the pace.\n\n“We need capabilities, equipment, real firepower and the most advanced technology,” NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte warned during a visit to Romania earlier that month. “Bring your ideas, test your ingenuity and use NATO as your test bed.”\n\nEven as drone development accelerates, Borsari cautioned that the advantages of UAVs are often tempered by numerous variables like the harsh conditions in which they sometimes fly, operators’ training and skill levels, as well as the depth of logistical support to keep them functional.\n\nRussia's war in Ukraine and the Trump administration’s mixed messages that have strained relations with NATO allies have forced European leaders to reckon with the need to become more self-reliant on defense. So the EU has made billions of euros available to encourage investment and bolster its collective deterrent capability.\n\nThat's been a boost to nations like Cyprus, which assumed the six-month EU presidency on Jan. 1. Last week, the EU’s executive arm approved financial assistance for eight members including Spain, Croatia, Portugal, Bulgaria, Belgium, Romania and Cyprus.\n\nCyprus is set to receive final approval from EU leaders for some 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in low-cost, long-term loans under the EU’s 150-billion-euro joint ($177-billion) procurement program called Security Action for Europe (SAFE).\n\nIts nascent defense industry is already made up of around 30 companies and research centers that produce technology for both civilian and military sectors, including robotics, communications networks, anti-drone systems and even satellite communications and surveillance, said Panayiotis Hadjipavlis, chief of the armaments and defense capabilities development directorate within Cyprus' Defense Ministry.\n\n“We have niche capabilities on very high-tech products and this has to be taken seriously into account,” Hadjipavlis told The Associated Press in his office, where the helmet from his fighter pilot days hung on a nearby coat rack.\n\nMajor defense industry players, he added, are among those who should take note.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Russia has largely observed a ceasefire on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday as Kyiv prepared for the next round of trilateral talks on how ​to end the war.\n\nZelenskiy said that Russia had not carried out any targeted missile or drone strikes ‌on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in the past 24 hours, but steady Russian shelling hit energy facilities near the front line.\n\n\"The de-escalation measures... are ‌helping to build public trust in the negotiation process and its possible outcome. The war needs to be ended,\" Zelenskiy said after he met his negotiating team ahead of the next round of peace talks with Russian and U.S. officials scheduled to take place this week in Abu Dhabi. \"Ukraine is ready for real steps. We believe it is realistic to achieve a ⁠dignified and lasting peace.\"\n\nIn his nightly ‌video address, Zelenskiy noted that Russian forces had continued to shell Ukrainian positions and logistics, damaging transmission lines and other sites in parts of the southeastern Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions.\n\nHe ‍said the pause in strikes on energy infrastructure underscored the fact that U.S. efforts to pursue negotiations to end the war were having an impact.\n\n\"This demonstrates that when the United States has the motivation to genuinely change the situation, the situation can indeed ​change,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\nRussia and Ukraine said last week they halted strikes on each other's energy infrastructure, but disagreed ‌on the timeframe for the truce.\n\nThe Kremlin said U.S. President Donald Trump had made a personal request to Russian President Vladimir Putin to refrain from striking Kyiv until February 1. Zelenskiy said the truce was supposed to last for a week, starting January 30.\n\nUKRAINE STRUGGLES TO RESTORE POWER SUPPLIES\n\nUkraine is struggling to restore its battered energy system and secure electricity and heat for the population after several large Russian strikes this month. Repair work has been complicated by ⁠bitterly cold temperatures.\n\n\"Today we are coming to the critical point. We ​need some time to recover what is destroyed for the last ​three months,\" said Maxim Timchenko, CEO of private energy producer DTEK. \"Energy ceasefire is extremely important for us to recover partly and avoid any tragic consequences because of no power supply.\"\n\nDTEK said on ‍Monday one of its coal ⁠mining enterprises in the Dnipropetrovsk region had been attacked for the second time in 24 hours. The previous strike on Sunday killed 12 miners, the company said.\n\nZelenskiy also said Russian forces were focusing on ⁠attacking transport logistics, especially railway infrastructure.\n\nRegional officials said that a Russian strike had killed a father and a son, and wounded two children and ‌their mother in the frontline Donetsk region.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A new round of U.S.-brokered talks on ending Russia’s war on Ukraine is set to go ahead this week after a brief postponement, a senior Kremlin official said Monday, with negotiations taking place against a backdrop of continued front-line fighting and deadly long-range attacks on rear areas.\n\nThe trilateral talks will take place on Wednesday and Thursday in Abu Dhabi, where a previous meeting was held last month, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday that he would be sending a delegation to the meeting, which initially was to be held at the weekend but was delayed by what Peskov said were scheduling conflicts.\n\nThe Trump administration has over the past year pushed the two sides to find compromises. But breaking the deadlock on key issues appears no closer as the fourth anniversary of Russia’s all-out invasion of its neighbor approaches later this month.\n\nPeskov described the talks as “very complex.”\n\n“On some issues, we have certainly come closer because there have been discussions, conversations, and on some issues it is easier to find common ground,” he told reporters. “There are issues where it’s more difficult to find common ground.”\n\nRussian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev was in Miami, Florida, at the weekend for talks with American officials, but Peskov refused to provide any details of the meeting.\n\nA key sticking point is whether Russia gets to keep the Ukrainian territory its army has occupied, especially in Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland. Moscow is also demanding possession of other Ukrainian land there that it hasn’t been able to capture.\n\nRussian drones and missiles have continued to bombard civilian areas , killing 12 miners in a bus on Sunday in the most recent mass aerial attack. The barrages have also wrecked the Ukrainian power grid, leaving people without heating, light and running water in bitter winter cold.\n\nDefense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said Monday that authorities are taking steps to prevent Russia using Starlink satellite services to steer its drones toward their targets.\n\nFedorov asked Elon Musk’s SpaceX to help deny Russia use of the service in Ukraine. Starlink is a global internet network that relies on around 10,000 satellites orbiting Earth.\n\nUkraine is requiring civilian and military Starlink users to register their terminals on a database, allowing approved devices to function while unregistered terminals would be disabled inside Ukraine, Fedorov said.\n\n“Looks like the steps we took to stop the unauthorized use of Starlink by Russia have worked,” Musk said Sunday on X. “Let us know if more needs to be done.”\n\nLitvinova contributed from Tallinn, Estonia.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — European allies and Canada are pouring billions of dollars into helping Ukraine, and they have pledged to massively boost their budgets to defend their territories.\n\nBut despite those efforts, NATO’s credibility as a unified force under U.S. leadership has taken a huge hit over the past year as trust within the 32-nation military organization dissolved.\n\nThe rift has been most glaring over U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated threats to seize Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark. More recently, Trump's disparaging remarks about his NATO allies' troops in Afghanistan drew another outcry.\n\nWhile the heat on Greenland has subsided for now, the infighting has seriously undercut the ability of the world’s biggest security alliance to deter adversaries, analysts say.\n\n“The episode matters because it crossed a line that cannot be uncrossed,” Sophia Besch from the Carnegie Europe think tank said in a report on the Greenland crisis. “Even without force or sanctions, that breach weakens the alliance in a lasting way.”\n\nThe tensions haven’t gone unnoticed in Russia, NATO’s biggest threat.\n\nAny deterrence of Russia relies on ensuring that President Vladimir Putin is convinced that NATO will retaliate should he expand his war beyond Ukraine. Right now, that does not seem to be the case.\n\n“It’s a major upheaval for Europe, and we are watching it,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov noted last week.\n\nCriticized by U.S. leaders for decades over low defense spending, and lashed relentlessly under Trump, European allies and Canada agreed in July to significantly up their game and start investing 5% of their gross domestic product on defense.\n\nThe pledge was aimed at taking the whip out of Trump's hand. The allies would spend as much of their economic output on core defense as the United States — around 3.5% of GDP — by 2035, plus a further 1.5% on security-related projects like upgrading bridges, air and seaports.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has hailed those pledges as a sign of NATO’s robust health and military might. He recently said that “fundamentally thanks to Donald J. Trump, NATO is stronger than it ever was.”\n\nThough a big part of his job is to ensure that Trump does not pull the U.S. out of NATO, as Trump has occasionally threatened, his flattery of the American leader has sometimes raised concern. Rutte has pointedly refused to speak about the rift over Greenland.\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization was formed in 1949 to counter the security threat posed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and its deterrence is underpinned by a strong American troop presence in Europe.\n\nThe alliance is built on the political pledge that an attack on one ally must be met with a response from them all — the collective security guarantee enshrined in Article 5 of its rule book.\n\nIt hinges on the belief that the territories of all 32 allies must remain inviolate. Trump’s designs on Greenland attack that very principle, even though Article 5 does not apply in internal disputes because it can only be triggered unanimously.\n\n“Instead of strengthening our alliances, threats against Greenland and NATO are undermining America’s own interests,” two U.S. senators, Democrat Jeanne Shaheen and Republican Lisa Murkowski, wrote in a New York Times op-ed.\n\n“Suggestions that the United States would seize or coerce allies to sell territory do not project strength. They signal unpredictability, weaken deterrence and hand our adversaries exactly what they want: proof that democratic alliances are fragile and unreliable,” they said.\n\nEven before Trump escalated his threats to seize control of Greenland, his European allies were never entirely convinced that he would defend them should they come under attack.\n\nTrump has said that he doesn’t believe the allies would help him either, and he recently drew more anger when he questioned the role of European and Canadian troops who fought and died alongside Americans in Afghanistan. The president later partially reversed his remarks.\n\nIn testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio dismissed criticism that Trump has undermined the alliance.\n\n“The stronger our partners are in NATO, the more flexibility the United States will have to secure our interests in different parts of the world,” he said. “That’s not an abandonment of NATO. That is a reality of the 21st century and a world that’s changing now.”\n\nDespite NATO’s talk of increased spending, Moscow seems undeterred. The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said this week that “it has become painfully clear that Russia will remain a major security threat for the long term.”\n\n“We are fending off cyberattacks, sabotage against critical infrastructure, foreign interference and information manipulation, military intimidation, territorial threats and political meddling,” she said Wednesday.\n\nOfficials across Europe have reported acts of sabotage and mysterious drone flights over airports and military bases. Identifying the culprits is difficult, and Russia denies responsibility.\n\nIn a year-end address, Rutte warned that Europe is at imminent risk.\n\n“Russia has brought war back to Europe, and we must be prepared for the scale of war our grandparents or great-grandparents endured,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile in Russia, Lavrov said the dispute over Greenland heralded a “deep crisis” for NATO.\n\n“It was hard to imagine before that such a thing could happen,” Lavrov told reporters, as he contemplated the possibility that “one NATO member is going to attack another NATO member.”\n\nRussian state media mocked Europe's “impotent rage” over Trump's designs on Greenland, and Putin's presidential envoy declared that “trans-Atlantic unity is over.”\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is due to meet with his counterparts at NATO on Feb. 12. A year ago, he startled the allies by warning that America’s security priorities lie elsewhere and that Europe must look after itself now.\n\nSecurity in the Arctic region, where Greenland lies, will be high on the agenda. It’s unclear whether Hegseth will announce a new drawdown of U.S. troops in Europe, who are central to NATO’s deterrence.\n\nLack of clarity about this has also fueled doubt about the U.S. commitment to its allies. In October, NATO learned that up to 1,500 American troops would be withdrawn from an area bordering Ukraine, angering ally Romania.\n\nA report from the European Union Institute for Security Studies warned last week that although U.S. troops are unlikely to vanish overnight, doubts about U.S. commitment to European security means “the deterrence edifice becomes shakier.”\n\n“Europe is being forced to confront a harsher reality,” wrote the authors, Veronica Anghel and Giuseppe Spatafora. “Adversaries start believing they can probe, sabotage and escalate without triggering a unified response.\"",

    "fullText": "Kelluu began, as startups often do, in an old shed.\n\nThe small Finnish company makes airships — think van-sized blimps — originally designed to watch over power lines with cameras.\n\nWhen I met the firm's CEO, Janne Hietala, last fall, he arrived at our restaurant in Joensuu with news. Kelluu, a seven-year-old company, had just become a defense contractor.\n\nA NATO member had agreed to buy airships for surveillance under an alliance program pushing Western militaries to adopt new tech. The buyer hasn't been named, but it plans to integrate the airships into its military within two years.\n\nKelluu's ascent was just as rapid. The company's first showcase to NATO, Hietala said, was in November 2024.\n\nKelluu is trying to make it big in a market that hasn't been kind to small firms. Traditionally, Western nations have depended on giant contractors that meticulously take decades to create and fine-tune systems. These firms, often referred to as the \"primes,\" had all of the contacts and, by extension, all the business.\n\nBut now, the door is opening for founders from the commercial world.\n\nEvents in the last few years — the invasion of Ukraine, the second Trump administration, and the rise of drone warfare — have jolted NATO militaries, who now fear an overreliance on the primes. European generals and politicians alike agree: To convince Russia that it would lose a war, the continent needs a steady stream of ammo and equipment that can be quickly designed, tweaked, and produced in large quantities.\n\n\"It's no longer possible to just adhere to the old pace of months and years of planning, months or years of procurement, months or years of development,\" a spokesperson for Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic, or DIANA, the NATO agency that connected Kelluu with alliance members, told me.\n\nNATO conceptualized DIANA before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, as a program for emerging firms to present their tech to allied militaries and potentially sign contracts. Following the outbreak of the war, the agency was established in 2023.\n\nThe agency said it received 4,000 applications for its next cohort, up from 2,400 last year and 1,200 in its inaugural batch in 2023. At least half of these firms and founders are from Europe.\n\nInvestors who once viewed the defense sector as taboo are scouring the industry. According to the NATO Innovation Fund in February, venture capital investments in European defense tech reached $1 billion in 2024, up by four times since 2020.\n\nI traveled in the fall of 2025 to northern Europe, where concerns about war with Russia run high, to speak with defense startups finding their corner of a market that was closed to them five years ago. To make it in the old defense world, small firms typically needed to be bought by a prime.\n\nWith that barrier fading, the founders I spoke to have set their ambitions high. The European Union has a new goal of allocating $920 billion more to defense by 2030, and NATO members are raising their commitment to spending 5% of GDP on their militaries.\n\n\"No wonder that even the US investors are now looking at the European landscape, which wasn't a thing a year ago,\" Hietala said.\n\nRead this collection to get to know some of the startups seeking a slice of Europe's expanding war chest:",

And that is why contacts with Americans have become much more productive.\"\n\nMedvedev said the key to understanding Trump was his business background, quipping that there was no such thing as a former businessman - a play on an old Russian joke that there is no such thing as a former KGB agent.\n\nTrump in August said he had ordered two U.S. nuclear submarines to move closer to Russia in response to what he called \"highly provocative\" comments from Medvedev about the risk of war after what appeared to be an ultimatum from Trump.\n\n\"We still have not found them,\" Medvedev said of the U.S. submarines.\n\nAfter Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Medvedev has repeatedly hurled invective at Kyiv and Western powers while warning of the risks of an escalation of the war towards a nuclear \"apocalypse\".\n\nMedvedev said Russia would \"soon\" win military victory in the Ukraine war but the key thing was to prevent any further conflict, adding: \"I would like this to happen as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"But it is equally important to think about what will happen next. After all, the goal of victory is to prevent new conflicts. This is absolutely obvious.\"\n\nRussia currently controls a fifth of Ukraine but has so far been unable to take the whole of the eastern Donbas region, where Ukrainian forces hold about 10%, or 5,000 square km (1,900 square miles), according to open-source maps of the war.",

    "title": "Russia's Oil Revenue, the Lifeblood of Its War Machine, Is Plummeting",
    "description": "The new reality has forced the Kremlin to raise taxes and increase debt, and hovers over peace talks with Ukraine.",
    "fullText": "As Russia holds direct peace talks with Ukraine for the first time in months, the Kremlin’s most potent fuel for the war, oil revenue, is under mounting strain.\n\nThe price of Russian oil, the country’s primary export, has declined under the weight of surging global supplies and Western sanctions related to the war. Last year, Russia’s oil and gas revenue fell by almost a quarter, according to the Finance Ministry. The Kremlin is resorting to tax increases and deficit spending to bridge the gap.\n\nSo far, there is little sign that the economic strains, and any discontent they generate among business leaders and the public, will be enough to change President Vladimir V. Putin’s calculations on the war. Trilateral negotiations involving Russia, Ukraine and the United States are set to continue on Sunday in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nBut with the economy stagnating and the Kremlin reaching the limit of what it can squeeze from it, the Russian people will have to bear more of the burden of a war whose costs exceed about $170 billion a year.\n\n“This situation is manageable,” said Yevgeny Nadorshin, an economist in Moscow who advises companies and banks. “But no one is comfortable with that.”\n\nThroughout his decades-long rule, Mr. Putin has taken pride in the stability he has brought to a Russian economy that was in free fall after the demise of the Soviet Union — slashing debt, streamlining taxes and taming inflation.\n\nA strong oil economy allowed the Russian state to deliver an improved standard of living. That, the Kremlin hoped, would keep the public content even as the government eroded personal freedoms.\n\nNow, the carefully cultivated economic stability is fracturing. The steep drop in oil revenue has sent Russia into a new era defined by sustained budget deficits, higher taxes and stubborn inflation.\n\nRussia’s oil trade has been battered by two forces. Oil prices have declined since April, after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided to gradually increase production after years of cuts. The Russian oil industry has also been hit in recent months by new Western sanctions and the heavier enforcement of existing ones.\n\nIn October, President Trump imposed sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft, which is state-owned, and Lukoil, which is private. Those penalties significantly undercut the companies’ ability to sell crude. Since then, Russia has also faced stepped-up enforcement of restrictions against the illicit “shadow fleet” of tankers it uses to ship oil.\n\nThis month, the U.S. military seized a Russian-flagged vessel in the North Atlantic that had been used to carry Venezuelan oil. The French Navy also intercepted a tanker in the Mediterranean suspected of using a false flag and belonging to a Russia-linked fleet.\n\nBecause of the current global oversupply, buyers now have more alternatives to Russian crude. This allows them to either walk away entirely or demand significantly higher discounts to compensate for the risk of handling goods hit with sanctions, said Sergey Vakulenko, an energy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n“Had it not been for this noticeable decrease in oil prices,” he said, “all these measures would have been far less effective.”\n\nDiscounts on Russian oil have grown drastically. The economy ministry said this month that the average price of Russian oil was $39 per barrel in December, down from more than $57 in August.\n\nAdding to Moscow’s problems, Ukraine has been using drones since November to strike Russia-linked tankers in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. The Ukrainian military has also been attacking Russian refineries. That has contributed to fuel crises in several regions, forcing the government to temporarily ban the export of oil products.\n\n“The only factor that can change the situation is economic pressure on Russia,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said on Friday. “Russia must run out of money for the war to start coming to an end.”\n\nThis is not the first time that Mr. Putin has dealt with a drop in oil prices. But in previous years, the Russian state had more options. It could cut expenditures or allow the currency to weaken to replenish the budget. But the costs of the war, which amount to about 30 percent of Russia’s $580 billion annual budget, make it hard to reduce expenses. And the currency, the ruble, has remained strong.\n\nPropped up by restrictions on imports and high interest rates, the ruble surged by about 45 percent against the U.S. dollar in 2025. A strong ruble means that the government receives less money for each barrel of crude that is sold.\n\nWith options dwindling, the Kremlin had little choice but to increase state debt as well as personal and corporate taxes. The Russian government also increased taxes on smaller enterprises like bakeries and shops, causing a rare uproar among owners.\n\nRussia’s budget deficit reached $72 billion in 2025, nominally the highest since 2009. Mr. Nadorshin, the economist, said he expected it to increase further this year.\n\n“The situation is becoming more complicated,” he said, “and it’s clear that the pace of this complication is, naturally, worrying.”",

Musk turned on Starlink service over Ukraine in 2022 ‍after Kyiv pleaded for help in the first days following Russia's full-scale invasion.\n\nDespite Musk's subsequent clashes with Ukrainian officials over his views on the war, Ukraine's military still relies on tens of thousands of Starlinks for battlefield communication and for piloting ​some drone missions.\n\nThey are favoured for their stable connection on the battlefield and for their resistance to ‌enemy signal jamming.\n\nIn a social media post in February 2024, SpaceX said it does not sell or ship Starlink to Russia, and \"does not do business of any kind with the Russian Government or its military\".\n\nThe U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War said it had seen reports of Russia using Starlink-equipped Shahed long-range drones beginning in September 2024.\n\n'HUNDREDS' OF STARLINK-EQUIPPED DRONES\n\nSerhiy Beskrestnov, a newly appointed adviser to Fedorov, drew attention to the issue ⁠over the past week by posting pictures on social media ​of the wreckage of long-range Russian drones, including Shaheds, with Starlink ​terminals.\n\nOn Tuesday, Beskrestnov said that Shahed drones manually flown by pilots, possibly through Starlink, had attacked a passenger train in northeastern Ukraine. That attack killed five people, and was denounced ‍by Kyiv as an act ⁠of terrorism.\n\nOn Thursday, Beskrestnov said there had been \"hundreds\" of cases where Starlink-enabled Russian drones had attacked Ukraine.\n\n\"The complexity of this process lies in the fact that Starlink cannot be suppressed by means of ⁠electronic warfare, and even their position in flight cannot be detected by reconnaissance equipment,\" he wrote, adding that the way to solve ‌the issue was therefore through SpaceX.",

    "description": "A Ukrainian soldier, until recently a drone operator, broke down what he carried in battle to stay alive, stay comfortable, and fight Russia.",
    "fullText": "A Ukrainian soldier, until recently a drone operator, shared a video earlier this month walking viewers through the gear he carried with him into battle against the Russians.\n\nIt featured an interesting mix of stuff, from drone detectors to weaponry to what he characterized as \"tactical Crocs.\"\n\nDimko Zhluktenko, now an analyst with Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces, spoke to Business Insider about the items that he considers key to staying alive, comfortable, and as effective as possible against Russia. He still carries a lot of the gear with him, even though his role has changed.\n\nHe picks his gear with great care, emphasizing that much of what he carries was his choice, not government-issued.\n\n\"The stuff that the government issues sometimes is good, but it's not the best fit.\" He said the military largely trusts soldiers to choose what works best for them.\n\nZhluktenko, who worked in tech before the war, said his gear comes from a mix of state funding, items he bought himself, and crowdfunding. He tries to keep what he carries on his person to around 10 kilograms, calling it \"a comfortable amount of gear that is still extremely useful,\" though he can carry more when needed.\n\nThis war has seen low-tech solutions fielded against cutting-edge weapons, such as wire mesh and cages used to stop advanced drones, or wooden decoy tanks designed to fool expensive munitions.\n\nAs a drone operator, Zhluktenko carried a pair of scissors to sever the cables of fiber-optic drones that now litter the battlefield as these jamming-resistant drones become increasingly prevalent.\n\nCutting the cables \"became a part of our standard operating procedure\" in areas saturated with fiber-optic drones, he said. Units are sometimes instructed to cut \"each and every\" cable they see, just in case.\n\nZhluktenko said that they don't even worry about friend or foe concerns. Similar responses have been seen with the radio-frequency drones, with soldiers panic-jamming everything regardless of who the systems belong to.\n\nZhluktenko said that he bought retractors for all his team so they wouldn't lose their scissors.\n\nHe carried an issued firearm — an old Soviet-designed weapon — which is good enough for his role because he doesn't operate in areas with much direct fighting.\n\nHe said it is \"much older than I am,\" but noted that he modified it and \"it's not too bad.\" He replaced some internal components and the handguard, adding one from Ukrainian manufacturer Kpyk to improve grip. He said its primary use is targeting drones that can't be stopped in other ways. Gunfights are not the norm in this war.\n\nHe also carried extra magazines and a pouch for empty ones.\n\nTo improve dexterity, he wore silicone-grip gloves from the American company Mechanix Wear, which make it easier to operate drone controllers. The grip provides \"extra sensitivity\" for precise movements and prevents slipping.\n\nHe carried a mechanical compass because Russia's electromagnetic warfare throws off the ones in his iPhone and Garmin.\n\nAnd Zhluktenko also had sunglasses, since spotting his own drone in a crowded sky is critical and the \"sun is a big factor.\"\n\nZhluktenko had a pair of shoes he brought with him that resemble the American-designed footwear Crocs, but his are made by a Ukrainian company, M-Tac. He said they are \"absolutely essential\" because it's impossible to wear combat boots all the time.\n\nHe called them \"tactical Crocs,\" explaining that he only breaks them out in moments when the threat is low.\n\nWhen it was time to get to work, he would wear combat boots made by the German company Lowa. He said he had been using these boots for around four years, along with orthopedic insoles. He said that he can wear them all day without pain.\n\nHe also carried hand sanitizer — \"you probably remember those from COVID era, but I still use them at war,\" he said, — a multitool that includes a knife and spoon to eat with, and a cap to protect him \"from excessive sun\" in the field.\n\nZhluktenko said he carried a drone detector, an electronic system that scans radio frequencies to detect incoming drones. He said it can alert him if a drone is flying toward him and sometimes show the video feed from the enemy drone, revealing what it is seeing.\n\nUkraine has bigger systems in place to try to warn soldiers of incoming drones, but they can sometimes miss one. Even if they don't get a warning from command posts, \"there might be just some random FPV drone that just flew in and might damage us.\" He explained that these drone detectors are \"becoming more and more essential\" and are needed \"ASAP.\"\n\nHe also carried a Motorola radio, a \"basic\" one where he can talk with his brothers in arms, and night vision goggles that he uses for nighttime drone launches and landings.\n\nHe put a GoPro on his chest so he can rewatch his actions for improvements, almost like sports teams do with replays.\n\nZhluktenko also has a Ukrainian-made MITLA anti-drone gun, which shoots nets to stop drones flying toward him by snagging their propellers. He said he got his recently and has never had to use it. It's a single-use product that was released this year.\n\nAnd he carried electrical tape \"because there is always something that you could fix\" when it comes to his technology and other gear.\n\nZhluktenko said that his body armor is the \"most important\" piece of gear that he carries, regardless of his role. He bought and selected it himself.\n\n\"I didn't use whatever the government gave to me,\" he said. \"It wasn't bad, but it wasn't a good fit.\"\n\nHe chose a system that allows for extensive customization. He uses armor from M-Tac and added components such as a weight-distribution system from the Ukrainian company Balistyka, which attaches to the vest and gives him \"the flexibility to move around much better.\" Most of the injuries in battle come from shrapnel, so he wanted to protect as much of his body as possible without limiting his ability to move quickly.\n\nHe customized his armor with additional panels to protect areas like his stomach, spine, ribs, and hips, areas where a tourniquet can't easily be applied. He shared that many soldiers use neck protection, but he found it didn't offer enough freedom of movement.\n\nHe also wears glasses with ballistic protection to shield against shrapnel.\n\nHe uses a \"very lightweight\" helmet from Team Wendy, which supports his night-vision goggles. He said weight is important to him so that it doesn't strain his neck.\n\nHe also carries tourniquets and bandages. The first, on a battlefield where medical evacuation and trauma care are likely not readily available, is crucial for staying alive. He said these tools — he carried four on his person at the time of filming — are among his \"most important stuff.\"\n\nZhluktenko carried a \"proper knife\" that he said is old and getting \"a bit rusty\" but still works well enough, along with a multitool that includes features like a small saw. A follower on X sent it to him. He also uses a carabiner to carry extra gear.\n\nHe carried zipties and padlocks so his unit could take over and secure vacant positions. Many positions have doors, and they would lock them and write on the door which unit took it, along with their call sign and phone number.\n\nHe also carried a flashlight with red and white modes made by a friend's company, Syaivo, which gives them to Ukrainian soldiers for free. He also had two other flashlights that he could put on his helmet and armor.",

    "description": "Moscow says it's been gaining momentum, but the researchers said even its advance in Pokrovsk was slower than the Allies' in the Battle of the Somme.",
    "fullText": "Russia's rate of advance over the last two years, even during its fiercest offensive campaigns, has been among the slowest in modern war, per a new analysis by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nThe assessment by CSIS researchers Seth G. Jones and Riley McCabe, published on Tuesday, examined Russia's three major pushes on the front lines following its seizure of Avdiivka in February 2024.\n\n\"After seizing the initiative in 2024, Russian forces have advanced at an average rate of between 15 and 70 meters per day in their most prominent offensives, slower than almost any major offensive campaign in any war in the last century,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nThey used their findings to dispute recent statements by Russian leaders, including the country's president, Vladimir Putin, that the Kremlin has been gaining significant momentum in recent months.\n\nThese three offensive directions — toward Kupiansk in northern Ukraine and Pokrovsk and Chasiv Yar in the east — have been the source of the war's most intense battlegrounds in the last two years.\n\nRussian forces have said at various stages in 2025 that they'd taken all three major hubs, though Ukraine says that it still maintains pockets of fighting presence there and has been pushing back.\n\nBut even in Pokrovsk, where Russia advanced the fastest, the Kremlin's troops took roughly 70 meters of territory per day, totaling 50 kilometers, or roughly 31 miles, over the last two years, Jones and McCabe wrote.\n\nThe pair calculated the rate of advance based on the straight-line distance by which battle territory shifted, which doesn't account for the total area of territory seized.\n\nBased on this method, Jones and McCabe assessed a Russian rate of advance of 23 meters per day for Kupiansk and 15 meters per day for Chasiv Yar.\n\nAll three were slower than the brutal five-month French and British advance at the Somme in World War I, which took an average of 80 meters of German territory per day, researchers wrote.\n\nCompared with other major combined-arms offensives in modern history, Russia's recent advances have been \"moving at mere fractions of the pace of historical campaigns,\" they added.\n\nJones and McCabe highlighted the Soviet Union's advance on the Leningrad front in 1943, which they said progressed at an average pace of 1,000 meters a day, and the 1918 Battle of Belleau Wood, where they said US forces advanced 410 meters a day in Germany.\n\nUkraine's 2022 counteroffensive in Kharkiv, meanwhile, seized 7,400 meters a day, while its temporary incursion into Kursk took 1,250 meters a day, the researchers added.\n\nPart of the reason behind Russia's slow advance has been the nature of the war, Jones and McCabe noted. The attritive style of the conflict favors the defender heavily, especially with the mass introduction of first-person-view drones.\n\n\"The eastern front line, for instance, continues to be saturated with drones. As a result, vehicle movement is difficult within 15 kilometers of the front line,\" they wrote.\n\nTo be sure, Kyiv still faces a slew of emerging and severe challenges, including high rates of draft dodging and desertion, waning US military support, and Russia innovating with its attack drones to pound Ukrainian energy infrastructure in the winter.\n\nOverall, Russia has seized roughly 75,000 square kilometers, or 28,900 square miles, of Ukraine since its full-scale invasion began in 2022, Jones and McCabe wrote.\n\n\"These gains and Russia's overall progress on the battlefield, especially in the last two years, fall decisively short of Moscow's goal to militarily conquer Ukraine,\" the researchers added.\n\nStill, they added that a more recent Russian offensive toward the city of Huliaipole in the southern Zaporizhzhia region has been more successful.\n\nSince this push began in November 2025, Russia has been advancing there at an average rate of 297 meters a day, their assessment said.\n\nMoscow's high casualties in the last year or so, however, also pose another challenge to its ability to sustain its assault.\n\nRussian deaths and injuries on the battlefield have outnumbered Ukraine's by a ratio of 2:1 or even 2.5:1, Jones and McCabe wrote, citing figures from CSIS, the UK's defense ministry, and other sources such as news outlets and interviews with officials.\n\n\"There were roughly 415,000 Russian casualties in 2025 alone, with an average of nearly 35,000 casualties per month,\" they added.",

    "title": "Russian Scientists Test Plasma Engine That Could Cut Mars Travel to About 30 Days",
    "description": "Russia is testing a plasma engine prototype designed to slash Mars travel time to just 60 days. Developed by Rosatom’s Troitsk Institute, the system uses electromagnetic fields to accelerate particles to 100 km/s, promising a flight-ready model for deep-space missions by 2030.",
    "fullText": "Russia is quietly testing a new plasma propulsion system that, if it performs as claimed, could dramatically change how long it takes to travel to Mars. Early results suggest a leap in speed and efficiency that has drawn attention precisely because it is not coming from NASA or private U.S. companies such as SpaceX.\n\nThe engine is being developed by the Troitsk Institute, part of Russia’s state nuclear corporation Rosatom. According to researchers involved in the program, the system could reduce interplanetary travel time from several months to roughly one to two months. Ground-based testing is currently underway, and the developers say the technology could be ready for space deployment by around 2030.\n\nUnlike conventional chemical rockets, the new system relies on electromagnetic fields to accelerate charged hydrogen particles. This places it firmly in the category of electric or plasma propulsion, a field that has gained increasing global attention as space agencies look for more efficient ways to travel deeper into the solar system.\n\nChemical rockets deliver very high thrust for a short time, which is ideal for launching from Earth. However, they are inefficient for long-distance travel once a spacecraft is in orbit. Plasma engines, by contrast, generate much lower thrust but can operate continuously for long periods, gradually building up extremely high speeds while using far less propellant.\n\nIf the Russian system achieves its projected performance, it could have a major impact on how future missions to Mars and beyond are planned, both for scientific exploration and for potential military or logistical applications.\n\nThe prototype engine is currently being tested inside a 14-meter-long vacuum chamber designed to simulate space conditions. According to technical details reported by the Russian newspaper Izvestia, the engine operates at a power level of 300 kilowatts in a pulsed periodic mode and has already demonstrated a working lifespan of 2,400 hours. That duration would be sufficient for a full Mars mission, including acceleration and deceleration phases.\n\nResearchers say the engine accelerates charged hydrogen particles, including protons and electrons, to speeds of up to 100 kilometers per second. By comparison, traditional chemical rockets typically achieve exhaust velocities of around 4.5 kilometers per second. This massive difference in exhaust velocity is the key to the engine’s potential efficiency and speed.\n\nThe plasma engine is not intended to launch directly from Earth’s surface. A conventional chemical rocket would first carry the spacecraft into low Earth orbit. Once in space, the plasma engine would be activated to provide continuous thrust for the journey through deep space.\n\nOfficials involved in the project also note that the system could function as a space tug, moving cargo, modules, or satellites between different planetary orbits. This concept aligns with broader international interest in reusable orbital transport systems.\n\nThe engine uses hydrogen as propellant and relies on an onboard nuclear reactor to provide a constant energy supply. According to project researcher Yegor Biryulin, hydrogen’s low atomic mass allows for faster acceleration while reducing fuel consumption. Its abundance in space could eventually allow for in situ refueling, at least in theory.\n\nThe propulsion system uses two high-voltage electrodes to create directed plasma flow. Charged particles pass between them, forming a magnetic field that expels plasma and generates thrust. This design avoids the need to heat plasma to extreme temperatures, which reduces component wear and improves overall efficiency.\n\nRosatom documentation lists the projected thrust at 6 newtons, which is high for a plasma propulsion prototype. Even so, the thrust remains far lower than chemical rockets, meaning spacecraft would be designed for slow but continuous acceleration rather than short bursts of power.\n\nPlasma propulsion is already used in orbit on many satellites, including systems on OneWeb spacecraft and on NASA’s Psyche mission launched in 2023. Most existing plasma engines operate at exhaust velocities between 30 and 50 kilometers per second. The Russian claims of 100 kilometers per second would represent a significant step forward.\n\nHowever, the technology remains unproven in space. Peer-reviewed scientific data have not yet been published, and the nuclear reactor design has not been disclosed. Nuclear-powered spacecraft raise complex safety, regulatory, and international approval issues, especially during launch.\n\nWhile the concept is promising, the engine is still years away from practical use. Its projected readiness by 2030 will depend on continued testing, funding, and successful resolution of engineering and regulatory challenges.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Autorepublika.com and has been republished with permission by Guessing Headlights.

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A new report warns that the number of soldiers killed, injured or missing on both sides of Russia's war on Ukraine could hit 2 million by the spring, with Russia suffering the largest number of troop deaths recorded for any major power in any conflict since World War II.\n\nTuesday's report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies came less than a month before the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nAs the war grinds through another bitterly cold winter, Russian strikes hit an apartment block Wednesday on the outskirts of Kyiv, killing two people. Nine others were injured in attacks in the Ukrainian cities of Odesa and Kryvyi Rih and the front-line Zaporizhzhia region.\n\nThe CSIS report said Russia suffered 1.2 million casualties, including up to 325,000 troop deaths, between February 2022 and December 2025.\n\n“Despite claims of battlefield momentum in Ukraine, the data shows that Russia is paying an extraordinary price for minimal gains and is in decline as a major power,” the report said. “No major power has suffered anywhere near these numbers of casualties or fatalities in any war since World War II.\"\n\nIt estimated that Ukraine, with its smaller army and population, had suffered between 500,000 to 600,000 military casualties, including up to 140,000 deaths.\n\nNeither Moscow nor Kyiv gives timely data on military losses, and each side seeks to amplify the other side’s casualties.\n\nCommenting on the report, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that the research could not be considered “reliable information” and that only Russia’s Ministry of Defense was authorized to provide information on military losses.\n\nThe ministry’s last statement on battlefield deaths was in September 2022, when it said that just under 6,000 Russian soldiers had been killed. It has not released any updated figures since then.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn an interview with NBC in February 2025, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that more than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since the war began.\n\nThe report estimated that at current rates, combined Russian and Ukrainian casualties may be as high as 1.8 million and could reach 2 million by spring.\n\nThe figures from the CSIS were compiled using the Washington, D.C.-based think tank’s own analysis, data published by independent Russian news site Mediazona with the BBC, estimates by the British government and interviews with state officials.\n\nReports about military losses have been repressed in Russian media, activists and independent journalists say.\n\nMediazona, together with the BBC and a team of volunteers, has so far collected the names of over 160,000 troops killed by scouring news reports, social media and government websites.\n\nThe report also said that Russian forces were advancing at a sluggish pace since they seized the initiative on the battlefield in 2024, despite their much larger size.\n\nRussia’s advance in Ukraine has largely settled into a grinding war of attrition, and analysts say that Russian President Vladimir Putin is in no rush to find a settlement, despite his army’s difficulties on the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line.\n\nThe report said Russian forces have advanced at an average rate of between 15 and 70 meters (49 to 230 feet) per day in their most prominent offensives.\n\nThat is “slower than almost any major offensive campaign in any war in the last century,” the report said.\n\nPutin told his annual news conference last month that 700,000 Russian troops are fighting in Ukraine. He gave the same number in 2024, and a slightly lower figure — 617,000 — in December 2023. It was not possible to verify those figures.\n\n2 killed in attack in Kyiv region\n\nOfficials said Wednesday that two people were killed near the Ukrainian capital and at least nine others were injured in attacks across Ukraine.\n\nA man and a woman died in an overnight attack in the Bilohorodka area on the outskirts of Kyiv, according to Mykola Kalashnyk, head of the regional military administration.\n\nOfficials in the Ukrainian cities of Odesa and Kryvyi Rih, as well as the Zaporizhzhia region, also reported Russian strikes overnight, wounding at least nine people and damaging infrastructure.\n\nUkraine's air force said that Russia attacked overnight with one ballistic missile and 146 strike drones, 103 of which were shot down or destroyed using electronic warfare.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's Ministry of Defense said its air defenses destroyed 75 Ukrainian drones overnight. Twenty-four were shot down over Russia’s southwestern Krasnodar region, with 23 more shot down over the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed in 2016.\n\nTwo drones were reportedly shot down over Russia's Voronezh region, where Ukraine's General Staff said Wednesday that it had struck the Khokholskaya oil depot. Regional Gov. Alexander Gusev wrote on Telegram that falling drone debris sparked a fire involving oil products, but did not give further details.",

    "fullText": "At least four out of every five successful Ukrainian strikes against Russia's forces are being carried out by drones, said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday.\n\nThe new figure represents one of the highest official estimates of the involvement of drones in Ukraine's battlefield operations. In the spring of 2025, Ukrainian officials had said that roughly 70% of Russian casualties were inflicted by drones.\n\nSpeaking at an awards event for Ukrainian drone units, Zelenskyy said that the \"overwhelming majority\" of these drones were manufactured locally.\n\nIn a statement, Zelenskyy's office said that in 2025, Ukrainian troops had struck nearly 820,000 targets with drones.\n\n\"Each of these strikes is recorded, which helps not only with hit verification but also with the operation of the bonus-based system for assessing military performance,\" the statement said, referring to a new system that rewards drone squads for video-recording their battlefield engagements.\n\nFor every confirmed kill, drone units are assigned points that can be used to procure equipment.\n\nZelenskyy said that infantry and artillery were still important in the war, but \"everything is becoming extremely dependent\" on how quickly Kyiv can adapt and build new technologies.\n\n\"Our bonus-based electronic points system is working to scale up the results of our defense. In December, our units achieved a result of 35,000 neutralized occupiers,\" the Ukrainian leader said.\n\nUkrainian units that regularly report their battlefield performance have also suggested similar tallies for December.\n\nMaj. Robert \"Madyar\" Brovdi, the commander of Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces, said on Sunday that his units were responsible for a third of Ukraine's battlefield hits with drones, and had wounded or killed a daily average of 388 Russian soldiers in December.\n\nThat roughly translates to 34,900 casualties for the month.\n\nMykhailo Fedorov, who is now Ukraine's defense minister, previously said that he estimated up to 90% of battlefield kills in August could be attributed to drones. He was serving as minister for digital transformation at the time.\n\nUkraine aimed last year to manufacture roughly 2.5 million first-person-view drones, though some local estimates have also said it could target a capacity of up to 4.5 million. Officials have not said how many such drones were actually produced in 2025.\n\nKyiv has sought to aggressively expand and export its local drone manufacturing sector, and hopes to wean itself and the international market off Chinese products and parts.",

Officials in Kenya, South Africa and Iraq say the same has happened to citizens from their countries.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin told his annual news conference last month that 700,000 Russian troops are fighting in Ukraine. He gave the same number in 2024, and a slightly lower figure – 617,000 – in December 2023. It's unclear if those numbers are accurate.\n\nStill hidden are the numbers of military casualties, with Moscow having released limited official figures. The British Defense Ministry said last summer that more than 1 million Russian troops may have been killed or wounded.\n\nIndependent Russian news site Mediazona, together with the BBC and a team of volunteers, scoured news reports, social media and government websites and collected the names of over 160,000 troops killed. More than 550 of those were foreigners from over two dozen countries.\n\nUnlike Ukraine, where martial law and nationwide mobilization has been in place since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Putin has resisted ordering a broad call-up.\n\nWhen a limited mobilization of 300,000 men was tried later that year, tens of thousands of people fled abroad. The effort stopped after a few weeks when the target was met, but a Putin decree left the door open for another call-up. It also made all military contracts effectively open-ended and barred soldiers from quitting service or being discharged, unless they reached certain age limits or were incapacitated by injuries.\n\nSince then, Moscow has largely relied on what it describes as voluntary enlistment.\n\nThe flow of voluntary enlistees signing military contracts has remained strong, topping 400,000 last year, Putin said in December. It was not possible to independently verify the claim. Similar numbers were announced in 2024 and 2023.\n\nActivists say these contracts often stipulate a fixed term of service, such as one year, leading some potential enlistees to believe the commitment is temporary. But contracts are automatically extended indefinitely, they say.\n\nThe government offers high pay and extensive benefits to enlistees. Regional authorities offer various enlistment bonuses, sometimes amounting to tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nIn the Khanty-Mansi region of central Russia, for example, an enlistee would get about $50,000 in various bonuses, according to the local government. That's more than twice the average annual income in the region, where monthly salaries in the first 10 months of 2025 were reported to be just over $1,600.\n\nThere also are tax breaks, debt relief and other perks.\n\nDespite Kremlin claims of relying on voluntary enlistment, media reports and rights groups say conscripts — men aged 18-30 performing fixed-term mandatory military service and exempted from being sent to Ukraine — are often coerced by superiors into signing contracts that send them into battle.\n\nRecruitment also extends to prisoners and those in pretrial detention centers, a practice led early in the war by the late mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin and adopted by the Defense Ministry. Laws now allow recruitment of both convicts and suspects in criminal cases.\n\nForeigners also are recruiting targets, both inside Russia and abroad.\n\nLaws were adopted offering accelerated Russian citizenship for enlistees. Russian media and activists also report that raids in areas where migrants typically live or work lead to them being pressuring into military service, with new citizens sent to enlistment offices to determine if they’re eligible for mandatory service.\n\nIn November, Putin decreed that military service was mandatory for certain foreigners seeking permanent residency.\n\nSome reportedly are lured to Russia by trafficking rings promising jobs, then duping them into signing military contracts. Cuban authorities in 2023 identified and sought to dismantle one such ring operating from Russia.\n\nNepal’s Foreign Minister Narayan Prakash Saud told The Associated Press in 2024 that his country asked Russia to return hundreds of Nepali nationals who were recruited to fight in Ukraine, as well as to repatriate the remains of those killed in the war. Nepal has since barred citizens from traveling to Russia or Ukraine for work, citing recruitment efforts.\n\nAlso in 2024, India’s federal investigation agency said it broke up a network that lured at least 35 of its citizens to Russia under the pretext of employment. The men were trained for combat and deployed to Ukraine against their will, with some \"grievously injured,” the agency said.\n\nWhen Putin hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for talks in 2024, New Delhi said its nationals who were “misled” into joining the Russian army would be discharged.\n\nIraqi officials say about 5,000 of its citizens have joined the Russian military along with an unspecified number who are fighting alongside Ukrainian forces. Officials in Baghdad cracked down on such recruiting networks, with one man convicted last year of human trafficking and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nAn unknown number of Iraqis have been killed or gone missing while fighting in Ukraine. Some families have reported that relatives were lured to Russia under false pretenses and forced to enlist; in other cases, Iraqis have joined voluntarily for the salary and Russian citizenship.\n\nForeigners duped into fighting are especially vulnerable because they don’t speak Russian, have no military experience and are deemed “dispensable, to put it bluntly,” by military commanders, said Anton Gorbatsevich of the activist group Idite Lesom, or “Get Lost,” which helps men desert from the army.\n\nThis month, a Ukrainian agency for the treatment of prisoners of war said over 18,000 foreign nationals had fought or are fighting on the Russian side. Almost 3,400 have been killed, and hundreds of citizens of 40 countries are held in Ukraine as POWs.\n\nIf true, that represents a fraction of the 700,000 troops that Putin said are fighting for Russia in Ukraine.\n\nUsing foreigners is only one way to meet the constant demand, said Artyom Klyga, head of the legal department at the Movement of Conscientious Objectors, noting Russian recruitment efforts appear to be stable. Most of those seeking help from the group, which assists men in avoiding military service, are Russian citizens, he said.\n\nKateryna Stepanenko, a Russia researcher at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, said the Kremlin has gotten more “creative” in the last two years with attracting enlistees, including foreigners.\n\nBut recruitment efforts are becoming “extremely expensive” for Russia, which faces a slowing economy, she added.",

    "fullText": "Russia has admitted for the first time that a Ukrainian missile sank its prized Black Sea flagship, later deleting the statement and returning to the official narrative that the guided-missile cruiser Moskva went down because of a freak accident.\n\nThe Moskva was one of Russia’s most important warships when it sunk in April 2022, just seven weeks after Moscow launched its unprovoked, full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nKyiv was quick to claim it had hit the vessel with its Neptune anti-ship cruise missile, but Russia pushed a different narrative of the incident.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense always insisted the Moskva sank after a fire broke out and caused munitions aboard to explode. The Russian military said at the time that the crew of the warship was evacuated, although it later admitted some were missing.\n\nAccording to an independent Russian news outlet Mediazona, a military court in Moscow last week inadvertently corrected the Kremlin’s official narrative. The court, Mediazona said, issued a statement about the sentencing of a Ukrainian navy commander who ordered strikes against the Moskva and another ship, the Admiral Essen frigate. According to the court, he was sentenced to life in prison in absentia.\n\nThe statement was quickly wiped off the court’s website, but not before Mediazona managed to download it.\n\nThe loss of the Moskva was extremely embarrassing for Russia, marking one of Ukraine’s most significant wins of the war so far.\n\nCNN asked Russian authorities about the apparent backtracking. Irina Zhirnova, the spokesperson for the 2nd Western District Military Court, which would have issued the now-deleted statement, said there would be no comment. The Russian military did not respond to CNN’s request.\n\nMediazona has reported on the circumstances of the Moskva sinking extensively in the past, publishing testimonies from the families of sailors who were killed – and whose deaths were never officially acknowledged by the Russian military.\n\n“On April 13, 2022, a missile strike with two missiles hit the Guards missile cruiser Moskva, causing a fire and smoke filling the ship’s interior,” the court said in the statement, according to Mediazona.\n\n“The explosion, fire, and smoke killed 20 of the cruiser’s crew, 24 suffered injuries of varying severity, and eight were missing, including during the over six-hour battle for the ship’s survival,” the statement said, according to Mediazona, adding that the ship was “not involved” in Russia’s operation in Ukraine.\n\nAsked by CNN for a comment, Dmytro Pletenchuk, the spokesperson for Ukraine’s Naval Forces, said it was difficult for Russia to deny the facts of the sinking, especially since the families of the Moskva’s crew have been speaking out.\n\nThe backtracking on the statement by the court is just the latest propaganda fail by Russian authorities.\n\nIn the early days of the invasion, the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti published, and then quickly removed, an editorial prematurely celebrating Russia’s victory in the war. Nearly four years later, Russian forces continue to grind along the front lines achieving incremental territorial gains at an extremely high cost, while Ukraine has managed to retake vast areas that Moscow initially invaded.\n\nThe Russian military and the Kremlin have exercised an extremely tight control over the narrative around Russia’s war on Ukraine – even refusing to call the conflict a “war” and referring to it instead as Russia’s “special military operation.”\n\nNumerous journalists who have reported on the facts of the ground, including documenting massacres committed by Russian soldiers in Bucha and elsewhere, have been jailed for spreading “false information” about the Russian army.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists said in December that at least 27 journalist had been imprisoned on criminal charges related to their reporting since Russia launched the full-scale invasion. The committee said that four have been released, two exiled and one killed. The rest are still in prison.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Olena Janchuk spends another day of freezing isolation in her high-rise apartment.\n\nThe former kindergarten teacher has severe rheumatoid arthritis, and has been trapped for weeks on the 19th floor of her Kyiv tower block, 650 steps from the ground.\n\nLong daily blackouts caused by Russia’s bombardment of power plants and transmission lines have made working elevators a luxury.\n\nWith January temperatures plummeting to minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit), there’s a permanent line of frost on the inside of Janchuk’s windows, white patterns creeping across the glass by morning.\n\nThe 53-year-old huddles over a makeshift fireplace of candles arranged beneath stacked bricks, designed to absorb and slowly release heat. USB charging cables snake across the floor from overloaded power strips, while her electric blanket is hooked up to a power bank rationed for the coldest hours.\n\n“When there’s no light and heat for seventeen and a half hours, you have to come up with something,” she said. “The bricks work best in a small room, so we stay in there.”\n\nKyiv, a city of about 3 million people, is dominated by tower blocks, many from the Soviet era, now left without power for most of the day.\n\nIn this fourth winter of war, electricity is a rationed commodity.\n\nResidents plan their lives around electricity schedules: when to cook, shower, charge phones and run washing machines. Food is chosen for shelf life, water filtered into bottles and stored in buckets. Small camping gas burners are used to heat soup or tea when the power is out.\n\nSleep is fractured by air raid sirens and the need to use electricity during off-peak hours.\n\nOutside, across snow-covered Kyiv, diesel generators rumble on commercial streets. Shoppers navigate aisles using phone flashlights, and bars glow by candlelight.\n\nApps notify users of narrowing electricity windows — usually just a few hours — enough for a household reboot.\n\nLife gets harder on the higher floors\n\nJanchuk’s 22-story building is located near a power station and residents can see the missile and drone attacks firsthand, flashes lighting up the horizon at night.\n\nDuring blackouts, they climb the stairs in darkness, phone lights bouncing off concrete steps, often accompanied by the echo of children and barking dogs. People sometimes leave plastic bags with cookies or water inside elevators for those who get stuck when the power cuts midride.\n\nJanchuk’s husband, out working most of the day, brings the groceries in the evening while her mother, 72-year-old Lyudmila Bachurina, is in charge of chores.\n\n“It’s cold, but we manage,” the mother says, holding a square USB-charged flashlight she recently mounted on the wall. “When the lights come on, I start turning on the washing machine, fill up water bottles, cook food, charge power banks, run around the kitchen and run around the house.”\n\nIn upscale neighborhoods, residents pool funds for generators to keep elevators running. But most blocks — home to pensioners, families and people with disabilities — cannot afford them.\n\nDisability advocates, including groups representing wounded war veterans, say staircases have become an invisible social barrier, cutting people off inside their own homes.\n\nThey are urging city officials to fund generators for residential buildings.\n\nUntil then, life bends around the electricity timetable. USB lamps, power banks and inverter batteries have become household staples. Telegram chats help neighbors check on the elderly and swap blackout updates.\n\nFrom upper floors, Kyivans look out over a skyline of high rises and the city’s historic golden-domed churches. At night, flashes of explosions are visible as Russia continues its campaign against Ukraine’s energy system.\n\nRussia has inflicted vast damage on Ukraine’s infrastructure\n\nToo many power stations and transmission lines have been hit to meet demand, even with electricity imports from Europe. To prevent a grid collapse, operators impose rolling blackouts, keeping hospitals and critical services alive while homes go dark.\n\nAt one coal-fired power plant struck repeatedly, shift supervisor Yuriy walks through wreckage of charred machinery, collapsed roofs and control panels melted into useless lumps. Repairs are carried out by torchlight, giant sandbags shielding what still works. Photographs of colleagues killed on the job hang near the entrance.\n\n“After missile and drone attacks, the consequences are terrible — large-scale,” he said.\n\nOfficials asked that the plant’s location and Yuriy’s full name not be disclosed for security reasons.\n\n“Our energy equipment has been destroyed. It is expensive,” Yuriy said. “Right now, we’re restoring what we can.”\n\nUkraine’s energy sector has suffered more than $20 billion in direct war damage, according to a joint estimate by the World Bank, the European Commission and the United Nations.\n\nKyiv has repeatedly updated its austere winter power-saving schedule, dimming or cutting streetlights in low-traffic areas and investing in less centralized power generation.\n\nIn the tower blocks, restoration feels far off.\n\n“I’m tired, really tired, to be honest. When you can’t go outside, when you don’t see the sun, when there’s no light and you can’t even go to the store on your own. … It wears you down,” Bachurina said.\n\n“But the important thing, as all Ukrainians say now, is that we will endure anything until the war ends.”\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "Jan 24 (Reuters) - Russia launched another vast attack on Ukraine's energy system in the small hours of Saturday, rocking Kyiv with explosions throughout the night and leaving ​1.2 million properties without power countrywide.\n\nNearly 6,000 buildings in the capital were left without heating ‌on Saturday morning as temperatures hovered around -10 degrees Celsius (14 F). Many residents' apartments were already freezing cold from disruption to the ‌city's centralised heat distribution system following previous attacks.\n\nMoscow carried out the strikes as trilateral, U.S.-brokered talks between Russia and Ukraine continued into a second day in the UAE, with no sign of compromise on Friday.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said one person was killed in the capital city and four injured, including three being treated ⁠in hospital, while 19 people including ‌a child were wounded in Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv.\n\nRussia, which has pummelled Ukraine's power grid since its full-scale invasion in 2022, is conducting its heaviest bombardment campaign ‍on energy facilities this winter, leaving people across Ukraine with only a few hours of power a day and some without heat or water.\n\nOver 800,000 people in the capital and another 400,000 in the northern region of Chernihiv ​were without power after the latest attacks, Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said.\n\nUkraine's air force said ‌Russia had unleashed 375 drones and 21 missiles, including two of its rarely deployed Tsirkon ballistic missiles, in its overnight attack.\n\nThe sky over Kyiv was lit up by regular orange flashes as air defences fired on missiles and drones descending on the capital, with loud booms echoing around the city's tall buildings.\n\nTymur Tkachenko, head of Kyiv's military administration, reported strikes in at least four districts. A medical facility was ⁠among the buildings damaged.\n\nBefore Saturday, Kyiv had already endured two ​mass overnight attacks since the New Year that have knocked ​out power and heating to hundreds of residential buildings.\n\nEmergency workers were still engaged in restoring services to residents that had been knocked out by those attacks, and Klitschko said ‍many of the buildings ⁠that had lost heating on Saturday had only recently had it restored.\n\nIn Kharkiv, a frequent target 30 km (18 miles) from the Russian border and much closer to eastern battlefronts, Mayor Ihor ⁠Terekhov said 25 drones had hit several districts.\n\nWriting on Telegram, Terekhov said the drones had struck a dormitory for displaced people ‌and two medical facilities including a maternity hospital.",

    "description": "Military competition between the US and rivals Russia and China in the Arctic is exposing weaknesses in the US arsenal.",
    "fullText": "For war across the freezing Arctic battlefields, the US faces a problem: it doesn't have the right weapons or tools to reliably detect threats in the region and respond to them quickly.\n\nThe Arctic is an unforgiving place for a war. It's a location where distances are vast, subzero temperatures can cripple equipment, and forces must operate with limited support infrastructure, but as competition with US rivals and adversaries becomes fiercer, there is a growing realization that a future fight could unfold across an Arctic battlespace. Among experts and officials, there's also increasing concern about US readiness.\n\nIf US forces in the region can't spot threats early, position assets effectively, and sustain troops in harsh conditions, the region could become a corridor for undetected attacks.\n\nGaps in Arctic defenses have been one element of President Donald Trump's erratic rhetoric on US interests in the acquisition of Greenland. He has said it is necessary for the substantial US missile defense project known as Golden Dome.\n\n\"If there is a war, much of the action will take place on that piece of ice,\" Trump said on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"Think of it: those missiles would be flying right over the center.\"\n\nThe president isn't the first to call attention to the strategic and national security implications surrounding the Arctic. Warnings have come from across administrations.\n\nLeaders in Washington have expressed similar concerns about the importance of the Arctic region for homeland defense in recent years. In its 2024 Arctic strategy doctrine, the US Department of Defense emphasized the need for better, more modernized all-domain awareness, surveillance and sensors, naval capabilities, and missile warning technologies. Existing systems, the department said, weren't sufficient for the growing threats in the region.\n\nSpecifically, the US, along with some of its NATO allies, has underinvested in capabilities needed to detect, track, and respond to activity across vast Arctic distances.\n\nSome necessary capabilities include aerial and underwater surveillance, as well as defense and naval warfare capabilities like anti-submarine frigates, heavy icebreakers, polar-capable multi-mission surface vessels, and dual-use sealift capacity, Liselotte Odgaard, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, wrote in a new report. Infrastructure such as undersea sensor networks, command and control systems, ports, runways, and roads is also lacking.\n\n\"As a result, the US and its allies have insufficient monitoring, response, and sustainment options,\" she explained. \"These shortfalls allow adversaries to transit waters and territories undetected, sustain forces in combat theaters for prolonged periods, and successfully challenge allied forces in combat-like situations.\"\n\nUS presence, whether through domain awareness or more constant exercises in the region, has also been lacking, leaving the Arctic as the \"shortest and least defended threat sector,\" former deputy commander of US Northern Command, Army Gen. Thomas Carden, said in 2024.\n\nWith recognition of the challenges has come new efforts. Recent moves, like the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Coast Guard’s fiscal year 2026 budget, have included millions of dollars for new icebreakers, Coast Guard cutters, and needed Arctic infrastructure upgrades. The Coast Guard’s newly renamed Arctic District has taken on a more prominent monitoring role, and last year, the service received its first polar icebreaker in over 25 years.\n\nAdditionally, the US is working to field new air defense systems and interceptors to replace or supplement the ones in Alaska. And the Space Force's 2026 budget includes billions for Golden Dome, specifically space-based sensors and interceptors, and modernization efforts at Pituffik Space Base in Greenland.\n\nBut key areas remain underdeveloped.\n\nAs Odgaard wrote in her new report, parts of the airspace over eastern Greenland and the North Pole are not consistently surveilled, and the submarine detection and tracking capabilities along Greenland's eastern coast fall short of what is needed.\n\nThose gaps are concerning as Russia focuses on expanding submarine operations in the Arctic.\n\nUncrewed systems, both naval and aerial drones, could, in theory, extend surveillance coverage across vast areas that are expensive and difficult to patrol without increasing the demand on traditional crewed aircraft and assets.\n\nThe harsh Arctic environment could challenge such efforts. With drones, it could stress their batteries, range, connections, and performance. Recent exercises have shown troops that temperatures below freezing, low visibility, snowy or icy conditions, and strong winds can degrade aerial drones and other equipment.\n\nThe US' renewed investments in preparation for Arctic warfare come as Russia and China are deepening cooperation and more actively pursuing interests in the region. Russia has been looking to expand where its submarines can operate as China positions itself strategically as a \"near Arctic\" nation, joining Russia on joint patrols, including ones near Alaska. China is also investing in naval capabilities, ships, and drones for the region.",

    "fullText": "While the US military has pursued ambitious technological advances, manpower remains one of its core pillars.\n\nFrom high-ranking generals to soldiers on the field, human troops remain a key way to assess the reach and power of the world's militaries.\n\nUsing data from the International Institute for Strategic Studies' 2025 Military Balance report, Business Insider ranked countries by the size of their active armed forces and listed their defense budgets, based on 2024 figures.\n\nActive-duty force size is a tally of a country's uniformed troops: airmen, soldiers, sailors, special operators, and Marines. Armies, in particular, depend on size to gain and occupy ground. Militaries can also be a tool of domestic repression, a focus that undercuts its capabilities against an external foe. North Korea, for example, is one of the world's most repressive states, led by a dictator who has repeatedly threatened neighboring South Korea.\n\nThe number of active-duty military personnel is far from the only factor that matters when comparing military power between countries, but it shows latent power that could be augmented via conscription and calling up reservists.\n\n\"Numbers have value, but there's a lot more to military capability,\" said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, DC-based foreign policy and national security think tank.\n\nIISS, a London-headquartered think tank, counts active armed forces, reservists, and paramilitaries as separate categories in its analysis, showing a fuller picture of each nation's manpower.\n\nSome countries have significantly higher numbers of reservists than others — Vietnam has the largest number in the world, estimated at 5 million.\n\nBut while reservists can aid militaries when needed, the quality and longevity of their expertise can vary between conscription- and volunteer-based systems, Cancian told Business Insider.\n\n\"When you look at some countries' reserve numbers, you're often looking at people who haven't trained in 10 or 20 years,\" he said. \"It gives you a big number, but their military value is questionable.\"\n\nAnd while paramilitaries can be effective at enforcing internal security and party strength, Cancian says that \"as a military force, they have essentially zero value.\"\n\nEven when accounting for all of a military's manpower, personnel is only one of the various factors that can qualify a nation's military strength, which also include equipment and readiness.\n\nThere's also the role of technologies in global warfare, the size and sophistication of air forces and naval fleets, amphibious capabilities to land assault forces, command and control systems, or nuclear forces, which all shape military power. Larger and more advanced forces require higher state expenditures.\n\nStill, comparing global manpower offers insight into how countries prioritize military power.\n\nSee how the world's largest militaries stack up.",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Thursday that Russia is building roughly 500 Iranian-designed drones a day.\n\nHis comments at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, are a rare public assessment from Ukrainian leaders about Russia's drone-making capacity and provide some insight into how Kyiv sees the balance of power in its long-range drone fight.\n\nZelenskyy has said repeatedly that Ukraine is building 1,000 interceptor drones — small quadcopters designed to counter other flying drones — every day.\n\n\"We produce them at about 1,000 a day. We really produce them, but it's not enough. It's still not enough,\" he told his audience in Davos. \"Russia has 500, about 500 drones, Iranian drones, each day, and dozens of missiles, ballistic missiles.\"\n\nIranian drones refer to Russia's Geran family of loitering munitions, which are mostly based on the Iranian Shahed, a delta-wing drone designed to carry explosive warheads at long range. Because their designs are so closely related, Ukrainians often use their names interchangeably.\n\nThese drones have been a major pain point for Ukraine, which is frequently bombarded by hundreds of Gerans and decoy drones at a time from across Russia's border.\n\nLast week, Ukraine's commander in chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said that Russia is likely aiming to scale up its drone-making capacity to 1,000 Gerans per day.\n\nHe added that Russia is already building 404 Shaheds of \"various types\" per day.\n\nZelenskyy's latest comment also provides clues about the battlefield conditions for Ukraine's new type of air defense with interceptor drones.\n\nThe Ukrainian president's figures imply that his country is fielding twice as many interceptors as Russia's Shaheds, but that a 2:1 ratio isn't sufficient to protect his country's skies.\n\nFor now, interceptor drones in Ukraine are mostly controlled by human pilots, who have the difficult task of maneuvering lightweight quadcopters — sometimes in strong winds or poor weather — to chase down a flying target at speeds of over 100 mph in the vast sky.\n\nEarlier this week, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine also risks running short of interceptor drone pilots and told his government to prioritize recruiting and training more of them.\n\nThe Kremlin has been increasingly developing versions of Gerans with new features, such as jet engines to replace propellers or additional cameras to help the drone avoid interceptors.\n\nMore recently, Ukraine said Russia has deployed a new type of turbojet Geran that mirrors Iran's Karrar attack drone. Unlike the Shahed, it features a more conventional aircraft design,",

He suggested progress towards a deal to end a dispute over the semi-autonomous Danish territory that risked ⁠the deepest rupture in transatlantic relations ‌in decades.\n\nPutin, addressing the matter for the first time in public, signalled that Russia would not object to Trump's push to control Greenland, which he speculated ‍may be worth nearly $1 billion.\n\n\"What happens in Greenland is of no concern to us whatsoever,\" Putin told a meeting of Russia's Security Council.\n\n\"Incidentally, Denmark has always treated Greenland as a colony and has been quite harsh, if not ​cruel, towards it. But that is a different matter altogether, and hardly anyone is interested ‌in it now,\" Putin added.\n\nDenmark's financial and military support for Ukraine has angered Russia, which is fighting to take full control of four Ukrainian regions it claimed as its own in 2022.\n\nRussia's foreign ministry has bridled at Trump's suggestion that Moscow has ambitions on Greenland too, but has been careful not to criticise Trump - who is trying to broker a deal to end the ⁠war in Ukraine - and has hinted it has some sympathy ​for his claim.\n\nForeign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday that ​the giant resource-rich island, which already has a U.S. military presence, was not \"a natural part\" of Denmark.\n\nPutin recalled that Russia in 1867 sold Alaska to the United ‍States for $7.2 million, and that ⁠Denmark in 1917 sold the Virgin Islands to Washington, setting precedents for such land transactions.\n\nUsing the Alaska price - adjusted for inflation and accounting for the larger size of Greenland and ⁠changes in gold prices, Putin said buying Greenland from Denmark could cost around $1 billion, which he said he thought Washington ‌could afford.\n\n\"I think they will sort it out between themselves,\" said Putin.",

The French navy is escorting the ship to anchorage for more checks, the statement said. The tanker departed from the city of Murmansk in northwestern Russia, it said.\n\nOil revenue is a key part of Russia’s economy, allowing President Vladimir Putin to pour money into the war effort against Ukraine without worsening inflation for everyday people and avoiding a currency collapse.\n\nFrance and other countries have vowed to crack down on the sanction-busting shadow fleet of oil tankers which experts estimate numbers over 400 ships. They are also trying to secure deals with flag-carrying countries to make it easier to board the vessels.\n\nRussia is using what is described as a “shadow fleet” to evade sanctions over its war on Ukraine. The fleet is a compilation of aging vessels and tankers owned by nontransparent entities with addresses in non-sanctioning countries, and sailing under flags from such countries.\n\n“We are determined to uphold international law and to ensure the effective enforcement of sanctions,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said in a post about the interception, with a photo showing a French helicopter hovering over a ship.\n\n“The activities of the ‘shadow fleet’ contribute to financing the war of aggression against Ukraine,” Macron added.\n\nThe French mission was conducted together with the U.K, which gathered and shared intelligence that enabled the ship to be intercepted, according to French military officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the operation.\n\nThe ship was operating under a false flag from the Comoros islands, which are off east Africa, and its crew is Indian, the officials said. It was intercepted in the western Mediterranean, off the southern Spanish coastal town of Almeria, the officials said.\n\nLast September, French naval forces boarded another oil tanker off the French Atlantic coas t that Macron also linked to the shadow fleet. That tanker traveled from the Russian oil terminal in Primorsk near Saint Petersburg. Known as “Pushpa” or “Boracay\" — its name was changed several times — the ship was sailing under the flag of Benin.\n\nPutin denounced that interception as an act of piracy and alleged that Macron initiated the move to deflect attention from French domestic problems.\n\nThe tanker's captain will go on trial in February over the crew’s alleged refusal to cooperate, according to French judicial authorities.",

Oleksandr Syrskyi, said in December that his forces had, for the first time, killed and wounded more Russian soldiers in one month than the Kremlin had called up for the same time period.\n\nFedorov, who was confirmed in his role last week, said on Tuesday that Ukrainian troops are already documenting 35,000 kills every month via video.\n\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte cited another figure while speaking in Brussels on January 16, saying that 20,000 to 25,000 Russian troops were dying every month.\n\nWhile differing significantly, both figures indicate that Russia is fighting the war at a high cost.\n\nRutte said the death rate has become \"unsustainable\" for Russia, and drew comparisons to the Soviet Union's losses during the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan, when an estimated 15,000 Soviet troops died every month over nine years.\n\nLikewise, Fedorov expressed hopes that ramping up a focus on lethality will exhaust Russia's war machine.\n\n\"If we reach the figure of 50,000, we will see what happens to the enemy. They treat people as a resource, and problems with that resource are already obvious,\" he said.\n\nRussia does not disclose how many of its troops are wounded or killed during the war. However, international and Ukrainian analyses say the number is likely tracking past 1 million people over nearly four years of war.\n\nThe UK's defense ministry said in early January that the Kremlin may have suffered at least 1.2 million total casualties, which includes both wounded and deceased, since February 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kremlin has relied largely on hefty sign-up bonuses to attract local contract soldiers, though it's also been found to sustain troop levels through other means, such as by recruiting from prisons or hiring foreigners via informal channels.\n\nSome of those strategies may be waning. On Tuesday, the Russian independent media outlet Vertska reported that contract soldier sign-ups were slowing in some areas of the country.\n\nData from an unnamed source in the Moscow mayor's office, it wrote, showed that the capital had seen a roughly 25% annual drop in recruitment in 2025.\n\nIt's unclear how Fedorov intends to specifically target increasing combat kills. He said in his opening remarks to Ukrainian lawmakers last week that he intended to divert more staffing to drone units. Drones are thought to be responsible for roughly 70 to 90% of casualties inflicted during the war.\n\nHis new objective also comes against the backdrop of the US attempting to negotiate a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia. Many of the Kremlin's latest war actions, such as attempts to take Pokrovsk, have been seen in Ukraine as efforts to posture into a position of strength.\n\nAt 32, Fedorov is Ukraine's youngest-ever defense minister. He's begun his new appointment with promises of aggressive reform of the military's structure and how it distributes resources to its fighters.\n\nFedorov was previously Ukraine's minister for digital transformation.",

    "fullText": "As the Ukraine-Russia drone arms race rages, hobbyists far from the war are pushing the limit for how quickly these small quadcopters can fly.\n\nA father-son duo in South Africa set a new Guinness World Record by reaching a ground speed of 408 mph with their custom, battery-powered remote-controlled quadcopter, the Peregreen V4.\n\nLuke and Mike Bell performed the record-breaking flight on December 11, 2025, the Guinness World Records organization said in a statement in January.\n\nWhile drones built for war are constrained by additional factors, the Bells' achievement expands the possibilities of how these devices might one day perform on the battlefield.\n\nIt also lays bare how accessible new war-relevant technology is becoming for civilians. The Bells documented their design and build process on YouTube, filming themselves using a 3D printer and off-the-shelf parts to create the Peregreen V4.\n\nTheir drone's design features a dome-shaped head and four propellers extending from the lower body — much like many of the interceptor drones available on the Ukrainian market today.\n\nThese drones, developed primarily as a low-cost way of countering Russian Shahed-type loitering munitions, have become a pillar of Ukrainian air defense.\n\nSome of the fastest interceptors available to Ukrainian forces can reach 200 mph, which is also the typical velocity of a bullet train.\n\nUkrainians are trying to push their quadcopters to fly even faster. Flight speed is key for these interceptors because they're designed to chase and crash into Shaheds, and Russia has been continually ramping up the speeds of its attack drones.\n\nThe Geran-2, a Shahed-type drone that Russia launches more commonly, can carry an explosive warhead for hundreds of miles at top speeds of 115 mph. Newer, jet-powered versions of Shaheds are estimated to fly up to 230 mph in some conditions.\n\nA major issue with faster drones is that their components tend to overheat when pushed to the limit — whether it's the propeller motors, wiring, or batteries.\n\nIn their YouTube videos, the Bells repeatedly recorded their drone or its individual parts catching fire during tests.\n\nDrone makers also have to juggle other design factors, such as the drone's aerodynamics and propeller efficiency.\n\nUkrainian war manufacturers face additional constraints: Their drones need to carry an additional payload — often 200 grams to 1 kg of explosives. They must also be maneuverable enough to pivot and catch a flying enemy target, and be mass-produced.\n\nEarlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country was already producing 1,000 interceptor drones a day.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bells' flight record involved a single drone that flew largely in a straight line.\n\nThe duo's latest certification is the third time they've attained the fastest-drone record. The previous holder of the achievement was Australian drone maker Ben Biggs, who built a drone that reached 389 mph late last year.\n\nBefore Biggs' record, the Bells' earlier quadcopter, the Peregreen V3, had flown at up to roughly 363 mph in the summer of 2025.\n\nIn 2024, the pair set a record of 298 mph with a similar drone design.\n\nGuinness World Records requires aspiring drone record-breakers to fly their device in two opposing directions and then calculate the average speed to account for wind.",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces fired nearly $100 million worth of air defense missiles battling Russia's latest bombardment, Kyiv revealed on Tuesday, offering insight into the war's growing financial toll.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters that the Russian attack, which began Monday night and continued into Tuesday, forced Kyiv to launch around €80 million (roughly $94 million) worth of interceptor missiles.\n\n\"Imagine that — the cost of these missiles,\" Zelenskyy said over WhatsApp in response to a question about interceptor stockpiles.\n\nThe staggering figure covers only the interceptor missiles and does not appear to account for any other munitions expended to defend against the Russian attack, which also included hundreds of drones.\n\nRussia launched 18 ballistic missiles, 15 cruise missiles, and one anti-ship missile overnight, according to data from Ukraine's air force. It said in a statement that 27 were shot down, while five hit their targets.\n\nZelenskyy said Russia has \"significantly increased\" its use of ballistic missiles and has been able to obtain critical technology for the munitions from third-party countries and from industry.\n\n\"Nevertheless, their ability to produce these missiles must be reduced — and that is not happening yet,\" he said in response to another question.\n\nAlthough Ukraine has received some additional air defense systems from Western countries, Zelenskyy said more are still needed, along with additional interceptor missiles to keep pace with Russia's attacks.\n\nZelenskyy acknowledged that it has been difficult for Ukraine to obtain the necessary interceptor missiles. He specifically singled out the PAC-3, which has a $3.7 million price tag and is fired from US-made Patriot batteries, as the best chance Kyiv has to defeat Russian ballistic missiles.\n\n\"War is an extremely expensive Russian luxury, and for us it results in severe losses,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nRussian missiles are not the only worry for Ukraine. Moscow's overnight attack involved 339 drones. Kyiv said its Air Force shot down 315 of them. Two dozen hit their targets.\n\nTo preserve its costly air defense missiles, Ukraine has been increasingly relying on locally made interceptor drones that cost as little as a few thousand dollars to hunt down and destroy Russian drones.\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine is producing around 1,000 interceptor drones each day, a goal he set last summer. The challenge now, he said, is that the number of drones has outpaced the number of operators who can control them.\n\n\"Therefore, now we must catch up in terms of the number of interceptor groups — the corresponding mobile groups,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that he has tasked senior Ukrainian military leadership with bridging the gap.",

    "fullText": "For most of us in the West, until the fall of the Berlin Wall “Russia” was synonymous with the Soviet Union. Among the 15 constituent states of the Communist empire, Russia was always the pre-eminent one. It housed the USSR’s capital, Moscow, and its other major city, Leningrad (now St Petersburg); it accounted for the lion’s share of the union’s economic and industrial output.\n\nIt did not, however, inevitably supply the leading Soviet figures. Stalin was Georgian. Khrushchev’s family came from, and he spent much of his formative years in what is now Ukraine. Brezhnev’s passport stated his ethnicity as “Ukrainian”. Although Andropov, Chernenko and Gorbachev were all Russians, they were from such distant and provincial parts of the empire – Chernenko from Siberia, the other two from Stavropol on the verge of the Caucasus – that they, and other Politburo figures of similar backgrounds, are classed by the historian Mark B Smith as “outsiders”. Exit Stalin, Smith’s superb new book, is partly about how Sovietism ended badly, in different ways, for most of them.\n\nStalin, with whose death Smith begins, had become a cult figure of fear and – although it remained well concealed until Khrushchev’s epoch-defining “secret speech” of 1956 – loathing. Khrushchev himself would be deposed by his colleagues in 1964, but was at least allowed to die in his bed seven years later, and not hustled off to the gulag. Brezhnev’s form of repression was milder, at least at home – the Czechs in 1968 would have taken a less charitable view – but he was gaga long before his death in 1982. His own successors, Andropov and Chernenko, assumed power as sick geriatrics and managed just over two years in office between them. Gorbachev, just 54 when he took over, managed to bury the Soviet project.\n\nLooking back on Gorbachev’s six-year rule, it now seems like a golden age, before the USSR collapsed and the drunken buffoon Yeltsin became the first president of Russia. The latter would pave the way for a return to tyranny under Putin. This is a tragic story, and Smith tells it magnificently.\n\nYet Exit Stalin is not merely a political history of a country that struggled for decades before eventually gaining its place as one of the world’s two superpowers. As the book’s subtitle says, it is a study of the Soviet Union “as a civilisation”. Smith focuses on cultural and social history, ensuring we grasp the dismal conditions in which people existed, and the climate of fear in which, even after 1956 and liberation from the ghost of Stalin, they had to live.\n\nLarge families, for example, were piled into jerry-built apartment buildings. Sometimes they had to cram themselves into a couple of rooms, or even share with other families. Smith writes of a Soviet actress who, growing up in the 1950s and 1960s, shared a block and a single bathroom with 43 other people. Dissidents were confined to psychiatric hospitals for no reason other than that they had the temerity to go out and protest. Some, such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, were sent to the gulag.\n\nOnly in the Brezhnev era would things improve: Andrey Sakharov and his wife, Elena Bonner, were granted internal exile in a provincial apartment. Exit Stalin never leaves us under any impression other than that life in the Soviet Union, whether by absolute or comparative standards, was horrible, and presents Stalin, in particular, as someone who, for the crimes of his rule and for the shadow cast for decades after his death, richly deserves to be equated with Hitler.\n\nEverything had to be justified as consistent with the revolution, though no one was precisely sure what the revolution meant. Stalin’s death, and the expunging of his legacy by Khrushchev, at least allowed a relative relaxation of the gulag’s horrors – the carting off to exile or execution of endless ranks of political prisoners – and the acceptance of certain degrees of modernisation.\n\nThe most remarkable advance – and such was its remoralising effect on Soviet society that Smith correctly gives it great emphasis – was Yuri Gagarin’s becoming the first man in space in 1961. It was an event that put this otherwise still primitive, brutal, deprived, vicious country at the cutting edge of futurism.\n\nThat the Soviets did not also put the first man on the Moon is indicative of how the nature of their society prevented the speedy and effective evolution of technology. Their education system produced a striking number of advanced mathematicians, but the contribution the latter could make to the future was itself suppressed to an extent, not least because the authorities worried that so many of these geniuses were Jewish.\n\nBrezhnev, ruling from 1964 to 1982, had the wit to start worrying about international opinion of the Soviet Union, and the era of détente saw the Helsinki accords, progress towards arms limitation, and the linking up in space of US astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts. But genuine reform was too slow to come. Beyond the Soviet borders, the world was changing rapidly, and inside them, more Soviet citizens were coming to resent what they knew not merely to be the liberties but also the higher living standards of the despised capitalist economies.\n\nChange became inevitable, and the generational shift to Gorbachev accelerated it. He studied Lenin and other revolutionary texts, but gave up attempting to relate them mechanically to the world. When the security forces for which he was responsible applied traditional methods of brutality to the state’s opponents, Gorbachev condemned the heavy-handedness. His economic advisers told him to move towards a market economy. This was not merely a case of the Soviet people wanting more freedom: there were food shortages and technological failures, notably in April 1986 at the Chernobyl nuclear plant. Lives were endangered by the government’s slowness in admitting the disaster, in keeping with the traditional Soviet way of covering up unpleasant truths. The old model was evidently broken.\n\nSmith’s description of the chaotic and rapid decline of those last years is careful and vivid. Whether it was his intention or not, Gorbachev emerges as a figure of genuine greatness. How deeply depressing that his legacy has been squandered in the way it has. This immensely important book charts a history of idealism that failed because of its inherent lack of liberty, its repressiveness and its corruption. Now, it seems, in Russia at least, history is in the process of repeating itself.\n\nExit Stalin: The Soviet Union as a Civilization, 1953–1991 is published by Allen Lane at £40.

We are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to other countries.”\n\nHe added, “In Trump 1.0, President Trump told the Europeans, ‘Do not build Nord Stream 2.

So America has to be in control there.”\n\nPolitics: CNN Panelist Goes Nuclear On Scott Jennings In Viral Post: ‘I’m Probably About To Be Banned’\n\nTrump has repeatedly floated the idea of annexing Greenland and hasnot ruled out using military force to obtain it despite pushback from European leaders.\n\nWelker pressed Bessent over how serious Trump is about Greenland and whether his actions have been a part of a “negotiating tactic.”\n\n“President Trump strongly believes that we cannot outsource our security,” he replied, before adding that “down the road, this fight for the Arctic is real.”\n\n“We would keep our NATO guarantees. And if there were an attack on Greenland from Russia, from some other area, we would get dragged in,” he said. “So better now, peace through strength, make it part of the United States, and there will not be a conflict because the United States right now, we are the hottest country in the world.”\n\n“We are the strongest country in the world. Europeans project weakness. U.S. projects strength.”\n\nWelker didn’t let up, urging Bessent to confirm whether Trump has been using a “negotiating tactic.”\n\n“Is the goal to get a deal to have enhanced security in Greenland, for example?” she asked.\n\nPolitics: Donald Trump Tries To Sweet-Talk Territory Takeover Bid\n\n“The president believes that enhanced security is not possible without Greenland being part of the U.S.,” he replied.\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Welker questioned the White House official over why it’s “necessary [for the U.S.] to take over and annex all of Greenland” despite the fact that “85% of people living in Greenland oppose” the potential move.\n\n“The United States has a base in Greenland. I’ve been talking to lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Denmark has given the United States a green light to beef up its security as much as is needed in Greenland. Why not take that route?” she asked Bessent.\n\n“Well, again let’s look back. Denmark has a terrible history with Greenlanders,” he responded. “There were forced sterilizations up until the ’80s or the ’90s. So all of a sudden, now that the U.S. has expressed an interest, there is, you know, this new interest.”\n\nPolitics: Kristi Noem: Don't Say ICE Agent Jonathan Ross' Name\n\nClaiming that the “United States needs to be in control to prevent a war,” Bessent added, “And we do not want to get dragged into someone else’s war.”\n\nWelker later brought up that “senior Democrats say there are no pressing threats on Greenland’s security from Russia or China,” before asking Bessent what “evidence” the Trump administration has that there is a “pressing threat.”\n\nShe also noted “the Danish foreign minister says there hasn’t been a Chinese warship in Greenland for a decade.”\n\n“Well, first of all, Kristen, we have asymmetric information. And again, President Trump is being strategic here. What evidence was there that the Russians were going into Crimea? Well, actually there was a lot of evidence that the Russians were going to go into Ukraine,” he responded.\n\nPolitics: Wall Street Journal Flags A Dark Downside To Donald Trump’s Greenland Push\n\nBessent pivoted to placing the blame on the Biden administration. “And Joe Biden said, ‘Well, just take a little bit of it.’ But what we know is that Greenland can only be defended if it is part of the U.S.”\n\n“And it will not need to be defended if it is part of the U.S. The president is trying to avoid a conflict,” he added.\n\nWrapping up their discussion on Greenland, Welker asked: “If the United States were to take Greenland by force, how would that be different than Russia’s annexation of Crimea?”\n\n“Look, I believe that Europeans will understand that this is best for Greenland, best for Europe, and best for the United States,” he responded.\n\nWatch Bessent’s “Meet the Press” interview below.\n\nWhite House Deputy Press Secretary Called Out For Falsifying Michael Jackson, Diana Ross Photos In Epstein Files\n\nAnother High-Ranking Republican Can't Help But Praise Mamdani\n\nBessent Says U.S. Food Aid Benefits 'Could' Flow By Wednesday",

    "fullText": "Norway has issued thousands of letters to citizens warning that the army may have to seize their homes and vehicles if war breaks out with Russia.\n\nNorwegian military officials said the letters were an advance warning to those with assets that may need to be requisitioned.\n\nThe requisition policy covers vehicles, boats, machinery and property, and around 13,500 “preparatory requisitions” were issued on Monday, valid for one year.\n\n“The requisitions are intended to ensure that, in a wartime situation, the armed forces have access to the resources necessary for the defence of the country,” the Norwegian military said.\n\nThe letters will not have come as a shock to most recipients, as two thirds of them were simply renewing requisition notices from previous years.\n\nAnders Jernberg, the head of the military’s logistics organisation, said: “The importance of being prepared for crisis and war has increased dramatically in recent years.”\n\n“Norway is in the most serious security policy situation since the Second World War. Our society must be prepared for security policy crises and, in the worst case, war... we are undertaking a major build-up of military and civil preparedness,” he added.\n\nNorway plays a key role in Nato surveillance of the Arctic region, where the melting of the ice caps has created a scramble to secure new shipping routes and lucrative raw materials.\n\nThe Scandinavian country shares a maritime border – as well as a 123 mile-long land border – with Russia in the far northern Arctic region.\n\nRussia and China are seeking to expand their presence in the Arctic region, with the former building up old Soviet bases in the region and expanding its nuclear weapons stockpile on the Kola peninsula.\n\nThe requisition notices were issued amid an ongoing diplomatic crisis between the United States and Europe over president Donald Trump’s plans to annex Greenland, the minerals-rich Arctic island.\n\nMr Trump has cited Arctic security concerns as his main argument for annexing Greenland, an autonomous Danish overseas territory that is part of the Nato alliance.\n\nHe has threatened military action to take over the island, a step that would probably destroy the Western alliance even as it faces the growing risk of war with Russia.\n\nOn Monday, it emerged that Mr Trump also wants to take over Greenland because he is upset with Norway for refusing to give him a Nobel peace prize last year.\n\nDenmark and Greenland say the island is not for sale. They have the full support of Britain and the European Union.\n\nBut Sir Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister, said on Monday that he does not believe the United States is planning a military takeover of the island.\n\n“I don’t, actually. I think that this can be resolved and should be resolved through calm discussion, but with the application of the principles and values that I’ve set out in terms of who decides the future of Greenland, and making clear that the use of tariffs in this way is completely wrong,” he said.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Telegraph, Norway’s defence minister warned that Russia had recently launched a major expansion of its military bases in the Arctic region.\n\n“Russia is building up on the Kola peninsula ... where one of the largest arsenals of nuclear warheads in the world is located. They [the nuclear weapons] are not only pointed towards Norway, but towards the UK and over the pole towards Canada and the US,” Tore O. Sandvik told the Telegraph.\n\nMoscow is also trying to gain full control over the Arctic region in order to block Nato access to key shipping routes, he said.\n\n“We are the eyes and ears of Nato in this area, and we see that they’re testing new weapons, for example, hypersonic missiles, and they are testing nuclear-driven torpedoes and nuclear warheads,” he said.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "Ukraine is using ground robots and flying drones to take on Russia. One robot maker was surprised when soldiers combined them to be more effective.",
    "fullText": "A Ukrainian ground robot maker said soldiers surprised it with the ways they used its robots, including using flying drones to drop them closer to Russian positions.\n\nUkraine has a growing army of ground robots that can evacuate the injured, blow up inside or fire on Russian positions, lay or remove mines, carry cargo, and gather intelligence. It's a battlefield technology sector where Ukraine is rapidly experimenting and Western militaries are paying close attention.\n\nArk Robotics is one of the companies supplying these systems, making a suite of autonomous robots used by more than 20 Ukrainian brigades.\n\nIts CEO, Achi, told Business Insider that Ukrainian soldiers have demonstrated \"some really crazy ideas I would never imagine in my life that you would do.\" He spoke using a pseudonym as a security precaution.\n\nOne example involved pairing a small Ark ground robot with a larger aerial drone, which carried the robot forward before \"dropping it out of the sky.\"\n\nHe said that when he first saw it, his immediate reaction was: \"What the fuck? Why?\" Then it quickly made sense.\n\n\"The goal is simple: get a tool on the ground fast without putting a person in harm's way.\"\n\nUltimately, he found, \"it works.\"\n\nHe said this use \"wasn't the robot's original design, but give smart, motivated people a tool, and they'll find new ways to use it — and squeeze more out of it.\"\n\nThe \"soldiers keep surprising us,\" Achi said. \"They are very creative.\"\n\nAerial drones are available in significant numbers and are able to cover great distances quickly. Using them to transport ground robots helps overcome some of the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the robots, which have notable advantages once deployed.\n\nSmall ground robots can do things that are sometimes more challenging for aerial drones. They can drive into Russian dugouts or other positions to gather intelligence or deliver explosives. They can also be more precise when firing mounted weapons, and they are easier to conceal near Russian positions than aerial drones, which are noisy and have to hover overhead.\n\nAchi described the tactic as one example of how quickly battlefield technology and tactics are evolving in Ukraine.\n\n\"There is so much innovation happening right now that it's hard to comprehend,\" he said.\n\nOther arms makers have also been surprised at how Ukraine's forces have used their weaponry. Kuldar Väärsi, the founder and CEO of Estonia's Milrem Robotics, which makes ground robots used by Ukraine's forces, previously told BI that Ukrainian soldiers have used them in ways he hadn't expected.\n\n\"The creativity of Ukrainian troops is really admirable,\" he said, adding that the way the company's robots are used in Ukraine has led it to make changes in their design.\n\nCompanies with products deployed in Ukraine are seeking constant feedback from soldiers, often through group chats, video calls, and direct visits to front-line units.\n\nAchi said the challenge for Ark Robotics is keeping pace with new ideas without changing products so rapidly that large-scale production becomes impossible.\n\nArk needs to experiment constantly and stay aware of what's happening on the battlefield, but focusing on the wrong trends would mean sacrificing both mass and quality.\n\n\"This iteration cycle is insane. I've never seen anything like it,\" he said. It can mean making five different changes to a product in a few weeks, all while trying to make sure that you \"lead your whole engineering team the right way.\"\n\nAchi said that even the importance of ground robots surprised him. In 2023, they were a \"random side project,\" he said, but Ark has leaned into the technology.\n\nArk Robotics also develops aerial drones and is making a system called Frontier that it says will enable thousands of aerial drones and ground robots to work together effectively with minimal human involvement.\n\nUkraine's defense industry has boomed since Russia's full-scale invasion began in February 2022, and its Western partners have been closely watching, impressed at how quickly it can develop and make weaponry.\n\nGround robots still make up only a small fraction of Ukraine's drone usage, but it's a growing area, with more companies entering the space and existing ones growing.\n\nAchi said he believes Ukraine is moving toward a future in which robots handle a significant share of front-line logistics. His long-term view is that sending people into vehicles near the front lines will increasingly make little sense.",

    "description": "Oleksandr Syrskyi said that Russia is currently producing 404 Shaheds \"of various types\" per day.",
    "fullText": "Russia has plans to more than double production of its Iranian-designed attack drones to 1,000 per day, said Ukrainian Armed Forces' commander in chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi.\n\n\"The enemy plans to significantly increase production to use up to 1,000 drones per day,\" Syrskyi said of these drones.\n\nHe was speaking in an interview published on Sunday by the local media outlet LB.Ua, in which he commented on a wide range of topics, including the effectiveness of Ukraine's deep strikes into Russia and the balance of power in drone warfare.\n\nSyrskyi gave a precise assessment of Russia's current Shahed manufacturing, saying that Moscow can now produce 404 Shahed drones \"of various types\" every day.\n\nThese Russian delta-wing drones are closely modeled after Iran's loitering munitions. Moscow manufactures its own versions, dubbed Gerans, as well as cheaper decoys called Gerberas.\n\nRussia typically deploys a mix of strike drones and decoys when launching long-range attacks into Ukraine, and can send hundreds in a single night.\n\nSyrskyi did not say if Russia's daily Shahed production included Gerberas, nor did he break down exact production figures for each type of Shahed-type drone. The Geran-1 and Geran-2, propeller-driven drones that can fly up to 115 mph, are more common than the faster, jet-powered Geran-3.\n\nLaunching 1,000 Shahed-type drones a day would be a massive surge in Russia's attack capability. Moscow has generally been deploying 5,000 to 6,000 Shaheds a month against Ukraine, and half to four-fifths of these are usually strike variants.\n\nPer an analysis by the Institute for Science and International Security, Russia launched an average of 166 Shahed drones per day in December 2025. However, it's known to sometimes pause or reduce the intensity of its strikes to accumulate a stockpile for later use in a single large wave.\n\nCost is a major advantage for Shaheds. Each is estimated to cost between $20,000 and $70,000, making it cheaper and easier to manufacture than a conventional missile and providing Russia with a way to scale up its strike capability more sustainably.\n\nResource-strapped Ukraine has responded by seeking cheaper complements for its air defense network, including the growing use of small interceptor drones.\n\nStill, Russia's monthly use of Shahed-type drones has remained largely stagnant for the last six months. Moscow has, meanwhile, been experimenting with the loitering munitions, such as equipping them with air-to-air missiles or rear-facing cameras.\n\nSyrskyi's public assessment also comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned on Friday that his country was running low on ammunition for Western-supplied air defense systems.\n\nZelenskyy said that Ukraine had just secured a replenished stock of those munitions, but before that, it was fielding \"several systems without missiles.\"\n\n\"Today I can say this openly, because today, I have those missiles,\" he said.\n\nAs for other drones used in the war, Syrskyi said that Russia and Ukraine were now evenly matched in production quantity. Both Kyiv and Moscow have sporadically claimed the advantage on this front in recent years.\n\n\"The question is in quality. In conventional drones, quality is on our side. In fiber optics, unfortunately, we are only catching up with the enemy,\" Syrskyi said.",

    "fullText": "The next stop on Donald Trump’s world tour—or takeover—may be America’s northern neighbor.\n\nThe president, 79, has turned his attention toward Canada, fixating on what he sees as vulnerabilities along its northern border that could be exploited by U.S. adversaries Russia or China, two U.S. officials, a senior administration official, and three former senior U.S. officials told NBC News.\n\n“They certainly need to up their game when it comes to Arctic capabilities,” one official told the outlet, adding that Canada’s northern border “is not acceptable given today’s threats” and that “the status quo is not enough.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about what he views as Canada’s weak defenses, sparking conversations with Canadian officials about a broader Arctic security strategy, NBC reported. Among the initiatives that have caught Trump’s interest are expanded U.S. maritime patrols and the purchase of additional icebreakers—specialized ships designed to operate in ice-covered waters—operating in or around Canadian territory.\n\n“Trump is really worried about the U.S. continuing to drift in the Western Hemisphere and is focused on this,” one official told NBC.\n\nThey added: “At the end of the day, this is to stop Russia and China from having a further presence in the Arctic.”\n\nWith 3.85 million square miles and 40 million residents, Canada is the largest target on Trump’s growing list of potential land grabs.\n\nThe conversations come as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Friday, signaling an effort to deepen ties between the two countries. Carney became the first Canadian leader to visit China since 2017.\n\nTrump’s fixation on Canada, aides say, is part of a broader effort to “solidify” the Western Hemisphere—and falls in line with his aggressive campaign to acquire Greenland, the semiautonomous Danish territory.\n\n“Canada stands to benefit from the U.S. having Greenland,” one administration official said.\n\nCarney on Friday voiced support for Denmark’s NATO membership and said Greenland—home to roughly 57,000 residents and located northeast of Canada—should determine its own future.\n\nTrump’s increasingly frequent assertions that “We do need Greenland, absolutely,” for defense purposes, have rattled Denmark, whose leaders have repeatedly warned they will not give up the world’s largest island, and that an American takeover would end NATO.\n\nWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller asserted on Saturday that under “the law,” nations were not entitled to their territory if they were unable to defend it. The Trump aide belittled the Danish government, saying its “tiny” military was failing to adequately protect Greenland.\n\n“With respect to Denmark, Denmark is a tiny country with a tiny economy, and a tiny military,” Miller said of Fox’s Hannity.\n\n“They cannot defend Greenland. They cannot control the territory of Greenland. Under every understanding of law that has existed about territorial control for 500 years, to control a territory you have to be able to defend a territory, improve territory, inhabit a territory. Denmark has failed on every single one of these tests.”\n\nMeanwhile, officials told NBC that the White House has voiced similar criticisms of Canada, which has increased its defense spending but continues to fall short of NATO’s goal.\n\n“The world doesn’t see Canada as a major force when it comes to defense,” the official told NBC.\n\nTrump has previously said “it’s highly unlikely” he would use military force against Canada. But after his shock invasion of Venezuela and the abduction of then-President Nicholas Maduro on Jan. 3., the president has not ruled out deploying U.S. military troops to countries including Colombia, U.S. ally Mexico, and Greenland.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House and to Carney’s representatives for comment.",

    "fullText": "Viktor Onopko is regarded as one of the most gifted footballers Russia has produced. He was a footballing icon for the country, especially in the 90s.\n\nCurrently serving as the assistant manager of the Russian national football team, Onopko has raised a few eyebrows with his statement about Barcelona.\n\nIn a recent interview with El Bigote de Abadía, Onopko revealed that he was linked to Barcelona at one point in his career. But he accused Barça of not signing him because he was ‘ugly’.\n\nOnopko arrived in Spain in 1996, signing for Real Oviedo. He spent six years at Oviedo, featuring in 222 competitive matches before joining Rayo Vallecano in 2002.\n\nA centre-back by trade, Onopko played for Vallecano for just one year before returning to his native Russia, signing for Spartak Alania. He eventually retired in 2006.\n\n“I signed with Oviedo in the summer of 1995, but then I went in the winter. I wanted to put a clause that if a club put in one more dollar, I could go to that club.\n\nOnopko claims he was rejected by Barcelona due to aesthetic reasons. (Photo by Firo Foto/Getty Images)\n\n“They told me yes, but they deceived me. Because Atleti made an offer for me, but I couldn’t go to Atleti,” Onopko began (h/t Forbes).\n\nHowever, the footballer revealed that he was a subject of interest for Barcelona as well, but one of the assistant coaches found him ugly.\n\n“I recently found out that Barcelona wanted to sign me. But [Johan] Cruyff or one of his assistants said I was ugly, and that’s why they didn’t sign me,” he said.\n\nAlthough the move did not work out for Onopko, he still ended up as a hero in La Liga, featuring in over 200 matches in the Spanish top-flight while representing the Russian national team 109 times.\n\nAged 56, Onopko has started his coaching career as well and is currently serving as an assistant for Valeriy Karpin for the Russian national team while simultaneously working as an assistant coach for FC Rostov.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian drone strikes damaged energy networks in Russia-occupied parts of southern Ukraine, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without power on Sunday, according to Kremlin-installed authorities there.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow has kept up its hammering of Ukraine’s energy grid in overnight attacks that killed at least two people, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nMore than 200,000 households in the Russia-held part of Ukraine’s southern Zaporizhzhia region had no electricity on Sunday, according to the Kremlin-installed local governor.\n\nIn a Telegram post, Yevgeny Balitsky said that nearly 400 settlements have had their supply cut, because of damage to power networks from Ukrainian drone strikes.\n\nRussia has hammered Ukraine’s power grid, especially in winter, throughout the nearly four-year war. The strikes aim to weaken Ukrainians’ will to resist in a strategy that Kyiv officials call “weaponizing winter.”\n\nRussia targeted energy infrastructure in Odesa region overnight on Sunday, according to Ukraine’s Emergency Service. A fire broke out and was promptly extinguished.\n\nAt least six people were wounded in the Dnipropetrovsk region from Russian attacks, the emergency service said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a Telegram post that repairing the country’s energy system remains challenging, “but we are doing everything we can to restore everything as quickly as possible.”\n\nHe said that two people were killed in overnight attacks across the country that struck Sumy, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia, Khmelnytskyi and Odesa.\n\nIn total, more than 1,300 attack drones, 1,050 guided aerial bombs and 29 missiles of various types were used by Russia to strike Ukraine this week, Zelenskyy said.\n\n“If Russia deliberately delays the diplomatic process, the world’s response should be decisive: more help for Ukraine and more pressure on the aggressor,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nHe spoke the day after a Ukrainian delegation arrived in the United States for talks on a U.S.-led diplomatic push to end the war.\n\nOn Friday, Zelenskyy said that the delegation would try to finalize with U.S. officials documents for a proposed peace settlement that relate to postwar security guarantees and economic recovery.\n\nIf American officials approve the proposals, the U.S. and Ukraine could sign the documents next week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Zelenskyy said at a Kyiv news conference with Czech President Petr Pavel. Trump plans to be in Davos, according to organizers.\n\nRussia would still need to be consulted on the proposals.\n\nSeparately, in Russia’s Caucasus mountains, two children and an adult were wounded overnight as debris from a Ukrainian drone fell on a five-story residential building in North Ossetia, according to the regional governor.\n\nSeventy people had to be evacuated from the building, in the town of Beslan, and there was damage to its roof and windows, Gov. Sergei Menyaylo said in a Telegram post on Sunday morning.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said that its forces shot down or suppressed 63 Ukrainian drones overnight over Russia and the occupied Crimean Peninsula. One person was hospitalized in Russia’s Krasnodar region east of Crimea following a drone strike, local authorities said.\n\nUkrainian crews have started repair works on the backup power line connecting the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant to the power grid, under a ceasefire brokered by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Vienna-based U.N. organization said in an X post on Sunday.\n\nThe fate of the plant, occupied by Russia and the largest in Europe, is a central issue in ongoing U.S.-brokered peace talks.\n\n“Crucial repair works on the essential back up Ferosplavna-1 330 kV power line connecting Ukraine’s ZNPP to the grid have begun under another IAEA-brokered ceasefire,” the agency said in the post.\n\nThe 330-kilovolt power line, which was damaged and disconnected because of fighting, is crucial to supplying the plant with electricity.",

    "description": "Greenland's natural resources and proximity to Russia and China have made it a valuable strategic asset to the US military since World War II.",
    "fullText": "Visitors to Pituffik Space Base in Greenland are greeted by a sign welcoming them to the \"top of the world.\"\n\nAs the US military's northernmost installation, Pituffik Space Base's operations include scientific research, space surveillance, and missile detection.\n\nGreenland's abundant natural resources and proximity to Russia and China have made it a valuable strategic asset since World War II — so much so that US President Donald Trump has often expressed his intent to purchase the autonomous Danish territory.\n\nVice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance visited the military base in March 2025 amid rising tensions between the US, Denmark, and Greenland.\n\nThose tensions have continued to flare as Trump has refused to rule out the use of military force to take control of Greenland. In a Truth Social post on Wednesday, Trump wrote that the US \"needs Greenland\" and \"anything less than that is unacceptable.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Denmark increased its military presence in Greenland, citing \"security tensions.\" Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio also met with the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland on Wednesday.\n\nHere's a look inside Greenland's only US military base.\n\nTrump first expressed interest in buying Greenland, the world's largest island and an autonomous Danish territory, during his first presidency. In addition to being rich in natural resources, Greenland's Arctic location is well-placed to further US interests by countering China and Russia.\n\nSince his reelection, Trump has repeatedly conveyed his desire to acquire Greenland and said he would not rule out the use of military force to take it.\n\n\"We need Greenland for national security. One way or the other we're going to get it,\" he said in his joint address to Congress in March 2025.\n\nBoth Denmark and Greenland's leaders have maintained that the island is not for sale.\n\nSecond lady Usha Vance was originally scheduled to visit Greenland on a solo trip in 2025 to \"visit historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersua, Greenland's national dogsled race,\" the White House said.\n\nInstead, the trip was scaled back. The vice president and second lady visited Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, the US military's northernmost installation, in March.\n\nUsha Vance's solo trip could have violated diplomatic protocol by sending a delegation to another country without an invitation. The amended plan — visiting a US base — avoided that potential violation. While Trump said that \"people from Greenland are asking us to go there,\" the government of Greenland said they had not invited any foreign delegations to visit.\n\n\"Just for the record, Naalakkersuisut, the government of Greenland, has not extended any invitations for any visits, neither private nor official,\" the government's official Facebook page wrote in a post on Monday.\n\nGreenland's then-prime minister, Múte Bourup Egede, also called Usha Vance's planned trip \"very aggressive\" in an interview with Sermitsiaq, a Greenlandic newspaper.\n\nTaylor Van Kirk, JD Vance's press secretary, told Business Insider at the time that the vice president and second lady were \"proud\" to visit the US military base in Greenland.\n\n\"As the vice president has said, previous US leaders have neglected Arctic security, while Greenland's Danish rulers have neglected their security obligations to the island. The security of Greenland is critical in ensuring the security of the rest of the world, and the Vice President looks forward to learning more about the island.\"\n\nWhile the US doesn't own Greenland, it has had a military presence there since World War II.\n\nPituffik Space Base, originally named Thule Air Base, was formally established in 1951 as part of a Cold War-era defense treaty between the US and Denmark. It is located in Pituffik, Greenland, 750 miles north of the Arctic Circle and halfway between New York and Moscow.\n\nAs a Danish territory, Greenland does not have a military of its own.\n\nAs the Pentagon's northernmost military base, Pituffik Space Base acts as a key Arctic defense outpost. Because of its location on the \"top of the world,\" it is an optimal vantage point for monitoring missile launches by US adversaries like Russia and establishing space superiority.\n\nThe base is the site of a phased-array radar, which can detect sea-launched and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and a surface-to-air missile system, which intercepts hostile threats.\n\nThe base has a Satellite Command and Control system to maintain real-time communications and data relay with military and intelligence satellites. Its high-altitude location also allows it to more frequently track polar-orbit satellites, which can monitor the entire Earth's surface over time as the planet rotates below them.\n\nBecause Pituffik's primary mission is space surveillance and missile warning, the space base doesn't house a permanently stationed fighter wing or naval fleet.\n\nInstead, it acts as a strategic logistics and defense hub for Arctic missions and under-ice operations. From the site, which is the world's northernmost deep-water seaport, surface vessels and submarines operated by the US Navy and allied forces conduct Arctic patrols and cold-weather training exercises.\n\nAircraft regularly fly in and out of the former air base, such as military cargo and refueling planes and maritime patrol aircraft. Occasionally, fighter jets and long-range bombers will fly to the base for Arctic deterrence deployments and training flights.\n\nWhile it doesn't have a permanent combat force, the Air Force does have one tugboat at Pituffik to support port operations, icebreaking, and maneuvering ships.\n\nA small but significant asset, the Rising Star helps keep supply routes open by breaking up and pushing floating ice. The tugboat guides supply ships through the port, making it a critical component in bringing fuel, food, and equipment to personnel year-round.\n\nHowever, since the base is locked in by ice for nine months of the year, the Rising Star gets limited use because it can only be operated when the port is completely ice-free.\n\nPituffik Space Base is surrounded by ice for nine months out of every year. The closest town, the Inuit village of Qaanaaq, is located 65 miles away.\n\nTemperatures can range from 60 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer, when there are 24 hours of daylight, to -50 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, when there is no sunlight for weeks.\n\nWinter storms are categorized into five levels from least to most severe: Normal, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, and Delta. At the Bravo level, the buddy system is implemented so that no one walks outside alone. Non-essential facilities close at the Charlie level, and personnel must shelter in place during Delta storms.\n\nAbout 150 personnel are stationed at Pituffik.\n\nThe Dundas Buffet Dining Hall on base serves three meals a day with payments accepted through a meal card.\n\nThe Base Exchange, also known as \"BX,\" sells groceries, toiletries, souvenirs, and other assorted goods. It also houses a barber shop.\n\nThere are no ATMs at Pituffik Space Base, but the Base Exchange accepts debit and credit cards as well as US dollars.\n\nPituffik Space Base features a bowling alley, a chapel, and a community center with a theater and craft room.\n\nThere's also a gymnasium and workout room stocked with weights and treadmills.\n\nPituffik Space Base's official Facebook page shows personnel participating in recreational events such as a Hawaiian-themed Arctic luau party, Greenlandic Heritage Week, and cross-country skiing.\n\nThe US built airbases and weather stations across the ice sheet during World War II as refueling stops on transatlantic flights and supply routes.\n\nTwo decommissioned airbases are now being used as civilian airports, and a third was abandoned after the war ended.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the US Air Force also built four stations on Greenland's coasts as part of a larger communication network of more than 60 radar installations to detect Soviet bombers. Most of the stations have since been deactivated, left to deteriorate atop Greenland's ice sheet.\n\nIn 2024, NASA scientists detected an underground base for a top-secret Cold War-era missile operation known as Camp Century. Now buried 100 feet under the ice, the abandoned network of subterranean tunnels once operated under the guise of an Arctic research facility before the US government declassified it in 1995.\n\nBut the abandoned military sites represent more than just relics of past global conflicts. Thousands of gallons of biological, chemical, and radioactive waste left behind on the bases pose a significant environmental threat, especially as the planet warms.\n\nThe US military failed to clean up decommissioned facilities like Camp Century, assuming the ice sheet would entomb the waste and infrastructure over the years.\n\nHowever, at the current melting rate of the Arctic, researchers estimate that the waste could resurface around 2100. The question remains as to who is responsible for cleaning up the waste from abandoned US military facilities scattered throughout Greenland.\n\nThe US has long pursued access to or control over Greenland due to its strategic and economic significance, dating back as early as the late 19th century.\n\nSince his return to the White House, Trump has continued to double down on his ambitions to secure the self-governing territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, saying he won't rule out military force or economic coercion to do so.\n\nThough the Danish government has remained steadfast in refusing the sale, Trump's so-called \"real estate deal\" has spotlighted Greenland's growing desire for independence from Denmark and disinterest in being owned by anybody, including the US.\n\n\"The time has come to stand together,\" Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said at a press conference on Tuesday, appearing with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. \"It has not been easy to stand up to completely unacceptable pressure from our closest allies for a lifetime. But there is much to suggest that the hardest part is still ahead of us.\"",

    "description": "Founder of ICE List believes the ‘sophisticated’ cyberattack could have originated in Russia",
    "fullText": "A website dedicated to leaking personal information about Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and Border Patrol agents was reportedly subject to a cyberattack that its founder believes may have originated in Russia.\n\nDominick Skinner, a Netherlands-based immigration activist, told The Daily Beast that his website, ICE List, came under cyberattack Tuesday evening after the publication reported Skinner planned to release personal information, obtained through a whistleblower, about thousands of employees.\n\nThe attack, known as a Direct Denial of Service, is when a perpetrator seeks to disrupt access to a network or service by flooding it with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload the system.\n\nSkinner told The Daily Beast that a massive number of IPs began accessing the website, and a large amount of the traffic appeared to come from Russia – leading the founder to speculate the attack originated there.\n\n“The IPs would be run through proxies before hitting our servers, meaning it’s just impossible to track the source,” Skinner told the publication. “An attack lasting this long is sophisticated, though.”\n\nThe attack, Skinner said, occurred as he prepared to publicly identify the names of immigration law enforcement officers that were obtained in a dataset from the whistleblower.\n\nThe ICE List founder had previously told The Daily Beast that a Department of Homeland Security whistleblower provided a dataset of approximately 4,500 immigration personnel after the shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis.\n\nSome of the information in the dataset included names, email addresses, phone numbers, job titles, and other background information. Skinner said he planned to make a “majority” of the names public but would provide exceptions for those working in childcare or serving as nurses.\n\nDHS has criticized Skinner’s website calling it “disgusting doxxing of our officers” that puts “their lives and their families in serious danger.”\n\nHomeland Security Spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin has said law enforcement are facing a 1,300 percent increase in assaults and an 8,000 percent increase in death threats against them.\n\n“Their families are being threatened. We will not back down. Anyone who doxxes our officers will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” McLaughlin has warned.\n\nICE List is hosted in the Netherlands, so it cannot be taken down by the U.S. government.\n\nSkinner said whoever is attacking the website “doesn’t want others to access the site.”\n\n“But it just makes us more determined, because it is clear some people out there do not want the names of ICE and Border Patrol agents made public,” Skinner told The Daily Beast. “Given their behavior lately, and how they are increasingly viewed negatively by the public, that’s no surprise.”\n\nThe ICE List founder said he and his team have Direct Denial of Service protections in place, but that attacks of this kind are difficult to prevent and likely to happen again.",

He added that Russia remained committed to its agreements with Venezuela, a Russian ally.\n\n\"In general, this and other actions in the ⁠international arena indicate the ‌line of our American colleagues to break the entire system that has been created for many years with their participation,\" ‍he said.\n\nLavrov, who has served as foreign minister since 2004, said the entire international order - along with globalisation - had been \"flushed down the drain\" and was now fragmenting.\n\nWhen asked ​about U.S. threats against Iran, Lavrov said that Moscow needed to keep ‌working with Tehran to implement their bilateral agreements and that no other country could change the nature of ties between Russia and Iran.\n\nLavrov suggested that the United States, by abandoning the principles it had promoted for so long, was damaging its own image.\n\n\"Our American colleagues look unreliable when they act ⁠in this way,\" Lavrov told a news ​conference with his Namibian counterpart in Moscow.\n\nAsked about ​a Bloomberg report that White House envoy Steve Witkoff and U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner are seeking to travel ‍to Moscow to ⁠meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, Lavrov said that Putin had repeatedly said that he is open to serious discussions about peace in Ukraine.\n\nIt ⁠would, Lavrov said, be helpful if Washington briefed Moscow on the latest peace proposals for ‌Ukraine.",

Kennan senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, in a post on Wednesday.\n\nLoans for Venezuela's purchase of Russian weapons could meet the same fate, added Sestanovich, a former ambassador-at-large for the former Soviet Union at the State Department.\n\n\"The overall market appeal of such arms has clearly been diminished,\" following the US's military operation, he wrote.\n\nSome $2 billion to $3 billion in annual trade between Russia and Venezuela could also \"cease altogether,\" he added.\n\nThose concrete economic losses contrast with more intangible political upsides for Moscow in a shifting global order, he added.\n\n\"The Trump administration's emphasis on preserving a US sphere of influence in the Western Hemisphere could also seem to validate Russia's claims for a similar sphere in its own neighborhood,\" Sestanovich wrote.\n\nThe developments come at a sensitive moment for Russia's economy, as its war in Ukraine approaches its fifth year next month.\n\nSweeping Western sanctions and depressed oil prices are squeezing Russia's revenues, putting pressure on the funds Moscow uses to sustain the war effort and support the broader economy.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has not commented publicly on the US's operation in Venezuela. The Russian foreign ​ministry has called for deposed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's release and for dialogue between the US and Venezuela.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian state-owned oil company Roszarubezhneft sought to draw a line around its oil holdings in Venezuela.

The former head of Ukraine’s digital transformation policies is credited with spearheading the the army's drone technology and introducing several successful e-government platforms.\n\nHis appointment was part of a broad government reshuffle that the Ukrainian leader said aimed to sharpen the focus on security, defense development and diplomacy amid a new U.S.-led push to find a peace settlement.\n\nFedorov said the defense ministry is facing a shortfall of 300 billion hryvnia ($6.9 billion) in funding needs.\n\nThe European Union will dedicate most of a massive new loan program to help fund Ukraine’s military and economy over the next two years, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday.\n\nFedorov said Ukraine’s defense sector has expanded significantly since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. At the start of the war, he said, the country had seven private drone companies and two firms developing electronic warfare systems. Today, he said, there are nearly 500 drone manufacturers and about 200 electronic warfare companies in Ukraine.\n\nHe added that some sectors have emerged from scratch, including private missile producers, which now number about 20, and more than 100 companies manufacturing ground-based robotic systems.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "Up to 25,000 Russian soldiers are being killed every month, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said this week.",
    "fullText": "Russia's military is suffering heavy losses fighting in Ukraine, with up to 25,000 soldiers killed a month, NATO's top civilian official said this week, calling the carnage \"unsustainable\" for Moscow.\n\n\"The Russians, at the moment, are losing massive amounts of their soldiers thanks to the Ukrainian defense,\" NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told European lawmakers at a forum in Brussels on Tuesday. He said that 20,000 to 25,000 troops are dying each month as the war drags on.\n\n\"I'm not talking seriously wounded. Killed.\" Rutte clarified. He compared the incredibly high losses to the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, where an estimated 15,000 of its soldiers were killed over a period of more than nine years.\n\n\"Now they lose this amount or \n\nRussia has not disclosed official casualty figures, but Ukrainian and Western estimates paint a grim picture for Moscow.\n\nBritain's defense ministry said in an intelligence update Wednesday that Russia has likely suffered over 1.2 million battlefield casualties since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, averaging 1,100 soldiers killed and wounded every day last month.\n\nRussia's average daily casualty rate from August to December 2025 increased steadily, although it was still lower than during the same months in 2024, according to the ministry. It said the recent uptick came as Moscow made small territorial gains, and the heavy losses are expected to roll into 2026 \"with continued dismounted infantry attacks on multiple axes.\"\n\nRussian forces have been focused on seizing the war-torn city of Pokrovsk in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region for more than a year. It has been the site of some of the war's most intense fighting.\n\nUkrainian officials have said that attack drones are the biggest battlefield killer of people and equipment, believed to be responsible for eliminating around 90% of all targets hit. Military units regularly publish footage of their combat kills on social media.\n\nThe casualty assessments underscore the significant attrition for Russia. It has a much larger population pool from which it can pull new soldiers and replenish losses than Ukraine does. However, Moscow has tried to avoid large-scale involuntary mobilization during the war, and conflict analysts believe it is unlikely to do so anytime soon.\n\nKateryna Stepanenko, a Russia research fellow with the Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank, told Business Insider that Moscow has increasingly relied on covert and informal recruitment networks to avoid a full mobilization, which would likely come at a tremendous political cost.\n\nRussian military efforts to bring fresh troops into its war against Ukraine include offering financial benefits to some informal recruiters, sourcing combat personnel from overseas, and playing with the legislation on the use of active and inactive reserves, among some other unofficial methods, Stepanenko said.\n\n\"Before, the Kremlin just assigned your military recruitment centers, some paramilitary organizations, and regional authorities to do recruitment,\" she said. Now, Moscow has to think: \"Where else can we squeeze recruits from?\"\n\nUS and Ukrainian assessments from last year suggested that Russia was pulling an average of 30,000 to 36,000 new soldiers a month into the war, figures similar to its casualty rate. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said thousands more than that are volunteering.\n\n\"It is certainly a challenge for Russian forces to replace personnel and replace the casualties,\" Stepanenko said, adding that Russia will eventually \"hit a wall\" if it doesn't change its personnel and recruitment system eventually.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine, which does not disclose official casualty figures similar to Russia, is believed to have suffered an estimated 400,000 soldiers killed and wounded. Those losses hit hard, as Ukraine faces a constant struggle for manpower.\n\nThe proliferation of drones over the battlefield has made it increasingly difficult to evacuate casualties from a widening kill zone that extends in both directions along the front line, significantly contributing to the heavy losses.\n\nUkrainian and Western soldiers and officers have said that \"golden hour\" — the first 60 minutes after a severe injury when medical treatment determines whether a soldier lives or dies — is long gone in this war.",

    "fullText": "Global oil prices surged on Tuesday as markets reacted to the escalating drone strikes at the Novorossiysk terminal, which handles roughly 2% of the world's daily supply. The disruption to the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) infrastructure, a vital artery for Kazakh exports managed by Western majors like Chevron and Shell, raised immediate fears of a prolonged supply squeeze.\n\nWhile Brent was trading at $65.13, up 1.9%.\n\nTwo oil tankers waiting to load crude from some of Kazakhstan’s biggest oilfields were hit by drones at the marine terminal of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) near Novorossiysk on Russia’s Black Sea coast, sources told Reuters.\n\nThe Caspian Pipeline Consortium Marine Terminal, a major oil export facility close to Novorossiysk, handles most of Kazakhstan’s crude oil exports, as well as some Russian crude supply.\n\nThe Delta Harmony and the Matilda tankers were waiting to load crude from Tengizchevroil and Karachaganak, respectively, according to Reuters’ sources.\n\nTengizchevroil, operating the supergiant Tengiz oilfield in Kazakhstan, is managed by a consortium led by U.S. oil and gas supermajor Chevron. Karachaganak, another giant field in Kazakhstan, is operated by a consortium comprising Shell, Chevron, and Italy’s Eni, among others.\n\nDrone attacks at or near the CPC terminal have intensified in recent weeks and have affected the loading and departure schedules of Kazakhstan’s crude cargoes.\n\nKazakhstan’s oil output fell sharply at the end of November and early December after damage at the CPC export terminal disrupted flows. Output dropped in the first two days of December after storms and structural damage limited loading capacity at the Black Sea terminal, prompting producers to scale back throughput as storage filled.\n\nKazakhstan relies on the CPC for roughly 80% of its crude exports.\n\nThe disruption came at a sensitive moment for Kazakhstan, which was attempting to stabilize production following repeated CPC interruptions earlier in 2025.\n\nOil has continued to flow, but at lower rates, while Kazakhstan sought to re-route some exports away from the Black Sea to keep supply relatively steady.\n\nCPC operates the pipeline from the Caspian coast in northwest Kazakhstan to the Novorossiysk port, which handles 80% of Kazakhstan’s crude exports from giant oilfields operated by international oil firms.\n\nAffiliates of Chevron and ExxonMobil are also minority shareholders in CPC, with the Russian Federation as its largest shareholder with a 24% stake.",

    "fullText": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States accused Russia on Monday of a “dangerous and inexplicable escalation” of its nearly four-year war in Ukraine at a time when the Trump administration is trying to advance negotiations toward peace.\n\nU.S. deputy ambassador to the United Nations Tammy Bruce singled out Russia’s launch of a nuclear-capable Oreshnik ballistic missile last week close to Ukraine’s border with Poland, a NATO ally.\n\nShe told an emergency meeting of the Security Council that the United States deplores “the staggering number of casualties” in the conflict and condemns Russia’s intensifying attacks on energy and other infrastructure.\n\nUkraine called for the meeting after last Thursday’s overnight Russian bombardment with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles, including the powerful, new hypersonic Oreshnik missile, which Moscow used for only the second time in what was a clear warning to Kyiv’s NATO allies.\n\nThe large-scale attack came days after Ukraine and its allies reported major progress toward agreeing on how to defend the country from further Moscow aggression if a U.S.-led peace deal is struck.\n\nThe attack also coincided with a new chill in relations between Moscow and Washington after Russia condemned the U.S. seizure of an oil tanker in the North Atlantic. And it came as U.S. President Donald Trump signaled he is on board with a hard-hitting sanctions package meant to economically cripple Russia.\n\nMoscow has given no public signal it is willing to budge from its maximalist demands on Ukraine. And Russia's U.N. ambassador on Monday blamed the diplomatic impasse on Ukraine.\n\nEurope’s leaders condemned the attack using the Oreshnik as “escalatory and unacceptable,” and U.S. envoy Bruce was equally tough on Monday.\n\n“At a moment of tremendous potential, due only to President Trump’s unparalleled commitment to peace around the world, both sides should be seeking ways to de-escalate,” she said. “Yet Russia’s action risks expanding and intensifying the war.”\n\nBruce reminded Russia that nearly a year ago it voted in favor of a Security Council resolution calling for an end to the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n“It would be nice if Russia matched their words with deeds,” she said. “In the spirit of that resolution, Russia, Ukraine and Europe must pursue peace seriously and bring this nightmare to an end.”\n\nBut Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council that until Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “comes to his senses and agrees to realistic conditions for negotiations, we will continue solving the problem by military means.”\n\n“He was warned long ago, with each passing day, each day which he squanders, the conditions for negotiations will only get worse for him,” Nebenzia said. “Similarly, each vile attack on Russian civilians will elicit a stiff response.”\n\nUkraine’s U.N. Ambassador Andriy Melnyk countered that Russia is more vulnerable now than at any time since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Its economy is slowing and oil revenue is down.\n\n“Russia wants to sell to this council and the whole U.N. family the impression that it is invincible, but this is another illusion,” he told the council. “The carefully staged image of strength is nothing but smoke and mirrors, completely detached from reality.”",

We don’t want to be Americans, we want to be Greenlanders,” Berthelsen, a former Greenlandic foreign minister, told the Financial Times.\n\n“I don’t want to live in an American empire,” resident Maja Overgaard said in the same report, while fisherman Helte Johannsen dismissed Trump outright: “I don’t think that Trump knows anything about Greenland.”\n\nTrump has ramped up his threats to take over Greenland after the U.S. kidnapped Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro in an unprecedented military move, and said it would run the country during a transition period.\n\nDuring a press gaggle aboard Air Force One on Sunday, the president was asked whether he was still planning U.S. military action against Greenland, an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\n“If we don’t take Greenland, Russia or China will,” Trump said. “And I’m not letting that happen.”\n\nWhen asked if Greenland could “offer” him anything, he said, “Sure, I’d love to make a deal with them, that’s easier. But one way or the other, we’re gonna have Greenland.”\n\nTrump made a similar threat in a speech to Congress in March.\n\nOn Sunday, he clarified his approach: “Look, we’re talking about acquiring, not leasing, not having it short term. We’re talking about acquiring. And if we don’t do it, Russia or China will. And that’s not going to happen when I’m president.”\n\nHe repeated the threat Friday, telling reporters, “We are going to do something in Greenland, whether they like it or not,” and added he would “do it the hard way” if a deal could not be reached.\n\nDenmark and Greenland have consistently rejected the idea, warning that U.S. military action could threaten NATO and emphasizing that Greenland is not for sale.\n\nLast week, Greenland’s government and opposition issued a joint statement: “We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders. The future of Greenland must be decided by the Greenlandic people.”\n\nGreenland, home to around 56,000 people mostly near Nuuk, is largely covered by ice but holds strategic and economic importance. Its location makes it vital to U.S. military early-warning systems, and melting ice has opened access to valuable resources, such as rare-earth minerals, drawing growing international interest.\n\n“It’s not fun being 56,000 people and having these threats—if you can call them that—from a giant like the US,” Masaana Egede, editor of Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq, told the BBC last week.\n\n“The citizens of Greenland are nervous about this, because this is not something that we take lightly.”\n\nA 2025 Verian poll showed that only 6 percent of Greenlanders are in favour of becoming part of the U.S., with 9 percent undecided.",

    "fullText": "A Ukrainian drone strike killed one person and wounded three others in the Russian city of Voronezh, local officials said Sunday. Meanwhile, thousands of residents were still without power in Kyiv, following an intense Russian bombardment.\n\nA young woman died overnight in a hospital intensive care unit after debris from a drone fell on a house during the attack on Saturday, Voronezh regional Gov. Alexander Gusev said on Telegram.\n\nThree other people were wounded and more than 10 apartment buildings, private houses and a high school were damaged, he said, adding that air defenses shot down 17 drones over Voronezh. The city is home to just over 1 million people and lies some 250 kilometers (155 miles) from the Ukrainian border.\n\nUkraine's General Staff said Sunday said its forces hit three drilling platforms operated by Russian oil giant Lukoil in the waters of the Caspian Sea. Ukraine’s long-range drone strikes on Russian energy sites aim to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue its full-scale invasion.\n\nThe attacks came after Russia bombarded Ukraine with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles overnight into Friday, killing at least four people in the capital Kyiv, according to Ukrainian officials. For only the second time in the nearly four-year war, Russia used a powerful new hypersonic missile that struck western Ukraine in a clear warning to Kyiv and NATO.\n\nUkraine’s largest private energy supplier, DTEK, said Sunday that 30,000 people in Kyiv were still without power following the attack. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said Friday around half the apartment buildings — nearly 6,000 — in snowy Kyiv were left without heat in daytime temperatures of about minus 8 degrees Celsius (17.6 Fahrenheit).\n\nThe intense barrage and the launch of the nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile followed reports of major progress in talks between Ukraine and its allies on how to defend the country from further aggression by Moscow if a U.S.-led peace deal is struck.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday in his nightly address that Ukrainian negotiators “continue to communicate with the American side.”\n\nChief negotiator Rustem Umerov was in contact with U.S. partners on Saturday, he said.\n\nSeparately, Ukraine’s General Staff said Russia targeted Ukraine with 154 drones overnight into Sunday and 125 were shot down.\n\nThe Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s main intelligence directorate said Sunday that Russia this month deployed the new jet-powered “Geran-5” strike drone against Ukraine for the first time. The Geran is a Russian variant of the Iranian-designed Shahed.\n\nAccording to the directorate, the drone can carry a 90-kilogram (200-pound) warhead and has a range of nearly 1,000 kilometers (620 miles).\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "Sgt. Dimko Zhluktenko, a commander of a drone team, told Business Insider what it was like flying in the heavy fog that Russia used to its advantage.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sgt. Dimko Zhluktenko, an ISR drone team leader in Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces. He deployed in 2025 near Pokrovsk, a key city that Russia said it captured in early December.\n\nBusiness Insider has verified his role in the Ukrainian armed forces. The article has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBefore the full-scale war, I was a software engineer, working for companies in San Francisco, New Zealand, and Germany.\n\nToday, I lead a team of five to six Ukrainian drone operators. Our task is to use high-flying drones to provide reconnaissance data to our troops and commanders.\n\nWith our intelligence, artillery such as HIMARS and drone strike teams can target Russian equipment and soldiers, often before they can even reach the front lines.\n\nWe were redeployed to the Pokrovsk area in August because the fighting there had become so intense. Because drone operators are priority targets in the war, we would spend our dayslong rotations in houses and underground bunkers outside the city.\n\nWhen we first arrived, the weather was sunny and ideal for flying.\n\nBut the end of October was a disaster for us. Ukraine turns foggy in the autumn, with thick and low clouds that can stack from 100 meters to 300 meters above the ground.\n\nThese are so thick that no infrared camera or thermal camera can see through them, and caused many days to be completely no-go for flying for our types of drones.\n\nAt the time, the Russians took advantage of the clouds, using them to cover their advance on foot and in vehicles. Given the weather, the number of personnel they sacrificed to take the city, and our limited resources, there was eventually no viable way for us to defend Pokrovsk forever.\n\nUkraine is dependent on drone warfare. It has carried us through the terrible and scary times of these Russian assaults, and it has changed the face of war. For the entire summer of 2025, for example, I saw a tank only twice on the battlefield.\n\nDrones are cheap and effective, and if we had an infinite number of drones, we would have been working 24/7 to fight the Russians in Pokrovsk.\n\nBut we don't have infinite drones, so in the meantime, we need other strike tools and resources, such as more artillery fire and troops. War is complex, and drones cannot be its only solution.\n\nIn normal conditions, we fly our drones four times a day, with each flight lasting about three to four hours and sometimes into the night. It's tiring, but worth it, because you can make an enormous difference for Ukrainian defenders. We can spot where Russian forces are moving, denying them the element of surprise, and scout for assets such as air defenses and artillery for commanders to strike.\n\nRecon drone operators like us rely heavily on visual navigation. We study Pokrovsk so closely that, even when our drone is being spoofed, we can determine our flying location simply by the shape of the terrain or landmarks.\n\nWhen the foggy season comes, we try to make the most of any good visibility. Sometimes, you can get lucky and perform five flights in a five-day rotation.\n\nHowever, there were days when we found ourselves sitting in a house, just waiting for the weather to clear.\n\nYou can try to fly under the clouds, but going low means our bulky drones are more easily spotted and destroyed. Since we have limited tools, we try to preserve them and not use them recklessly.\n\nStill, on days with strong winds, there's a chance that the clouds may break slightly and give you glimpses of the battlefield. Sometimes, when visibility is bad but not impossible to work with, we must risk flying in such weather, especially if our troops are defending against a major assault.\n\nIn late summer, the situation in Pokrovsk was becoming increasingly problematic, both on the ground and in the sky. Back in the day, we would help long-range artillery focus on the Russian rear.\n\nI began to notice that Russia's tactics were making an impact around September.\n\nAcross the warzone, their strategy is to find our limit and overwhelm it with the smallest number of soldiers needed to seize our positions.\n\nIt is simple mathematics. Initially, they would send around 10 soldiers. If that wasn't enough, they would send 20. Then they would try 30.\n\nDay by day, they increase the number of troops and equipment. Their goal is to create a situation where we don't have enough drones to counter the amount of attacking infantry.\n\nTo eliminate an assault of 50 guys, all spread out, we'd need at least 150 drones and artillery, which is difficult for us to organize with our limited resources.\n\nWhen we were working in Pokrovsk, there were already areas of the city where the Russians had advanced, so the fighting area was porous and undefined.\n\nIf we had more troops, we could have held out for much longer and performed more aggressive maneuvers.\n\nIf we had more recon drones, our team could have flown over Pokrovsk nonstop, working despite the clouds.\n\nWith more first-person-view strike drones, our pilots could continue to find and attack the Russians closer to the ground.\n\nBut we don't have enough. So, we need other strike tools besides FPV drones, even though they account for about 80% of our kills on Russians.\n\nIronically, some of these tools have disappeared because warfare has changed so much. Mortars might have helped, but we mostly stopped using them — the battlefield is now so transparent that it is a suicide mission to ride around close to the front line in your pickup truck with a mortar.\n\nWhat we definitely need is artillery ammunition. Last year, some HIMARS units I worked with were rationed to four strikes a week.\n\nOther artillery units were limited to just three artillery shells a day. We would find them a target, and they would say: \"We don't have any more for today. Sorry, guys.\"\n\nThe weather in this season means it is still what drone pilots call our \"low season.\" At the same time, the terrain is now not too muddy, so it is the perfect time for Russians to attack.\n\nThis month, I am redeploying to Dnipro. The fight continues.",

    "description": "Ukraine said the \"Geran-5\" bears similarities to Iran's Karrar attack drone, and uses a more powerful engine than Russia's current turbojet Shaheds.",
    "fullText": "Russia has attacked Ukraine with a new type of long-range drone that uses a powerful jet engine to fly 600 miles with a 200-pound explosive warhead, Kyiv's military intelligence agency said.\n\nThe Ukrainian intelligence directorate, or GUR, released a statement on Sunday providing new details about what it dubbed the \"Geran-5.\"\n\nGUR said the drone was used during an attack in early 2026.\n\n\"Unlike previous modifications of the 'Geran' line, the device is made according to a normal aerodynamic scheme,\" GUR said, adding that the Geran-5 bears a strong resemblance to Iran's Karrar attack drone.\n\nPublished images showed wreckage of the apparent device on snow-laden ground, which included long fixed wings attached to a slender chassis. Business Insider could not independently verify the location and date of the images.\n\nThe Geran-5 is roughly 20 feet long, with a wingspan of about 18 feet, GUR added.\n\n\"The warhead weighs about 90 kg, and the declared range is about 1,000 km,\" the intelligence agency said.\n\nRussia's Geran drone family is most often associated with the Iranian-designed Shahed loitering munition. The Geran-1, Geran-2, and Geran-3 are inexpensive, mass-manufactured drones modeled after the Shahed but tweaked for production inside Russia.\n\nWhile the new drone's design differs significantly from that of the typical Shahed, GUR said it was being classified as a type of Geran because it shares many key components with Russian Shahed-like drones.\n\nThese include a jet engine made by Telefly, a Chinese company, and a microcomputer that GUR said is modeled after Raspberry Pi, a UK-designed low-cost computer that fits on a small board.\n\nThe Geran-3, a newer drone resembling Iran's Shahed-238, was earlier reported by Ukraine to use a Telefly JT80 turbojet engine that allows the device to fly at speeds of up to 230 miles per hour.\n\nGUR said the Telefly engine on the Geran-5 generates even more thrust, but did not give specifics about the drone's speed.\n\nUkrainian authorities have said that they've found Raspberry Pi 4 computers on Russia's more commonly used Geran-2s. These drones, modeled after the Shahed-136, are Russia's main tool in the hundreds-strong waves bombarding Ukraine and require computers for functions such as transmitting navigation data to operators.\n\nTelefly did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Business Insider. The Raspberry Pi Foundation did not respond to a similar request sent outside regular business hours.\n\nGUR said that the Geran-5 also uses 3G and 4G modems, as well as a 12-channel Comet, otherwise known as Kometa, satellite navigation system. The Kometa is typically known to use multiple antennas, which makes it more resistant to jamming.\n\n\"As with previous 'geraniums,' this UAV is difficult to consider as a Russian Federation development,\" GUR said.\n\nNotably, the intelligence agency said it had information that Russia is looking to launch the Geran-5 from another aircraft, such as the Sukhoi Su-25 fighter jet.\n\nUsing the drone in this way would likely greatly increase its operational range, since the Su-25 can fly out a distance before launching the Geran-5. Russia has typically been launching its older Gerans from ground-based ramps in Western Russia, annexed Crimea, and occupied Ukraine.\n\n\"Separately, the possibility of equipping the aircraft with R-73 air-to-air missiles to counter Ukrainian aviation is being considered,\" GUR said.\n\nThe R-73 is a Soviet-era heat-seeking missile, also known as the AA-11 Archer by NATO, designed to be fired from fighter jets to attack other aircraft.\n\nUkraine has previously said that it found Russia had mounted some of its Geran-2s with the R-60, an older air-to-air missile, to target aircraft such as helicopters trying to hunt down drones.",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of targeted terror against the people of his country following heavy airstrikes during the past week.\n\nZelensky posted on social media on Sunday that within the past week the Russian military had used against Ukraine around 1,100 drones, 890 guided bombs and 50 rockets and cruise missiles, including the medium-range ballistic missile Oreshnik.\n\nThe weapons were fired \"at targets that have no military significance: energy facilities and residential buildings,\" Zelensky said.\n\nMoscow had deliberately waited for the frosty weather to make life as hard as possible for ordinary Ukrainians, Zelensky argued. \"This is deliberate, cynical Russian terror against the people,\" he wrote.\n\nHe illustrated his words with video clips of drone damage to civilian objects in Kiev and the surrounding area, as well as in the regions of Kharkiv, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Odessa, Zaporizhzhya and Chernihiv. Images from the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, where the Oreshnik missile struck, were not shown.\n\nThe Kremlin portrays the ongoing bombardment of Ukraine as strikes against exclusively military targets, even though the destruction of power plants affects the civilian population.\n\nMoscow has recently raised its own accusations of terror against Kiev, claiming that Ukraine allegedly launched a drone attack on one of the residences of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nZelensky vehemently denied this and the US foreign intelligence service, the CIA, concluded that Ukraine did not target Putin or one of his residences, according to US media reports.\n\nPutin ordered the war against Ukraine nearly four years ago.",

    "description": "The U.S. is considering buying Greenland to secure its strategic interests in the Arctic, as Russia and China invest heavily in the region, and a negotiated transfer with compensation for Denmark would be the most effective way to secure the territory without resorting to force.",
    "fullText": "The White House is speaking loudly about Greenland. But volume should not be mistaken for madness. This isn’t a sudden lapse into imperial fantasy — it is power politics, plain and unsentimental, dressed in modern language but driven by old truths.\n\nGeography still governs fate. Distance can still protect or imperils nations. Ice still melts, routes still open, and rivals still move. Greenland sits at the center of it all — a vast slab of territory that dominates the map not by population, but by consequence.\n\nSet aside the outrage and the pearl-clutching, and the case becomes clear. Seen through a realist lens — the kind John Mearsheimer describes — power is never polite. Nations do not glide through history on good will. They compete, maneuver, and block rivals wherever they can.\n\nAmerica didn’t invent this contest, but it has played it for a century, shaping trade routes, locking down strategic chokepoints, and denying rivals room to expand. Exiting now would not end the game — it would simply forfeit the advantage.\n\nGreenland matters because the Arctic matters. Melting ice has turned what was once a frozen buffer into a contested corridor. Shipping lanes are emerging. Subsea cables snake across the ocean floor. Missile paths shorten. Surveillance gaps narrow. Russia knows this. China knows this. Both are investing heavily in Arctic presence, infrastructure and influence. The U.S. can either treat Greenland as a distant curiosity or as what it actually is: a forward position in a region that will define future power balances.\n\nThis is why the talk of acquiring it refuses to die. Under Trump, it has resurfaced less from recklessness than from bluntness. He says aloud what others preferred to bury in briefings. Previous administrations whispered the same concerns behind closed doors, then settled for half-measures and cosmetic compromises. Trump simply said the quiet part out loud, with his usual lack of decorum and surplus of disruption. Allies recoiled. But in cold political terms, offense is secondary to advantage.\n\nThe preferred path is obvious and needs no justification. Buying Greenland is better than bullying it. A negotiated transfer, with guarantees for Greenlanders and compensation for Denmark, would be cleaner, cheaper, and far less destabilizing than any military move. War in the Arctic would be absurd, expensive and counterproductive. Even floating the idea of force is less about intent than leverage. It is a reminder that the U.S. takes the matter seriously, not a rehearsal for invasion.\n\nCritics insist Greenland’s future is not Washington’s to decide. Formally, they are right. Strategically, however, that statement is comforting nonsense. In a world of rising rivalry, no great power allows vital terrain to drift into adversarial hands out of courtesy. Sovereignty is sacred until security is threatened; then it becomes negotiable. This isn’t cynicism, but the hard ledger of history.\n\nThe U.S. bought Louisiana not out of generosity, but to deny France control of the Mississippi. It backed Panama’s break from Colombia to secure a canal it deemed vital. It purchased Alaska to keep Russia away from its doorstep. Britain took Gibraltar for the same reason: Position beats principle when survival is involved. States talk reverently about borders, right up until borders threaten them. When security tightens, ideals are revised.\n\nThe European backlash, while predictable, is also revealing. Europe benefits enormously from American security guarantees, but recoils whenever Washington acts like a power rather than a charity. There is something faintly comic about NATO allies warning the U.S. against taking its own defense too seriously. The alliance rests, after all, on the assumption that America has never been a feelings-first power. Greenland reveals whether it still remembers that.\n\nEuropean nations insist Greenland is not for sale, while quietly relying on American troops, money and missiles to keep the peace that permits such comfortable posturing. It is a bit like lecturing the fire brigade on property rights while borrowing their hoses. Principles are easier to defend when someone else pays the insurance.\n\nThe deeper issue is not Trump’s rhetoric but America’s reluctance to admit what it is. The U.S. remains a global power in a competitive world. It cannot afford strategic blind spots disguised as virtue. Greenland is not a vanity project or a colonial hangover — it is a strategic anchor, a surveillance platform, a logistical hub, and a denial asset, all wrapped up into one. To lose influence there would not cause immediate collapse, but it would mark a significant retreat, the kind rivals notice long before voters do.\n\nThat is why this moment feels different. The language is sharper. The signals are stronger. Force remains the last resort, and rightly so. It is expensive, corrosive and unpredictable. Buying Greenland would cost money and pride, but far less than conflict. Realism doesn’t require hostility. The United States has often secured vital positions without resorting to force.\n\nIt gained long-term access to Iceland during World War II because the island mattered more than diplomatic niceties. It maintained strategic basing in Okinawa through negotiation, despite local resistance, because geography demanded it. It built Diego Garcia into a major military hub through negotiation and agreement rather than force. In each case, American security was strengthened without open conflict.\n\nGreenland deserves the same treatment now. Serious talks that reflect its importance. Offer fair payment to Denmark, respect local self-rule, and protect U.S. interests without turning the Arctic into an unnecessary flashpoint. Trump has his sights set on Greenland because the map leaves little room for alternatives.\n\nJohn Mac Ghlionn is a writer and researcher who explores culture, society and the impact of technology on daily life.",
