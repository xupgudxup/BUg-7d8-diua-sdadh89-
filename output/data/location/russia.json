    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The United States is offering Ukraine security guarantees for a period of 15 years as part of a proposed peace plan, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday, though he said he would prefer an American commitment of up to 50 years to deter Russia from further attempts to seize its neighbor’s land by force.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump hosted Zelenskyy at his Florida resort on Sunday and insisted that Ukraine and Russia are “closer than ever before” to a peace settlement.\n\nNegotiators are still searching for a breakthrough on key issues, however, including whose forces withdraw from where and the fate of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, one of the 10 biggest in the world. Trump noted that the monthslong U.S.-led negotiations could still collapse.\n\n“Without security guarantees, realistically, this war will not end,” Zelenskyy told reporters in voice messages responding to questions sent via a Whatsapp chat.\n\nUkraine has been fighting Russia since 2014, when it illegally annexed Crimea and Moscow-backed separatists took up arms in the Donbas, a vital industrial region in eastern Ukraine.\n\nDetails of the security guarantees have not become public but Zelenskyy said Monday that they include how a peace deal would be monitored as well as the “presence” of partners. He didn’t elaborate, but Russia has said it won’t accept the deployment in Ukraine of troops from NATO countries.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump were expected to speak in the near future but there was no indication the Russian leader would speak to Zelenskyy.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Kyiv’s allies will meet in Paris in early January to “finalize each country’s concrete contributions” to the security guarantees.\n\nTrump said he would consider extending U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine beyond 15 years, according to Zelenskyy. The guarantees would be approved by the U.S. Congress as well as by parliaments in other countries involved in overseeing any settlement, he said.\n\nZelenskyy said he wants the 20-point peace plan under discussion to be approved by Ukrainians in a national referendum.\n\nHowever, holding a ballot requires a ceasefire of at least 60 days, and Moscow has shown no willingness for a truce without a full settlement.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump slathered a fresh coat of makeup on his hand for another round of peace talks with Ukraine on Sunday.\n\nTrump, 79, welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to his Mar-a-Lago estate as he continues to chase down an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, which he promised to end on his first day back in office.\n\nThe mismatched concealer on Trump’s hand was once again evident as he took questions from reporters.\n\nJust days ago, on Christmas Eve, the now-familiar bruising on Trump’s right hand was coupled with some discoloration on his left. On Sunday, however, his left hand seemed back to normal, while his right hand remained covered in makeup.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reverted to a statement she has been reusing since February when reached for comment by the Daily Beast.\n\n“President Trump is a man of the people and he meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other President in history. His commitment is unwavering and he proves that every single day,” she said.\n\nLeavitt previously attributed the persistent bruising to “minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has closely catalogued the bruising on Trump’s hand, which he has been nursing for months. The makeup smears, together with Trump’s swollen ankles, mysterious MRI, mental flubs, and twice-in-a-year “annual” medical checkups, have raised concerns about the health of the oldest person to be inaugurated president.\n\nThe White House has consistently maintained that Trump is in “excellent health.”\n\nThe president was joined by several of his officials in Mar-a-Lago as he sat down for another meeting with Zelensky, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, special envoy Steve Witkoff, and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nA day before the meeting, Russia struck Kyiv with ballistic missiles and drones, killing at least one person and injuring 27 others.\n\nDespite the attack, Trump said he still believed Russian President Vladimir Putin was “very serious” about finding common ground with Ukraine.\n\n“I do believe that we have the makings of a deal that’s good for Ukraine, that’s good for everybody. There’s nothing more important,” he told reporters. “I’ve settled eight wars and this is the most difficult one. I thought it would be in the middle of the pack. This is the most difficult one, but we’re gonna get it done.”\n\nThe president stopped short of laying out a timeline for the end of peace talks.\n\n“I don’t have deadlines,” he said. “You know what my deadline is? Getting the war ended.”",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Several key issues remain unresolved in ongoing negotiations between Ukraine and the United States over a potential framework to end Russia’s war, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last week. Speaking about a 20-point plan under discussion, Zelenskyy outlined the most difficult points, noting that Ukraine has already conveyed its position to Washington, which is expected to communicate it to Moscow.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday that the Kremlin had already been in contact with U.S. representatives since Russian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev recently met with U.S. envoys in Florida. However, he did not reveal any details, saying only: “It was agreed upon to continue the dialogue.”\n\nZelenskyy said talks continue over the nature and scope of security guarantees that would be provided to Ukraine under any agreement. He said several technical issues remain, including how guarantees would be enforced and what monitoring mechanisms would be used to ensure compliance.\n\nZelenskyy said the fate of the territories that Russia claims remain the most difficult issue in the talks. He did not provide details, but has repeatedly said Kyiv will not recognize Russian control over occupied regions, including areas seized since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. Zelenskyy has also repeatedly stated Ukraine will not cede territories it currently controls, which Russia has publicly demanded.\n\nZaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant\n\nZelenskyy said the future of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains unresolved. The facility, Europe’s largest, has been under Russian control since early on in the war and has raised repeated international safety concerns due to fighting nearby.\n\nUkraine has been consistent in saying that safe operation of the station requires demilitarization of its territory, where Russia currently has troops stationed. Apart from that, Ukraine has been insisting that Ukrainian workers should be granted full access to the station, which they currently don’t have.\n\nDetails previously released in the course of the current negotiations revealed that the U.S. and Ukrainian teams are in discussion of a joint-access format, potentially between all three sides (the U.S., Ukraine, and Russia).\n\nZelenskyy said further discussions between Ukrainian and U.S. teams are expected, including talks in Florida, and that separate documents on economic recovery and prosperity are also under consideration.",

    "fullText": "Republican senators have joined Democrats to issue a pointed message to Donald Trump as he prepares to meet with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nZelensky, 47, will travel to Mar-a-Lago on Sunday to discuss a possible peace agreement to end Russia’s war in Ukraine with Trump, 79, who previously tried to bully Ukraine into accepting a U.S.-brokered deal favorable to Vladimir Putin.\n\nAfter Putin, 73, hit Ukraine with hundreds of drones and missiles over Christmas, GOP senators Thom Tillis, Jerry Moran, and John Barrasso, along with Democratic colleagues, offered a reminder that Putin, 73, is a “ruthless murderer.”\n\n“Today’s decision by Putin to launch attacks rather than hold fire is a sobering reminder for us all: Putin is a ruthless murderer who has no interest in peace and cannot be trusted,” reads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee release.\n\nThe senators added, “It bears repeating that President Zelenskyy agreed to a Christmas truce, but Putin declined, yet he directs soldiers to continue to commit brutal crimes of aggression on one of Christianity’s holiest days.”\n\nTillis, 65, a senator from North Carolina, Moran, 71, a senator from Kansas, and Barrasso, 73, a senator from Wyoming, were joined by Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, Jacky Rosen, Chris Coons, Jeff Merkley, and Chris Van Hollen, as well as Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats.\n\nThe message was not joined by more MAGA-friendly members of the committee, including its Republican chairman Jim Risch and Texas’ Ted Cruz.\n\nOnce firmly in control of congressional Republicans, Trump’s influence has weakened in recent months as his approval rating has plummeted and the GOP has lost in contests across the country.\n\nThe defeats suggest a path for Democrats to reclaim at least partial control of Congress in the 2026 midterms by flipping the House and even the Senate, leaving Trump to serve the remainder of his second term as a lame-duck president.\n\nMoreover, the trio of Republican senators is largely free from electoral pressure: Tillis is retiring in 2027, Moran faces reelection in 2028, and Barrasso in 2030.\n\nCritics have long accused Trump of playing into Putin’s hands while being hostile towards Ukraine and other traditional allies.\n\nIn recent months, he launched a diplomatic push to end the war, which began with Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022, but his proposed peace plan initially reflected many of Putin’s demands, blindsiding Zelensky and European allies.\n\nThe demands included limitations on Ukraine’s military and, crucially, the surrender of territory to Russia.\n\nLast month, Trump melted down at Ukraine on Truth Social, claiming that Zelensky had shown “ZERO GRATITUDE” in a message echoing his tantrum at their contentious Oval Office meeting in February. Zelensky responded by thanking Trump again.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader announced Thursday that he’d had a “good conversation” with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nHe told reporters Friday that he plans to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine with Trump on Sunday, as well as the “sensitive issue” of possible territorial concessions.\n\nWhile Zelesnky said the 20-point plan under discussion “is about 90% ready,” he cautioned, “Russia constantly looks for reasons not to agree.”",

    "title": "Drones keep shutting down European airports. This hybrid warfare could be a sign of worse to come, one analyst says.",
    "description": "Over 10,000 travelers have been disrupted by drone sightings near airports in recent months. Russia's hybrid warfare could be testing the limit.",
    "fullText": "It started in Copenhagen. Around 8:30 p.m. on a Monday in late September, a few large drones were spotted flying near the airport.\n\nAll takeoffs and landings were halted for almost four hours. More than 50 flights were diverted, and over 100 more were canceled.\n\nOn the same day, 30 flights were disrupted at Oslo Airport in Norway due to another suspected drone sighting.\n\nIn the past few months, several more European cities have seen nearby drones temporarily shut down their airports. It happened twice within 24 hours in Munich in early October. Over 10,000 people have had their travel plans disrupted.\n\nIn one sense, this is a nuisance for travelers. However, analysts and political leaders say it's an example of Russia's hybrid warfare.\n\nThis strategy involves using plausible deniability to undermine a society and can also include disinformation and cyberattacks.\n\nAs Blaise Metreweli, the chief of the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, said in her inaugural speech on December 15: \"The new frontline is everywhere.\"\n\nDrones have also been spotted near air bases, but the impact has been most palpable in Lithuania, the Baltic nation of less than 3 million people, whose eastern border is less than 70 miles as the crow flies from Russia's westernmost edge.\n\nOver the past 10 weeks, the airport in Vilnius, the capital, has been shut down 15 times. And not due to drones, but balloons smuggling crates of cheap cigarettes over the border from Belarus.\n\n\"They are also difficult to detect because they're not big aircraft or drones,\" said Sean Patrick, senior aviation security analyst at Osprey Flight Solutions.\n\n\"It is quite clever exploiting this from the Russian side to use these systems, and they've pushed Lithuania to declare this emergency.\"\n\nThirteen days before the Scandinavia incidents, around 20 Russian drones flew across the border into Poland. The airspace over four Polish airports was closed while NATO forces scrambled jets, shooting down up to four of the drones.\n\nPoland also invoked Article 4 of the NATO treaty, which calls for consultation over an urgent situation — its first usage since the start of the Ukraine War in 2022.\n\nThen, a Russia-linked ship was located off the Danish coast during the Copenhagen incident. The French military later boarded the oil tanker, and the captain, a Chinese national, was charged with one count of refusing to follow instructions from the French navy.\n\n\"A lot of these ships have changed their names quite recently,\" Patrick said. \"They've got new flags. It makes it very hard to follow who's doing what, who's working for who.\"\n\nHowever, at other points, links to Russia have been less clear. Police in Norway closed their investigation into the Oslo incident, saying there wasn't enough evidence that there were actually any drones.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has denied the country's involvement.\n\nIn an analyst report earlier this month, Osprey Flight Solutions said: \"It remains unconfirmed whether any/all of the … incidents are directly linked.\"\n\n\"Osprey assesses that some of the drone sightings are likely to be false identifications — i.e. not drones.\"\n\nIn July 2024, a package exploded in a DHL freight center in Leipzig, Germany. The head of the country's domestic intelligence service said it was \"only a lucky coincidence\" that the delayed package caught fire on the ground, rather than during flight.\n\nSimilar fires occurred at depots in Poland and the UK. Then, this September, Lithuanian prosecutors charged 15 people with terrorism offences, the BBC reported.\n\nThey said the individuals, with links to Russian intelligence, put explosive devices in vibrating massage pillows, which were set off with electronic timers. The parcels were all shipped from Lithuania.\n\nInvestigators have also said they believe these were dry runs aimed at sabotaging flights to the US and Canada.\n\n\"You can't see Europe going to war with Russia over some balloons in Lithuania,\" Patrick told Business Insider. \"And then it's where do you get to the limit? Does Europe want to find out what the limit is?\"\n\n\"So that's the concern,\" he added. \"If they do blow up a railway or set off an incendiary device on a transatlantic flight, what's the next step? Do people want to find out that next step?\"\n\nThe incidents highlight how Europeans face a new reality since the war in Ukraine began in 2022.\n\nEven Dublin Airport — over 1,500 miles from Kyiv — experienced a drone incident. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had arrived in the Irish capital ahead of schedule earlier this month, before the drones were spotted nearby.\n\nSome European leaders have called for building a drone wall — a system of air defenses in the east of the continent to stop drones launched from Russia.\n\nWhile discussions continue over a peace deal in Ukraine, tensions are likely to remain high.\n\n\"Even if the Ukraine war comes to some sort of hold, ceasefire, peace agreement, I think we can expect Russia to continue these,\" Patrick said. \"They've got a taste for it now.\"",

    "fullText": "An explosion in Moscow on Wednesday killed three people, including two police officers, Russian investigators said, days after a car bomb killed a high-ranking general not far away.\n\nAn official from Ukraine’s military intelligence, known as GUR, told The Associated Press that the attack had been carried out as part of an agency operation. Another official from the agency said the police officers had taken part in Russia’s war in Ukraine, without providing details. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\n\nRussian authorities did not comment on who may be behind the attack. Since Moscow invaded nearly four years ago, Russian authorities have blamed Kyiv for several assassinations of military officers and public figures in Russia. Ukraine has claimed responsibility for some of them.\n\nOn Wednesday, two traffic police officers were approaching a suspicious individual when a device detonated, Russia's Investigative Committee spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko said in a statement. The officers and another person standing nearby died from their injuries.\n\nThe Interior Ministry named the officers as Lt. Ilya Klimanov, 24, who joined the Moscow police in October 2023, and Lt. Maxim Gorbunov, 25. Gorbunov had a wife and a 9-month-old daughter, the statement said.\n\nThe blast took place in the same area of the Russian capital where Lt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov was killed by a car bomb on Monday. Sarvarov was the head of the Operational Training Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces’ General Staff.\n\nInvestigators have said they are looking into whether Ukraine was behind that attack, which was the third such killing of a senior military officer in just over a year. Ukraine has not commented on it.\n\nUkraine — which is outnumbered by Russia’s larger, better equipped military — has frequently tried to change the course of the war by attacking in unexpected ways.\n\nIn August last year, Ukrainian forces staged a surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region even as they struggled to stem Russian offensives elsewhere. Moscow’s troops eventually drove them out, but the incursion diverted Russian military resources and raised Ukrainian morale.\n\nIn June, swarms of drones launched from trucks targeted bomber bases across Russia.\n\nMoscow has also blamed assassinations on Ukraine. Just over a year ago, Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the chief of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed by a bomb hidden on an electric scooter outside his apartment building. Kirillov’s assistant also died. Ukraine’s security service claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nDays after Moskalik’s killing, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he received a report from the head of Ukraine’s foreign intelligence agency on the “liquidation” of top Russian military figures, adding that “justice inevitably comes” although he didn’t mention Moskalik’s name.\n\nMeanwhile, Western officials have accused Russia of staging a campaign of disruption and sabotage across Europe as part of an effort to sap support for Ukraine. Moscow has denied the claims.",

    "fullText": "Like many of his US counterparts, the Russian science prodigy turned hugely successful ‘digital populist’ has a deep suspicion of government constraint\n\nTech visionary, Kremlin dissident, FSB agent, free speech absolutist, health guru. These are just some of the labels admirers and critics have attached to Pavel Durov over the past decade.\n\nThe Russian-born tech entrepreneur founded Russia’s version of Facebook before going on to create the messaging app Telegram, launch a cryptocurrency ecosystem and amass a multibillion-dollar fortune, all while clashing repeatedly with authorities in Russia and beyond.\n\nBut much of Durov’s real story – and the logic that drives him – remains obscured.\n\nA new biography aims to change that.\n\nThe Populist, by the independent Russian writer Nikolay Kononov, traces the 41-year-old’s rise from a St Petersburg schoolboy science prodigy to the founder of Telegram, one of the world’s most influential communications platforms, which has more than a billion users.\n\nKononov describes the book as the product of a 14-year attempt to map Durov’s strategy and mindset, drawing on conversations with Durov himself and people who worked with him, as well as rivals and critics.\n\nThe book’s title, he said, refers to a thread running through Durov’s life: his desire to address Telegram’s millions of users directly, allowing him to bypass institutions, the press and any system of representation.\n\n“Durov is one of the first digital populists,” Kononov said in an interview, explaining that “from the very beginning, as soon as he started making his digital products, he programmed into them the ability to write and communicate his ideas directly to his audience.”.\n\nBoth VKontakte, Durov’s first venture, and Telegram have at times pushed messages from Durov directly to all users, including users who had not opted in, outlining his libertarian worldview.\n\n“He sees himself as a visionary. And obviously wants to be heard,” the author said.\n\nThat strategy has helped promote Durov’s central promise – almost absolute freedom of expression – even as Telegram has become a go-to tool for dissidents, extremists, scammers and war propagandists.\n\nIf Durov’s public brand is built on libertarianism, Kononov says his private management style points in the opposite direction: power concentrated in one man’s hands, with few visible checks.\n\n“He is essentially the only one making all the product decisions at Telegram,” Kononov said. “Marketing, PR – it’s a one-man show.”\n\nThe portrait he draws is of a tech founder whose worldview has not wavered over the years, remaining most comfortable within an ultra-libertarian, anti-institutional strand of the right that is often misogynistic and, at times, conspiratorial.\n\n“What surprised me most is that Durov hasn’t changed or evolved in all the years that I have interviewed him,” Kononov said.\n\nDurov is not an outlier, Kononov writes, but part of a broader new wave of moguls – most visibly in the US – who pair technological dominance with an outsized sense of personal mythology and a deep suspicion of government constraint.\n\nLike Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Jeff Bezos, he has shown a strong interest in longevity science as well as pronatalism, the belief that having as many children as possible is a social or civilisational duty.\n\nDurov does not drink or use drugs, Kononov says, regularly dispenses spartan health advice – often alongside photos of him shirtless – and has said he has fathered dozens of children through sperm donation.\n\nOne of the book’s most striking sections tells for the first time of Durov’s tense early meeting with President Vladimir Putin in 2014, held behind closed doors.\n\nKononov writes that Durov described the encounter as a one-way conversation, in which the Kremlin leader reprimanded him over illegal content on Vkontakte and suggested that Durov leave the country.\n\nUnder pressure from the authorities, Durov sold his stake in Vkontakte, left Russia and eventually settled in Dubai, where he founded Telegram.\n\nBut the clearest mark on Durov in recent years, Kononov suggests, came not from Russia but from France.\n\nDurov, who also holds French citizenship, was detained and held for three days in France in August last year as part of an investigation into crimes linked to Telegram, including the circulation of child sexual abuse images, drug trafficking and fraudulent transactions.\n\nHis detention came as a shock to the tech mogul. In interviews conducted in Paris after his arrest, Durov described to Kononov a harsh, disorienting ordeal – a permanently lit cell and little sleep – that rattled a man who had spent years insulating himself from the reach of the state.\n\nIt also appears to have sharpened his hostility towards the west. Kononov says Durov now frames Europe as sliding toward “total digital control”, and increasingly conspiratorial rhetoric.\n\nMost recently, Durov appeared to endorse a conspiracy theory promoted by the far-right blogger Candace Owens, suggesting that Paris was behind the killing of Charlie Kirk.\n\n“What interests me about Durov is that, on the one hand, he clearly has a very high IQ,” Kononov said. “But at the same time, he is prone to conspiracy theories.”\n\nKononov is adamant, however, that Durov’s views should not be conflated with formal political allegiances.\n\nOne of the most persistent claims surrounding Durov is that he is secretly aligned with Russian security services.\n\nBut Kononov said that in the course of his research, he found no evidence that Durov has worked with, or on behalf of, the Russian state. “He has a huge number of flaws – but not the sin of Telegram acting as a backdoor for the FSB,” Kononov said.\n\nKononov argues that what Durov has ultimately learned is the need to compromise – with both Russian and western authorities – when it serves his interests and allows Telegram to continue operating.\n\nKononov recalls Durov once telling him: “I never waste time on things that are unnecessary or that cannot be useful to me personally.” That self-serving mindset, Kononov said, ultimately ended their personal relationship.\n\nAbout a year ago, the writer asked Durov whether he saw a contradiction between Telegram’s highly centralised, almost authoritarian internal structure and his professed devotion to freedom of expression. After that, Durov stopped responding.\n\n“He quickly realised it wasn’t going to be a book to his liking,” Kononov said.",

    "description": "When Vladimir Putin made a four-day trip to visit Xi Jinping in September, he addressed his Chinese counterpart as a “dear friend”.",
    "fullText": "When Vladimir Putin made a four-day trip to visit Xi Jinping in September, he addressed his Chinese counterpart as a “dear friend”.\n\nSpeaking to Xi across a vast display of orchids in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, the Russian president claimed their ties were “at an unprecedentedly high level”.\n\nCertainly on the surface it appears China’s alliance with Russia has only grown stronger since Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nNowhere has this been more evident than when looking at trade between the two countries, which has boomed ever since the West slapped Putin with massive sanctions.\n\nLast year, the value of trade between Russia and China hit a record $245bn (£182bn), fuelled by Xi becoming the world’s largest buyer of Putin’s oil and gas. Overall, China also became Russia’s biggest supplier of goods.\n\nHowever, closer ties with China have come at a cost.\n\nIn particular, Russian businesses have grown increasingly frustrated at a flood of cheap Chinese goods.\n\nVladimir Milov, who worked in the Russian government from 1997 to 2002 before becoming a vocal Putin critic, says the economic alliance is backfiring badly for Russia.\n\n“It is deeply disadvantageous,” he says. “China is taking advantage because it knows that Russia has nowhere to go.”\n\nSuch warnings could signal that the economic ties between the two countries are beginning to fray.\n\nWhile mutual trade hit a record high in 2024, it has fallen by nearly a tenth so far this year.\n\nOne key area of tension is cars.\n\nAfter Western manufacturers cut ties with Russia in 2022, Chinese competitors duly stepped in.\n\nIn the two years to 2024, Chinese car exports to Russia have increased sevenfold, prompting a growing number of complaints from domestic manufacturers.\n\nMaxim Sokolov, the chief executive of Russian carmaker AvtoVAZ, has accused the Chinese of “unprecedented dumping”, which he said in December has crossed “all imaginable boundaries”.\n\nSales of his company’s signature Lada car have plunged, pushing the company to slash production by nearly half and move to a four-day work week at the end of September.\n\nRussia’s largest truck manufacturer, Kamaz, also trimmed its working week in August after demand for its vehicles plunged by 60pc. At the time it blamed “excessive” imports.\n\nTo alleviate some of the criticism, the Kremlin has responded by significantly raising import fees on vehicles.\n\nSince October 2024, Russia has more than doubled the “recycling fee” that it charges on imported cars.\n\nThis charge, which is supposedly to cover the future disposal of the vehicle but functions largely as a tariff, was 667,000 roubles (£6,275) per vehicle as of January this year.\n\nThis led to Chinese car exports to Russia halving in the first six months of 2025.\n\nIn July, Russian regulators also banned truck imports from a fleet of major Chinese brands – Dongfeng, Foton, FAW and Sitrak – which they branded a “direct threat” to public safety.\n\n“These trade-related tensions will start to occur more and more as the market gets saturated with Chinese goods and uncompetitive Russian industries are not able to make their sales,” says John Kennedy, a research leader at Rand.\n\nThere are signs that Russia’s steel sector is also hurting.\n\nAndrey Gartung, chief executive of the Chelyabinsk Forging and Press Plant, warned last year: “Russian enterprises competing with Chinese ones are holding on by the skin of their teeth.”\n\nNot one to shy away, China has hit back with trade restrictions of its own.\n\nMost notably, Xi reintroduced tariffs on Russian coal in January 2024, two years after the restrictions were first lifted.\n\nThis has already hit exports to China, with Milov claiming that the levies are adding to what is the worst crisis for Russia’s coal industry since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe sector’s revenues are expected to plummet by 12pc this year alone.\n\nElsewhere, China has so far refused to lift a longstanding ban on imports of Russia’s largest agricultural exports – winter wheat and barley. Instead, it buys from Ukraine and Kazakhstan.\n\nWhat China does import from Russia, it gets incredibly cheaply because it has a monopoly as one of Russia’s only buyers, says Milov.\n\nRussia’s biggest exports to China are oil and gas, which combined make up two thirds of its trade.\n\nIgor Sechin, Rosneft’s chief executive, said that between January 2022 and June 2024, China’s savings from purchasing Russian oil compared to Middle Eastern exports amounted to as much as $18bn.\n\n“Taking the sanctions away, Russia is what Beijing would want every trading partner to look like,” says Gregor Sebastian, of Rhodium’s China Corporate Advisory team.\n\n“China is importing raw materials that it produces into manufactured goods that it can then resell at much higher profit margins back to Russia. That is the main bulk of the relationship.”\n\nHowever, more than anything, Russia wants new technology and investment from China. And it is not getting it.\n\nThe average annual flow of Chinese investment into Russia has plummeted from an average of $1.2bn from 2011 to $400m, says Milov.\n\nIn 2022, China dropped Russia from its Belt and Road financing programme, while in July, China’s commerce ministry “strongly advised” carmakers against investing in Russia.\n\nMany major projects that were previously announced with Chinese backing have now been scrapped or are on hold.\n\nRussia quietly disappeared from what was supposed to be a joint development of a long-haul aircraft with the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China.\n\nWork had already begun on the project, initially called the CR929, which stood for “China Russia”. However, the R has now been dropped, with the aircraft renamed as the C929.\n\nPlans for Chinese CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles to build a high-speed rail line between Moscow and Kazan in south-west Russia have also been paused.\n\nSeparately, there has been no progress on the development of the Tianjin oil refinery, a joint venture between Rosneft and the Chinese National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), which was approved in 2014.\n\nAfter the meeting between Putin and Xi in September, Gazprom announced that the two countries had signed a deal to build a “Power of Siberia 2” gas pipeline to China.\n\nBut while this would no doubt prove to be a huge victory for Russia, China has yet to confirm the project.\n\nThis may be a sign that, for all the pomp and ceremony, the countries’ authoritarian alliance may be weaker than it appears.\n\n“Despite all these hugs and kisses at summits, China and Russia are very much far apart,” says Milov.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "Russia has accused Ukraine of carrying out a number of high-profile attacks against prominent Russians since Moscow invaded its neighbor nearly four years ago.\n\nWhile Kyiv has hinted at its involvement in some cases, Ukrainian officials have often stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility. In other cases, they have denied all involvement.\n\nOn Monday, a Russian general was killed by a car bomb in Moscow, and investigators say they are looking into whether Ukraine was behind the attack. Ukraine has not yet commented on the death of Lt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov.\n\nOther attacks that Russia has blamed on Ukraine include:\n\nKirillov, head of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed alongside his assistant, Ilya Polikarpov, when a bomb planted on a scooter exploded outside an apartment building in Moscow in December 2024.\n\nKirillov had been charged in absentia a day earlier by Ukraine’s Security Service, the SBU, with ”ordering the use of banned chemical weapons against Ukraine’s Defense Forces.” The SBU later claimed responsibility for the attack. An Uzbek man was quickly arrested and charged with killing Kirillov on the security service’s behalf.\n\nMoskalik, a deputy head of the main operational department of the General Staff, was killed in April 2025. A bomb had been placed underneath his car, which was parked near his apartment building just outside Moscow.\n\nSeveral days after the attack, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a statement that the country’s Foreign Intelligence Service had informed him of the “elimination of senior command personnel of Russia’s armed forces,” but gave no further details.\n\nA Russian man who previously lived in Ukraine pleaded guilty to carrying out the attack and said that he had been paid by Ukraine's security services.\n\nRzhitsky, a former submarine commander, was gunned down in July 2023 while jogging in Krasnodar, Russia.\n\nUkrainian media reported that Rzhitsky was one of six submarine commanders able to launch the long-range missiles that hit Vinnytsia, Ukraine, a year earlier, killing 23 people and wounding over 100.\n\nWhen he died, Rzhitsky was deputy head of a military mobilization office in Krasnodar.\n\nKyrylo Budanov, head of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s main intelligence directorate, denied Kyiv’s involvement in the death. However, the agency also released details about the killing, including the time of the attack and the number of shots fired. A dual Russian-Ukrainian citizen was convicted in the killing in October 2024.\n\nPrilepin, a nationalist Russian writer, narrowly avoided death in a car bombing in Russia’s Nizhny Novgorod region in May 2023. His driver was killed, while Prilepin was hospitalized with broken bones, bruised lungs and other injuries.\n\nPrilepin, known for his support of the war, was sanctioned by the European Union.\n\nA Ukrainian was found guilty of the attack in a Russian court and sentenced to life imprisonment. Russia’s Investigative Committee accused him of working on orders from Kyiv.\n\nIn an interview with Ukrainian journalists in March 2024, SBU chief Lt. Gen. Vasyl Maliuk declined to take responsibility for the attack, but said he could provide some details, such as Prilepin's injuries.\n\nTatarsky, a military blogger, was killed in April 2023 when a bomb tore through a cafe in central St Petersburg where he had been speaking.\n\nTatarsky supported the war in Ukraine and filed regular reports from the front for his Telegram followers.\n\nDarya Trepova was convicted of the bombing and sentenced to 27 years in prison after she was seen on camera presenting a small statue to Tatarsky that exploded shortly afterward. Trepova testified she didn’t know the gift contained a bomb.\n\nIn the March 2024 interview, SBU chief Maliuk also declined to take responsibility for Tatarsky's death, but describing the blogger as a mouthpiece for Russia who had \"paid a karmic price before the Ukrainian people.” He also provided details on the bomb that killed Tatarsky.\n\nKyva, a Ukrainian lawmaker who fled to Russia shortly after the full-scale invasion, was found dead near Moscow in December 2023 with a gunshot wound to the head.\n\nA controversial political figure in Ukraine before the war, Kyva often appeared on pro-Kremlin TV talk shows. A month before his death, a Ukrainian court found him guilty in absentia of treason and sentenced him to 14 years in prison.\n\nRussia’s state Investigative Committee accused an Armenian-born businessman of passing on details about Kyva’s movements to the SBU, state news agency Tass said. However, no charges have been brought directly related to the killing.\n\nAndriy Yusov, a spokesman for Ukraine’s military intelligence, said after Kyva’s death that “the same fate will befall other traitors of Ukraine,” but did not say who was behind the killing.\n\nDugina was killed in August 2022 when a remote-controlled bomb planted in her SUV blew up as she drove on Moscow’s outskirts.\n\nHer father, Alexander Dugin, was widely believed to be the intended target. The philosopher, writer and political theorist is an ardent supporter of the war.\n\nUkraine denied responsibility for the attack, with Zelenskyy saying Dugina was “not our responsibility\" and Kyiv was \"not interested in her.”\n\nRussia’s Federal Security Agency, the FSB, publicly identified two Ukrainian citizens as suspects, but said they had escaped abroad.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "Russia has sent the cavalry to the front line in its latest low-tech attempt to claim land in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region.\n\nVideo footage shared by Ukraine’s 92nd Brigade shows drones hunting down Russian soldiers as they race through an open field on horseback.\n\nIn the clip, a Russian soldier is seen riding as a drone tracks his movement. Moments later, the drone strikes, hitting the soldier as he attempts to escape. The explosion spooks another horse, which unseats its rider before making a charge in another direction. A third rider is seen, but his fate is unknown.\n\n“Russian occupiers lose so much equipment during their ‘meat-grinder assaults’ that they’re forced to move on horseback,” the 92nd Brigade wrote in a post accompanying the footage.\n\nVladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine has been defined by rapid technological advances on the front lines, in particular in drone warfare. Small, off-the-shelf explosive drones have proved effective at defending against mechanised units and infantry.\n\nRussia recently introduced motorbikes and all-terrain vehicles as a way to speed across open countryside monitored by drones.\n\nHorses could offer yet more flexibility – agile on off-road terrain and less likely to trigger modern landmines equipped with magnetic sensors. The first horse-mounted casualty was reported by observers of the war in Ukraine in October.\n\nAt the same time, The Telegraph reported that the Storm unit of Russia’s 9th Brigade of the 51st Army had been preparing horse-mounted assault teams to operate in the Donetsk region.\n\nBefore this, there had been numerous reports of Russia utilising donkeys, horses and even camels to transport ammunition and other heavy equipment to the front line through muddy conditions not suitable for regular vehicles.\n\nThroughout the ages, horseback cavalry charges have provided speed, shock and flexibility on the battlefield.\n\nTanks and other heavily-armoured fighting machines are rarely seen on the battlefields of Ukraine and, when they do appear, they are almost instantly disabled by a wave of drones.\n\nRussia’s Kommersant newspaper said of the return of cavalry: “In armed conflicts that have become arenas for showcasing technological innovations, participants are once again forced to rely on basic tools – from analogue telephone lines to pack animals and carts – when modern technologies prove vulnerable.”\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Initial drafts of U.S. proposals for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia meet many of Kyiv's demands, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday, although he suggested that neither side in the almost four-year war is likely to get everything it wants in talks on reaching a settlement.\n\n“Overall, it looks quite solid at this stage,” the Ukrainian leader said of recent talks with U.S. officials who are trying to steer the neighboring countries toward compromises.\n\n“There are some things we are probably not ready for, and I’m sure there are things the Russians are not ready for either,” Zelenskyy told reporters in Kyiv.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has for months been pushing for a peace agreement, but the negotiations have run into sharply conflicting demands from Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nU.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday he held “productive and constructive” talks in Florida with Ukrainian and European representatives, though Trump was less effusive the following day, saying, “The talks are going along.”\n\n“We are talking. It's going OK,\" Trump said Monday while on vacation at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Asked if he planned to speak to Zelenskyy or Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump didn't say, offering only of the fighting, “I'd like to see it stopped.”\n\nZelenskyy, meanwhile, said “nearly 90%” of Ukraine’s demands have been incorporated into the draft agreements.\n\nThe backbone of the proposed deal is a 20-point plan, he said. There is also a framework document on security guarantees between Ukraine, European countries, and the United States, as well as a separate document on bilateral security guarantees granted to Ukraine by the U.S.\n\nZelenskyy mentioned several key points, such as the Ukrainian army remaining at a peacetime level of 800,000; membership in the European Union; and European forces, under the leadership of France and the U.K. and with a “backstop” from Washington, ensuring “Ukraine’s security in the air, on land, and at sea.”\n\n“Some key countries will provide presence in these domains; others will contribute to energy security, finance, bomb shelters, and so on,” the Ukrainian president said.\n\nUkraine is arguing that the bilateral document with the U.S. should be reviewed by the U.S. Congress, with some details and annexes kept classified, Zelenskyy said.\n\nThe U.S. team is now in talks with Russian envoys, and Washington has asked that no details be released, he added.\n\nUkraine strikes deep inside Russia\n\nZelenskyy said Monday he met with his military commanders who reported that defensive lines are holding firm against the Russian onslaught.\n\n“In (recent) weeks, the Russian army has significantly increased the intensity of attacks, and the number of Russian losses has increased accordingly,” he said in a post on Telegram.\n\nUkrainian forces hit an oil terminal, a pipeline, two parked jet fighters and two ships in a series of strikes on Russian soil, officials said Monday.\n\nThe attacks are part of an ongoing campaign to disrupt the Russian war effort and sow fear behind the front line, where outnumbered Ukrainian troops are straining to hold back Russia’s bigger army.\n\nThe strikes also seek to undermine Putin’s attempt to portray Russia as negotiating from a position of military strength in U.S.-led peace efforts, which have yet to make a breakthrough on key points.\n\nThe killing of a top Russian general by a car bomb in Moscow on Monday, with investigators suspecting Ukraine was behind it, could be another instance of Kyiv picking surprise targets.\n\nUkrainian partisans burn Russian fighter jets\n\nUkrainian forces struck the Tamanneftegaz oil terminal, an ammunition depot and a launch site for attack drones inside Russian territory and Russian-held Ukrainian territory, Ukraine’s General Staff said in a statement Monday.\n\nA pipeline, two docks and two ships were damaged in the southern Krasnodar region, and a large blaze broke out, the statement said, without specifying what kind of weapons were used in the attack.\n\nIt added that a Ukrainian-made missile also hit a temporary base for Russia's 92nd River Boat Brigade in Olenivka, in the occupied Crimean Peninsula.\n\nA separate strike targeted an ammunition depot in a Russian-controlled portion of the Donetsk region, aiming to slow the Russian advance there, the General Staff said. A Russian launch site for attack drones was also hit.\n\nUkrainian partisans set fire to two Russian jet fighters in an operation on Sunday evening at a base near Lipetsk, a city in western Russia, according to Ukraine’s military intelligence.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Defense said only that its forces shot down 41 Ukrainian drones overnight, three of them over the Krasnodar region.\n\nRussia targets the power grid again\n\nMeanwhile, Russian forces kept up their targeting of Ukraine’s energy sector, aiming to deprive civilians of heat and running water during the frigid winter. Russia has tried to knock out power in Ukraine throughout the war, in a tactic that Ukraine refers to as “weaponizing winter.”\n\nEnergy infrastructure across five regions were attacked during the night, Ukraine’s Ministry of Energy said.\n\nRussia struck Ukraine with 86 drones of different types overnight, Ukraine’s air force said. Ukrainian forces stopped 58 of them, it said.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

Fanil Sarvarov, head of the Operational Training Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces' General Staff, died from his injuries, said Svetlana Petrenko, the spokesperson for Russia’s Investigative Committee, the nation's top criminal investigation agency.\n\n“Investigators are pursuing numerous lines of inquiry regarding the murder. One of these is that the crime was orchestrated by Ukrainian intelligence services,” Petrenko said.\n\nSince Moscow sent troops into Ukraine nearly four years ago, Russian authorities have blamed Ukraine for several assassinations of military officers and public figures in Russia. Ukraine has claimed responsibility for some of them. It has not yet commented on Monday's death.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that President Vladimir Putin had been immediately informed about Sarvarov's killing.\n\nThe Defense Ministry said that Sarvarov had previously fought in Chechnya and taken part in Moscow's military campaign in Syria.\n\nJust over a year ago, Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the chief of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed by a bomb hidden on an electric scooter outside his apartment building. Kirillov's assistant also died. Ukraine’s security service claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nAn Uzbek man was quickly arrested and charged with killing Kirillov on behalf of the Ukrainian security service.\n\nPutin described Kirillov’s killing as a “major blunder” by Russia’s security agencies, noting they should learn from it and improve their efficiency.\n\nIn April, another senior Russian military officer, Lt. Gen. Yaroslav Moskalik, a deputy head of the main operational department in the General Staff, was killed by an explosive device placed in his car parked near his apartment building just outside Moscow. A suspected perpetrator was quickly arrested.\n\nDays after Moskalik's killing, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he received a report from the head of Ukraine’s foreign intelligence agency on the “liquidation” of top Russian military figures, adding that “justice inevitably comes\" although he didn't mention Moskalik's name.",

    "fullText": "A White House envoy said Sunday he held “productive and constructive” talks in Florida with Ukrainian and European representatives to end the nearly four-year war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nPosting on social media, Steve Witkoff said the talks aimed at aligning on a shared strategic approach between Ukraine, the United States and Europe.\n\n“Our shared priority is to stop the killing, ensure guaranteed security, and create conditions for Ukraine’s recovery, stability, and long-term prosperity. Peace must be not only a cessation of hostilities, but also a dignified foundation for a stable future,\" U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy said.\n\nThe talks are part of the Trump administration’s monthslong push for peace. Trump has unleashed an extensive diplomatic push to end the war, but his efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands by Moscow and Kyiv. Putin has recently signaled he is digging in on his maximalist demands on Ukraine, as Moscow’s troops inch forward on the battlefield despite huge losses.\n\nWitkoff's assessment comes as negotiations have been proceeding with Russia as well. A Kremlin envoy said Saturday that the talks were pressing on “constructively” in Florida.\n\n“The discussions are proceeding constructively. They began earlier and will continue today, and will also continue tomorrow,” Kirill Dmitriev told reporters in Miami on Saturday. There were no immediate updates on the talks with Russia on Sunday.\n\nDmitriev met with Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported.\n\nFor Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram Sunday that diplomatic efforts were “moving forward quite quickly, and our team in Florida has been working with the American side.”\n\nThe Kremlin denied Sunday that trilateral talks involving Ukraine, Russia and the U.S. were under discussion, after Zelenskyy said Saturday that Washington had proposed the idea of three-way discussions.\n\n“At present, no one has seriously discussed this initiative, and to my knowledge it is not being prepared,” Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said, according to Russian state news agencies.\n\nUkrainian civilians moved to Russia\n\nIn Ukraine, the country’s human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets on Sunday accused Russian forces of forcibly removing about 50 Ukrainian civilians from the Ukrainian Sumy border region to Russian territory.\n\nWriting on Telegram, he said that Russian forces illegally detained the residents in the village of Hrabovske on Thursday, before moving them to Russia on Saturday.\n\nLubinets said he contacted Russia’s human rights commissioner, requesting information on the civilians’ whereabouts and conditions, and demanding their immediate return to Ukraine.\n\nThe French presidency on Sunday welcomed Putin’s willingness to speak with President Emmanuel Macron, saying it would decide how to proceed “in the coming days.”\n\n“As soon as the prospect of a ceasefire and peace negotiations becomes clearer, it becomes useful again to speak with Putin,” Macron’s office said in a statement. “It is welcome that the Kremlin publicly agrees to this approach.”\n\nThe statement came after reports that Putin was open to holding talks with the French president if there was mutual political will.\n\nEuropean Union leaders agreed on Friday to provide 90 billion euros ($106 billion) to Ukraine to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years, although they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds. Instead, they were borrowed from capital markets.",

    "description": "The Ukrainian drone schools training operators for the fight with Russia take safety steps like giving staff polygraph tests and hiding.",
    "fullText": "The leaders of several drone schools training Ukraine's operators for the fight against Russia say they're targets and they have to act accordingly — tightly protecting information and even moving around.\n\nThroughout its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has launched huge drone and missile barrages at factories, training sites, and civilian infrastructure across the country, often far from the fighting in the east, straining Ukrainian defenses and serving as a constant reminder that nowhere in the country is completely safe.\n\nDrones are prolific on the battlefield in Ukraine. Operators are priority targets. It stands to reason the schools training them for war would be too. Officials from three drone schools told Business Insider that they take steps to avoid getting hit.\n\nTetyana, a Ukrainian veteran who goes by the call sign \"Ruda\" and is now the head of R&D for Dronarium, a drone training school with sites in Kyiv and Lviv, said that it must follow strict safety rules because \"the entirety of Ukraine is not safe, missile-wise, drone-wise.\"\n\nDmytro Slediuk, head of the education department at Dronarium, told BI the safety measures, including not disclosing publicly exactly where its training centers are located and also changing their location \"from time to time,\" are necessary to prevent Russia from interfering with its training\n\nTo keep certain location data from getting out, the school doesn't allow photos and videos that might reveal where its facilities are based.\n\nThe school has been mentioned by Russia's military bloggers, influential pro-war accounts that often circulate operational details and commentary to large audiences. Though they are typically in favor of the war, they are also sometimes critical of Russia's performance and dispute some of its defense ministry's claims.\n\nRybar, a media outlet with 1.5 million Telegram subscribers, listed Dronarium as an example of Ukraine's drone training efforts. The UK has sanctioned Rybar, initially presented as a milblogger but actually a partially Russian government-sponsored information warfare operation, and the US has offered up to $10 million for information.\n\nTetyana said Russian outlets have been writing about the school since 2022, the year Russia started its full-scale invasion. \"As long as they write and talk about us, it means that they are afraid of us,\" she said. But it also means that they're on Russia's radar.\n\nShe said the school and its attendees strictly adhere to a set of critical cybersecurity rules, and said there are also general safety rules in place. \"When the air raid siren is on, all training activities, all the work, everything gets suspended, and we deconcentrate and get into safe shelters.\" She said no one is complacent.\n\nVitalii Pervak, CEO of another training school, Karlsson, Karas & Associates, said that safety steps are crucial because \"the Russians are constantly hunting for places where military personnel gather.\"\n\nUkrainian officials have confirmed that Russia has hit some Ukrainian military training sites, killing personnel. It's the kind of thing air defenses can try to prevent, but Ukraine has suffered shortages throughout the war. Ukraine has also successfully hit Russian bases and gatherings of Russian personnel.\n\nThe key is to prevent Russia from gaining sufficient knowledge of the school to target it. Its steps include \"everyone who works at KK&A, including the cleaners,\" having to do a polygraph security interview.\n\nHe said they don't share any information about the location of the training center or about the appearance of the instructors or cadets.\n\n\"Some of our employees may have relatives or acquaintances in occupied territories who could be tortured by Russians for indirect contact with someone who opposes Russia,\" Pervak said. \"This secrecy also protects the instructors and cadets themselves, as well as their relatives, from attacks by Russian agents.\"\n\nHe said that while the added security \"hinders publicity to some extent — good things should be spoken about loudly — war dictates its own conditions. We are well aware that failing to observe the principles of secrecy may result in the death of staff or cadets.\"\n\nViktor Taran, the CEO of the Kruk Drones UAV training center, said that \"Russia is interested in destroying us.\"\n\n\"Thanks to God and air defence, we're still operating.\"",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW (AP) — President Vladimir Putin emphasized Friday that Moscow’s troops were advancing across the battlefield in Ukraine and voiced confidence the Kremlin would achieve its goals militarily if Kyiv doesn't agree to Russia's conditions in peace talks.\n\nSpeaking at his tightly orchestrated annual news conference that lasted about 4 1/2 hours, Putin declared that Russian forces have “fully seized strategic initiative” and would make more gains by year's end.\n\nIn the early days of the conflict in 2022, Ukraine's forces thwarted an attempt by Russia’s larger, better-equipped army, to capture the capital of Kyiv. But the fighting soon settled into grinding battles, and Moscow's troops have made slow and steady progress over the years. Putin frequently touts this progress — even though it's not the lightning advance many expected.\n\n“Our troops are advancing all across the line of contact, faster in some areas or slower in some others, but the enemy is retreating in all sectors,” Putin said at the live news conference, which is combined with a nationwide call-in show that offers Russians across the country the opportunity to ask questions of their leader.\n\nPutin, 73, has ruled the country for 25 years and uses the event to cement his power and air his views on domestic and global affairs during a broadcast that mixes criticism of the West with promises of more social payments. Although he is sometimes asked about his personal life, he gives scant details.\n\nThis year, the news conference took place against the backdrop of a peace plan in Ukraine put forward by U.S. President Donald Trump. Despite the extensive diplomatic push, Washington’s efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands from Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nWhile the event has previously focused heavily on domestic questions — and has offered Putin a chance to expound on topics from the price of eggs to water cuts — Ukraine dominated it this year. Since it is highly choreographed, that could reflect the Kremlin’s desire to assuage the public after nearly four years of fighting.\n\nRussian demands remain unchanged\n\nPutin praised Trump's peace efforts and reaffirmed that Moscow was ready for a peaceful settlement that would address the “root causes” of the conflict, a reference to the Kremlin’s tough conditions for a deal. He said he has agreed to make “certain compromises” and “uneasy decisions” at the Alaska summit with Trump in August but didn't elaborate.\n\nHe wants all the areas in four key regions captured by his forces, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory. He has also insisted that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in eastern Ukraine that Moscow’s forces haven’t captured yet. Kyiv has publicly rejected all these demands.\n\nThe Kremlin has also insisted that Ukraine abandon its bid to join NATO and warned that it wouldn't accept the deployment of any troops from members of the military alliance members and would view them as “legitimate target.”\n\nPutin also has repeatedly said Ukraine must limit the size of its army and give official status to the Russian language — demands he has made from the outset of the conflict.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine’s bid to join NATO if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to alliance members. But at the same time, he has emphasized that Ukraine believes NATO membership remains the best security guarantee.\n\n″The United States don’t see us in NATO, for now,\" Zelenskyy said this week. “Politicians change.”\n\nCommenting on Zelenskyy's statement that he was ready to call a presidential election if a ceasefire is established, Putin responded that Russia has held elections without demanding a truce. He said that Moscow was ready to consider the issue and could agree to halt attacks deep inside Ukraine on the election day, but noted that millions of Ukrainians living in Russia must have the right to vote. Ukraine introduced martial law banning elections, but Russia hasn't made such a move.\n\nPutin rebuffed Western claims about purported Russian plans to attack European nations as “sheer nonsense” aimed at deflecting public attention from domestic problems.\n\nHe particularly singled out NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte for his statements about the Kremlin's aggressive intentions, pointing out Trump's recently published national security strategy that doesn’t name Russia as a direct adversary. “How can you prepare NATO for a war with Russia if the main member of NATO doesn't consider us as an enemy?” Putin said.\n\nHe alleged that European elites “impudently” backed Trump's Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election and now hope the U.S. political landscape will change after the midterm elections to Congress, helping raise pressure on the White House.\n\nPutin says seizing Russian assets will backfire\n\nAs it faces grinding Russian advances across the front line and relentless attacks on its energy facilities, Ukraine desperately cash infusions from its Western allies.\n\nOn Friday, European Union leaders agreed to provide a massive interest-free loan, but they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds.\n\nThe leaders tried to reassure Belgium, where most of the frozen assets are held, that they would protect it from any retaliation from Moscow if it backed the plan, but the leaders eventually opted to borrow the money on capital markets.\n\nUsing Russian assets to help Kyiv would have amounted to “robbery,” Putin said, adding that the move would have spooked investors, “dealing not only an image blow but undermining confidence in the eurozone.”\n\nPutin says troop numbers are strong\n\nPutin said the flow of volunteer soldiers has remained strong, topping 400,000 this year. It was not possible to independently verify that claim since little is known about the recruitment effort.\n\nBut the government offers relatively high pay and extensive benefits that have helped swell troop ranks. The Kremlin says it exclusively relies on volunteers to fight in Ukraine, but some media reports and rights groups have said that military officers often coerce conscripts into signing military contracts.\n\nAsked by a soldier’s widow about slow pension payments, Putin apologized and vowed the issue would be quickly resolved — a typical exchange at the annual event, which he often uses to show his command of a wide array of subjects and his ability to solve problems.\n\nThe news conference featured questions from journalists in the Gostinny Dvor amphitheater as well as via video links from across Russia. A young man in a red bow tie who held a placard saying he wanted to get married used his question to Putin to propose to his girlfriend. Later, one of the anchors hosting the event reported that she had answered “yes,” and Putin joked about collecting money for the wedding.",

    "fullText": "Dec. 19 (UPI) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Polish President Karol Nawrocki discussed mutual concerns during a private meeting in Warsaw on Friday.\n\nThe meeting was the first between the two European leaders since Nawrocki was inaugurated as Poland's new president on Aug. 6, and they discussed security matters largely involving Russia, along with economic concerns and historical issues, according to the Kyiv Independent.\n\nZelensky said the meeting was the start of a new chapter for the relationship between the two nations and is \"bad news for Russia.\"\n\n\"I very much hope that this visit opens a new and even more substantial chapter in our relations -- the relations between Ukraine and Poland, the relations not merely of neighbors, but of two European pillars without which there will simply be no freedom in our part of Europe, because there will be no security,\" Zelensky told media afterward during a joint press conference.\n\n\"Russia wants discord, wants to destroy and dismantle such a strong alliance -- the alliance of two peoples of many generations of Ukraine and Poland,\" Zelensky said. \"We will not allow them to do this.\"\n\nHe said Ukrainian and Polish independence deters Russian aggression in Eastern Europe but warned that Russia would continue into Poland if Ukraine were to fall amid the nearly four-year war there that began when Russia invaded on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nNawrocki said Poland has supported Ukraine during the war and might exchange MiG-29 fighters in return for Ukrainian drone technology.\n\nPoland's president has criticized Ukraine's desire to join the European Union and NATO, both of which Poland is a member state.\n\nThe two presidents also discussed the Volyn massacres of 1943-1944, during which Ukrainian Insurgent Army members killed tens of thousands of Poles in Nazi-occupied territory in western Ukraine.\n\nRetaliatory attacks caused the deaths of thousands of Ukrainians, and the historical conflict remains a source of tension between Polish and Ukrainian leaders.\n\nThe meeting between the two presidents followed Zelensky's trip to Belgium, where he met with European Union leaders in Brussels and secured a $105.5 billion, interest-free loan for Ukraine.\n\nThe loan is in place of allocating funds to Ukraine from frozen Russian assets, which EU leaders considered but declined after failing to reach a consensus.\n\nZelensky said the loaned money will either help fund Ukraine's defense against Russia or support rebuilding the nation if Russia agrees to a peace deal and ends its aggression, The Independent reported.",

    "fullText": "Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing for his annual televised Q&A session, and a new poll shows Russians remain focused on two issues: the war and the economy.\n\nAccording to a poll of 1,608 Russians conducted by the independent Levada Center, the top two concerns Russians want to raise with Putin are when the war will end and how they're supposed to cope with a deteriorating economy.\n\nAbout a fifth of respondents said they would ask Putin when the war in Ukraine, which the Kremlin calls a \"special military operation,\" would end.\n\nRight behind the war is the economy, as another 16% say their top question is about living standards — salaries, pensions, and benefits.\n\nThese two concerns have topped Levada's polls ahead of Putin's annual Q&A for three years.\n\nBeyond the top concerns, Levada found that 8% of respondents want to ask Putin about price growth and tax hikes, 6% about utilities and social services, and 5% about the healthcare system.\n\nThe anxiety comes as Russia's inflation remains high, and the country's massive defense spending jostles with social spending.\n\nPutin's televised \"Direct Line\" Q&A session, scheduled for Friday, comes nearly four years after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, triggering sweeping Western sanctions.\n\nSince the invasion in February 2022, the Kremlin has steered the country onto a wartime economic footing.\n\nHeavy defense spending and state-directed investment have helped sustain headline economic growth, even as sanctions and export restrictions have reshaped trade flows.\n\nBut strains are showing: Energy export revenues have dropped in a softer oil-price environment, while high inflation continues to sap consumer demand.\n\nPrevious hourslong \"Direct Line\" broadcasts offer a preview of how Putin may handle the questions the Kremlin allows.\n\nLast year, Putin acknowledged that Russia's economy was overheating amid high inflation and warned citizens to brace for continued pressure.\n\nHowever, he deflected blame, suggesting that both the central bank and the Russian federal government — formally headed by the prime minister — could have acted more decisively to prevent the surge in prices and credit growth.\n\nPutin is also expected to hold an end-of-year news conference on Friday, where the spotlight will be on any signals he offers about the direction of the war.",

    "description": "In the last year, Ukraine's interceptors have gone from novel technology to being produced in the thousands every month.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's defense ministry said on Thursday that it has been supplying its troops with roughly 950 interceptor drones every day since the beginning of December.\n\nIn its statement, the ministry said these drones were specifically to \"counter enemy Shahed-type UAVs.\"\n\nReaching nearly 1,000 daily delivered interceptors is a significant milestone for the production of such drones, which were largely still in prototyping stages at the start of the year.\n\nThese interceptors are first-person-view drones designed to fly into and destroy enemy aerial systems, typically using explosives or direct impact. A typical interceptor drone flies with four motor-powered propellers, but unlike the usual quadcopters, it is often shaped like a bullet or a rocket.\n\nInitially built to destroy high-flying reconnaissance craft, they've since been evolved by Ukrainians to take down long-range attack drones at a low cost — primarily as a response to Russia launching large waves of Iranian-designed Shaheds this year.\n\n\"These systems strengthen protection against drone terror while preserving resources for intercepting cruise and ballistic missiles,\" Ukraine's defense minister, Denys Shmyhal, said in Thursday's announcement.\n\nThe defense ministry also said it's been working with more than 10 interceptor manufacturers and has placed more orders for next year.\n\nFor Ukraine, interceptors must be fast enough to chase down drones such as the Shahed-136, which flies at a typical speed of 115 mph, while remaining cheap so that Kyiv's troops can sustainably use hundreds of them a day. Russia has recently been attacking with roughly 5,500 Shahed-type drones a month.\n\nSome Ukrainian drone makers have also been attempting to develop interceptors that can catch the Geran-3, the Russian version of the jet-powered Shahed-238, which can reportedly fly at an estimated 230 mph.\n\nUkraine's new production capacity comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in November that his country was producing roughly 600 to 800 interceptors a day, falling short of his initial goal.\n\nIn July, Zelenskyy had set a production target of 1,000 interceptors a day.\n\nUkraine's volunteer movements directly sponsor some interceptor drones for select military units, though their quantity is often limited compared to the scale of what the Ukrainian government provides.\n\nFor example, deliveries of the Wild Hornets' Sting, a $2,500 interceptor, were mostly sponsored this year by the Sternenko Foundation, a local crowdfunding organization.",

    "description": "Russia disclosed several new figures on Wednesday, including how much it's specifically spent on the war and how many soldiers it hired in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Russia's defense ministry broadcast its wide-ranging annual review on Wednesday of the Ukraine war, providing clues about its military goals and performance this year.\n\nAndrei Belousov, the Russian defense minister, presented the official statistics during the Defense Ministry Board's expanded meeting in Moscow.\n\nBusiness Insider could not independently verify the defense ministry's claims, which often differ significantly from those of international observers. Russia's leader, Vladimir Putin, said at the meeting that the Kremlin's troops were \"crushing\" Ukraine, despite the war dragging on for nearly four years.\n\nThe disclosures also come as Russia has sought to project strength and demanded heavy concessions from Ukraine while negotiating potential peace terms with the Trump administration.\n\nHowever, Belousov's presentation offers insight into Russia's ambitions for the war and its official narratives surrounding how it fights and plans to fight next year. Several new official figures were also announced.\n\nHere are 10 highlights from Belousov's end-of-year review.\n\nBelousov said that Russia's war spending is on track to reach about 5.1% of the country's GDP in 2025, out of an overall defense budget that reaches 7.3% of its annual GDP.\n\nThe country's nominal GDP in 2024 was about 201.2 trillion rubles, and is expected to grow 1% this year to about 203 trillion rubles, or $2.52 trillion.\n\nRussian independent media, however, reported that the economic ministry has forecast a GDP of about $2.7 trillion for the year.\n\nA war budget of 5.1% would therefore be somewhere between $128 billion and $137.7 billion.\n\nThis is the first time Russia has publicly disclosed the amount that it spends specifically on the war. Previously, the Kremlin only announced figures for total defense spending.\n\nThe US, by comparison, is planning to spend $901 billion on its military, or about 3.4% of its GDP.\n\nBelousov said that his ministry delivered roughly 38,000 motorcycles, buggies, and all-terrain vehicles to its troops on the front lines in 2025.\n\n\"This is 10 times more than last year,\" he said, adding that Russia plans to reach \"full strength\" in these vehicles next year.\n\nRussian troops have increasingly been using motorcycles, quad bikes, and other small, unarmored vehicles to assault or approach Ukrainian positions, trying to use their speed and small size to avoid drone attacks.\n\nUkrainians have also adopted the tactic, with one regiment even establishing an official motorcycle attack company in May.\n\nBelousov said that Russia hired 409,611 new contract soldiers in 2025, down from 449,243 in 2024.\n\nHowever, that already exceeds the Kremlin's 403,000 person recruitment goal for the year.\n\n\"Nearly two-thirds of them were young men under 40,\" Belousov said of the new recruits. \"More than a third have higher or specialized secondary education.\"\n\nUkraine and Russia have both been hard-pressed to fill their ranks as Moscow pressures Kyiv's forces with a continuous grind of frontal infantry assaults.\n\nTo maintain its flow of troops, Russia often entices recruits with hefty sign-on bonuses or pardons for crimes committed in the country.\n\nBelousov said that about 50% of Ukrainian casualties from Russian attacks come from first-person-view drones, or FPV drones. These are the small quadcopters mounted with explosives that have become a hallmark of the war.\n\nIn the summer, Russia said that it was outproducing Ukraine on FPV drones, though Kyiv's officials have since said their country has caught back up.\n\nUkrainian leaders have said that 70% of all casualties inflicted during the war involved FPV drones.\n\nBelousov said that Russia plans to create a new drone formation called the Unmanned Systems Forces next year, which would train \"tens of thousands\" of people.\n\nRussia has already created an official drone unit called Rubicon, which was formed last August to prioritize fighting with FPV drones and has often been described as fielding its most elite pilots.\n\nNow, Moscow appears to be trying to make such warfare an official pillar of its fighting force.\n\nBelousov said the Kremlin needed to transition FPV drone attacks from individual tasks carried out by each unit to \"integrated joint operations\" among its forces.\n\nUkraine launched its own Unmanned Systems Forces last year, appointing the previous commander of the elite unit, Magyar Birds, as its leader.\n\nRoughly 27,400 Ukrainian long-range drones were intercepted this year over Russian territory, with the bulk appearing after the summer, Belousov said.\n\nBelousov said that Ukraine initially began sending about 1,000 drones a month into Russia, but that the monthly number began hitting 3,700 by May.\n\nThe defense minister claimed that Russia's interception rate \"averages 97%\" for the year.\n\nUkraine has typically used fixed-wing drones to attack deeper into Russia, targeting what it says are oil and gas facilities and military production sites.\n\nUkrainian kamikaze \"drones\" aka converted Ukrainian-produced Aeroprakt A-22 Foxbat light aircraft.\n\nThese drones can reportedly deliver 300kg warheads at a range around 2000 - 3000 km.\n\nIt's believed that similar drones were recently used to hit a Shahed drone manufacturing… pic.twitter.com/8xw6BzoZvO\n\nNotably, Belousov mentioned that Russia has also been exploring FPV drones that can serve as high-speed interceptors, a technology that Ukraine has been refining to counter Moscow's Shahed waves.\n\nBelousov said that Russia received two Tu-160Ms, which are modernized, supersonic bombers that can deploy nuclear weapons or powerful stealth missiles.\n\nThat's a clue about the production rate of the bombers, which are part of a small fleet that forms a vital pillar of Russia's nuclear triad. Several of Russia's older bombers were reported severely damaged in Operation Spiderweb, an audacious Ukrainian drone attack in early June that targeted a fleet of about 41 warplanes.\n\nUkrainian sources claimed that several Tu-160s were also hit, although this was not confirmed by independent open-source intelligence at the time.\n\nRussia's military also appears to be modifying its organizational structure.\n\nBelousov said that the Kremlin had created five new divisions, 13 new brigades, and 30 new regiments in 2025. International think tanks estimate that Russian divisions can consist of between 10,000 and 20,000 troops, while regiments within typically have about 2,000 soldiers and are further split into battalions.\n\nBrigades, which typically exist as a separate formation, often have about 3,500 to 4,500 troops.\n\nBelousov said this new structure included a new division, called the Aerospace Forces, which has a regiment \"equipped with the unique S-500 antiaircraft missile system, capable of striking targets in near space.\"\n\nNext year, the Kremlin plans to add four more divisions, 14 brigades, and 39 new regiments, he added.\n\nSome of these figures encompass formations that Russia has transformed, so they aren't necessarily an indicator of how widely Russia is expanding its military organization structure. For example, Belousov said two marine brigades were turned into a single division.\n\nBelousov said that Russia had expanded its use of drones and all-terrain vehicles to deliver gear from a \"one-time operation\" in 2024 to carrying 12,000 tons of cargo this year to the front lines.\n\n\"By 2026, this figure must be at least doubled,\" he said.\n\nBoth Ukraine and Russia have been developing uncrewed ground vehicles, or ground-based drones, that can be remotely operated to deliver supplies to the front line or even conduct assaults.\n\nThe emerging technology is especially useful for dangerous tasks that would otherwise have to be filled by a human soldier.\n\nSome military units have also reported using drones to deliver equipment by air, such as one Ukrainian commander who said his forces used drones to send an e-bike to a stranded soldier.\n\nBelousov's presentation made it clear that Russia has been conducting precision strikes against Ukraine's power facilities.\n\nMore than 70% of Ukraine's thermal power plants and 37% of its hydroelectric plants have been disabled, Belousov said.\n\n\"The effectiveness of Russian precision strikes is about 60%, which is an order of magnitude higher than the effectiveness of Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory,\" Belousov said.\n\n\"Ukraine's energy capacity has been reduced by more than half,\" he added.\n\nAttacking energy infrastructure is a war crime if it's found to be intentionally carried out to cause harm to civilians. Ukraine's besieged power grid is especially crucial, as it's essential for keeping its citizens warm during harsh winters.\n\nBelousov said the strikes on energy facilities were targeting the Ukrainian military, and that disabling the grid cut off power to Kyiv's forces.\n\nHowever, the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said last September that Russian attacks on Ukraine's power grid were found to be severely affecting civilians and had \"disproportionately impacted\" vulnerable groups.\n\nUkraine also carries out attacks on Russian oil and gas facilities, though it said its aim is to cripple Moscow's ability to export energy and sustain war production.",

    "fullText": "In November, a train carrying almost 500 people came to a sudden halt in eastern Poland. A broken overhead line had smashed several windows, and the track ahead was damaged. Elsewhere on the line, explosives detonated under a passing freight train.\n\nNo one was hurt in either case and the damage was limited, but Poland, which blamed the attack on Russia’s intelligence services, responded forcefully: It deployed 10,000 troops to protect critical infrastructure.\n\nThe sabotage in Poland is one of 145 incidents in an Associated Press database that Western officials say are part of a campaign of disruption across Europe masterminded by Russia. Officials say the campaign — waged since President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 — aims to deprive Kyiv of support, create divisions among Europeans and identify the continent's security weak spots.\n\nSo far in this hybrid war, most known acts of sabotage have resulted in minimal damage — nothing compared to the tens of thousands of lives lost and cities decimated across Ukraine.\n\nBut officials say each act — from vandalism of monuments to cyberattacks to warehouse fires — sucks up valuable security resources. The head of one large European intelligence service said investigations into Russian interference now swallow up as much of the agency’s time as terrorism.\n\nWhile the campaign places a heavy burden on European security services, it costs Russia next to nothing, officials say. That’s because Moscow is carrying out cross-border operations that require European countries to cooperate extensively on investigations — while often using foreigners with criminal backgrounds as cheap proxies for Russian intelligence operatives. That means Moscow notches up a win just by tying up resources — even when plots aren’t successful.\n\n“It’s a 24/7 operation between all the services to stop it,” said a senior European intelligence official, who like the head of the European intelligence service and other officials who spoke to AP insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive security matters.\n\nOver the course of the year, AP spoke to more than 40 European and NATO officials from 13 countries to document the scope of this hybrid war, including incidents on its map only when linked by Western officials to Russia, its proxies or its ally Belarus.\n\nPutin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told AP that Russia doesn't have “any connection” with the campaign.\n\nAP’s map tracking Russian sabotage and disruption\n\nAP’s database shows a spike in arson and explosives plots from one in 2023 to 26 in 2024. Six have been documented so far in 2025. Three vandalism cases were recorded last year, meanwhile, and one this year.\n\nThe data is incomplete since not all incidents are made public, and it can take officials months to establish a link to Moscow. But the spike matches what officials have warned: The campaign is growing more dangerous.\n\nThe countries most frequently targeted, according to the map, border Russia: Poland and Estonia. Several incidents have also occurred in Latvia, the U.K., Germany and France. All are major supporters of Ukraine.\n\nThe European official, a senior Baltic intelligence official and another intelligence official said the campaign noticeably calmed in late 2024 and early this year. Their analysis showed Moscow likely paused the campaign to curry favor with U.S. President Donald Trump's new administration. It has since resumed at full pace.\n\n“They are back to business,” the European official said.\n\nMulticountry plots drain resources\n\nThe man officials say was behind the attack on the Polish railway that carries supplies to Ukraine is Yevgeny Ivanov — a Ukrainian convicted of working with Russian military intelligence to plot arson attacks at home improvement stores, a cafe and a drone factory in Ukraine, according to court documents.\n\nIvanov, who left Poland after the attack there, worked for Yury Sizov, an officer from Russia's GRU military intelligence service, according to Ukraine’s security service.\n\nIvanov was convicted in absentia in Ukraine but managed to enter Poland because Ukraine did not inform Polish officials of his conviction, Polish Interior Minister Marcin Kierwiński said. Ukraine’s security service said it closely cooperates with allies.\n\nStaging plots that involve perpetrators from several countries or who have crossed borders drains investigatory resources from multiple authorities across Europe — one of Moscow’s key goals, according to Estonian State Prosecutor Triinu Olev-Aas.\n\nOver the last year, she said the profile of attackers in Estonia has changed from locals largely known to law enforcement to unknown foreigners. That requires increased cooperation among countries to disrupt plots or detain perpetrators.\n\nFor two attacks in January — fires set at a supermarket and a Ukrainian restaurant — the people hired had never been to Estonia before, Olev-Aas said.\n\nAt the restaurant, a Moldovan man smashed a window, threw in a can of gasoline and set it alight. Video showed his arm on fire as he ran away.\n\nThe man and his accomplice fled through Latvia, Lithuania and Poland before being caught in Italy.\n\nWhile Russian intelligence officers might be the masterminds of such operations, they frequently rely on recruiters — often with convictions or criminal connections — who assign tasks to saboteurs on the ground, the Baltic official said.\n\nOutsourcing to people with criminal backgrounds, like Ivanov, means Russia doesn’t have to risk highly trained intelligence operatives — agents Moscow often doesn’t have recourse to anyway since European countries kicked out scores of spies as relations nosedived in recent years.\n\nRussian criminal networks offer a ready-made alternative, the Baltic official said.\n\nThe European official said the man accused of coordinating a plot to put explosives in packages on cargo planes, for example, was recruited by Russian intelligence after involvement with smuggling guns and explosives. The man is linked to at leastfour other plots.\n\nOther people are recruited from European prisons or soon after they're released, the Baltic official said.\n\nIn one case, the Museum of the Occupation of Latvia, dedicated to the Soviet Union’s occupation of the country, was set on fire by someone released from prison the previous month.\n\nGreater strain, greater cooperation\n\nEven plots that are foiled are a win for Moscow because they test defenses and waste resources.\n\nIn 2024, a Ukrainian man, working on the orders of Russian military intelligence, dug up a cache of items buried in a cemetery in Lithuania, including drone parts and cans of corn filled with explosives.\n\nOfficials believe the plan was to rig the drones with the explosives. The plot was eventually foiled — but not before considerable resources were used to track down everyone involved, said Jacek Dobrzyński, the spokesperson for Poland’s security minister.\n\nThe sheer number of plots is overstretching some law enforcement agencies, but Moscow’s campaign has also fostered greater cooperation, the European official said.\n\nProsecutors in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia have created joint investigation teams for attacks organized by foreign intelligence services, said Mārtiņš Jansons, a special prosecutor in Latvia.\n\nIn the U.K., front-line police officers are being trained to spot suspicious incidents that may be state-backed, said Cmdr. Dominic Murphy, head of the counterterrorism squad at the Metropolitan Police.\n\nHe noted a trainee detective flagged an arson attack at a warehouse in London after realizing the business was owned by Ukrainians and contained communications devices used by the military. Police determined the attack was organized by Russian intelligence.\n\nBut officials warn Russia is continually testing new methods.\n\nSmugglers in Russia’s ally Belarus have sent hundreds of weather balloons carrying cigarettes into Lithuania and Poland, repeatedly forcing the Lithuanian capital’s airport to shut in what authorities called a hybrid attack.\n\n“Nowadays they only carry cigarettes,\" Dobrzyński warned, \"but in future they could carry other things.\"",

    "fullText": "Russian state TV host Vladimir Solovyov added to fears that a larger war will break out in Europe when he took to the airwaves on Tuesday and listed multiple countries Russia should “destroy” and “liberate.”\n\n“Once again, we will have to destroy Berlin, and enter this godforsaken city,” Solovyov said. “Once again, we will have to enter Paris. Once again, we will have to liberate Vienna. Well, perhaps the Austrians will reconsider. It doesn’t mean that we want this. But one of the principles postulated by our supreme commander-in-chief is when we are forced to act, then we act.”\n\nSolovyov’s rant followed him as he traveled to the Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk for a propaganda hit last week. Russian President Vladimir Putin has so far been unable to capture the city in its years-long conflict with Ukraine.\n\nSolovyov’s rant also dropped as concerns are growing about Russia possibly targeting another country on top of their invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto cautioned this week that tensions are escalating with Russia and Europe would not survive a war.\n\n“Freezing Russian assets was already a serious step, but using those assets goes even further. This is a war provocation of an unprecedented scale,” he said about the EU using frozen Russian assets. “Therefore, at today’s Foreign Affairs Council, I will make it clear that for Hungary, the risk of further escalation is unacceptable. Simply because if a war were to break out between Europe and Russia, Europe would not survive it.”\n\nBrussels wants to send another €210 billion to Ukraine, including around €115 billion for weapons.\n\nThe EU is disregarding its own rules by planning to finance this package through frozen Russian assets. This move would raise the risk of escalation to a level not seen in the… pic.twitter.com/DGrBBZ9a5F\n\n— Péter Szijjártó (@FM_Szijjarto) December 15, 2025\n\nBritish Chief of the Defense Staff Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Knighton also warned people to be ready for a potential war with Russia. Mark Rutte, secretary general of the NATO alliance, made a similar warning.\n\n“The shadow of war is knocking on Europe’s door and that war could be bigger and bloodier than what we have experienced in recent times,” Rutte said.\n\nSolovyov has gone on fiery, scorched-Earth rants in the past, openly fantasizing in July about a nuclear attack on the United States.\n\n“It doesn’t mean that we want this. But one of the principles postulated by our supreme commander-in-chief is when we are forced to act then we act. First, of course, the principle of ‘do no harm’ but then…please don’t blame us,” Solovyov said on Tuesday.\n\nWhile speaking in Moscow this week, Putin denied Russian plans to invade Europe, dismissing warnings to prepare for potential war as “hysteria.”\n\nThe post Putin Ally Names European Countries Russia Will ‘Destroy’ as World War III Fears Loom first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Newly captured satellite imagery shows the aftermath of a Ukrainian drone attack that targeted a Russian submarine at a naval base on the Black Sea.\n\nThe new imagery, captured on Tuesday by the US spatial intelligence firm Vantor and obtained by Business Insider, shows damage to a section of a quay at the port of Novorossiysk next to a Kilo-class submarine.\n\nUkraine's internal security agency said on Monday that it used underwater drones to strike a Russian submarine at the port in a first-of-its-kind attack. Kyiv published footage of the operation, which caused a large blast in the port, and said it damaged and disabled the boat.\n\nRussian state media, citing the Black Sea Fleet, said later on Monday that the attack failed to damage a submarine.\n\nThe satellite imagery does not appear to reveal any visible damage to a submarine; however, there could be some beneath the surface, making it difficult to determine the success of the operation.\n\nRussia's Kilo-class submarines — diesel-electric boats that have been in service since the 1980s — are used to carry out Kalibr cruise missile strikes against Ukraine, making them a high-value target for Kyiv.\n\nThe new imagery also reveals floating barriers at the entrance of the port, a tactic that Russia has used to protect its warships and infrastructure from Ukrainian naval drone attacks. However, this kind of defense is primarily aimed at surface threats, as the underwater drone was still able to enter the port and cause an explosion.\n\nUkraine has used its fleet of explosive-packed naval drones and long-range missiles to damage and destroy dozens of Russian warships and vessels since the start of the full-scale invasion.\n\nThis asymmetric campaign has forced Russia to relocate its Black Sea Fleet away from its long-held headquarters in the occupied Crimean peninsula to Novorossiysk, on the other side of the region. However, Ukraine continues to demonstrate that it can also target this port.\n\nThe attack, the latest against the Black Sea Fleet, appears to signal a new chapter in drone warfare. Ukraine has mainly relied on surface naval drones to target Russian warships.\n\nThe use of an underwater drone, compared to a slow-moving mine or torpedo, suggests a significant expansion of Ukraine's capabilities that could pose a new threat to the Black Sea Fleet.\n\nConflict analysts at the Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank, wrote in a battlefield assessment on Monday that Russia had docked its Kilo-class submarines in Crimea but moved them to Novorossiysk several years ago because of Ukraine's strike campaign.\n\nThe recent underwater drone attack \"shows that Ukrainian forces continue to modernize and optimize their unmanned capabilities such that Ukraine can strike Russian military targets at a range that Russian forces previously thought safe,\" the analysts said.",

A statement said they own or manage shadow fleet tankers under sanctions and which transport oil “while practicing irregular and high-risk shipping practices.”\n\nThe sanctions, which were agreed at a meeting of the 27-nation bloc's foreign ministers in Brussels, involve mostly asset freezes and travel bans.\n\nThe EU move adds to growing pressure on the shadow fleet. Last month, Ukraine used domestically produced Sea Baby naval drones to strike two more Russian oil tankers in the Black Sea. Both were under international sanctions.\n\nSeparately, the bloc imposed sanctions on members of Russia’s military intelligence agency, GRU, and a hacking group known as Cadet Blizzard, accusing them of cyber attacks targeting Ukraine, the EU and unnamed NATO allies.\n\nThe EU also added a number of foreign policy analysts and influencers accused of promoting pro-Russian propaganda or conspiracy theories to its sanctions list.",

One proposal is to use some of the tens of billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets held in Europe.\n\n“The aggressor must pay,” Zelenskyy told the Dutch parliament earlier Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, he attended peace talks in Berlin with U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Zelenskyy voiced readiness to drop his country’s bid to join NATO in exchange for Western security guarantees, but rejected the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia.\n\n“These security guarantees are an opportunity to prevent another wave of Russian aggression,” he told journalists. “And this is already a compromise on our part.”\n\nThirty-five countries backed the International Claims Commission, but they now must ratify the treaty, a process which usually requires legislature approval. That level of support is unprecedented for the start of a Council of Europe treaty.\n\nThe commission will assess claims made to the already operational register of damages, which was launched during a Council of Europe summit in 2023. Some 80,000 claims have already been filed with the register, which is based in The Hague.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told a press conference the bloc would give one million euros ($1.1 million) to finance the commission's operation. An estimated 3.5 million euros ($4.1 million) are needed overall.\n\nMany of the same countries have also backed a new international court, also under the umbrella of the Council of Europe, to prosecute senior Russian officials for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",

They want to get it ended, also.\"\n\nThe U.S. officials said the offer of security guarantees won’t be on the table “forever.” They said the Trump administration plans to put forward the agreement on guarantees for Senate approval, although they didn’t specify whether it would be ratified like a treaty, which needs the chamber's two-thirds approval.\n\nIn a statement, European leaders in Berlin said they and the U.S. committed to work together to provide “robust security guarantees,” including a European-led ”multinational force Ukraine\" supported by the U.S.\n\nThey said the force's work would include \"operating inside Ukraine\" as well as assisting in rebuilding Ukraine's forces, securing its skies and supporting safer seas. They said Ukrainian forces should remain at a peacetime level of 800,000.\n\nWitkoff and Kushner were accompanied by U.S. Air Force Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, who heads NATO's military operations and the U.S. European Command, as talks honed in on the particulars of what the U.S. officials described as an “Article 5-like” security agreement. Article Five in the NATO treaty is the collective defense clause stating that an attack on one member is an attack on all.\n\nThe U.S. side presented the Ukrainians a document that spelled out in greater specificity aspects of the proposed U.S. security guarantees — something that Ukrainian officials said was missing from earlier iterations of the U.S. peace proposal, according to U.S. officials.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz called it a “truly far-reaching, substantial agreement that we did not have before, namely that both Europe and the U.S. are jointly prepared to do this.”\n\nQuestions over Ukraine's postwar security and the fate of occupied territories have been the main obstacles in talks. Zelenskyy has emphasized that any Western security assurances would need to be legally binding and supported by the U.S. Congress. Meanwhile, Russia has said it will not accept any troops from NATO countries being based on Ukrainian soil.\n\nZelenskyy on Monday called the talks “substantial” and noted that differences remain on the issue of territory.\n\nZelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine’s bid to join NATO if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to NATO members. But Ukraine’s preference remains NATO membership as the best security guarantee to prevent further Russian aggression.\n\nUkraine has continued to reject the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw its forces from the part of the Donetsk region still under its control as a key condition for peace.\n\nThe U.S. officials on Monday said there is consensus on about 90% of the U.S.-authored peace plan, and that Russia has indicated it is open to Ukraine joining the European Union, something it previously said it did not object to.\n\nThe Russian president has cast Ukraine’s bid to join NATO, however, as a major threat to Moscow’s security and a reason for launching the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The Kremlin has demanded that Ukraine renounce the bid for alliance membership as part of any prospective peace settlement.\n\nAsked whether the negotiations could be over by Christmas, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said trying to predict a potential time frame for a peace deal was a “thankless task.”\n\n“I can only speak for the Russian side, for President Putin,” Peskov said. “He is open to peace, to a serious peace and serious decisions. He is absolutely not open to any tricks aimed at stalling for time.”\n\nPutin has denied plans to attack any European allies.\n\nRussia fired 153 drones of various types at Ukraine overnight Sunday into Monday, according to Ukraine’s Air Force, which said 133 drones were neutralized, while 17 more hit their targets.\n\nIn Russia, the Defense Ministry on Monday said forces destroyed 130 Ukrainian drones overnight. An additional 16 drones were destroyed between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. local time.\n\nEighteen drones were shot down over Moscow itself, the defense ministry said. Flights were temporarily halted at the city’s Domodedovo and Zhukovsky airports as part of safety measures, officials said.\n\nDamage details and casualty figures were not immediately available.\n\nMadhani reported from Washington.

    "description": "Russia is now arming its drones with Soviet-era air-to-air missiles to hunt Ukrainian aircraft, Kyiv said.",
    "fullText": "A new kind of Russian drone armed with an air-to-air missile is being made using foreign parts, including some sourced from Western countries, Ukraine's military intelligence agency revealed on Monday.\n\nThe drone — a modified Geran-2 — was recently spotted in Ukraine carrying a Soviet-era missile, a first for this war. From the Ukrainian assessment, it's the latest Russian weapon to turn up with foreign components despite the sweeping international sanctions and export controls targeting Moscow.\n\nUkraine's military intelligence agency, the GUR, said that Russia has armed its Geran-2 drones with R-60 air-to-air missiles to fire at helicopters and aircraft providing air defense for Kyiv. Officials and analysts have delivered similar determinations about the purpose of the modification.\n\n\"The main purpose of the new development is to create a threat to Ukrainian military and tactical aviation, reducing the effectiveness of its work in intercepting enemy UAVs,\" the GUR wrote in a translated statement.\n\nThe GUR said that the modified drone contains foreign-made parts produced by companies in the US, UK, Germany, Switzerland, China, Japan, and Taiwan. Kyiv has frequently identified components in Russian weaponry sourced from these countries, some of which are among Ukraine's closest partners.\n\nRussia's defense ministry and its US embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the foreign parts assessments.\n\nDespite global sanctions, Western technology can still find its way into Russian weaponry via civilian markets, middlemen, or countries that sidestep export rules. Ukraine has repeatedly urged the international community to close those gaps and further isolate the Kremlin.\n\nIn one attack this fall, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that more than 100,000 foreign-made parts were discovered among 550 drones and missiles that Russia launched, underscoring just how massive the problem continues to be for Kyiv.\n\nRussia's introduction of a new Geran-2 — a one-way attack drone based on the Iranian Shahed-136 — armed with an air-to-air missile is notable, though it is not the first time in this war that drones have received these types of modifications.\n\nUkraine, for instance, has armed some of its naval drones with surface-to-air missiles, which have been used to shoot down Russian aircraft flying combat air patrols over the Black Sea.\n\nThe Shahed-style Geran-2 usually carries an internal warhead that explodes when the drone impacts a target. The R-60 missile — which entered service for Soviet fighter jets in the early 1970s and has a 6-mile range — may force Russia to limit the size of the payload, potentially reducing the drone's effectiveness in exchange for increased survivability.\n\nThe GUR said that the missile could be used if Russian operators saw a nearby Ukrainian aircraft or helicopters through cameras mounted on the drone and then ordered a launch. The R-60 features heat-seeking technology that enables it to home in on its target.\n\nThe new missile-armed Geran-2 comes as Russia continues to invest heavily in drone operations, including domestic production and the development of new launch sites.",

The photographs showed about 25 people standing in a circle in the snow, holding up ​placards.\n\nIn Russia, the ban on Roblox has triggered a debate over censorship, child safety in ‌relation to technology and even the effectiveness of censorship in a digitalised world where children can bypass many bans in a few clicks.\n\nMany Russians simply circumvent bans by using VPNs (Virtual Private Networks), though some young Russians have questioned the logic of a ban if it can be so easily bypassed while others have questioned why there are so few Russian alternatives to the ⁠apps which the state has banned.\n\nSome Russian parents and ​teachers have said they were concerned Roblox allowed children ​to access sexual content and communicate with adults.\n\nRoblox, headquartered in San Mateo, California, has been banned by several countries including Iraq and Turkey over concerns about ‍predators exploiting the platform ⁠to abuse children.\n\nThe company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. When the Russian ban was introduced, Roblox said it has \"a deep commitment to safety\" and provides \"rigorous ⁠built-in protections to help keep users safe\".\n\nRussian officials say they need censorship to defend against a sophisticated \"information war\" unleashed ‌by Western powers, and what they cast as decadent Western culture which undermines \"traditional\" ‌Russian values.",

    "fullText": "BERLIN (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday voiced readiness to drop his country’s bid to join NATO in exchange for Western security guarantees, but rejected the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia as he held talks with U.S. envoys on ending the war.\n\nZelenskyy sat down with U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. The Ukrainian leader posted pictures of the negotiating table with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz sitting next to him facing the U.S. delegation.\n\nResponding to journalists’ questions in audio clips on a WhatsApp group chat before the talks, Zelenskyy said that since the U.S. and some European nations had rejected Ukraine’s push to join NATO, Kyiv expects the West to offer a set of guarantees similar to those offered to the alliance members.\n\n“These security guarantees are an opportunity to prevent another wave of Russian aggression,” he said. “And this is already a compromise on our part.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has cast Ukraine's bid to join NATO as a major threat to Moscow's security and a reason for launching the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The Kremlin has demanded tha Ukraine renounce the bid for the alliance membership as part of any prospective peace settlement.\n\nZelenskyy emphasized that any security assurances would need to be legally binding and supported by the U.S. Congress, adding that he expected an update from his team following a meeting between Ukrainian and U.S. military officials in Stuttgart, Germany.\n\nWashington has tried for months to navigate the demands of each side as Trump presses for a swift end to Russia’s war and grows increasingly exasperated by delays. The search for possible compromises has run into major obstacles, including control of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, which is mostly occupied by Russian forces.\n\nPutin wants Ukraine to withdraw its forces from the part of the Donetsk region still under its control among the key conditions for peace, a demand rejected by Kyiv.\n\nZelenskyy said that the U.S. had floated an idea for Ukraine to withdraw from the Donetsk and create a demilitarized free economic zone there, a proposal he rejected as unworkable.\n\n“I do not consider this fair, because who will manage this economic zone?” he said. “If we are talking about some buffer zone along the line of contact, if we are talking about some economic zone and we believe that only a police mission should be there and troops should withdraw, then the question is very simple. If Ukrainian troops withdraw 5–10 kilometers, for example, then why do Russian troops not withdraw deeper into the occupied territories by the same distance?”\n\nZelenskyy described the issue as “very sensitive” and insisted on a freeze along the line of contact, saying that “today a fair possible option is we stand where we stand.”\n\nPutin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov told the business daily Kommersant that Russian police and national guard would stay in parts of the Donetsk region even if they become a demilitarized zone under a prospective peace plan.\n\nUshakov warned that a search for compromise could take a long time, noting that the U.S. proposals that took into account Russian demands had been “worsened” by alterations proposed by Ukraine and its European allies.\n\nSpeaking to Russian state TV in remarks broadcast Sunday, Ushakov said that “the contribution of Ukrainians and Europeans to these documents is unlikely to be constructive,\" warning that Moscow will “have very strong objections.”\n\nUshakov added that the territorial issue was actively discussed in Moscow when Witkoff and Kushner met with Putin earlier this month. “The Americans know and understand our position,\" he said.\n\nZelenskyy said he spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday just before the talks with Trump’s envoys, thanking him on X for his support and adding that “we are coordinating closely and working together for the sake of our shared security.”\n\nMacron vowed on X that “France is, and will remain, at Ukraine’s side to build a robust and lasting peace — one that can guarantee Ukraine’s security and sovereignty, and that of Europe, over the long term.”\n\nMerz, who has spearheaded European efforts to support Ukraine alongside Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, said Saturday that “the decades of the ‘Pax Americana’ are largely over for us in Europe and for us in Germany as well.”\n\nHe warned that Putin's aim is “a fundamental change to the borders in Europe, the restoration of the old Soviet Union within its borders.”\n\n“If Ukraine falls, he won’t stop,” Merz warned on Saturday during a party conference in Munich.\n\nPutin has denied plans to restore the Soviet Union or attack any European allies.\n\nRussia and Ukraine exchange aerial attacks\n\nUkraine’s air force said that Russia overnight launched ballistic missiles and 138 attack drones at Ukraine. The air force said 110 had been intercepted or downed, but missile and drone hits were recorded at six locations.\n\nZelenskyy said Sunday that hundreds of thousands of families were still without power in the south, east and northeast regions and work was continuing to restore electricity, heat and water to multiple regions following a large-scale attack the previous night.\n\nThe Ukrainian president said that in the past week, Russia had launched over 1,500 strike drones, nearly 900 guided aerial bombs and 46 missiles of various types at Ukraine.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said that air defenses downed 235 Ukrainian drones late Saturday and early Sunday.\n\nIn the Belgorod region, a drone injured a man and set his house ablaze in the village of Yasnye Zori, regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nUkrainian drones struck an oil depot in Uryupinsk in the Volgograd region, triggering a fire, according to regional Gov. Andrei Bocharov.\n\nIn the Krasnodar region, the Ukrainian drones attacked the town of Afipsky, where an oil refinery is located. Authorities said that explosions shattered windows in residential buildings, but didn’t report any damage to the refinery.\n\nCiobanu reported from Warsaw, Poland.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "Ukraine's drone schools are preparing soldiers to take on Russia and working to keep pace with an ever-changing fight.",
    "fullText": "The Ukrainian drone schools training operators for war are having to rewrite their lessons as fast as every other week to get students ready for an ever-changing battlefield.\n\nWithin the drone battle, a critically important aspect of this war, tech and tactics are shifting rapidly. Three drone schools told Business Insider that it's imperative they keep their lessons up to date because it's life or death on the battlefield.\n\nTo maintain relevance and the tactical edge, the instructors are visiting the front regularly, keeping in touch with former students, and testing out new technology to shape their curriculum.\n\nTetyana, a Ukrainian veteran who goes by the call sign \"Ruda\" and is now the head of R&D for Dronarium, a drone training school with sites in Kyiv and Lviv, told Business Insider that changes sometimes take place every two weeks.\n\nAt the front, the evolution of technology is \"moving forward at a very fast pace.\" It means that \"also we have to be very fast in our adaptability.\"\n\nDmytro Slediuk, head of the education department at Dronarium, told BI that \"we continuously make changes to our training programs.\"\n\nFor the most part, he said, no two lectures on the same subject are exactly the same; something is always changing. Over 16,000 students have trained at the school. Their comments and experiences are reflected in the training program curriculum, Slediuk said. Instructors also visit the front lines, and service members come to the school, where they deliver insight into the latest in warfighting.\n\nThere are also group chats with soldiers, Tetyana said. It's two-way communication, with soldiers sharing front-line feedback and instructors providing guidance and advice.\n\nVitalii Pervak, CEO of another training school, Karlsson, Karas & Associates, said that it is absolutely vital that schools teach what is informed by and needed for the field.\n\n\"We do not teach things that will not be necessary in combat,\" he said. \"We constantly update our instructors' knowledge,\" occasionally with visits to the front to \"see firsthand what has changed, what remains relevant, and what can be discarded.\"\n\nViktor Taran, the CEO of the Kruk Drones UAV training center, told Business Insider that all students are in group chats with their instructors, and that connection is preserved after the training is complete. \"Cadets go to the front line, type questions in those chats, or provide information about new enemy tactics.\"\n\nNew information is added to the courses, with some topics updated every three months, he said.\n\nDrone strikes are responsible for most front-line hits and casualties, with both sides using them in lieu of traditional weaponry.\n\nThe result is constant modifications to how they are used and their tactics, as well as the drones themselves, with new types frequently entering the battlefield.\n\nLuke Pollard, the UK's armed forces minister, said this year that Western militaries risk becoming outdated. He said drone warfare is evolving so fast that \"we have to fundamentally challenge our assumptions.\"\n\nHe said that drone technology in Ukraine \"iterates every two to three weeks on the front line,\" while NATO militaries \"build and procure really expensive high-end bits of kit. And it will take you five, 10 years: five years to run a procurement challenge, another 10 years to build it.\" At that rate, the system may already be obsolete by the time it's ready for war.\n\nDefense companies watching Ukraine can see the speed of change, too, and are moving quickly to make changes. Matt McCrann, CEO of the US arm of Droneshield, a company making counter-drone systems for the US and Europe, recently told Business Insider that weapon development cycles are shifting from months and years to weeks.\n\nCompanies are regularly engaging in approaches similar to the drone schools — chats with soldiers and even front-line visits — to keep their understanding of warfighting demands up to date. Some companies have previously told BI that the ways Ukrainians are using tech have come as a surprise, so that communication and engagement are critical.\n\nGediminas Guoba, the CEO of Lithuanian company Granta Autonomy, which has drones in Ukraine, told Business Insider over the summer that he visits the battlefield himself \"just to understand how it really works\" and see what changes need to be made to its products to keep them relevant.\n\nAnd it's beneficial for soldiers too, sparking faster iteration. Ukrainian drone operators have told Business Insider that they keep in touch with companies making their drones to give them feedback on how they can be improved, as well as to get things like replacement parts.\n\nFrom the companies making drones to the troops using them to the schools training operators, everyone is rushing to maintain the edge, but the schools are not simply fighting to stay on top of changes. Targeted by Russian attacks and often seeking donations to help fund the training, they're fighting for survival as well.",

    "fullText": "COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — The United States is using its economic power to “assert its will\" and threaten military force against friend and foe alike, a Danish intelligence agency said in a new report.\n\nThe Danish Defense Intelligence Service, in its latest annual assessment, said Washington's greater assertiveness under the Trump administration also comes as China and Russia seek to diminish Western, especially American, influence.\n\nPerhaps most sensitive to Denmark — a NATO and European Union member country, and a U.S. ally — is growing competition between those great powers in the Arctic. U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed a desire to see Greenland, a semiautonomous and mineral-rich territory of Denmark, become part of the United States, a move opposed by Russia and much of Europe.\n\n“The strategic importance of the Arctic is rising as the conflict between Russia and the West intensifies, and the growing security and strategic focus on the Arctic by the United States will further accelerate these developments,” said the report, published Wednesday.\n\nThe assessment also follows the release last week of a new Trump administration national security strategy that depicts European allies as weak and aims to reassert America’s dominance in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said Russia is worried about NATO’s activities in the Arctic and will respond by strengthening its military capability in the polar region.\n\nThe findings and analyses in the report echo a string of recent concerns, notably in Western Europe, about an increasingly go-it-alone approach by the United States, which under Trump's second term has favored bilateral deals and partnerships at the expense of multilateral alliances like NATO.\n\n“For many countries outside the West, it has become a viable option to forge strategic agreements with China rather than the United States,” read the report, which was written in Danish. “China and Russia, together with other like-minded states, are seeking to reduce Western – and particularly US – global influence.”\n\n“At the same time, uncertainty has grown over how the United States will prioritize its resources in the future,” it added. “This gives regional powers greater room for maneuver, enabling them to choose between the United States and China or to strike a balance between the two.”\n\nThe Trump administration has raised concerns about respect for international law with its series of deadly strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean — part of a stepped-up pressure campaign against President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela.\n\nTrump has also refused to rule out military force in Greenland, where the United States already has a military base.\n\n“The United States is leveraging economic power, including threats of high tariffs, to assert its will, and the possibility of employing military force – even against allies – is no longer ruled out,” the report said.",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union on Friday indefinitely froze Russia’s assets in Europe to ensure that Hungary and Slovakia, both with Moscow-friendly governments, can’t prevent the billions of euros from being used to support Ukraine.\n\nUsing a special procedure meant for economic emergencies, the EU blocked the assets until Russia gives up its war on Ukraine and compensates its neighbor for the heavy damage that it has inflicted for almost four years.\n\nEU Council President António Costa said European leaders had committed in October “to keep Russian assets immobilized until Russia ends its war of aggression against Ukraine and compensates for the damage caused. Today we delivered on that commitment.”\n\nIt’s a key step that will allow EU leaders to work out at a summit next week how to use the tens of billions of euros in Russian Central Bank assets to underwrite a huge loan to help Ukraine meet its financial and military needs over the next two years.\n\n“Next step: securing Ukraine’s financial needs for 2026–27,” added Costa, who will chair the Dec. 18 summit.\n\nThe move also prevents the assets, estimated to total around 210 billion euros ($247 billion), from being used in any negotiations to end the war without European approval.\n\nA 28-point plan drafted by U.S. and Russian envoys stipulated that the EU would release the frozen assets for use by Ukraine, Russia and the United States. That plan, which surfaced last month, was rejected by Ukraine and its backers in Europe.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot wrote on X that the EU decision means that “no one will decide in place of the Europeans the use of these funds.”\n\nThe vast majority of the funds — around 193 billion euros ($225 billion) at the end of September — are held in Euroclear, a Belgian financial clearing house.\n\nThe money was frozen under sanctions that the EU imposed on Russia over the war it launched on Feb. 24, 2022, but these sanctions must be renewed every six months with the approval of all 27 member countries.\n\nHungary and Slovakia oppose providing more support to Ukraine, but Friday’s decision prevents them from blocking the sanctions rollover and make it easier to use the assets.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán – Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in Europe – said on social media that it means that “the rule of law in the European Union comes to an end, and Europe’s leaders are placing themselves above the rules.”\n\n“The European Commission is systematically raping European law. It is doing this in order to continue the war in Ukraine, a war that clearly isn’t winnable,” he wrote. He said that Hungary “will do everything in its power to restore a lawful order.”\n\nIn a letter to Costa, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said that he would refuse to back any move that “would include covering Ukraine’s military expenses for the coming years.”\n\nHe warned “that the use of frozen Russian assets could directly jeopardize U.S. peace efforts, which directly count on the use of these resources for the reconstruction of Ukraine.”\n\nBut the commission argues that the war has imposed heavy costs by hiking energy prices and stunting economic growth in the EU, which has already provided nearly 200 billion euros ($235 billion) in support to Ukraine.\n\nBelgium, where Euroclear is based, is opposed to the “reparations loan” plan. It says that the plan “entails consequential economic, financial and legal risks,” and has called on other EU countries to share the risk.\n\nRussia’s Central Bank, meanwhile, said on Friday that it has filed a lawsuit in Moscow against Euroclear for damages it says were caused when Moscow was barred from managing the assets. Euroclear declined to comment.\n\nThe Belgian clearing house has around 17 billion euros ($20 billion) in Russia and it’s unclear what would happen to that money if the legal challenge or others like it succeed.\n\nIn a separate statement, the Central Bank also described wider EU plans to use Russian assets to aid Ukraine as “illegal, contrary to international law,” arguing that they violated “the principles of sovereign immunity of assets.”\n\nBut EU Economy Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis brushed off the suit, saying that the decision is “legally robust,” and that he expects Russia “to continue to launch speculative legal proceedings to prevent the EU from upholding international law.”\n\nChris Weafer, CEO of Macro-Advisory Ltd. Consultancy, said that the timing of the court action is “clearly linked” to the EU’s intention to use the frozen assets.\n\n“The Russian Central Bank is making clear that it will respond with legal actions against all countries involved in the decision to take the Russian money,” he said.\n\nFriday's EU decision came hours after Germany summoned the Russian ambassador in Berlin following allegations of sabotage, disinformation campaigns, cyberattacks and interference in its elections.",

The remarks by Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov underscore Moscow's ambition to maintain its presence in Donbas post-war.",
    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A senior Kremlin official said Friday that Russian police and National Guard will stay on in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas and oversee the industry-rich region, even if a peace settlement ends Russia's nearly four-year war in Ukraine.\n\nThe remarks by Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov underscore Moscow's ambition to maintain its presence in Donbas post-war. Ukraine is likely to reject such a stance as U.S.-led negotiations drag on.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukrainian units have recaptured several settlements and neighborhoods near the city of Kupiansk in the northeastern Kharkiv region, following a monthslong operation aimed at reversing Russian advances there.\n\nKupiansk has in recent months been one of the most closely contested sectors of the around 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, and the claimed Ukrainian progress of around 40 sq. km. (15 sq. miles) would be a setback for Russia.\n\nLess than two months ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Ukrainian troops in Kupiansk were surrounded and offered to negotiate their surrender. He said a media visit to the area would prove it. Putin has sought to portray Russia as negotiating from a position of strength in the war.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s office said he would host Zelenskyy on Monday for talks as peace efforts gain momentum and European leaders seek to steer negotiations. Afterward, numerous European heads of state and government, as well as the leaders of the European Union and NATO, will join the meeting, a statement said.\n\nMoscow will give its blessing to a ceasefire only after Ukraine’s forces have withdrawn from the front line, Ushakov also said in comments published Friday in Russian business daily Kommersant.\n\nHe told Kommersant “it’s entirely possible that there won’t be any troops (in the Donbas), either Russian or Ukrainian” in a postwar scenario. But he said that “there will be the National Guard, our police, everything necessary to maintain order and organize life.”\n\nFor months, American negotiators have tried to navigate the demands of each side as U.S. President Donald Trump presses for a swift end to Russia’s war and grows increasingly exasperated by delays. The search for possible compromises has run into a major obstacle over who keeps Ukrainian territory that Russian forces have occupied so far.\n\nSince Moscow’s 2014 illegal annexation of Crimea and the seizure of territory in the east by Russia-backed separatists later that year, as well as land taken after the full-blown invasion was launched on Feb. 24, 2022, Russia has captured about 20% of its neighbor.\n\nUkraine says its constitution doesn’t allow it to surrender land. Russia, which illegally annexed Donetsk and three other regions illegally in 2022, says the same. Ushakov said that “no matter what the outcome (of peace talks), this territory (the Donbas) is Russian Federation territory.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump compared the negotiations to a very complex real estate deal. He said that he wants to see more progress in talks before sending envoys to possible meetings with European leaders over the weekend.\n\nIn October, Trump said the Donbas region will have to be \"cut up\" to end the war.\n\nIn recent months, Russia’s army has made a determined push to gain control of all parts of Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk, which together make up the valuable Donbas region.\n\nIts slow slog across the Ukrainian countryside, using its significant advantage in troop numbers in a corrosive war of attrition, has been costly in terms of casualties and losses of armor. Although outnumbered, Ukrainian defenders have held firm in many areas and counterattacked in others.\n\nUkrainian forces said Friday that they had advanced around Kupiansk. They gradually cut off Russian supply routes into the city, starting on Sept. 22, and regained control of the villages of Kindrashivka and Radkivka, as well as several northern districts of the city, according to a statement by Ukrainian National Guard’s Khartia Corps posted on Facebook.\n\nFighting is ongoing in central Kupiansk, where more than 200 Russian soldiers are encircled, the statement said.\n\nZelenskyy posted a video of himself standing on the road into Kupiansk on Friday. Explosions could be heard in the background as he spoke.\n\n“Today, it is critically important to achieve results on the battlefield so that Ukraine can achieve results in diplomacy,” Zelenskyy said in the video, praising his troops on Ukraine’s Ground Forces Day.\n\nRussian officials made no immediate comment, and the Ukrainians statements couldn't be independently verified.\n\nUkraine also has developed its long-range strike capabilities using domestically produced weapons to disrupt Russia's war machine.\n\nIts Special Operations Forces, or SSO, said Friday that an operation in the Caspian Sea struck two Russian vessels carrying military equipment and arms.\n\nThe ships named Kompozitor Rakhmaninov and Askar-Saridzha are under U.S. sanctions for transporting arms between Russia and Iran, the SSO said in a statement on social media. It didn't say what weapons it used in its attack.\n\nA Ukrainian drone attack wounded seven people, including a child, in the Russian city of Tver, acting Gov. Vitaly Korolev said Friday. Falling drone debris struck an apartment building in the city, which lies northwest of Moscow, Korolev said.\n\nRussia’s air defenses destroyed 90 Ukrainian drones overnight, Russia’s Defense Ministry said.\n\nRussian drones struck a residential area of Pavlohrad, in Ukraine’s central Dnipropetrovsk region, killing one person and wounding four others, the head of the local military administration, Vladyslav Haivanenko, wrote on the Telegram messaging channel on Friday.\n\nUkraine’s southern Odesa region came under a large-scale drone attack overnight, according to regional chief Oleh Kiper. The attack damaged energy infrastructure, he said. More than 90,000 people were without electricity on Friday morning, Deputy Energy Minister Roman Andarak said.\n\nUkraine’s air force said that Russia launched 80 drones across the country during the night.\n\nLitvinova reported from Tallinn, Estonia.

    "fullText": "Ukraine would join the European Union as early as January 2027 under the latest US plan to end the war with Russia, a senior source familiar with the matter told AFP on Friday.\n\nThe complicated EU accession process usually takes years and requires a unanimous vote from all 27 members of the bloc, and some countries, most notably Hungary, have consistently voiced opposition to Ukraine joining.\n\nThe idea of a speedy accession is included in the latest version of a US-led plan to end the war, which would also see Ukraine cede land to Russia, and has triggered a diplomatic frenzy across Europe in recent weeks.\n\n\"It's stated there but it's a matter for negotiation, and the Americans support it,\" the senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, referring to the US plan.\n\nWashington has the leverage needed to convince leaders opposed to Ukraine's membership to change their stance, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists, including AFP, on Thursday.\n\n\"The United States can take steps to unblock our path to the European Union,\" he said, adding that \"the US president has various levers of influence and that this will have an effect on those who are currently blocking Ukraine.\"\n\nKyiv has long strived for EU membership and has been implementing reforms since a pro-European 2014 revolution but has struggled to eradicate endemic corruption -- a core prerequisite for joining the bloc.\n\nAfter completing a diplomatic tour across Europe last week, Zelensky was due in Berlin on Monday for more talks on the plan, full details of which have not been released.\n\nZelensky will discuss \"the status of peace negotiations in Ukraine\" with \"numerous European heads of state and government, as well as the leaders of the EU and NATO,\" Berlin said.\n\nMoscow on Friday indicated it was suspicious about the efforts to amend the US plan, which it has largely been supportive of and heeded to most of its core demands.\n\n\"We have an impression that this version, which is being put forward for discussion, will be worsened,\" Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov told the Kommersant business daily.\n\n\"It'll be a long process,\" he added, saying that Moscow had not seen an updated version of the plan since discussions between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Moscow last week.\n\nZelensky said Thursday that Washington wants only Ukraine, not Russia, to withdraw its troops from parts of the eastern Donetsk region, where a demilitarised \"free economic zone\" would be installed as a buffer between the two armies.\n\nRussia, which has the numerical advantage in manpower and weapons, has been grinding forward on the battlefield for months, notching up its quickest advance for a year in November.\n\nHowever on Friday, Ukraine claimed to have retaken two settlements near Kupiansk -- a strategically important city and a key railway hub in the northeast of the country.\n\nZelensky visited the troops near Kupiansk to congratulate them -- and recorded a video of himself on a road at the entrance to the southwest of the city.\n\nA Russian air strike damaged a Turkish-owned cargo vessel in Ukraine's Black Sea region of Odesa, Kyiv and the operator said Friday, triggering fresh calls from Ankara to halt strikes on port infrastructure.\n\nTurkey earlier warned of a \"worrying escalation\" in the Black Sea after Ukraine claimed naval drone attacks on Russia-linked tankers in the area.",

    "description": "Russia saw a surge in consumer spending after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, even as sweeping sanctions hit the economy.",
    "fullText": "After years of wartime splurging, Russian shoppers are tightening their grip on their wallets — a shift that hints at growing stress in the country's economy.\n\nGrowth in consumer spending has weakened across most regions, the Central Bank of Russia said in a report published Wednesday.\n\nIn October and November, demand softened even as unemployment remained near historic lows and inflation expectations ticked higher.\n\n\"According to retailers across the country, an increasing share of products are being purchased during promotions, sales, and discounts. Household behavior has become more frugal,\" according to the central bank report.\n\nRetailers in many regions report weakening demand for big-ticket and nonessential goods, marking a clear cooling after the post-2022 consumer boom.\n\n\"More subdued consumption may indicate a gradual reduction in labor market overheating and more moderate expectations for future income dynamics,\" wrote Russia's central bank.\n\nIt's a notable shift for an economy that witnessed a boom in consumer spending after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, even amid sweeping sanctions against Moscow.\n\nThat boom was fueled by surging defense spending and intense competition for scarce workers. Wages jumped, and many households went on spending sprees.\n\nNow, that momentum appears to be fading.\n\nWage growth has slowed, and firms across multiple regions report reduced manpower demand and less urgency to hire, reflecting a cooling labor market, according to the central bank report.\n\nMany firms told the central bank they expect even more modest wage increases in 2026, suggesting that households may be bracing for leaner times.\n\nThe central bank's latest report arrives as Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine approaches its fifth year, and the limits of wartime economic stimulus become more apparent.\n\nOil and gas revenues — the backbone of Russia's budget — dropped 34% year-over-year in November.\n\nEven before this, analysts had warned that Russia's economy was being sustained largely by defense spending, subsidies, and emergency policy interventions.\n\nTop officials had sounded alarms. In December 2023, Elvira Nabiullina, Russia's central bank governor, warned that the economy was at risk of overheating.\n\nLast June, the head of Russia's largest bank said the economy was \"definitely and strongly overheated.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a deepening demographic crisis and ongoing competition for labor between the military and industry continue to weigh on Russia's growth prospects, both now and in the years ahead.",

    "description": "Drone schools in Ukraine say they've realized what traits tend to make people the best pilots for the fight against Russia.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's drone schools say it's clear: young, tech-savvy people with a gaming background make the best drone pilots.\n\nAcross the country, drone schools are training new operators for what has become one of the most important roles in Ukraine's fight against the Russian invasion — flying the drones that scout Russian positions, find targets, and blow up tanks and troops.\n\nThree leaders working at two schools told Business Insider that younger students with gaming or tech experience tend to consistently pick up skills the fastest. These students often are already comfortable with controllers, joysticks, and staring at a screen for a long time.\n\nThe instructor comments offer insight into what kind of person makes the best pilot, useful as Ukraine continues to fight for its survival and Western militaries study the war, investing more heavily in drone programs for a potential future fight.\n\nDmytro Slediuk, head of the education department at Dronarium, a drone training school with sites in Kyiv and Lviv, said younger people and gamers, \"are really good because their system of motor movements in their hands is already well developed.\"\n\nHis colleague, Tetyana, a Ukrainian veteran who goes by the call sign \"Ruda\" and is now the head of R&D for Dronarium, agreed, telling BI that \"those who used to play video games, those who are accustomed to using a joystick, would be better in terms of running an FPV drone.\"\n\nTechnical fluency matters too. It's easier to train people with IT or engineering backgrounds than it is teachers, marketing specialists, or accountants. This war is one of rapidly evolving technology and tactics, especially in drone warfare.\n\nBeing an operator isn't just about physical control; it's about really understanding how drones work and what they can do. The school strives to instill these principles in all students.\n\nAnd gaming experience, technical knowledge, and flexible adaptation in the face of new technology tend to be more easily found among younger students. If they're over 50, Tetyana explained, \"it is a bit more challenging for students to get hold of controlling some types of drones.\"\n\nVitalii Pervak, CEO of another training school, Karlsson, Karas & Associates, said someone who flies well isn't automatically a strong combat operator — but after a year of training, his team has identified what works.\n\n\"Young people aged 18-27 are the easiest to train,\" he said. \"They memorize information and acquire skills faster and more effectively. As we have noted, the older a person is, the more difficult it is for them to learn.\"\n\nSimilar to the other drone school leaders, Pervak said people who have a technical mindset can absorb training \"more easily and understand the intricacies of using UAVs in combat better.\" Those who were programmers and gamers often \"find it easiest to focus on a monitor for long periods of time. Everyone else must develop this skill.\"\n\nGood health is also key, but he said the school has nonetheless \"successfully trained people with visual and hearing impairments, back problems, contusions, and even head injuries.\"\n\nDrones account for about 60% of Ukraine's front-line strikes, according to the country's commander-in-chief. With shortages of artillery shells and other weaponry, Ukraine has leaned heavily on drones. The inexpensive systems have been highly effective at damaging and destroying equipment worth millions.\n\nCheap drones offer an asymmetric advantage and provide the Ukrainian military with combat power it couldn't generate with humans and crewed assets alone. But its drone force is only as strong as its pilots are capable, making drone training essential.\n\nThe drone school leaders are not alone in their assessment of who tends to make the best pilots.\n\nUkrainian soldiers with gaming backgrounds have also credited that experience for their skills, and Ukraine's special drone unit, Typhoon, previously told Business Insider that gamers make great drone pilots. But they also cautioned that real drone warfare is much more complicated and dangerous than any video game.\n\nOne Typhoon operator said that \"people think flying a military drone is like playing 'Call of Duty,' until they realize there's no restart option,\" referring to the popular video game.\n\nWestern drone pilots have previously expressed similar sentiments. Tanner Yackley, a former US Air Force drone operator who left in 2018, previously told Business Insider that it's fundamentally different because \"you're making life or death calls every single day.\"\n\n\"There's not a single game in the world that can prep you for what you're going to do,\" he said.\n\nAs NATO watches the war in Ukraine, worried about a wider conflict, its forces are already adapting and also looking to gamers, even embracing tech from the gaming world to make it easier for younger troops to quickly skill up on new technology.\n\nSome American and European troops, for instance, are training on a new air-defense system that uses an Xbox controller to launch interceptor drones.\n\nThe drone schools, however, are constantly grappling with challenges, such as limited funding, reliance on donated drones, and the threat of Russian strikes. They have to keep their curricula updated, with instructors traveling to the front and rewriting lessons every couple of weeks to match the rapid battlefield shifts.",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces used naval drones packed with explosives to attack an oil tanker identified as part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" in the Black Sea on Wednesday, a security source told Business Insider.\n\nThe naval drone strike on the tanker, Dashan, marks the third such attack in less than two weeks as Ukraine ramps up its long-range strike campaign against Russia's energy sector, increasingly gunning for ships at sea in addition to land-based oil facilities.\n\nSea Baby naval drones hit the tanker and caused \"critical damage\" to the vessel, with early indications indicating that the strike completely disabled the vessel, the source in the Security Service of Ukraine, the country's main internal security agency, revealed on Wednesday.\n\nThe SBU source, only authorized to speak anonymously to discuss sensitive military developments, said the Dashan was flying the Comoros flag and moving through Ukraine's exclusive economic zone in the direction of Novorossiysk, a Russian port city and major oil terminal.\n\nPublicly available ship-tracking data last showed the Dashan in the middle of the Black Sea.\n\nThe tanker was sailing at maximum speed with its transponder turned off, the security source said. They added that the attack was carried out in cooperation with the Ukrainian navy and shared footage captured by the Sea Baby drones showing multiple hits on the ship.\n\nSeveral Western countries and the European Union have sanctioned the $30 million tanker, which has been used for Russian oil exports and is known to sail with its transponder switched off, Ukraine's HUR military intelligence agency said.\n\nBusiness Insider could not independently verify the extent of the damage. Russia's defense ministry and its embassy in the US did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe attack on Wednesday appears to mark the third time in the last two weeks that Ukraine has disabled a tanker belonging to the \"shadow fleet.\" In late November, the SBU used naval drones to strike and damage two vessels before they loaded at Novorossiysk.\n\nThe \"shadow fleet\" is a collection of hundreds of vessels that Moscow uses to transport oil and circumvent sanctions on its energy exports, a major source of revenue. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly urged Kyiv's international partners to do more to prevent the ships from operating.\n\n\"The SBU continues to take active measures to reduce the receipt of petrodollars to the budget of the Russian Federation,\" the security source said on Wednesday, according to a translation of their remarks shared with Business Insider.\n\nUkraine has been stepping up its attacks against the Russian energy sector, the revenue from which fuels its war efforts, in recent months. Kyiv has used long-range drones to strike oil refineries and other facilities and infrastructure across the country.\n\nThe three tanker attacks appear to reflect a new shift for Ukraine — one that now increasingly attacks ships at sea rather than just land targets.",

Exactly why the aircraft was still flying is unclear, but it does raise some questions about the overall status of the Russian Aerospace Forces’ transport arm.\n\nAccording to the Investigative Committee of Russia, the country’s main federal investigating authority, the turboprop-powered airlifter went down near the village of Ivankovo. Eyewitnesses reported seeing the An-22 breaking apart in mid-air, with parts of the fuselage falling into a reservoir near the village. A video posted to social media purportedly shows a salvage team removing fragments of the aircraft from the Uvodskoye Reservoir.\n\nThe Investigative Committee of Russia has so far not disclosed how many people were on board, although the state-run TASS news agency puts the number at seven, and unconfirmed reports on social media provide names for each.\n\nRussian state media quoted the Russian Ministry of Defense as saying that the An-22 was undergoing a test flight “following repairs” when it crashed, suggesting it was in the process of being returned to service.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense confirmed that search crews were deployed to the crash site and an investigation was opened into the accident.\n\nCiting anonymous sources, the Kommersant business newspaper reported that the accident was likely caused by a technical malfunction.\n\nBack in August of last year, there were unconfirmed reports that Russia had finally ceased operations of its An-22 fleet altogether. At this time, it was suggested that the last example, registration number RF-09309, built in 1974, was flown from its home base of Migalovo in the Tver region of western Russia, to Yekaterinburg in the Ural Federal District on August 16, 2024. It was expected to be put on permanent display at the military museum in Verkhnyaya Pyshma. However, no An-22 is visible in recent satellite imagery of the collection, suggesting those plans may have changed.\n\nFrom August 16. \n\nFinal flight of Antei RF-09309 #14245D. Russia is retiring their An-22s. This one is slated to become part of a museum. \n\nPic by Artyom Kuzhlev pic.twitter.com/nvbO3BQjGZ\n\n— Evergreen Intel (@vcdgf555) August 24, 2024\n\nPotentially, RF-09309 is the same aircraft that crashed today, or it could have been one of the other four An-22s that were reportedly still active with the Russian Aerospace Forces’ 196th Military Transport Aviation Regiment as of June 2024.\n\nAt that point, Gen. Vladimir Venediktov, the commander of Military Transport Aviation, told Russia’s state-owned VGTRK broadcaster that the An-22 was headed for retirement before the end of that year.\n\nThat the An-22 survived that long, let alone that an example was still flying as of today, is somewhat remarkable.\n\nAs you can read about in detail here, the An-22 was designed and built by the Antonov company based in Kyiv, in what was then the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. The prototype flew on February 27, 1965, at which point it was the world’s heaviest aircraft.\n\nIn common with the Tupolev Tu-95 Bear bomber, the An-22 was powered by four huge Kuznetsov NK-12MA turboprops, each rated at more than 14,805 horsepower and driving eight-blade contra-rotating propellers, more than 20 feet in diameter.\n\nThe powerplant gave the An-22 a distinctive mechanical roar, as heard in the video below.\n\nIn all, 68 An-22s were completed, including two prototypes, between 1966 and 1976.\n\nService entry with the Soviet military was in January 1969, and the aircraft was especially valued for its ability to accommodate outsized loads.\n\nUp to more than 132,000 pounds of cargo could be carried. Alternatively, the An-22’s cargo hold had space for 151 paratroopers or 292 standard troops, carried on two decks. However, the main cargo hold was not pressurized, except for a forward cabin with seating for 29 personnel.\n\nItems of cargo included complete missile systems, as well as large and heavy military vehicles, via the large loading ramp at the rear. The aircraft could also operate from austere airfields if required.\n\nHowever, the Russian military chose to keep the An-22, even in limited numbers, since it was cheaper to operate than the An-124, but had a much bigger hold than the Ilyushin Il-76 Candid.\n\nPlans to modernize the surviving An-22s failed, however, with the result that the active Russian Aerospace Forces’ fleet dwindled to five.\n\nA sixth was still operated by the Antonov Design Bureau in Kyiv until it was reportedly damaged beyond repair during fighting at Hostomel Airport at the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion.\n\nThe fact that at least one An-22 was apparently being prepared to return to active service with the Russian Aerospace Forces appears to paint a bleak picture of its air transport arm.\n\nWhile it still operates significant numbers of Il-76s, in terms of heavy transports, Russia has also failed to reinstate production of the An-124. The main problem has been a lack of suitable engines — the original D-18T turbofan is manufactured by Motor Sich at its plant in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine. Meanwhile, Motor Sich is also the only company capable of overhauling these engines, reducing the availability of the Russian An-124 fleet. This factor also may have driven the An-22’s planned return to service.\n\nPlans to develop an all-new, all-Russian successor to the Ukrainian-designed An-124 have so far also failed to materialize.\n\nOverall, the Russian transport aircraft fleet is aging fast, and this may also have contributed to other recent accidents.\n\nIn July of this year, a civilian-operated Antonov An-24 Coke twin-turboprop regional airliner crashed near Tynda in the Amur region of eastern Russia. All 42 passengers and six crew members on board died. The aircraft, long obsolete, had been manufactured in 1976.\n\nIn the same month, two people were killed after an An-2 Colt utility transport crashed in southern Russia’s Krasnodar region. The An-2 was first flown in 1947, and the Soviet Union and Russia have collectively failed to develop a suitable successor for a type that remains in widespread use.\n\nThere have also been other Russian transport aircraft losses that may or may not be connected to the conflict in Ukraine, as well as pinpoint attacks on these aircraft by long-range Ukrainian drone strikes.\n\nAt the same time, the fleet, in general, is likely suffering from the effects of sanctions, especially when it comes to readiness levels.\n\nWith the war in Ukraine still raging, the Russian military’s demand for heavy-lift air transport is only going to continue. Whatever the reason for today’s crash, it is a blow to the Russian Aerospace Forces. Apart from the slim possibility that a contractor might try and obtain the remaining aircraft to exploit their unique capabilities, it seems altogether unlikely that the An-22 will find a way back into regular service after this latest incident.\n\nContact the author: thomas@thewarzone.com",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — Almost four years into Russia’s full-scale war on Ukraine, European Union leaders have committed to funding Kyiv’s economic and military needs for the next two years, one way or another. Ukraine is desperate and needs the money by early 2026.\n\nAt a summit next week, the 27 EU leaders will weigh whether to use tens of billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets held in Europe to help meet Ukraine’s requirements, which the International Monetary Fund puts at 135 billion euros ($157 billion).\n\nSuch a move has never been done before, and it comes with risks. The European Central Bank has warned that if Europeans appear willing to grab other countries' money, it could undermine confidence in the euro currency. Some member nations are also concerned about inviting retaliation from Russia.\n\nBelgium, where most of the assets are held, is the main opponent of the plan. It’s fearful that Russia will strike back, either through the courts or in more nefarious ways. A series of drone incidents near airports and military bases last month suggested that the Kremlin was already doing so, but those responsible were never publicly identified.\n\nEuropean Council President Antonio Costa, who will chair the Dec. 18 summit, has insisted that the leaders should not leave EU headquarters in Brussels until they have reached a decision.\n\nEU leaders froze the money, most of it in Russian Central Bank assets, over the war that Putin launched in February 2022. Moscow has described the scheme as “theft.”\n\nTwo plans have emerged. The first would be a “reparations loan” that would use the Russian assets until Moscow agrees to pay for the damage inflicted on Ukraine. Few think Russian President Vladimir Putin will ever agree to pay reparations.\n\nPlan B would be for the EU to borrow the money on financial markets, much as the bloc did to fund a massive loan plan to revive European economies after the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMany of Europe’s major economies are cash strapped and mired in debt. But Russia’s war on Ukraine poses an existential threat to the bloc. Intelligence assessments suggest that Putin could launch a war elsewhere in three to five years should he defeat Ukraine.\n\nThe assets make up a substantial pot of potentially ready-to-use cash.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU’s executive branch, estimates that 210 billion ($244 billion) euros worth of frozen assets are currently held in Europe. The vast majority — around 193 billion euros ($225 billion) at the end of September — are held in the Belgian financial clearinghouse known as Euroclear.\n\nThere are political advantages too. Should the EU choose to use the assets, only “a qualified majority” of countries — around a two-thirds majority — would be required for a green light. Borrowing on financial markets would have to be endorsed by all, meaning that even a single no vote would sink the idea.\n\nOver the last year, Hungary has blocked EU support for Ukraine at almost every turn. The government in Slovakia is starting to dig in its heels as well. A new and stridently nationalist leader in the Czech Republic could further complicate the decision.\n\nAvoiding a veto is in the interest of the vast majority of member countries.\n\nDetails of the reparations loan\n\nUnveiling her plan on Dec. 4, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU would cover two-thirds of Ukraine’s needs for 2026 and 2027, for a total of 90 billion euros ($105 billion). International partners would fill the gap.\n\nDue to EU sanctions on Russia’s assets, cash balances have accumulated at Euroclear. They’ve generated interest — some 3.9 billion euros ($4.5 billion) this year, Euroclear says — which is already being used to fund a Group of Seven loan plan for Ukraine.\n\nUnder the new plan, some of the cash would be transferred to an EU debt instrument. Ukraine would owe the EU the money but would repay only after the bloc’s sanctions are lifted and after Russia agrees to pay war reparations.\n\nThe commission insists that there is no “theft,” as Russia has claimed, because the right of the Russian Central Bank to make a claim on its money and Euroclear’s duty to repay will remain intact.\n\nOnce Putin pays war reparations, Ukraine would repay the EU, the EU would repay Euroclear, and Euroclear would repay the Russian Central Bank.\n\nImportantly for Belgium, the plan contains safeguards to ensure that the risks would be shared by its partners. Other EU countries would offer to guarantee the loan if something went wrong. Germany has already signaled that it would do so.\n\nBut the Belgian government has not been assuaged. Even before the commission's reparations loan plan was made public, Foreign Minister Maxime Prévot said that it “entails consequential economic, financial and legal risks.”\n\nPrévot said Belgium — a strong backer of Ukraine that has provided military and financial support — feels that its concerns are not being heard by its EU partners.\n\n“We are not seeking to antagonize our partners or Ukraine. We are simply seeking to avoid potential disastrous consequences for a member state that is being asked to show solidarity without being offered the same solidarity in return,” he said.\n\nIn an interview with Belgian public broadcaster RTBF last week, Euroclear CEO Valerie Urbain also said that court action could not be ruled out should the EU oblige the clearinghouse to transfer its Russian assets.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had no time to hold a traditional news conference during a whirlwind, 36-hour trip across Europe this week, so he improvised.\n\nFor the first time since Russia's full-scale invasion of his country, Zelenskyy — who usually takes reporters’ questions in person while trotting the globe — communicated with the news media via group chat. While flying between London and Brussels, he answered a long list of questions from Ukrainian and international reporters, relaying audio clips on WhatsApp.\n\nHis chosen mode of communication was, if not unprecedented, at the very least extremely rare for a world leader.\n\nThe low drone of the aircraft blended with his hoarse, tired-sounding voice, yet his message cut through clearly: Amid uncertain negotiations to end the war, Ukraine, he said, cannot surrender land.\n\n“Undoubtedly, Russia insists for us to give up territories,” he said in a crackling message late Monday. “According to the law, we don’t have such a right … and to be frank, we don’t have a moral right either.”\n\nWith the outlook for negotiations changing by the day, Zelenskyy’s team set out on a jam-packed schedule to shore up support in Europe.\n\nZelenskyy met the leaders of Britain, Germany and France in London, and the heads of NATO and the European Union in Brussels, before traveling on to Rome for talks with the Italian prime minister and Pope Leo XIV.\n\nA key issue being discussed is whether Ukraine should cede Russian‑occupied territory in return for security guarantees, but the talks have been complicated by uncertainty about the Trump administration’s commitment to European security.\n\nSince the start of the war, Zelenskyy has shown a desire to communicate in real-time in whatever way is necessary.\n\nWhen Kyiv came under siege shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, Zelenskyy tried to reassure the public through what appeared to be a cellphone video with three top officials — perhaps his best-known address.\n\n“We are all here,” he said at the time. “Our soldiers are here, the citizens of our country are all here protecting our independence, and we are going to continue to do so.”\n\nSince then, Zelenskyy has made frequent communication a strategic priority in a sleep-defying cycle of video messages, remote speeches to Western parliaments and conferences, late-night posts and high-security public appearances.\n\nMonday night’s WhatsApp exchange wound down as his plane landed in Brussels, just before he was whisked into his next round of meetings.\n\nHe asked reporters: “How did you like this format? If it works for you, then when we have the opportunity, we’ll share our thoughts and decisions this way again.”\n\nIt didn't take long. By Tuesday evening, Zelenskyy had sent reporters more audio messages on WhatsApp to explain how talks to end the war were proceeding with its Western allies.",
