    "fullText": "Russia could be staring down a painful financial reckoning in Venezuela after the US military operation on January 3 threw into doubt years of strategic investment and cooperation between Moscow and Caracas, according to a think tank analyst.\n\n\"Russian investments in Venezuela's oil industry over the last twenty years will now have to be, formally or informally, written off,\" wrote Stephen Sestanovich, the George F. Kennan senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, in a post on Wednesday.\n\nLoans for Venezuela's purchase of Russian weapons could meet the same fate, added Sestanovich, a former ambassador-at-large for the former Soviet Union at the State Department.\n\n\"The overall market appeal of such arms has clearly been diminished,\" following the US's military operation, he wrote.\n\nSome $2 billion to $3 billion in annual trade between Russia and Venezuela could also \"cease altogether,\" he added.\n\nThose concrete economic losses contrast with more intangible political upsides for Moscow in a shifting global order, he added.\n\n\"The Trump administration's emphasis on preserving a US sphere of influence in the Western Hemisphere could also seem to validate Russia's claims for a similar sphere in its own neighborhood,\" Sestanovich wrote.\n\nThe developments come at a sensitive moment for Russia's economy, as its war in Ukraine approaches its fifth year next month.\n\nSweeping Western sanctions and depressed oil prices are squeezing Russia's revenues, putting pressure on the funds Moscow uses to sustain the war effort and support the broader economy.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has not commented publicly on the US's operation in Venezuela. The Russian foreign ​ministry has called for deposed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's release and for dialogue between the US and Venezuela.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian state-owned oil company Roszarubezhneft sought to draw a line around its oil holdings in Venezuela. The company said earlier this week that all its assets in the South American country are \"owned by the Russian state.\"",

The former head of Ukraine’s digital transformation policies is credited with spearheading the the army's drone technology and introducing several successful e-government platforms.\n\nHis appointment was part of a broad government reshuffle that the Ukrainian leader said aimed to sharpen the focus on security, defense development and diplomacy amid a new U.S.-led push to find a peace settlement.\n\nFedorov said the defense ministry is facing a shortfall of 300 billion hryvnia ($6.9 billion) in funding needs.\n\nThe European Union will dedicate most of a massive new loan program to help fund Ukraine’s military and economy over the next two years, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday.\n\nFedorov said Ukraine’s defense sector has expanded significantly since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. At the start of the war, he said, the country had seven private drone companies and two firms developing electronic warfare systems. Today, he said, there are nearly 500 drone manufacturers and about 200 electronic warfare companies in Ukraine.\n\nHe added that some sectors have emerged from scratch, including private missile producers, which now number about 20, and more than 100 companies manufacturing ground-based robotic systems.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "Up to 25,000 Russian soldiers are being killed every month, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said this week.",
    "fullText": "Russia's military is suffering heavy losses fighting in Ukraine, with up to 25,000 soldiers killed a month, NATO's top civilian official said this week, calling the carnage \"unsustainable\" for Moscow.\n\n\"The Russians, at the moment, are losing massive amounts of their soldiers thanks to the Ukrainian defense,\" NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told European lawmakers at a forum in Brussels on Tuesday. He said that 20,000 to 25,000 troops are dying each month as the war drags on.\n\n\"I'm not talking seriously wounded. Killed.\" Rutte clarified. He compared the incredibly high losses to the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, where an estimated 15,000 of its soldiers were killed over a period of more than nine years.\n\n\"Now they lose this amount or \n\nRussia has not disclosed official casualty figures, but Ukrainian and Western estimates paint a grim picture for Moscow.\n\nBritain's defense ministry said in an intelligence update Wednesday that Russia has likely suffered over 1.2 million battlefield casualties since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, averaging 1,100 soldiers killed and wounded every day last month.\n\nRussia's average daily casualty rate from August to December 2025 increased steadily, although it was still lower than during the same months in 2024, according to the ministry. It said the recent uptick came as Moscow made small territorial gains, and the heavy losses are expected to roll into 2026 \"with continued dismounted infantry attacks on multiple axes.\"\n\nRussian forces have been focused on seizing the war-torn city of Pokrovsk in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region for more than a year. It has been the site of some of the war's most intense fighting.\n\nUkrainian officials have said that attack drones are the biggest battlefield killer of people and equipment, believed to be responsible for eliminating around 90% of all targets hit. Military units regularly publish footage of their combat kills on social media.\n\nThe casualty assessments underscore the significant attrition for Russia. It has a much larger population pool from which it can pull new soldiers and replenish losses than Ukraine does. However, Moscow has tried to avoid large-scale involuntary mobilization during the war, and conflict analysts believe it is unlikely to do so anytime soon.\n\nKateryna Stepanenko, a Russia research fellow with the Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank, told Business Insider that Moscow has increasingly relied on covert and informal recruitment networks to avoid a full mobilization, which would likely come at a tremendous political cost.\n\nRussian military efforts to bring fresh troops into its war against Ukraine include offering financial benefits to some informal recruiters, sourcing combat personnel from overseas, and playing with the legislation on the use of active and inactive reserves, among some other unofficial methods, Stepanenko said.\n\n\"Before, the Kremlin just assigned your military recruitment centers, some paramilitary organizations, and regional authorities to do recruitment,\" she said. Now, Moscow has to think: \"Where else can we squeeze recruits from?\"\n\nUS and Ukrainian assessments from last year suggested that Russia was pulling an average of 30,000 to 36,000 new soldiers a month into the war, figures similar to its casualty rate. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said thousands more than that are volunteering.\n\n\"It is certainly a challenge for Russian forces to replace personnel and replace the casualties,\" Stepanenko said, adding that Russia will eventually \"hit a wall\" if it doesn't change its personnel and recruitment system eventually.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine, which does not disclose official casualty figures similar to Russia, is believed to have suffered an estimated 400,000 soldiers killed and wounded. Those losses hit hard, as Ukraine faces a constant struggle for manpower.\n\nThe proliferation of drones over the battlefield has made it increasingly difficult to evacuate casualties from a widening kill zone that extends in both directions along the front line, significantly contributing to the heavy losses.\n\nUkrainian and Western soldiers and officers have said that \"golden hour\" — the first 60 minutes after a severe injury when medical treatment determines whether a soldier lives or dies — is long gone in this war.",

    "fullText": "Global oil prices surged on Tuesday as markets reacted to the escalating drone strikes at the Novorossiysk terminal, which handles roughly 2% of the world's daily supply. The disruption to the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) infrastructure, a vital artery for Kazakh exports managed by Western majors like Chevron and Shell, raised immediate fears of a prolonged supply squeeze.\n\nWhile Brent was trading at $65.13, up 1.9%.\n\nTwo oil tankers waiting to load crude from some of Kazakhstan’s biggest oilfields were hit by drones at the marine terminal of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) near Novorossiysk on Russia’s Black Sea coast, sources told Reuters.\n\nThe Caspian Pipeline Consortium Marine Terminal, a major oil export facility close to Novorossiysk, handles most of Kazakhstan’s crude oil exports, as well as some Russian crude supply.\n\nThe Delta Harmony and the Matilda tankers were waiting to load crude from Tengizchevroil and Karachaganak, respectively, according to Reuters’ sources.\n\nTengizchevroil, operating the supergiant Tengiz oilfield in Kazakhstan, is managed by a consortium led by U.S. oil and gas supermajor Chevron. Karachaganak, another giant field in Kazakhstan, is operated by a consortium comprising Shell, Chevron, and Italy’s Eni, among others.\n\nDrone attacks at or near the CPC terminal have intensified in recent weeks and have affected the loading and departure schedules of Kazakhstan’s crude cargoes.\n\nKazakhstan’s oil output fell sharply at the end of November and early December after damage at the CPC export terminal disrupted flows. Output dropped in the first two days of December after storms and structural damage limited loading capacity at the Black Sea terminal, prompting producers to scale back throughput as storage filled.\n\nKazakhstan relies on the CPC for roughly 80% of its crude exports.\n\nThe disruption came at a sensitive moment for Kazakhstan, which was attempting to stabilize production following repeated CPC interruptions earlier in 2025.\n\nOil has continued to flow, but at lower rates, while Kazakhstan sought to re-route some exports away from the Black Sea to keep supply relatively steady.\n\nCPC operates the pipeline from the Caspian coast in northwest Kazakhstan to the Novorossiysk port, which handles 80% of Kazakhstan’s crude exports from giant oilfields operated by international oil firms.\n\nAffiliates of Chevron and ExxonMobil are also minority shareholders in CPC, with the Russian Federation as its largest shareholder with a 24% stake.",

    "fullText": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States accused Russia on Monday of a “dangerous and inexplicable escalation” of its nearly four-year war in Ukraine at a time when the Trump administration is trying to advance negotiations toward peace.\n\nU.S. deputy ambassador to the United Nations Tammy Bruce singled out Russia’s launch of a nuclear-capable Oreshnik ballistic missile last week close to Ukraine’s border with Poland, a NATO ally.\n\nShe told an emergency meeting of the Security Council that the United States deplores “the staggering number of casualties” in the conflict and condemns Russia’s intensifying attacks on energy and other infrastructure.\n\nUkraine called for the meeting after last Thursday’s overnight Russian bombardment with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles, including the powerful, new hypersonic Oreshnik missile, which Moscow used for only the second time in what was a clear warning to Kyiv’s NATO allies.\n\nThe large-scale attack came days after Ukraine and its allies reported major progress toward agreeing on how to defend the country from further Moscow aggression if a U.S.-led peace deal is struck.\n\nThe attack also coincided with a new chill in relations between Moscow and Washington after Russia condemned the U.S. seizure of an oil tanker in the North Atlantic. And it came as U.S. President Donald Trump signaled he is on board with a hard-hitting sanctions package meant to economically cripple Russia.\n\nMoscow has given no public signal it is willing to budge from its maximalist demands on Ukraine. And Russia's U.N. ambassador on Monday blamed the diplomatic impasse on Ukraine.\n\nEurope’s leaders condemned the attack using the Oreshnik as “escalatory and unacceptable,” and U.S. envoy Bruce was equally tough on Monday.\n\n“At a moment of tremendous potential, due only to President Trump’s unparalleled commitment to peace around the world, both sides should be seeking ways to de-escalate,” she said. “Yet Russia’s action risks expanding and intensifying the war.”\n\nBruce reminded Russia that nearly a year ago it voted in favor of a Security Council resolution calling for an end to the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n“It would be nice if Russia matched their words with deeds,” she said. “In the spirit of that resolution, Russia, Ukraine and Europe must pursue peace seriously and bring this nightmare to an end.”\n\nBut Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council that until Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “comes to his senses and agrees to realistic conditions for negotiations, we will continue solving the problem by military means.”\n\n“He was warned long ago, with each passing day, each day which he squanders, the conditions for negotiations will only get worse for him,” Nebenzia said. “Similarly, each vile attack on Russian civilians will elicit a stiff response.”\n\nUkraine’s U.N. Ambassador Andriy Melnyk countered that Russia is more vulnerable now than at any time since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Its economy is slowing and oil revenue is down.\n\n“Russia wants to sell to this council and the whole U.N. family the impression that it is invincible, but this is another illusion,” he told the council. “The carefully staged image of strength is nothing but smoke and mirrors, completely detached from reality.”",

I have difficulties seeing the difference between the way the Americans are acting towards Greenland, and Russia, where you can see that the interest is to make their [territory] bigger.”\n\n“We are not for sale. We don’t want to be Americans, we want to be Greenlanders,” Berthelsen, a former Greenlandic foreign minister, told the Financial Times.\n\n“I don’t want to live in an American empire,” resident Maja Overgaard said in the same report, while fisherman Helte Johannsen dismissed Trump outright: “I don’t think that Trump knows anything about Greenland.”\n\nTrump has ramped up his threats to take over Greenland after the U.S. kidnapped Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro in an unprecedented military move, and said it would run the country during a transition period.\n\nDuring a press gaggle aboard Air Force One on Sunday, the president was asked whether he was still planning U.S. military action against Greenland, an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\n“If we don’t take Greenland, Russia or China will,” Trump said. “And I’m not letting that happen.”\n\nWhen asked if Greenland could “offer” him anything, he said, “Sure, I’d love to make a deal with them, that’s easier. But one way or the other, we’re gonna have Greenland.”\n\nTrump made a similar threat in a speech to Congress in March.\n\nOn Sunday, he clarified his approach: “Look, we’re talking about acquiring, not leasing, not having it short term. We’re talking about acquiring. And if we don’t do it, Russia or China will. And that’s not going to happen when I’m president.”\n\nHe repeated the threat Friday, telling reporters, “We are going to do something in Greenland, whether they like it or not,” and added he would “do it the hard way” if a deal could not be reached.\n\nDenmark and Greenland have consistently rejected the idea, warning that U.S. military action could threaten NATO and emphasizing that Greenland is not for sale.\n\nLast week, Greenland’s government and opposition issued a joint statement: “We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders. The future of Greenland must be decided by the Greenlandic people.”\n\nGreenland, home to around 56,000 people mostly near Nuuk, is largely covered by ice but holds strategic and economic importance. Its location makes it vital to U.S. military early-warning systems, and melting ice has opened access to valuable resources, such as rare-earth minerals, drawing growing international interest.\n\n“It’s not fun being 56,000 people and having these threats—if you can call them that—from a giant like the US,” Masaana Egede, editor of Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq, told the BBC last week.\n\n“The citizens of Greenland are nervous about this, because this is not something that we take lightly.”\n\nA 2025 Verian poll showed that only 6 percent of Greenlanders are in favour of becoming part of the U.S., with 9 percent undecided.",

    "fullText": "A Ukrainian drone strike killed one person and wounded three others in the Russian city of Voronezh, local officials said Sunday. Meanwhile, thousands of residents were still without power in Kyiv, following an intense Russian bombardment.\n\nA young woman died overnight in a hospital intensive care unit after debris from a drone fell on a house during the attack on Saturday, Voronezh regional Gov. Alexander Gusev said on Telegram.\n\nThree other people were wounded and more than 10 apartment buildings, private houses and a high school were damaged, he said, adding that air defenses shot down 17 drones over Voronezh. The city is home to just over 1 million people and lies some 250 kilometers (155 miles) from the Ukrainian border.\n\nUkraine's General Staff said Sunday said its forces hit three drilling platforms operated by Russian oil giant Lukoil in the waters of the Caspian Sea. Ukraine’s long-range drone strikes on Russian energy sites aim to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue its full-scale invasion.\n\nThe attacks came after Russia bombarded Ukraine with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles overnight into Friday, killing at least four people in the capital Kyiv, according to Ukrainian officials. For only the second time in the nearly four-year war, Russia used a powerful new hypersonic missile that struck western Ukraine in a clear warning to Kyiv and NATO.\n\nUkraine’s largest private energy supplier, DTEK, said Sunday that 30,000 people in Kyiv were still without power following the attack. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said Friday around half the apartment buildings — nearly 6,000 — in snowy Kyiv were left without heat in daytime temperatures of about minus 8 degrees Celsius (17.6 Fahrenheit).\n\nThe intense barrage and the launch of the nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile followed reports of major progress in talks between Ukraine and its allies on how to defend the country from further aggression by Moscow if a U.S.-led peace deal is struck.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday in his nightly address that Ukrainian negotiators “continue to communicate with the American side.”\n\nChief negotiator Rustem Umerov was in contact with U.S. partners on Saturday, he said.\n\nSeparately, Ukraine’s General Staff said Russia targeted Ukraine with 154 drones overnight into Sunday and 125 were shot down.\n\nThe Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s main intelligence directorate said Sunday that Russia this month deployed the new jet-powered “Geran-5” strike drone against Ukraine for the first time. The Geran is a Russian variant of the Iranian-designed Shahed.\n\nAccording to the directorate, the drone can carry a 90-kilogram (200-pound) warhead and has a range of nearly 1,000 kilometers (620 miles).\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "Sgt. Dimko Zhluktenko, a commander of a drone team, told Business Insider what it was like flying in the heavy fog that Russia used to its advantage.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sgt. Dimko Zhluktenko, an ISR drone team leader in Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces. He deployed in 2025 near Pokrovsk, a key city that Russia said it captured in early December.\n\nBusiness Insider has verified his role in the Ukrainian armed forces. The article has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBefore the full-scale war, I was a software engineer, working for companies in San Francisco, New Zealand, and Germany.\n\nToday, I lead a team of five to six Ukrainian drone operators. Our task is to use high-flying drones to provide reconnaissance data to our troops and commanders.\n\nWith our intelligence, artillery such as HIMARS and drone strike teams can target Russian equipment and soldiers, often before they can even reach the front lines.\n\nWe were redeployed to the Pokrovsk area in August because the fighting there had become so intense. Because drone operators are priority targets in the war, we would spend our dayslong rotations in houses and underground bunkers outside the city.\n\nWhen we first arrived, the weather was sunny and ideal for flying.\n\nBut the end of October was a disaster for us. Ukraine turns foggy in the autumn, with thick and low clouds that can stack from 100 meters to 300 meters above the ground.\n\nThese are so thick that no infrared camera or thermal camera can see through them, and caused many days to be completely no-go for flying for our types of drones.\n\nAt the time, the Russians took advantage of the clouds, using them to cover their advance on foot and in vehicles. Given the weather, the number of personnel they sacrificed to take the city, and our limited resources, there was eventually no viable way for us to defend Pokrovsk forever.\n\nUkraine is dependent on drone warfare. It has carried us through the terrible and scary times of these Russian assaults, and it has changed the face of war. For the entire summer of 2025, for example, I saw a tank only twice on the battlefield.\n\nDrones are cheap and effective, and if we had an infinite number of drones, we would have been working 24/7 to fight the Russians in Pokrovsk.\n\nBut we don't have infinite drones, so in the meantime, we need other strike tools and resources, such as more artillery fire and troops. War is complex, and drones cannot be its only solution.\n\nIn normal conditions, we fly our drones four times a day, with each flight lasting about three to four hours and sometimes into the night. It's tiring, but worth it, because you can make an enormous difference for Ukrainian defenders. We can spot where Russian forces are moving, denying them the element of surprise, and scout for assets such as air defenses and artillery for commanders to strike.\n\nRecon drone operators like us rely heavily on visual navigation. We study Pokrovsk so closely that, even when our drone is being spoofed, we can determine our flying location simply by the shape of the terrain or landmarks.\n\nWhen the foggy season comes, we try to make the most of any good visibility. Sometimes, you can get lucky and perform five flights in a five-day rotation.\n\nHowever, there were days when we found ourselves sitting in a house, just waiting for the weather to clear.\n\nYou can try to fly under the clouds, but going low means our bulky drones are more easily spotted and destroyed. Since we have limited tools, we try to preserve them and not use them recklessly.\n\nStill, on days with strong winds, there's a chance that the clouds may break slightly and give you glimpses of the battlefield. Sometimes, when visibility is bad but not impossible to work with, we must risk flying in such weather, especially if our troops are defending against a major assault.\n\nIn late summer, the situation in Pokrovsk was becoming increasingly problematic, both on the ground and in the sky. Back in the day, we would help long-range artillery focus on the Russian rear.\n\nI began to notice that Russia's tactics were making an impact around September.\n\nAcross the warzone, their strategy is to find our limit and overwhelm it with the smallest number of soldiers needed to seize our positions.\n\nIt is simple mathematics. Initially, they would send around 10 soldiers. If that wasn't enough, they would send 20. Then they would try 30.\n\nDay by day, they increase the number of troops and equipment. Their goal is to create a situation where we don't have enough drones to counter the amount of attacking infantry.\n\nTo eliminate an assault of 50 guys, all spread out, we'd need at least 150 drones and artillery, which is difficult for us to organize with our limited resources.\n\nWhen we were working in Pokrovsk, there were already areas of the city where the Russians had advanced, so the fighting area was porous and undefined.\n\nIf we had more troops, we could have held out for much longer and performed more aggressive maneuvers.\n\nIf we had more recon drones, our team could have flown over Pokrovsk nonstop, working despite the clouds.\n\nWith more first-person-view strike drones, our pilots could continue to find and attack the Russians closer to the ground.\n\nBut we don't have enough. So, we need other strike tools besides FPV drones, even though they account for about 80% of our kills on Russians.\n\nIronically, some of these tools have disappeared because warfare has changed so much. Mortars might have helped, but we mostly stopped using them — the battlefield is now so transparent that it is a suicide mission to ride around close to the front line in your pickup truck with a mortar.\n\nWhat we definitely need is artillery ammunition. Last year, some HIMARS units I worked with were rationed to four strikes a week.\n\nOther artillery units were limited to just three artillery shells a day. We would find them a target, and they would say: \"We don't have any more for today. Sorry, guys.\"\n\nThe weather in this season means it is still what drone pilots call our \"low season.\" At the same time, the terrain is now not too muddy, so it is the perfect time for Russians to attack.\n\nThis month, I am redeploying to Dnipro. The fight continues.",

    "description": "Ukraine said the \"Geran-5\" bears similarities to Iran's Karrar attack drone, and uses a more powerful engine than Russia's current turbojet Shaheds.",
    "fullText": "Russia has attacked Ukraine with a new type of long-range drone that uses a powerful jet engine to fly 600 miles with a 200-pound explosive warhead, Kyiv's military intelligence agency said.\n\nThe Ukrainian intelligence directorate, or GUR, released a statement on Sunday providing new details about what it dubbed the \"Geran-5.\"\n\nGUR said the drone was used during an attack in early 2026.\n\n\"Unlike previous modifications of the 'Geran' line, the device is made according to a normal aerodynamic scheme,\" GUR said, adding that the Geran-5 bears a strong resemblance to Iran's Karrar attack drone.\n\nPublished images showed wreckage of the apparent device on snow-laden ground, which included long fixed wings attached to a slender chassis. Business Insider could not independently verify the location and date of the images.\n\nThe Geran-5 is roughly 20 feet long, with a wingspan of about 18 feet, GUR added.\n\n\"The warhead weighs about 90 kg, and the declared range is about 1,000 km,\" the intelligence agency said.\n\nRussia's Geran drone family is most often associated with the Iranian-designed Shahed loitering munition. The Geran-1, Geran-2, and Geran-3 are inexpensive, mass-manufactured drones modeled after the Shahed but tweaked for production inside Russia.\n\nWhile the new drone's design differs significantly from that of the typical Shahed, GUR said it was being classified as a type of Geran because it shares many key components with Russian Shahed-like drones.\n\nThese include a jet engine made by Telefly, a Chinese company, and a microcomputer that GUR said is modeled after Raspberry Pi, a UK-designed low-cost computer that fits on a small board.\n\nThe Geran-3, a newer drone resembling Iran's Shahed-238, was earlier reported by Ukraine to use a Telefly JT80 turbojet engine that allows the device to fly at speeds of up to 230 miles per hour.\n\nGUR said the Telefly engine on the Geran-5 generates even more thrust, but did not give specifics about the drone's speed.\n\nUkrainian authorities have said that they've found Raspberry Pi 4 computers on Russia's more commonly used Geran-2s. These drones, modeled after the Shahed-136, are Russia's main tool in the hundreds-strong waves bombarding Ukraine and require computers for functions such as transmitting navigation data to operators.\n\nTelefly did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Business Insider. The Raspberry Pi Foundation did not respond to a similar request sent outside regular business hours.\n\nGUR said that the Geran-5 also uses 3G and 4G modems, as well as a 12-channel Comet, otherwise known as Kometa, satellite navigation system. The Kometa is typically known to use multiple antennas, which makes it more resistant to jamming.\n\n\"As with previous 'geraniums,' this UAV is difficult to consider as a Russian Federation development,\" GUR said.\n\nNotably, the intelligence agency said it had information that Russia is looking to launch the Geran-5 from another aircraft, such as the Sukhoi Su-25 fighter jet.\n\nUsing the drone in this way would likely greatly increase its operational range, since the Su-25 can fly out a distance before launching the Geran-5. Russia has typically been launching its older Gerans from ground-based ramps in Western Russia, annexed Crimea, and occupied Ukraine.\n\n\"Separately, the possibility of equipping the aircraft with R-73 air-to-air missiles to counter Ukrainian aviation is being considered,\" GUR said.\n\nThe R-73 is a Soviet-era heat-seeking missile, also known as the AA-11 Archer by NATO, designed to be fired from fighter jets to attack other aircraft.\n\nUkraine has previously said that it found Russia had mounted some of its Geran-2s with the R-60, an older air-to-air missile, to target aircraft such as helicopters trying to hunt down drones.",

Greenland sits at the center of it all — a vast slab of territory that dominates the map not by population, but by consequence.\n\nSet aside the outrage and the pearl-clutching, and the case becomes clear. Seen through a realist lens — the kind John Mearsheimer describes — power is never polite. Nations do not glide through history on good will. They compete, maneuver, and block rivals wherever they can.\n\nAmerica didn’t invent this contest, but it has played it for a century, shaping trade routes, locking down strategic chokepoints, and denying rivals room to expand. Exiting now would not end the game — it would simply forfeit the advantage.\n\nGreenland matters because the Arctic matters. Melting ice has turned what was once a frozen buffer into a contested corridor. Shipping lanes are emerging. Subsea cables snake across the ocean floor. Missile paths shorten. Surveillance gaps narrow. Russia knows this. China knows this. Both are investing heavily in Arctic presence, infrastructure and influence. The U.S. can either treat Greenland as a distant curiosity or as what it actually is: a forward position in a region that will define future power balances.\n\nThis is why the talk of acquiring it refuses to die. Under Trump, it has resurfaced less from recklessness than from bluntness. He says aloud what others preferred to bury in briefings. Previous administrations whispered the same concerns behind closed doors, then settled for half-measures and cosmetic compromises. Trump simply said the quiet part out loud, with his usual lack of decorum and surplus of disruption. Allies recoiled. But in cold political terms, offense is secondary to advantage.\n\nThe preferred path is obvious and needs no justification. Buying Greenland is better than bullying it. A negotiated transfer, with guarantees for Greenlanders and compensation for Denmark, would be cleaner, cheaper, and far less destabilizing than any military move. War in the Arctic would be absurd, expensive and counterproductive. Even floating the idea of force is less about intent than leverage. It is a reminder that the U.S. takes the matter seriously, not a rehearsal for invasion.\n\nCritics insist Greenland’s future is not Washington’s to decide. Formally, they are right. Strategically, however, that statement is comforting nonsense. In a world of rising rivalry, no great power allows vital terrain to drift into adversarial hands out of courtesy. Sovereignty is sacred until security is threatened; then it becomes negotiable. This isn’t cynicism, but the hard ledger of history.\n\nThe U.S. bought Louisiana not out of generosity, but to deny France control of the Mississippi. It backed Panama’s break from Colombia to secure a canal it deemed vital. It purchased Alaska to keep Russia away from its doorstep. Britain took Gibraltar for the same reason: Position beats principle when survival is involved. States talk reverently about borders, right up until borders threaten them. When security tightens, ideals are revised.\n\nThe European backlash, while predictable, is also revealing. Europe benefits enormously from American security guarantees, but recoils whenever Washington acts like a power rather than a charity. There is something faintly comic about NATO allies warning the U.S. against taking its own defense too seriously. The alliance rests, after all, on the assumption that America has never been a feelings-first power. Greenland reveals whether it still remembers that.\n\nEuropean nations insist Greenland is not for sale, while quietly relying on American troops, money and missiles to keep the peace that permits such comfortable posturing. It is a bit like lecturing the fire brigade on property rights while borrowing their hoses. Principles are easier to defend when someone else pays the insurance.\n\nThe deeper issue is not Trump’s rhetoric but America’s reluctance to admit what it is. The U.S. remains a global power in a competitive world. It cannot afford strategic blind spots disguised as virtue. Greenland is not a vanity project or a colonial hangover — it is a strategic anchor, a surveillance platform, a logistical hub, and a denial asset, all wrapped up into one. To lose influence there would not cause immediate collapse, but it would mark a significant retreat, the kind rivals notice long before voters do.\n\nThat is why this moment feels different. The language is sharper. The signals are stronger. Force remains the last resort, and rightly so. It is expensive, corrosive and unpredictable. Buying Greenland would cost money and pride, but far less than conflict. Realism doesn’t require hostility. The United States has often secured vital positions without resorting to force.\n\nIt gained long-term access to Iceland during World War II because the island mattered more than diplomatic niceties. It maintained strategic basing in Okinawa through negotiation, despite local resistance, because geography demanded it. It built Diego Garcia into a major military hub through negotiation and agreement rather than force. In each case, American security was strengthened without open conflict.\n\nGreenland deserves the same treatment now. Serious talks that reflect its importance. Offer fair payment to Denmark, respect local self-rule, and protect U.S. interests without turning the Arctic into an unnecessary flashpoint. Trump has his sights set on Greenland because the map leaves little room for alternatives.\n\nJohn Mac Ghlionn is a writer and researcher who explores culture, society and the impact of technology on daily life.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Ukrainian drone strike sparked a fire at an oil depot in Russia’s southern Volgograd region, officials said Saturday, after Russia launched a powerful hypersonic missile along with drones and other weapons that disrupted Kyiv's power supply and heating.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of casualties, Volgograd Gov. Andrei Bocharov was quoted as saying in a Telegram post published on the channel of the local administration. The post did not specify the damage, but said that people living near the depot may have to be evacuated.\n\nUkraine’s General Staff said Saturday it had struck the Zhutovskaya oil depot overnight. In a statement on Telegram, it said the depot is supplying fuel to Russian forces, adding that damage was being assessed.\n\nUkraine’s long-range drone strikes on Russian energy sites aim to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue its full-scale invasion. Russia wants to cripple the Ukrainian power grid, seeking to deny civilians access to heat, light and running water in what Kyiv officials say is an attempt to “weaponize winter.”\n\nSaturday's attack came the day after Russia bombarded Ukraine with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles overnight into Friday, according to Ukrainian officials, killing at least four people in the capital. For only the second time in the nearly 4-year-old war, it used a powerful new hypersonic missile that struck western Ukraine in a clear warning to Kyiv’s NATO allies.\n\nThe intense barrage and the launch of the nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile followed reports of major progress in talks between Ukraine and its allies on how to defend the country from further Moscow aggression if a U.S.-led peace deal is struck.\n\nStéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, said Friday's attacks “have resulted in significant civilian casualties and deprived millions of Ukrainians of essential services, including electricity, heating and water at a time of acute humanitarian need.”\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said heat supply would be fully restored in Kyiv by the end of Saturday.\n\nShe said areas on the right bank of the Dnieper River would gradually lift emergency blackouts and return to scheduled outages. But resuming power supply on the left bank, where Russian attacks were concentrated, is more complicated due to significant damage to the power grid, she added.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said Saturday that its forces used aviation, drones, missiles and artillery to strike Ukrainian energy facilities and fuel-storage depots.\n\nRussia struck Ukraine with 121 drones and one Iskander-M ballistic missile, according to the Ukrainian air force. It said 94 drones were shot down.\n\nSeparately, the Russian Defense Ministry said 59 Ukrainian drones were neutralized overnight over Russia and occupied Crimea.\n\nUkraine's military said that besides the oil depot in Volgograd, it had struck a drone storage facility belonging to a unit of Russia’s 19th Motor Rifle Division in Zaporizhzhia, southern Ukraine, as well as a drone command and control point near the eastern city of Pokrovsk.\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "First came Russia’s “turtle tank”, a metal shed rumbling across the battlefield. Then Ukraine laughed at the so-called “hairy tank”, coated in long, wavy metal wires.\n\nNow the “dandelion tank” has arrived.\n\nMoscow’s latest crude design, which features flexible metal rods arranged in branched layers, attempts to shield the body of the tank from the ever-present threat of small kamikaze drones.\n\nIt may look ridiculous, but analysts say the Oduvanchik (dandelion) anti-drone armour might offer the best protection currently available for the expensive vehicles.\n\nIt is the latest in a series of odd-looking Russian inventions that have appeared over the past week, each inspiring some level of mockery online. They include a camouflage net disguised as rubble and a patent for giant rotating propellers to protect Soviet-era vans.\n\nBut in such a protracted and largely static war, which demands endless innovation at cheaper and cheaper costs, any edge may save lives at the front.\n\nThe unorthodox dandelion-inspired modification was pictured for the first time last week, covering a Russian T-90M tank inside a warehouse. It is unclear when it will be deployed for combat, but Russia’s defence ministry recently patented the design.\n\nThe reinforced metal rods are welded together to form a tree-like structure that branches out into several tiers, forming a three-dimensional barrier, like the florets of a dandelion. In any gaps, a high-strength mesh is stretched between them.\n\nIf an explosive-rigged FPV (first-person-view) drone flies towards the tank, the rods should detonate it at a distance, shielding the hull from most of the blast. For every extra inch the drone is kept away, the tank has a better chance of survival.\n\nOn top of a T-90’s significant base armour, Russia often adds explosive reactive armour and metal cages. Pair this with the dandelion defence and “you’ve got the best passive anti-drone protection currently available,” David Axe, a military correspondent, wrote on his blog, Trench Art.\n\nIt is an upgrade of the “hedgehog” armour, of thick broom-like bristles protruding from a vehicle’s side, used across the front by Russian forces last year, and later by the Ukrainians.\n\n“At the front, anything you can experiment with, all different kinds of spikes, chains, cages, or a mixture of all, that can save the lives of soldiers is worth doing,” said David Kirichenko, a Ukraine-Russia weapons expert.\n\n“Ukrainian soldiers once mocked the Russians for putting cages on their vehicles; now they are doing it too,” he told The Telegraph.\n\nUkrainian forces were pictured earlier this week showing off a new design on a large infantry fighting vehicle that featured dandelion-like anti-drone armour, hair-like bristles, and metal sheets hanging from chains.\n\n“It is a part of [the] endless development of experimental and wacky inventions by both sides,” said Mr Kirichenko. “There is a constant race to identify weaknesses, produce measures and countermeasures and adapt to changing battlefield conditions.”\n\nYet, as with many other anti-drone systems, there are drawbacks. All the extra gear adds to the vehicle’s weight, slowing it down and leaving it more exposed to the drones that haunt the front.\n\nPlus, the dandelion armour is far from impregnable. Ukraine is proving increasingly efficient at flying drones beneath tanks and vehicles to strike them from below, where the armour is weakest, or to use FPVs to drop mines in their path.\n\nValerii Riabykh, a Ukrainian weapons analyst and editor of Defence Express, also pointed out how such protection was “ineffective against traditional weapons, such as an artillery shell, especially a high-precision one.”\n\nBut when it comes to drones, he said: “It may be effective for some time until the opposing side picks up the key to this protection, or breaks it.”\n\nIt can disguise gun, artillery or infantry positions underneath a rug of fake smashed-up bricks that look like rubble and rubbish, hiding equipment from Ukrainian drone operators.\n\nMr Riabykh said that, like the dandelion tank, it would probably only be useful for a limited time.\n\nWith the rise of AI and image processing tools installed within drones, its specific features could automatically highlight the nets to drone operators, he said, becoming an “unmasking feature which will lead to even faster destruction of those who use them”.\n\nAnother rudimentary tactic that emerged last week is the use of large propellers mounted on the roof, front, rear and sides of civilian vehicles used at the front.\n\nShort on modern armoured vehicles, Russia has for two years been using vans, trucks and jeeps for front-line tasks. Such unprotected vehicles are easy targets for Ukraine.\n\nAccording to a Russian patent, when the drone attempts to attack a protected vehicle, “there is a high probability that he will enter the rotation zone of one of the blades”.\n\nAnalysts The Telegraph spoke to largely dismissed such a design, owing to how much of the van is exposed and the fact that the propellers probably cost more than the vehicle they are intended to protect.\n\nYet any modifications, no matter how seemingly trivial, could allow either side to buy time, said Mr Riabykh, “and time on the modern battlefield is everything”.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "Russia said Friday it used its latest missile against Ukraine for a second time in the nearly 4-year-old war, a forceful signal to Kyiv and its Western allies as U.S.-led peace talks have entered a new and crucial stage.\n\nThe hypersonic Oreshnik intermediate range ballistic missile hit Ukraine's western Lviv region late Thursday night, although officials there did not mention any casualties. The area is near a military base in neighboring Poland, a NATO member, that serves as a key hub for ferrying Western military supplies to Kyiv.\n\nSome Moscow commentators said the attack was a warning to European leaders against proposals to deploy their troops to Ukraine as part of a prospective peace deal. Russia has said it won't accept such a deployment and would view those forces as legitimate targets.\n\nA look at the weapon and why Russia used it now:\n\nWhat’s known about the Oreshnik\n\nRussia first used the multiple-warhead Oreshnik on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro in November 2024.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin said the Oreshnik, which means “hazelnut tree” in Russian, streaks at 10 times the speed of sound, or Mach 10, “like a meteorite,” and was immune to any missile defense system.\n\nHe said the weapon is so powerful that several such missiles -- even fitted with conventional warheads — could be as devastating as a nuclear strike. He said it’s capable of destroying underground bunkers “three, four or more floors down.”\n\nThe Russian military said the Oreshnik can carry nuclear or conventional warheads and can reach any European target.\n\nThe Pentagon said the Oreshnik was an experimental type of intermediate-range ballistic missile, or IRBM, based on Russia’s RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. Intermediate-range missiles can fly between 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,400 miles). Such weapons were banned under a Soviet-era treaty that Washington and Moscow abandoned in 2019.\n\nWhen Russia first used the Oreshnik, Ukraine’s military said the missile had six independently targetable warheads, each carrying six submunitions.\n\nRussian military bloggers said the submunitions released by each warhead apparently were unarmed but had high kinetic energy estimated to deliver a destructive force equivalent to tons of explosives.\n\nSince the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia has used swarms of cheap slow-flying drones and an assortment of other missiles, but none had the range and power of Oreshnik.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said last month the Oreshnik had been deployed to Belarus and entered active service. It didn't specify how many missiles were sent to the key ally of Moscow and whether they were fitted with nuclear warheads, but Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that up to 10 Oreshnik systems will be stationed there.\n\nRussia previously has stationed tactical nuclear weapons inside Belarus, whose territory it used to launch the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn 2024, Putin released a revised nuclear doctrine that placed Belarus under Russia's atomic umbrella. The document significantly lowered the threshold for the possible use of nuclear weapons, declaring that any nation’s conventional attack on Russia that is supported by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack on the country. The threat was clearly aimed at discouraging the West from allowing Ukraine to strike Russia with longer-range weapons.\n\nUnlike Russia's other shorter-range conventional weapons, the Oreshnik is able to launch a powerful, conventional strike anywhere in Europe, giving the Kremlin a new instrument of escalation without tapping its nuclear arsenal. There will be no way to know whether the missile is carrying a nuclear or a conventional warhead before it hits the target.\n\nRussia's message by using the Oreshnik\n\nWhen Russia first used the Oreshnik, Putin described it as a response to Ukraine's Western allies allowing it to use their longer-range weapons to strike Russian territory.\n\nIts latest strike comes as the U.S.-led efforts to end the war in Ukraine have entered a pivotal stage and appears to underline Putin’s intention to negotiate from a position of strength as his troops make slow but steady territorial gains.\n\nSome Russian military bloggers noted that the strike in Lviv, not far from the Polish border, was a message intended for Kyiv’s allies. Those members of the “coalition of the willing” have proposed sending their troops to Ukraine as part of security guarantees once a peace deal is reached.\n\nRussia has said it won't accept any European forces in Ukraine, seeing them as legitimate targets.\n\n“For the first time, NATO command has been shown a strategic weapons strike virtually on its border,” said military expert Valery Shiryayev. “This action is intended to demonstrate the determination of Russia’s military and political leadership to use such weapons with nuclear warheads if necessary.”\n\nThe attack comes less than a week after the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a Russian ally. The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced the U.S. action as an act of aggression and sharply criticized Wednesday’s U.S. seizure of a Russia-flagged tanker.",

    "title": "Reports Of A Russian Weapon Aimed At Starlink Have Experts Shaking Their Heads",
    "description": "The Ukranian military has relied heavily on Starlink satellites for communications since Russia invaded in 2022, but this response seems implausible.",
    "fullText": "Even if you've never used the service you're likely familiar with Starlink, the global internet service provider that depends on an array of satellites in low-earth orbit (LEO). SpaceX launched the first Starlink satellites in 2019, and since them more than 9,000 more have joined those initial five dozen. Starlink plans an eventual fleet of over 40,000, but before that can happen Russia seems interested in knocking some of them out of commission.\n\nIn late December of 2025 the Associated Press reported that \"Two NATO-nation intelligence services suspect Russia is developing a new anti-satellite weapon to target Elon Musk's Starlink constellation.\" The unnamed services apparently said Russia wouldn't target satellites individually or with electromagnetic pulse devices but rather employ a \"zone-effect\" weapon consisting of a cloud of dense pellets. While any unsourced reports should be taken lightly, potential Russian interest in taking out Starlink satellites could be due to Ukraine's dependence on Starlink since Russia invaded in 2022. While anti-satellite weapons aren't new, they present significant risk in the form of widespread debris fields that could threaten other satellites.\n\nA \"zone effect\" weapon like the one mentioned is akin to firing a shotgun blast at the satellites, with one major difference. While shotgun pellets are limited by physics and gravity to a few seconds of flight, debris in space continues zipping around until it hits something or is captured by the earth's gravity field. The AP quoted defense expert Victoria Samson of the Secure World Foundation as saying \"I would be very surprised, frankly, if they were to do something like that.\" Brigadier General Christopher Horner — who commands the Space division of the Canadian military — wasn't so sure. After confirming that his intelligence services hadn't turned up any evidence of such a weapon, he added the caveat \"it's not implausible.\"\n\nStarlink satellites travel at 27,000 km/h (almost 17,000 mph) and orbit at 550 km (341.75 miles) above the earth. Hitting even a small object at that speed can cause catastrophic damage to the delicate structures and instruments on a satellite, and Starlink's aren't the only ones in low-earth orbit.\n\nNASA defines low-earth orbit as below 1,200 miles, noting that the International Space Station occupies this level of space and that it plans to expand access to \"include government agencies, commercial providers, academic organizations, and potentially more.\"\n\nDepoloying a \"zone-effect\" weapon like the one described in Associated Press' reporting would certainly cause indiscriminate damage to these satellites. The potential risks would be obvious to any rogue state on the planet, and Russia surely has scientists who understand them. Even if Russia never plans on developing or using such a device, it's possible this story has been fabricated and leaked to deter Starlink's operational support of Ukraine. Starlink is also providing internet service in Venezuela after U.S. military operations there, although that's only through February 3.\n\nZone-effect weapons are relatively low-tech, and Russia has a dedicated space launch agency with the ability to deploy much more capable anti-satellite weapons. Among the most powerful military air defense systems in the world is Russia's S-500 Prometheus, which can take out satellites in the near reaches of low-earth orbit. The S-500 was engineered as a defensive weapon, but it's not a huge leap in logic to imagine it being used in a \"zone effect\" or other attack on Starlink satellites.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin's launch of an Oreshnik hypersonic missile appears aimed at intimidating Ukraine and sending a signal of Russian military might to Europe and the United States at a crucial juncture in talks to end the war.\n\nPutin has repeatedly boasted of the speed and destructive power of the Oreshnik, which ​Russia first fired at Ukraine in November 2024. Since then, it has kept the weapon in reserve.\n\nThe overnight Oreshnik strike in western Ukraine came after a week of setbacks for Russia. ‌On Saturday, President Donald Trump sent U.S. special forces to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a close Putin ally, and on Wednesday U.S. forces seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the north Atlantic.\n\nOn Tuesday, Britain and France announced plans to deploy troops in Ukraine ‌in the event of a ceasefire - prompting Moscow to respond that it would view foreign soldiers as legitimate combat targets.\n\nGerhard Mangott, a Russia specialist at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, said Moscow was frustrated at being sidelined during weeks of diplomacy between the U.S., Ukraine and the Europeans, and \"particularly mad\" about the planned potential troop deployment by Kyiv's European allies. The use of the Oreshnik should be seen in that context, he said.\n\n\"It's a signal to the United States and the Europeans about the military capabilities of the Russian army,\" Mangott said in a telephone interview.\n\nHe said Moscow wanted to convey that \"Russia is to be taken seriously, given its military arsenal, ⁠and that the Europeans and Trump should return to a minimum of respect ‌for the Russian position in the negotiations.\"\n\n'DESTRUCTION NOT NECESSARILY THE GOAL'\n\nThe Oreshnik is capable of carrying nuclear as well as conventional warheads, although there was no suggestion of any nuclear component to the latest attack.\n\nA senior Ukrainian official told Reuters that the missile struck a state enterprise in the western city of Lviv and ‍was likely carrying inert or \"dummy\" warheads - as in 2024, when Russia first fired it to test the weapon in war.\n\n\"It does appear that at this point Russia is using Oreshnik for signaling purposes, so the destruction is not necessarily the goal,\" Pavel Podvig, director of the Russian Nuclear Forces Project, told Reuters when asked if the use of dummy warheads would diminish the capacity of Moscow's action to intimidate Ukraine and its allies.\n\n\"It's probably a general signal of resolve ​to escalate. My guess is that it will be read this way by the West,\" he said.\n\nWestern reaction to the attack, around 60 km (40 miles) from Ukraine's border with NATO member Poland, was swift. ‌The leaders of Britain, France and Germany called it \"escalatory and unacceptable\". European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said it was \"a clear escalation against Ukraine and meant as a warning to Europe and to the U.S.\".\n\nRUSSIAN STATEMENT ON REASON FOR MISSILE USE DRAWS SCEPTICISM\n\nRussia specialist Mangott was sceptical about the official statement from Russia's Defence Ministry that the Oreshnik launch was in response to an alleged Ukraine drone strike targeting one of Putin's residences, in the northern region of Novgorod, late last month. Ukraine has denied any such attack took place, accusing Moscow of lying about it in order to derail peace talks.\n\nSeveral high-profile Russian war bloggers also criticised the official framing of the strike as a revenge attack. One, Yuri Baranchik, suggested it would have \"looked more convincing\" if Moscow had fired the missile at President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's bunker in Kyiv.\n\nMick Ryan, ⁠an Australian military expert, linked the weapon's use to Russia's recent setbacks, especially over Venezuela.\n\nHe said the point was \"to demonstrate ​that Russia remains a nuclear-armed world power. In this guise, it is a psychological weapon – an instrument of Putin’s cognitive war ​against Ukraine and the West – rather than a weapon of mass physical destruction.\"\n\nRussian arch-hawk Dmitry Medvedev, a former president who is now deputy chairman of Putin's Security Council, alluded in a social media post to the capture of Maduro, the oil tanker seizure by the U.S. and the possibility of further U.S. sanctions against Russia, which he ‍said had made for a \"stormy\" start to the year.\n\nIn ⁠comments highly critical of Washington, he said international relations had descended into a madhouse and compared the Oreshnik strike to \"a life-saving injection of haloperidol\", an anti-psychotic drug.\n\nProminent Russian war blogger Fighterbomber, a former military serviceman, said he thought the use of the Oreshnik was a display of power to convey a message and that Moscow would not be resorting to it often.\n\nHe noted that ⁠some Oreshnik systems had been transferred to Belarus and that Russia would have some of its own in reserve, but suggested that there was not an endless supply of the relatively new missile.\n\n\"Taking all these constants into account, we can assume that ‌we can afford to conduct such demonstrations two or three times a year,\" he wrote.\n\nHe expressed hope that no further launches would be needed for now, concluding: \"The signals have ‌been sent and they have been heard.\"",

    "fullText": "ROME, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Europe should reopen dialogue with Russia, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on Friday, adding that it was far too soon to ​discuss welcoming Moscow back into the Group of Eight leading nations.\n\nMeloni said she ‌agreed with French President Emmanuel Macron, who recently called for Europe to engage with Moscow as efforts continue to ‌end the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"I think Macron is right on this. I believe the time has come for Europe to also speak with Russia,\" she said at her traditional New Year's press conference.\n\n\"Because if Europe decides to take part in this phase of negotiations by talking only to ⁠one of the two sides, I ‌fear that in the end the positive contribution it can make will be limited,\" she added.\n\nTalks to bring the almost four-year war to an ‍end have accelerated since November. However, Moscow has yet to signal willingness to make concessions after Kyiv pushed for changes to a U.S. proposal that initially backed Russia's main demands.\n\nMoscow has also given no ​public sign that it would accept a peace deal with the security guarantees envisaged ‌by Ukraine's allies, including having Western troops inside Ukraine.\n\nMeloni said the European Union should appoint an envoy to deal directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin and avoid confusion.\n\n\"If we were to make the mistake of deciding, on the one hand, to reopen dialogue with Russia, and on the other, to proceed in a disorganised way, we would be doing Putin a favour,\" ⁠she said. \"We have had this problem from the start. ​Too many voices speaking, too many formats,\" she added.\n\nAmong ​proposals put forward by the United States in November was for Russia to be readmitted to the Group of Seven wealthy nations club, reviving the ‍now-defunct G8.\n\nMeloni said it ⁠was \"absolutely premature\" to talk about welcoming Russia back into the G7 fold. She also reiterated that Italy had no intention of sending troops to Ukraine to help guarantee ⁠any peace deal.\n\nFrance and Britain last month signed a declaration of intent on the future deployment of multinational ‌forces into Ukraine once a ceasefire is reached.",

    "title": "Ukraine's top general says that drones are now taking out Russia's soldiers as fast as it gets new ones into battle",
    "description": "Ukraine's commander in chief said December was the first month that its drones \"neutralized\" roughly as many Russians as were called up.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's top general said that for the first time in the war, its drones are killing or seriously wounding Russia's soldiers as fast as it can get new troops into the field.\n\nDrones are the top battlefield threat, responsible for the most casualties in this war. Ukraine relies heavily on them, especially the cheap first-person-view drones, as solutions to its manpower and equipment shortages.\n\nUkraine's commander in chief, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Tuesday in a Telegram post that December was the first month in which Ukraine's uncrewed systems units \"neutralized\" about as many Russian servicemen as it called up in a month.\n\nHe said video confirmed 33,000 Russian losses last month. \"The real losses of the occupiers are greater,\" the general said.\n\nSyrskyi did not provide a number for the number of Russian soldiers called up. Business Insider is unable to independently confirm Syrskyi's claims.\n\nRussia hasn't provided official casualty figures. As for the number of new Russian soldiers sent to Ukraine each month, a US assessment put the number around 30,000 last April. In May, however, the Russian president said that the number was twice that. A Ukrainian intelligence assessment in December said that Russia fulfilled its 2025 mobilization target of 403,000, an average of more than 36,000 a month.\n\nRussia's armed forces in Ukraine are a mixed bag of contract soldiers who volunteer for the fight — Russia attracts volunteers with various perks, like signing bonuses — conscripts pulled in through draft cycles, and other sources. Russia has previously recruited people out of its prisons.\n\nThough exact losses are unclear, Ukrainian and Western intel assessments point to substantial attrition. Russia has a much larger population to draw soldiers from than Ukraine, which is also said to have suffered significant losses in this war. Some estimates put Russian losses at 1,000 troops a day.\n\nWhile Russia has a larger population to pull from, it has tried to avoid repeated large-scale involuntary mobilizations.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin publicly promised not to send conscripts to the front lines, fearing fallout. It has limited what Russia can do with them, even though widespread reporting and captured conscripts say assurances have been misleading.\n\nSyrskyi called 2025 a great breakthrough for Ukraine's drone war and pledged that it would not stop, with plans to grow capabilities further in 2026.\n\nHe said that in December, the number of targets that were hit or destroyed by drones rose by 31% and that the number of Russian personnel hit rose by more than 25%.\n\nSyrskyi said in November that uncrewed systems were responsible for about 60 % of all enemy targets hit. That figure has also been higher, at times, in front-line areas.\n\nDrones directly attack troops and equipment — either by carrying explosives or dropping weapons like grenades — and they also collect intelligence that shapes how armies employ other forces. Even inexpensive drones have had an outsized impact, destroying sophisticated, multimillion-dollar systems such as tanks.\n\nRussia and Ukraine are locked in a drone development race to field greater numbers and more advanced drones, as well as counter-drone technology.\n\nSyrskyi warned that Russia also has ambitious plans for its drones. He said that Russia copied Ukraine by creating a separate part of the military for uncrewed systems and said that it has 80,000 servicemen. He said Russia plans to expand that to 165,500 this year and to almost 210,000 by 2030.\n\nThere are so many drones in the sky that Ukrainian soldiers previously told Business Insider that they were sometimes unable to tell which side any belonged to and would instead try to bring them all down just to be on the safe side.",

    "fullText": "The lightning U.S. operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro can be seen as both a benefit and a burden for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose forces botched an attempt to capture Ukraine’s capital and topple its leader at the start of Moscow's invasion nearly four years ago.\n\nThe ouster of Maduro highlights another Kremlin failure to support an ally, following the downfall of Syria’s former President Bashar Assad in 2024 and last year’s U.S. and Israeli attacks on Iran. With the U.S. determined to establish control over Venezuela, Russia stands to lose a strategic foothold in the Western Hemisphere, along with billions of dollars invested in its oil industry.\n\nBut President Donald Trump's actions in Venezuela also are causing unease in Western nations and giving the Kremlin fresh talking points to defend its war in Ukraine.\n\nIn addition, Trump’s interest in wresting control of Greenland from NATO ally Denmark also threatens to destabilize the alliance at the moment when the U.S.-led efforts to broker peace in Ukraine enter a pivotal stage, distracting its members from their efforts to support Kyiv and provide it with security guarantees.\n\nPutin himself hasn’t commented on the U.S. actions in Venezuela, which his diplomats have denounced as a blatant act of aggression. Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president who serves as his deputy on the presidential Security Council, similarly rebuked Washington for trampling international law — but also complimented Trump on defending U.S. interests.\n\n“Even though Trump’s action is completely unlawful, he cannot be denied a certain consistency — he and his team are very aggressively upholding their country’s national interests,” Medvedev said.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. said it seized two sanctioned oil tankers linked to Venezuela, including one flagged to Russia in the North Atlantic.\n\nMoscow's ‘spheres of influence’\n\nSince 2014's illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula that followed the ouster of a pro-Kremlin president in Kyiv, Putin has sought to justify his action by describing his neighbor as part of Russia’s sphere of influence where Western encroachment can’t be allowed.\n\nPutin has argued that just as the U.S. would bristle at any foreign military presence in the Western Hemisphere, Russia sees NATO’s expansion to its borders as a major security threat. He cited Ukraine’s bid to join the military alliance as a key reason behind his full-scale invasion of the country.\n\n“We have made it clear and unambiguous that further eastward expansion of NATO is unacceptable,” Putin said shortly before sending troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. “Are we the ones placing missiles near the U.S. borders? No, it’s the U.S. that has brought its missiles to our doorstep.”\n\nLong before the invasion, Russia tested the ground on a possible deal under which it would refrain from meddling in Latin America in exchange for the U.S. offering Moscow free rein in Europe.\n\nFiona Hill, who oversaw Russia and Europe on Trump's National Security Council during his first term, testified before Congress in 2019 that the Russians were signaling their willingness to make such an arrangement involving Venezuela and Ukraine.\n\nRussia never made a formal offer, Hill told The Associated Press in an interview, but Moscow’s then-ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, “hinted ... many times” to her that Russia could cede its influence in Venezuela to the U.S. in exchange for a sphere of influence in Europe.\n\nShe said Trump's administration wasn’t interested in the Russian overtures that she described as a “hint-hint, nudge-nudge, wink-wink, how-about-doing-a-deal” offer. In April 2019, Hill was sent to Moscow to convey the message that “nobody’s interested. ... Ukraine and Venezuela are not related to each other.”\n\nHill said she did not know if the winds have now changed and whether there was any deal between the U.S. and Russia to swap spheres of influence in Venezuela and Ukraine, but she noted that many officials, including herself, who were involved in “restraining” Trump in his first term aren't around for his second.\n\nShe argued that U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio would likely be the only member of the Trump administration who would now resist such a proposal, but added that others, including Trump envoy Steve Witkoff, could have a different view.\n\n“Who knows what Witkoff and others have been chatting about recently?” Hill asked.\n\nBefore Maduro was captured, AP reported Russia had started evacuating families of diplomats from Venezuela. When asked about the move, Hill said it would not be “implausible” that Witkoff gave Moscow a “courtesy heads-up.”\n\nSam Greene, a Russia expert at King’s College London, observed that Moscow may have backed down on Venezuela in the expectation of the U.S. giving it a free hand on Ukraine.\n\n“My worry is that it may be part of a tacit agreement, by which Washington, Moscow and Beijing agree not to deter one another against interventions in their putative spheres of influence,” he wrote on X.\n\nRussia’s foothold in Western Hemisphere\n\nBefore the invasion of Ukraine, senior Russian officials had issued vague warnings that Moscow could deploy troops or military assets to Cuba and Venezuela — statements that the U.S. dismissed as bluster. Some drew parallels to the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis — when the Soviet Union deployed missiles to Cuba and the U.S. imposed a naval blockade of the island.\n\nRussian-Cuban ties withered after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, plunging Cuba into a grueling depression. Soon after his first election in 2000, Putin ordered the closure of a Soviet-built military surveillance facility in Cuba as he sought to improve ties with Washington. As tensions with the U.S. and its allies mounted, however, Moscow again intensified trade and other contacts with Cuba and sent warships to visit the island.\n\nRussia also has invested heavily in Venezuela's oil industry, as did China, and offered Caracas generous loans to purchase top-of-the-line air defense missiles, fighter jets and other weapons. On several occasions, most recently in 2018, it dispatched its nuclear-capable Tu-160 bombers to Venezuela in a projection of force.\n\nMilitary experts have said, however, that any attempt by Russia to establish a permanent military foothold in the Western Hemisphere would face overwhelming logistical challenges.\n\nThe ‘might-makes-right’ doctrine\n\nThe U.S. seizure of Maduro and his wife was seen worldwide as the return of the “might- makes-right” doctrine, backing Moscow’s argument that its action in Ukraine protects its vital interests the way the U.S. did in Venezuela.\n\nAfter its action in Venezuela, the U.S. has “nothing to formally reproach our country for,” Medvedev noted.\n\nHill noted that Maduro’s capture makes it harder for countries to condemn Russia’s action in Ukraine because “we’ve just had a situation where the U.S. has taken over — or at least decapitated the government of another country — using fiction.”\n\nAn indictment accuses Maduro and others of working with drug cartels to facilitate the shipment of thousands of tons of cocaine into the U.S.\n\nFyodor Lukyanov, a Kremlin-connected, Moscow-based foreign policy expert, observed that “if we consider what’s happening from the perspective of setting a precedent, then we couldn’t ask for anything better, and this includes Trump’s conviction that the authorities in Venezuela must be approved by Washington.”\n\nRussian hawks, meanwhile, argue the U.S. action in Venezuela has created a new sense of urgency for Moscow to dramatically speed up its offensive in Ukraine.\n\n“Ukraine under our full control is our pass to the Great Powers club,” Alexander Dugin, a hard-line nationalist ideologue, wrote in a commentary.\n\nAP European Security Correspondent Emma Burrows in London contributed.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is now on board with a hard-hitting sanctions package meant to economically cripple Moscow as his administration continues to negotiate a deal to end the war that began with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he met with Trump at the White House earlier Wednesday, during which the president “greenlit” the Russia sanctions bill that has been in the works for months.\n\nGraham had signaled previously that Trump has blessed the bill, only for it to encounter additional obstacles. But a White House official confirmed to The Associated Press Wednesday that the president supports the sanctions legislation.\n\n“This will be well-timed, as Ukraine is making concessions for peace and Putin is all talk, continuing to kill the innocent,” Graham said in a statement, referring to the Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe bill, chiefly written by Graham and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., allows the administration to impose tariffs and secondary sanctions on countries that purchase Russia’s oil, gas, uranium and other exports. Doing so is meant to cut off the source of financing for much of Russia’s military actions.\n\nThe White House has previously insisted on some revisions and flexibility for Trump in the sanctions package, but the White House official on Wednesday did not elaborate on whether any changes were secured.\n\nThe legislation has dozens of co-sponsors in the Senate, as well as a companion bill in the House, drafted by Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa.\n\nGraham said there could be a vote as early as next week, although it’s unclear how likely that will be. The Senate is poised to take up a scaled-back government funding package next week that the House is currently considering, if the House passes it. The following week is a Senate recess timed to Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n\nThe Trump administration is currently trying to finalize a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, now nearly four years old, with special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, as the U.S. president’s chief negotiators.",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces used long-range, deep-strike drones to hit a Russian missile arsenal and oil depot supporting the invasion, a security official told Business Insider on Tuesday.\n\nThe attacks mark Ukraine's latest deep strikes as it continues to target Russian weapons and the country's vast energy sector, a major revenue source for the state as it wages war.\n\nA source in the Security Service of Ukraine, the SBU, said that drones hit Russia's 100th Main Missile and Artillery Directorate (GRAU) in the western Kostroma region. They were only authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss military developments.\n\nThe drone attack on the facility triggered a secondary detonation of ammunition, causing powerful blasts at the facility, the source said, calling it an important target because Russia uses it to supply munitions to smaller sites in other areas of the country.\n\nThe source said drones also struck an oil depot in the nearby Lipetsk region, sparking an \"intense\" blaze. Video footage and images shared on social media appeared to show fire and smoke at the two facilities.\n\nOvernight, Ukrainian attack drones successfully hit a Russian oil depot in the town of Usman, Lipetsk Oblast. Seen here, flames leap into the night sky from the burning facility. pic.twitter.com/EN6SRI2sXU\n\nRussia's defense ministry said on Tuesday that it shot down 360 Ukrainian drones without specifying where. Neither the ministry nor the Russian embassy in the US responded to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nThe SBU source said that the two drone attacks were carried out by its Alpha group, an elite \"spetsnaz\" unit considered to be among the best of Ukraine's special forces.\n\nThe Alpha group regularly carries out long-range drone attacks against Russian targets, including a recent first-of-its-kind strike on a Moscow-linked oil tanker in the Mediterranean Sea and the stunning June attacks against Russian airbases, known as Operation Spiderweb.\n\nThe SBU's Alpha forces also carry out ground operations; for instance, they have participated in Ukraine's defense of Pokrovsk, the war-torn city in the eastern Donetsk region that has been the site of some of the conflict's most intense fighting.\n\n\"In the New Year, the SBU continues to work successfully on military and oil facilities of the Russian Federation, reducing the enemy's ability to provide their army with ammunition and fuel,\" the source said in translated remarks shared with Business Insider.\n\n\"All Russian rear facilities that work for the war against Ukraine are absolutely legitimate targets,\" they added.\n\nSince August, Ukraine has stepped up its use of long-range drones to attack Russian energy facilities in a bid to put pressure on a key source of revenue for Moscow that helps fuel its war efforts.\n\nUkraine has mostly targeted oil and gas infrastructure on land, such as depots and ports, but in recent weeks, it has expanded attacks to maritime targets, striking several oil tankers and oil platforms in the Black, Caspian, and Mediterranean seas.\n\nUkrainian officials have described the deep-strike operations as the country's way of imposing \"long-range\" sanctions on Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, Tuesday's attack on the 100th GRAU arsenal reflects a tactic that Ukraine has long relied on — hitting ammunition storage sites inside Russia to cause more near-term battlefield impacts.",

    "title": "Russian Shahed-136 Kamikaze Drones Now Carrying MANPADS Missiles",
    "description": "The Shahed-136 is now toting a shoulder-fired heat seeking missile as Russia continues to expand the drone’s capabilities.",
    "fullText": "Russia is continuing to adapt and evolve its copies of the Shahed-136 long-range one-way attack drone, known locally as the Geran, now arming it with a man-portable air defense system (MANPADS). These are more often referred to as shoulder-fired heat-seeking missiles. The development follows a previous version of the drone carrying a single R-60 air-to-air missile, which you can read more about here. It also emerges as Russia makes additional alterations to the drone, including improved line-of-sight control capabilities and self-protection systems.\n\nRussian forces are mounting Igla MANPADS on Shahed drones to target Ukrainian helicopters that intercept them. The drones carry a camera and radio modem, and the missile is launched remotely by an operator in Russian territory. pic.twitter.com/T5TKPHyhVu\n\n— WarTranslated (@wartranslated) January 4, 2026\n\nAn example of a MANPADS-equipped Shahed/Geran is seen in recent imagery, including a video, that shows the drone lying in the snow, after it came down intact in Ukraine, reportedly in the Chernihiv region in the north of the country. According to Ukrainian accounts, as well as the rail-mounted missile on the top, the drone is equipped with a camera and a radio-frequency modem.\n\nThe missile itself has been widely reportedly as an Igla-S, among the latest models of this widespread MANPADS. Known in Russia as the 9K388, and to NATO as the SA-24 Grinch, the weapon has a maximum range of around 3.7 miles, and improvements over earlier Igla missiles include a more sensitive infrared seeker, a heavier warhead, and an improved fuze.\n\nOn the other hand, the inscription on the top of the launch tube appears to read 9K333, which would indicate it is the more modern Verba (SA-29 Gizmo), which was developed as a replacement for the Igla. Its primary advantage is its advanced multispectral seeker, operating in the ultraviolet, near infrared, and mid-infrared bands, for improved discrimination between targets and decoys.\n\nAdapting the MANPADS to the Shahed/Geran appears more straightforward than the R-60, with no need for the launch rail adapter; instead, the MANPADS is simply attached to the drone within its standard launch tube. The complete Igla, for example, is also much lighter: around 40 pounds in its tube, compared to close to 100 pounds for the R-60, minus the launch rail.\n\nInterception of the Russian Shahed kamikaze drone with an installed R-60 air-to-air missile. \n\nIt was intercepted by Darknode unit of the @usf_army, using STING anti-Shahed drone developed by the @wilendhornets and funded by @sternenkofund. https://t.co/XHEjuCP31F pic.twitter.com/oje4VOXTbz\n\n(@bayraktar_1love) December 1, 2025\n\nRussia started employing Shahed/Geran-type long-range UAVs equipped with air-to-air missiles for combating Ukrainian aviation assets, Ukrainian military radio technology expert Serhii Flash reports.\n\nThe remains of a Shahed/Geran-type drone with an R-60 short-range air-to-air… pic.twitter.com/NHBDQQqCK9\n\n— Status-6 (War & Military News) (@Archer83Able) December 1, 2025\n\nAs for the drone, the original Shahed-136 is Iranian in origin. Multiple variants and derivatives of the Shahed-136, including a jet-powered type, are now produced in large numbers in Russian factories, where they are known locally by the name Geran, the Russian word for geranium. Steady improvements have been made to these drones, including a degree of dynamic targeting capability, as you can read about here.\n\nAs we have discussed in the past, adding a heat-seeking anti-aircraft missile to the Shahed/Geran in theory provides the drone with a means to engage Ukrainian fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. At the very least, giving the drone the ability to hit back at these threats offers a deterrent capability. Overall, the effectiveness of this combination is questionable. Particular challenges include the need for a high degree of situational awareness, perhaps requiring cameras around the airframe, and the need to maneuver the drone to get it into a boresight location to achieve a lock-on. However, Russia clearly considers that the adaptation is worth exploring, even just as a deterrent strategy to keep drone hunting aircraft at bay.\n\nFor some time now, Russia has been working on a man-in-the-loop (MITL) control capability for the Shahed/Geran, a feature that was confirmed when they started to appear with cameras and cellular modems, something TWZ explored in detail at the time. These developments allow the drone to be connected to an operator. Standard Shaheds fly autonomous routes to pre-planned targets on autopilot with no man-in-the-loop control. They are ‘fire and forget’ weapons.\n\nMeanwhile, the range at which MITL can be achieved has been steadily increased. At first, the drones were adapted to exploit patchy cellular networks to provide additional connectivity when available. More recently, Shaheds have been flying with antennas allowing for direct line-of-sight control close to the front lines. This allows them to hit targets dynamically like an FPV drone, while packing a much heavier punch and being able to loiter for long periods of time. You can read all about this development here. Now, the datalink range is being extended using airborne signal relays, possibly creating a mesh network with multiple line-of-sight links. We are also now seeing Russian drones will Starlink terminals, which could provide a vastly superior beyond-line-of-sight capability and could prove to be a big problem for Ukraine if Russia can produce such a configuration in large volumes. These developments are now blurring the classification of the Shahed/Geran from its original long-range one-way attack drone to a loitering munition, with an onboard imaging capability.\n\nA Russian Molniya drone with a Starlink terminal.https://t.co/9Tb8GTx1nI pic.twitter.com/zmbpgMGwXm\n\n— Rob Lee (@RALee85) December 15, 2025\n\nPotentially, a Shahed/Geran armed with a MANPADS or an R-60 could use beyond-line-of-sight capabilities to operate the missile. But bearing in mind we know Russia is using the drones closer to the front lines, this would need only a line-of-sight link with operators near the front, or at least by receivers/transmitters placed there. Drone controllers behind the lines could also ‘pick them up’ once in the area, but such an operation is far more complex and fraught with additional risks.\n\nNew article: Networking the Shahed \n\nHow Russia’s datalink-enabled Geran-2s are evolving beyond the traditional one-way attack UAV concept.https://t.co/HluZ7dDulH pic.twitter.com/ZqXpAl2NiC\n\n— Fabian Hinz (@fab_hinz) January 4, 2026\n\nNevertheless, target acquisition and engagement of a missile-armed drone is still far from straightforward. It’s likely that the modern seeker used by the Igla-S or Verba makes it easier to engage aerial targets, compared to the R-60, with a reduced need to ‘point’ the drone directly at the target. Still, the operator would have to trigger the launch of the missile after receiving the signal indicating a lock-on has been achieved.\n\nAt the same time, the Shahed/Geran remains a slow and not particularly agile launch platform, and certainly not one that was designed with air-to-air combat in mind. Adding a top-mounted missile likely also degrades its maneuverability and affects its stability, but less than would be the case with an R-60.\n\nWhen it comes to finding aerial targets, the most likely scenario involves operating entirely reactively to what is seen visually on cameras around the drone or otherwise searching for targets of opportunity. Another option would involve the drone operator receiving target information from offboard assets, where applicable, but this seems less likely.\n\nBearing in mind the performance of the Shahed/Geran and the range of the MANPADS, the most likely targets would be the Mi-8/Mi-17 Hip series armed transport helicopters and the Mi-24 Hind series gunships that are routinely tasked with counter-drone missions. We have already seen that lower and slower-flying helicopters face a notable risk from relatively small kamikaze drones that simply fly into them. Ukrainian F-16s, MiG-29s, Su-27s and Mirage 2000s have also been tasked heavily as ‘Shahed hunters,’ but engaging fighters with these weapons would be even tougher. Still their very existence would add a credible threat to fighters approaching them.\n\nFootage showing the door gunner on a Mil Mi-8 Multirole Helicopter with the Ukrainian Air Force using his M134 Minigun to shoot down a Russian Shahed-136 Attack Drone. pic.twitter.com/UWBd8QUXEf\n\n— OSINTdefender (@sentdefender) November 12, 2025\n\nWhile it remains to be seen just how effective the combination of Shahed/Geran with a MANPADS (or R-60) is, these developments reflect a previous precedent for arming drones with air-to-air missiles. The deterrent effect of this can be seen in at least one instance from 2002, when a U.S. Air Force MQ-1 Predator drone fired a Stinger heat-seeking anti-air missile at an Iraqi MiG-25 Foxbat fighter that was trying to shoot it down, which can be seen in the video below.\n\nThese measures are also indicative of efforts being made by Russia to better defend the Shahed/Geran drones. Another recent development involves the apparent addition of infrared countermeasures to defeat drone interceptors and possible missiles fired by fighters. Attached to the rear of the drone’s stabilizing endplates, these appear to employ electrically heated cylindrical blocks to generate blooming infrared energy, like the Hot Brick system.\n\nUkrainian military radio technology specialist and consultant Serhii “Flash” Beskrestnov reported that Russian Geran-2 drones are now capable of blinding interceptor drones and aircraft. \n\nAccording to him, the Russians are equipping their strike UAVs with infrared searchlights.… pic.twitter.com/dtpnbKIklE\n\n— OSINTWarfare (@OSINTWarfare) January 3, 2026\n\nFor now, we have no evidence of a missile-equipped Shahed/Geran attempting to engage a Ukrainian aircraft, let alone bringing one down. However, having long-range one-way attack drones fitted with air defense missiles provides another complicating factor for Ukraine and illustrates the continued modifications being made to these weapons.\n\nContact the author: thomas@thewarzone.com",

    "description": "The push for tax collection comes as Russia's growth has slowed to a near standstill nearly four years after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
    "fullText": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered a \"significant increase\" in tax collection and compliance this year as Russia's wartime economy continues to lose momentum.\n\nThe Kremlin announced the directive on Saturday following an early December meeting of the Council for Strategic Development and National Projects.\n\nA share of that increase is set to come from higher consumption taxes, which rose from 20% to 22% on January 1. This bump is expected to generate about 1 trillion rubles, or $12.3 billion, in tax revenues.\n\nRussia is also planning to introduce a new tax on electronics in September.\n\nThe push for more aggressive tax collection comes as Russia's growth has slowed to a near standstill nearly four years after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWhile Russia's sanctions-hit wartime economy appeared resilient in the first years of the war, cracks are emerging as persistently low oil prices are taking a toll.\n\nIn November, GDP expanded by just 0.1% from a year ago, according to official data. Industrial output declined 0.7%.\n\nIn the third quarter, Russia's GDP grew 0.6% from a year ago — sharply lower than the 1.1% in the second quarter and 1.4% in the first.\n\nPutin has also ordered officials to restore economic growth and investment activity, while addressing structural problems across key sectors of the economy.\n\nAt the same time, the government is expected to keep inflation in check, with the target rate by the end of 2026 set within the central bank's forecast range of 4% to 5% — down from below 6% expected in 2025 and 9.5% in 2024.\n\nOil prices fell 20% in 2025 due to ample supply and slowing demand growth.\n\nDevelopments in the global oil market could add to that pressure. The US raid on Venezuela over the weekend is set to change the calculus for energy markets.\n\n\"Big Short\" investor Michael Burry wrote on Monday that Russian oil \"just became less important\" in the mid- to long-term. He said tapping Venezuelan oil could strengthen the US and \"reduce Russia's income and power.\"\n\nThat view was echoed by John E. Herbst, the senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center and a former US ambassador to Ukraine, who pointed to President Donald Trump's plans for Venezuelan oil.\n\n\"Trump has said he intends to put Venezuelan oil — still under tough sanctions — back on the market,\" wrote Herbst on Monday.\n\n\"While this may take some time, it will help him reach his goal of driving down oil prices for US (and therefore global) consumers. This will be another big hit to the Russian economy,\" he added.\n\nVenezuela holds some of the world's largest oil reserves. But analysts say reviving the country's oil industry could take years due to aging infrastructure, decades of under-investment, sanctions, and political instability.",

    "fullText": "Michael Burry says the US raid on Venezuela is a much bigger deal than the markets' muted reaction suggests.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame, who recently pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack, published a post early Monday saying the \"game just changed\" in the mid to long term, and \"markets are not pricing in all that may come of this weekend's events.\"\n\n\"This is a paradigm shift despite the markets yawning,\" he later wrote on X.\n\nBenchmark oil prices climbed less than 1% on Monday, and US stock futures opened higher, after the US captured President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend and President Trump said America would \"run\" the oil-rich country for the time being.\n\nThe seizure was a \"shot across China's bow,\" Burry wrote, pointing to billions of dollars in loans that China has made to Venezuela under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which were collateralized using future oil output that is \"now in US hands.\"\n\nThe investor, who shot to fame after his prescient bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble was featured in the book and movie \"The Big Short,\" wrote that China may now have a \"blueprint\" for how to take control of Taiwan, but \"must be in awe of Trumpian America's infuriating gall and decisive power.\"\n\nBurry said that China stocks strike him as \"somewhat riskier\" now in terms of running afoul of sanctions. He wrote that Alibaba, Baidu, and other potential sanction targets \"could be in for some volatility\" if China escalates its aggression in the South China Sea or targets Taiwan.\n\nThe contrarian bargain hunter also wrote that \"Putin's jaw has to be on the floor\" after the US did in \"practically seconds\" what Russia has been trying to do in Ukraine for three years.\n\nHe added that Russian oil \"just became less important\" in the mid to long term, as tapping Venezuelan oil could strengthen the US and \"reduce Russia's income and power.\"\n\nBurry also suggested that Canada and Mexico could \"lose a good amount of leverage\" in trade with the US if American refineries switch out Canadian crude for Venezuelan oil.\n\nThe veteran investor also said US oil-services companies such as Halliburton, Schlumberger, and Baker Hughes \"should benefit significantly\" as US contractors will be tasked with fixing and modernizing Venezuela's pipelines and refineries.\n\nBurry also forecast a \"long term tailwind\" for the US as inflows of Venezuelan oil will mean gas, diesel, and jet fuel prices will drop. He said that could push down prices to the benefit of consumers, especially lower-income ones, cut supply chain costs, and ease some uncertainty about the future for business owners.",

    "description": "The UK military expected to see more high-end Russian equipment, like T-14s and Su-57s, in Ukraine, an officer said. They're not there though.",
    "fullText": "A British Army officer said that the military was surprised it did not see more advanced Russian weaponry, like some of its best tanks, on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\n\"We probably would've expected to have seen more of their prestige equipment,\" Maj. Maguire told Business Insider, speaking on the condition that only his rank and last name be used. He previously helped lead the UK-led training for Ukrainian soldiers and also produced reports for the UK and allies on tactics in Ukraine and the lessons Western forces could draw from them.\n\nOne example he gave of Russian equipment that hasn't been seen is the T-14, considered Russia's most advanced tank.\n\nThat kind of warfighting equipment is what the British military sort of sees as \"the pacing threat equipment that we train against.\"\n\nThe T-14, estimated to cost between $5 million and $9 million, is regarded as one of Russia's best tanks. Western analysts had worried the tanks might rival NATO's most advanced tanks. Russian state media has often touted the Armata as \"cutting edge.\"\n\nYet these weapons haven't been seen in the war. Sergei Chemezov, the CEO of Rostec, which produces the Armata, previously said the tanks might not be well-suited for Ukraine.\n\n\"Armata is, in general, a little expensive,\" he said. \"In terms of functionality, it is, of course, much superior to existing tanks, but it is too expensive, so the army is unlikely to use it now.\"\n\nThe UK expected this kind of prestige equipment, but instead these tanks \"haven't really been used, and I think that's probably more surprising than the fact that they've used a lot of their stockpiles and stuff,\" Maguire said.\n\nThe Russians have relied heavily on tanks like T-90s and T-80s, as well as some decades-old equipment, some first deployed in the 1940s. It has been pulling old tanks out of storage rather than putting its most capable assets, at least on paper, out onto the battlefield.\n\nIts stores are vast, with numerous tanks built for a Cold War fight, and building new tanks is a long process, even with Russia's ramped-up defense industry output. Sophisticated machinery takes time to build, and the Western sanctions at crippling the industry don't make it any easier.\n\nMaguire did not speculate on why Russia is not using the T-14, but the UK Ministry of Defence has previously weighed in.\n\nIt said last year that the Armata's absence was \"highly likely due to the potential reputational damage of losing the 'prestige' vehicle in combat and the requirement to produce greater quantities of MBTs which can only be satisfied by other variants.\"\n\nAn earlier ministry intelligence update that Russian troops in Ukraine were reluctant to accept the first tranche of T-14s that were offered to them \"because the vehicles were in such poor condition.\"\n\nRussia's confidence in the tank is unclear; however, it notably reduced its own order for the tanks, instead focusing on modernizing older types. Western analyses say the tank is impressive but also appears to be more vulnerable than Russia has said.\n\nThe war has not been kind to tanks and other armored vehicles. It is a fight in which neither side has achieved air superiority and cheap drones and mines threaten anything that moves. Considering the substantial losses, cost-effective mass has often proven more valuable than exquisite combat power.\n\nBeyond the T-14, Russia also hasn't sent in its fifth-generation fighters, its Su-57s. These aircraft are built for this kind of war, where air defenses make the skies extremely dangerous for older fourth-gen jets. Russia hasn't made the progress it hoped for in Ukraine, yet these planes are still largely sitting out the fight.\n\nThe UK defense ministry said in 2023 that the Su-57's usage seemed limited to Russian territory and launching long-range air-to-surface or air-to-air missiles into Ukraine. It said Russia was \"highly likely prioritising avoiding the reputational damage, reduced export prospects, and the compromise of sensitive technology which would come from any loss\" of the jet over Ukraine.\n\nQuestions have been raised about the Su-57 stealth and combat capabilities, with some speculation that it may not be a true fifth-gen aircraft. A former UK air force officer turned analyst previously told Business Insider that Russia was likely saving them for a possible conflict with NATO.\n\nWhen it comes to the high-level equipment Russia isn't using, Maguire said, \"I have no idea why they're not using it, but I'm pretty sure whatever it is, we could defeat it with what we have.\"\n\nRussia has put some advanced systems into the war; however, the few weapons that have made an appearance haven't \"performed very well,\" the major said.\n\nHe pointed to Ukraine's destruction of Russia's newly developed BMPT \"Terminator\", a 23-foot-long armored vehicle carrying a host of weapons. Ukraine has also been able to shoot down the Kinzhal missiles Russia boasted were unstoppable with Patriots, and Russia's S-400 air defense system, while still formidable, has somewhat underperformed.\n\nRussia's military in general has underperformed compared to Western expectations, including in its failure to quickly overpower Ukraine, which has left it bogged down in a grinding fight in the east. NATO officials also say the quality of its military has degraded throughout the war, though others have noted its learning too, making it a threat the West is watching closely.",

    "description": "Drones have turned the front line into a kill zone, and made casualty evacuation extremely difficult and dangerous.",
    "fullText": "NATO forces would likely see heavier losses than Ukraine has in a war with Russia, a senior officer told Business Insider, and that possibility is driving a rethink of battlefield medical care.\n\nDrones are watching much of the front line, making it nearly impossible to get wounded troops access to medical care within the \"golden hour,\" the critical first 60 minutes after a severe injury when access to medical care may determine life or death.\n\nGolden hour is found only in books, said Ukrainian Col. Valerii Vyshnivskyi, the country's senior representative to the NATO-Ukraine Joint Analysis Training and Education Centre (JATEC).\n\nNow, there's only a golden day or month, he continued. \"The battlefield is visible 100%. That's why medical evacuation cannot be done in the old way.\"\n\nThe sky above the battlefield is filled with drones of all types executing both reconnaissance and strike missions. That saturation means Ukrainians often have to wait for unfavorable weather conditions and poor visibility to evacuate casualties. Some solutions, such as ground robots, are becoming more popular, but those systems aren't without their problems. They are vulnerable to attack, they break down, and they are susceptible to jamming.\n\nIn a high-intensity conflict against Russia, NATO forces would probably face the same casualty evacuation issues that Ukraine is dealing with, Vyshnivskyi said. However, he believes the military alliance would suffer heavier combat losses, as such a war has the potential to be significantly more destructive.\n\nNow nearly four years into the war, neither Ukraine nor Russia has publicly disclosed how many of their soldiers have been killed or wounded in combat. However, the total losses across both sides are unquestionably high.\n\nUkraine has suffered an estimated 400,000 casualties, including up to 100,000 troops killed, according to figures reported over the summer. Russia's toll is even grimmer: the UK defense ministry said last month that Moscow has likely taken more than 1.1 million casualties since its 2022 invasion and is now losing over 1,000 troops a day.\n\nWestern leaders have warned that the carnage, while presently unfolding on the battlefield and in Ukrainian cities, could expand deeper into Europe.\n\n\"Russia could be ready to use military force against NATO within five years,\" NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a speech last month, later adding that such a conflict would result in \"extreme losses.\"\n\nNATO is becoming increasingly aware of the threat that drones pose to the treatment and evacuation of wounded troops in armed conflict, and it is preparing to meet that challenge. The alliance is working to source solutions from the medical and defense industries to save lives on a drone-infested battlefield.\n\nCompanies from 20 nations submitted 175 applications to showcase solutions at an \"Innovation Challenge\" hosted by NATO Allied Command Transformation (ACT) and JATEC — a key initiative that uses real-time lessons from the war to inform Western defense planning — in London last month.\n\nTen finalists presented ideas, which included a portable system to treat kidney failure, a jury-rigged stretcher design for evacuation over rough terrain, a secure communications portal for medics, ballistic plates for makeshift shelter, and other innovative solutions.\n\nBritish Army Col. Niall Aye Maung, the medical branch head for NATO's ACT and the medical advisor to the alliance headquarters in Brussels, referred to the ideas as a \"system of systems,\" where there's no single solution for battlefield casualty treatment and medical care. Instead, they'd function together.\n\nACT officials are now examining how to overhaul the NATO medical system to meet the demands of a large-scale war, Maung told Business Insider — and they're turning to Ukraine's experience to find medical solutions, including through events like the innovation challenge.\n\nVyshnivskyi, the Ukrainian officer, said Western leaders and industry are starting to understand the challenges that Ukraine is dealing with on the battlefield.\n\nHowever, one of NATO's biggest problems, he said, is that building new capabilities takes far too long — much slower than the battlefield is changing.\n\nFor medical gear, the research and development process can be lengthy because items must undergo regulatory and legal processes to ensure their safety. Still, Maung said that most solutions NATO is looking for are commercial off-the-shelf products with dual-use applications in both civilian and military settings. This can speed up procurement timelines.\n\nQuicker procurement is something NATO is exploring well beyond medical capabilities, as allies look to keep pace with the evolution of war technology on the battlefield. Drones and other emerging technologies are at the center of these efforts.\n\n\"If we want to react and innovate at speed, we have to accept and respect that the speed of innovation in commercial markets and civilian markets is a lot faster than in traditional military markets, especially if you're looking at non-traditional armaments,\" Bart Hollants, NATO's innovation broker, told Business Insider.\n\nAs the Ukraine war continues, European militaries continue to buy up weapons and strengthen their defenses — especially nations along NATO's Eastern flank that border Russia — and prepare for the possibility of a larger war.\n\nRutte, NATO's secretary general, said during his speech last month that Europe needs \"to be ready\" because modern wars are \"no longer fought at arm's length.\"\n\n\"Conflict is at our door,\" he warned. \"Russia has brought war back to Europe, and we must be prepared for the scale of war our grandparents or great-grandparents endured.\"",

Kyiv denied attacking civilian targets.\n\nSvetlana Petrenko, spokeswoman of Russia's main criminal investigation agency, the Investigative Committee, said in a statement that a Ukrainian drone strike on a café and hotel in the village of Khorly, where at least 100 civilians were celebrating New Year's Eve overnight into Thursday, killed 27 people, including two minors. A total of 31, including five minors, were hospitalized with injuries.\n\nA criminal probe on the charges of carrying out an act of terrorism has been opened, Petrenko said.\n\nKyiv denied attacking civilians. Spokesman of Ukraine’s General Staff, Dmytro Lykhovii, told Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne on Thursday that Ukrainian forces “adhere to the norms of international humanitarian law” and \"carry out strikes exclusively against Russian military targets, facilities of the Russian fuel and energy sector, and other lawful targets.”\n\nLykhovii said that General Staff has published an explicit list of targets that the Ukrainian army struck on the night of New Year’s Eve. The list did not include strikes on occupied parts of the Kherson region.\n\nLykhovii noted that Russia has repeatedly used disinformation and false statements to disrupt the ongoing peace negotiations.\n\nThe Associated Press could not independently verify claims made about the attack.\n\nRussia's accusations against Ukraine come amid a U.S.-led diplomatic push to end the nearly four-year war in Ukraine. Earlier this week, Moscow alleged that Kyiv launched a long-range drone attack against a residence of Russian President Vladimir Putin in northwestern Russia overnight from Sunday to Monday.\n\nKyiv has called the allegations of an attack on Putin’s residence a ruse to derail ongoing peace negotiations, which have ramped up in recent weeks on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nIn his New Year’s address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that a peace deal was “90% ready” but warned that the remaining 10%, believed to include key sticking points such as territory, would “determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe, how people will live.”\n\nTrump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff said Wednesday that he, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner had a “productive call” with the national security advisers of Britain, France, Germany and Ukraine “to discuss advancing the next steps in the European peace process.”\n\nElsewhere in Ukraine, Russia conducted what local authorities called “one of the most massive” drone attacks at Zaporizhzhia overnight.\n\nAt least nine Russian drones struck the city, damaging dozens of residential buildings and other civilian infrastructure, head of the regional administration, Ivan Fedorov, wrote on Telegram on Friday. There were no casualties, the official said.\n\nOverall, Russia fired 116 long-range drones at Ukraine last night, according to Ukraine’s Air Force, which said that 86 drones were intercepted, while 27 more have reached their targets.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry reported Friday that its air defenses intercepted 64 Ukrainian drones overnight over multiple Russian regions.\n\nVyacheslav Gladkov, governor of Russia's Belgorod region on the border with Ukraine, on Friday also accused Ukrainian forces of carrying out a missile strike on the city of Belgorod. Two women were hospitalized with injuries, Gladkov said. The strike shattered windows in multiple residential buildings and damaged an unspecified “commercial” facility and a number of cars, according to the official.",

    "description": "Kyiv deception operation pays off as Moscow intelligence fooled by assassination claims",
    "fullText": "As far as the Russians were concerned, they had got their man.\n\nDenis Kapustin, one of the most prominent anti-Putin Russians fighting on behalf of Ukraine, was reported dead on Dec 27, assassinated by a drone on the southern front.\n\nHe had long been hunted by Moscow and the price on his head reflected this: Russian intelligence services had offered $500,000 (£370,000) to anyone who killed him.\n\nRussia paid this out after news broke of the successful hit this week. But what Vladimir Putin’s intelligence services did not know was that they had handed the money directly to Ukraine.\n\nMr Kapustin, known by his nom de guerre “White Rex”, founded the pro-Ukrainian Russian Volunteer Corps (RDK) in 2022.\n\nThe group made headlines in 2023 and 2024 when it carried out cross-border incursions into Russia’s Belgorod and Kursk regions, humiliating the Russian president and his generals.\n\nHis death was first confirmed by the RDK itself. “We will definitely take revenge, Denis,” the group said on Telegram. “Your legacy lives on.”\n\nYet on New Year’s Day, in a morale-raising ruse, Mr Kapustin re-emerged – alive and unscathed – in a video posted by Ukraine’s military intelligence (HUR).\n\n“Welcome back to life,” Gen Kyrylo Budanov, head of HUR, said with a wry smile. He congratulated Mr Kapustin and his team on a successful operation to deceive their Russian adversaries.\n\nIt turns out HUR, along with the RDK, had hatched a plan to fake Mr Kapustin’s death and claim the $500,000 bounty from Russia for themselves, to be used in Ukraine’s war effort.\n\n“First of all, Mr Denis, congratulations on your return to life. That is always a pleasure. I am glad that the money allocated for your assassination was used to support our struggle,” Gen Budanov added.\n\nRussia’s FSB and GRU agencies have long been feared for their ruthlessness.\n\nBut Ukrainian intelligence, throughout the near four-year war, has consistently proved its ability to outsmart their Russian counterparts, carrying out assassinations of generals and Kremlin officials on Russian soil, orchestrating complex sabotage operations and recruiting Russian agents.\n\nIn November, it was reported that Ukraine’s intelligence services used Russia’s own agents to accept missions offered openly by the FSB for financial reward and sabotaging its objectives.\n\nIn one case, a Ukrainian double-agent accepted a task from a Russia jobs board to build a bomb, which was then handed to a Russian saboteur.\n\nThe bomb, however, was made using flour and the Russian agent was captured by Ukraine after it failed to detonate.\n\nUkraine has also claimed responsibility for assassinations of high-ranking Russian officials, while Kyiv is suspected to have been behind many others.\n\nIn April, Yaroslav Moskalik, deputy chief of the main operations directorate of Russia’s army, was killed by a car bomb on Nesterov Boulevard in the Balashikha suburb of Moscow.\n\nBaza, a Russian media outlet with sources inside law enforcement agencies, said the home-made bomb was strapped to a parked Volkswagen car and detonated remotely when Moskalik, who lived in the neighbourhood, walked past.\n\nA month later, a former Ukrainian politician was shot dead in what appeared to be a professional hit job at the entrance of an exclusive school in Madrid.\n\nAndriy Portnov, a pro-Russian politician who worked as a close aide to the Moscow regime, was dropping off his daughters when an assassin shot him several times.\n\nThe shooting took place at the American School of Madrid while other parents were also making the school run.\n\nMost recently, Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov, 56, head ‍of the Russian army’s operational training ‍directorate, died in an explosion on Dec 22 in Moscow, probably planted by Ukrainian special forces.\n\nThe force of the explosion was such that at least seven cars parked nearby also sustained damage\n\nThe general worked in the Russian ministry of defence and participated in combat operations in Chechnya, Syria and Ossetia as well as Ukraine.\n\nAmong the most striking assassinations was the killing of Lt Gen Igor Kirillov on Dec 17 2024.\n\nThe officer, who was in charge of Russia’s nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, was killed by a remotely detonated device hidden inside an electric scooter.\n\n“Kirillov was a war criminal and an absolutely legitimate target, as he gave orders to use banned chemical weapons against the Ukrainian military,” a Ukrainian security source said.\n\nIn a daring mission in June 2025 – dubbed Operation Spiderweb – Ukraine-operated drones destroyed several Russian surveillance aircraft and nuclear-capable bombers, with officials in Kyiv saying this rendered a third of Russia’s strategic cruise missile carriers useless.\n\nThe drones had been smuggled into Russia and assembled, and launched from trucks deep within Russian territory, in another huge victory for Ukraine’s spies.\n\nUkraine’s latest intelligence success means Denis Kapustin, a far-Right extremist and former football hooligan, is inside Ukrainian territory and “preparing to continue carrying out assigned tasks”, said a Ukrainian commander.\n\nThe commander’s family moved from Moscow to Germany when Mr Kapustin was 17 and he relocated to Ukraine in 2017.\n\nSince 2019, he has been banned from entering the Schengen Area for promoting neo-Nazi ideology.\n\nIn the early weeks of Russia’s full-scale invasion, Mr Kapustin helped set up units that would become Ukraine’s 3rd Assault Brigade that played a key role in defending Kyiv and later become renowned for its fierce fighting on the eastern front.\n\nResponding to reports of his death, the 3rd Army Corps said: “We together confronted the common enemy in the battle for Kyiv.”\n\nIt added on Dec 27: “He perceived [Ukraine] as a place of real resistance and freedom.”\n\nIn August 2022, Mr Kapustin set up the RDK, with the goal of overthrowing Putin to bring “peace to Russia”. Its stated aim is to end Putin’s regime of “lies, corruption, and lawlessness”.\n\nIt is made up of former Wagner Group recruits, some former FSB agents and civilian volunteers. It is deemed a terrorist organisation by Russia.\n\nRussian courts have twice sentenced Mr Kapustin to life imprisonment in absentia on treason and terrorism charges.\n\nIn March 2024, the RDK stormed into Russia alongside other anti-Kremlin militias on tanks and armoured vehicles. It clashed with Russian security services and captured Russian soldiers.\n\nKyiv has said that while it fights as part of Ukraine’s military, under its command, the incursions into Russia were not taking place under Kyiv’s orders.\n\nSince its incursions, the group is either fighting at the front or engaged in cross-border sabotage operations in Russia.\n\nIn an interview with The Telegraph in September, an RDK commander known as “White”, a 26-year-old Russian volunteer, described how he joined in order to exact revenge on Putin for invading Ukraine.\n\n“We fight to change something in Russia,” he said. “When the war ends, I will continue fighting until Putin falls.”",

    "description": "Russia is using helicopters to try to stop Ukraine's drones. Now its naval drones armed with missiles keep Russia's helicopters away, per a commander.",
    "fullText": "Russian helicopters are now steering clear of Ukraine's naval drones because they are vulnerable to the surface-to-air missiles some carry, a Ukrainian special forces commander said.\n\nThe commander, call sign Thirteen, leads \"Group 13,\" a special forces unit within Ukraine's defense intelligence agency, the GUR, that uses naval drones. He said that Russian helicopters initially \"posed a critical threat and made our work difficult.\"\n\nHowever, the naval drones evolved to counter the aircraft. Specifically, Ukraine armed them with missiles.\n\n\"After that, the enemy stopped using helicopters against us altogether, realising they had become easy targets for our missiles,\" Thirteen said. He spoke earlier this month at a GUR showcase about Ukraine's naval drones, and his comments were reported by Ukrainian outlet Pravda.\n\nThe commander did not specify when this change occurred, but his update indicates an increasingly successful role for Ukraine's pioneering naval drones. The drones achieved tremendous wins against Russian warships, forcing Russia to relocate its naval vessels and increase combat air patrols. Now, it appears the new missile-armed naval drones are seeing success in driving away the air patrols.\n\nUkraine claimed its first naval drone kill of a Russian helicopter last December, calling it a first worldwide. It said a Magura V5 sea drone destroyed a Russian Mi-8 helicopter with missiles. Ukraine has since claimed more helicopter hits with its naval drones.\n\nThe usefulness of helicopters has shifted throughout the war. Russia saw its Ka-52 attack helicopters defeat Ukrainian armor but also suffered losses to air defenses, the proliferation of which has made it extremely difficult for either side to take control of the skies.\n\nRussian helicopters, much like Ukraine's, have broadly been vulnerable to interceptors and drones, both aerial first-person-view (FPV) drones and now naval drones. They're increasingly employed with caution but still used for troop transport, logistical support, evacuations, armed support, air assault missions, and drone hunts.\n\nUkraine, for instance, has new helicopter units dedicated to shooting down Russian drones. Notably, though, they're engaging Shahed-style long-range one-way attack drones that Russia uses to attack cities, not front-line attack drones.\n\nThe naval drones' ability to shoot down helicopters reflects how rapidly the systems have evolved to hit a wider range of targets. Early in the war, the drones were used mainly as explosive-laden attack craft, ramming Russian warships and other vessels.\n\nAlong with aerial drones, they helped Ukraine blunt Russia's naval power despite Ukraine lacking a traditional navy, including by forcing much of Russia's Black Sea Fleet to withdraw to ports farther from Ukraine. The fleet used to be based in Sevastopol but is now positioned primarily at Novorossiysk.\n\nOver time, Ukraine has expanded the drones' capabilities by adding missile and rocket launchers, guns, and even other drones that can be launched from the vessels. New variants and missions have followed, including drones that have downed Russian fighter jets and others designed specifically to strike Russian assets on rivers.\n\nUkraine makes its own sea drones, including Magura variants and the Sea Baby. Russia has also gotten into the naval drone business, and the West is increasingly paying attention to the impact that the assets can have in war.",

Meanwhile, Brent crude futures are around $61 a barrel.\n\nOil prices have been on a downtrend due to rising output from producers and slowing demand growth.\n\nThe supply-demand dynamic has weighed heavily on prices, dulling the impact of geopolitical tensions that might otherwise have lifted crude, including US strikes on Iran in June and the US's blockade of sanctioned oil tankers going to and from Venezuela.\n\n\"What's really stood out in oil markets this year is the lack of volatility, particularly given the myriad geopolitical events and supply risks,\" wrote Warren Patterson, the head of commodities strategy at ING, earlier this month.\n\nPatterson attributed that to fatigue over geopolitical developments and growing expectations of a supply surplus toward the latter part of the year.\n\nFor Russia, persistently low prices have magnified the impact of sweeping Western sanctions over its February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDiscounts on Russian oil sold at export terminals have climbed back toward historic highs, squeezing exporters' profits just as energy revenues become more critical for Russian President Vladimir Putin's administration.\n\nRussian crude sold at discounts of $20 to $30 a barrel below the Brent oil price in December, making its widest gap at ports since early 2022, according to data from Reuters.\n\nAn analysis from Goldman Sachs earlier this month showed Russia's oil export revenues, measured in rubles, have plunged 50% this year, tumbling from the equivalent of 7.6% of GDP to just 3.7%.\n\nThe pressure comes as Russia's economic momentum slows.\n\nRussia's GDP grew 0.6% in the third quarter from a year ago, slower than the growth rates of 1.1% in the second quarter and 1.4% in the first quarter.\n\nEconomic growth is set to cool even more sharply. The central bank now sees economic expansion of just 0.5% to 1.5% in 2026 and cut its 2025 growth forecast to 0.5% to 1%, down from earlier expectations.\n\nThat follows economic growth of 4.3% in 2024, when defense spending, state subsidies, and higher energy revenues bolstered Russia's economy.",

Usmanov's defense team had challenged the allegations about his ties to the companies and valuables and the applicability of EU law in the case.\n\nThe prosecutors said the discontinuation of the investigation upon payment of a fine was authorized under German criminal law.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The United States is offering Ukraine security guarantees for a period of 15 years as part of a proposed peace plan, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday, though he said he would prefer an American commitment of up to 50 years to deter Russia from further attempts to seize its neighbor’s land by force.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump hosted Zelenskyy at his Florida resort on Sunday and insisted that Ukraine and Russia are “closer than ever before” to a peace settlement.\n\nNegotiators are still searching for a breakthrough on key issues, however, including whose forces withdraw from where and the fate of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, one of the 10 biggest in the world. Trump noted that the monthslong U.S.-led negotiations could still collapse.\n\n“Without security guarantees, realistically, this war will not end,” Zelenskyy told reporters in voice messages responding to questions sent via a Whatsapp chat.\n\nUkraine has been fighting Russia since 2014, when it illegally annexed Crimea and Moscow-backed separatists took up arms in the Donbas, a vital industrial region in eastern Ukraine.\n\nDetails of the security guarantees have not become public but Zelenskyy said Monday that they include how a peace deal would be monitored as well as the “presence” of partners. He didn’t elaborate, but Russia has said it won’t accept the deployment in Ukraine of troops from NATO countries.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump were expected to speak in the near future but there was no indication the Russian leader would speak to Zelenskyy.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Kyiv’s allies will meet in Paris in early January to “finalize each country’s concrete contributions” to the security guarantees.\n\nTrump said he would consider extending U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine beyond 15 years, according to Zelenskyy. The guarantees would be approved by the U.S. Congress as well as by parliaments in other countries involved in overseeing any settlement, he said.\n\nZelenskyy said he wants the 20-point peace plan under discussion to be approved by Ukrainians in a national referendum.\n\nHowever, holding a ballot requires a ceasefire of at least 60 days, and Moscow has shown no willingness for a truce without a full settlement.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump slathered a fresh coat of makeup on his hand for another round of peace talks with Ukraine on Sunday.\n\nTrump, 79, welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to his Mar-a-Lago estate as he continues to chase down an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, which he promised to end on his first day back in office.\n\nThe mismatched concealer on Trump’s hand was once again evident as he took questions from reporters.\n\nJust days ago, on Christmas Eve, the now-familiar bruising on Trump’s right hand was coupled with some discoloration on his left. On Sunday, however, his left hand seemed back to normal, while his right hand remained covered in makeup.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reverted to a statement she has been reusing since February when reached for comment by the Daily Beast.\n\n“President Trump is a man of the people and he meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other President in history. His commitment is unwavering and he proves that every single day,” she said.\n\nLeavitt previously attributed the persistent bruising to “minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has closely catalogued the bruising on Trump’s hand, which he has been nursing for months. The makeup smears, together with Trump’s swollen ankles, mysterious MRI, mental flubs, and twice-in-a-year “annual” medical checkups, have raised concerns about the health of the oldest person to be inaugurated president.\n\nThe White House has consistently maintained that Trump is in “excellent health.”\n\nThe president was joined by several of his officials in Mar-a-Lago as he sat down for another meeting with Zelensky, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, special envoy Steve Witkoff, and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nA day before the meeting, Russia struck Kyiv with ballistic missiles and drones, killing at least one person and injuring 27 others.\n\nDespite the attack, Trump said he still believed Russian President Vladimir Putin was “very serious” about finding common ground with Ukraine.\n\n“I do believe that we have the makings of a deal that’s good for Ukraine, that’s good for everybody. There’s nothing more important,” he told reporters. “I’ve settled eight wars and this is the most difficult one. I thought it would be in the middle of the pack. This is the most difficult one, but we’re gonna get it done.”\n\nThe president stopped short of laying out a timeline for the end of peace talks.\n\n“I don’t have deadlines,” he said. “You know what my deadline is? Getting the war ended.”",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Several key issues remain unresolved in ongoing negotiations between Ukraine and the United States over a potential framework to end Russia’s war, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last week. Speaking about a 20-point plan under discussion, Zelenskyy outlined the most difficult points, noting that Ukraine has already conveyed its position to Washington, which is expected to communicate it to Moscow.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday that the Kremlin had already been in contact with U.S. representatives since Russian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev recently met with U.S. envoys in Florida. However, he did not reveal any details, saying only: “It was agreed upon to continue the dialogue.”\n\nZelenskyy said talks continue over the nature and scope of security guarantees that would be provided to Ukraine under any agreement. He said several technical issues remain, including how guarantees would be enforced and what monitoring mechanisms would be used to ensure compliance.\n\nZelenskyy said the fate of the territories that Russia claims remain the most difficult issue in the talks. He did not provide details, but has repeatedly said Kyiv will not recognize Russian control over occupied regions, including areas seized since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. Zelenskyy has also repeatedly stated Ukraine will not cede territories it currently controls, which Russia has publicly demanded.\n\nZaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant\n\nZelenskyy said the future of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains unresolved. The facility, Europe’s largest, has been under Russian control since early on in the war and has raised repeated international safety concerns due to fighting nearby.\n\nUkraine has been consistent in saying that safe operation of the station requires demilitarization of its territory, where Russia currently has troops stationed. Apart from that, Ukraine has been insisting that Ukrainian workers should be granted full access to the station, which they currently don’t have.\n\nDetails previously released in the course of the current negotiations revealed that the U.S. and Ukrainian teams are in discussion of a joint-access format, potentially between all three sides (the U.S., Ukraine, and Russia).\n\nZelenskyy said further discussions between Ukrainian and U.S. teams are expected, including talks in Florida, and that separate documents on economic recovery and prosperity are also under consideration.",

    "fullText": "Republican senators have joined Democrats to issue a pointed message to Donald Trump as he prepares to meet with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nZelensky, 47, will travel to Mar-a-Lago on Sunday to discuss a possible peace agreement to end Russia’s war in Ukraine with Trump, 79, who previously tried to bully Ukraine into accepting a U.S.-brokered deal favorable to Vladimir Putin.\n\nAfter Putin, 73, hit Ukraine with hundreds of drones and missiles over Christmas, GOP senators Thom Tillis, Jerry Moran, and John Barrasso, along with Democratic colleagues, offered a reminder that Putin, 73, is a “ruthless murderer.”\n\n“Today’s decision by Putin to launch attacks rather than hold fire is a sobering reminder for us all: Putin is a ruthless murderer who has no interest in peace and cannot be trusted,” reads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee release.\n\nThe senators added, “It bears repeating that President Zelenskyy agreed to a Christmas truce, but Putin declined, yet he directs soldiers to continue to commit brutal crimes of aggression on one of Christianity’s holiest days.”\n\nTillis, 65, a senator from North Carolina, Moran, 71, a senator from Kansas, and Barrasso, 73, a senator from Wyoming, were joined by Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, Jacky Rosen, Chris Coons, Jeff Merkley, and Chris Van Hollen, as well as Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats.\n\nThe message was not joined by more MAGA-friendly members of the committee, including its Republican chairman Jim Risch and Texas’ Ted Cruz.\n\nOnce firmly in control of congressional Republicans, Trump’s influence has weakened in recent months as his approval rating has plummeted and the GOP has lost in contests across the country.\n\nThe defeats suggest a path for Democrats to reclaim at least partial control of Congress in the 2026 midterms by flipping the House and even the Senate, leaving Trump to serve the remainder of his second term as a lame-duck president.\n\nMoreover, the trio of Republican senators is largely free from electoral pressure: Tillis is retiring in 2027, Moran faces reelection in 2028, and Barrasso in 2030.\n\nCritics have long accused Trump of playing into Putin’s hands while being hostile towards Ukraine and other traditional allies.\n\nIn recent months, he launched a diplomatic push to end the war, which began with Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022, but his proposed peace plan initially reflected many of Putin’s demands, blindsiding Zelensky and European allies.\n\nThe demands included limitations on Ukraine’s military and, crucially, the surrender of territory to Russia.\n\nLast month, Trump melted down at Ukraine on Truth Social, claiming that Zelensky had shown “ZERO GRATITUDE” in a message echoing his tantrum at their contentious Oval Office meeting in February. Zelensky responded by thanking Trump again.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader announced Thursday that he’d had a “good conversation” with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nHe told reporters Friday that he plans to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine with Trump on Sunday, as well as the “sensitive issue” of possible territorial concessions.\n\nWhile Zelesnky said the 20-point plan under discussion “is about 90% ready,” he cautioned, “Russia constantly looks for reasons not to agree.”",

    "title": "Drones keep shutting down European airports. This hybrid warfare could be a sign of worse to come, one analyst says.",
    "description": "Over 10,000 travelers have been disrupted by drone sightings near airports in recent months. Russia's hybrid warfare could be testing the limit.",
    "fullText": "It started in Copenhagen. Around 8:30 p.m. on a Monday in late September, a few large drones were spotted flying near the airport.\n\nAll takeoffs and landings were halted for almost four hours. More than 50 flights were diverted, and over 100 more were canceled.\n\nOn the same day, 30 flights were disrupted at Oslo Airport in Norway due to another suspected drone sighting.\n\nIn the past few months, several more European cities have seen nearby drones temporarily shut down their airports. It happened twice within 24 hours in Munich in early October. Over 10,000 people have had their travel plans disrupted.\n\nIn one sense, this is a nuisance for travelers. However, analysts and political leaders say it's an example of Russia's hybrid warfare.\n\nThis strategy involves using plausible deniability to undermine a society and can also include disinformation and cyberattacks.\n\nAs Blaise Metreweli, the chief of the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, said in her inaugural speech on December 15: \"The new frontline is everywhere.\"\n\nDrones have also been spotted near air bases, but the impact has been most palpable in Lithuania, the Baltic nation of less than 3 million people, whose eastern border is less than 70 miles as the crow flies from Russia's westernmost edge.\n\nOver the past 10 weeks, the airport in Vilnius, the capital, has been shut down 15 times. And not due to drones, but balloons smuggling crates of cheap cigarettes over the border from Belarus.\n\n\"They are also difficult to detect because they're not big aircraft or drones,\" said Sean Patrick, senior aviation security analyst at Osprey Flight Solutions.\n\n\"It is quite clever exploiting this from the Russian side to use these systems, and they've pushed Lithuania to declare this emergency.\"\n\nThirteen days before the Scandinavia incidents, around 20 Russian drones flew across the border into Poland. The airspace over four Polish airports was closed while NATO forces scrambled jets, shooting down up to four of the drones.\n\nPoland also invoked Article 4 of the NATO treaty, which calls for consultation over an urgent situation — its first usage since the start of the Ukraine War in 2022.\n\nThen, a Russia-linked ship was located off the Danish coast during the Copenhagen incident. The French military later boarded the oil tanker, and the captain, a Chinese national, was charged with one count of refusing to follow instructions from the French navy.\n\n\"A lot of these ships have changed their names quite recently,\" Patrick said. \"They've got new flags. It makes it very hard to follow who's doing what, who's working for who.\"\n\nHowever, at other points, links to Russia have been less clear. Police in Norway closed their investigation into the Oslo incident, saying there wasn't enough evidence that there were actually any drones.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has denied the country's involvement.\n\nIn an analyst report earlier this month, Osprey Flight Solutions said: \"It remains unconfirmed whether any/all of the … incidents are directly linked.\"\n\n\"Osprey assesses that some of the drone sightings are likely to be false identifications — i.e. not drones.\"\n\nIn July 2024, a package exploded in a DHL freight center in Leipzig, Germany. The head of the country's domestic intelligence service said it was \"only a lucky coincidence\" that the delayed package caught fire on the ground, rather than during flight.\n\nSimilar fires occurred at depots in Poland and the UK. Then, this September, Lithuanian prosecutors charged 15 people with terrorism offences, the BBC reported.\n\nThey said the individuals, with links to Russian intelligence, put explosive devices in vibrating massage pillows, which were set off with electronic timers. The parcels were all shipped from Lithuania.\n\nInvestigators have also said they believe these were dry runs aimed at sabotaging flights to the US and Canada.\n\n\"You can't see Europe going to war with Russia over some balloons in Lithuania,\" Patrick told Business Insider. \"And then it's where do you get to the limit? Does Europe want to find out what the limit is?\"\n\n\"So that's the concern,\" he added. \"If they do blow up a railway or set off an incendiary device on a transatlantic flight, what's the next step? Do people want to find out that next step?\"\n\nThe incidents highlight how Europeans face a new reality since the war in Ukraine began in 2022.\n\nEven Dublin Airport — over 1,500 miles from Kyiv — experienced a drone incident. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had arrived in the Irish capital ahead of schedule earlier this month, before the drones were spotted nearby.\n\nSome European leaders have called for building a drone wall — a system of air defenses in the east of the continent to stop drones launched from Russia.\n\nWhile discussions continue over a peace deal in Ukraine, tensions are likely to remain high.\n\n\"Even if the Ukraine war comes to some sort of hold, ceasefire, peace agreement, I think we can expect Russia to continue these,\" Patrick said. \"They've got a taste for it now.\"",

    "fullText": "An explosion in Moscow on Wednesday killed three people, including two police officers, Russian investigators said, days after a car bomb killed a high-ranking general not far away.\n\nAn official from Ukraine’s military intelligence, known as GUR, told The Associated Press that the attack had been carried out as part of an agency operation. Another official from the agency said the police officers had taken part in Russia’s war in Ukraine, without providing details. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\n\nRussian authorities did not comment on who may be behind the attack. Since Moscow invaded nearly four years ago, Russian authorities have blamed Kyiv for several assassinations of military officers and public figures in Russia. Ukraine has claimed responsibility for some of them.\n\nOn Wednesday, two traffic police officers were approaching a suspicious individual when a device detonated, Russia's Investigative Committee spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko said in a statement. The officers and another person standing nearby died from their injuries.\n\nThe Interior Ministry named the officers as Lt. Ilya Klimanov, 24, who joined the Moscow police in October 2023, and Lt. Maxim Gorbunov, 25. Gorbunov had a wife and a 9-month-old daughter, the statement said.\n\nThe blast took place in the same area of the Russian capital where Lt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov was killed by a car bomb on Monday. Sarvarov was the head of the Operational Training Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces’ General Staff.\n\nInvestigators have said they are looking into whether Ukraine was behind that attack, which was the third such killing of a senior military officer in just over a year. Ukraine has not commented on it.\n\nUkraine — which is outnumbered by Russia’s larger, better equipped military — has frequently tried to change the course of the war by attacking in unexpected ways.\n\nIn August last year, Ukrainian forces staged a surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region even as they struggled to stem Russian offensives elsewhere. Moscow’s troops eventually drove them out, but the incursion diverted Russian military resources and raised Ukrainian morale.\n\nIn June, swarms of drones launched from trucks targeted bomber bases across Russia.\n\nMoscow has also blamed assassinations on Ukraine. Just over a year ago, Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the chief of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed by a bomb hidden on an electric scooter outside his apartment building. Kirillov’s assistant also died. Ukraine’s security service claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nDays after Moskalik’s killing, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he received a report from the head of Ukraine’s foreign intelligence agency on the “liquidation” of top Russian military figures, adding that “justice inevitably comes” although he didn’t mention Moskalik’s name.\n\nMeanwhile, Western officials have accused Russia of staging a campaign of disruption and sabotage across Europe as part of an effort to sap support for Ukraine. Moscow has denied the claims.",

    "fullText": "Like many of his US counterparts, the Russian science prodigy turned hugely successful ‘digital populist’ has a deep suspicion of government constraint\n\nTech visionary, Kremlin dissident, FSB agent, free speech absolutist, health guru. These are just some of the labels admirers and critics have attached to Pavel Durov over the past decade.\n\nThe Russian-born tech entrepreneur founded Russia’s version of Facebook before going on to create the messaging app Telegram, launch a cryptocurrency ecosystem and amass a multibillion-dollar fortune, all while clashing repeatedly with authorities in Russia and beyond.\n\nBut much of Durov’s real story – and the logic that drives him – remains obscured.\n\nA new biography aims to change that.\n\nThe Populist, by the independent Russian writer Nikolay Kononov, traces the 41-year-old’s rise from a St Petersburg schoolboy science prodigy to the founder of Telegram, one of the world’s most influential communications platforms, which has more than a billion users.\n\nKononov describes the book as the product of a 14-year attempt to map Durov’s strategy and mindset, drawing on conversations with Durov himself and people who worked with him, as well as rivals and critics.\n\nThe book’s title, he said, refers to a thread running through Durov’s life: his desire to address Telegram’s millions of users directly, allowing him to bypass institutions, the press and any system of representation.\n\n“Durov is one of the first digital populists,” Kononov said in an interview, explaining that “from the very beginning, as soon as he started making his digital products, he programmed into them the ability to write and communicate his ideas directly to his audience.”.\n\nBoth VKontakte, Durov’s first venture, and Telegram have at times pushed messages from Durov directly to all users, including users who had not opted in, outlining his libertarian worldview.\n\n“He sees himself as a visionary. And obviously wants to be heard,” the author said.\n\nThat strategy has helped promote Durov’s central promise – almost absolute freedom of expression – even as Telegram has become a go-to tool for dissidents, extremists, scammers and war propagandists.\n\nIf Durov’s public brand is built on libertarianism, Kononov says his private management style points in the opposite direction: power concentrated in one man’s hands, with few visible checks.\n\n“He is essentially the only one making all the product decisions at Telegram,” Kononov said. “Marketing, PR – it’s a one-man show.”\n\nThe portrait he draws is of a tech founder whose worldview has not wavered over the years, remaining most comfortable within an ultra-libertarian, anti-institutional strand of the right that is often misogynistic and, at times, conspiratorial.\n\n“What surprised me most is that Durov hasn’t changed or evolved in all the years that I have interviewed him,” Kononov said.\n\nDurov is not an outlier, Kononov writes, but part of a broader new wave of moguls – most visibly in the US – who pair technological dominance with an outsized sense of personal mythology and a deep suspicion of government constraint.\n\nLike Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Jeff Bezos, he has shown a strong interest in longevity science as well as pronatalism, the belief that having as many children as possible is a social or civilisational duty.\n\nDurov does not drink or use drugs, Kononov says, regularly dispenses spartan health advice – often alongside photos of him shirtless – and has said he has fathered dozens of children through sperm donation.\n\nOne of the book’s most striking sections tells for the first time of Durov’s tense early meeting with President Vladimir Putin in 2014, held behind closed doors.\n\nKononov writes that Durov described the encounter as a one-way conversation, in which the Kremlin leader reprimanded him over illegal content on Vkontakte and suggested that Durov leave the country.\n\nUnder pressure from the authorities, Durov sold his stake in Vkontakte, left Russia and eventually settled in Dubai, where he founded Telegram.\n\nBut the clearest mark on Durov in recent years, Kononov suggests, came not from Russia but from France.\n\nDurov, who also holds French citizenship, was detained and held for three days in France in August last year as part of an investigation into crimes linked to Telegram, including the circulation of child sexual abuse images, drug trafficking and fraudulent transactions.\n\nHis detention came as a shock to the tech mogul. In interviews conducted in Paris after his arrest, Durov described to Kononov a harsh, disorienting ordeal – a permanently lit cell and little sleep – that rattled a man who had spent years insulating himself from the reach of the state.\n\nIt also appears to have sharpened his hostility towards the west. Kononov says Durov now frames Europe as sliding toward “total digital control”, and increasingly conspiratorial rhetoric.\n\nMost recently, Durov appeared to endorse a conspiracy theory promoted by the far-right blogger Candace Owens, suggesting that Paris was behind the killing of Charlie Kirk.\n\n“What interests me about Durov is that, on the one hand, he clearly has a very high IQ,” Kononov said. “But at the same time, he is prone to conspiracy theories.”\n\nKononov is adamant, however, that Durov’s views should not be conflated with formal political allegiances.\n\nOne of the most persistent claims surrounding Durov is that he is secretly aligned with Russian security services.\n\nBut Kononov said that in the course of his research, he found no evidence that Durov has worked with, or on behalf of, the Russian state. “He has a huge number of flaws – but not the sin of Telegram acting as a backdoor for the FSB,” Kononov said.\n\nKononov argues that what Durov has ultimately learned is the need to compromise – with both Russian and western authorities – when it serves his interests and allows Telegram to continue operating.\n\nKononov recalls Durov once telling him: “I never waste time on things that are unnecessary or that cannot be useful to me personally.” That self-serving mindset, Kononov said, ultimately ended their personal relationship.\n\nAbout a year ago, the writer asked Durov whether he saw a contradiction between Telegram’s highly centralised, almost authoritarian internal structure and his professed devotion to freedom of expression. After that, Durov stopped responding.\n\n“He quickly realised it wasn’t going to be a book to his liking,” Kononov said.",

    "description": "When Vladimir Putin made a four-day trip to visit Xi Jinping in September, he addressed his Chinese counterpart as a “dear friend”.",
    "fullText": "When Vladimir Putin made a four-day trip to visit Xi Jinping in September, he addressed his Chinese counterpart as a “dear friend”.\n\nSpeaking to Xi across a vast display of orchids in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, the Russian president claimed their ties were “at an unprecedentedly high level”.\n\nCertainly on the surface it appears China’s alliance with Russia has only grown stronger since Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nNowhere has this been more evident than when looking at trade between the two countries, which has boomed ever since the West slapped Putin with massive sanctions.\n\nLast year, the value of trade between Russia and China hit a record $245bn (£182bn), fuelled by Xi becoming the world’s largest buyer of Putin’s oil and gas. Overall, China also became Russia’s biggest supplier of goods.\n\nHowever, closer ties with China have come at a cost.\n\nIn particular, Russian businesses have grown increasingly frustrated at a flood of cheap Chinese goods.\n\nVladimir Milov, who worked in the Russian government from 1997 to 2002 before becoming a vocal Putin critic, says the economic alliance is backfiring badly for Russia.\n\n“It is deeply disadvantageous,” he says. “China is taking advantage because it knows that Russia has nowhere to go.”\n\nSuch warnings could signal that the economic ties between the two countries are beginning to fray.\n\nWhile mutual trade hit a record high in 2024, it has fallen by nearly a tenth so far this year.\n\nOne key area of tension is cars.\n\nAfter Western manufacturers cut ties with Russia in 2022, Chinese competitors duly stepped in.\n\nIn the two years to 2024, Chinese car exports to Russia have increased sevenfold, prompting a growing number of complaints from domestic manufacturers.\n\nMaxim Sokolov, the chief executive of Russian carmaker AvtoVAZ, has accused the Chinese of “unprecedented dumping”, which he said in December has crossed “all imaginable boundaries”.\n\nSales of his company’s signature Lada car have plunged, pushing the company to slash production by nearly half and move to a four-day work week at the end of September.\n\nRussia’s largest truck manufacturer, Kamaz, also trimmed its working week in August after demand for its vehicles plunged by 60pc. At the time it blamed “excessive” imports.\n\nTo alleviate some of the criticism, the Kremlin has responded by significantly raising import fees on vehicles.\n\nSince October 2024, Russia has more than doubled the “recycling fee” that it charges on imported cars.\n\nThis charge, which is supposedly to cover the future disposal of the vehicle but functions largely as a tariff, was 667,000 roubles (£6,275) per vehicle as of January this year.\n\nThis led to Chinese car exports to Russia halving in the first six months of 2025.\n\nIn July, Russian regulators also banned truck imports from a fleet of major Chinese brands – Dongfeng, Foton, FAW and Sitrak – which they branded a “direct threat” to public safety.\n\n“These trade-related tensions will start to occur more and more as the market gets saturated with Chinese goods and uncompetitive Russian industries are not able to make their sales,” says John Kennedy, a research leader at Rand.\n\nThere are signs that Russia’s steel sector is also hurting.\n\nAndrey Gartung, chief executive of the Chelyabinsk Forging and Press Plant, warned last year: “Russian enterprises competing with Chinese ones are holding on by the skin of their teeth.”\n\nNot one to shy away, China has hit back with trade restrictions of its own.\n\nMost notably, Xi reintroduced tariffs on Russian coal in January 2024, two years after the restrictions were first lifted.\n\nThis has already hit exports to China, with Milov claiming that the levies are adding to what is the worst crisis for Russia’s coal industry since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe sector’s revenues are expected to plummet by 12pc this year alone.\n\nElsewhere, China has so far refused to lift a longstanding ban on imports of Russia’s largest agricultural exports – winter wheat and barley. Instead, it buys from Ukraine and Kazakhstan.\n\nWhat China does import from Russia, it gets incredibly cheaply because it has a monopoly as one of Russia’s only buyers, says Milov.\n\nRussia’s biggest exports to China are oil and gas, which combined make up two thirds of its trade.\n\nIgor Sechin, Rosneft’s chief executive, said that between January 2022 and June 2024, China’s savings from purchasing Russian oil compared to Middle Eastern exports amounted to as much as $18bn.\n\n“Taking the sanctions away, Russia is what Beijing would want every trading partner to look like,” says Gregor Sebastian, of Rhodium’s China Corporate Advisory team.\n\n“China is importing raw materials that it produces into manufactured goods that it can then resell at much higher profit margins back to Russia. That is the main bulk of the relationship.”\n\nHowever, more than anything, Russia wants new technology and investment from China. And it is not getting it.\n\nThe average annual flow of Chinese investment into Russia has plummeted from an average of $1.2bn from 2011 to $400m, says Milov.\n\nIn 2022, China dropped Russia from its Belt and Road financing programme, while in July, China’s commerce ministry “strongly advised” carmakers against investing in Russia.\n\nMany major projects that were previously announced with Chinese backing have now been scrapped or are on hold.\n\nRussia quietly disappeared from what was supposed to be a joint development of a long-haul aircraft with the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China.\n\nWork had already begun on the project, initially called the CR929, which stood for “China Russia”. However, the R has now been dropped, with the aircraft renamed as the C929.\n\nPlans for Chinese CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles to build a high-speed rail line between Moscow and Kazan in south-west Russia have also been paused.\n\nSeparately, there has been no progress on the development of the Tianjin oil refinery, a joint venture between Rosneft and the Chinese National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), which was approved in 2014.\n\nAfter the meeting between Putin and Xi in September, Gazprom announced that the two countries had signed a deal to build a “Power of Siberia 2” gas pipeline to China.\n\nBut while this would no doubt prove to be a huge victory for Russia, China has yet to confirm the project.\n\nThis may be a sign that, for all the pomp and ceremony, the countries’ authoritarian alliance may be weaker than it appears.\n\n“Despite all these hugs and kisses at summits, China and Russia are very much far apart,” says Milov.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

In other cases, they have denied all involvement.\n\nOn Monday, a Russian general was killed by a car bomb in Moscow, and investigators say they are looking into whether Ukraine was behind the attack. Ukraine has not yet commented on the death of Lt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov.\n\nOther attacks that Russia has blamed on Ukraine include:\n\nKirillov, head of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed alongside his assistant, Ilya Polikarpov, when a bomb planted on a scooter exploded outside an apartment building in Moscow in December 2024.\n\nKirillov had been charged in absentia a day earlier by Ukraine’s Security Service, the SBU, with ”ordering the use of banned chemical weapons against Ukraine’s Defense Forces.” The SBU later claimed responsibility for the attack. An Uzbek man was quickly arrested and charged with killing Kirillov on the security service’s behalf.\n\nMoskalik, a deputy head of the main operational department of the General Staff, was killed in April 2025. A bomb had been placed underneath his car, which was parked near his apartment building just outside Moscow.\n\nSeveral days after the attack, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a statement that the country’s Foreign Intelligence Service had informed him of the “elimination of senior command personnel of Russia’s armed forces,” but gave no further details.\n\nA Russian man who previously lived in Ukraine pleaded guilty to carrying out the attack and said that he had been paid by Ukraine's security services.\n\nRzhitsky, a former submarine commander, was gunned down in July 2023 while jogging in Krasnodar, Russia.\n\nUkrainian media reported that Rzhitsky was one of six submarine commanders able to launch the long-range missiles that hit Vinnytsia, Ukraine, a year earlier, killing 23 people and wounding over 100.\n\nWhen he died, Rzhitsky was deputy head of a military mobilization office in Krasnodar.\n\nKyrylo Budanov, head of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s main intelligence directorate, denied Kyiv’s involvement in the death. However, the agency also released details about the killing, including the time of the attack and the number of shots fired. A dual Russian-Ukrainian citizen was convicted in the killing in October 2024.\n\nPrilepin, a nationalist Russian writer, narrowly avoided death in a car bombing in Russia’s Nizhny Novgorod region in May 2023. His driver was killed, while Prilepin was hospitalized with broken bones, bruised lungs and other injuries.\n\nPrilepin, known for his support of the war, was sanctioned by the European Union.\n\nA Ukrainian was found guilty of the attack in a Russian court and sentenced to life imprisonment. Russia’s Investigative Committee accused him of working on orders from Kyiv.\n\nIn an interview with Ukrainian journalists in March 2024, SBU chief Lt. Gen. Vasyl Maliuk declined to take responsibility for the attack, but said he could provide some details, such as Prilepin's injuries.\n\nTatarsky, a military blogger, was killed in April 2023 when a bomb tore through a cafe in central St Petersburg where he had been speaking.\n\nTatarsky supported the war in Ukraine and filed regular reports from the front for his Telegram followers.\n\nDarya Trepova was convicted of the bombing and sentenced to 27 years in prison after she was seen on camera presenting a small statue to Tatarsky that exploded shortly afterward. Trepova testified she didn’t know the gift contained a bomb.\n\nIn the March 2024 interview, SBU chief Maliuk also declined to take responsibility for Tatarsky's death, but describing the blogger as a mouthpiece for Russia who had \"paid a karmic price before the Ukrainian people.” He also provided details on the bomb that killed Tatarsky.\n\nKyva, a Ukrainian lawmaker who fled to Russia shortly after the full-scale invasion, was found dead near Moscow in December 2023 with a gunshot wound to the head.\n\nA controversial political figure in Ukraine before the war, Kyva often appeared on pro-Kremlin TV talk shows. A month before his death, a Ukrainian court found him guilty in absentia of treason and sentenced him to 14 years in prison.\n\nRussia’s state Investigative Committee accused an Armenian-born businessman of passing on details about Kyva’s movements to the SBU, state news agency Tass said. However, no charges have been brought directly related to the killing.\n\nAndriy Yusov, a spokesman for Ukraine’s military intelligence, said after Kyva’s death that “the same fate will befall other traitors of Ukraine,” but did not say who was behind the killing.\n\nDugina was killed in August 2022 when a remote-controlled bomb planted in her SUV blew up as she drove on Moscow’s outskirts.\n\nHer father, Alexander Dugin, was widely believed to be the intended target. The philosopher, writer and political theorist is an ardent supporter of the war.\n\nUkraine denied responsibility for the attack, with Zelenskyy saying Dugina was “not our responsibility\" and Kyiv was \"not interested in her.”\n\nRussia’s Federal Security Agency, the FSB, publicly identified two Ukrainian citizens as suspects, but said they had escaped abroad.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "Russia has sent the cavalry to the front line in its latest low-tech attempt to claim land in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region.\n\nVideo footage shared by Ukraine’s 92nd Brigade shows drones hunting down Russian soldiers as they race through an open field on horseback.\n\nIn the clip, a Russian soldier is seen riding as a drone tracks his movement. Moments later, the drone strikes, hitting the soldier as he attempts to escape. The explosion spooks another horse, which unseats its rider before making a charge in another direction. A third rider is seen, but his fate is unknown.\n\n“Russian occupiers lose so much equipment during their ‘meat-grinder assaults’ that they’re forced to move on horseback,” the 92nd Brigade wrote in a post accompanying the footage.\n\nVladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine has been defined by rapid technological advances on the front lines, in particular in drone warfare. Small, off-the-shelf explosive drones have proved effective at defending against mechanised units and infantry.\n\nRussia recently introduced motorbikes and all-terrain vehicles as a way to speed across open countryside monitored by drones.\n\nHorses could offer yet more flexibility – agile on off-road terrain and less likely to trigger modern landmines equipped with magnetic sensors. The first horse-mounted casualty was reported by observers of the war in Ukraine in October.\n\nAt the same time, The Telegraph reported that the Storm unit of Russia’s 9th Brigade of the 51st Army had been preparing horse-mounted assault teams to operate in the Donetsk region.\n\nBefore this, there had been numerous reports of Russia utilising donkeys, horses and even camels to transport ammunition and other heavy equipment to the front line through muddy conditions not suitable for regular vehicles.\n\nThroughout the ages, horseback cavalry charges have provided speed, shock and flexibility on the battlefield.\n\nTanks and other heavily-armoured fighting machines are rarely seen on the battlefields of Ukraine and, when they do appear, they are almost instantly disabled by a wave of drones.\n\nRussia’s Kommersant newspaper said of the return of cavalry: “In armed conflicts that have become arenas for showcasing technological innovations, participants are once again forced to rely on basic tools – from analogue telephone lines to pack animals and carts – when modern technologies prove vulnerable.”\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Initial drafts of U.S. proposals for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia meet many of Kyiv's demands, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday, although he suggested that neither side in the almost four-year war is likely to get everything it wants in talks on reaching a settlement.\n\n“Overall, it looks quite solid at this stage,” the Ukrainian leader said of recent talks with U.S. officials who are trying to steer the neighboring countries toward compromises.\n\n“There are some things we are probably not ready for, and I’m sure there are things the Russians are not ready for either,” Zelenskyy told reporters in Kyiv.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has for months been pushing for a peace agreement, but the negotiations have run into sharply conflicting demands from Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nU.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday he held “productive and constructive” talks in Florida with Ukrainian and European representatives, though Trump was less effusive the following day, saying, “The talks are going along.”\n\n“We are talking. It's going OK,\" Trump said Monday while on vacation at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Asked if he planned to speak to Zelenskyy or Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump didn't say, offering only of the fighting, “I'd like to see it stopped.”\n\nZelenskyy, meanwhile, said “nearly 90%” of Ukraine’s demands have been incorporated into the draft agreements.\n\nThe backbone of the proposed deal is a 20-point plan, he said. There is also a framework document on security guarantees between Ukraine, European countries, and the United States, as well as a separate document on bilateral security guarantees granted to Ukraine by the U.S.\n\nZelenskyy mentioned several key points, such as the Ukrainian army remaining at a peacetime level of 800,000; membership in the European Union; and European forces, under the leadership of France and the U.K. and with a “backstop” from Washington, ensuring “Ukraine’s security in the air, on land, and at sea.”\n\n“Some key countries will provide presence in these domains; others will contribute to energy security, finance, bomb shelters, and so on,” the Ukrainian president said.\n\nUkraine is arguing that the bilateral document with the U.S. should be reviewed by the U.S. Congress, with some details and annexes kept classified, Zelenskyy said.\n\nThe U.S. team is now in talks with Russian envoys, and Washington has asked that no details be released, he added.\n\nUkraine strikes deep inside Russia\n\nZelenskyy said Monday he met with his military commanders who reported that defensive lines are holding firm against the Russian onslaught.\n\n“In (recent) weeks, the Russian army has significantly increased the intensity of attacks, and the number of Russian losses has increased accordingly,” he said in a post on Telegram.\n\nUkrainian forces hit an oil terminal, a pipeline, two parked jet fighters and two ships in a series of strikes on Russian soil, officials said Monday.\n\nThe attacks are part of an ongoing campaign to disrupt the Russian war effort and sow fear behind the front line, where outnumbered Ukrainian troops are straining to hold back Russia’s bigger army.\n\nThe strikes also seek to undermine Putin’s attempt to portray Russia as negotiating from a position of military strength in U.S.-led peace efforts, which have yet to make a breakthrough on key points.\n\nThe killing of a top Russian general by a car bomb in Moscow on Monday, with investigators suspecting Ukraine was behind it, could be another instance of Kyiv picking surprise targets.\n\nUkrainian partisans burn Russian fighter jets\n\nUkrainian forces struck the Tamanneftegaz oil terminal, an ammunition depot and a launch site for attack drones inside Russian territory and Russian-held Ukrainian territory, Ukraine’s General Staff said in a statement Monday.\n\nA pipeline, two docks and two ships were damaged in the southern Krasnodar region, and a large blaze broke out, the statement said, without specifying what kind of weapons were used in the attack.\n\nIt added that a Ukrainian-made missile also hit a temporary base for Russia's 92nd River Boat Brigade in Olenivka, in the occupied Crimean Peninsula.\n\nA separate strike targeted an ammunition depot in a Russian-controlled portion of the Donetsk region, aiming to slow the Russian advance there, the General Staff said. A Russian launch site for attack drones was also hit.\n\nUkrainian partisans set fire to two Russian jet fighters in an operation on Sunday evening at a base near Lipetsk, a city in western Russia, according to Ukraine’s military intelligence.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Defense said only that its forces shot down 41 Ukrainian drones overnight, three of them over the Krasnodar region.\n\nRussia targets the power grid again\n\nMeanwhile, Russian forces kept up their targeting of Ukraine’s energy sector, aiming to deprive civilians of heat and running water during the frigid winter. Russia has tried to knock out power in Ukraine throughout the war, in a tactic that Ukraine refers to as “weaponizing winter.”\n\nEnergy infrastructure across five regions were attacked during the night, Ukraine’s Ministry of Energy said.\n\nRussia struck Ukraine with 86 drones of different types overnight, Ukraine’s air force said. Ukrainian forces stopped 58 of them, it said.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

Investigators said Ukraine may be behind the attack.\n\nLt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov, head of the Operational Training Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces' General Staff, died from his injuries, said Svetlana Petrenko, the spokesperson for Russia’s Investigative Committee, the nation's top criminal investigation agency.\n\n“Investigators are pursuing numerous lines of inquiry regarding the murder. One of these is that the crime was orchestrated by Ukrainian intelligence services,” Petrenko said.\n\nSince Moscow sent troops into Ukraine nearly four years ago, Russian authorities have blamed Ukraine for several assassinations of military officers and public figures in Russia. Ukraine has claimed responsibility for some of them. It has not yet commented on Monday's death.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that President Vladimir Putin had been immediately informed about Sarvarov's killing.\n\nThe Defense Ministry said that Sarvarov had previously fought in Chechnya and taken part in Moscow's military campaign in Syria.\n\nJust over a year ago, Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the chief of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed by a bomb hidden on an electric scooter outside his apartment building. Kirillov's assistant also died. Ukraine’s security service claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nAn Uzbek man was quickly arrested and charged with killing Kirillov on behalf of the Ukrainian security service.\n\nPutin described Kirillov’s killing as a “major blunder” by Russia’s security agencies, noting they should learn from it and improve their efficiency.\n\nIn April, another senior Russian military officer, Lt. Gen. Yaroslav Moskalik, a deputy head of the main operational department in the General Staff, was killed by an explosive device placed in his car parked near his apartment building just outside Moscow. A suspected perpetrator was quickly arrested.\n\nDays after Moskalik's killing, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he received a report from the head of Ukraine’s foreign intelligence agency on the “liquidation” of top Russian military figures, adding that “justice inevitably comes\" although he didn't mention Moskalik's name.",

    "fullText": "A White House envoy said Sunday he held “productive and constructive” talks in Florida with Ukrainian and European representatives to end the nearly four-year war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nPosting on social media, Steve Witkoff said the talks aimed at aligning on a shared strategic approach between Ukraine, the United States and Europe.\n\n“Our shared priority is to stop the killing, ensure guaranteed security, and create conditions for Ukraine’s recovery, stability, and long-term prosperity. Peace must be not only a cessation of hostilities, but also a dignified foundation for a stable future,\" U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy said.\n\nThe talks are part of the Trump administration’s monthslong push for peace. Trump has unleashed an extensive diplomatic push to end the war, but his efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands by Moscow and Kyiv. Putin has recently signaled he is digging in on his maximalist demands on Ukraine, as Moscow’s troops inch forward on the battlefield despite huge losses.\n\nWitkoff's assessment comes as negotiations have been proceeding with Russia as well. A Kremlin envoy said Saturday that the talks were pressing on “constructively” in Florida.\n\n“The discussions are proceeding constructively. They began earlier and will continue today, and will also continue tomorrow,” Kirill Dmitriev told reporters in Miami on Saturday. There were no immediate updates on the talks with Russia on Sunday.\n\nDmitriev met with Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported.\n\nFor Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram Sunday that diplomatic efforts were “moving forward quite quickly, and our team in Florida has been working with the American side.”\n\nThe Kremlin denied Sunday that trilateral talks involving Ukraine, Russia and the U.S. were under discussion, after Zelenskyy said Saturday that Washington had proposed the idea of three-way discussions.\n\n“At present, no one has seriously discussed this initiative, and to my knowledge it is not being prepared,” Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said, according to Russian state news agencies.\n\nUkrainian civilians moved to Russia\n\nIn Ukraine, the country’s human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets on Sunday accused Russian forces of forcibly removing about 50 Ukrainian civilians from the Ukrainian Sumy border region to Russian territory.\n\nWriting on Telegram, he said that Russian forces illegally detained the residents in the village of Hrabovske on Thursday, before moving them to Russia on Saturday.\n\nLubinets said he contacted Russia’s human rights commissioner, requesting information on the civilians’ whereabouts and conditions, and demanding their immediate return to Ukraine.\n\nThe French presidency on Sunday welcomed Putin’s willingness to speak with President Emmanuel Macron, saying it would decide how to proceed “in the coming days.”\n\n“As soon as the prospect of a ceasefire and peace negotiations becomes clearer, it becomes useful again to speak with Putin,” Macron’s office said in a statement. “It is welcome that the Kremlin publicly agrees to this approach.”\n\nThe statement came after reports that Putin was open to holding talks with the French president if there was mutual political will.\n\nEuropean Union leaders agreed on Friday to provide 90 billion euros ($106 billion) to Ukraine to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years, although they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds. Instead, they were borrowed from capital markets.",

    "description": "The Ukrainian drone schools training operators for the fight with Russia take safety steps like giving staff polygraph tests and hiding.",
    "fullText": "The leaders of several drone schools training Ukraine's operators for the fight against Russia say they're targets and they have to act accordingly — tightly protecting information and even moving around.\n\nThroughout its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has launched huge drone and missile barrages at factories, training sites, and civilian infrastructure across the country, often far from the fighting in the east, straining Ukrainian defenses and serving as a constant reminder that nowhere in the country is completely safe.\n\nDrones are prolific on the battlefield in Ukraine. Operators are priority targets. It stands to reason the schools training them for war would be too. Officials from three drone schools told Business Insider that they take steps to avoid getting hit.\n\nTetyana, a Ukrainian veteran who goes by the call sign \"Ruda\" and is now the head of R&D for Dronarium, a drone training school with sites in Kyiv and Lviv, said that it must follow strict safety rules because \"the entirety of Ukraine is not safe, missile-wise, drone-wise.\"\n\nDmytro Slediuk, head of the education department at Dronarium, told BI the safety measures, including not disclosing publicly exactly where its training centers are located and also changing their location \"from time to time,\" are necessary to prevent Russia from interfering with its training\n\nTo keep certain location data from getting out, the school doesn't allow photos and videos that might reveal where its facilities are based.\n\nThe school has been mentioned by Russia's military bloggers, influential pro-war accounts that often circulate operational details and commentary to large audiences. Though they are typically in favor of the war, they are also sometimes critical of Russia's performance and dispute some of its defense ministry's claims.\n\nRybar, a media outlet with 1.5 million Telegram subscribers, listed Dronarium as an example of Ukraine's drone training efforts. The UK has sanctioned Rybar, initially presented as a milblogger but actually a partially Russian government-sponsored information warfare operation, and the US has offered up to $10 million for information.\n\nTetyana said Russian outlets have been writing about the school since 2022, the year Russia started its full-scale invasion. \"As long as they write and talk about us, it means that they are afraid of us,\" she said. But it also means that they're on Russia's radar.\n\nShe said the school and its attendees strictly adhere to a set of critical cybersecurity rules, and said there are also general safety rules in place. \"When the air raid siren is on, all training activities, all the work, everything gets suspended, and we deconcentrate and get into safe shelters.\" She said no one is complacent.\n\nVitalii Pervak, CEO of another training school, Karlsson, Karas & Associates, said that safety steps are crucial because \"the Russians are constantly hunting for places where military personnel gather.\"\n\nUkrainian officials have confirmed that Russia has hit some Ukrainian military training sites, killing personnel. It's the kind of thing air defenses can try to prevent, but Ukraine has suffered shortages throughout the war. Ukraine has also successfully hit Russian bases and gatherings of Russian personnel.\n\nThe key is to prevent Russia from gaining sufficient knowledge of the school to target it. Its steps include \"everyone who works at KK&A, including the cleaners,\" having to do a polygraph security interview.\n\nHe said they don't share any information about the location of the training center or about the appearance of the instructors or cadets.\n\n\"Some of our employees may have relatives or acquaintances in occupied territories who could be tortured by Russians for indirect contact with someone who opposes Russia,\" Pervak said. \"This secrecy also protects the instructors and cadets themselves, as well as their relatives, from attacks by Russian agents.\"\n\nHe said that while the added security \"hinders publicity to some extent — good things should be spoken about loudly — war dictates its own conditions. We are well aware that failing to observe the principles of secrecy may result in the death of staff or cadets.\"\n\nViktor Taran, the CEO of the Kruk Drones UAV training center, said that \"Russia is interested in destroying us.\"\n\n\"Thanks to God and air defence, we're still operating.\"",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW (AP) — President Vladimir Putin emphasized Friday that Moscow’s troops were advancing across the battlefield in Ukraine and voiced confidence the Kremlin would achieve its goals militarily if Kyiv doesn't agree to Russia's conditions in peace talks.\n\nSpeaking at his tightly orchestrated annual news conference that lasted about 4 1/2 hours, Putin declared that Russian forces have “fully seized strategic initiative” and would make more gains by year's end.\n\nIn the early days of the conflict in 2022, Ukraine's forces thwarted an attempt by Russia’s larger, better-equipped army, to capture the capital of Kyiv. But the fighting soon settled into grinding battles, and Moscow's troops have made slow and steady progress over the years. Putin frequently touts this progress — even though it's not the lightning advance many expected.\n\n“Our troops are advancing all across the line of contact, faster in some areas or slower in some others, but the enemy is retreating in all sectors,” Putin said at the live news conference, which is combined with a nationwide call-in show that offers Russians across the country the opportunity to ask questions of their leader.\n\nPutin, 73, has ruled the country for 25 years and uses the event to cement his power and air his views on domestic and global affairs during a broadcast that mixes criticism of the West with promises of more social payments. Although he is sometimes asked about his personal life, he gives scant details.\n\nThis year, the news conference took place against the backdrop of a peace plan in Ukraine put forward by U.S. President Donald Trump. Despite the extensive diplomatic push, Washington’s efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands from Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nWhile the event has previously focused heavily on domestic questions — and has offered Putin a chance to expound on topics from the price of eggs to water cuts — Ukraine dominated it this year. Since it is highly choreographed, that could reflect the Kremlin’s desire to assuage the public after nearly four years of fighting.\n\nRussian demands remain unchanged\n\nPutin praised Trump's peace efforts and reaffirmed that Moscow was ready for a peaceful settlement that would address the “root causes” of the conflict, a reference to the Kremlin’s tough conditions for a deal. He said he has agreed to make “certain compromises” and “uneasy decisions” at the Alaska summit with Trump in August but didn't elaborate.\n\nHe wants all the areas in four key regions captured by his forces, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory. He has also insisted that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in eastern Ukraine that Moscow’s forces haven’t captured yet. Kyiv has publicly rejected all these demands.\n\nThe Kremlin has also insisted that Ukraine abandon its bid to join NATO and warned that it wouldn't accept the deployment of any troops from members of the military alliance members and would view them as “legitimate target.”\n\nPutin also has repeatedly said Ukraine must limit the size of its army and give official status to the Russian language — demands he has made from the outset of the conflict.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine’s bid to join NATO if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to alliance members. But at the same time, he has emphasized that Ukraine believes NATO membership remains the best security guarantee.\n\n″The United States don’t see us in NATO, for now,\" Zelenskyy said this week. “Politicians change.”\n\nCommenting on Zelenskyy's statement that he was ready to call a presidential election if a ceasefire is established, Putin responded that Russia has held elections without demanding a truce. He said that Moscow was ready to consider the issue and could agree to halt attacks deep inside Ukraine on the election day, but noted that millions of Ukrainians living in Russia must have the right to vote. Ukraine introduced martial law banning elections, but Russia hasn't made such a move.\n\nPutin rebuffed Western claims about purported Russian plans to attack European nations as “sheer nonsense” aimed at deflecting public attention from domestic problems.\n\nHe particularly singled out NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte for his statements about the Kremlin's aggressive intentions, pointing out Trump's recently published national security strategy that doesn’t name Russia as a direct adversary. “How can you prepare NATO for a war with Russia if the main member of NATO doesn't consider us as an enemy?” Putin said.\n\nHe alleged that European elites “impudently” backed Trump's Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election and now hope the U.S. political landscape will change after the midterm elections to Congress, helping raise pressure on the White House.\n\nPutin says seizing Russian assets will backfire\n\nAs it faces grinding Russian advances across the front line and relentless attacks on its energy facilities, Ukraine desperately cash infusions from its Western allies.\n\nOn Friday, European Union leaders agreed to provide a massive interest-free loan, but they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds.\n\nThe leaders tried to reassure Belgium, where most of the frozen assets are held, that they would protect it from any retaliation from Moscow if it backed the plan, but the leaders eventually opted to borrow the money on capital markets.\n\nUsing Russian assets to help Kyiv would have amounted to “robbery,” Putin said, adding that the move would have spooked investors, “dealing not only an image blow but undermining confidence in the eurozone.”\n\nPutin says troop numbers are strong\n\nPutin said the flow of volunteer soldiers has remained strong, topping 400,000 this year. It was not possible to independently verify that claim since little is known about the recruitment effort.\n\nBut the government offers relatively high pay and extensive benefits that have helped swell troop ranks. The Kremlin says it exclusively relies on volunteers to fight in Ukraine, but some media reports and rights groups have said that military officers often coerce conscripts into signing military contracts.\n\nAsked by a soldier’s widow about slow pension payments, Putin apologized and vowed the issue would be quickly resolved — a typical exchange at the annual event, which he often uses to show his command of a wide array of subjects and his ability to solve problems.\n\nThe news conference featured questions from journalists in the Gostinny Dvor amphitheater as well as via video links from across Russia. A young man in a red bow tie who held a placard saying he wanted to get married used his question to Putin to propose to his girlfriend. Later, one of the anchors hosting the event reported that she had answered “yes,” and Putin joked about collecting money for the wedding.",

    "fullText": "Dec. 19 (UPI) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Polish President Karol Nawrocki discussed mutual concerns during a private meeting in Warsaw on Friday.\n\nThe meeting was the first between the two European leaders since Nawrocki was inaugurated as Poland's new president on Aug. 6, and they discussed security matters largely involving Russia, along with economic concerns and historical issues, according to the Kyiv Independent.\n\nZelensky said the meeting was the start of a new chapter for the relationship between the two nations and is \"bad news for Russia.\"\n\n\"I very much hope that this visit opens a new and even more substantial chapter in our relations -- the relations between Ukraine and Poland, the relations not merely of neighbors, but of two European pillars without which there will simply be no freedom in our part of Europe, because there will be no security,\" Zelensky told media afterward during a joint press conference.\n\n\"Russia wants discord, wants to destroy and dismantle such a strong alliance -- the alliance of two peoples of many generations of Ukraine and Poland,\" Zelensky said. \"We will not allow them to do this.\"\n\nHe said Ukrainian and Polish independence deters Russian aggression in Eastern Europe but warned that Russia would continue into Poland if Ukraine were to fall amid the nearly four-year war there that began when Russia invaded on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nNawrocki said Poland has supported Ukraine during the war and might exchange MiG-29 fighters in return for Ukrainian drone technology.\n\nPoland's president has criticized Ukraine's desire to join the European Union and NATO, both of which Poland is a member state.\n\nThe two presidents also discussed the Volyn massacres of 1943-1944, during which Ukrainian Insurgent Army members killed tens of thousands of Poles in Nazi-occupied territory in western Ukraine.\n\nRetaliatory attacks caused the deaths of thousands of Ukrainians, and the historical conflict remains a source of tension between Polish and Ukrainian leaders.\n\nThe meeting between the two presidents followed Zelensky's trip to Belgium, where he met with European Union leaders in Brussels and secured a $105.5 billion, interest-free loan for Ukraine.\n\nThe loan is in place of allocating funds to Ukraine from frozen Russian assets, which EU leaders considered but declined after failing to reach a consensus.\n\nZelensky said the loaned money will either help fund Ukraine's defense against Russia or support rebuilding the nation if Russia agrees to a peace deal and ends its aggression, The Independent reported.",

    "fullText": "Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing for his annual televised Q&A session, and a new poll shows Russians remain focused on two issues: the war and the economy.\n\nAccording to a poll of 1,608 Russians conducted by the independent Levada Center, the top two concerns Russians want to raise with Putin are when the war will end and how they're supposed to cope with a deteriorating economy.\n\nAbout a fifth of respondents said they would ask Putin when the war in Ukraine, which the Kremlin calls a \"special military operation,\" would end.\n\nRight behind the war is the economy, as another 16% say their top question is about living standards — salaries, pensions, and benefits.\n\nThese two concerns have topped Levada's polls ahead of Putin's annual Q&A for three years.\n\nBeyond the top concerns, Levada found that 8% of respondents want to ask Putin about price growth and tax hikes, 6% about utilities and social services, and 5% about the healthcare system.\n\nThe anxiety comes as Russia's inflation remains high, and the country's massive defense spending jostles with social spending.\n\nPutin's televised \"Direct Line\" Q&A session, scheduled for Friday, comes nearly four years after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, triggering sweeping Western sanctions.\n\nSince the invasion in February 2022, the Kremlin has steered the country onto a wartime economic footing.\n\nHeavy defense spending and state-directed investment have helped sustain headline economic growth, even as sanctions and export restrictions have reshaped trade flows.\n\nBut strains are showing: Energy export revenues have dropped in a softer oil-price environment, while high inflation continues to sap consumer demand.\n\nPrevious hourslong \"Direct Line\" broadcasts offer a preview of how Putin may handle the questions the Kremlin allows.\n\nLast year, Putin acknowledged that Russia's economy was overheating amid high inflation and warned citizens to brace for continued pressure.\n\nHowever, he deflected blame, suggesting that both the central bank and the Russian federal government — formally headed by the prime minister — could have acted more decisively to prevent the surge in prices and credit growth.\n\nPutin is also expected to hold an end-of-year news conference on Friday, where the spotlight will be on any signals he offers about the direction of the war.",

    "description": "In the last year, Ukraine's interceptors have gone from novel technology to being produced in the thousands every month.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's defense ministry said on Thursday that it has been supplying its troops with roughly 950 interceptor drones every day since the beginning of December.\n\nIn its statement, the ministry said these drones were specifically to \"counter enemy Shahed-type UAVs.\"\n\nReaching nearly 1,000 daily delivered interceptors is a significant milestone for the production of such drones, which were largely still in prototyping stages at the start of the year.\n\nThese interceptors are first-person-view drones designed to fly into and destroy enemy aerial systems, typically using explosives or direct impact. A typical interceptor drone flies with four motor-powered propellers, but unlike the usual quadcopters, it is often shaped like a bullet or a rocket.\n\nInitially built to destroy high-flying reconnaissance craft, they've since been evolved by Ukrainians to take down long-range attack drones at a low cost — primarily as a response to Russia launching large waves of Iranian-designed Shaheds this year.\n\n\"These systems strengthen protection against drone terror while preserving resources for intercepting cruise and ballistic missiles,\" Ukraine's defense minister, Denys Shmyhal, said in Thursday's announcement.\n\nThe defense ministry also said it's been working with more than 10 interceptor manufacturers and has placed more orders for next year.\n\nFor Ukraine, interceptors must be fast enough to chase down drones such as the Shahed-136, which flies at a typical speed of 115 mph, while remaining cheap so that Kyiv's troops can sustainably use hundreds of them a day. Russia has recently been attacking with roughly 5,500 Shahed-type drones a month.\n\nSome Ukrainian drone makers have also been attempting to develop interceptors that can catch the Geran-3, the Russian version of the jet-powered Shahed-238, which can reportedly fly at an estimated 230 mph.\n\nUkraine's new production capacity comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in November that his country was producing roughly 600 to 800 interceptors a day, falling short of his initial goal.\n\nIn July, Zelenskyy had set a production target of 1,000 interceptors a day.\n\nUkraine's volunteer movements directly sponsor some interceptor drones for select military units, though their quantity is often limited compared to the scale of what the Ukrainian government provides.\n\nFor example, deliveries of the Wild Hornets' Sting, a $2,500 interceptor, were mostly sponsored this year by the Sternenko Foundation, a local crowdfunding organization.",

    "description": "Russia disclosed several new figures on Wednesday, including how much it's specifically spent on the war and how many soldiers it hired in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Russia's defense ministry broadcast its wide-ranging annual review on Wednesday of the Ukraine war, providing clues about its military goals and performance this year.\n\nAndrei Belousov, the Russian defense minister, presented the official statistics during the Defense Ministry Board's expanded meeting in Moscow.\n\nBusiness Insider could not independently verify the defense ministry's claims, which often differ significantly from those of international observers. Russia's leader, Vladimir Putin, said at the meeting that the Kremlin's troops were \"crushing\" Ukraine, despite the war dragging on for nearly four years.\n\nThe disclosures also come as Russia has sought to project strength and demanded heavy concessions from Ukraine while negotiating potential peace terms with the Trump administration.\n\nHowever, Belousov's presentation offers insight into Russia's ambitions for the war and its official narratives surrounding how it fights and plans to fight next year. Several new official figures were also announced.\n\nHere are 10 highlights from Belousov's end-of-year review.\n\nBelousov said that Russia's war spending is on track to reach about 5.1% of the country's GDP in 2025, out of an overall defense budget that reaches 7.3% of its annual GDP.\n\nThe country's nominal GDP in 2024 was about 201.2 trillion rubles, and is expected to grow 1% this year to about 203 trillion rubles, or $2.52 trillion.\n\nRussian independent media, however, reported that the economic ministry has forecast a GDP of about $2.7 trillion for the year.\n\nA war budget of 5.1% would therefore be somewhere between $128 billion and $137.7 billion.\n\nThis is the first time Russia has publicly disclosed the amount that it spends specifically on the war. Previously, the Kremlin only announced figures for total defense spending.\n\nThe US, by comparison, is planning to spend $901 billion on its military, or about 3.4% of its GDP.\n\nBelousov said that his ministry delivered roughly 38,000 motorcycles, buggies, and all-terrain vehicles to its troops on the front lines in 2025.\n\n\"This is 10 times more than last year,\" he said, adding that Russia plans to reach \"full strength\" in these vehicles next year.\n\nRussian troops have increasingly been using motorcycles, quad bikes, and other small, unarmored vehicles to assault or approach Ukrainian positions, trying to use their speed and small size to avoid drone attacks.\n\nUkrainians have also adopted the tactic, with one regiment even establishing an official motorcycle attack company in May.\n\nBelousov said that Russia hired 409,611 new contract soldiers in 2025, down from 449,243 in 2024.\n\nHowever, that already exceeds the Kremlin's 403,000 person recruitment goal for the year.\n\n\"Nearly two-thirds of them were young men under 40,\" Belousov said of the new recruits. \"More than a third have higher or specialized secondary education.\"\n\nUkraine and Russia have both been hard-pressed to fill their ranks as Moscow pressures Kyiv's forces with a continuous grind of frontal infantry assaults.\n\nTo maintain its flow of troops, Russia often entices recruits with hefty sign-on bonuses or pardons for crimes committed in the country.\n\nBelousov said that about 50% of Ukrainian casualties from Russian attacks come from first-person-view drones, or FPV drones. These are the small quadcopters mounted with explosives that have become a hallmark of the war.\n\nIn the summer, Russia said that it was outproducing Ukraine on FPV drones, though Kyiv's officials have since said their country has caught back up.\n\nUkrainian leaders have said that 70% of all casualties inflicted during the war involved FPV drones.\n\nBelousov said that Russia plans to create a new drone formation called the Unmanned Systems Forces next year, which would train \"tens of thousands\" of people.\n\nRussia has already created an official drone unit called Rubicon, which was formed last August to prioritize fighting with FPV drones and has often been described as fielding its most elite pilots.\n\nNow, Moscow appears to be trying to make such warfare an official pillar of its fighting force.\n\nBelousov said the Kremlin needed to transition FPV drone attacks from individual tasks carried out by each unit to \"integrated joint operations\" among its forces.\n\nUkraine launched its own Unmanned Systems Forces last year, appointing the previous commander of the elite unit, Magyar Birds, as its leader.\n\nRoughly 27,400 Ukrainian long-range drones were intercepted this year over Russian territory, with the bulk appearing after the summer, Belousov said.\n\nBelousov said that Ukraine initially began sending about 1,000 drones a month into Russia, but that the monthly number began hitting 3,700 by May.\n\nThe defense minister claimed that Russia's interception rate \"averages 97%\" for the year.\n\nUkraine has typically used fixed-wing drones to attack deeper into Russia, targeting what it says are oil and gas facilities and military production sites.\n\nUkrainian kamikaze \"drones\" aka converted Ukrainian-produced Aeroprakt A-22 Foxbat light aircraft.\n\nThese drones can reportedly deliver 300kg warheads at a range around 2000 - 3000 km.\n\nIt's believed that similar drones were recently used to hit a Shahed drone manufacturing… pic.twitter.com/8xw6BzoZvO\n\nNotably, Belousov mentioned that Russia has also been exploring FPV drones that can serve as high-speed interceptors, a technology that Ukraine has been refining to counter Moscow's Shahed waves.\n\nBelousov said that Russia received two Tu-160Ms, which are modernized, supersonic bombers that can deploy nuclear weapons or powerful stealth missiles.\n\nThat's a clue about the production rate of the bombers, which are part of a small fleet that forms a vital pillar of Russia's nuclear triad. Several of Russia's older bombers were reported severely damaged in Operation Spiderweb, an audacious Ukrainian drone attack in early June that targeted a fleet of about 41 warplanes.\n\nUkrainian sources claimed that several Tu-160s were also hit, although this was not confirmed by independent open-source intelligence at the time.\n\nRussia's military also appears to be modifying its organizational structure.\n\nBelousov said that the Kremlin had created five new divisions, 13 new brigades, and 30 new regiments in 2025. International think tanks estimate that Russian divisions can consist of between 10,000 and 20,000 troops, while regiments within typically have about 2,000 soldiers and are further split into battalions.\n\nBrigades, which typically exist as a separate formation, often have about 3,500 to 4,500 troops.\n\nBelousov said this new structure included a new division, called the Aerospace Forces, which has a regiment \"equipped with the unique S-500 antiaircraft missile system, capable of striking targets in near space.\"\n\nNext year, the Kremlin plans to add four more divisions, 14 brigades, and 39 new regiments, he added.\n\nSome of these figures encompass formations that Russia has transformed, so they aren't necessarily an indicator of how widely Russia is expanding its military organization structure. For example, Belousov said two marine brigades were turned into a single division.\n\nBelousov said that Russia had expanded its use of drones and all-terrain vehicles to deliver gear from a \"one-time operation\" in 2024 to carrying 12,000 tons of cargo this year to the front lines.\n\n\"By 2026, this figure must be at least doubled,\" he said.\n\nBoth Ukraine and Russia have been developing uncrewed ground vehicles, or ground-based drones, that can be remotely operated to deliver supplies to the front line or even conduct assaults.\n\nThe emerging technology is especially useful for dangerous tasks that would otherwise have to be filled by a human soldier.\n\nSome military units have also reported using drones to deliver equipment by air, such as one Ukrainian commander who said his forces used drones to send an e-bike to a stranded soldier.\n\nBelousov's presentation made it clear that Russia has been conducting precision strikes against Ukraine's power facilities.\n\nMore than 70% of Ukraine's thermal power plants and 37% of its hydroelectric plants have been disabled, Belousov said.\n\n\"The effectiveness of Russian precision strikes is about 60%, which is an order of magnitude higher than the effectiveness of Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory,\" Belousov said.\n\n\"Ukraine's energy capacity has been reduced by more than half,\" he added.\n\nAttacking energy infrastructure is a war crime if it's found to be intentionally carried out to cause harm to civilians. Ukraine's besieged power grid is especially crucial, as it's essential for keeping its citizens warm during harsh winters.\n\nBelousov said the strikes on energy facilities were targeting the Ukrainian military, and that disabling the grid cut off power to Kyiv's forces.\n\nHowever, the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said last September that Russian attacks on Ukraine's power grid were found to be severely affecting civilians and had \"disproportionately impacted\" vulnerable groups.\n\nUkraine also carries out attacks on Russian oil and gas facilities, though it said its aim is to cripple Moscow's ability to export energy and sustain war production.",

    "fullText": "In November, a train carrying almost 500 people came to a sudden halt in eastern Poland. A broken overhead line had smashed several windows, and the track ahead was damaged. Elsewhere on the line, explosives detonated under a passing freight train.\n\nNo one was hurt in either case and the damage was limited, but Poland, which blamed the attack on Russia’s intelligence services, responded forcefully: It deployed 10,000 troops to protect critical infrastructure.\n\nThe sabotage in Poland is one of 145 incidents in an Associated Press database that Western officials say are part of a campaign of disruption across Europe masterminded by Russia. Officials say the campaign — waged since President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 — aims to deprive Kyiv of support, create divisions among Europeans and identify the continent's security weak spots.\n\nSo far in this hybrid war, most known acts of sabotage have resulted in minimal damage — nothing compared to the tens of thousands of lives lost and cities decimated across Ukraine.\n\nBut officials say each act — from vandalism of monuments to cyberattacks to warehouse fires — sucks up valuable security resources. The head of one large European intelligence service said investigations into Russian interference now swallow up as much of the agency’s time as terrorism.\n\nWhile the campaign places a heavy burden on European security services, it costs Russia next to nothing, officials say. That’s because Moscow is carrying out cross-border operations that require European countries to cooperate extensively on investigations — while often using foreigners with criminal backgrounds as cheap proxies for Russian intelligence operatives. That means Moscow notches up a win just by tying up resources — even when plots aren’t successful.\n\n“It’s a 24/7 operation between all the services to stop it,” said a senior European intelligence official, who like the head of the European intelligence service and other officials who spoke to AP insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive security matters.\n\nOver the course of the year, AP spoke to more than 40 European and NATO officials from 13 countries to document the scope of this hybrid war, including incidents on its map only when linked by Western officials to Russia, its proxies or its ally Belarus.\n\nPutin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told AP that Russia doesn't have “any connection” with the campaign.\n\nAP’s map tracking Russian sabotage and disruption\n\nAP’s database shows a spike in arson and explosives plots from one in 2023 to 26 in 2024. Six have been documented so far in 2025. Three vandalism cases were recorded last year, meanwhile, and one this year.\n\nThe data is incomplete since not all incidents are made public, and it can take officials months to establish a link to Moscow. But the spike matches what officials have warned: The campaign is growing more dangerous.\n\nThe countries most frequently targeted, according to the map, border Russia: Poland and Estonia. Several incidents have also occurred in Latvia, the U.K., Germany and France. All are major supporters of Ukraine.\n\nThe European official, a senior Baltic intelligence official and another intelligence official said the campaign noticeably calmed in late 2024 and early this year. Their analysis showed Moscow likely paused the campaign to curry favor with U.S. President Donald Trump's new administration. It has since resumed at full pace.\n\n“They are back to business,” the European official said.\n\nMulticountry plots drain resources\n\nThe man officials say was behind the attack on the Polish railway that carries supplies to Ukraine is Yevgeny Ivanov — a Ukrainian convicted of working with Russian military intelligence to plot arson attacks at home improvement stores, a cafe and a drone factory in Ukraine, according to court documents.\n\nIvanov, who left Poland after the attack there, worked for Yury Sizov, an officer from Russia's GRU military intelligence service, according to Ukraine’s security service.\n\nIvanov was convicted in absentia in Ukraine but managed to enter Poland because Ukraine did not inform Polish officials of his conviction, Polish Interior Minister Marcin Kierwiński said. Ukraine’s security service said it closely cooperates with allies.\n\nStaging plots that involve perpetrators from several countries or who have crossed borders drains investigatory resources from multiple authorities across Europe — one of Moscow’s key goals, according to Estonian State Prosecutor Triinu Olev-Aas.\n\nOver the last year, she said the profile of attackers in Estonia has changed from locals largely known to law enforcement to unknown foreigners. That requires increased cooperation among countries to disrupt plots or detain perpetrators.\n\nFor two attacks in January — fires set at a supermarket and a Ukrainian restaurant — the people hired had never been to Estonia before, Olev-Aas said.\n\nAt the restaurant, a Moldovan man smashed a window, threw in a can of gasoline and set it alight. Video showed his arm on fire as he ran away.\n\nThe man and his accomplice fled through Latvia, Lithuania and Poland before being caught in Italy.\n\nWhile Russian intelligence officers might be the masterminds of such operations, they frequently rely on recruiters — often with convictions or criminal connections — who assign tasks to saboteurs on the ground, the Baltic official said.\n\nOutsourcing to people with criminal backgrounds, like Ivanov, means Russia doesn’t have to risk highly trained intelligence operatives — agents Moscow often doesn’t have recourse to anyway since European countries kicked out scores of spies as relations nosedived in recent years.\n\nRussian criminal networks offer a ready-made alternative, the Baltic official said.\n\nThe European official said the man accused of coordinating a plot to put explosives in packages on cargo planes, for example, was recruited by Russian intelligence after involvement with smuggling guns and explosives. The man is linked to at leastfour other plots.\n\nOther people are recruited from European prisons or soon after they're released, the Baltic official said.\n\nIn one case, the Museum of the Occupation of Latvia, dedicated to the Soviet Union’s occupation of the country, was set on fire by someone released from prison the previous month.\n\nGreater strain, greater cooperation\n\nEven plots that are foiled are a win for Moscow because they test defenses and waste resources.\n\nIn 2024, a Ukrainian man, working on the orders of Russian military intelligence, dug up a cache of items buried in a cemetery in Lithuania, including drone parts and cans of corn filled with explosives.\n\nOfficials believe the plan was to rig the drones with the explosives. The plot was eventually foiled — but not before considerable resources were used to track down everyone involved, said Jacek Dobrzyński, the spokesperson for Poland’s security minister.\n\nThe sheer number of plots is overstretching some law enforcement agencies, but Moscow’s campaign has also fostered greater cooperation, the European official said.\n\nProsecutors in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia have created joint investigation teams for attacks organized by foreign intelligence services, said Mārtiņš Jansons, a special prosecutor in Latvia.\n\nIn the U.K., front-line police officers are being trained to spot suspicious incidents that may be state-backed, said Cmdr. Dominic Murphy, head of the counterterrorism squad at the Metropolitan Police.\n\nHe noted a trainee detective flagged an arson attack at a warehouse in London after realizing the business was owned by Ukrainians and contained communications devices used by the military. Police determined the attack was organized by Russian intelligence.\n\nBut officials warn Russia is continually testing new methods.\n\nSmugglers in Russia’s ally Belarus have sent hundreds of weather balloons carrying cigarettes into Lithuania and Poland, repeatedly forcing the Lithuanian capital’s airport to shut in what authorities called a hybrid attack.\n\n“Nowadays they only carry cigarettes,\" Dobrzyński warned, \"but in future they could carry other things.\"",

That approach may be used again for future titles in the franchise, according to developer Motoi Okamoto.\n\"We believe we could perhaps take similar approaches with other cultures across the globe,\" Okamoto told Inverse through a translator. \"For example, in Central or South America, we could perhaps tap into the more local, shamanistic beliefs and see how that ties in. But we could also try to expand our horizons and look into other regions, like possibly Russia, Italy, or South Korea, because all those areas have their own unique types of belief systems.",

    "fullText": "Russian state TV host Vladimir Solovyov added to fears that a larger war will break out in Europe when he took to the airwaves on Tuesday and listed multiple countries Russia should “destroy” and “liberate.”\n\n“Once again, we will have to destroy Berlin, and enter this godforsaken city,” Solovyov said. “Once again, we will have to enter Paris. Once again, we will have to liberate Vienna. Well, perhaps the Austrians will reconsider. It doesn’t mean that we want this. But one of the principles postulated by our supreme commander-in-chief is when we are forced to act, then we act.”\n\nSolovyov’s rant followed him as he traveled to the Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk for a propaganda hit last week. Russian President Vladimir Putin has so far been unable to capture the city in its years-long conflict with Ukraine.\n\nSolovyov’s rant also dropped as concerns are growing about Russia possibly targeting another country on top of their invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto cautioned this week that tensions are escalating with Russia and Europe would not survive a war.\n\n“Freezing Russian assets was already a serious step, but using those assets goes even further. This is a war provocation of an unprecedented scale,” he said about the EU using frozen Russian assets. “Therefore, at today’s Foreign Affairs Council, I will make it clear that for Hungary, the risk of further escalation is unacceptable. Simply because if a war were to break out between Europe and Russia, Europe would not survive it.”\n\nBrussels wants to send another €210 billion to Ukraine, including around €115 billion for weapons.\n\nThe EU is disregarding its own rules by planning to finance this package through frozen Russian assets.

Mark Rutte, secretary general of the NATO alliance, made a similar warning.\n\n“The shadow of war is knocking on Europe’s door and that war could be bigger and bloodier than what we have experienced in recent times,” Rutte said.\n\nSolovyov has gone on fiery, scorched-Earth rants in the past, openly fantasizing in July about a nuclear attack on the United States.\n\n“It doesn’t mean that we want this. But one of the principles postulated by our supreme commander-in-chief is when we are forced to act then we act. First, of course, the principle of ‘do no harm’ but then…please don’t blame us,” Solovyov said on Tuesday.\n\nWhile speaking in Moscow this week, Putin denied Russian plans to invade Europe, dismissing warnings to prepare for potential war as “hysteria.”\n\nThe post Putin Ally Names European Countries Russia Will ‘Destroy’ as World War III Fears Loom first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Moscow's wartime pivot to Beijing has helped keep Russia's economy afloat under the weight of sweeping Western sanctions — but at a cost.\n\nWhat looks like a lifeline today may lock Moscow into a long-term role as Beijing's junior economic partner. Russia is now heavily dependent on China for key manufactured goods and advanced inputs blocked by Western sanctions, according to a report from the Atlantic Council, a think tank, published on Friday.\n\n\"Economically and politically, Russia's relationship with China is simultaneously deeply asymmetrical and mutually beneficial,\" wrote Elina Ribakova, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and Lucas Risinger, an economic analyst and nonresident research fellow at the Kyiv School of Economics Institute.\n\nChina buys up Russian oil at volumes that offset lost European customers — at a discount — while Russia buys machinery, vehicles, and electronics from the East Asian giant amid Western boycotts and sanctions.\n\n\"This is a complete and embarrassing reversal in the relationship compared to the 2000s, when Russia exported higher value-added goods to China,\" wrote the analysts.\n\nSince Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Kremlin has steered the country's economy into a wartime footing. Heavy defense and government spending help sustain topline resilience, despite sanctions and export restrictions.\n\nBut cracks are emerging as energy export revenues have fallen sharply in a low oil-price environment. Consumer demand has also weakened amid still high inflation.\n\nChina now accounts for a large share of Russia's imports, and the vast majority of its trade with China is settled in the Chinese yuan.\n\nRussia became China's top crude oil supplier in 2023, but the country accounts for just one-fifth of China's imports of the commodity. Meanwhile, oil and gas revenues account for a substantial one-third of Russia's budget inflows.\n\nTo be sure, China needs global buyers for its massive manufacturing sector, and Russia has become one of them. Still, the gains are \"far more important to Russia than to China,\" since Beijing doesn't rely on Moscow the way Europe relied on Russian energy, wrote the analysts.\n\nFurthermore, \"from an economic point of view, China is not a better trading partner for Russia than the European Union was. It buys oil and gas at lower prices, it invests far less in Russia, and its products are often technologically inferior,\" they added.\n\nThis skewed relationship gives Beijing substantial leverage in negotiations and transactions. China purchases Russian oil at steep discounts, knowing Moscow's alternatives are limited.\n\n\"While Moscow has not become Beijing's vassal — at least not to the extent that it would attack NATO purely to distract the Alliance from a war for Taiwan — Russia is certainly the junior partner in the 'no limits' partnership,\" the analysts wrote.",

Russia is now heavily dependent on China for key manufactured goods and advanced inputs blocked by Western sanctions, according to a report from the Atlantic Council, a think tank, published on Friday.\n\n\"Economically and politically, Russia's relationship with China is simultaneously deeply asymmetrical and mutually beneficial,\" wrote Elina Ribakova, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and Lucas Risinger, an economic analyst and nonresident research fellow at the Kyiv School of Economics Institute.\n\nChina buys up Russian oil at volumes that offset lost European customers — at a discount — while Russia buys machinery, vehicles, and electronics from the East Asian giant amid Western boycotts and sanctions.\n\n\"This is a complete and embarrassing reversal in the relationship compared to the 2000s, when Russia exported higher value-added goods to China,\" wrote the analysts.\n\nSince Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Kremlin has steered the country's economy into a wartime footing. Heavy defense and government spending help sustain topline resilience, despite sanctions and export restrictions.\n\nBut cracks are emerging as energy export revenues have fallen sharply in a low oil-price environment. Consumer demand has also weakened amid still high inflation.\n\nChina now accounts for a large share of Russia's imports, and the vast majority of its trade with China is settled in the Chinese yuan.\n\nRussia became China's top crude oil supplier in 2023, but the country accounts for just one-fifth of China's imports of the commodity. Meanwhile, oil and gas revenues account for a substantial one-third of Russia's budget inflows.\n\nTo be sure, China needs global buyers for its massive manufacturing sector, and Russia has become one of them. Still, the gains are \"far more important to Russia than to China,\" since Beijing doesn't rely on Moscow the way Europe relied on Russian energy, wrote the analysts.",

    "fullText": "Newly captured satellite imagery shows the aftermath of a Ukrainian drone attack that targeted a Russian submarine at a naval base on the Black Sea.\n\nThe new imagery, captured on Tuesday by the US spatial intelligence firm Vantor and obtained by Business Insider, shows damage to a section of a quay at the port of Novorossiysk next to a Kilo-class submarine.\n\nUkraine's internal security agency said on Monday that it used underwater drones to strike a Russian submarine at the port in a first-of-its-kind attack. Kyiv published footage of the operation, which caused a large blast in the port, and said it damaged and disabled the boat.\n\nRussian state media, citing the Black Sea Fleet, said later on Monday that the attack failed to damage a submarine.\n\nThe satellite imagery does not appear to reveal any visible damage to a submarine; however, there could be some beneath the surface, making it difficult to determine the success of the operation.\n\nRussia's Kilo-class submarines — diesel-electric boats that have been in service since the 1980s — are used to carry out Kalibr cruise missile strikes against Ukraine, making them a high-value target for Kyiv.\n\nThe new imagery also reveals floating barriers at the entrance of the port, a tactic that Russia has used to protect its warships and infrastructure from Ukrainian naval drone attacks. However, this kind of defense is primarily aimed at surface threats, as the underwater drone was still able to enter the port and cause an explosion.\n\nUkraine has used its fleet of explosive-packed naval drones and long-range missiles to damage and destroy dozens of Russian warships and vessels since the start of the full-scale invasion.\n\nThis asymmetric campaign has forced Russia to relocate its Black Sea Fleet away from its long-held headquarters in the occupied Crimean peninsula to Novorossiysk, on the other side of the region. However, Ukraine continues to demonstrate that it can also target this port.\n\nThe attack, the latest against the Black Sea Fleet, appears to signal a new chapter in drone warfare. Ukraine has mainly relied on surface naval drones to target Russian warships.\n\nThe use of an underwater drone, compared to a slow-moving mine or torpedo, suggests a significant expansion of Ukraine's capabilities that could pose a new threat to the Black Sea Fleet.\n\nConflict analysts at the Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank, wrote in a battlefield assessment on Monday that Russia had docked its Kilo-class submarines in Crimea but moved them to Novorossiysk several years ago because of Ukraine's strike campaign.\n\nThe recent underwater drone attack \"shows that Ukrainian forces continue to modernize and optimize their unmanned capabilities such that Ukraine can strike Russian military targets at a range that Russian forces previously thought safe,\" the analysts said.",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union on Monday slapped sanctions on five businessmen linked to Russian state-owned oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft and targeted companies accused of circumventing sanctions on Russian oil by running ships for Moscow's shadow fleet of aging oil tankers.\n\nOil revenue is a key part of Russia’s economy, allowing President Vladimir Putin to pour money into the war effort against Ukraine without worsening inflation for everyday people and avoiding a currency collapse.\n\nMember countries, notably France, have vowed to crack down on the sanction-busting shadow fleet which experts estimate numbers over 400 ships. They are also trying to secure deals with flag-carrying countries to make it easier to board the vessels.\n\nEU headquarters said the businessmen “control vessels transporting crude oil or petroleum products, originating in Russia or being exported from Russia, concealing the actual origin of the oil, while practicing irregular and high-risk shipping practices.”\n\nThe four shipping companies targeted are based in the United Arab Emirates, Vietnam and Russia. A statement said they own or manage shadow fleet tankers under sanctions and which transport oil “while practicing irregular and high-risk shipping practices.”\n\nThe sanctions, which were agreed at a meeting of the 27-nation bloc's foreign ministers in Brussels, involve mostly asset freezes and travel bans.\n\nThe EU move adds to growing pressure on the shadow fleet. Last month, Ukraine used domestically produced Sea Baby naval drones to strike two more Russian oil tankers in the Black Sea. Both were under international sanctions.\n\nSeparately, the bloc imposed sanctions on members of Russia’s military intelligence agency, GRU, and a hacking group known as Cadet Blizzard, accusing them of cyber attacks targeting Ukraine, the EU and unnamed NATO allies.\n\nThe EU also added a number of foreign policy analysts and influencers accused of promoting pro-Russian propaganda or conspiracy theories to its sanctions list.",
