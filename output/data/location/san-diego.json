    "fullText": "The San Diego Padres have a new manager for the 2026 season, and if you ask Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, that seems likely to turn the temperature down a bit in the rivalry between the two teams.\n\nOn Thursday, as pitchers and catchers start reporting for spring training in Glendale, Arizona, Marty Caswell of Foul Territory noted Roberts has “butted heads with quite a few Padres managers” and asked him if he expects that to continue.\n\nIs Dave Roberts going to butt heads with Craig Stammen as he did Mike Shildt? pic.twitter.com/7W2brKEdVo\n\n— Marty Caswell (@MartyCaswell) February 12, 2026\n\nRoberts indicated he does not think that will be the case with Craig Stammen.\n\n“I’m not going to butt heads with Stammen,” Roberts said. “No way. I just don’t see that happening. Don’t see it happening.”\n\nCaswell referenced Roberts’ previous confrontations with the Padres, perhaps the most prominent of which occurred in June.\n\nRoberts was ejected from the June 17, 2025, game with the Padres after Shohei Ohtani was plunked in the leg with a fastball.\n\nThat struck batter came one inning after Padres star Fernando Tatis Jr. was hit, and Roberts confronted the umpire after he issued warnings to both teams.\n\nThree days later, Ohtani and Tatis were hit again, prompting the benches to clear.\n\nThat night, Roberts got into it with now-former Padres manager Mike Shildt, who later seemed to admit that Ohtani was hit in retaliation for the pitch that hit Tatis.\n\nDespite the friction with his predecessor, Roberts was complimentary of Stammen, noting that despite a lack of managerial experience, his San Diego counterpart is well-regarded in the baseball world.\n\nStammen spent the last six years of his career with the Padres, prompting the San Diego Union-Tribune to dub the move “outside the box but from inside the organization.”\n\n“I was surprised in the sense of, he hasn’t coached before, but not surprised with the respect he has in the clubhouse, the game, and being familiar with the organization. Great hire,” Roberts said.\n\nFor his part, Stammen has promised the Padres will be competitive with the Dodgers, which he described as a “great team.”\n\n“We’re going to compete,” Stammen told Foul Territory earlier this year. “No doubt about that. We’re going to give them our best shot. That’s what we’ll do every year, that’s what we’re going to do every year.",

    "description": "For the first time ever, NWSL Media Day consisted of 16 teams with expansion sides Boston Legacy and Denver Summit joining: Angel City, Bay FC, Chicago Stars, Denver Summit, NJ/NY Gotham FC, Houston Dash, Kansas City Current, North Carolina Courage, Orlando Pride, Portland Thorns, Racing Louisville, San Diego Wave, Seattle Reign, Utah Royals, and Washington Spirit.",
    "fullText": "Last week, all sixteen clubs were gathered and represented for the second ever NWSL Media Day ahead of the 2026 regular season.\n\nHere are All For XI’s top moments from the 2026 NWSL Media Day:\n\nBay FC’s Jordan Silkowitz dream 2025 season\n\nA year ago, Silkowitz questioned whether she would continue playing the game at all. Today, she is Bay FC’s undisputed starter, one of the NWSL’s top-performing goalkeepers, and living out her childhood dream with the USWNT.\n\nFor more on her incredible journey, here is our latest feature.\n\nSan Diego Wave midfielder Kenza Dali isn’t sure she’ll ever quit football.\n\nHeading into her 17th professional season, the 34-year-old carries the same love for the game she felt on Day One.\n\n“You know what, it’s funny, because I’m the fittest on the team,” Dali said. “(Wave head coach Jonas Eidevall) can tell you. I look at age in terms of experience. You can’t match that. There are things in football you don’t learn on the pitch — you learn them through moments.”\n\nFull feature can be found here 🙂\n\nPortland Thorns forward Reilyn Turner just made her USWNT debut and scored her first ever goal too.\n\nShe talks to us about finding out that she had made the senior national team for the first time.\n\n“It’s a dream come true. I honestly thought it (email) was spam.”\n\nWhy Avery Patterson plays soccer\n\nUSWNT and Houston Dash defender Avery Patterson spoke about the now-stable culture she feels has been developed with the Houston Dash. The players have culture meetings with the coach every week, and speak with sports psychologists answering questions like, “Why do we play soccer?” At the end of our conversation Patterson answered exactly that question.\n\nPaige Cronin (née Monaghan) shares what being the captain and leader of Utah Royals means to her.\n\n“At first, I was scared,” said Cronin. “I’ve never done this before. For me I put a lot of pressure on myself, I try to listen to others, figure it all out. But, I think I learned through the highs and the lows.”\n\nMust Watch: Her sister’s reaction is incredible\n\nUSWNT and North Carolina Courage midfielder Riley Jackson shares her excitement to finding out she made the senior team for the first time, her sister’s hilarious reaction, and her first ever goal contribution – an assist to Trinity Rodman.\n\nRookie of the Year finalist on her storybook season\n\nAngel City FC forward Riley Tiernan talks about her special rookie season and if she’s had a chance to take in all of the wonderful success from it.\n\n“I was not expecting any of this coming out of college. It’s everything I’ve worked for. It’s something I’ve been working towards my whole life. But, to see it all fall into place and to get these small and big accomplishments has been really special.”\n\n“I would say I’m still digesting, the fact that I’m living in the best place in the world, doing what I love to do for a job.”\n\nEmeri Adames is very serious about her national holiday idea\n\nSeattle Reign forward Emeri Adames reveals her idea for a national holiday, and you better like it!\n\n“I would do National Pickle Day because I love pickles so much. I think everyone should like pickles. And when they say they don’t like pickles, it makes me mad.”\n\nSan Diego Wave defender Kennedy Wesley reveals while at Target, she found out that she had made the USWNT.\n\n“It was really exciting. I had gotten an email but I don’t check it as frequently as I should. So I was a little bit late, but I saw it when I was with my mom at Target. We were both through the roof, very surprised, very full of excitement and gratitude.”\n\n2025 NWSL Midfielder of the Year\n\nNorth Carolina Courage star Manaka Matsukubo shares what it means to be honored with that award and gives plenty of love to her teammates and family.\n\n“I am honored. However, it’s not just me, it’s my teammates.”\n\nWashington Spirit and USWNT forward, and California native Trinity Rodman talks her excitement about playing at home for the 2028 LA Olympics.\n\n“It always is like this full-circle moment because I grew up here and I started playing soccer down here.”\n\n“I’m so excited. I’m going to have a lot of people, so I better start getting tickets ready for it.”\n\nJordyn Bloomer stole the show in the NWSL in 2025 and will be a player to look out for this season as well.\n\nHowever, her journey has been filled with adversity, patience, and so much more, but she has gotten past all of it. Now, she is shining brighter than ever.\n\nThe goalkeeper discussed her unique journey with us.\n\nCalifornia native Onyeka Gamero shares what it means to be coming back to her home state and join the NWSL.\n\n“I remember saying, ‘I want to be back in the U.S., I’ll go anywhere.’ But of course being in California – my parents right there, everything is so familiar.”\n\n“It just feels nice. I feel good. For me as a player, I feel like that’s where it starts, just feeling ok.”\n\nWashington Spirit star midfielder Croix Bethune shares some of the key details from her conversation with USWNT head coach Emma Hayes.\n\nCasey Murphy made a big move to the Boston Legacy joining as a free agent goalkeeper. One of the reasons she gave at NWSL media day was the titles. Boston is a city that notoriously cares deeply about their sports. Mistakes can linger in the minds of players and fans with the pressure, here’s what Murphy had to say on the matter.\n\nDid Utah Royals forward Mina Tanaka come up with the greatest holiday ever?",

    "title": "San Diegan Xander Schauffele makes a case for Torrey Pines having prominent spot on future PGA Tour schedule",
    "description": "Xander Schauffele thinks that his hometown of San Diego and the Torrey Pines golf courses likely will remain in a prominent place on the PGA Tour's schedule in the future",
    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO — Xander Schauffele was born in a hospital in La Jolla that is 2½ miles from the clubhouse at the Torrey Pines golf municipal courses. He played high school and college golf atop the cliffs, built a dream home eight miles away and has competed in the Farmers Insurance Open in every season he’s been a pro, save last year when he was dealing with an injury.\n\nSo, yes, he’ll be the first to admit he’s biased when it comes to seeing Torrey Pines and San Diego remain on the PGA Tour schedule in perpetuity—at a time when there is so much speculation about which tournaments will remain and which will disappear when the Future Competitions Committee (FCC) makes it recommendations sometime in the next few months.\n\nOn Tuesday, ahead of Thursday’s start of the last San Diego tournament that will be sponsored by Farmers Insurance, Schauffele admitted that he’s hardly the guy tying himself to a Torrey pine tree to save the event. But he also doesn’t seem overly concerned that the tournament is in danger of going away.\n\n“I think I would feel like Torrey's safe if you kind of look at the schedule, just from it should find a home because this property's iconic,” said the 10-time tour winner. “It's a beautiful property, it's a big property, it's a tough golf course, and it usually has pretty good winners on it.”\n\nSchauffele then pointed out the impact that Tiger Woods has had on Torrey Pines, and vice versa. Woods, who happens to lead the FCC, won here eight times, including the epic 2008 U.S. Open, and in turn, people flock to the site from all over the world and television viewers can likely recall memorable holes and shots at Torrey as much as most venues on tour.\n\n“I think Tiger single-handedly has made this property incredibly special in terms of a history in golf, just tying back to the '08 U.S. Open,” said Schauffele, who on-site as a youngster and scrambling to see Woods’ incredible Sunday putt at 18 in ’08. “You look at pretty golf courses that we have on tour, I'd say Torrey's one of them. I wouldn't be shocked if it was somewhere on the schedule.\n\n“I couldn't answer when or who would want to be a sponsor or something of that nature, but I think it's a strong enough course and a big enough course, a championship course to be on the schedule still.”\n\nWith talk that the Hawaiian Swing’s season-opening tournaments on Maui and Oahu might go away permanently after this season, and with the San Diego event looking for a new sponsor, speculation turns to the remaining events on the West Coast Swing. Pebble Beach and Riviera already host signature events, leaving The American Express and San Diego as those tournaments \n\nThe Sentry, also a signature tournament and previously at Kapalua, seemingly would need a home, and The American Express is a three-course pro-am that wouldn’t appear conducive to hosting a limited field. That would seemingly leave Torrey Pines as a strong possible landing spot for The Sentry on the South Course. Tour officials are declining comment until the FCC delivers its report.\n\nFor Schauffele, with no Sentry at which to start the season, he skipped the first two events and begins at Torrey Pines, where, curiously, he has only two top-10 finishes in nine starts. He missed last year with a rib cage injury that ended up creating a sluggish start and middling play that led to him missing the Tour Championship for the first time.\n\nSchauffele called it a “bad year,” but it ended on a couple of very high notes. He and his wife, Maya, had their first child, a boy they named Victor, in late August, and in October, Schauffele shot 64 in the final round to win the Baycurrent Championship in Japan—the country in which his mother was raised.\n\nOf what it meant to get that season-ending win, Schauffele said, “We had a kid, and, obviously, I'm going to take advantage and spend as much time with him and my wife. It was a big goal of mine to play well. So, I just know myself—if I didn't play well in Japan, I would have been super pumped to be there and be present [with him family], obviously, but at the same time something would have been just scratching at the back of my head of just like, ‘you suck,’ you know what I mean? You've got to play a lot better.”",

It's always been a goal of mine to play in this league.\n\n\"I want to play in the Champions League here at London City and win many trophies.\"\n\nLondon City Lionesses, playing in the Women's Super League for the first time this season, are currently seventh.\n\nHead coach Eder Maestre added: \"I'm so excited with this signing. I really think she is one of the most exciting forwards I have seen. She is a dribbler who can take on players in one-vs-one situations, and she will be very powerful on the wing.\n\n\"Everybody can see how good she is when she plays and I want that warrior-like and winning mentality off the pitch too, to help us reach our goals.\n\n\"She has won six Champions Leagues, so she has the ambitions and the knowhow to win, on and off the pitch.\"",

Bailey Barnhard scored all 6 of her points in overtime, while Martinez got open back-door to give the Aztecs a two-possession lead midway through the extra session.\n\nThe Aztecs came out of halftime hitting almost everything from beyond the arc, as Martinez opened the third quarter by nailing back to back triples. UNLV responded with an 8-0 run that put the hosts back in front, but Panganiban kept the offense rolling by starting SDSU’s biggest scoring run of regulation.\n\nFirst she canned a 3-pointer, then Martinez got free for a driving layup as Alyssa Jackson and Panganiban made back-to-back 3’s as part of an 11-0 run and 17-8 push to start the second half. The lead grew as large as 10 points twice in the fourth quarter on a Martinez driving score and a Panganiban jumper.\n\nBut UNLV, who have won the last four regular season Mountain West titles, put together a 10-0 run over a 1:42 stretch to retake the lead with 41 seconds remaining. Mariah Elohim made two of her three 3-pointers for the game during the stretch, with Lady Rebels leading scorer kicking the run off with her 16th of 18 points of the night on a transition layup.\n\nPanganiban nailed a triple with 41 seconds left to put SDSU back in front by 1, but the Aztecs fouled Jasmyn Lott on a fast break with 18 seconds remaining, but the guard split the pair at the free-throw line. SDSU had a chance to win the game in regulation when Kennedy Lee was fouled on a put back attempt after Nala Williams’ driving attempt missed.\n\nThe win extended the Aztecs streak to 10 in a row, and was the first win in a true road game at UNLV since the 2012-13 season. San Diego State is 5-0 on the road this season and are 15-4 on the road since the beginning of last year.\n\nUp next will have a bye during the midweek round of Mountain West games, returning to action against the San José State Spartans on Saturday, Jan. 24. Tip-off is scheduled for 1 p.m. and the game will be streamed on the Mountain West Network.",

    "fullText": "A former U.S. Navy sailor convicted of selling technical and operating manuals for ships and operating systems to an intelligence officer working for China was sentenced Monday to more than 16 years in prison, prosecutors said.\n\nA federal judge in San Diego sentenced Jinchao Wei, 25, to 200 months. A federal jury convicted Wei in August of six crimes, including espionage. He was paid more than $12,000 for the information he sold, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement.\n\nWei, an engineer for the amphibious assault ship USS Essex, was one of two California-based sailors charged on Aug. 3, 2023, with providing sensitive military information to China. The other, Wenheng Zhao, was sentenced to more than two years in 2024 after he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and one count of receiving a bribe in violation of his official duties.\n\nU.S. officials have for years expressed concern about the espionage threat they say the Chinese government poses, bringing criminal cases in recent years against Beijing intelligence operatives who have stolen sensitive government and commercial information, including through illegal hacking.\n\nWei was recruited via social media in 2022 by an intelligence officer who portrayed himself as a naval enthusiast working for the state-owned China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, prosecutors said.\n\nEvidence presented in court showed Wei told a friend that the person was “extremely suspicious” and that it was “quite obviously” espionage. Wei disregarded the friend's advice to delete the contact and instead moved conversations with the intelligence officer to a different encrypted messaging app Wei believed was more secure, prosecutors said.\n\nOver the course of 18 months, Wei sent the officer photos and videos of the Essex, advised him of the location of various Navy ships and told him about the Essex's defensive weapons, prosecutors said.\n\nWei sold the intelligence officer 60 technical and operating manuals, including those for weapons control, aircraft and deck elevators. The manuals contained export control warnings and detailed the operations of multiple systems aboard the Essex and similar ships.\n\nHe was a petty officer second class, which is a enlisted sailor's rank.\n\nThe Navy's website says the Essex is equipped to transport and support a Marine Corps landing force of over 2,000 troops during an air and amphibious assault.\n\nIn a letter to the judge before sentencing, Wei apologized and said he shouldn’t have shared anything with the person who he had considered a friend. Wei said “introversion and loneliness” clouded his judgment.",

    "fullText": "Humpback whales occasionally swim to boats as if curious about their human occupants. It's a behavior described as mugging.\n\nBut on Saturday off San Diego, a humpback whale seemed more curious about a furry rescue dog named Fin – and vice versa.\n\nThe accompanying footage, captured by Gone Whale Watching San Diego, shows Fin enthusiastically greeting a humpback whale that surfaced just feet from the vessel’s bow.\n\nDominic Biagini, owner of the company, stated via Instagram: “Watching my dog fall in love with whales has been one of the great joys of my life!”\n\nThe heartwarming interaction occurred after Jess Aubry, a Gone Whale Watching San Diego captain, encountered a large pod of humpback whales during a five-hour excursion. Biagini traveled to the location with his partner, Erica Sackrison, and Fin.\n\nSackrison commented via Instagram: “Who’s watching who?”\n\nAubury remarked: “That tail is going a mile a minute.”\n\nOne follower observed that Fin seems to be the boat's only occupant.\n\nFin, a mixed yellow lab/golden retriever, was rescued by Biagini near the U.S.-San Diego border.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Rescue dog greeted by whale in heartwarming encounter off San Diego",

    "fullText": "Today, the North Carolina Courage announced that they have signed CANWNT goalkeeper Kailen Sheridan to a two-year, fully-guaranteed contract through the 2027 season.\n\n“I can’t wait to join the Courage and bring my family to North Carolina. This team’s soccer identity and tactical systems are so exciting and fit the way I like to play as well. I’m really looking forward to joining the team, getting to work on the field, and focusing on a great season this year,” said Sheridan.\n\nWidely considered one of the best goalkeepers in the world, Sheridan has consistently found herself with numerous accolades and awards. She was named to NWSL Best XI First Team in 2021 and 2022, and Second Team in 2023. The GK also took home Goalkeeper of the Year honors in 2022.\n\nIn nine seasons, she earned 42 clean sheets in 166 regular season appearances. With the San Diego Wave, she help guide them to the 2023 NWSL Shield and 2024 NWSL Challenge Cup.\n\n“We’re delighted to welcome Kailen Sheridan to the club. She is an elite goalkeeper with proven experience at the highest level, and her leadership, distribution and shot-stopping ability immediately raise the standard of our squad. Kailen brings a strong mentality and professionalism that will be invaluable both on and off the pitch, and we’re confident she will play a key role in helping us achieve our objectives moving forward,” said Courage Chief Soccer Officer Ceri Bowley.\n\nInternationally, she has 63 appearances for the Canada Women’s National Team. In 2020, with her country, won the 2020 Olympic Gold Medal. She has represented her country at two World Cups and Olympics.\n\nAfter the departure of Casey Murphy, goalkeeper became a priority for NC Courage. And now, the club just brought in one of the very best. North Carolina will be a team to watch in 2026 after narrowly missing the playoffs this past season.",

The exhibit aims to create greater empathy, understanding and appreciation towards elephants, who are also known as the “architects of the earth.”\n\nThe park’s elephant mother-daughter duo, Umngani and Mkhaya, gained international fame in 2025 when the two, along with other members of the herd, formed a protective “alert circle” during an earthquake.\n\nThe Safari Park in Escondido is home to over 3,100 animals and spans 1,800 acres. Elephant Valley will be included with Safari Park admission.",

The airport did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside local working hours.\n\nSan Diego is the third-busiest airport in California. It reported handling over 25 million passengers in 2024.\n\nWhile many of the diverted flights eventually made it to San Diego, it was likely a frustrating day for many travellers.\n\nJapan Airlines Flight 66 had flown about 10 hours from Tokyo to San Diego. After circling around the airport, it diverted to Los Angeles, a 30-minute flight away.\n\nJust over two hours later, the Boeing 787 took off again and completed the short flight down to San Diego.\n\nThe airline didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSome Southwest Airlines passengers departing Sacramento had a two-hour flight to nowhere. Flight 3138 spent an hour circling north of Los Angeles before returning to its origin, per flight-tracking data. It later took off again and reached San Diego about five hours behind schedule.\n\nWhile most flights were able to divert elsewhere in California, around a dozen of them diverted to Phoenix.\n\nA Southwest flight from Baltimore spent about an hour circling just west of the Arizona state capital before touching down there.\n\nIt was on the ground for over three hours before continuing on to San Diego, landing roughly five hours later than planned.\n\nA Southwest spokesperson said the airline canceled about 20 flights and diverted some others that later arrived in San Diego.\n\n\"Nothing is more important to Southwest than the safety of our customers and employees,\" they added.\n\nTwo private jets, flying from Colorado ski resorts, didn't have to divert too far — they were the only ones able to land at McClellan-Palomar Airport in northern San Diego County, per Flightradar24.",

    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO, Calif. (FOX5/KUSI) — Heavy rain soaking San Diego on New Year’s Day caused widespread flooding and prompted multiple water rescues across the county, as storm runoff overwhelmed roads and drainage systems and left drivers and pedestrians trapped in fast-moving water.\n\nSome of the most severe flooding was reported in Mission Valley, a low-lying area known for flooding during periods of sustained rain. Water remained pooled in parts of the neighborhood hours after the heaviest rainfall, underscoring how quickly conditions deteriorated.\n\nEmergency crews responded to numerous rescue calls throughout the day, including along Fashion Valley Road, where rising floodwaters stranded motorists. In one incident, firefighters rescued one adult and one child from a Jeep that became partially submerged as water levels rose rapidly.\n\nSan Diego Fire-Rescue officials said another rescue unfolded nearby at Camino de la Reina and Avenida del Rio, where a man became trapped underneath a bridge as floodwaters surged. Search-and-rescue teams deployed a raft to reach him and safely pulled him out before transporting him to a hospital for medical evaluation.\n\n“This is about as bad as I’ve seen it,” said Mission Valley resident Steven Shadpour, who noted that flooding has been a recurring issue in the area. “They told us when I bought the place that Mission Valley is lower elevation, so whenever it rains, it floods down here.”\n\nFire officials emphasized that many of the rescues were preventable and urged the public to avoid flooded roads.\n\nCrews also responded to other storm-related emergencies across the county, including a rescue at Lake Hodges, where a woman was swept by floodwaters and later rescued by helicopter.",

    "description": "The 18-year-old is now second-longest tenured player on San Diego Wave",
    "fullText": "San Diego native Melanie Barcenas has signed a new one-year contract to stay with San Diego Wave FC through the 2026 season.\n\n“Being able to play for San Diego means a lot to me,” said Barcenas. “This city is where I grew up and where I first fell in love with the game. I have learned a lot in my first seasons, and I know there is more I can give. I am excited to get back on the field and keep representing this club and community.”\n\nBarcenas joined the Wave in 2023 at just 15 years old, and was the youngest player ever signed to an NWSL team at 15 years and 138 days at the time. Her record has since been broken by Mak Whitham who signed at just 13 years old with Gotham FC in 2024.\n\nThe 18-year-old forward is an attacking-minded player who can play both on the wings and in the midfield. Barcenas is most famous for strong footwork and technique in the final third that make for exciting highlights, but has not translated to consistent goal-scoring.\n\nBarcenas appeared in the most matches of her professional career in 2025 making 17 appearances before her season was cut short due to a foot injury. The injury forced her to miss the remaining nine matches of the Wave’s season.\n\nThe young player has also spent lots of time with the United States Youth National Team having featured in a different role across various age-groups. Barcenas played every match in the 2024 Under-17 Women’s World Cup earning the United States a third place finish.\n\n“(Barcenas) represents what it means to come through San Diego and compete with pride at the professional level,” said Sporting Director and General Manager Camille Ashton. “Since joining the Club at just 15, she has shown consistent growth in her technical ability, her tactical understanding and approach to the demands of the professional game. We’re proud to keep her in San Diego and look forward to supporting her next phase of development.”\n\nThe Wave have announced multiple roster moves this week including the additions of Mia Van Zanten and Lia Godfrey from the collegiate ranks. The most notable change of the offseason by the Southern California club has been the mutually parting ways with their captain and starting goalkeeper Kailen Sheridan.",

    "fullText": "It wasn’t pretty, but early balance by the San Diego State Aztecs gave way to a finishing flourish led by BJ Davis in an 81-68 win over the San José State Spartans on Tuesday night at the Provident Credit Union Event Center.\n\nA season removed from needing a pair of comebacks, having fallen behind by as much as 21 at Viejas Arena and 17 in Silicon Valley, the Aztecs (8-4, 2-0 Mountain West) led the Spartans (5-8, 0-2)  for the vast majority of the game but it never felt fully comfortable until late.\n\nDavis went into attack mode in the second half, scoring 15 of his 18 points, while Pharaoh Compton came off the bench to score 11 points with an SDSU-high six rebounds. Miles Byrd added 11 points with four steals and Reese Dixon-Waters scored 10 points with a pair of late triples to salt the result.\n\nWearing their alternate scarlet uniforms, the Aztecs defense put the stop sign up in the second half down the stretch. Top scorer Colby Garland knocked down a jumper to make it a 2-point game with 8:52 remaining, but that would be the only SJSU bucket until a layup with 26.8 second left and the game decided.\n\nThe San Diego State closing push came in the final five minutes, as Davis scored 8 of the Aztecs' points in a row and and 10 of 12 points over a three minute stretch where a 63-59 lead ballooned to a 75-62 advantage.\n\nOver the final 13 minutes, San Diego State held the Spartans into 2-of-16 shooting, regularly forcing late shot clock shots from the perimeter and allowing just five offensive rebounds and 7 second chance points in the last 20 minutes. SJSU managed only 17 points from the field and 13 points at the free throw line in the second half.\n\nThe opening 20 saw the teams combine for 23 turnovers, with the Aztecs forcing 13 giveaways by the Spartans — 10 on which came in the first 12 minutes.\n\nA 10-0 run just over four and a half minutes into the game gave SDSU an early lead, but San José State put together a 9-0 run of their own over a 1:11 stretch just past the eight minute mark to stay within shouting distance for the remainder of the half.\n\nBalance was the word of the opening 20 minutes for the Scarlet and Black, as all 11 players had at least one field goal, with Magoon Gwath’s 7 points the most on the squad. That balance was also reflected on the glass, as every player had at least two rebounds, and additionally seven players recorded at least one assist.\n\nGwath was called for a technical foul in the first half, tossing the ball in frustration in the direction of Japhet Moupadele after the Spartan had fouled him to send the SDSU forward to the line for one-and-one. Gwath missed the front end and went to the bench, before playing the final 98 seconds of the first half and then played just six minutes in the second stanza.\n\nOutside of a game-high 30 points from Garland, the Spartans got 13 points from Melvin Bell Jr. and 10 points from Jermaine Washington, but the trio shot 14-of-42 from the field. San Diego State held SJSU to 34.5% shooting, though the hosts were able to stay in the game for much of the second half thanks to making 13-of-15 at the charity stripe.\n\nThis is the final Mountain West meeting between the Aztecs and Spartans, as due to the unbalanced schedule SJSU will not be making the trip to The Mesa this season. San Diego State won 22 of the 23 meetings between the programs in the Mountain West era.\n\nSDSU returns home to host the Boise State Broncos at 7 p.m. on Saturday, January 3 at Viejas Arena. The game will be televised on CBS Sports Network, with radio coverage provided locally on San Diego Sports 760 AM.",
