    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO (FOX 5/KUSI) — Despite rain at the 137th Rose Parade in Pasadena on New Year’s Day, the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance’s creativity and dedication shone through the conditions and received special recognition.\n\nThe nonprofit organization’s “Giant Strides Together” float, which pays homage to the San Diego Zoo Safari Park’s upcoming Elephant Valley exhibit, won the prestigious Grand Marshal Award, given to the most creative concept and float design.\n\nAdorned with intricate designs and featuring a few familiar faces from the Safari Park’s African savanna elephant herd, the design transported parade attendees to the all-new Denny Sanford Elephant Valley, slated to open on March 5 at the Escondido park.\n\n“This year’s float celebrates the majesty of elephants and the immersive experience guests visiting Denny Sanford Elephant Valley will soon get to experience,” said Shawn Dixon, president and chief executive officer, San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance. “We’re excited to receive this honor as we prepare to welcome the world to walk alongside these magnificent animals like never before.”\n\nThe float featured plants and flowers grown at the park’s accredited botanical gardens, which included authentic savanna grasses.\n\nAt the upcoming Elephant Valley, the largest and most transformative project in the Alliance’s 109-year history, guests will be immersed in the savanna, surrounded by elephants on multiple sides, creating the feeling of walking with the majestic herd. The exhibit aims to create greater empathy, understanding and appreciation towards elephants, who are also known as the “architects of the earth.”\n\nThe park’s elephant mother-daughter duo, Umngani and Mkhaya, gained international fame in 2025 when the two, along with other members of the herd, formed a protective “alert circle” during an earthquake.\n\nThe Safari Park in Escondido is home to over 3,100 animals and spans 1,800 acres. Elephant Valley will be included with Safari Park admission.",

    "description": "An equipment outage and flooded roadways led to significant travel disruption at San Diego Airport, affecting over 300 flights.",
    "fullText": "Thousands of people flying into or out of San Diego on New Year's Day had their travel plans disrupted after a rainstorm hit the city.\n\nData from Flightradar24 showed 40 flights headed for San Diego International Airport decided to land elsewhere on January 1.\n\nThere were enough diversions that air traffic control activated a recovery tool to help planes reach their intended destinations.\n\nAnother 53 flights into or out of the airport were canceled, plus nearly 270 were delayed, according to data from FlightAware.\n\nThat meant around 40% of the flights were behind schedule.\n\nA spokesperson for the Federal Aviation Administration told Business Insider it slowed inbound flights \"due to poor visibility and weather conditions,\" and to perform maintenance on an instrument landing system's glide slope.\n\nA glide slope emits a radio signal that helps planes approach a runway from the correct angle and location, which is particularly useful in bad weather or at night.\n\nAn air traffic control advisory also said the disruption was due to an\"equipment outage.\"\n\nIn a post on X, the airport said the weather was causing flight delays, with some nearby roads closed due to flooding. The airport did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside local working hours.\n\nSan Diego is the third-busiest airport in California. It reported handling over 25 million passengers in 2024.\n\nWhile many of the diverted flights eventually made it to San Diego, it was likely a frustrating day for many travellers.\n\nJapan Airlines Flight 66 had flown about 10 hours from Tokyo to San Diego. After circling around the airport, it diverted to Los Angeles, a 30-minute flight away.\n\nJust over two hours later, the Boeing 787 took off again and completed the short flight down to San Diego.\n\nThe airline didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSome Southwest Airlines passengers departing Sacramento had a two-hour flight to nowhere. Flight 3138 spent an hour circling north of Los Angeles before returning to its origin, per flight-tracking data. It later took off again and reached San Diego about five hours behind schedule.\n\nWhile most flights were able to divert elsewhere in California, around a dozen of them diverted to Phoenix.\n\nA Southwest flight from Baltimore spent about an hour circling just west of the Arizona state capital before touching down there.\n\nIt was on the ground for over three hours before continuing on to San Diego, landing roughly five hours later than planned.\n\nA Southwest spokesperson said the airline canceled about 20 flights and diverted some others that later arrived in San Diego.\n\n\"Nothing is more important to Southwest than the safety of our customers and employees,\" they added.\n\nTwo private jets, flying from Colorado ski resorts, didn't have to divert too far — they were the only ones able to land at McClellan-Palomar Airport in northern San Diego County, per Flightradar24.",

    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO, Calif. (FOX5/KUSI) — Heavy rain soaking San Diego on New Year’s Day caused widespread flooding and prompted multiple water rescues across the county, as storm runoff overwhelmed roads and drainage systems and left drivers and pedestrians trapped in fast-moving water.\n\nSome of the most severe flooding was reported in Mission Valley, a low-lying area known for flooding during periods of sustained rain. Water remained pooled in parts of the neighborhood hours after the heaviest rainfall, underscoring how quickly conditions deteriorated.\n\nEmergency crews responded to numerous rescue calls throughout the day, including along Fashion Valley Road, where rising floodwaters stranded motorists. In one incident, firefighters rescued one adult and one child from a Jeep that became partially submerged as water levels rose rapidly.\n\nSan Diego Fire-Rescue officials said another rescue unfolded nearby at Camino de la Reina and Avenida del Rio, where a man became trapped underneath a bridge as floodwaters surged. Search-and-rescue teams deployed a raft to reach him and safely pulled him out before transporting him to a hospital for medical evaluation.\n\n“This is about as bad as I’ve seen it,” said Mission Valley resident Steven Shadpour, who noted that flooding has been a recurring issue in the area. “They told us when I bought the place that Mission Valley is lower elevation, so whenever it rains, it floods down here.”\n\nFire officials emphasized that many of the rescues were preventable and urged the public to avoid flooded roads.\n\nCrews also responded to other storm-related emergencies across the county, including a rescue at Lake Hodges, where a woman was swept by floodwaters and later rescued by helicopter.",

    "description": "The 18-year-old is now second-longest tenured player on San Diego Wave",
    "fullText": "San Diego native Melanie Barcenas has signed a new one-year contract to stay with San Diego Wave FC through the 2026 season.\n\n“Being able to play for San Diego means a lot to me,” said Barcenas. “This city is where I grew up and where I first fell in love with the game. I have learned a lot in my first seasons, and I know there is more I can give. I am excited to get back on the field and keep representing this club and community.”\n\nBarcenas joined the Wave in 2023 at just 15 years old, and was the youngest player ever signed to an NWSL team at 15 years and 138 days at the time. Her record has since been broken by Mak Whitham who signed at just 13 years old with Gotham FC in 2024.\n\nThe 18-year-old forward is an attacking-minded player who can play both on the wings and in the midfield. Barcenas is most famous for strong footwork and technique in the final third that make for exciting highlights, but has not translated to consistent goal-scoring.\n\nBarcenas appeared in the most matches of her professional career in 2025 making 17 appearances before her season was cut short due to a foot injury. The injury forced her to miss the remaining nine matches of the Wave’s season.\n\nThe young player has also spent lots of time with the United States Youth National Team having featured in a different role across various age-groups. Barcenas played every match in the 2024 Under-17 Women’s World Cup earning the United States a third place finish.\n\n“(Barcenas) represents what it means to come through San Diego and compete with pride at the professional level,” said Sporting Director and General Manager Camille Ashton. “Since joining the Club at just 15, she has shown consistent growth in her technical ability, her tactical understanding and approach to the demands of the professional game. We’re proud to keep her in San Diego and look forward to supporting her next phase of development.”\n\nThe Wave have announced multiple roster moves this week including the additions of Mia Van Zanten and Lia Godfrey from the collegiate ranks. The most notable change of the offseason by the Southern California club has been the mutually parting ways with their captain and starting goalkeeper Kailen Sheridan.",

    "fullText": "It wasn’t pretty, but early balance by the San Diego State Aztecs gave way to a finishing flourish led by BJ Davis in an 81-68 win over the San José State Spartans on Tuesday night at the Provident Credit Union Event Center.\n\nA season removed from needing a pair of comebacks, having fallen behind by as much as 21 at Viejas Arena and 17 in Silicon Valley, the Aztecs (8-4, 2-0 Mountain West) led the Spartans (5-8, 0-2)  for the vast majority of the game but it never felt fully comfortable until late.\n\nDavis went into attack mode in the second half, scoring 15 of his 18 points, while Pharaoh Compton came off the bench to score 11 points with an SDSU-high six rebounds. Miles Byrd added 11 points with four steals and Reese Dixon-Waters scored 10 points with a pair of late triples to salt the result.\n\nWearing their alternate scarlet uniforms, the Aztecs defense put the stop sign up in the second half down the stretch. Top scorer Colby Garland knocked down a jumper to make it a 2-point game with 8:52 remaining, but that would be the only SJSU bucket until a layup with 26.8 second left and the game decided.\n\nThe San Diego State closing push came in the final five minutes, as Davis scored 8 of the Aztecs' points in a row and and 10 of 12 points over a three minute stretch where a 63-59 lead ballooned to a 75-62 advantage.\n\nOver the final 13 minutes, San Diego State held the Spartans into 2-of-16 shooting, regularly forcing late shot clock shots from the perimeter and allowing just five offensive rebounds and 7 second chance points in the last 20 minutes. SJSU managed only 17 points from the field and 13 points at the free throw line in the second half.\n\nThe opening 20 saw the teams combine for 23 turnovers, with the Aztecs forcing 13 giveaways by the Spartans — 10 on which came in the first 12 minutes.\n\nA 10-0 run just over four and a half minutes into the game gave SDSU an early lead, but San José State put together a 9-0 run of their own over a 1:11 stretch just past the eight minute mark to stay within shouting distance for the remainder of the half.\n\nBalance was the word of the opening 20 minutes for the Scarlet and Black, as all 11 players had at least one field goal, with Magoon Gwath’s 7 points the most on the squad. That balance was also reflected on the glass, as every player had at least two rebounds, and additionally seven players recorded at least one assist.\n\nGwath was called for a technical foul in the first half, tossing the ball in frustration in the direction of Japhet Moupadele after the Spartan had fouled him to send the SDSU forward to the line for one-and-one. Gwath missed the front end and went to the bench, before playing the final 98 seconds of the first half and then played just six minutes in the second stanza.\n\nOutside of a game-high 30 points from Garland, the Spartans got 13 points from Melvin Bell Jr. and 10 points from Jermaine Washington, but the trio shot 14-of-42 from the field. San Diego State held SJSU to 34.5% shooting, though the hosts were able to stay in the game for much of the second half thanks to making 13-of-15 at the charity stripe.\n\nThis is the final Mountain West meeting between the Aztecs and Spartans, as due to the unbalanced schedule SJSU will not be making the trip to The Mesa this season. San Diego State won 22 of the 23 meetings between the programs in the Mountain West era.\n\nSDSU returns home to host the Boise State Broncos at 7 p.m. on Saturday, January 3 at Viejas Arena. The game will be televised on CBS Sports Network, with radio coverage provided locally on San Diego Sports 760 AM.",
