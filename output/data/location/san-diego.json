It's always been a goal of mine to play in this league.\n\n\"I want to play in the Champions League here at London City and win many trophies.\"\n\nLondon City Lionesses, playing in the Women's Super League for the first time this season, are currently seventh.\n\nHead coach Eder Maestre added: \"I'm so excited with this signing. I really think she is one of the most exciting forwards I have seen. She is a dribbler who can take on players in one-vs-one situations, and she will be very powerful on the wing.\n\n\"Everybody can see how good she is when she plays and I want that warrior-like and winning mentality off the pitch too, to help us reach our goals.\n\n\"She has won six Champions Leagues, so she has the ambitions and the knowhow to win, on and off the pitch.\"",

Bailey Barnhard scored all 6 of her points in overtime, while Martinez got open back-door to give the Aztecs a two-possession lead midway through the extra session.\n\nThe Aztecs came out of halftime hitting almost everything from beyond the arc, as Martinez opened the third quarter by nailing back to back triples. UNLV responded with an 8-0 run that put the hosts back in front, but Panganiban kept the offense rolling by starting SDSU’s biggest scoring run of regulation.\n\nFirst she canned a 3-pointer, then Martinez got free for a driving layup as Alyssa Jackson and Panganiban made back-to-back 3’s as part of an 11-0 run and 17-8 push to start the second half. The lead grew as large as 10 points twice in the fourth quarter on a Martinez driving score and a Panganiban jumper.\n\nBut UNLV, who have won the last four regular season Mountain West titles, put together a 10-0 run over a 1:42 stretch to retake the lead with 41 seconds remaining. Mariah Elohim made two of her three 3-pointers for the game during the stretch, with Lady Rebels leading scorer kicking the run off with her 16th of 18 points of the night on a transition layup.\n\nPanganiban nailed a triple with 41 seconds left to put SDSU back in front by 1, but the Aztecs fouled Jasmyn Lott on a fast break with 18 seconds remaining, but the guard split the pair at the free-throw line. SDSU had a chance to win the game in regulation when Kennedy Lee was fouled on a put back attempt after Nala Williams’ driving attempt missed.\n\nThe win extended the Aztecs streak to 10 in a row, and was the first win in a true road game at UNLV since the 2012-13 season. San Diego State is 5-0 on the road this season and are 15-4 on the road since the beginning of last year.\n\nUp next will have a bye during the midweek round of Mountain West games, returning to action against the San José State Spartans on Saturday, Jan. 24. Tip-off is scheduled for 1 p.m. and the game will be streamed on the Mountain West Network.",

    "fullText": "A former U.S. Navy sailor convicted of selling technical and operating manuals for ships and operating systems to an intelligence officer working for China was sentenced Monday to more than 16 years in prison, prosecutors said.\n\nA federal judge in San Diego sentenced Jinchao Wei, 25, to 200 months. A federal jury convicted Wei in August of six crimes, including espionage. He was paid more than $12,000 for the information he sold, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement.\n\nWei, an engineer for the amphibious assault ship USS Essex, was one of two California-based sailors charged on Aug. 3, 2023, with providing sensitive military information to China. The other, Wenheng Zhao, was sentenced to more than two years in 2024 after he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and one count of receiving a bribe in violation of his official duties.\n\nU.S. officials have for years expressed concern about the espionage threat they say the Chinese government poses, bringing criminal cases in recent years against Beijing intelligence operatives who have stolen sensitive government and commercial information, including through illegal hacking.\n\nWei was recruited via social media in 2022 by an intelligence officer who portrayed himself as a naval enthusiast working for the state-owned China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, prosecutors said.\n\nEvidence presented in court showed Wei told a friend that the person was “extremely suspicious” and that it was “quite obviously” espionage. Wei disregarded the friend's advice to delete the contact and instead moved conversations with the intelligence officer to a different encrypted messaging app Wei believed was more secure, prosecutors said.\n\nOver the course of 18 months, Wei sent the officer photos and videos of the Essex, advised him of the location of various Navy ships and told him about the Essex's defensive weapons, prosecutors said.\n\nWei sold the intelligence officer 60 technical and operating manuals, including those for weapons control, aircraft and deck elevators. The manuals contained export control warnings and detailed the operations of multiple systems aboard the Essex and similar ships.\n\nHe was a petty officer second class, which is a enlisted sailor's rank.\n\nThe Navy's website says the Essex is equipped to transport and support a Marine Corps landing force of over 2,000 troops during an air and amphibious assault.\n\nIn a letter to the judge before sentencing, Wei apologized and said he shouldn’t have shared anything with the person who he had considered a friend. Wei said “introversion and loneliness” clouded his judgment.",

It's a behavior described as mugging.\n\nBut on Saturday off San Diego, a humpback whale seemed more curious about a furry rescue dog named Fin – and vice versa.\n\nThe accompanying footage, captured by Gone Whale Watching San Diego, shows Fin enthusiastically greeting a humpback whale that surfaced just feet from the vessel’s bow.\n\nDominic Biagini, owner of the company, stated via Instagram: “Watching my dog fall in love with whales has been one of the great joys of my life!”\n\nThe heartwarming interaction occurred after Jess Aubry, a Gone Whale Watching San Diego captain, encountered a large pod of humpback whales during a five-hour excursion. Biagini traveled to the location with his partner, Erica Sackrison, and Fin.\n\nSackrison commented via Instagram: “Who’s watching who?”\n\nAubury remarked: “That tail is going a mile a minute.”\n\nOne follower observed that Fin seems to be the boat's only occupant.\n\nFin, a mixed yellow lab/golden retriever, was rescued by Biagini near the U.S.-San Diego border.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Rescue dog greeted by whale in heartwarming encounter off San Diego",

    "fullText": "Today, the North Carolina Courage announced that they have signed CANWNT goalkeeper Kailen Sheridan to a two-year, fully-guaranteed contract through the 2027 season.\n\n“I can’t wait to join the Courage and bring my family to North Carolina. This team’s soccer identity and tactical systems are so exciting and fit the way I like to play as well. I’m really looking forward to joining the team, getting to work on the field, and focusing on a great season this year,” said Sheridan.\n\nWidely considered one of the best goalkeepers in the world, Sheridan has consistently found herself with numerous accolades and awards. She was named to NWSL Best XI First Team in 2021 and 2022, and Second Team in 2023. The GK also took home Goalkeeper of the Year honors in 2022.\n\nIn nine seasons, she earned 42 clean sheets in 166 regular season appearances. With the San Diego Wave, she help guide them to the 2023 NWSL Shield and 2024 NWSL Challenge Cup.\n\n“We’re delighted to welcome Kailen Sheridan to the club. She is an elite goalkeeper with proven experience at the highest level, and her leadership, distribution and shot-stopping ability immediately raise the standard of our squad. Kailen brings a strong mentality and professionalism that will be invaluable both on and off the pitch, and we’re confident she will play a key role in helping us achieve our objectives moving forward,” said Courage Chief Soccer Officer Ceri Bowley.\n\nInternationally, she has 63 appearances for the Canada Women’s National Team. In 2020, with her country, won the 2020 Olympic Gold Medal. She has represented her country at two World Cups and Olympics.\n\nAfter the departure of Casey Murphy, goalkeeper became a priority for NC Courage. And now, the club just brought in one of the very best. North Carolina will be a team to watch in 2026 after narrowly missing the playoffs this past season.",

The exhibit aims to create greater empathy, understanding and appreciation towards elephants, who are also known as the “architects of the earth.”\n\nThe park’s elephant mother-daughter duo, Umngani and Mkhaya, gained international fame in 2025 when the two, along with other members of the herd, formed a protective “alert circle” during an earthquake.\n\nThe Safari Park in Escondido is home to over 3,100 animals and spans 1,800 acres. Elephant Valley will be included with Safari Park admission.",

The airport did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside local working hours.\n\nSan Diego is the third-busiest airport in California. It reported handling over 25 million passengers in 2024.\n\nWhile many of the diverted flights eventually made it to San Diego, it was likely a frustrating day for many travellers.\n\nJapan Airlines Flight 66 had flown about 10 hours from Tokyo to San Diego. After circling around the airport, it diverted to Los Angeles, a 30-minute flight away.\n\nJust over two hours later, the Boeing 787 took off again and completed the short flight down to San Diego.\n\nThe airline didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSome Southwest Airlines passengers departing Sacramento had a two-hour flight to nowhere. Flight 3138 spent an hour circling north of Los Angeles before returning to its origin, per flight-tracking data. It later took off again and reached San Diego about five hours behind schedule.\n\nWhile most flights were able to divert elsewhere in California, around a dozen of them diverted to Phoenix.\n\nA Southwest flight from Baltimore spent about an hour circling just west of the Arizona state capital before touching down there.\n\nIt was on the ground for over three hours before continuing on to San Diego, landing roughly five hours later than planned.\n\nA Southwest spokesperson said the airline canceled about 20 flights and diverted some others that later arrived in San Diego.\n\n\"Nothing is more important to Southwest than the safety of our customers and employees,\" they added.\n\nTwo private jets, flying from Colorado ski resorts, didn't have to divert too far — they were the only ones able to land at McClellan-Palomar Airport in northern San Diego County, per Flightradar24.",

    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO, Calif. (FOX5/KUSI) — Heavy rain soaking San Diego on New Year’s Day caused widespread flooding and prompted multiple water rescues across the county, as storm runoff overwhelmed roads and drainage systems and left drivers and pedestrians trapped in fast-moving water.\n\nSome of the most severe flooding was reported in Mission Valley, a low-lying area known for flooding during periods of sustained rain. Water remained pooled in parts of the neighborhood hours after the heaviest rainfall, underscoring how quickly conditions deteriorated.\n\nEmergency crews responded to numerous rescue calls throughout the day, including along Fashion Valley Road, where rising floodwaters stranded motorists. In one incident, firefighters rescued one adult and one child from a Jeep that became partially submerged as water levels rose rapidly.\n\nSan Diego Fire-Rescue officials said another rescue unfolded nearby at Camino de la Reina and Avenida del Rio, where a man became trapped underneath a bridge as floodwaters surged. Search-and-rescue teams deployed a raft to reach him and safely pulled him out before transporting him to a hospital for medical evaluation.\n\n“This is about as bad as I’ve seen it,” said Mission Valley resident Steven Shadpour, who noted that flooding has been a recurring issue in the area. “They told us when I bought the place that Mission Valley is lower elevation, so whenever it rains, it floods down here.”\n\nFire officials emphasized that many of the rescues were preventable and urged the public to avoid flooded roads.\n\nCrews also responded to other storm-related emergencies across the county, including a rescue at Lake Hodges, where a woman was swept by floodwaters and later rescued by helicopter.",

    "description": "The 18-year-old is now second-longest tenured player on San Diego Wave",
    "fullText": "San Diego native Melanie Barcenas has signed a new one-year contract to stay with San Diego Wave FC through the 2026 season.\n\n“Being able to play for San Diego means a lot to me,” said Barcenas. “This city is where I grew up and where I first fell in love with the game. I have learned a lot in my first seasons, and I know there is more I can give. I am excited to get back on the field and keep representing this club and community.”\n\nBarcenas joined the Wave in 2023 at just 15 years old, and was the youngest player ever signed to an NWSL team at 15 years and 138 days at the time. Her record has since been broken by Mak Whitham who signed at just 13 years old with Gotham FC in 2024.\n\nThe 18-year-old forward is an attacking-minded player who can play both on the wings and in the midfield. Barcenas is most famous for strong footwork and technique in the final third that make for exciting highlights, but has not translated to consistent goal-scoring.\n\nBarcenas appeared in the most matches of her professional career in 2025 making 17 appearances before her season was cut short due to a foot injury. The injury forced her to miss the remaining nine matches of the Wave’s season.\n\nThe young player has also spent lots of time with the United States Youth National Team having featured in a different role across various age-groups. Barcenas played every match in the 2024 Under-17 Women’s World Cup earning the United States a third place finish.\n\n“(Barcenas) represents what it means to come through San Diego and compete with pride at the professional level,” said Sporting Director and General Manager Camille Ashton. “Since joining the Club at just 15, she has shown consistent growth in her technical ability, her tactical understanding and approach to the demands of the professional game. We’re proud to keep her in San Diego and look forward to supporting her next phase of development.”\n\nThe Wave have announced multiple roster moves this week including the additions of Mia Van Zanten and Lia Godfrey from the collegiate ranks. The most notable change of the offseason by the Southern California club has been the mutually parting ways with their captain and starting goalkeeper Kailen Sheridan.",

He picked up three fouls in the first half, including a technical in the final minute, and sat for the first 6 1/2 minutes of the second. Shortly after subbing back in, he committed his fourth foul and headed back to the bench.\n\nTy-Laur Johnson scored 21 points for San Diego (6-8, 1-1), while Juanse Gorosito had 16, Darrae Goodwin 15, Adrian McIntyre 12 and Toneari Lane 10.\n\nNO. 12 NORTH CAROLINA 79, FLORIDA STATE 66\n\nCHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) — Caleb Wilson had 22 points in North Carolina’s win over Florida State.\n\nWilson also had 16 rebounds and six assists for the Tar Heels (13-1, 1-0 Atlantic Coast Conference). Seth Trimble scored 20 points while shooting 6 of 13 from the field and 8 for 11 from the line and added seven rebounds and four steals. Kyan Evans had 15 points and went 5 of 15 from the field (5 for 12 from 3-point range). The Tar Heels picked up their seventh straight win.\n\nThe Seminoles (7-7, 0-1) were led by Chauncey Wiggins, who recorded 16 points and 10 rebounds. Kobe Magee added 12 points for Florida State. Robert McCray finished with 11 points, six rebounds and eight assists.\n\nNO. 13 NEBRASKA 86, NEW HAMPSHIRE 55\n\nLINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — Payton Sandfort scored 19 points and No. Nebraska shook off a second straight slow start to beat New Hampshire and go undefeated in nonconference play for the first time since 1928-29.\n\nThe Cornhuskers (13-0) extended the best start in program history but not before the Wildcats (4-9) of America East, like North Dakota of the Summit League nine days earlier, caused some anxious moments.\n\nThe Huskers led by just three at halftime but were much sharper on both ends after that and will ride momentum into Friday night’s Big Ten home game against ninth-ranked Michigan State.\n\nBraden Frager scored 15 points and Berke Buyuktuncel added 14 for the Huskers. Jack Graham had 15 of his 17 points in the first half to lead New Hampshire.\n\nNO. 16 LOUISVILLE 90, CALIFORNIA 70\n\nNO. 19 TENNESSE 105, SOUTH CAROLINA STATE 54\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn.

    "fullText": "It wasn’t pretty, but early balance by the San Diego State Aztecs gave way to a finishing flourish led by BJ Davis in an 81-68 win over the San José State Spartans on Tuesday night at the Provident Credit Union Event Center.\n\nA season removed from needing a pair of comebacks, having fallen behind by as much as 21 at Viejas Arena and 17 in Silicon Valley, the Aztecs (8-4, 2-0 Mountain West) led the Spartans (5-8, 0-2)  for the vast majority of the game but it never felt fully comfortable until late.\n\nDavis went into attack mode in the second half, scoring 15 of his 18 points, while Pharaoh Compton came off the bench to score 11 points with an SDSU-high six rebounds. Miles Byrd added 11 points with four steals and Reese Dixon-Waters scored 10 points with a pair of late triples to salt the result.\n\nWearing their alternate scarlet uniforms, the Aztecs defense put the stop sign up in the second half down the stretch. Top scorer Colby Garland knocked down a jumper to make it a 2-point game with 8:52 remaining, but that would be the only SJSU bucket until a layup with 26.8 second left and the game decided.\n\nThe San Diego State closing push came in the final five minutes, as Davis scored 8 of the Aztecs' points in a row and and 10 of 12 points over a three minute stretch where a 63-59 lead ballooned to a 75-62 advantage.\n\nOver the final 13 minutes, San Diego State held the Spartans into 2-of-16 shooting, regularly forcing late shot clock shots from the perimeter and allowing just five offensive rebounds and 7 second chance points in the last 20 minutes. SJSU managed only 17 points from the field and 13 points at the free throw line in the second half.\n\nThe opening 20 saw the teams combine for 23 turnovers, with the Aztecs forcing 13 giveaways by the Spartans — 10 on which came in the first 12 minutes.\n\nA 10-0 run just over four and a half minutes into the game gave SDSU an early lead, but San José State put together a 9-0 run of their own over a 1:11 stretch just past the eight minute mark to stay within shouting distance for the remainder of the half.\n\nBalance was the word of the opening 20 minutes for the Scarlet and Black, as all 11 players had at least one field goal, with Magoon Gwath’s 7 points the most on the squad. That balance was also reflected on the glass, as every player had at least two rebounds, and additionally seven players recorded at least one assist.\n\nGwath was called for a technical foul in the first half, tossing the ball in frustration in the direction of Japhet Moupadele after the Spartan had fouled him to send the SDSU forward to the line for one-and-one. Gwath missed the front end and went to the bench, before playing the final 98 seconds of the first half and then played just six minutes in the second stanza.\n\nOutside of a game-high 30 points from Garland, the Spartans got 13 points from Melvin Bell Jr. and 10 points from Jermaine Washington, but the trio shot 14-of-42 from the field. San Diego State held SJSU to 34.5% shooting, though the hosts were able to stay in the game for much of the second half thanks to making 13-of-15 at the charity stripe.\n\nThis is the final Mountain West meeting between the Aztecs and Spartans, as due to the unbalanced schedule SJSU will not be making the trip to The Mesa this season. San Diego State won 22 of the 23 meetings between the programs in the Mountain West era.\n\nSDSU returns home to host the Boise State Broncos at 7 p.m. on Saturday, January 3 at Viejas Arena. The game will be televised on CBS Sports Network, with radio coverage provided locally on San Diego Sports 760 AM.",
