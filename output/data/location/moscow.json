    "description": "Russia said on Thursday that any \"illegal action\" by the European Union in relation to ​its frozen assets would elicit \"the harshest reaction\", and that ‌Moscow was already preparing its response.  The European Commission proposed on Wednesday an ‌unprecedented use of frozen Russian assets or international borrowing to raise 90 billion euros ($105 billion) for Ukraine to cover its struggling military and basic services against Russia's war.  The proposal would invoke emergency ⁠powers in order to ‌circumvent any veto from EU countries that are friendly towards Russia, such as Hungary and Slovakia.",
