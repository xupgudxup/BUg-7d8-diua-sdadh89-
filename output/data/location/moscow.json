    "title": "A Secret Soviet Plan to Nuke America From the South Pole Was Working. Until UFO Hunters Looked Up.",
    "description": "When a glowing crescent appeared over Moscow in 1967, alien enthusiasts panicked—unaware they were tracking a 3-megaton weapon meant to bypass American radar.",
    "fullText": "During the late 1960s, a top-secret Soviet program to sneak nuclear weapons around U.S. early warning radars was mistaken for a rash of UFO sightings by Moscow’s citizens. The weapon, known as FOBS, created a mysterious pattern in the night sky that many mistook for signs of alien visitation.\n\nIn the spring of 1967, people living in the western Soviet Union noticed something odd in the sky at dusk: a mysterious crescent-shaped sliver of light, about the size of the moon from most directions but larger from others. The crescent appeared six times in 1967, always at the same time of day, before it finally disappeared.\n\nAccording to veteran space expert James Oberg at Air & Space Magazine, the Soviet press speculated they were UFOs, and UFO enthusiast groups sprang up across the country to record the sightings.\n\nSuddenly, after the sixth incident, Soviet press coverage of the incidents abruptly stopped. Someone in Moscow with the right clearance realized that the crescents in the sky at sundown were actual evidence of a top-secret weapons test—one that violated existing treaties on the deployment of nuclear weapons into space.\n\nThe “UFO” sightings were actually test launches of the R-36 Orb, a secret nuclear space missile. Developed from the SS-9 Scarp intercontinental ballistic missile, the R-36 Orb was designed to rocket into low-Earth orbit and de-orbit over the United States. Launched in a southern direction, the weapon could pass over the South Pole and then come at the United States from the direction of Mexico, bypassing the network of early warning radars facing north.\n\nThe trip would be longer, but would catch the Americans by surprise, allowing the Soviets the chance to detonate a 2-3 megaton thermonuclear weapon wherever they might choose.\n\nThe R-36 was a so-called “first strike” weapon. The only logical reason to have such a weapon was to use it first in a nuclear war, as a surprise weapon meant to destroy American leadership and nuclear command and control systems. The problem? The R-36 was not accurate.\n\nOn average, half of R-36s launched in a war would land within three miles of their target. That’s not a deal breaker with a 5-megaton warhead, but it does rule out destroying enemy missile silos. Still, the R-36 would retain use when it came to wiping out the White House, Pentagon, U.S. nuclear bombers sitting on the tarmac, and other vital U.S. installations in a surprise attack.\n\nThe Soviet military conducted six tests of the R-36, each at the exact time of day when the missiles were illuminated but the recording cameras were in shadow. The illuminated crescent was caused by the weapon’s braking maneuver, in which the de-orbit engine fired up and spewed exhaust as the weapon turned 180 degrees. This created a clearly visible letter “C” in the early evening sky. This slowed the R-36 down so that it entered low earth orbit, and would be fired back up again later to begin the de-orbiting process.\n\nAlthough the Soviets initially explained away the tests as launches of “scientific research satellites,” American intelligence eventually figured out what they were up to and called the USSR out on it. Within eight months of the first test, according to Oberg, the U.S. claimed the R-36 was a first-strike weapon that used an orbit/de-orbit scheme.\n\nThis would run afoul of the Outer Space Treaty, which was nearing completion and which would ban the placement of nuclear weapons in orbit. It would also run counter to U.N. Resolution 1884, passed in 1963, which called on the U.S. and U.S.S.R. not to place nuclear weapons in space.\n\nThe Soviet Union never came clean about the R-36. Eighteen of the weapons were based in silos near Tyuratam, and later banned by the SALT II arms control treaty. The weapons had long since been obsolete, foiled by the deployment of new, southward-facing American early warning radars and Soviet ballistic missile submarines that could launch an attack from that direction much more quickly. The UFOs, it turned out, were not so unidentified after all.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "The gap between Russia and the West has pushed Moscow to prioritize unconventional capabilities, a top Norwegian military official said.",
    "fullText": "Russia is betting on its submarines and experimental nuclear weapons to make up for the smaller military force that it fields compared to NATO, a top Norwegian military official told Business Insider.\n\nThat \"inherent asymmetry\" between the Russian armed forces and the militaries of the 32-member NATO alliance, which enjoys far greater conventional strength, has pushed Moscow to prioritize more unconventional capabilities, said Vice Adm. Rune Andersen, chief of the Norwegian Joint Headquarters.\n\n\"It's a wide set of challenges that we are up against,\" he said in an interview last week.\n\nRussia, estimated to have over 1.1 million active-duty troops, less than the US alone with 1.3 million troops, is suffering heavy losses in Ukraine that can't easily be replenished. British intelligence said Moscow has suffered 1.2 million casualties in the war. Western estimates say it's barely breaking even on adding new troops to its ranks.\n\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said 65,000 soldiers were killed across December and January, and US assessments put Moscow's recruitment numbers at 30,000-40,000 a month. Rutte has said that these losses aren't sustainable.\n\nRussian equipment losses have been staggering as well. Ukraine has damaged or destroyed dozens of warships, hundreds of aircraft, and thousands of armored vehicles.\n\nWhile Russia falls short of NATO's conventional strength, especially considering its ongoing losses in Ukraine, alliance military leaders still view Moscow as a threat, particularly its asymmetric capabilities. One such area is its submarine force, Andersen said.\n\nRussia has one of the world's largest submarine fleets, with over 60 boats, some of which are capable of launching ballistic and nuclear-tipped missiles.\n\nAndersen said that Russia can't compete with NATO's integrated surface fleet, equipped with advanced warships and aircraft carriers, so the country is prioritizing underwater capabilities as a way to gain an advantage over the West.\n\n\"Submarines are inherently asymmetric. Underwater is the last place on earth where you can hide,\" Andersen said, adding that NATO forces are highly focused on ensuring that they can secure control of the sub-surface domain.\n\nCmdr. Arlo Abrahamson, a spokesperson for NATO's Allied Maritime Command, told Business Insider that Russia regularly deploys submarines to the Arctic and High North.\n\nHe said that NATO closely tracks this activity; 14 member states operate their own submarines, and the alliance is collectively focused on strengthening its anti-submarine capabilities.\n\nHowever, while NATO \"has significant and broad capabilities with submarines,\" Abrahamson stressed that \"we don't underestimate the capabilities of our adversaries.\"\n\nRussia is also developing weapons systems, some of which are tested in the Arctic, as part of its investments in asymmetric warfare. Two experimental munitions that Andersen identified in the interview are a cruise missile and a nuclear torpedo.\n\nRussian officials disclosed in October that Moscow had tested its nuclear-powered 9M730 Burevestnik cruise missile and autonomous Poseidon torpedo, both of which are intended as second-strike capabilities.\n\nRussia said the Burevestnik, which NATO identifies as the SSC-X-9 Skyfall, flew 8,700 miles and traveled in the air for 15 hours, while the Poseidon launched from a submarine using a boost motor and activated its nuclear power unit to propel it forward.\n\nThe weapons are two of six experimental \"super weapons\" that were unveiled in 2018 by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Moscow has touted the missile and torpedo as being unlimited in range and able to bypass defenses.\n\nThe other weapons in the mix include the Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile, the Zircon ship-launched hypersonic cruise missile, the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle, and the Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile. All are able to carry a nuclear warhead.\n\nSome of these weapons have already been used against Ukraine, frequently not living up to the hype. However, their development represents continued investment in Moscow's nuclear capabilities.\n\n\"You could argue, given that Russia is conventionally bogged down in Ukraine and might come out weakened after the war in Ukraine, that the nuclear weapons are relatively more important to Russia as the core element of any big power ambitions they might have,\" Andersen said.",
