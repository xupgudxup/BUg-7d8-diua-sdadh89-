    "fullText": "Recording what has been erased—and making sense of what remains.\n\nThis piece is part of A Day for Gaza, an initiative in which The Nation has turned over its website exclusively to voices from the Gaza Strip. You can find all of the work in the series here.\n\nAquestion has been haunting me for some time now, a question whose answer I hope is not already lost. It is less a neat inquiry than a muffled cry inside each of us, rising over and over against days filled with repeated loss: Who are we?\n\nI refuse to accept that Gaza will come to be defined only by destruction and loss. This is a land shaped by long and layered human experiences across history. A natural byway between Africa and Asia, it has long been a meeting point for people, trade, and culture. Lineages of language and conversation, shared traditions and space, all came together to create from our long history a sense of “we”—a nomenclature for our collective identity.\n\nWhat I seek is a serious attempt to recall this “we” in the midst of a genocide that has never been just a material act of erasing bodies, but a systematic effort to target both spirit and memory. It has stripped places of their soul and their physical appearance, distorted the very image of belonging, and left us, individually and collectively, digging through the ruins of memory for some natural reflection of who we are.\n\nThis digging is arduous work, nails forever scraping against loss. Even so, we keep at it, building back schools, cultural centers, libraries in our minds, each one a witness, a keeper of knowledge. But how can we even attempt an answer when these places have been erased? When death arrives daily, stealing our loved ones, our people? How can we shape our identity amid this constant loss? I share some of them here to share a fragment of Gaza’s larger story, to connect past with present and reconstruct an image of who we were and who we remain.\n\nThe Islamic University, founded in 1978 as Gaza’s first secondary institution, was more than an academic site. Within its halls, generations of students nurtured curiosity, ambition, and resilience against a backdrop of siege. It was a sanctuary where ideas could thrive, debates could flourish, and a collective consciousness could grow despite the isolation imposed on the Strip. Students from diverse fields—science, media, literature, and religious studies—studied and worked here.\n\nThe university became a beacon of higher education in Gaza, ranking first locally and second nationally. Its programs extended beyond knowledge and towars practical empowerment, shaping graduates who could navigate challenges creatively and lead their communities.\n\nOn October 10, 2023, Israeli war planes bombed the university, partially destroying more than 500 classrooms in more than 20 buildings. The war that followed took with it many of the university’s professors and staff. Dr. Sufian Abdul Rahman Tayeh, the university president and a leading researcher in physics and applied mathematics, known for his work in optics and advanced materials, was killed with his family in December 2023. Dr. Khetam Al-Wasifi, a biophysics professor and author of more than 50 research papers in fields such as electromagnetic waves and simulation techniques, was killed with her husband in a similar attack. Their loss is tremendous, a ragged hole in Gaza’s intellectual fabric.\n\nAl-Azhar University represented a distinct and complementary academic option to the Islamic University, both in the nature of its programs and its role within Gaza’s educational landscape. It was often chosen for its wide range of undergraduate and graduate programs, including veterinary medicine, agriculture, humanities, law, media, and education. Where the Islamic University focused largely on pure sciences and theoretical research, Al-Azhar offered a more diverse professional and academic formation. Its classrooms and lecture halls were incubators of ideas that connected Gaza to broader Arab and international intellectual spheres; It was also a more open environment, one that encouraged students to engage with one another in intellectual and cultural debates.\n\nRecognized regionally as a top institution, Al-Azhar fostered a generation of students equipped to confront adversity with creativity and knowledge. Its partial destruction signifies a rupture in the continuity of our intellectual life, as the branch in Gaza City was partially destroyed on the same night the Islamic University was hit, and the second branch in the south of the Strip was completely demolished in November 2023.\n\nAl-Azhar had created an intellectual breach in Israel’s blockade, a way out of the suffocating grip of a siege that had lasted 16 years. With its destruction, a lifeline that connected Gaza to the Arab region and the wider world—through conferences, cultural activities, and shared knowledge—has been severed. Al-Azhar offered an intellectual fissure through the blockade, an essential breach whose closure has not yet been fully mended.\n\nRashad Al-Shawwa Cultural Center\n\nFounded in 1985 as Palestine’s first cultural center, the Rashad Al-Shawa Cultural Center was intended to break Gaza’s cultural isolation. It hosted exhibitions, performances, and educational programs, cultivating artistic expression among all sectors of the Strip. Palestinian and Arab artists performed on its stage, bringing plays, concerts, film screenings, and other events to the people of Gaza. Among its most prominent figures was Leila Shawa, who designed the stained-glass panels in the main hall. Local Gazan artists, such as Maisara Baroud and Raed Issa, were regular exhibitors, central to the site’s cultural blossoming. Even the building was a work of art; designed by architect Saad Mahfel, it was once shortlisted for the Aga Khan Award for Architecture for its integration of art and local identity. At its center was the Diana Tamari Sabagh Library, one of the largest halls in the Strip, where thousands of books cradled knowledge gathered across diverse fields.\n\nThe Rashad Al-Shawwa Cultural Center embodied the city’s spirit of creativity and resilience. Once a place of cultural refuge, the early weeks of the genocide forced it to become a human refuge one as well. Until its destruction in November 2023, it was used as a shelter for displaced people whose homes had been destroyed by the Israeli military.\n\nThe AL-Qattan Center once housed over 111,500 library books and included approximately 25,000 registered members. More than 45,000 children benefited annually from its workshops, while its focus on reading, arts, and writing meant that the center was a central educational and cultural hub, nurturing both children and teachers through a combination of library resources and educational programs. It served as a bridge between generations, instilling knowledge as a discipline and creativity as central to our cultural pride.\n\nDespite severe damage to its infrastructure, the center’s impact remains a testament to Gaza’s ongoing effort to cultivate artistic resilience and learning amid adversity. Its legacy persists through the educators, artists, and children who continue to carry out its mission.\n\nThe Omari Mosque Library was far more than a selection of books. At once a spiritual and intellectual refuge, it housed texts that were centuries old. Before the war, it held nearly 20,000 books and manuscripts, including rare texts dating back to the Mamluk and Ottoman periods, some over 700 years old, covering fields such as Islamic jurisprudence, philosophy, astronomy, medicine, and religious sciences. Among those was the Sharh al-Ghawamidh in the Science of Inheritance, by the scholar Badr al-Din al-Mardini, a seminal thesis on Islamic inheritance law estimated to be around 500 years old.\n\nMost of these manuscripts were unique to the library—no copies existed elsewhere. They were irreplaceable, an archival scaffolding for the city’s history. When Israel bombed the library—not just once but again and again—it obliterated not just a building but centuries of accumulated knowledge. Though a local team from the Department of Endowments and Antiquities has managed to rescue 123 of the 228 ancient manuscripts, heritage restoration officials in Gaza have said that much of the damage is irreparable.\n\nCentral Library at the Islamic University\n\nAs Gaza’s largest library, the Central Library was a cornerstone of intellectual life for students, researchers, and scholars. Its five floors held an expansive collection of academic resources dating back to 1970, along with countless reference works, student theses, and both Arabic and foreign-language books. When Israel bombed the university in October 2023, nearly 240,000 of the library’s books were burned. The university estimates that the continued bombardment destroyed a total of nearly 1 million books. Their destruction is, by that measure, the single greatest intellectual loss in Gaza’s long and turbulent history.\n\nAl-Daraj is the commercial and architectural center of the old city. The neighborhood is a stage, where the city proclaims itself, a place of commerce, movement, and markets, as well as major cultural and religious landmarks like the Al-Sayed Hashim Mosque, where the grandfather of the Prophet Muhammad is believed to be buried. The sanctity of the mosque—and the Old City by extension—is not something that has been imposed. It whispers through its stillness, in the way light bends as it creeps into the neighborhood.\n\nRayan El Amine, Jack Mirkinson, and Lizzy Ratner\n\nBooks & the Arts\n\n /\n\n Namwali Serpell\n\nThe heart of Al-Daraj also contains Qasr al-Basha, the Ottoman-era building later known as “Napoleon’s Castle.” Napoleon Bonaparte is said to have used it as his base during his campaign against the Palestinian city of Acre. Therein lies the story of Gaza itself. A city that has always existed on the world’s map, never a margin, never a quiet passageway.\n\nAl-Zaytoun is less a neighborhood than a trace of time. The neighborhood moves slowly, the weight of centuries visible in the way its residents saunter. Here, the call to prayer stands beside the sound of church bells. History is inextricable from daily life: The Wilaya Mosque, with its stone inscriptions dating back to the eighth century CE, bears witness not just to architecture but to the living continuity of a city so accustomed to threat. Nearby stands St. Porphyrius Church, a testament to Gaza’s often contested pluralism. It is a neighborhood of difference. A site where religious, social, and human memories sustain. In Al-Zaytoun, the stones are not asked about their faith; they are asked only to endure.\n\nIn the absence of all these places that once were, we hold on to their memory, rebuilding them brick by brick. Even so, we who remain also know that memory is not enough. Even now, Gaza continues to bleed. What this means is that the question is not merely, “How do we rebuild?” but “Will we be able to rebuild?” And “What will rebuilding even mean”?\n\nThe media sometimes portrays reconstruction or international aid as a remedy, but even if buildings are rebuilt, who will restore the heritage? Who will restore the archives? Who will restore the intellectual memory, cultivated over generations of professors, students, and scholars? Who will restore years of research, writing, study, and experimentation? Who will bring back the voices that will never be heard again? And who will bring back the dead?\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "fullText": "Today, The Nation is turning over its website exclusively to stories from Gaza and its people. This is why.\n\nGaza has been suspended in a bloody limbo for months. Despite the much-hyped ceasefire between Israel and Hamas—declared on October 10, 2025—peace has not arrived in the Gaza Strip. The bombings have continued, killing at least 509 people; hunger persists; aid trickles in rather than flows; and Israel remains in control of nearly 60 percent of the terrain. Hundreds of thousands of people continue to live in threadbare tents. Meanwhile, US promises of a “technocratic governance” mask a colonial project bestowed on a people with no say.\n\nThe ceasefire has bred apathy among us—and disinterest from a press that was already turning away. According to a recent study by the media watch group FAIR, US media coverage of Gaza has fallen to its lowest three-month average since the genocide began two-and-a-half years ago. The message is clear: There’s nothing to see here.\n\nThe Nation disagrees. We believe the story of Gaza remains as essential as it was on October 9, 2025, and that those who live in its ruins are the best ones to tell it. So today, February 3, we are turning our website over to Gaza and its people in an initiative we are calling “A Day for Gaza.” There will be no work shared that is not about Gaza, and no pieces published that are not written by people who are in or from Gaza.\n\nThe writers who have shared stories with us have done so in conditions that veer toward the impossible. They have written through hunger and grief, while huddling in makeshift shelters, and while listening to the thud of still-falling bombs—and they have done so, as Engy Abdelal writes, because they want “to tell the world that [they] have a future just as… [they] have had a past.” What they have created, in the process, is not only a record of Israel’s ongoing violence but also a testament to what Gaza was—and might yet be.\n\nNation contributing writer Mohammed R. Mhawish opens the series with a piece exposing the hollowness of the ceasefire, asking, “What do you call a ceasefire agreement under which people keep dying?” It’s a question that echoes across many of the articles, including Ali Skaik’s “The Street That Refuses to Die,” which transports readers to the Colorful Block, one of the author’s favorite places in Gaza. There, Skaik introduces us to family members, old acquaintances, and a 33-year-old street philosopher who observes, “The suffering got worse after the ceasefire. The war of rockets ended, and the cold war began.”\n\nDeema Hattab also ventures out in search of what is, and what was, in “A Catalog of Gaza’s Loss,” her loving reconstruction of some of the intellectual and cultural sites that have been destroyed. And in “How to Survive in a House Without Walls,” Rasha Abou Jalal, a PhD student and writer, explains what it’s like to try to rebuild a home out of rubble and determination. In “My Sister’s Death Still Echoes Inside Me,” Asmaa Dwaima grieves the unfathomable loss of her sister, who was “present in everything, leaving traces of herself everywhere.”\n\nThe rest of the pieces (you can find the full collection here) pick up these themes and expand on them. Written by professional journalists as well as academics, poets, parents, and even a dentist, they represent the breadth of literary and political life that has persisted despite the ongoing war in Gaza. They include literary criticism, dreams, and personal testimony.\n\nIn sharing “A Day for Gaza,” we hope to breach the silence that has descended around Gaza, and to do so by offering a microphone to some of the 2 million people whose stories demand to be told. We also want to extend an invitation—and a challenge—to our colleagues across the media industry to recommit to telling the story of Gaza. We owe its people—and the hundreds of our fellow journalists who have given their lives to bring us the truth from Gaza—nothing less.\n\nCollectively, the pieces from “A Day for Gaza” embody an enduring affirmation of Gaza’s refusal, in the face of the world’s neglect, to be erased. We are honored to turn The Nation over to these writers, photographers, and thinkers, to provide a place for them to tell their stories, and we urge other media outlets to do the same.\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "fullText": "What I saw walking one block in Gaza.\n\nThis piece is part of A Day for Gaza, an initiative in which The Nation has turned over its website exclusively to voices from the Gaza Strip. You can find all of the work in the series here.\n\nI used to know this block, the Colorful Block, by the sound of life.\n\nChildren’s laughter spilled from every doorway; men argued playfully over the price of tomatoes; my uncle’s supermarket—bright and packed with goods of every kind—glowed late into the night. The refrigerator hummed, the bulbs buzzed, and the air smelled like oranges and detergent.\n\nThat was before everything went dark.\n\nWhen I came back after the ceasefire, I could barely recognize the street. The neighborhood, once painted in pinks, blues, and yellows to chase away the gloom of the blockade, had turned the color of dust. My uncle’s supermarket was only a blackened frame. Where the candy aisle once stood, a twisted shopping cart now lay half-buried in rubble.\n\nPeople say the war has ended. But walking here, amid roofless rooms and doorways that open onto the sky, you understand: The war has only changed shape. The bombs have mostly stopped falling, but the silence that’s followed is its own kind of violence.\n\nSo I decided to try to breach the quiet, to walk this block—house to house, neighbor to neighbor—and ask people how they are living, what they are rebuilding, and what they are still carrying from the genocide that tried to erase us.\n\nAt the corner, Abdel Rahman Jebril, 33, stood beside what used to be his home, leaning on a stick. His left hand was wrapped in cloth, the fingers stiff.\n\n“The suffering got worse after the ceasefire,” he said quietly. “The war of rockets ended, and the cold war began—a war that burns without weapons.”\n\nHis house was hit again and again until it collapsed completely, taking his dreams with it. Now he lives in a cycle of displacement—moving from one borrowed room to another—dragging his children and what little he could salvage.\n\nHe pointed to a small photograph, edges torn: his son Jude, 6, who wanted to become an engineer, and his daughter Lia, 4, who dreamed of being a doctor. “The genocide took our homes and the futures of our children,” he said.\n\nHe looked down at his injured hand. “Sometimes I dream that I wake up and it’s healed—that the house is still standing, that the children are back in school.” He smiled weakly. “But then I wake up for real.”\n\nA little way down the block, in a half-plastered room, sat Nour al-Huda al-Nabih, 33. Stacked neatly beside her was a pile of books, all for her PhD research.\n\nShe lives alone now with her husband, Arafat. They survived, but their children, Ahmad and Rasha, did not.\n\n“Rasha was 11,” she told me, her voice steady. “She was strong, always looking after her brother. In her little will, she wrote, ‘Please don’t yell at Ahmad.’”\n\nHer eyes softened. “Ahmad was so kind. He used to share his snacks with everyone.”\n\nAfter the ceasefire, the first thing she did was visit their graves. Then she returned to her doctoral studies, researching trauma in Gaza. “When I help children smile,” she said, “I feel my own children smiling somewhere, too.”\n\nShe still finds herself in the market, reaching for the same snacks Ahmad and Rasha used to love. “Sometimes I whisper, ‘If they were here, I’d buy this for them.’”\n\nShe gestured around her unfinished room. “I feel like a queen,” she said, “because I have walls. Many people don’t even have that.”\n\nThen she looked straight at me. “My message to the world: ‘Don’t let my children become numbers. Remember their names. Gaza has always stood for the world; now the world must stand for Gaza.’”\n\nOn the sidewalk sat Mohammad Mansour, 74, wrapped in a wool scarf despite the heat.\n\n“Since the Balfour Declaration in 1917,” he began, “we’ve been living this occupation. They want a land without people. This genocide is their way of finishing the project.”\n\nHe listed what was destroyed: homes, schools, mosques. “They even turned it into a war on faith,” he said.\n\nBefore the war, $30 could fill his pantry. During the genocide, one kilo of onions cost $100. “Now prices go up and down like bombs,” he said.\n\nHe spoke of two people he’ll never forget: young Aref Abu Laban, who was killed while helping his mother pick lemons, and his old friend Mohammad al-Saidi, who had dreamed up the Colorful Block project that once made these walls bright. “He believed color could defeat despair,” Mansour said. “Now the walls are gray again, but the dream is still alive in my heart.”\n\nI met Dunya Ashour, 19, when she was taking some photos of the destruction of the New Ajjami Mosque.\n\n“I don’t feel the ceasefire,” she told me. “At night I still wake up to explosions two kilometers away, in the yellow zones. I can smell the gunpowder in the air.”\n\nShe lost her favorite teacher, Arij al-Maydana, as well as her grandfather, Jameel. “I carry their loss every day,” she said, “but I tell myself they’re in a better place.”\n\nAgainst all odds, she finished her high school exams after two years of delay. “I studied under bombardment,” she said proudly. “I got 92.4 percent.”\n\nHer family is displaced; their house is gone. “We might leave Gaza if the Rafah border opens,” she said. “But I want to come back one day as Dr. Dunya.” She will return, she often says, as the dentist who rebuilt her own smile.\n\nShe looked around the ruins. “The genocide taught me not to grieve over small things,” she said. “Every morning I wake up alive is a victory.”\n\nI talked to Montaser Tarazi, 35, in the Latin monastery church located next to the Colorful Block. Tarazi is a Christian. “After the ceasefire, things became slightly less dangerous,” he said. “I can walk to the market again without fearing I’ll die halfway. But the loss… ” He paused. “The loss walks with us.”\n\nHis best friend, Dr. Suliman Tarazi, a dentist, was killed while taking shelter in the Orthodox Church. “That strike broke something in all of us,” he said. “If even the church can be bombed, nowhere is sacred.” Montaser’s house was destroyed. For three weeks, he and his family cleared rubble by hand. “We rebuild with our fingers,” he explained. But without equipment or cement, they gave up. It was like trying to plant a tree in ashes.\n\nYet he still believes in change. “If a unity government forms, if aid finally enters without limits, maybe Gaza can breathe again,” he said. “After more than 68,000 martyrs, something in us must change forever.”\n\nAt the entrance to the block stood my maternal uncle Hassan Skaik, 29, in front of what used to be his supermarket—the same one where I once worked. “I feel both good and bad,” he told me. “Good, because the blood stopped flowing. Bad, because everything else stopped too.”\n\nHis supermarket is destroyed: the refrigerators crushed, the shelves twisted. “Before, it was full of lights and laughter,” he said. “Now I only hear my own echo.”\n\nHe lost nine friends from the Al Saqqa family in one air strike. “It still feels unreal,” he said softly.\n\nAt night, he dreams of running from fire belts. “Every night,” he said, “the same nightmare.” But he’s learning to be grateful for survival. “We’ve started from zero before,” he said. “We’ll do it again…life, even like this, is a gift.”\n\nAt the far end of the street, Mahmoud Haddad, 38, stood by a cracked water tank, his shirt soaked from work.\n\n“The only thing that changed after the ceasefire,” he said, “is that the bombs are quieter.”\n\nHe and his neighbors cleared debris from a collapsed saltwater well, trying to make it usable again. “The municipality doesn’t work,” he said, “so we do it ourselves.”\n\nThey ration water by the liter. “Drinking water costs $2 for 20 liters, if you find it,” he said. “Sometimes we share one liter for two days.”\n\nHis friend and coworker Diya Hammam was killed in the war. “He made everyone laugh,” Haddad said. “Now the whole street is silent.”\n\nHe believes the only real solution begins with education. “If the schools reopen, Gaza will start breathing again,” he said. “Without education, we’re just surviving.”\n\nKhaled Al Saqqa, 28, is one of the few survivors of his family. His mother and seven siblings were killed.\n\n“I’m the dead one,” he said. “They’re the ones alive.”\n\nEvery morning he visits the rubble of his house. “I touch the walls,” he said. “I talk to them. I tell them I’m still here.”\n\nHe recently married. He is working on setting up a tent over the rubble of his home to live in with his wife, Dareen. “Rebuilding isn’t about cement,” he said. “It’s about learning to live again.”\n\nHe looked at me with tired eyes. “The crisis isn’t in the ruins,” he said. “It’s in my heart. But every breath I take here is for them.”\n\nBeside a torn canvas tent, I found Jamal al-Aklouk, 64, sitting on a plastic chair.\n\n“I retired three years ago,” he said. “Bought my dream home. Thought I’d die in peace there.” The home is gone now; he lives in this tent.\n\nThe destruction of Gaza’s mosques wounded him deeply. “I prayed near the rubble of the Great Omari Mosque,” he said. “Right then, I got a call—my grandson Ahmad was martyred. He was 7.”\n\nHe still carries the pain in his legs from running 17 hours from tanks. “I can’t sleep from the ache,” he said, “but I remind myself—if I can feel it, I’m still alive.”\n\nHe gazed at the sunset. “Everything passes,” he said. “Only faith remains.”\n\nAt the end of the lane stood Saeeh Al Haddad, hammering nails into a wooden frame. He was in Israeli prisons for 19 years and was released in the prisoner exchange deal in January 2025.\n\n“In prison, I lost my freedom,” he said. “But at least there, I was still alive. Out here, freedom feels like rubble.”\n\nHe refused to flee during the war. “When the genocide ended, a new battle began—the fight to adapt.” He lost his brother, Mohammed, his brother’s wife, and his sister’s family. “I carry them with me every day,” he said.\n\nNow he’s rebuilding what he can and planning his wedding. “One day,” he said, “Gaza will be rebuilt more beautifully than before. People will say, “Is this the same Gaza that was turned to dust?”\n\nHe smiled, eyes glistening. “The world needs Gaza,” he said, “to learn how people can build hope from nothing.”\n\nWhen night falls in the Zeitoun neighborhood, the street glows again—not with electricity but with firelight. Families cook lentils on makeshift stoves; children chase shadows with tin cans for toys. The scent of smoke mixes with sea air and memory.\n\nI stop at the ruins of the supermarket. The tiles are cracked, but if I close my eyes, I can still hear my uncle calling, “Cold slash! Come before it’s gone!”\n\nHe was right. Everything is gone.\n\nAnd yet, somehow, everyone is still here.\n\nEach neighbor carries a piece of Gaza’s story—a mosaic of grief, faith, and stubborn hope. They are rebuilding not just homes, but the meaning of life itself.\n\nIn this neighborhood, the war may have paused, but it has not ended.

    "description": "Huda...",
    "fullText": "These pictures are records of a genocidal war, but they are something more, too—they are fragments of Gaza itself\n\nThis piece is part of A Day for Gaza, an initiative in which The Nation has turned over its website exclusively to voices from the Gaza Strip. You can find all of the work in the series here.\n\nIn Gaza, the camera lens does not merely capture a scene. It documents the human spirit resisting death. And for Gaza’s photographers, every shutter click is an act of defiance. Each image carries risk, memory, and moral weight. They photograph through smoke and mourning, through hunger and destruction, and through the ache of watching the people they love become the subjects of their work.\n\nThroughout the Israeli genocide, Gaza’s photographers have become archivists of loss and of life. Their pictures are records of a genocidal war, but they are something more, too—they are fragments of Gaza itself, windows into our collective soul. Through their eyes, we see not only death and devastation, but dignity, defiance, and love that refuses to die.\n\nLate last year, The Nation asked eight photographers from Gaza to choose one picture from the recent past that carried particular significance for them, and to tell us why they’d picked it, when and where it was taken, and what story it tells. This is what they returned with.\n\nSamer Abo Samra, 27, is a freelance photographer. He took this photo on October 29, 2025, at 8:00 am outside the morgue at Gaza’s Al-Shifa Medical Complex following a “massacre that occurred during the Israeli occupation’s breach of the truce that killed about 100 civilians—mostly children and women.”\n\nIn the photo, a grieving father, Mahmoud Shakshak, bids farewell to his children—Sara and Fadi—who were just killed in an Israeli air strike. He was kissing Sara’s foot when Abo Samra took the picture.\n\n“The screams, the disbelief—it was unbearable,” Abo Samra told The Nation. “The father whispered: ‘Last night I bathed you, dressed you in new clothes… Fadi, you wore your Spider-Man shirt… you were so happy. You’ve gone now to a better world. I’ll never see you again.’”\n\n“That scene killed me,” Abo Samra said. “I felt like the camera was crying, and I felt helpless. I’ve captured many powerful images during the genocide—displacement, destruction—but this one broke me.”\n\nFor Abo Samra, the photo is a testament to the “betrayal of a ‘truce’ that was supposed to protect people,” but instead became a cover for a massacre. “It’s a cry from Gaza to the world,” he said. “These children weren’t numbers. They were joy, laughter, and love, stolen from their father’s hands.”\n\nAnas Fteiha, 31, is a photographer for Anadolu Agency. On March 19, 2025, he took this picture of Mohammad Hijazi, a 7-year-old from Jabalia who had fled south with his family during the genocide. While playing outside, Hijazi came across an unexploded remnant of war. It detonated. One of his eyes had to be removed; the other no longer sees.\n\n“When I took his picture, I realized—this child will never see his own reflection again,” Fteiha says. “It was the first time I photographed someone who had lost his sight completely.”\n\nHe remembers his trembling hands as he focused the camera. “He smiled at the sound of the shutter,” Fteiha recalls. “He thought I was taking his picture so he could ‘see it later.’ That broke me.”\n\n“We take sight for granted. For Mohammad, the world is now forever dark and colorless. But his courage is the brightest thing I’ve ever witnessed.”\n\nKhames Al-Refi, 23, is a freelance photographer for Anadolu Agency. On September 16, 2025, he followed Gaza’s civil defense crews to a collapsed house in the Al-Tuffah neighborhood in Gaza City. Beneath the rubble was 10-year-old Mayar Al-Wahidi.\n\nHer father had been killed a week earlier. Her mother had just been martyred in the strike that destroyed the house. But Mayar emerged covered in dust, silent, alive.\n\n“From 2 am until 8 am, they dug,” Al-Refi recalled to The Nation. “When they pulled Mayar out alive, her eyes looked like someone reborn.”\n\n“I’d never crawled under debris before,” Al-Refi said. “At that moment, I wasn’t a journalist—I was part of the rescue.” He stayed with Mayar in the hospital afterward, unable to detach emotionally. “She felt like family,” he said softly. “I still have her number.”\n\nMoatasem Abu Aser, 30, is a documentary filmmaker and photographer. “I chose this photo because behind it lies a vast story—about the violation of women’s rights in Gaza and the layered suffering they endure,” he said.\n\nHe met the woman in this photo by accident on September 11, 2025, near Al-Samer Junction in central Gaza. She had just given birth to twins while living with her mother-in-law and other children on a sidewalk, under a torn tarp, which was attacked by stray dogs at night.\n\n“She asked me to document her story,” Abu Aser told The Nation. “She hadn’t eaten or drunk in days when she was pregnant. One of her newborn twins died of starvation.”\n\nThe image shows her exhausted, eyes hollow, holding her surviving baby.\n\n“When I saw her, I felt powerless,” Abu Aser said. “I couldn’t offer food or shelter. I could only capture her truth. She is like our mothers, our sisters. Her suffering speaks for every woman who bears the cost of genocide and survival.”\n\nMohammed Al-Aswad, 28, is a freelance photographer. “I chose this image,” he said, “because it captures the essence of life clinging to existence amid devastation during the genocide.”\n\nThe photo was taken in November 2023 in the Beit Lahia area, moments after a heavy bombardment. It shows an ambulance racing toward Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Jabalia.\n\n“The air was thick with dust and fear,” Al-Aswad recalled. “The drones were still buzzing above, and the roads were choked with debris. Every step felt like a gamble with death—but I knew I had to capture that moment. It was the battle between annihilation and survival.”\n\nLooking through his lens, Al-Aswad saw more than chaos; he saw defiance. “The ambulance cutting through destruction—it was life fighting to exist,” he said. “That image is my reminder that even under the weight of genocide, humanity refuses to die.”\n\nSuhail Nassar, 30, took this picture, which he called “The Great Return to Gaza,” on January 27, 2025, days after the first extended ceasefire with Israel had been declared.\n\n“It wasn’t just a photograph,” he told The Nation. “It was a statement. A collective heartbeat returning home.”\n\nNassar had returned to his destroyed house in Gaza City with his brother. Around them, survivors embraced and cried amid shattered concrete and silent streets.\n\n“It was the strangest joy,” he said. “We weren’t afraid. We felt as if our souls had finally reunited with the land. Every breath was nostalgia—every ruin, a memory.”\n\nThough Nassar said returning to his home “was the best feeling of my life,” the day was still marked by sadness. “When I stood there, I could almost hear the voices of friends we’d lost. The happiness was pierced by their absence. The city was still wounded.”\n\nOmar El-Qattaa, 35, is a photographer for Agence France-Presse. He took this picture on April 23, 2024, in the Al-Mokhabarat Towers area in Northern Gaza, at the peak of the Israeli-induced famine. It captures a swarm of desperate civilians chasing food dropped from the sky.\n\n“It was a picture of humiliation,” El-Qattaa said. “People fighting over bags thrown from airplanes—like crumbs for birds…there was no aid, no food, nothing but air-drops. I watched people run, fall, hit each other—just to feed their children.”\n\nEl-Qattaa was not simply an uninterested observer. “I was starving too, unable to secure food for my children,” he recalled. “That day, someone shared biscuits with me for them.”\n\nOmar Ashtawy, 21, is a photographer for APAimages and a freelancer with Reuters, UPI, and the DPA Picture Alliance. He took this photo on May 14, 2025, in Jabalia. It shows a crowd with outstretched hands, metal bowls gleaming in the dust.\n\n“I chose this photo because it captures human pain in its rawest form,” he said. “It was not just people holding empty pots and hungry—it was about dignity.”\n\nDust filled the air; people ran with bowls, lids, or anything that could hold a portion of food. Ashtawy stood among them, the camera feeling unbearably heavy. “I was weak, dizzy from hunger like everyone else,” he said. “The cries of children echoed in my head. Each shot felt like betrayal—I was recording pain I shared.”\n\nAshtawy felt the weight of the camera as “a tool carrying a responsibility greater than my ability.”\n\n“I felt anger,” he said. “Anger at a world that lets people beg for life. But I also felt a duty to show the truth before it disappears.”\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "fullText": "At least 28 Palestinians, including six children and several police officers, have been killed in the Gaza Strip since dawn, a day before the Rafah crossing is due to reopen.\n\nAn Israeli air strike on Saturday on a tent sheltering displaced people in the Mawasi area to the northwest of Khan Younis city killed at least seven Palestinians, including three children, medical sources told Al Jazeera.\n\nTheir bodies were taken to the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis.\n\nIn Gaza City, emergency services reported that at least five Palestinians, including three children, were killed in an Israeli air strike on an apartment building in the Remal neighbourhood to the west of the city.\n\n“We could feel the shockwaves of the explosions followed by a huge, dark, dusty cloud that filled the area, leaving at least five people killed inside the residential flat, including a mother and children,” Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud reported from Gaza City.\n\nEight Palestinians were also injured in an Israeli bombing of an apartment building in the Daraj neighbourhood of Gaza City.\n\n“All of this is happening inside the yellow line,” Mamhoud said, adding that in Khan Younis, a building “had been hit by fighter jets and destroyed completely after it was pre-warned by the Israeli military”.\n\nGaza’s Government Media Office says at least 524 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since a United States-brokered ceasefire in Gaza came into effect on October 10.\n\nResidents in the border town of Rafah also reported several air attacks in areas under Israeli control. Israel is due to reopen the Rafah crossing, which links Gaza with Egypt, on Sunday for the first time since May 2024.\n\nThe opening of the key entry point is part of the ceasefire agreement with Hamas. It was meant to open during the first phase of the ceasefire, but Israel refused to do so until the body of its last remaining captive was found.\n\nIsrael on Saturday said it would only allow a “limited movement of people” who have received security clearance by Israel to enter and exit. No aid or humanitarian supplies will be allowed to enter.\n\n“Only those who fled during the past two years are allowed to come back,” Mahmoud explained. “Those who are born outside the Gaza Strip are not going to be allowed to come back.”\n\nHamas responded to the Rafah announcement by calling for Israel to allow movement in and out of Gaza “without restrictions”, and urged it to adhere to all aspects of the ceasefire agreement.\n\nIsrael’s genocidal war on Gaza has killed more than 71,600 Palestinians since October 7, 2023.",

    "fullText": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — President Donald Trump’s latest attempt to sidestep the United Nations through his new Board of Peace appears to have inadvertently backfired after major world powers rejected U.S. aspirations for it to have a larger international mandate beyond the Gaza ceasefire and recommitted their support for the over 80-year-old global institution.\n\nThe board to be chaired by Trump was originally envisioned as a small group of world leaders overseeing his plan for Gaza's future. But the Republican president’s ambitions have expanded to envisioning the board as a mediator of worldwide conflicts, a not very subtle attempt to eclipse the Security Council, which is charged with ensuring international peace and security.\n\nThe board's charter also caused some dismay by stating Trump will lead it until he resigns, with veto power over its actions and membership.\n\nHis secretary of state, Marco Rubio, tried to ease concerns by saying the board's focus right now is only on the next phases of the Gaza ceasefire plan.\n\n“This is not a replacement for the U.N., but the U.N. has served very little purpose in the case of Gaza other than the food assistance,” Rubio said at a congressional hearing Wednesday.\n\nBut Trump's promotion of a broadened mandate and his floating of an idea that the Board of Peace “might” replace the U.N. have put off major players and been dismissed by U.N. officials.\n\n“In my opinion, the basic responsibility for international peace and security lies with U.N., lies with the Security Council,” Secretary General Antonio Guterres said Thursday. “Only the Security Council can adopt decisions binding on all, and no other body or other coalition can legally be required to have all member states to comply with decisions on peace and security.”\n\nIn Security Council statements, public speeches and behind closed doors, U.S. allies and adversaries have dismissed Trump’s latest plan to overturn the post-World War II international order with what he describes as a “bold new approach to resolving global conflict.”\n\n“The U.S. rollout of the much broader Board of Peace charter turned the whole exercise into a liability,” according to the International Crisis Group’s Richard Gowan, a U.N. watcher and program director. “Countries that wanted to sign on to help Gaza saw the board turning into a Trump fan club. That was not appealing.”\n\n“If Trump had kept the focus of the board solely on Gaza, more states, including some more Europeans, would have signed up,” he said.\n\nKey Security Council members haven't signed on\n\nThe four other veto-wielding members of the Security Council — China, France, Russia and the United Kingdom — have refused or have not indicated whether they would join Trump's board, as have economic powers such as Japan and Germany.\n\nLetters sent this month inviting various world leaders to be “founding members” of the Board of Peace coincided with Trump’s vow to take over Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, and punish some European countries that resisted. That was met with stark rebuttal from Canada, Denmark and others, who said Trump’s demand threatened to upend an alliance that has been among the West's most unshakeable.\n\nShortly after, Trump pulled a dramatic reversal on Greenland, saying he had agreed with the NATO secretary-general on a “framework of a future deal” on Arctic security.\n\nAmid the diplomatic chaos, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who at the time had not responded to Trump’s Board of Peace invitation, met with Guterres in London and reiterated “the UK’s enduring support for the UN and the international rules-based system,” according to a statement.\n\nStarmer emphasized the U.N.’s “pivotal role in tackling global problems which shape lives in the UK and all over the world.” The United Kingdom later declined to join the board.\n\nFrance, Spain and Slovenia declined Trump’s offer by mentioning its overlapping and potentially conflicting agenda with the U.N.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said last week that the board goes beyond “the framework of Gaza and raises serious questions, in particular with respect to the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question.”\n\nSpain would not join because the board excluded the Palestinian Authority and because the body was “outside the framework of the United Nations,” Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said.\n\nSome countries are urging a stronger UN\n\nAmerica’s adversaries also have shunned the board.\n\n“No single country should dictate terms based on its power, and a winner-takes-all approach is unacceptable,” China’s U.N. ambassador, Fu Cong, said at a Security Council meeting Monday.\n\nHe called for the United Nations to be strengthened, not weakened, and said the Security Council’s status and role “are irreplaceable.”\n\nIn a clear reference to the Board of Peace, Fu said, “We shall not cherry-pick our commitments to the organization, nor shall we bypass the U.N. and create alternative mechanisms.”\n\nSo far, about 26 of some 60 invited countries have joined the board, and about nine European countries have declined. India did not attend Trump’s signing ceremony at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, last week but is reportedly still deciding what to do. Trump revoked Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s invitation.\n\n“It’s hardly surprising that very few governments want to join Trump’s wannabe-U.N., which so far looks more like a pay-to-play club of human rights abusers and war crimes suspects than a serious international organization,” said Louis Charbonneau, U.N. director for Human Rights Watch. “Instead of handing Trump $1 billion checks to join his Board of Peace, governments should work on strengthening the U.N.”\n\nEight Muslim nations that agreed to join the board issued a joint statement that supported its mission in Gaza and advancement of Palestinian statehood. Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates made no mention of Trump’s global peacemaking plan.\n\nThe Crisis Group’s Gowan said their focus could be a way to “get a foothold in discussions of Gaza” at the start, as Trump’s ceasefire plan has already faced several setbacks.\n\n“I remain unconvinced that this is a real long-term threat to the U.N.,” Gowan said.",

    "fullText": "The Trump administration’s plan for a New Gaza has nothing to do with peace and rebuilding, and everything to do with erasure.\n\nFor those of us who have mourned the loss of countless loved ones killed by the Israeli military over the past 27 months and watched our family homes reduced to rubble, the “New Gaza” vision unveiled by President Donald Trump and Jared Kushner in Davos is an outrageous moral affront. To see AI-generated renderings of luxury high-rises and “coastal tourism zones” atop the literal ruins of our lives is not a vision of peace. It is a blueprint for erasure.\n\nThe plan presented by Kushner—who has deep family ties to Benjamin Netanyahu and a history of funding illegal Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian land in the West Bank—imagines a “New Gaza.” This Gaza is portrayed as a futuristic dreamscape of gleaming apartment blocks, data centers, and luxury towers lining the Mediterranean shore in place of the cities and towns Israel has systematically destroyed—and in fact continues to destroy despite the supposed ceasefire. During his presentation, Kushner praised the value of Gaza’s “waterfront property,” and spoke of planning for “catastrophic success,” effectively recasting mass killing and genocide into an investment opportunity.\n\nThis plan will not achieve peace. It is designed to perpetuate and further entrench a system of Israeli apartheid that has oppressed Palestinians for eight decades, which is the root cause of all the violence between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nEven in a best-case scenario, this plan will likely make Gaza unaffordable for most Palestinians and separate them into “technocratic” camps under the oversight of an “Executive Board” of foreign CEOs run by Trump. Of even greater concern, by prioritizing “industrial zones” and “tech-driven governance” while ignoring Palestinian human rights and Israel’s ongoing campaign to make Gaza unlivable—such that Palestinians have no choice but to leave—this vision amounts to soft ethnic cleansing. Indeed, just a day before revealing this plan, news reports revealed that the Israeli government had been discussing a proposal to reopen the Rafah crossing only on the condition that outbound traffic is prioritized over entry, setting a ratio to ensure that more Palestinians leave the Strip than are allowed to return. This plan is designed to replace our indigenous people and society with a capitalist dystopia where we are merely a cheap labor force behind militarized walls.\n\nTrump and Kushner speak of a “New Gaza” without ever reckoning with Israel’s destruction of the old one. Under this administration’s direction, Gaza is being treated as a distressed asset or a failed start-up awaiting new management, rather than a homeland and the site of a crime scene, with thousands of bodies still missing underneath the rubble.\n\nI owned a home on Gaza’s beach. Israel flattened it last year, as it did tens of thousands of others, damaging or destroying more than 90 percent of all homes in Gaza. No Trump-backed panel of CEOs, autocrats, and leaders of governments complicit in Israel’s genocidal campaign can restore what was stolen by force. Yet, from a conference stage in Davos, they claim the authority to decide what comes next for a people they refuse to even look in the eye.\n\nIf the United States and the international community are serious about moving toward a true and lasting peace, they must abandon these neocolonial plans and pivot toward a solution rooted in freedom, justice, and Palestinian agency.\n\nFor starters, the process must be rooted in Palestinian self-determination; the governance of Gaza must be led by Palestinians, for Palestinians, under a unified national framework—not a “management contract” overseen by foreign trustees. Second, instead of attempting to replace the United Nations system with “free-market principles,” the United States must fully restore funding to UNRWA, ensure unobstructed aid through all crossings, and compel Israel to reverse its ongoing attempts to ban UNRWA and other aid groups from carrying out their critical work. Third, there must be absolute accountability for reconstruction: It must be treated as a legal right and a remedy for the destruction leveled by Israel with US-made weapons, not an ATM for well-connected investors. Finally, there must be a firm political horizon for when the international community recognizes a sovereign, viable Palestinian state within the 1967 borders. Without a clear path to ending Israel’s brutal occupation, any “investment” is simply a way to fund a more comfortable cage.\n\nBut before any of this can happen, Israel must be compelled to finally end its campaign of genocide in Gaza, which, as noted by Amnesty International and others, is ongoing despite the supposed ceasefire announced in October. To achieve this, the international community must move beyond rhetoric and fulfill its legal obligations under the Genocide Convention to prevent further atrocities. This requires the immediate imposition of a comprehensive arms embargo and targeted sanctions on Israel—measures that are not merely political choices but legal imperatives for every signatory committed to halting the destruction of a people.\n\nWhile Israel’s government was consulted in the drafting of Trump’s plan, the Palestinian people—the very subjects of these grand designs—have been deliberately shut out. Decisions about our land, governance, and lives are being finalized in a perversely named “Board of Peace” run by Trump.\n\nTrue peace and rebuilding acknowledge responsibility for the destruction of our homes and lives, and prioritize Palestinian agency. We do not need a “Master Plan” imposed on us by people who do not have our rights or well-being at heart. We need our homeland preserved and rebuilt, and our rights and aspirations centered.",

    "fullText": "JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli forces on Tuesday targeted at least two United Nations facilities, pushing forward with a crackdown against the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees tasked with delivering humanitarian services to millions of people across the region.\n\nCrews began bulldozing the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ’s offices in Sheikh Jarrah and fired tear gas at a vocational school in Qalandia, marking Israel’s latest and most dramatic step against UNRWA.\n\nIsrael has long railed against the agency, accusing it of being infiltrated by Hamas and saying that some of its employees were involved in the October 2023 attack that triggered Israel’s two-year war in Gaza. UNRWA leaders have said they took swift action against the employees accused of taking part in the attack, and have denied allegations that the agency tolerates or collaborates with Hamas.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday condemned Israel’s destruction of the agency's compound and called for it to be returned to the U.N.'s control.\n\n“The Secretary-General views as wholly unacceptable the continued escalatory actions against UNRWA, which are inconsistent with Israel’s clear obligations under international law,\" said Farhan Haq, the deputy U.N. spokesperson.\n\nRoland Friedrich, the agency's West Bank director, said UNRWA received word that demolition crews and police arrived at their east Jerusalem headquarters early on Tuesday. Staff have not operated out of the facility for almost a year out of safety concerns, but Israeli forces confiscated devices and forced out private security guards protecting the facility.\n\n“What we saw today is the culmination of two years of incitement and measures against UNRWA in east Jerusalem,” Friedrich said.\n\nHe said forces also began firing tear gas outside the vocational school on the outskirts of Jerusalem on Tuesday afternoon before ultimately leaving. More than 300 young refugees receive job training in technology and welding there.\n\nSome children on their way home from the school were overcome by the tear gas and a 15-year-old was hit in the eye with a rubber bullet, according to the Palestinian Authority’s Jerusalem governorate, which monitors Palestinian affairs in the area.\n\nIsraeli leaders celebrate demolition\n\nIsrael’s Foreign Ministry said the demolition enforced a new law banning UNRWA, noting that Israel owns the site and rejecting UNRWA’s claims that the move violated international law.\n\nIsrael has long claimed the agency has an anti-Israel bias. Often with little evidence, it says UNRWA employs and maintains ties with militant groups including Hamas. The U.N. has ardently denied such claims and UNRWA has said it acts quickly to purge any suspected militants among its staff.\n\nUNRWA's mandate is to provide aid and services to some 2.5 million Palestinian refugees in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem, as well as 3 million more refugees in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. The group has for years maintained infrastructure in refugee camps and also run schools and provided health care. But its operations were curtailed last year when Israel’s Knesset passed legislation severing ties and banning it from functioning in what it defines as Israel — including east Jerusalem.\n\nThe agency said the demolitions could imperil operations at the vocational center in Qalandia and heath facility in Shu'afat, where it still provides education and health services.\n\nAn Israeli flag was seen hoisted above the facility in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, where some Israeli politicians arrived on the scene to celebrate the organization's fate. National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir called it “a historic day.”\n\nThe demolition marked the culmination of years of criticism from Israel and its leaders. Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war more than two years ago, it has ramped up such attacks, saying the militants used UNRWA facilities and seized aid. It has provided little evidence for the claims, which the U.N. has denied. The International Court of Justice said in October that Israel must allow the agency to provide humanitarian assistance in Gaza.\n\nSince Israel passed its law banning the agency last year, its facilities — schools and health centers — and its headquarters have repeatedly been closed, raided or left unprotected.\n\n“This must be a wake-up call,\" Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA's commissioner-general, said in a statement on X. “What happens today to UNRWA will happen tomorrow to any other international organisation or diplomatic mission, whether in the Occupied Palestinian Territory or anywhere around the world.”\n\nMore aid groups in Gaza face pressure\n\nIsrael's ban on UNRWA dovetailed with broader efforts to deregister aid groups operating in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Israel has passed laws requiring nongovernmental organizations not to hire staff involved in activities that “delegitimize Israel” or support boycotts, demanding they register lists of names as a condition of being allowed to work.\n\nIsrael told dozens of groups — including Doctors Without Borders and CARE — that their licenses would expire at the end of 2025. The organizations say the rules are arbitrary and warned that the new ban would harm people desperately in need of humanitarian aid.\n\nSettler violence in the West Bank rose last year\n\nThe Israeli military said Tuesday that attacks carried out by Jewish settlers against Palestinians and Israeli security forces in the West Bank increased by 27% last year compared with 2024.\n\nThere were 867 reports of “nationalistic crimes” — with the number of severe incidents up by more than 50%, according to internal statistics from the Israeli military and the country’s Shin Bet domestic security service.\n\nMounting settler violence in the West Bank has emptied villages since the war between Israel and Hamas erupted, according to B’Tselem, an Israeli rights group helping the residents.\n\nThe Israeli military has carried out large-scale operations in the West Bank targeting militants that have killed hundreds of Palestinians. There also has been a rise in Palestinian attacks on Israelis.\n\nIsraeli authorities have a mixed relationship with settlers, at times dismantling unauthorized outposts while also deploying forces to protect them from Palestinians.\n\nJulia Frankel and Shlomo Mor in Jerusalem and Edith M.

    "fullText": "The siege of Gaza, as part of the Wars of Alexander the Great, took place in October of 332 BC. Resulting in a victory for Macedon, it ended the 31st Dynasty of Egypt, which functioned as a satrapy under the Achaemenid Persian Empire.\n\nAlexander succeeded in breaching the walls of Gaza by utilizing the engines that he had employed earlier that year, during the siege of Tyre brought by Hephaestion.[3] Following three unsuccessful assaults, the Macedonian army was able to storm and take the Gazan stronghold.[4]\n\nBatis, the military commander of Gaza's fortress,[5] expected to hold the city as well as the rest of Egypt in complete subjection until the raising of another army by Persian king Darius III; confronting Alexander at Gaza was crucial to denying the Macedonians a route into the Egyptian mainland.[6] The fortress was located on an eminence, on the edge of a desert from which the surrounding area could be easily controlled, including the main road from Assyria to Egypt. The city, over 18 metres (60 ft) high, was traditionally employed to control the surrounding area, which, even then, was a hotbed of dissent.[6] Batis was aware that Alexander was leading his army southward after successfully conquering Tyre, and therefore provisioned Gaza for a long siege by the Macedonian army.[6] It is also likely that he was aware of Alexander's intention to secure absolute control over the Mediterranean coast before mounting an invasion of the Persian mainland.\n\nUpon arriving, Alexander camped near the southern side of the city and deemed the southern walls as the weakest.[7] It is alleged that the mounds were built quickly, despite the engineers' belief they could not be completed due to the nature of Gaza's fortifications.[8]\n\nOne day during the siege, the Gazans made a sortie against enemy siege equipment constructed on site, and Alexander led his shield bearing guards into counterattack.[3] Alexander's shoulder was injured in the attempt.[8] According to Arrian, the rest of the mound was completed shortly after, around the whole of Gaza.[8] At some undefined period after this, the siege equipment from Tyre arrived, and was put into use also. It was after this that major sections of the wall were broken by the Macedonians.[8] After three attempts to enter the city, the Macedonians finally entered the city. The Gazans fought bitterly; at one point, an Arab mercenary pretended to surrender and after being taken to the Macedonian camp, attacked Alexander who suffered a minor injury before the Arab was struck down.[1]\n\nBatis refused to surrender to Alexander.[9] When Gaza was taken, the male population was put to the sword and the women and children were sold into slavery.[10] In the battle, there were 10,000 Gazaean casualties.[11]\n\nAccording to the Roman historian Quintus Curtius Rufus,[12] Batis was killed by Alexander in imitation of Achilles' treatment of the fallen Hector:[13] A rope was forced through Batis's ankles, probably between the ankle bone and the Achilles tendon, and Batis was dragged alive by chariot beneath the walls of the city until he died.[12] Alexander, who admired courage in his enemies and might have been inclined to show mercy to the brave Persian general, was infuriated at Batis's refusal to kneel and by the enemy commander's haughty silence and contemptuous manner.[14][15]\n\nAs a result of the siege, Alexander was allowed to proceed south into Egypt securely, without his line of communications being threatened from the North by Batis from Gaza.",

    "fullText": "CAIRO (AP) — A dividing line, at times invisible, can mean life or death for Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nThose sheltering near the territory's “yellow line” that the Israeli military withdrew to as part of the October ceasefire say they live in fear as Israeli soldiers direct near-daily fire at anyone who crosses or even lingers near it.\n\nOf the 447 Palestinians killed between the ceasefire taking effect and Tuesday, at least 77 were killed by Israeli gunfire near the line, including 62 who crossed it, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Among them were teenagers and young children, The Associated Press found.\n\nAnd although the military has placed some yellow barrels and concrete barriers delineating the limits of the Palestinian zone, the line is still unmarked in certain places and in others was laid nearly half a kilometer (0.3 miles) deeper than what was agreed to in the ceasefire deal, expanding the part of Gaza that Israel controls, according to Palestinians and mapping experts.\n\n“We stay away from the barrels. No one dares to get close” said Gaza City resident Ahmed Abu Jahal, noting that the markers are less than 100 meters (110 yards) from his house — instead of the roughly 500 meters (546 yards) outlined in a map put out by the Israeli military.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the military had acknowledged killing 57 people around the yellow line, saying most were militants. It said its troops are complying with the rules of engagement in order to counter militant groups, and are informing Palestinians of the line’s location and marking it on the ground to “reduce friction and prevent misunderstandings.”\n\nUnder the ceasefire, Israel withdrew its troops to a buffer zone that is up to 7 kilometers (4 miles) deep and includes most of Gaza's arable land, its elevated points and all of its border crossings. That hems more than 2 million Palestinians into a strip along the coastline and central Gaza.\n\nPeople of all ages, some already dead, have been showing up almost daily at the emergency room of Gaza City's Al-Ahli hospital with bullet wounds from straying near the line, said hospital director Fadel Naeem.\n\nAmid the vast destruction in Gaza, the demarcation line often isn't easy to detect, Naeem said. He recounted picking his way through undamaged paths during a recent visit to the southern city of Khan Younis. He didn't notice he was almost across the line until locals shouted at him to turn back, he said.\n\nThe Israeli military said most of the people it has killed crossing the line posed a threat to its troops. According to a military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military rules, troops issue audible warnings and then fire warning shots whenever someone crosses the line. Many civilians retreat when warning shots are fired, though some have been killed, the official acknowledged.\n\nKilled while playing near the line\n\nZaher Shamia, 17, lived with his grandfather in a tent 300 meters (330 yards) from the line in northern Gaza’s Jabaliya refugee camp. On Dec. 10, he was playing with his cousin and some friends near the line, according to video he took before his death.\n\nSuddenly, shots rang out and the video stopped. Soldiers approaching the line with an armored bulldozer had fired on the teens, hitting Zaher, said a witness.\n\nA neighbor eventually found Zaher’s body, which had been crushed by the bulldozer, said Zaher's grandfather, Kamal al-Beih: “We only recognized him from his head.\"\n\nTwo doctors, Mohamed Abu Selmiya and Rami Mhanna, confirmed that the teen had been killed by gunshots and then run over by a bulldozer. The military official said he was aware that Shamia was a civilian and that the military was looking into it.\n\nMaram Atta said that on Dec. 7, her 3-year-old daughter, Ahed al-Bayouk, was playing with siblings outside of their tent, which was near the yellow line along Gaza's southern coast. Atta was preparing lentils when she heard aircraft overhead, then shots.\n\nA stray projectile whizzed close to her and struck Ahed, who was dead before they reached the clinic.\n\n“I lost my daughter to what they keep calling a ‘ceasefire’” said Atta, crying. “What ceasefire are they talking about?”\n\nA military official denied the killing.\n\nThe line's exact location is ambiguous, differing on maps put out by the Israeli military and the White House.\n\nNeither matches the line troops appear to be marking on the ground, according to Palestinians and geolocation specialists.\n\nChris Osiek, an open source intelligence analyst and consultant, has geolocated a number of yellow blocks based on social media videos. He found at least four urban areas where troops set the blocks several hundred meters deeper into Gaza than the military map-specified yellow line.\n\n“This is basically what you get when you simply let Trump make an image and post it on Truth Social and let the IDF make their own,” he said, using the acronym for the military. “If it’s not a proper system, with coordinates that make it easy for people to navigate where it is, then you leave the ambiguity free for the IDF to interpret the yellow line how they basically want.”\n\nThe military official dismissed such criticism, saying any deviations from the map amount to just a few meters. But to Palestinians hemmed in by widespread destruction and displacement, every few meters lost is another house that can't be sheltered in — another they doubt will ever be returned.\n\n‘The line is getting very close’\n\nUnder the ceasefire, Israeli forces are only supposed to remain at the yellow line until a fuller withdrawal, though the agreement doesn't give a timeline for that. With the next steps in the deal lagging and troops digging into positions on the Israeli side, though, Palestinians wonder if they are witnessing a permanent land takeover.\n\nIn December, Israel’s defense minister described the yellow line as “a new border line — serving as a forward defensive line for our communities and a line of operational activity.”\n\nThe military has continued leveling buildings inside the Israeli-held zone, turning already damaged neighborhoods to moonscapes. Almost all of the city of Rafah, on Gaza's border with Egypt, has been razed over the past year. The army says this is necessary to destroy tunnels and prepare the area for reconstruction.\n\nIn some places, demolitions since the ceasefire have encroached beyond the official yellow line. Since November, troops have leveled a swath of Gaza City’s Tuffah neighborhood extending some 300 meters (330 yards) outside the Israeli-held zone, according to Oct. 14 and Dec. 18 satellite photos provided by Planet Labs.\n\nAbu Jahal moved back to his damaged house in Tuffah at the ceasefire's start. He said he frequently saw new yellow barrels appear and the military forcing out anyone living on its side of the markers.\n\nOn Jan. 7, Israeli fire hit a house near him, and the residents had to evacuate, he said. Abu Jahal said his family — including his wife, their child, and seven other relatives — may also have to leave soon.\n\n“The line is getting very close,” he said.",

    "fullText": "CAIRO, Jan 15 (Reuters) - A senior figure in the armed wing of Hamas, a Hamas policeman, and a senior figure in the militant group Islamic ​Jihad were among at least ten people killed on Thursday in a ‌series of Israeli strikes across Gaza, according to local sources.\n\nLocal medics and residents reported the deaths of senior ‌Islamic Jihad operative Ashraf Al-Khatib in Nuseirat and a Hamas policeman in Gaza city. A Hamas source said that local commander Mohammed Al-Holy was killed in Deir al-Balah, earlier in the day.\n\nThe Israeli military did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the ⁠incident.\n\nHamas condemned the strikes on ‌the Al-Holy family, in a statement that did not mention Mohammed or his role in the group. It accused Israel of violating the ‍ceasefire deal in place since October, and attempting to reignite the conflict.\n\nHealth officials said the deaths included a 16-year-old.\n\nThe Israeli strikes come the day after the United States announced the start of ​the ceasefire agreement's second phase on Wednesday.\n\nIsrael and Hamas have traded blame for violations ‌of the ceasefire and remain far apart from each other on key issues.\n\nMore than 400 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers have been reported killed since the ceasefire took effect in October.\n\nIsrael has razed buildings and ordered residents out of more than half of Gaza where its troops remain. Nearly all of the territory's more than 2 million ⁠people now live in makeshift homes or damaged ​buildings in a sliver of territory where Israeli troops ​have withdrawn and Hamas has reasserted control.\n\nThe United Nations children's agency said on Tuesday that over 100 children have been killed in Gaza since ‍the ceasefire, including ⁠victims of drone and quadcopter attacks.\n\nIsrael launched its operations in Gaza in the wake of an attack by Hamas-led fighters in October 2023 which killed 1,200 people, ⁠according to Israeli tallies. Israel's assault has killed 71,000 people, according to health authorities in the strip, ‌and left much of Gaza in ruins.",

    "fullText": "Former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo received applause at a pro-Israel conference on Tuesday after declaring that “we need to make sure” that history books “don’t write about the victims of Gaza.”\n\n“The next generation of young people won’t remember October 7th in the same way. That’s true in Israel and in America and broadly in the world, and we need to make sure two things,” said Pompeo during an appearance at the MirYam Institute Israel Security Briefing.\n\nHe said, “One, it’s not that we don’t forget – we need to make sure that the story is told properly so that when the history books write this, they don’t write about the victims of Gaza, right?”\n\nFormer U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo:\n\nWe need to make sure that the story is told properly so that when the history books write this, they don’t write about the victims of Gaza… pic.twitter.com/fZjd8cFZar\n\n— Clash Report (@clashreport) January 13, 2026\n\nPompeo received applause before he then added, “I should be a little more precise. There were victims in Gaza, right? It’s true. There are civilian casualties in every war that’s ever been fought, but the victims were the people of the nation-state of Israel. The aggressor was the Iranian regime and the proxy of Hamas, and we need to make sure that the history books reflect that.”\n\nThe former Secretary of State concluded, “That requires each of us every day to talk about it in real time with our children, with our grandchildren about it in a way that is serious and thoughtful and complete and moral.”\n\nIn November 2023, a month after the Oct. 7 attacks against Israel, Pompeo called for “the complete annihilation of Hamas” in Gaza, claiming, “They’re just about killing. They’re just about destruction. They’re just about wanton rape… They don’t value human life in the way we do.”\n\nMore than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s war against Gaza since October 2023, with a further 170,000 injured, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health.\n\nAt least 382 United Nations Relief and Works Agency personnel and hundreds of journalists have also been killed.\n\nWatch above via MirYam Institute.\n\nThe post Mike Pompeo Applauded for Saying ‘We Need to Make Sure’ That History Books ‘Don’t Write About the Victims of Gaza’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "CAIRO (AP) — Hamas said Sunday it will dissolve its existing government in Gaza once a Palestinian technocratic leadership committee takes over the territory, as mandated under the U.S.-brokered peace plan. But the group gave no specifics on when the change will occur.\n\nHamas and the rival Palestinian Authority, the Palestinians’ internationally recognized representative, have not announced the names of the technocrats, who are not supposed to be politically affiliated, and it remains unclear if they will be cleared by Israel and the U.S.\n\nThe “Board of Peace,” an international body led by Trump, is supposed to oversee the government and other aspects of the ceasefire that took effect on Oct. 10, including disarming Hamas and deploying an international security force. The board's members have not been announced.\n\nMeanwhile, the post-ceasefire death toll continued to rise in Gaza, with Israeli gunfire killing three Palestinians, according to Palestinian hospital officials.\n\nThe ceasefire began with a halt in fighting and the release of hostages held in Gaza in exchange for thousands of Palestinians held by Israel. The deal is still in its first phase as efforts continue to recover the remains of the final hostage left in Gaza.\n\nAn Egyptian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss closed-door information, said Hamas was sending a delegation to talks with Egyptian, Qatari and Turkish officials about moving to the second phase.\n\nIn comments posted on his Telegram channel Sunday, Hazem Kassem, a Hamas spokesperson, called for speeding up the establishment of the technocratic committee.\n\nThe Egyptian official said Hamas will meet with other Palestinian factions this week to finalize the committee's formation. The Hamas delegation will be chaired by top negotiator Khalil al-Hayya, the official said.\n\nTrump has said the “Board of Peace \" will monitor the committee and handle the disarmament of Hamas, the deployment of an international security force, additional pullbacks of Israeli troops and Gaza's reconstruction. The U.S. has reported little progress on any of these fronts, though the members of the board are expected to be announced this week.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that Bulgarian diplomat Nickolay Mladenov has been selected as the board’s director-general. Mladenov is a former Bulgarian defense and foreign minister who served as U.N. envoy to Iraq before being appointed as the U.N. Mideast peace envoy from 2015 to 2020. During that time, he had good working relations with Israel and frequently worked to ease Israel-Hamas tensions.\n\nAlso Sunday, Israel’s Foreign Minister Gideon Saar met in Jerusalem with Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi. Saar said Israel was committed to enforcing Trump’s plan, while Motegi expressed Japan’s willingness to play an active role in the ceasefire.\n\nAccording to Japan's Foreign Ministry, Motegi visited the Civil-Military Coordination Center, where the ceasefire is being monitored. He was also set to meet Netanyahu and Palestinian officials in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nIn Gaza, two men were shot dead in the southern town of Bani Suhaila, according to Nasser Hospital, which received the bodies. Earlier Sunday, a man was killed by Israeli gunfire in the Tuffah neighborhood of Gaza City, according to Al-Ahly hospital, which received the body.\n\nIn response to questions about the Tuffah incident, Israel’s military said it had fired at and hit a “terrorist” in northern Gaza who had approached troops. In a later statement, the military said it had killed a “terrorist” in southern Gaza who approached troops.\n\nIsrael and Hamas have accused each other of violating the ceasefire. Continued Israeli strikes in Gaza have killed more than 400 Palestinians, according to local health officials.\n\nThe Israeli military says any actions since the ceasefire began have been in response to violations of the agreement.\n\nIsraeli police detain top official\n\nIsraeli police said Sunday they were questioning a top official from Netanyahu's office over possible obstruction of an investigation into last year's leak of classified military information to a German tabloid.\n\nIsraeli media identified the official as Tzachi Braverman, Netanyahu’s chief of staff, who is expected to start as the next ambassador to the United Kingdom in the coming months.\n\nHe’s the latest official to be caught up in the scandal, in which Netanyahu’s inner circle is accused of leaking confidential information to German tabloid Bild to improve public perception of the prime minister following the killing of six hostages in Gaza in 2024.\n\nIt comes after an explosive interview by Kan News with former Netanyahu spokesperson Eli Feldstein, who described a clandestine meeting with Braverman in an underground parking lot in the middle of the night in connection with the leak. Feldstein, who has been indicted, said Braverman offered to “shut down” the probe into the leaked information.\n\nOpposition leader Yair Lapid immediately called for the suspension of Braverman as ambassador. “It is unacceptable that a person suspected of involvement in obstructing a serious security investigation should be the face of Israel in one of Europe’s most important countries,” Lapid wrote on X.\n\nIn response, Saar defended Braverman’s appointment and said he would not be removed from it until formally charged or tried.\n\nFrankel reported from Jerusalem. Associated Press writer Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv, Israel, contributed to this report.\n\nThis version corrects to say the six hostages were killed in 2024.\n\nFind more of AP’s Israel-Hamas coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war",
