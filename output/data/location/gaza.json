    "fullText": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — President Donald Trump’s latest attempt to sidestep the United Nations through his new Board of Peace appears to have inadvertently backfired after major world powers rejected U.S. aspirations for it to have a larger international mandate beyond the Gaza ceasefire and recommitted their support for the over 80-year-old global institution.\n\nThe board to be chaired by Trump was originally envisioned as a small group of world leaders overseeing his plan for Gaza's future. But the Republican president’s ambitions have expanded to envisioning the board as a mediator of worldwide conflicts, a not very subtle attempt to eclipse the Security Council, which is charged with ensuring international peace and security.\n\nThe board's charter also caused some dismay by stating Trump will lead it until he resigns, with veto power over its actions and membership.\n\nHis secretary of state, Marco Rubio, tried to ease concerns by saying the board's focus right now is only on the next phases of the Gaza ceasefire plan.\n\n“This is not a replacement for the U.N., but the U.N. has served very little purpose in the case of Gaza other than the food assistance,” Rubio said at a congressional hearing Wednesday.\n\nBut Trump's promotion of a broadened mandate and his floating of an idea that the Board of Peace “might” replace the U.N. have put off major players and been dismissed by U.N. officials.\n\n“In my opinion, the basic responsibility for international peace and security lies with U.N., lies with the Security Council,” Secretary General Antonio Guterres said Thursday. “Only the Security Council can adopt decisions binding on all, and no other body or other coalition can legally be required to have all member states to comply with decisions on peace and security.”\n\nIn Security Council statements, public speeches and behind closed doors, U.S. allies and adversaries have dismissed Trump’s latest plan to overturn the post-World War II international order with what he describes as a “bold new approach to resolving global conflict.”\n\n“The U.S. rollout of the much broader Board of Peace charter turned the whole exercise into a liability,” according to the International Crisis Group’s Richard Gowan, a U.N. watcher and program director. “Countries that wanted to sign on to help Gaza saw the board turning into a Trump fan club. That was not appealing.”\n\n“If Trump had kept the focus of the board solely on Gaza, more states, including some more Europeans, would have signed up,” he said.\n\nKey Security Council members haven't signed on\n\nThe four other veto-wielding members of the Security Council — China, France, Russia and the United Kingdom — have refused or have not indicated whether they would join Trump's board, as have economic powers such as Japan and Germany.\n\nLetters sent this month inviting various world leaders to be “founding members” of the Board of Peace coincided with Trump’s vow to take over Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, and punish some European countries that resisted. That was met with stark rebuttal from Canada, Denmark and others, who said Trump’s demand threatened to upend an alliance that has been among the West's most unshakeable.\n\nShortly after, Trump pulled a dramatic reversal on Greenland, saying he had agreed with the NATO secretary-general on a “framework of a future deal” on Arctic security.\n\nAmid the diplomatic chaos, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who at the time had not responded to Trump’s Board of Peace invitation, met with Guterres in London and reiterated “the UK’s enduring support for the UN and the international rules-based system,” according to a statement.\n\nStarmer emphasized the U.N.’s “pivotal role in tackling global problems which shape lives in the UK and all over the world.” The United Kingdom later declined to join the board.\n\nFrance, Spain and Slovenia declined Trump’s offer by mentioning its overlapping and potentially conflicting agenda with the U.N.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said last week that the board goes beyond “the framework of Gaza and raises serious questions, in particular with respect to the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question.”\n\nSpain would not join because the board excluded the Palestinian Authority and because the body was “outside the framework of the United Nations,” Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said.\n\nSome countries are urging a stronger UN\n\nAmerica’s adversaries also have shunned the board.\n\n“No single country should dictate terms based on its power, and a winner-takes-all approach is unacceptable,” China’s U.N. ambassador, Fu Cong, said at a Security Council meeting Monday.\n\nHe called for the United Nations to be strengthened, not weakened, and said the Security Council’s status and role “are irreplaceable.”\n\nIn a clear reference to the Board of Peace, Fu said, “We shall not cherry-pick our commitments to the organization, nor shall we bypass the U.N. and create alternative mechanisms.”\n\nSo far, about 26 of some 60 invited countries have joined the board, and about nine European countries have declined. India did not attend Trump’s signing ceremony at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, last week but is reportedly still deciding what to do. Trump revoked Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s invitation.\n\n“It’s hardly surprising that very few governments want to join Trump’s wannabe-U.N., which so far looks more like a pay-to-play club of human rights abusers and war crimes suspects than a serious international organization,” said Louis Charbonneau, U.N. director for Human Rights Watch. “Instead of handing Trump $1 billion checks to join his Board of Peace, governments should work on strengthening the U.N.”\n\nEight Muslim nations that agreed to join the board issued a joint statement that supported its mission in Gaza and advancement of Palestinian statehood. Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates made no mention of Trump’s global peacemaking plan.\n\nThe Crisis Group’s Gowan said their focus could be a way to “get a foothold in discussions of Gaza” at the start, as Trump’s ceasefire plan has already faced several setbacks.\n\n“I remain unconvinced that this is a real long-term threat to the U.N.,” Gowan said.",

    "fullText": "The Trump administration’s plan for a New Gaza has nothing to do with peace and rebuilding, and everything to do with erasure.\n\nFor those of us who have mourned the loss of countless loved ones killed by the Israeli military over the past 27 months and watched our family homes reduced to rubble, the “New Gaza” vision unveiled by President Donald Trump and Jared Kushner in Davos is an outrageous moral affront. To see AI-generated renderings of luxury high-rises and “coastal tourism zones” atop the literal ruins of our lives is not a vision of peace. It is a blueprint for erasure.\n\nThe plan presented by Kushner—who has deep family ties to Benjamin Netanyahu and a history of funding illegal Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian land in the West Bank—imagines a “New Gaza.” This Gaza is portrayed as a futuristic dreamscape of gleaming apartment blocks, data centers, and luxury towers lining the Mediterranean shore in place of the cities and towns Israel has systematically destroyed—and in fact continues to destroy despite the supposed ceasefire. During his presentation, Kushner praised the value of Gaza’s “waterfront property,” and spoke of planning for “catastrophic success,” effectively recasting mass killing and genocide into an investment opportunity.\n\nThis plan will not achieve peace. It is designed to perpetuate and further entrench a system of Israeli apartheid that has oppressed Palestinians for eight decades, which is the root cause of all the violence between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nEven in a best-case scenario, this plan will likely make Gaza unaffordable for most Palestinians and separate them into “technocratic” camps under the oversight of an “Executive Board” of foreign CEOs run by Trump. Of even greater concern, by prioritizing “industrial zones” and “tech-driven governance” while ignoring Palestinian human rights and Israel’s ongoing campaign to make Gaza unlivable—such that Palestinians have no choice but to leave—this vision amounts to soft ethnic cleansing. Indeed, just a day before revealing this plan, news reports revealed that the Israeli government had been discussing a proposal to reopen the Rafah crossing only on the condition that outbound traffic is prioritized over entry, setting a ratio to ensure that more Palestinians leave the Strip than are allowed to return. This plan is designed to replace our indigenous people and society with a capitalist dystopia where we are merely a cheap labor force behind militarized walls.\n\nTrump and Kushner speak of a “New Gaza” without ever reckoning with Israel’s destruction of the old one. Under this administration’s direction, Gaza is being treated as a distressed asset or a failed start-up awaiting new management, rather than a homeland and the site of a crime scene, with thousands of bodies still missing underneath the rubble.\n\nI owned a home on Gaza’s beach. Israel flattened it last year, as it did tens of thousands of others, damaging or destroying more than 90 percent of all homes in Gaza. No Trump-backed panel of CEOs, autocrats, and leaders of governments complicit in Israel’s genocidal campaign can restore what was stolen by force. Yet, from a conference stage in Davos, they claim the authority to decide what comes next for a people they refuse to even look in the eye.\n\nIf the United States and the international community are serious about moving toward a true and lasting peace, they must abandon these neocolonial plans and pivot toward a solution rooted in freedom, justice, and Palestinian agency.\n\nFor starters, the process must be rooted in Palestinian self-determination; the governance of Gaza must be led by Palestinians, for Palestinians, under a unified national framework—not a “management contract” overseen by foreign trustees. Second, instead of attempting to replace the United Nations system with “free-market principles,” the United States must fully restore funding to UNRWA, ensure unobstructed aid through all crossings, and compel Israel to reverse its ongoing attempts to ban UNRWA and other aid groups from carrying out their critical work. Third, there must be absolute accountability for reconstruction: It must be treated as a legal right and a remedy for the destruction leveled by Israel with US-made weapons, not an ATM for well-connected investors. Finally, there must be a firm political horizon for when the international community recognizes a sovereign, viable Palestinian state within the 1967 borders. Without a clear path to ending Israel’s brutal occupation, any “investment” is simply a way to fund a more comfortable cage.\n\nBut before any of this can happen, Israel must be compelled to finally end its campaign of genocide in Gaza, which, as noted by Amnesty International and others, is ongoing despite the supposed ceasefire announced in October. To achieve this, the international community must move beyond rhetoric and fulfill its legal obligations under the Genocide Convention to prevent further atrocities. This requires the immediate imposition of a comprehensive arms embargo and targeted sanctions on Israel—measures that are not merely political choices but legal imperatives for every signatory committed to halting the destruction of a people.\n\nWhile Israel’s government was consulted in the drafting of Trump’s plan, the Palestinian people—the very subjects of these grand designs—have been deliberately shut out. Decisions about our land, governance, and lives are being finalized in a perversely named “Board of Peace” run by Trump.\n\nTrue peace and rebuilding acknowledge responsibility for the destruction of our homes and lives, and prioritize Palestinian agency. We do not need a “Master Plan” imposed on us by people who do not have our rights or well-being at heart. We need our homeland preserved and rebuilt, and our rights and aspirations centered.",

    "fullText": "JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli forces on Tuesday targeted at least two United Nations facilities, pushing forward with a crackdown against the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees tasked with delivering humanitarian services to millions of people across the region.\n\nCrews began bulldozing the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ’s offices in Sheikh Jarrah and fired tear gas at a vocational school in Qalandia, marking Israel’s latest and most dramatic step against UNRWA.\n\nIsrael has long railed against the agency, accusing it of being infiltrated by Hamas and saying that some of its employees were involved in the October 2023 attack that triggered Israel’s two-year war in Gaza. UNRWA leaders have said they took swift action against the employees accused of taking part in the attack, and have denied allegations that the agency tolerates or collaborates with Hamas.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday condemned Israel’s destruction of the agency's compound and called for it to be returned to the U.N.'s control.\n\n“The Secretary-General views as wholly unacceptable the continued escalatory actions against UNRWA, which are inconsistent with Israel’s clear obligations under international law,\" said Farhan Haq, the deputy U.N. spokesperson.\n\nRoland Friedrich, the agency's West Bank director, said UNRWA received word that demolition crews and police arrived at their east Jerusalem headquarters early on Tuesday. Staff have not operated out of the facility for almost a year out of safety concerns, but Israeli forces confiscated devices and forced out private security guards protecting the facility.\n\n“What we saw today is the culmination of two years of incitement and measures against UNRWA in east Jerusalem,” Friedrich said.\n\nHe said forces also began firing tear gas outside the vocational school on the outskirts of Jerusalem on Tuesday afternoon before ultimately leaving. More than 300 young refugees receive job training in technology and welding there.\n\nSome children on their way home from the school were overcome by the tear gas and a 15-year-old was hit in the eye with a rubber bullet, according to the Palestinian Authority’s Jerusalem governorate, which monitors Palestinian affairs in the area.\n\nIsraeli leaders celebrate demolition\n\nIsrael’s Foreign Ministry said the demolition enforced a new law banning UNRWA, noting that Israel owns the site and rejecting UNRWA’s claims that the move violated international law.\n\nIsrael has long claimed the agency has an anti-Israel bias. Often with little evidence, it says UNRWA employs and maintains ties with militant groups including Hamas. The U.N. has ardently denied such claims and UNRWA has said it acts quickly to purge any suspected militants among its staff.\n\nUNRWA's mandate is to provide aid and services to some 2.5 million Palestinian refugees in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem, as well as 3 million more refugees in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. The group has for years maintained infrastructure in refugee camps and also run schools and provided health care. But its operations were curtailed last year when Israel’s Knesset passed legislation severing ties and banning it from functioning in what it defines as Israel — including east Jerusalem.\n\nThe agency said the demolitions could imperil operations at the vocational center in Qalandia and heath facility in Shu'afat, where it still provides education and health services.\n\nAn Israeli flag was seen hoisted above the facility in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, where some Israeli politicians arrived on the scene to celebrate the organization's fate. National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir called it “a historic day.”\n\nThe demolition marked the culmination of years of criticism from Israel and its leaders. Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war more than two years ago, it has ramped up such attacks, saying the militants used UNRWA facilities and seized aid. It has provided little evidence for the claims, which the U.N. has denied. The International Court of Justice said in October that Israel must allow the agency to provide humanitarian assistance in Gaza.\n\nSince Israel passed its law banning the agency last year, its facilities — schools and health centers — and its headquarters have repeatedly been closed, raided or left unprotected.\n\n“This must be a wake-up call,\" Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA's commissioner-general, said in a statement on X. “What happens today to UNRWA will happen tomorrow to any other international organisation or diplomatic mission, whether in the Occupied Palestinian Territory or anywhere around the world.”\n\nMore aid groups in Gaza face pressure\n\nIsrael's ban on UNRWA dovetailed with broader efforts to deregister aid groups operating in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Israel has passed laws requiring nongovernmental organizations not to hire staff involved in activities that “delegitimize Israel” or support boycotts, demanding they register lists of names as a condition of being allowed to work.\n\nIsrael told dozens of groups — including Doctors Without Borders and CARE — that their licenses would expire at the end of 2025. The organizations say the rules are arbitrary and warned that the new ban would harm people desperately in need of humanitarian aid.\n\nSettler violence in the West Bank rose last year\n\nThe Israeli military said Tuesday that attacks carried out by Jewish settlers against Palestinians and Israeli security forces in the West Bank increased by 27% last year compared with 2024.\n\nThere were 867 reports of “nationalistic crimes” — with the number of severe incidents up by more than 50%, according to internal statistics from the Israeli military and the country’s Shin Bet domestic security service.\n\nMounting settler violence in the West Bank has emptied villages since the war between Israel and Hamas erupted, according to B’Tselem, an Israeli rights group helping the residents.\n\nThe Israeli military has carried out large-scale operations in the West Bank targeting militants that have killed hundreds of Palestinians. There also has been a rise in Palestinian attacks on Israelis.\n\nIsraeli authorities have a mixed relationship with settlers, at times dismantling unauthorized outposts while also deploying forces to protect them from Palestinians.\n\nJulia Frankel and Shlomo Mor in Jerusalem and Edith M.

    "fullText": "The siege of Gaza, as part of the Wars of Alexander the Great, took place in October of 332 BC. Resulting in a victory for Macedon, it ended the 31st Dynasty of Egypt, which functioned as a satrapy under the Achaemenid Persian Empire.\n\nAlexander succeeded in breaching the walls of Gaza by utilizing the engines that he had employed earlier that year, during the siege of Tyre brought by Hephaestion.[3] Following three unsuccessful assaults, the Macedonian army was able to storm and take the Gazan stronghold.[4]\n\nBatis, the military commander of Gaza's fortress,[5] expected to hold the city as well as the rest of Egypt in complete subjection until the raising of another army by Persian king Darius III; confronting Alexander at Gaza was crucial to denying the Macedonians a route into the Egyptian mainland.[6] The fortress was located on an eminence, on the edge of a desert from which the surrounding area could be easily controlled, including the main road from Assyria to Egypt. The city, over 18 metres (60 ft) high, was traditionally employed to control the surrounding area, which, even then, was a hotbed of dissent.[6] Batis was aware that Alexander was leading his army southward after successfully conquering Tyre, and therefore provisioned Gaza for a long siege by the Macedonian army.[6] It is also likely that he was aware of Alexander's intention to secure absolute control over the Mediterranean coast before mounting an invasion of the Persian mainland.\n\nUpon arriving, Alexander camped near the southern side of the city and deemed the southern walls as the weakest.[7] It is alleged that the mounds were built quickly, despite the engineers' belief they could not be completed due to the nature of Gaza's fortifications.[8]\n\nOne day during the siege, the Gazans made a sortie against enemy siege equipment constructed on site, and Alexander led his shield bearing guards into counterattack.[3] Alexander's shoulder was injured in the attempt.[8] According to Arrian, the rest of the mound was completed shortly after, around the whole of Gaza.[8] At some undefined period after this, the siege equipment from Tyre arrived, and was put into use also. It was after this that major sections of the wall were broken by the Macedonians.[8] After three attempts to enter the city, the Macedonians finally entered the city. The Gazans fought bitterly; at one point, an Arab mercenary pretended to surrender and after being taken to the Macedonian camp, attacked Alexander who suffered a minor injury before the Arab was struck down.[1]\n\nBatis refused to surrender to Alexander.[9] When Gaza was taken, the male population was put to the sword and the women and children were sold into slavery.[10] In the battle, there were 10,000 Gazaean casualties.[11]\n\nAccording to the Roman historian Quintus Curtius Rufus,[12] Batis was killed by Alexander in imitation of Achilles' treatment of the fallen Hector:[13] A rope was forced through Batis's ankles, probably between the ankle bone and the Achilles tendon, and Batis was dragged alive by chariot beneath the walls of the city until he died.[12] Alexander, who admired courage in his enemies and might have been inclined to show mercy to the brave Persian general, was infuriated at Batis's refusal to kneel and by the enemy commander's haughty silence and contemptuous manner.[14][15]\n\nAs a result of the siege, Alexander was allowed to proceed south into Egypt securely, without his line of communications being threatened from the North by Batis from Gaza.",

    "fullText": "CAIRO (AP) — A dividing line, at times invisible, can mean life or death for Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nThose sheltering near the territory's “yellow line” that the Israeli military withdrew to as part of the October ceasefire say they live in fear as Israeli soldiers direct near-daily fire at anyone who crosses or even lingers near it.\n\nOf the 447 Palestinians killed between the ceasefire taking effect and Tuesday, at least 77 were killed by Israeli gunfire near the line, including 62 who crossed it, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Among them were teenagers and young children, The Associated Press found.\n\nAnd although the military has placed some yellow barrels and concrete barriers delineating the limits of the Palestinian zone, the line is still unmarked in certain places and in others was laid nearly half a kilometer (0.3 miles) deeper than what was agreed to in the ceasefire deal, expanding the part of Gaza that Israel controls, according to Palestinians and mapping experts.\n\n“We stay away from the barrels. No one dares to get close” said Gaza City resident Ahmed Abu Jahal, noting that the markers are less than 100 meters (110 yards) from his house — instead of the roughly 500 meters (546 yards) outlined in a map put out by the Israeli military.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the military had acknowledged killing 57 people around the yellow line, saying most were militants. It said its troops are complying with the rules of engagement in order to counter militant groups, and are informing Palestinians of the line’s location and marking it on the ground to “reduce friction and prevent misunderstandings.”\n\nUnder the ceasefire, Israel withdrew its troops to a buffer zone that is up to 7 kilometers (4 miles) deep and includes most of Gaza's arable land, its elevated points and all of its border crossings. That hems more than 2 million Palestinians into a strip along the coastline and central Gaza.\n\nPeople of all ages, some already dead, have been showing up almost daily at the emergency room of Gaza City's Al-Ahli hospital with bullet wounds from straying near the line, said hospital director Fadel Naeem.\n\nAmid the vast destruction in Gaza, the demarcation line often isn't easy to detect, Naeem said. He recounted picking his way through undamaged paths during a recent visit to the southern city of Khan Younis. He didn't notice he was almost across the line until locals shouted at him to turn back, he said.\n\nThe Israeli military said most of the people it has killed crossing the line posed a threat to its troops. According to a military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military rules, troops issue audible warnings and then fire warning shots whenever someone crosses the line. Many civilians retreat when warning shots are fired, though some have been killed, the official acknowledged.\n\nKilled while playing near the line\n\nZaher Shamia, 17, lived with his grandfather in a tent 300 meters (330 yards) from the line in northern Gaza’s Jabaliya refugee camp. On Dec. 10, he was playing with his cousin and some friends near the line, according to video he took before his death.\n\nSuddenly, shots rang out and the video stopped. Soldiers approaching the line with an armored bulldozer had fired on the teens, hitting Zaher, said a witness.\n\nA neighbor eventually found Zaher’s body, which had been crushed by the bulldozer, said Zaher's grandfather, Kamal al-Beih: “We only recognized him from his head.\"\n\nTwo doctors, Mohamed Abu Selmiya and Rami Mhanna, confirmed that the teen had been killed by gunshots and then run over by a bulldozer. The military official said he was aware that Shamia was a civilian and that the military was looking into it.\n\nMaram Atta said that on Dec. 7, her 3-year-old daughter, Ahed al-Bayouk, was playing with siblings outside of their tent, which was near the yellow line along Gaza's southern coast. Atta was preparing lentils when she heard aircraft overhead, then shots.\n\nA stray projectile whizzed close to her and struck Ahed, who was dead before they reached the clinic.\n\n“I lost my daughter to what they keep calling a ‘ceasefire’” said Atta, crying. “What ceasefire are they talking about?”\n\nA military official denied the killing.\n\nThe line's exact location is ambiguous, differing on maps put out by the Israeli military and the White House.\n\nNeither matches the line troops appear to be marking on the ground, according to Palestinians and geolocation specialists.\n\nChris Osiek, an open source intelligence analyst and consultant, has geolocated a number of yellow blocks based on social media videos. He found at least four urban areas where troops set the blocks several hundred meters deeper into Gaza than the military map-specified yellow line.\n\n“This is basically what you get when you simply let Trump make an image and post it on Truth Social and let the IDF make their own,” he said, using the acronym for the military. “If it’s not a proper system, with coordinates that make it easy for people to navigate where it is, then you leave the ambiguity free for the IDF to interpret the yellow line how they basically want.”\n\nThe military official dismissed such criticism, saying any deviations from the map amount to just a few meters. But to Palestinians hemmed in by widespread destruction and displacement, every few meters lost is another house that can't be sheltered in — another they doubt will ever be returned.\n\n‘The line is getting very close’\n\nUnder the ceasefire, Israeli forces are only supposed to remain at the yellow line until a fuller withdrawal, though the agreement doesn't give a timeline for that. With the next steps in the deal lagging and troops digging into positions on the Israeli side, though, Palestinians wonder if they are witnessing a permanent land takeover.\n\nIn December, Israel’s defense minister described the yellow line as “a new border line — serving as a forward defensive line for our communities and a line of operational activity.”\n\nThe military has continued leveling buildings inside the Israeli-held zone, turning already damaged neighborhoods to moonscapes. Almost all of the city of Rafah, on Gaza's border with Egypt, has been razed over the past year. The army says this is necessary to destroy tunnels and prepare the area for reconstruction.\n\nIn some places, demolitions since the ceasefire have encroached beyond the official yellow line. Since November, troops have leveled a swath of Gaza City’s Tuffah neighborhood extending some 300 meters (330 yards) outside the Israeli-held zone, according to Oct. 14 and Dec. 18 satellite photos provided by Planet Labs.\n\nAbu Jahal moved back to his damaged house in Tuffah at the ceasefire's start. He said he frequently saw new yellow barrels appear and the military forcing out anyone living on its side of the markers.\n\nOn Jan. 7, Israeli fire hit a house near him, and the residents had to evacuate, he said. Abu Jahal said his family — including his wife, their child, and seven other relatives — may also have to leave soon.\n\n“The line is getting very close,” he said.",

    "fullText": "CAIRO (AP) — Hamas said Sunday it will dissolve its existing government in Gaza once a Palestinian technocratic leadership committee takes over the territory, as mandated under the U.S.-brokered peace plan. But the group gave no specifics on when the change will occur.\n\nHamas and the rival Palestinian Authority, the Palestinians’ internationally recognized representative, have not announced the names of the technocrats, who are not supposed to be politically affiliated, and it remains unclear if they will be cleared by Israel and the U.S.\n\nThe “Board of Peace,” an international body led by Trump, is supposed to oversee the government and other aspects of the ceasefire that took effect on Oct. 10, including disarming Hamas and deploying an international security force. The board's members have not been announced.\n\nMeanwhile, the post-ceasefire death toll continued to rise in Gaza, with Israeli gunfire killing three Palestinians, according to Palestinian hospital officials.\n\nThe ceasefire began with a halt in fighting and the release of hostages held in Gaza in exchange for thousands of Palestinians held by Israel. The deal is still in its first phase as efforts continue to recover the remains of the final hostage left in Gaza.\n\nAn Egyptian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss closed-door information, said Hamas was sending a delegation to talks with Egyptian, Qatari and Turkish officials about moving to the second phase.\n\nIn comments posted on his Telegram channel Sunday, Hazem Kassem, a Hamas spokesperson, called for speeding up the establishment of the technocratic committee.\n\nThe Egyptian official said Hamas will meet with other Palestinian factions this week to finalize the committee's formation. The Hamas delegation will be chaired by top negotiator Khalil al-Hayya, the official said.\n\nTrump has said the “Board of Peace \" will monitor the committee and handle the disarmament of Hamas, the deployment of an international security force, additional pullbacks of Israeli troops and Gaza's reconstruction. The U.S. has reported little progress on any of these fronts, though the members of the board are expected to be announced this week.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that Bulgarian diplomat Nickolay Mladenov has been selected as the board’s director-general. Mladenov is a former Bulgarian defense and foreign minister who served as U.N. envoy to Iraq before being appointed as the U.N. Mideast peace envoy from 2015 to 2020. During that time, he had good working relations with Israel and frequently worked to ease Israel-Hamas tensions.\n\nAlso Sunday, Israel’s Foreign Minister Gideon Saar met in Jerusalem with Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi. Saar said Israel was committed to enforcing Trump’s plan, while Motegi expressed Japan’s willingness to play an active role in the ceasefire.\n\nAccording to Japan's Foreign Ministry, Motegi visited the Civil-Military Coordination Center, where the ceasefire is being monitored. He was also set to meet Netanyahu and Palestinian officials in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nIn Gaza, two men were shot dead in the southern town of Bani Suhaila, according to Nasser Hospital, which received the bodies. Earlier Sunday, a man was killed by Israeli gunfire in the Tuffah neighborhood of Gaza City, according to Al-Ahly hospital, which received the body.\n\nIn response to questions about the Tuffah incident, Israel’s military said it had fired at and hit a “terrorist” in northern Gaza who had approached troops. In a later statement, the military said it had killed a “terrorist” in southern Gaza who approached troops.\n\nIsrael and Hamas have accused each other of violating the ceasefire. Continued Israeli strikes in Gaza have killed more than 400 Palestinians, according to local health officials.\n\nThe Israeli military says any actions since the ceasefire began have been in response to violations of the agreement.\n\nIsraeli police detain top official\n\nIsraeli police said Sunday they were questioning a top official from Netanyahu's office over possible obstruction of an investigation into last year's leak of classified military information to a German tabloid.\n\nIsraeli media identified the official as Tzachi Braverman, Netanyahu’s chief of staff, who is expected to start as the next ambassador to the United Kingdom in the coming months.\n\nHe’s the latest official to be caught up in the scandal, in which Netanyahu’s inner circle is accused of leaking confidential information to German tabloid Bild to improve public perception of the prime minister following the killing of six hostages in Gaza in 2024.\n\nIt comes after an explosive interview by Kan News with former Netanyahu spokesperson Eli Feldstein, who described a clandestine meeting with Braverman in an underground parking lot in the middle of the night in connection with the leak. Feldstein, who has been indicted, said Braverman offered to “shut down” the probe into the leaked information.\n\nOpposition leader Yair Lapid immediately called for the suspension of Braverman as ambassador. “It is unacceptable that a person suspected of involvement in obstructing a serious security investigation should be the face of Israel in one of Europe’s most important countries,” Lapid wrote on X.\n\nIn response, Saar defended Braverman’s appointment and said he would not be removed from it until formally charged or tried.\n\nFrankel reported from Jerusalem. Associated Press writer Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv, Israel, contributed to this report.\n\nThis version corrects to say the six hostages were killed in 2024.\n\nFind more of AP’s Israel-Hamas coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war",
