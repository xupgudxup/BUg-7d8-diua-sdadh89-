    "fullText": "CAIRO, Jan 15 (Reuters) - A senior figure in the armed wing of Hamas, a Hamas policeman, and a senior figure in the militant group Islamic ​Jihad were among at least ten people killed on Thursday in a ‌series of Israeli strikes across Gaza, according to local sources.\n\nLocal medics and residents reported the deaths of senior ‌Islamic Jihad operative Ashraf Al-Khatib in Nuseirat and a Hamas policeman in Gaza city. A Hamas source said that local commander Mohammed Al-Holy was killed in Deir al-Balah, earlier in the day.\n\nThe Israeli military did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the ⁠incident.\n\nHamas condemned the strikes on ‌the Al-Holy family, in a statement that did not mention Mohammed or his role in the group. It accused Israel of violating the ‍ceasefire deal in place since October, and attempting to reignite the conflict.\n\nHealth officials said the deaths included a 16-year-old.\n\nThe Israeli strikes come the day after the United States announced the start of ​the ceasefire agreement's second phase on Wednesday.\n\nIsrael and Hamas have traded blame for violations ‌of the ceasefire and remain far apart from each other on key issues.\n\nMore than 400 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers have been reported killed since the ceasefire took effect in October.\n\nIsrael has razed buildings and ordered residents out of more than half of Gaza where its troops remain. Nearly all of the territory's more than 2 million ⁠people now live in makeshift homes or damaged ​buildings in a sliver of territory where Israeli troops ​have withdrawn and Hamas has reasserted control.\n\nThe United Nations children's agency said on Tuesday that over 100 children have been killed in Gaza since ‍the ceasefire, including ⁠victims of drone and quadcopter attacks.\n\nIsrael launched its operations in Gaza in the wake of an attack by Hamas-led fighters in October 2023 which killed 1,200 people, ⁠according to Israeli tallies. Israel's assault has killed 71,000 people, according to health authorities in the strip, ‌and left much of Gaza in ruins.",

    "fullText": "Former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo received applause at a pro-Israel conference on Tuesday after declaring that “we need to make sure” that history books “don’t write about the victims of Gaza.”\n\n“The next generation of young people won’t remember October 7th in the same way. That’s true in Israel and in America and broadly in the world, and we need to make sure two things,” said Pompeo during an appearance at the MirYam Institute Israel Security Briefing.\n\nHe said, “One, it’s not that we don’t forget – we need to make sure that the story is told properly so that when the history books write this, they don’t write about the victims of Gaza, right?”\n\nFormer U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo:\n\nWe need to make sure that the story is told properly so that when the history books write this, they don’t write about the victims of Gaza… pic.twitter.com/fZjd8cFZar\n\n— Clash Report (@clashreport) January 13, 2026\n\nPompeo received applause before he then added, “I should be a little more precise. There were victims in Gaza, right? It’s true. There are civilian casualties in every war that’s ever been fought, but the victims were the people of the nation-state of Israel. The aggressor was the Iranian regime and the proxy of Hamas, and we need to make sure that the history books reflect that.”\n\nThe former Secretary of State concluded, “That requires each of us every day to talk about it in real time with our children, with our grandchildren about it in a way that is serious and thoughtful and complete and moral.”\n\nIn November 2023, a month after the Oct. 7 attacks against Israel, Pompeo called for “the complete annihilation of Hamas” in Gaza, claiming, “They’re just about killing. They’re just about destruction. They’re just about wanton rape… They don’t value human life in the way we do.”\n\nMore than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s war against Gaza since October 2023, with a further 170,000 injured, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health.\n\nAt least 382 United Nations Relief and Works Agency personnel and hundreds of journalists have also been killed.\n\nWatch above via MirYam Institute.\n\nThe post Mike Pompeo Applauded for Saying ‘We Need to Make Sure’ That History Books ‘Don’t Write About the Victims of Gaza’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "CAIRO (AP) — Hamas said Sunday it will dissolve its existing government in Gaza once a Palestinian technocratic leadership committee takes over the territory, as mandated under the U.S.-brokered peace plan. But the group gave no specifics on when the change will occur.\n\nHamas and the rival Palestinian Authority, the Palestinians’ internationally recognized representative, have not announced the names of the technocrats, who are not supposed to be politically affiliated, and it remains unclear if they will be cleared by Israel and the U.S.\n\nThe “Board of Peace,” an international body led by Trump, is supposed to oversee the government and other aspects of the ceasefire that took effect on Oct. 10, including disarming Hamas and deploying an international security force. The board's members have not been announced.\n\nMeanwhile, the post-ceasefire death toll continued to rise in Gaza, with Israeli gunfire killing three Palestinians, according to Palestinian hospital officials.\n\nThe ceasefire began with a halt in fighting and the release of hostages held in Gaza in exchange for thousands of Palestinians held by Israel. The deal is still in its first phase as efforts continue to recover the remains of the final hostage left in Gaza.\n\nAn Egyptian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss closed-door information, said Hamas was sending a delegation to talks with Egyptian, Qatari and Turkish officials about moving to the second phase.\n\nIn comments posted on his Telegram channel Sunday, Hazem Kassem, a Hamas spokesperson, called for speeding up the establishment of the technocratic committee.\n\nThe Egyptian official said Hamas will meet with other Palestinian factions this week to finalize the committee's formation. The Hamas delegation will be chaired by top negotiator Khalil al-Hayya, the official said.\n\nTrump has said the “Board of Peace \" will monitor the committee and handle the disarmament of Hamas, the deployment of an international security force, additional pullbacks of Israeli troops and Gaza's reconstruction. The U.S. has reported little progress on any of these fronts, though the members of the board are expected to be announced this week.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that Bulgarian diplomat Nickolay Mladenov has been selected as the board’s director-general. Mladenov is a former Bulgarian defense and foreign minister who served as U.N. envoy to Iraq before being appointed as the U.N. Mideast peace envoy from 2015 to 2020. During that time, he had good working relations with Israel and frequently worked to ease Israel-Hamas tensions.\n\nAlso Sunday, Israel’s Foreign Minister Gideon Saar met in Jerusalem with Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi. Saar said Israel was committed to enforcing Trump’s plan, while Motegi expressed Japan’s willingness to play an active role in the ceasefire.\n\nAccording to Japan's Foreign Ministry, Motegi visited the Civil-Military Coordination Center, where the ceasefire is being monitored. He was also set to meet Netanyahu and Palestinian officials in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nIn Gaza, two men were shot dead in the southern town of Bani Suhaila, according to Nasser Hospital, which received the bodies. Earlier Sunday, a man was killed by Israeli gunfire in the Tuffah neighborhood of Gaza City, according to Al-Ahly hospital, which received the body.\n\nIn response to questions about the Tuffah incident, Israel’s military said it had fired at and hit a “terrorist” in northern Gaza who had approached troops. In a later statement, the military said it had killed a “terrorist” in southern Gaza who approached troops.\n\nIsrael and Hamas have accused each other of violating the ceasefire. Continued Israeli strikes in Gaza have killed more than 400 Palestinians, according to local health officials.\n\nThe Israeli military says any actions since the ceasefire began have been in response to violations of the agreement.\n\nIsraeli police detain top official\n\nIsraeli police said Sunday they were questioning a top official from Netanyahu's office over possible obstruction of an investigation into last year's leak of classified military information to a German tabloid.\n\nIsraeli media identified the official as Tzachi Braverman, Netanyahu’s chief of staff, who is expected to start as the next ambassador to the United Kingdom in the coming months.\n\nHe’s the latest official to be caught up in the scandal, in which Netanyahu’s inner circle is accused of leaking confidential information to German tabloid Bild to improve public perception of the prime minister following the killing of six hostages in Gaza in 2024.\n\nIt comes after an explosive interview by Kan News with former Netanyahu spokesperson Eli Feldstein, who described a clandestine meeting with Braverman in an underground parking lot in the middle of the night in connection with the leak. Feldstein, who has been indicted, said Braverman offered to “shut down” the probe into the leaked information.\n\nOpposition leader Yair Lapid immediately called for the suspension of Braverman as ambassador. “It is unacceptable that a person suspected of involvement in obstructing a serious security investigation should be the face of Israel in one of Europe’s most important countries,” Lapid wrote on X.\n\nIn response, Saar defended Braverman’s appointment and said he would not be removed from it until formally charged or tried.\n\nFrankel reported from Jerusalem. Associated Press writer Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv, Israel, contributed to this report.\n\nThis version corrects to say the six hostages were killed in 2024.\n\nFind more of AP’s Israel-Hamas coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war",
