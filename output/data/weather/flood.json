    "title": "I cover side hustles and started my own in 2025. Here's the best business advice I heard all year.",
    "description": "Among the flood of advice I've received, read, and reported on in 2025, here's what stuck with me the most.",
    "fullText": "There's an overwhelming amount of business advice out there.\n\nI hear a lot of it, by nature of my reporting and asking successful entrepreneurs what they wished they'd done differently, or what they'd tell prospective founders. Ever since starting my own business selling pickleball paddles — inspired by the plethora of Amazon sellers I interview — I hear even more (often unsolicited) advice. Everyone has something to say.\n\nAmong the flood of advice I've received, read, and reported on in 2025, here's what stuck with me the most.\n\nI know it sounds clichéd to \"follow your passion,\" but if you're starting a business — especially as a side hustle — you don't want it to feel like work. You don't want it to feel like a pesky chore, because it's what you'll be doing at the end of your workday on a Wednesday night, or at the start of your weekend on a Saturday morning.\n\nEven when you're not dedicating time to the business, it has a way of seeping into your shower thoughts or preventing you from falling asleep at night. If something is going to take up so much space, it might as well be something you care about.\n\nMy business partner and I weren't always going to sell pickleball paddles. That idea came from a conversation with a top Amazon seller, whom we consulted in the ideation stage. He encouraged us to think about our interests and how we generally spend our time. \"What do you like? What are you good at?\" he asked us. \"Start there.\"\n\nAs former collegiate tennis players, it seemed obvious that we should incorporate racket sports in our e-commerce business — and I'm so glad we did, because if we were selling kitchen utensils or candles or something we didn't know anything about or care much for, I doubt we'd still be plugging away after a year of learning lessons and lackluster sales. But we are. We believe in our product, and we're having fun trying to move inventory. Rather than feeling burned out, we feel energized.\n\nFigure out what you want, identify someone who already has it, and ask them — politely — for a bit of their time. Then, ask questions. Get curious. This is good, general life and business advice that frequently comes up in interviews with people across all industries. I never tire of it.\n\nWhy try to do everything on your own when you can potentially learn from someone else's mistakes and fast-track your path to success?\n\nIn addition to seeking out mentors, put yourself in the same room — virtual or physical — as people with similar goals. I've heard it over and over again: Who you hang around matters.\n\n\"Networking event\" or \"conference\" doesn't sound particularly fun or exciting, especially to an introvert. Despite reporting on the benefits of attending such events, I had never bought in — until earlier this year, when I spent 10 hours at a conference for real estate investors pursuing financial independence.\n\nI wrote about what it was like being in a room with hundreds of like-minded investors, describing it as \"powerful,\" and mentioning three main takeaways:\n\nOne, you learn — from people who are more successful than you.\n\nTwo, you connect — with people who could become your business partner, mentor, or client.\n\nThree, you gain momentum — perhaps just enough to inspire a key pivot, or take your first step into business, or simply keep the fire burning.\n\nI love an underdog story. Who doesn't? I appreciate grit, and I also believe the underrated, chip-on-your-shoulder mindset can be an asset. Just look at Stephen Curry, who was largely overlooked at the college level before blossoming into an NBA MVP.\n\nOr, to keep things more relevant, consider Kyle Ray. He's a college dropout I spoke with earlier this year who turned his window cleaning side hustle into a six-figure business that services hundreds of clients across Texas.\n\nHe told me that he didn't do great in school and, from a young age, his teachers tried to convince him that \"the best you can hope for is to be a manager of a restaurant.\" Rather than capitulating, he used their declaration as fuel. \"That's just been an internal driver, like, 'I'm going to prove this person wrong.'\"\n\nPeople will tell you that your idea is bad or that it won't work. \"The pickleball space is too competitive,\" one naysayer told me. \"I wouldn't want to be in your shoes!\" said another.\n\nRather than letting unproductive feedback discourage you, use it as motivation. It's fun being an underdog with something to prove. It's also really difficult. Underdog status or not, building a profitable, lasting business takes time, effort, and perhaps even a stroke of luck or two. It's often a series of many small steps over the course of many months and years that lead to success worthy of a feature in a news publication.\n\nI'm hyper-aware that for every successful entrepreneur I interview, there are 100 who have failed. But I'm also aware that you won't have a chance if you don't at least try.",

    "fullText": "WRIGHTWOOD, Calif. (AP) — A strong storm system that brought relentless winds, rain and snowfall to California this week was expected to ease Friday, but there was still a risk of high surf along the coast, flash flooding near Los Angeles and avalanches in the Sierra Nevada.\n\nWaves near the San Francisco Bay Area could reach up to 25 feet (7.6 meters) Friday, parts of Southern California were at risk of flooding, and avalanches could hit the Lake Tahoe area, officials warned. Residents were told to be ready to evacuate the mountain town of Wrightwood about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northeast of Los Angeles because of mudslides.\n\nAtmospheric rivers carried massive plumes of moisture from the tropics during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year. The storms were blamed for at least two deaths earlier in the week.\n\nThe system brought the wettest Christmas season to downtown Los Angeles in 54 years, the National Weather Service said.\n\nRoads in the 5,000-resident town of Wrightwood were covered in rocks, debris and thick mud on Thursday. With power out, a gas station and coffee shop running on generators were serving as hubs for residents and visitors.\n\n“It’s really a crazy Christmas,” said Jill Jenkins, who was spending the holiday with her 13-year-old grandson, Hunter Lopiccolo.\n\nLopiccolo said the family almost evacuated the previous day, when water washed away a chunk of their backyard. But they decided to stay and still celebrated the holiday. Lopiccolo got a new snowboard and e-bike.\n\n“We just played card games all night with candles and flashlights,” he said.\n\nDavey Schneider hiked a mile and a half (1.6 kilometers) through rain and floodwater up to his shins from his Wrightwood residence Wednesday to rescue cats from his grandfather’s house.\n\n“I wanted to help them out because I wasn’t confident that they were going to live,” Schneider said Thursday. “Fortunately, they all lived. They’re all okay — just a little bit scared.”\n\nArlene Corte said roads in town turned into rivers, but her house was not damaged.\n\n“It could be a whole lot worse,” she said. “We’re here talking.”\n\nWith more rain on the way, more than 150 firefighters were stationed in the area, said San Bernardino County Fire spokesman Shawn Millerick.\n\n“We’re ready,” he said. “It’s all hands on deck at this point.”\n\nA falling tree killed a San Diego man Wednesday, news outlets reported. Farther north, a Sacramento sheriff’s deputy died in what appeared to be a weather-related crash.\n\nAreas along the coast, including Malibu, were under a flood watch until Friday afternoon, and wind and flood advisories were issued for much of the Sacramento Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nSouthern California typically gets half an inch to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 centimeters) of rain this time of year, but this week many areas could see between 4 and 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters), with even \n\nMore wind and heavy snow was expected in the Sierra Nevada, where gusts created “near white-out conditions” and made mountain pass travel treacherous.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom declared emergencies in six counties to allow state assistance.\n\nThe state deployed resources and first responders to several coastal and Southern California counties, and the California National Guard was on standby.",

Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Shasta counties on Wednesday. Some areas had already received 4 to 8 inches of rain by Wednesday morning, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nAnother wave of the storm was expected to hit on Christmas Day, with flood and wind advisories for \"life-threatening\" storm conditions from the National Weather Service remaining in effect until Thursday afternoon.\n\nOver 163,000 homes and businesses across California were still without power on Christmas morning, according to poweroutage.us.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Redding Police Department reported one storm-related fatality in Northern California. Two more deaths occurred in South Sacramento and San Diego, CNN reported.\n\nThe storms are affecting the entire state, from San Francisco to Los Angeles.\n\nThe storms began on Christmas Eve, with the Weather Prediction Center warning that a \"dangerous scenario\" was on the way.\n\nPer CNN, 15 million people were still in the moderate-risk zone for flooding on Christmas Day.\n\nThe airport saw 3 inches of rainfall on the 24th.\n\nAccording to CNN, emergency crews were pulling people from flooded cars and homes, and some people even had to be rescued from their roofs via helicopter.\n\nSarah Bailey, a resident of the Wrightwood area for two decades, told the Times this was the worst flooding she'd seen.\n\nChristopher Prater, a spokesman for the San Bernardino County Fire Department, told the outlet they'd received \"dozens\" of rescue calls on Wednesday night.\n\nA Pineapple Express is an atmospheric river, a band of concentrated water vapor. These \"rivers\" are responsible for 30 to 50% of California's rainfall.\n\nThe power outages are focused in Northern California, according to The New York Times.\n\nAny additional rainfall that comes on the 25th and 26th, even if it's less intense, could cause more flooding and debris to wash away, especially in areas that were devastated by the LA wildfires earlier this year.\n\n\"I am urging all Angelenos to stay safe and be extremely careful on the roads if you absolutely must travel,\" Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles said in a statement. \"Please do not take this storm lightly.\"",

    "title": "Taiwan needs to flood the battlefield with cheap, mobile, and survivable weapons to counter China, former senior military officer says",
    "description": "In a war with China, Taiwan could have an asymmetric advantage with a high volume of cheap and survivable weapons, a retired admiral said.",
    "fullText": "To prepare for a possible all-out war with China, Taiwan should focus on fielding substantial numbers of cheap, mobile, and survivable weapons, a former top Taiwanese defense official said.\n\nTaiwan currently faces two types of conflict — what experts and officials have referred to as China's gray-zone activities that are just below the threshold of war and the potential for a full-scale Chinese invasion. Countering both requires an array of weaponry.\n\nAt a Hudson Institute think tank event earlier this month, retired admiral and former chief of the general staff for Taiwan's defense ministry Lee Hsi-Min said Taiwan needed to prioritize the existential threat of a Chinese invasion. Gray-zone actions, such as frequent aircraft incursions, strain resources and stress assets and troops. The other could be catastrophic, as war games have shown.\n\n\"We need a large number of the distributed, mobile, survivable, lethal\" weapons, Lee argued, and those systems need to be low-cost, high-volume, and highly survivable in a fight, he added.\n\nAsymmetric warfare is a strategy that uses large numbers of inexpensive, mobile, hard-to-target systems — like drones, missiles, and dispersed units — to blunt a larger military's advantages by denying it easy targets and inflicting outsized damage. Think drones blowing up tanks in Ukraine or sinking Russian warships.\n\nLee argues that Taiwan's survival in a war against China depends on exactly this kind of strategy.\n\nTaiwan has aggressively pursued a strategy focused on weapons that fit these bills, including various types of drones, sensors, jamming, and anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles. Broader elements of increased investments in asymmetric warfare plans include how the civilian population of Taiwan is trained for a potential Chinese invasion and how the Taiwanese military would use urban warfare to hold off Chinese forces.\n\nThis doesn't mean conventional platforms and high-end weapons aren't valuable, Lee said, especially for helping Taiwan deter the everyday activities the Chinese military engages in, such as aggressive actions in the air and sea and massive exercises regularly held nearby. However, \"we need scalable\" and \"smart enough\" weapons, he said.\n\n\"If we are conducting the protracted war, sometimes the quantity means quality,\" Lee said. \"If we only have a kind of a small number of the advanced, sophisticated platform, I think we will have a big problem if China decided to attack Taiwan.\"\n\nSimilar lessons are being learned from the war in Ukraine. Soldiers, veterans, and drone makers have all said that a limited arsenal of exquisite systems isn't the right fit for a long war. The need is large volumes of cheap weapons. In warfare, sustainability is key. Overengineering and overspending simply aren't sustainable in a high-end fight.\n\nLee previously argued for asymmetric warfare and more mobile, uncrewed weapons and systems rather than buying more conventional weaponry like fighter jets and tanks in his \"Overall Defense Concept.\"\n\nIn 2020, he wrote in an article for The Diplomat that the idea is based on the premise that China will continue to see claiming Taiwan as a national and existential priority and Beijing will keep pouring money and resources into its military, which is vastly out-scaling Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan's government budgets for defense have increased substantially in recent years, and it continues to buy missiles, air defense systems, and drones from the US and other allies and partners.\n\nBut given the significant disparity between China and Taiwan's militaries and capabilities, \"Taiwan must abandon notions of a traditional war of attrition with the PLA [People’s Liberation Army],\" Lee and co-author Eric Lee, then a researcher at the Project 2049 Institute, wrote.\n\nTaiwan faces a substantially stronger adversary, and thus \"embracing an effective asymmetric defense posture and incorporating tactical asymmetric capabilities could compensate for Taiwan's disadvantage on paper and prevent the PLA from getting boots on the ground,\" they argued.\n\nAt the moment, Taiwan is leaning on a mix of capabilities. This month, the US announced its largest-ever weapons sale to Taiwan, at $11 billion. It includes High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, Army Tactical Missile Systems, Javelin missiles, howitzers, and drones.\n\nTaiwan's defense ministry said the weapons help bolster its self-defense and deterrence capabilities. China's foreign ministry said the sale violated agreements between Beijing and Washington and risked military confrontation with Taiwan.\n\nAn important piece of Taiwan's asymmetric strategy is rapid investment in domestic drone production, informed by lessons from Ukraine and collaborations with US and European firms. Taipei aims to produce 200,000 drones annually by 2030 and is investing billions into other defense systems, including a new air-defense network known as T-Dome.",

    "fullText": "PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) – Clackamas County is facing a triple threat Thursday night as flood warnings impact at least three different rivers and major creeks.\n\nMolalla officials say the city could soon find itself cut off if those rivers — Clackamas River, Pudding River, and Johnson Creek — rise any higher.\n\nLIVE Updates: Atmospheric river hits Oregon, SW Washington, bringing intense rain, wind\n\nThe National Weather Service predicts that Johnson Creek will rise above flood stage at Sycamore Thursday afternoon, and the Clackamas River near Estacada is expected to reach major flood stage later in the night.\n\nBut for the city, impacts are already stacking up.\n\nUtility crews have been working along Hwy 213 between Molalla and Oregon City, repairing downed power lines after trees toppled in strong winds.\n\nPortland General Electric has reported widespread outages across Clackamas County with some residents going into day two without power. Conditions have prompted the Molalla River School District to cancel class Thursday as city officials call on residents to prepare for this next round of water.\n\n“If the Molalla River and some of those other rivers actually do reach flood stage, we kind of become isolated,” Molalla City Manager Dan Huff said. “So we become this island that is surrounded by water, and you can’t get out.”\n\nFor families who got in, Preschool For All changed everything\n\nHuff said crews are closely monitoring water intake and wastewater systems, which can quickly clog with debris in fast-moving water.\n\nThe Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office is urging people to avoid flooded roads, stay clear of downed power lines, never drive through standing water, and treat dark traffic signals as four-way stops.\n\nMeanwhile, in Southwest Beaverton, neighbors told KOIN 6 News they’ve seen the consequences of people trying to drive through roads with standing water.\n\n“Two days ago, somebody got stuck coming through and they tried to make it, and there was an electric car and they had to tow it away. So it’s not very, not very wise to go through something you can’t see,” said Mike Bailey. “There’s a ditch on both sides and I’ve seen people come around. They don’t know that there’s a ditch there and they just flop right into it. So we pulled pulled a couple people out of there.”\n\nIn Detroit, Oregon, Marion County officials are warning people to be aware of crews that might be parked on the side of the road amid the heavy rain and low visibility. Crews are currently responding to hundreds of trees that came down in the area.\n\nOfficials say this round of heavy rain is raising red flags. With no snowpack to slow it down, all that water is heading straight into local rivers.\n\nStay with KOIN 6 News as this story develops.",

    "fullText": "AI promises to have far-reaching effects in music-making. While some welcome it as a compositional tool, many have deep concerns. Here are some of your responses\n\nAI-generated music is flooding streaming platforms, and it seems to be here to stay. Last month, three AI songs reached the highest spots on Spotify and Billboard charts. Jorja Smith’s label has called for her to receive a share of royalties from a song thought to have trained its original AI-generated vocals on her catalogue, which were later re-recorded by a human singer.\n\nWith this in mind, we asked for your thoughts on music composed by AI, the use of AI as a tool in the creation of music, and what should be done to protect musicians. Here are some of your responses.\n\nI have already found AI songs being added into jazz playlists and “radio stations” on Spotify. There was one song I actually liked, so I did some digging and found out it was a group with a generic name that had around three to five albums all released in 2025. Then I noticed the next track and the track followed the same path. It was really irksome. History, I hope, shows that people do value human flaws in art. Sometimes it helps us feel seen or not alone. I don’t understand how a completely computer-generated sound based on what’s come before could do that. Then again, some people fall in love with LLMs. I just think everything should be labelled somehow. Give people the choice. Make sure there are protections in place like forcing social feeds and music platforms to give consumers the ability to filter out AI-generated content. Casey, 37, Chicago, US\n\nThere’s no heart in music generated entirely by AI, and encouraging it is hurting the livelihoods of musicians. It is also very important not to call music made by AI “composed”. That word gives AI prompters far more credit and muddies the waters as to what composition is. The only people served by AI music are companies like Spotify, and major record labels who would no doubt rather not have to pay artists at all.\n\nAs for working with AI, I once recorded an album with my band and lost the stem tracks before we finished the final mix, but we were able to use an AI tool that could isolate certain instruments in the masters and boost them to get the mix we wanted. That seems to me an example of positive AI usage, and something that wouldn’t have been possible before AI. A composer like Ben Nobuto is also an example of someone who has used AI as a starting point for building real, human music. It’s probably too late now, but all musicians with work on streaming sites should probably have been paid as their work was likely used as training data. Additionally, musicians should be able to opt out of their work being used to train LLMs just like cookies on a website. Jon, 30, musician and music teacher, Switzerland\n\nI believe music needs a human component to be of any value. Music composed by AI has, from what I have heard, a big problem with simplistic or visible lyrics and a lack of emotional content.\n\nBut I am happy with musicians using AI as a tool. It brings professional quality recordings to those unable to hire a studio, orchestra or vocalist and so on. I have been writing songs for decades – in the 80s I couldn’t afford a Portastudio (four-track cassette recorder), so I used two single-track machines instead to play and record simultaneously. Now I can upload my songs to Suno (a generative AI program) and create new arrangements of them close to my original intention. It is great to be able to write for voices other than my own. Even so, some of my family and friends tell me they prefer my original versions. Mike Lee, 67, ex-photographer and teacher, Southampton\n\nAI-generated music is a copyright nightmare and is stopping creativity. We don’t have to accept it, and we don’t have to use it. The most irksome thing is non-creatives believing themselves to be artists, using AI to create and claiming it as their own art, when it’s an amalgamation of stolen work. Not sculpted with their own hands, not conceived in their own minds. Frankly, I find it embarrassing when someone proudly declares using it. Artists are already marginalised, but there is a kickback against, for example, TV slop, and a growing demand for audiences – in all forms – to not be treated like idiots. Artists are the answer to this, not AI.\n\nIf you can harness it to your advantage as an assistive tool, then by all means use it. The danger is to become reliant on AI. There should be a clear payment scheme, similar to PRS and PPL where AI shows exactly which items have been used to create. Or a watermark on copyrighted material. Nicole Vardon-Martin, 37, events and stage manager, Dagenham\n\nWhen social media and streaming services are flooded with digitally regurgitated stuff, it becomes harder to find the pieces with personal decisions behind them. I like knowing there’s a story behind the songs I get stuck in my head. I don’t think generative AI is the neutral tool many describe it to be, both because of its strain on the earth and because anything used by these algorithms has to come from somewhere, and keep coming, for what they chuck together to seem original.\n\nBlatantly copying someone else’s work doesn’t become “taking inspiration” because some software has mixed it around. Yes, there are musicians who use only their own work to generate “new” music, but in my opinion this is quite an insular and thoughtless way of creating. Generative AI will always, eventually, become bland without new content to sustain it, and more AI-generated work cannot fill that void. Charlotte, student, Cornwall\n\nIn my home studio I use AI to help mix and master music. I can see that it might be tempting to use an AI voice on your composition if you can’t sing – but why not go out to an open mic and see if you can find a real, living voice? Where would Burt Bacharach and Hal David be without all the brilliant singers who interpreted their songs? Who knows what a real musician will add to your music.\n\nI might be tempted to use AI to write a song but then I suspect my own musical abilities would atrophy and I would become quickly dependent on the technology. I don’t know enough about how copyright would work in these circumstances, but we need to protect human creativity and one way is to go out and see live music, commission people to write it, and to buy music directly from the artist if you can, avoiding those streaming services that pay very little and seem to be actively promoting fake artist profiles.

    "description": "Here’s the latest updates about the Enumclaw corridor.",
    "fullText": "A portion of Washington State Route 410 in Pierce County between Enumclaw and Greenwater will remain closed after flood damage resulted in part of the road falling into Boise Creek, the Washington State Department of Transportation confirmed Tuesday.\n\nThe closure is from Farman Street North at milepost 25 in Enumclaw to just west of Mud Mountain Dam Road at milepost 43 in Greenwater, said WSDOT communications manager RB McKeon in an email. The road first closed Dec. 11 following heavy rain. Given the widespread damage across multiple state highways and time needed to scope repairs, WSDOT could not provide a date when the road would fully reopen, she said.\n\nRivers in Pierce and King counties may continue to flood this week as another strong weather system is expected to arrive Tuesday night, as previously reported by The News Tribune.\n\nCrews have put up a temporary emergency lane on SR 410 to reduce weight on the damaged roadway, McKeon said. The lane will “allow limited, controlled access for emergency services and local traffic only, which is being convoyed via the Greenwater Fire Department at scheduled departures throughout the day,” she said.\n\nWSDOT has been working closely with partners in Greenwater, especially the Greenwater Fire Department, to help residents navigate the area while crews assess damage and restore immediate access while simultaneously planning for longer-term repairs, McKeon said.\n\nThe Enumclaw Police Department shared a photo on its Facebook page Monday showing parts of the eastbound lane at milepost 26.6 near Boise Creek collapsing into the water. McKeon said WSDOT is working to re-establish limited, single-lane access on the westbound lane with temporary traffic signals that will alternate eastbound and westbound traffic using one lane.\n\n“Crews moved quickly to construct the temporary lane, demonstrating the urgency of the response,” McKeon said. “However, returning the highway to its pre-storm condition will require additional time and a more comprehensive repair approach.”",
