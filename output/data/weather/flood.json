    "fullText": "Officers say flood of low-quality reports is draining resources and slowing cases amid New Mexico lawsuit\n\nMeta’s use of artificial intelligence software to moderate its social media platforms is generating large volumes of useless reports about cases of child sexual abuse, which are draining resources and hindering investigations, said officers from the US Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) taskforce.\n\n“We get a lot of tips from Meta that are just kind of junk,” Benjamin Zwiebel, a special agent with the ICAC taskforce in New Mexico, said last week during his testimony in the state’s trial against Meta. The state’s attorney general alleges the company’s platforms are putting profits over child safety. Meta disputes these allegations, citing changes it has introduced on its platforms, such as teen accounts with default protections. The ICAC taskforce is a nationwide network of law enforcement agencies coordinated with the US Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute online child exploitation and abuse cases.\n\nAnother ICAC officer, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters, said: “Meta is providing thousands of tips each month. It’s pretty overwhelming because we’re getting so many reports, but the quality of the reports is really lacking in terms of our ability to take serious action.” The ICAC officer added that the total number of cybertips their department had received doubled from 2024 to 2025.\n\nThe unviable tips from Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp, in some instances contain information that is not criminal, both Zweibel and two ICAC officers said. Tips sometimes contain information indicating a crime may have occurred, yet vital images, videos or text are missing or redacted, the anonymous officers added.\n\n“[Unviable tips from] Instagram have really skyrocketed recently, especially in the last couple of months, and that’s one of the biggest places where we’re seeing this information not being provided,” the ICAC officer added. “In those cases, we don’t have the information to further the investigation. It weighs on you to know that this crime occurred, but we can’t identify the perpetrator.”\n\nAsked about Zweibel’s testimony and the ICAC officers’ remarks, a Meta spokesperson said: “We’ve supported law enforcement to prosecute criminals for years: the DoJ has repeatedly praised our fast cooperation that has helped lead to arrests, and NCMEC has praised our streamlined and ‘improve[d]’ tip reporting process. In 2024, we received over 9,000 emergency requests from US authorities and resolved them within an average of 67 minutes – and even more quickly for cases involving child safety and suicide. Consistent with applicable law, we also report apparent child sexual exploitation imagery to NCMEC and support them to prioritize reports, from helping build their case management tool to labeling cybertips so they know which are urgent.”\n\nThe company pointed out that the agent, Zweibel, recommended the use of Meta’s teen accounts feature during his testimony, which he said he did “because it is the only option available, assuming that teens will not abstain from the use of social media”.\n\nRaúl Torrez, the New Mexico attorney general who is leading the case against Meta, has acknowledged the company’s cooperation in providing leads on child abuse at the trial: “I do want to credit some of the social media applications and platforms, including Meta, to a certain extent they do report images to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.”\n\nFilings released in the case on Friday show Meta executives sounding internal alarms over the company’s ability to police child sexual abuse and alert law enforcement in early 2019. At the time, the company was preparing to enable end-to-end encryption in Facebook Messenger, which hides users’ messages from anyone but the intended recipient via cryptography.\n\n“We are about to do a bad thing as a company. This is so irresponsible,” wrote Monika Bickert, Meta’s head of content policy.\n\nBickert wrote that there would be “no way to find the terror attack planning or child exploitation” if Messenger’s contents were encrypted, which could hinder working with law enforcement. Bickert also said Meta was making “gross misstatements of our ability to conduct safety operations”, according to the internal documents.\n\nIn another document, Meta employees estimated that encrypting Messenger would have rendered the company “unable to provide data proactively to law enforcement in 600 child exploitation cases, 1,454 sextortion cases, 152 terrorist cases, 9 threatened school shootings”.\n\nAndy Stone, a Meta spokesman, told Reuters: “The concerns raised in 2019 represent the very reason we developed a range of new safety features to help detect and prevent abuse, all designed to work in encrypted chats.”\n\nChild safety groups criticized the encryption of Messenger, which eventually rolled out in 2023.\n\nMeta is by far the largest reporter to NCMEC. In its data report for 2024, NCMEC said Meta made 13.8m reports across Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp, out of 20.5m tips it received in total.\n\nNCMEC said that in 2024, more than 1m CyberTipline reports were linked to a specific US state, and those reports were made available to the ICAC taskforces around the country, as well as other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, for investigation.\n\nMeta and other social media companies use AI to detect and report suspicious material on their sites and employ human moderators to review some of the flagged content before sending it to law enforcement. The Guardian has previously reported that tips generated by AI that haven’t also been reviewed by a social media company employee often cannot be opened by a law enforcement officer without a warrant because of fourth amendment protections. This extra step also slows investigations of potential crimes, lawyers involved in such cases say.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said: “It’s unfortunate that court rulings have increased the burden on law enforcement by requiring search warrants to open identical copies of content we’ve already reviewed and reported. Our image-matching system finds copies of known child exploitation at a scale that would be impossible to do manually, and we work to detect new child exploitation content through technology, reports from our community, and investigations by our specialist child safety teams.”\n\nUnder the Report Act (Revising Existing Procedures On Reporting via Technology), which came into force in November 2024, online service providers must broaden and strengthen their reporting obligations by notifying NCMEC’s CyberTipline not only about child sexual abuse material but also about planned or imminent abuse, child sex trafficking and related exploitation; they must also preserve evidence for a longer period and face higher penalties if they knowingly fail to comply.\n\nSince the act passed, the number of unviable tips supplied by Meta has increased dramatically, which could be because the company is acting to ensure it is not falling foul of the law, two ICAC officers said. Many of these tips could not be construed as a crime, such as adolescent girls talking about which celebrity they find most attractive.\n\n“Based on my training and experience, it appears that they are being submitted through the use of AI, as these are common mistakes that an AI would make that a human observer would not,” Zwiebel said in court.\n\nIn contrast, Zwiebel’s department receives significantly fewer tips on legitimate cases of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) distribution from Meta than in previous years, he said.\n\nEvery tip that reaches an ICAC division must be reviewed, and the influx of unviable tips is taking time and resources away from investigating legitimate cases of child abuse, said two officers.\n\n“It is killing morale. We are drowning in tips and we want to get out there and do this work,” said one ICAC officer. “We don’t have the personnel to sustain that. There’s no way that we can keep up with the flood that’s coming in.”",

    "fullText": "Andrew Left thinks he sees a big mismatch between investor perception and reality when it comes to SanDisk stock.\n\nSanDisk has been on a tear, surging more than 1,200% in six months as the market eyes a shortage of memory capacity that's driving up pricing power for companies in the space. Yet, Left thinks the stock is highly overvalued, laying out in an X post why his firm, Citron Research, is shorting the shares.\n\nLeft has expressed skepticism that certain tech stocks can continue to rally, citing fellow AI standout Palantir as another example of an overhyped and overvalued name. He used a different company to illustrate the problem he sees with SanDisk, though.\n\n\"The market is pricing SanDisk like it's $NVDA,\" Left wrote. \n\"There's one problem: NVIDIA has a moat. SanDisk sells a commodity. We've seen this movie before 2008, 2012, 2018. It's never different this time. Memory is a cycle, and cycles peak.\"\n\nSanDisk, Left says, is particularly vulnerable to competition from Samsung, which he calls the \"800-pound gorilla\" that's been in the space for 30 years.\n\nLeft's post comes as markets reprice certain AI trades, with a brutal sell-off in recent weeks hammering many tech sectors.\n\nBut in his view, the bigger problem isn't new companies disrupting the space, but a bigger incumbent muscling into SanDisk's territory. Left thinks Samsung will ultimately flood the industry with lower-cost memory chips, leaving SanDisk unable to compete.\n\n\"They're not just the capacity gorilla anymore,\" Left said, of Samsung. \"They're going after SanDisk's best customers with cheaper, newer technology. And the only thing keeping supply tight right now? Samsung's temporary yield problems in another product line. \nThat bottleneck has an expiration date.\"\n\nWhen it reaches that inflection point, Left expects SanDisk stock to start trading at lower levels, though he has not specified a price target.\n\n\"Shorting [SNDK] is skating to where the puck is going,\" he wrote. \"By the time the cycle normalizes, this stock will already be much lower.\n\nLeft isn't the only finance pro who sees it as an effective short play. Former JPMorgan quant chief Marko Kolanovic posted on Monday that bets against memory chip stocks are likely to pay off, naming SanDisk as a specific example.",

    "title": "The art of the squeal: What we can learn from the flood of AI resignation letters",
    "description": "What we can learn from the flood of \"why I quit\" letters from researchers at Anthropic, OpenAI, and xAI.",
    "fullText": "Corporate resignations rarely make news, except at the highest levels. But in the last two years, a spate of X posts, Substack open letters, and public statements from prominent artificial intelligence researchers have created a new literary form — the AI resignation letter — with each addition becoming an event to be mined for meaning. Together, the canon of these letters — some of them apparently bound by non-disclosure agreements and other loyalties, legally compelled or not — tells us a lot about how some of the top people in AI see themselves and the trajectory of their industry. Overall, the image is bleak.\n\nThis past week brought several additions to the annals of \"Why I quit this incredibly valuable company working on bleeding-edge tech\" letters, including from researchers at xAI and an op-ed in The New York Times from a departing OpenAI researcher. Perhaps the most unusual was by Mrinank Sharma, who was put in charge of Anthropic's Safeguards Research Team a year ago, and who announced his departure from what is often considered the more safety-minded of the leading AI startups. He posted a 778-word letter on X that was at times romantic and brooding — he quoted the poets Rainer Maria Rilke and Mary Oliver. Opining on AI safety, his own experiences working on AI sycophancy and \"AI-assisted bioterrorism,\" and the \"poly-crisis\" consuming our society, the letter had three footnotes and some ominous, if vague, warnings.\n\n\"We appear to be approaching a threshold where our wisdom must grow in equal measure to our capacity to affect the world, lest we face the consequences,\" Sharma wrote. \"Throughout my time here, I've repeatedly seen how hard it is to truly let our values govern our actions.\"\n\nSharma noted that his final project at Anthropic was \"on understanding how Al assistants could make us less human or distort our humanity\" — a nod, perhaps, to the scourge of AI psychosis and other novel harms emerging from people overvaluing their relationships with chatbots. He said that he didn't know what he was going to do next, but expressed a desire to pursue \"a poetry degree and devote myself to the practice of courageous speech.\" The researcher ended by including the full text of \"The Way It Is\" by the poet William Stafford.\n\nIn the annals of AI resignations, Sharma's missive might be less dramatic than the boardroom coup that ousted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman for five days in November 2023. It's less troubling than some of the other end-of-days warnings published by AI safety researchers who quit their posts believing that their employers weren't doing enough to mitigate the potential harms of artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a smarter-than-human intelligence that AI companies are racing to build. (Some AI experts question whether AGI is even achievable or what it might mean.)\n\nBut Sharma's note captures the deep attachments that top AI researchers — who are extremely well-compensated and work together in small teams — feel to their work, their colleagues, and, often, their employers. It also exposes some of the tensions that we see cropping up again and again in these resignation announcements. At top AI labs, there's an intense competition for resources between research/safety teams and people working on consumer-facing AI products. (Few, if any, public resignations seem to come from people on the product side.) There are pressures to ship without proper testing, established safeguards, or knowing what might happen when a system goes rogue. And there's a deep sense of mission and purpose that can sometimes be upended by feelings of betrayal.\n\nMany of the people who have publicly quit AI companies work in safety and \"alignment,\" the field tasked with making sure that AI capabilities align with human needs and welfare. Many of them seem very optimistic about AI, and even AGI, but they worry that financial pressures are eating away at safeguards. Few seem to be giving up on the field entirely — except perhaps Sharma, the aspiring poet. Either they jump ship for another seven-, eight-, or nine-figure job at a competing AI startup, or they become civic-minded AI analysts and researchers at one of a growing number of AI think tanks.\n\nAll of them seem to be worried that either epic gains or epic disasters lie ahead. Announcing his departure from Anthropic to become OpenAI's Head of Preparedness earlier this month, Dylan Scandinaro wrote on LinkedIn, \"AI is advancing rapidly. The potential benefits are great — and so are the risks of extreme and even irrecoverable harm.\" Daniel Kokotajlo, who resigned from OpenAI, said that OpenAI's systems \"could be the best thing that has ever happened to humanity, but it could also be the worst if we don't proceed with care.\"\n\nRecently, xAI, where co-founder Elon Musk is notorious for tinkering with the proverbial dials of the Grok chatbot, has seen a half-dozen members of its founding team leave. But the locus of the AI resignation letter, as a kind of industry artifact, is the red-hot startup OpenAI, where major figures, including top executives and safety-minded researchers, have been leaving for the last two years. Some resigned; some were fired; some were described in the press as \"forced out\" over internal company disputes. Seven left in a short period in the first half of 2024.\n\nWith revenue paling compared to its massive and growing infrastructure costs, OpenAI recently announced that it would begin incorporating ads into ChatGPT. That caused researcher Zoë Hitzig to quit. This week, she published a resignation letter in the Times, warning about the potential implications of ads becoming part of the substrate of chatbot conversations. \"ChatGPT users have generated an archive of human candor that has no precedent, in part because people believed they were talking to something that had no ulterior agenda,\" she wrote. But, she warned, OpenAI seemed prepared to leverage that \"archive of human candor\" — much as Facebook had done — to target ads and undermine user autonomy. In the service of maximizing engagement, consumers might be manipulated — the classic sin of the modern internet.\n\nIf you think you are building a world-changing invention, you need to be able to trust your leadership. That's been a problem at OpenAI. On November 17, 2023, Altman was dramatically fired by the company's board because, it claimed, Altman was \"not consistently candid in his communications with the board.\" Less than a week later, he performed his own boardroom coup and was reinstated, before consolidating his power. The exodus proceeded from there.\n\nOn May 14, 2024, OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever announced his resignation. Sutskever was replaced as head of OpenAI's superalignment team by John Schulman, another company co-founder. A few months later, Schulman left OpenAI for Anthropic. Six months later, he announced his move to Thinking Machines Lab, an AI startup founded by former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati, who had replaced Altman as OpenAI's interim CEO during his brief firing.\n\nThe day after Sutskever left OpenAI, Jan Leike, who also helped head OpenAI's alignment work, announced on X that he had resigned. \"OpenAI is shouldering an enormous responsibility on behalf of all of humanity,\" Leike wrote, but the company's \"safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.\" He thought that \"OpenAI must become a safety-first AGI company.\" Less than two weeks later, Leike was hired by Anthropic. OpenAI and Antrhopic did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAt OpenAI, departing researchers have said that the experts concerned with alignment and safety have often been sidelined, pushed out, or scattered among other teams, leaving researchers with the sense that AI companies are sprinting to build an invention they won't be able to control. \"In short, neither OpenAI nor any other frontier lab is ready, and the world is also not ready\" for AGI, wrote Miles Brundage when he resigned from OpenAI's AGI readiness team in 2024. Yet he added that \"working at OpenAI is one of the most impactful things that most people could hope to do\" and did not directly criticize the company. Brundage now runs AVERI, an AI research institute.\n\nAcross the AI industry, the story is much the same. In public pronouncements, top researchers gently chastise or occasionally denounce their employers for pursuing a potentially apocalyptic invention while also emphasizing the necessity of doing that research. Sometimes they offer a \"cryptic warning\" that leaves AI watchers scratching their heads. A few do seem genuinely alarmed at what's happening. When OpenAI safety researcher Steven Adler left the company in January 2025, he wrote that he was \"pretty terrified by the pace of AI development\" and wondered if it would wipe out humanity.\n\nYet in the many AI resignation letters, there's little discussion of how AI is being used right now. Data center construction, resource consumption, mass surveillance, ICE deportations, weapons development, automation, labor disruption, the proliferation of slop, a crisis in education — these are the areas where many people see AI affecting their lives, sometimes for the worse, and the industry's pious resignees don't have much to say about it all. Their warnings about some disaster just beyond the horizon become fodder for the tech press — and de facto cover letters for their next industry job — while failing to reach the broader public.\n\n\"Tragedies happen; people get hurt or die; and you suffer and get old,\" wrote William Stafford in the poem that Mrinank Sharma shared. It's a terrible thing, especially the tones of passivity and inevitability — resignation, you might call it. It can feel as if no single act of protest is enough, or, as Stafford writes in the next line: \"Nothing you do can stop time's unfolding.\"\n\nJacob Silverman is a contributing writer for Business Insider.

    "description": "Researchers have long believed that a sudden, massive deluge filled a dry, salt-filled Mediterranean some 5 million years ago. Turns out that probably didn't happen, but there was still drama aplenty.",
    "fullText": "Researchers have long believed that a sudden, massive deluge filled a dry, salt-filled Mediterranean some 5 million years ago. Turns out that probably didn't happen, but there was still drama aplenty.\n\r02.09.2026\n\nOn October 6, 1970, the deep-sea drilling vessel Glomar Challenger returned to port in Lisbon, Portugal, bearing a cargo that would revise history. During its 54-day voyage, the Challenger had punched 28 holes into the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea. The recovered cores pointed toward a startling conclusion: About 6 million years ago, the sea had turned into a desert: a vast, barren, salt-filled bowl more than two kilometers deep. Half a million years after that, the Atlantic Ocean had burst through what is now the Strait of Gibraltar and unleashed the largest flood in history.\n\nKenneth Hsü, an oceanographer who was one of the two lead scientists on the Challenger expedition, imagined the scene vividly in the December 1972 issue of Scientific American:\n\n“Cascading at a rate of 10,000 cubic miles per year, the Gibraltar Falls would have been 100 times bigger than Victoria Falls and 1,000 times more so than Niagara.… What a spectacle it must have been for the African ape-men, if any were lured by the thunderous roar.”\n\nThe catastrophe story was a hit: David Attenborough filmed a documentary about it, and Gibraltar even issued a 5-pence stamp portraying the “3,000-metre waterfall.” The two hypotheses — first, that the Mediterranean Sea became landlocked during a half-million-year period known as the Messinian salinity crisis, and second, that it was restored by a cataclysmic deluge through the Strait of Gibraltar, dubbed the Zanclean flood — have been conventional wisdom among geologists for more than 50 years.\n\nHowever, fresh doubts have arisen recently about every part of this story, from the mega-desert to the mega-Niagara. Many geologists have argued for a much briefer desiccation followed by a far more gradual refilling of the Mediterranean. Some think that the Mediterranean never completely disconnected from the Atlantic at all. “The idea of a megaflood, and the data that supports it, are mostly flawed,” says Guillermo Booth Rea of the University of Granada in Spain.\n\nThe most startling recent twist is that the floodway, if there was one, may not have been anywhere near the present-day Strait of Gibraltar, which separates southern Spain from Morocco. For 50 years, new research suggests, we have been looking for signs of a megaflood in the wrong place.\n\nIn the present-day Mediterranean, about three times more water is lost every year to evaporation than is recaptured from rainfall and rivers. The Atlantic makes up for the difference, supplying a steady west-to-east current of seawater through the Strait of Gibraltar. As the sea’s water evaporates, the remaining water becomes saltier and denser and sinks to the bottom. The dense water then flows back out of the strait, east to west, underneath the less dense inbound water. This outflow prevents salt from accumulating in the Mediterranean.\n\nBut what would happen if the strait were constricted, or shut off entirely? Given the hugely negative budget of fresh water, “sea level” in the Mediterranean Sea would drop rapidly, by as much as a kilometer in 2,000 years. Such a scenario would have seemed like science fiction until the Glomar Challenger’s 1970 expedition.\n\nAt the first drill site, the Challenger’s drill bit jammed on a very hard layer 200 meters below the bottom of the sea. The next day, Hsü and his co-lead scientist, William Ryan of Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, found out why. “It brought up buckets full of gravel,” Ryan says.\n\nSeafloors don’t often contain beds of gravel, and when they do, it is usually continental rocks washed down from the adjacent land. But this gravel had marine fossils and rock, mixed with crystals of gypsum. Geologists call gypsum an “evaporite,” because in the present-day world it forms in evaporating shallow bodies of water — as in the Dead Sea, for example. The implication was startling. “When Ken held up the gypsum crystals, he turned to me and asked, ‘Do you think the Mediterranean dried out?’” Ryan remembers.\n\nThe same story was repeated at every stop. Ryan and Hsü found other evaporites like halite (sodium chloride, aka table salt). Oxygen isotopes in seashells embedded in the gravel suggested that these unlucky animals had lived in a brine from which 90 percent of the original water had evaporated. Hsü and Ryan also gathered evidence that the colliding of the African and Eurasian tectonic plates had lifted up the land on both ends of the Mediterranean Sea, closing its former connection with the Indian Ocean and narrowing the connection with the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe clinching piece of evidence came to light after the Challenger mission had ended. Other geologists discovered what appear to be buried ancient beds of several rivers that flow into the Mediterranean, particularly the Nile and the Rhône. It looked as if those rivers once emptied into the Mediterranean at least a kilometer below their present outlets — something that would be possible only if the sea level of the Mediterranean had been a kilometer below the global sea level at some point in the past.\n\nIn 1973, a meeting in Utrecht, Netherlands, established the desiccation model as the consensus theory. But a considerable amount of dissent has emerged in the last 20 years. “In the 1970s, the desiccation people won the debate,” says Wout Krijgsman of Utrecht University, “but there are several aspects it cannot really explain.”\n\nIn part, the dissent reflects an improved understanding of what was occurring on Earth and in the area 6 million years ago. Since 1973, the story told by rocks, core samples and seismic soundings — and, increasingly, by computer simulations — has become more detailed and more dynamic, with changing shorelines, land bridges and volcanoes, and repeated episodes of climate change.\n\nAlso, there were fundamental problems with the desiccation hypothesis to begin with. Take the evaporites, for example: They do not have to form via evaporation, says sedimentologist and stratigrapher Vinicio Manzi of the University of Parma in Italy. They can also form by precipitation from a sufficiently concentrated brine. This can happen underwater, so there is no need to posit that the Mediterranean went bone dry.\n\nAnd the buried riverbeds? Those, too, Manzi and his colleagues can explain: The sinking of briny water can produce downhill currents (“dense shelf water cascading,” in geology lingo) sufficiently strong to scour out a canyon.\n\nThe idea of a single evaporation event also faces a mathematical problem: The existing salt deposit is too big to be explained by a single evaporation event. It represents about 5 percent of the salt in the world’s oceans (and may have originally been 7 to 10 percent). To collect that much salt, the Mediterranean would have had to empty and refill about 10 times.\n\nIn fact, evidence from salt deposits in Sicily suggests something like that actually happened. There, gypsum beds alternate with shale beds that are rich in organic material and could have formed in periods when the gateway between the Atlantic and Mediterranean was open. There are 16 beds in all, with ages spaced about 23,000 years apart.\n\nThis periodicity is well known to geologists: It’s the time it takes for Earth’s axis (like a wobbly top) to trace one complete circle. And it correlates with changes in climate and ancient sea levels the world over. With the presumptive Gibraltar gateway being so shallow during this period, sea level fluctuations due to this “precessional cycle” could have repeatedly opened and closed the connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic.\n\nThat period of gypsum formation is now called Stage 1 of the salinity crisis. Stage 2 was a relatively brief 50,000-year period when (in the majority opinion) the gateway slammed entirely shut, the sea level in the Mediterranean plummeted, and huge deposits of halite (sodium chloride) precipitated out from the seawater. However, Manzi’s group strongly dissents, arguing that the Gibraltar gateway remained open, but shallowed to such an extent that the water flowed through it in one direction only — in but not out — resulting in a runaway buildup of salt.\n\nEven for adherents of the majority view, Stage 2 is not as simple as it seems. Data from chlorine isotopes suggest that the drawdown was not uniform. At its lowest point, in the western Mediterranean, sea level was 800 meters below its present level, while east of present-day Sicily it was at least twice as deep as that. If so, the east and west portions must have been separated by a land bridge. Indeed, there is evidence of African animals crossing over to Europe during this time.\n\nThe last 200,000 years of the salinity crisis, called Stage 3, have been the most puzzling of all. The halite stopped precipitating and there is evidence for a variety of sea levels in the Mediterranean during this time. Widespread fossils of a shrimp-like animal called an ostracod suggest that the waters became much less salty, so that the Mediterranean was a sea-sized lake (and indeed, this stage is sometimes called the Lago-Mare stage). But if the gateway to the Atlantic was still closed, then where did the fresher water come from?\n\nA 2025 paper by Daniel García-Castellanos of the Spanish National Research Council helps solve the puzzle. Using a computer to model erosion, he argues that the Mediterranean was gradually refilling during Stage 3. The ostracods provide a clue to the source. They originated from the area of the present-day Black and Caspian Seas, which back then were connected to each other, but not to the Mediterranean.\n\nWith the shores of the Mediterranean being so newly exposed and so steep, its edges would have rapidly eroded toward today’s Black Sea, which at that time was a much larger freshwater lake called the Paratethys. The first connection between them could have been established at this time. If so, the Mediterranean began to receive waters from rivers like the Volga, the Don and the Danube, which had previously been unavailable. The ostracods got a new home, and the Mediterranean got a vast new supply of water, which according to the computer simulation raised its surface to within 300 meters of its current level.\n\nAccording Krijgsman, this interpretation conveniently reconciles the conflicting evidence. “In the fight between a desiccated and full Mediterranean,” says Krijgsman, García-Castellanos’ paper does the job “if you want to sit in the middle and give everyone credit for their observations.”\n\nThe literature on the Messinian salinity crisis is voluminous, and yet one thing is curiously absent. There is surprisingly little direct evidence of the megaflood that supposedly ended the crisis. Hsü’s original Scientific American article devotes only half a page to it and adduces little in the way of evidence. Fifty years later, Ryan wrote a 100-page retrospective; only three pages are about the megaflood. Shouldn’t this extraordinary flood have left very clear scars?\n\nThe current evidence is ambiguous at best. Geologists have found submerged flood-like deposits off Malta — but that’s a long way from Gibraltar, the putative source of the flood. Also, if the Atlantic drained into a nearly empty Mediterranean basin, then sea levels around the world should have dropped by about nine meters — an anti-flood to pay for the Mediterranean flood. There is no sign that this happened, says García-Castellanos.\n\nA recent deep-sea drilling expedition to the Strait of Gibraltar turned up more questions than answers. In December 2023, the JOIDES Resolution — heir to the Glomar Challenger — revisited the Alboran Sea immediately to the east of the Strait of Gibraltar. If the strait is the door to the Mediterranean, then the Alboran Sea is the vestibule. Any megaflood that passed through the Strait of Gibraltar would have passed also through the Alboran basin. But Rachel Flecker of the University of Bristol, England, co-leader of the expedition, says they found no traces of the flood in the cores they collected.\n\nWhile still on board the ship, she wrote that the cores were “exquisitely laminated in a variety of colors. This incredibly fine lamination requires very quiet, low energy conditions.” Exactly the opposite of a megaflood. Final results have not been published yet, but Flecker reports also that they found no salt layer and no evidence that the salinity crisis had ever touched the Alboran Sea.\n\n“The connection between the Atlantic and Mediterranean before and during the Messinian salinity crisis wasn’t through Gibraltar,” she concludes.\n\nHow can this be? “A feature that you must take into account, and nearly nobody does, is that the present physiography of the Mediterranean is very different from the Messinian one,” says Booth Rea. “Large basins have opened since, like the Tyrrhenian; other regions have emerged, like Sicily.” One possibility, he suggested, is that the gateway was somewhere to the east, through a volcanic arc of islands that once connected Africa to the Balearic Islands. Other possibilities include channels through Spain or Morocco, which are above sea level now but were underwater as recently as 7 million years ago.\n\nRegardless of how it happened, this modern view of the story holds lessons: It emphasizes the power not of dramatic events but of small changes. “Salt giants” — that is, massive salt deposits like the one underneath the Mediterranean — have formed at other times in Earth’s history, when basins were trapped between two tectonic plates. Their effects on climate and biodiversity have likely been huge: In this event, 89 percent of exclusively Mediterranean marine species died out.\n\nAnd a slight shallowing of the Strait of Gibraltar (or whatever the true gateway was) might be all that was needed to trigger these vast changes. “In some sense, this is more terrifying,” says Manzi, because it shows that “you can reach extreme conditions without extreme events.”\n\nTAKE A DEEPER DIVE\r| Explore Related Scholarly Articles\n\nThe authors examine the pros and cons of various theories, and present their own contrarian viewpoint, about what happened during the period from 5.97 to 5.33 million years ago, when the Mediterranean Sea allegedly became a desert.",

    "fullText": "Devastating flooding forced the evacuation of around 143,000 people from their homes in the North African nation of Morocco after rounds of heavy rain that started in late January spilled over into the first week of February.\n\nNumerous weather alerts were still in place as of Thursday for the northern half of Morocco. The country's weather service, the General Directorate of Meteorology, had alerts in place for strong winds and thunderstorms that could bring additional heavy rain to the region.\n\nThe alertness levels that correspond to these alerts range from a significant risk where \"dangerous weather phenomena are expected\" to extreme risk, which means \"dangerous weather phenomena of exceptional intensity are expected,\" according to the weather service.\n\nMorocco's historic city of Ksar El-Kbir has been hit hard by this week's flooding.\n\n\"The population needs to comply with God's deed and leave today. We only have a handful of inhabitants remaining but they will need to leave,\" the chairman of Ksar El-Kbir's city council, Mohamed Simo, told Bloomberg on Wednesday. \"Water is coming in from every corner and rainfall is expected to reach 150 millimeters between afternoon and evening today. We are doing everything we can to prevent loss of life.\"\n\nKing Mohammed VI ordered Morocco's military to assist with rescue and relief operations. The Grand Palace is at risk of flooding from this week's rain. Floodwaters from the Loukkos River forced residents to evacuate in trucks and horse-drawn carriages in northern Morocco.\n\nThe Oued El-Makhazine Dam was built on the waters of the Loukkos River basin in the late 1960s after Ksar El-Kbir endured several floods, according to state television 2M. The dam is currently holding over 40% more water than its original design capacity.\n\nMorocco is addressing the impacts our warming world is having on the country. Morocco plans to phase out coal by 2040, investing $30 billion in infrastructure and retiring old plants. The shift to renewable energy could reduce pollution, improve public health, and strengthen the nation's economy.\n\nOur warming world is supercharging the water cycle, creating a dichotomy.\n\n\"Current climate models indicate that rising temperatures will intensify the Earth's water cycle, increasing evaporation,\" say NASA scientists. \"Increased evaporation will result in more frequent and intense storms, but will also contribute to drying over some land areas.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\n\"As a result, storm-affected areas are likely to experience increases in precipitation and increased risk of flooding, while areas located far away from storm tracks are likely to experience less precipitation and increased risk of drought.\"\n\nNorthern Africa is vulnerable to extremes at either end of the water cycle spectrum. While the northern part of the country is facing flooding today, officials were addressing a major drought in parts of the country late last year. Morocco's innovative floating solar installation shades reservoir water to save it from evaporation while producing electricity for nearby infrastructure. Experts call it a win-win for water conservation and clean energy amid worsening drought conditions.\n\n\"Precipitation has been decreasing and is projected to continue declining across the country, with marked changes beyond natural variability anticipated in all regions before 2050,\" concluded a World Bank Group climate risk profile of Morocco.\n\nIt added, \"Longer drought seasons and the expansion of desertification northward are expected. At the same time, extreme precipitation events are likely to occur more frequently, increasing the risks of floods and landslides especially when combined with overall drier conditions.\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

They need new markets for their products as the country ramps up production in many industries. Exports to Latin America, a market of more than 600 million people, and other regions have climbed while exports to the U.S. fell by 20% last year.\n\n“Latin America has a solid middle class, relatively high purchasing power and real demand,” said Margaret Myers, director of the Asia and Latin America program at the Inter-American Dialogue think tank in Washington. “Those conditions make it one of the easiest places for China to offload its excess industrial production.”\n\nThe influx of made-in-China cars, clothing, electronics and home furnishings has rankled countries trying to build their own globally competitive industries. Some, such as Mexico, Chile and Brazil, have raised tariffs or taken other measures to protect their local industries.\n\nCheap e-commerce goods gain market share\n\nCheap goods from China are welcome news for many Latin American consumers, but they’re a headache for local businesses.\n\nChinese e-commerce platforms, led by Temu and Shein, have accelerated that trend.\n\n“I use Temu all the time, whether to buy clothes or household items. The same things I would find in brand-name stores or shopping malls, I find on Temu at a much lower price,” said Chilean restaurant manager Lady Mogollon.\n\nTemu averaged 114 million monthly active users in Latin America in the first half of 2025, a 165% increase year-on-year from 2024, market intelligence company Sensor Tower estimates.

    "description": "Tartaria is full of mystery and even tied to a mud flood conspiracy. Learn what experts have to say about the lost Empire of Tartaria.",
    "fullText": "In 2019, many people watched in horror as black smoke poured out of Notre-Dame de Paris, the 12th-century Roman Catholic cathedral. An orange blaze spread across the roof, and it seemed the historic building might be lost.\n\nAfter the fire went out and experts assessed the water damage, some people may have felt comforted that a restoration plan was in place. But conspiracy theorists who believed in the Tartarian Empire felt otherwise.\n\nTo them, it was just another example of Tartarian architecture being demolished.\n\nOne confusing aspect of the Tartarian Empire conspiracy is that there was a place and people long referred to as Tartars living in Tartary.\n\nWestern Europeans and Russians used to refer to a region in Asia as Tartary. This area included Siberia and parts of central Asia, including Mongolia and stretching as far south as Afghanistan. By the 1800s, some Russians saw their country as the world power in the East and entitled to the land and its resources.\n\nThe word tartar meant barbarian. In the mid-1600s, Italian writer Martino Martini wrote De Bello Tartarico about his travels in China. His work was translated into other languages and helped vaguely apply the term to a wide region of people.\n\nAlthough Tartar or Tartary is rarely used to describe Central Asia or its people, Crimean Tartars refer to a specific ethnic group. Crimean Tartars have lived in Crimea since the 12th century but endured mass deportations starting in the 1700s. After the fall of the Soviet Union, some Crimean Tartars began migrating back to their ancestral homeland.\n\nPeople who believe in the Tartarian Empire contend it was once a sophisticated, worldwide civilization with impressive architecture. Because such an empire is not mentioned in history books, conspiracy theorists claim it has been intentionally erased.\n\nMost of the empire was supposedly lost in a series of mudslides, typically referred to as “mud floods.” Some buildings remained and still stand today. Famous landmarks, such as the U.S. Capitol Building (built in 1800), are claimed actually to be from the Tartarian Empire and to be thousands of years old.\n\nThe conspiracy is that the empire was intentionally erased, and history was rewritten to make buildings seem younger and more modern.\n\nNotre-Dame de Paris is one landmark that conspiracy theorists believe was created by Tartars, not French craftsmen in the 1100s. In online forums, conspiracy theorists have claimed it was used as a sound bath by Tartars.\n\nConspiracy theories also claim more ornate buildings as Tartarian. This ranges from World Heritage Sites like the Taj Mahal to short-lived buildings like the Chicago Federal Building that only stood for 60 years.\n\nThe conspiracy theorists also claim buildings briefly constructed for World Fairs or expositions were part of the Tartarian Empire. In 1915, San Francisco hosted the Panama-Pacific International Exposition. The fair site included The Tower of Jewels, a temporary structure that was demolished soon after the fair ended. Conspiracy theorists claim it’s an example of an ancient Tartarian capital.\n\nThe Tartarian Empire conspiracy theory is relatively new, particularly when compared to UFO conspiracy theories that date to the 1950s. Interest has increased in the last decade, and believers use social media to share their ideas.\n\nCommunication scholars are analyzing how conspiracy theorists interact online and articulate their ideas. They’ve found that by sharing misinformation online, conspiracy theorists bond with each other and develop a sense of belonging.\n\nWhen conspiracy theorists discussed the fire at Notre-Dame de Paris, for example, believers in the Tartarian Empire shared affirmations as to why they knew the cathedral had once belonged to the Tartars. They pointed out features that indicated the cathedral was designed as a sound bath.\n\nThe supposed lost Tartarian Empire might seem like a benign analysis of architecture, but scholars also see concern in the fact that as a conspiracy theory, the empire was an elite, worldwide civilization that was destroyed and then systematically erased.\n\nOur writers at Discovermagazine.com use peer-reviewed studies and high-quality sources for our articles, and our editors review for scientific accuracy and editorial standards.

    "fullText": "Lack of verified information and rapidly advanced AI tools make it difficult to separate fact from fiction on US attack\n\nMinutes after Donald Trump announced a “large-scale strike” against Venezuela early on Saturday morning, false and misleading AI-generated images began flooding social media. There were fake photos of Nicolás Maduro being escorted off a plane by US law enforcement agents, images of jubilant Venezuelans pouring into the streets of Caracas and videos of missiles raining down on the city – all fake.\n\nThe fabricated content intermixed with real videos and photos of US aircraft flying over the Venezuelan capital and explosions lighting up the dark sky. A lack of verified information about the raid coupled with AI tools’ rapidly advancing capabilities made discerning fact from fiction about the incursion on Caracas difficult.\n\nVince Lago, the mayor of Coral Gables, Florida, posted the fake photo of Maduro being escorted by the DEA agents to Instagram, saying that the Venezuelan president “is the leader of a narco-terrorist organization threatening our country”. Lago’s post received more than 1500 likes and is still up as of this writing.\n\nTools for detecting manipulated content, such as reverse image search and AI-detection sites, can help assess whether online images are accurate, but they are inconsistent. Sofia Rubinson, a senior editor who studies misinformation and conspiracy theories for NewsGuard, told the Guardian that the fake images of Caracas are similar to actual events, which makes it even more difficult to figure out what is real.\n\n“Many of the AI-generated and out-of-context visuals that are currently flooding social media do not drastically distort the facts on the ground,” Rubinson said. “Still, the use of AI-generated fabrications and dramatic, out-of-context footage is being used to fill gaps in real-time reporting and represents another tactic in the misinformation wars – and one that is harder for fact checkers to expose because the visuals often approximate reality.”\n\nNewsGuard released a report on Monday afternoon that identified five fabricated and out-of-context photos as well as two videos of the military operation in Venezuela. One AI-generated photo shows a soldier posing next to Maduro, who has a black hood over his head. An out-of-context video shows a US special forces helicopter descending on a supposed Venezuelan military site – the actual footage was taken in June at the Fort Bragg army base in North Carolina.\n\nNewsGuard said the seven misleading photos and videos it identified have now garnered more than 14m views on X alone.\n\nOther footage from past events is also being circulated online and passed off as part of Saturday’s strike. Laura Loomer, a far-right influencer and Trump confidant, posted footage of a poster of the Venezuelan president on X saying that “the people of Venezuela are ripping down posters of Maduro”. According to Wired, the footage is from 2024. Loomer has since removed the post.\n\nAnother rightwing influencer and conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones, posted an aerial video on X of thousands of people cheering in Caracas. “Millions of Venezuelans flooded the streets of Caracas and other major cities in celebration of the ouster of Communist dictator Nicholas Maduro,” Jones wrote. “Now we need to see the same type of energy here on the HomeFront!”\n\nThe video, which is still up, has reached more than 2.2m views. Comments on the post from Community Notes, X’s crowdsource moderation tool, say that the video is “at least 18 months old”. A reverse image search of the video shows that the footage is actually from a protest in Caracas after Maduro’s disputed presidential win in July 2024.\n\nGrok, the platform’s AI chatbot, also disputes the timeline of Jones’ video, saying: “Current sources show no such celebrations in Caracas today, but pro-Maduro gatherings instead.”\n\nMeta, X and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",

    "fullText": "CORTE MADERA, Calif. (AP) — Heavy rain and high tides believed to be the most severe in two decades caused flooding in parts of Northern California on Saturday, prompting road closures and rescues of people trapped in cars.\n\nRoadways through a 15-mile (24-kilometer) stretch from the Sausalito area to San Rafael were flooded after a downpour coincided with record-breaking “ King Tides,” Marin County Sheriff's Sgt. Michael Dobbins said.\n\nAuthorities were called to assist when cars got stuck in water as high as 3 and 4 feet (1.1 and 1.2 meters), Dobbins said.\n\n“There is a lot of water in the roadways,” Dobbins said, adding that the tides were reportedly the highest in more than two decades. “Along with heavy rains, it just created the perfect storm for flooding on the streets.”\n\nAuthorities in the affected communities, which are north of San Francisco, asked people to stay home until waters recede. Some people kayaked along swamped streets, while others waded through water above their knees.\n\nA flood warning was in place for the San Francisco area until 2 p.m. Saturday and an advisory until 2 p.m. Sunday, according to the National Weather Service, and repeated rounds of rain were expected throughout the state on Sunday and Monday.\n\nTo the south in Santa Barbara County, roads were closed due to flooding and a key highway was blocked near Goleta due to a series of mudslides. A man died after he was swept into a creek during the storm, the county sheriff’s office said.\n\nKing Tides occur when the sun, moon and Earth are in alignment and the moon is in its closest position to the Earth, creating a stronger gravitational pull.",

    "fullText": "In Marin County, flooding left motorists stranded and kayakers paddling Saturday in areas where bicyclists usually pedaled. In San Francisco, storm surge drenched onlookers on the Embarcadero and at Crissy Field.\n\nElsewhere, storm surge forced other road closures in Alameda County and as far as Pacifica and Half Moon Bay.\n\nCalifornia flood map:See real-time updates\n\nMore reading: Heavy snow blankets Sierra, beckoning skiers and challenging drivers\n\nJon Borges surveyed the flooded intersection by the Grand Gasoline gas station just off 101 at De Silva Island Drive in Mill Valley, and his friend's stranded Toyota pickup.\n\n\"I was not expecting that at all,\" he said, of the impacts of the weekend's king tides, which flooded many low-lying areas in Mill Valley, as well as in San Francisco's Embarcadero and elsewhere around the Bay Area.\n\nThe trifecta of a super moon, an incoming storm system's strong winds and heavy rains resulted in a high tide Saturday morning 2.5 feet higher than normal - the highest king tide since Feb. 6, 1998, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Roger Gass. Flooding was reported across the Bay Area in Marin County, Sonoma County, Alameda County, San Mateo County and San Francisco.\n\nThe tide peaked just after 10:30 a.m. Saturday, though its took hours for floodwaters to recede. San Francisco's record high tide was 2.8 feet on Jan. 27, 1998.\n\nThe high tides prompted a coastal flood advisory in effect through 2 p.m. Sunday for much of the Bay Area and Central Coast. The powerful king tides and gusty winds sent seawater into streets, parks and other low-lying areas.  Floodwaters 2 feet deep closed parts of Interstate 80 just west of the metering lights on Oakland's side of the Bay Bridge and forced closure of other roads in Corte Madera, plus numerous roads in Sonoma County.\n\nStorm surge sent sent high waves over coastal jetties in Pacifica and Half Moon Bay, and over the walkways at Pier 14 in San Francisco's Embarcadero, drenching onlookers.\n\nFlash floods also disrupted traffic in Southern California. Southbound Highway 101 in Gaviota (Santa Barbara County) was closed Saturday morning due to a mudslide and flooding covering all lanes.\n\nMill Valley was especially hard hit, with flooding stranding motorists and forcing the closure of intersections.\n\nBorges, 28, had received a call at about 10:30 a.m., as the king tide was peaking.\n\nHis friend tried to drive his Toyota pickup through the flooded intersection and gotten trapped until local firefighters helped extricate him.\n\nBorges lives on a houseboat in Sausalito and is used to king tides, he said, but neither he nor his friend had realized how bad the flooding would be at the intersection by the gas station.\n\n\"We're just waiting for the water to go down enough to get a tow truck,\" he said.\n\nAt Camino Alto and Miller Avenue, Mill Valley Department of Public Works employees blocked a flooded intersection.\n\n\"It's the first time I've ever seen it this nasty,\" said Mark Bartel, who started working for the department six months earlier.\n\nThe department had to close other roads for minor flooding two months earlier, but \"it was nothing like this,\" he said as he waved motorists into the parking lot of the adjoining Safeway.\n\nA few yards down the way, Jen Bennett, 53, and Marianne Kabir, 56, were walking to pick up their sons from basketball practice.\n\n\"You can't even get to the high school,\" Bennett said.\n\nEarlier in the day, she'd tried to go for a run, only to find her usual trails underwater.\n\nKabir looked on the bright side. All the flooding had brought out a bevy of birds.\n\n\"It's really gorgeous,\" she said.\n\nAt Equator Coffee, farther down Almonte Boulevard, baristas fielded calls from customers wondering whether they could get to the shop. Julia Pfahl, 36, was picking up a morning coffee and chatting with baristas. She'd had to leave home much earlier than usual to get to work at Proof Lab Surf Shop. When she'd arrived at work, she'd found the shop under 4 inches of water.\n\n\"It's the worst I've ever seen it,\" she said, chuckling. \"Everyone is in a panic, no one knows how to drive in it - I saw a car by the Holiday Inn (on nearby Shoreline Highway) with water up to its windows. Did you really think you could drive through that?\"\n\nMeteorologists said another period of minor coastal flooding was expected late Sunday morning, though it will not be as severe as Saturday's water levels.\n\nTide levels will be about half a foot lower than Saturday's flooding, meteorologists said. By Monday, the coastal flood advisories are expected to drop off.\n\nThis article originally published at ‘Worst I've ever seen it': Bay Area flooding closes roads, strands motorists.",

The mercury stood at a chilly 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14.4 degrees Celsius) at the 8 a.m. start of the parade.\n\nAcross the country, in New York City, hats and gloves were as necessary as noisemakers at the city's New Year's Eve ball drop, where temperatures near freezing appeared to be the coldest in 10 years.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people gather along the nearly six-mile (10-kilometer) route in Pasadena, where the two-hour parade kicked off. Millions more watch on national television. Organizers at the Pasadena Tournament of Roses, the group that organizes the parade ahead of the Rose Bowl college football game, said they made only small changes to accommodate the weather, such as the tops being up on convertibles carrying grand marshal Earvin “Magic” Johnson and other VIPs.\n\nRain forecasts for the Rose Parade, which had been dry for 20 years, grew all week. On Thursday, the National Weather Service issued a flood watch for all California counties and a coastal flood advisory through Sunday afternoon along much of the Pacific Coast near San Francisco.\n\nMeanwhile, residents in the areas hit hardest by last year's devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires were under evacuation warnings.\n\nIn New York City, the sun came out ahead of Mayor Zohran Mamdani's inaugural celebration, but other areas of the Northeast and Midwest were hit by an Alberta clipper storm and trailing Arctic front that brought snow squalls and high winds.\n\nConditions varied widely — from snow showers to heavier squalls — from Wisconsin through northern Illinois and Michigan and into northern New Jersey, southeastern New York and New England.\n\nAbout a quarter of flights were delayed out of both San Diego International Airport and Boston Logan, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware.",

    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO, Calif. (FOX5/KUSI) — Heavy rain soaking San Diego on New Year’s Day caused widespread flooding and prompted multiple water rescues across the county, as storm runoff overwhelmed roads and drainage systems and left drivers and pedestrians trapped in fast-moving water.\n\nSome of the most severe flooding was reported in Mission Valley, a low-lying area known for flooding during periods of sustained rain. Water remained pooled in parts of the neighborhood hours after the heaviest rainfall, underscoring how quickly conditions deteriorated.\n\nEmergency crews responded to numerous rescue calls throughout the day, including along Fashion Valley Road, where rising floodwaters stranded motorists. In one incident, firefighters rescued one adult and one child from a Jeep that became partially submerged as water levels rose rapidly.\n\nSan Diego Fire-Rescue officials said another rescue unfolded nearby at Camino de la Reina and Avenida del Rio, where a man became trapped underneath a bridge as floodwaters surged. Search-and-rescue teams deployed a raft to reach him and safely pulled him out before transporting him to a hospital for medical evaluation.\n\n“This is about as bad as I’ve seen it,” said Mission Valley resident Steven Shadpour, who noted that flooding has been a recurring issue in the area. “They told us when I bought the place that Mission Valley is lower elevation, so whenever it rains, it floods down here.”\n\nFire officials emphasized that many of the rescues were preventable and urged the public to avoid flooded roads.\n\nCrews also responded to other storm-related emergencies across the county, including a rescue at Lake Hodges, where a woman was swept by floodwaters and later rescued by helicopter.",

    "fullText": "Portions of North Gene Autry Trail, Indian Canyon Drive, East Vista Chino and Araby Drive remain closed Thursday, Jan. 1 due to flooding.\n\nSouth Araby Drive is closed between Anza Trail and Stagecoach Road due to flooding. North Indian Canyon Drive remains closed between Sunrise Parkway and Garnet Avenue at the wash, and East Vista Chino remains closed between Clubhouse View Drive and Carmela Drive in Palm Springs. The four road closures were reported between 9:30 p.m. New Year's Eve and 5:20 p.m. New Year's Day.\n\nSo, how much rain have we gotten so far?\n\nMore: Flooding shuts down road in Desert Hot Springs on New Year's Day\n\nPhilip Gonsalves, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in San Diego, urged motorists to exercise caution and avoid driving through low-water crossings during a conversation about rainfall totals.\n\nHe said Palm Springs recorded about 0.58 inches of rain in the past 12 hours. The city typically receives less than a tenth of an inch on any given day this time of year.\n\nMeteorologists track rainfall from Oct. 1 through Sept. 30, which captures the region's full rainy season. In total, since October, Palm Springs has received 2.34 inches of rain, exceeding the normal 1.11 inches for that period.\n\nWinter storms typically bring limited rain to desert areas because surrounding mountains block much of the moisture — a rain shadow effect. The low-pressure system, Gonsalves said, pulled in deep tropical moisture from farther south, with moisture extending high into the atmosphere, allowing rain to fall even in areas that are usually shielded by the mountains.\n\nShowers are expected to taper off by mid to late afternoon Thursday as rain moves northeast out of San Diego County. Light, isolated showers could linger overnight, but they are expected to be brief and scattered.\n\nThe added moisture, however, comes with trade-offs.\n\n\"Everything comes with advantages and disadvantages, right? From one perspective, it's a good thing, but it comes with risks,\" he said. \"And in Southern California, one of the risks is flooding.\"\n\nAs rain ushered in the new year across the Coachella Valley, it's the kind of start that invites a little puddle-jumping while it lasts.\n\n\"Well, isn't that true for most things?\" Gonsalves said.\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)\n\nJennifer Cortez covers education in the Coachella Valley.

    "fullText": "Instagram's top executive thinks AI has made the social media site's carefully curated grid a thing of the past.\n\nIn an end-of-year message posted on Threads, Instagram head Adam Mosseri said that the platform would have to evolve to cope with a coming flood of AI-generated content — and warned that the rise of AI had killed off Instagram's polished aesthetic.\n\n\"Unless you're under 25 and use Instagram, you probably think of the app as a feed of square photos. The aesthetic is polished: lots of make up, skin smoothing, high contrast photography, beautiful landscapes,\" wrote Mosseri on Wednesday.\n\n\"That feed is dead. People largely stopped sharing personal moments to feed years ago,\" the Meta executive said, adding that users now kept friends updated on their personal lives through unpolished \"shoe shots and unflattering candids\" shared via direct messages.\n\nMosseri said the growing ubiquity of AI images meant creators would have to embrace this trend, and shy away from curated grids and professional-style photography in favor of a \"more raw aesthetic.\"\n\n\"Flattering imagery is cheap to produce and boring to consume. People want content that feels real,\" he wrote, adding that social media feeds are starting to fill up with \"synthetic everything.\"\n\nSocial media platforms like Instagram are grappling with a flood of AI-generated content, with tools like Midjourney and Sora making it easy to produce images and videos of almost anything.\n\nAt the same time, Meta has raced to integrate AI tools into Instagram and Facebook. Instagram rolled out an AI studio last year that lets users create custom chatbots, including digital versions of themselves, and has previously experimented with AI Instagram influencers based on real celebrities.\n\nMosseri said social platforms will get worse at identifying AI-generated media over time as the technology improves, adding that one solution could be for camera companies to cryptographically sign photos when they are taken to prove they are real.\n\nThe former Facebook executive said Instagram needed to label AI-generated content clearly, provide more transparency about who is posting on the platform, and build better creative controls so human users could compete with content made entirely by AI.\n\n\"For most of my life I could safely assume that the vast majority of photographs or videos that I see are largely accurate captures of moments that happened in real life. This is clearly no longer the case,\" Mosseri wrote.",

    "title": "I cover side hustles and started my own in 2025. Here's the best business advice I heard all year.",
    "description": "Among the flood of advice I've received, read, and reported on in 2025, here's what stuck with me the most.",
    "fullText": "There's an overwhelming amount of business advice out there.\n\nI hear a lot of it, by nature of my reporting and asking successful entrepreneurs what they wished they'd done differently, or what they'd tell prospective founders. Ever since starting my own business selling pickleball paddles — inspired by the plethora of Amazon sellers I interview — I hear even more (often unsolicited) advice. Everyone has something to say.\n\nAmong the flood of advice I've received, read, and reported on in 2025, here's what stuck with me the most.\n\nI know it sounds clichéd to \"follow your passion,\" but if you're starting a business — especially as a side hustle — you don't want it to feel like work. You don't want it to feel like a pesky chore, because it's what you'll be doing at the end of your workday on a Wednesday night, or at the start of your weekend on a Saturday morning.\n\nEven when you're not dedicating time to the business, it has a way of seeping into your shower thoughts or preventing you from falling asleep at night. If something is going to take up so much space, it might as well be something you care about.\n\nMy business partner and I weren't always going to sell pickleball paddles. That idea came from a conversation with a top Amazon seller, whom we consulted in the ideation stage. He encouraged us to think about our interests and how we generally spend our time. \"What do you like? What are you good at?\" he asked us. \"Start there.\"\n\nAs former collegiate tennis players, it seemed obvious that we should incorporate racket sports in our e-commerce business — and I'm so glad we did, because if we were selling kitchen utensils or candles or something we didn't know anything about or care much for, I doubt we'd still be plugging away after a year of learning lessons and lackluster sales. But we are. We believe in our product, and we're having fun trying to move inventory. Rather than feeling burned out, we feel energized.\n\nFigure out what you want, identify someone who already has it, and ask them — politely — for a bit of their time. Then, ask questions. Get curious. This is good, general life and business advice that frequently comes up in interviews with people across all industries. I never tire of it.\n\nWhy try to do everything on your own when you can potentially learn from someone else's mistakes and fast-track your path to success?\n\nIn addition to seeking out mentors, put yourself in the same room — virtual or physical — as people with similar goals. I've heard it over and over again: Who you hang around matters.\n\n\"Networking event\" or \"conference\" doesn't sound particularly fun or exciting, especially to an introvert. Despite reporting on the benefits of attending such events, I had never bought in — until earlier this year, when I spent 10 hours at a conference for real estate investors pursuing financial independence.\n\nI wrote about what it was like being in a room with hundreds of like-minded investors, describing it as \"powerful,\" and mentioning three main takeaways:\n\nOne, you learn — from people who are more successful than you.\n\nTwo, you connect — with people who could become your business partner, mentor, or client.\n\nThree, you gain momentum — perhaps just enough to inspire a key pivot, or take your first step into business, or simply keep the fire burning.\n\nI love an underdog story. Who doesn't? I appreciate grit, and I also believe the underrated, chip-on-your-shoulder mindset can be an asset. Just look at Stephen Curry, who was largely overlooked at the college level before blossoming into an NBA MVP.\n\nOr, to keep things more relevant, consider Kyle Ray. He's a college dropout I spoke with earlier this year who turned his window cleaning side hustle into a six-figure business that services hundreds of clients across Texas.\n\nHe told me that he didn't do great in school and, from a young age, his teachers tried to convince him that \"the best you can hope for is to be a manager of a restaurant.\" Rather than capitulating, he used their declaration as fuel. \"That's just been an internal driver, like, 'I'm going to prove this person wrong.'\"\n\nPeople will tell you that your idea is bad or that it won't work. \"The pickleball space is too competitive,\" one naysayer told me. \"I wouldn't want to be in your shoes!\" said another.\n\nRather than letting unproductive feedback discourage you, use it as motivation. It's fun being an underdog with something to prove. It's also really difficult. Underdog status or not, building a profitable, lasting business takes time, effort, and perhaps even a stroke of luck or two. It's often a series of many small steps over the course of many months and years that lead to success worthy of a feature in a news publication.\n\nI'm hyper-aware that for every successful entrepreneur I interview, there are 100 who have failed. But I'm also aware that you won't have a chance if you don't at least try.",

    "fullText": "WRIGHTWOOD, Calif. (AP) — A strong storm system that brought relentless winds, rain and snowfall to California this week was expected to ease Friday, but there was still a risk of high surf along the coast, flash flooding near Los Angeles and avalanches in the Sierra Nevada.\n\nWaves near the San Francisco Bay Area could reach up to 25 feet (7.6 meters) Friday, parts of Southern California were at risk of flooding, and avalanches could hit the Lake Tahoe area, officials warned. Residents were told to be ready to evacuate the mountain town of Wrightwood about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northeast of Los Angeles because of mudslides.\n\nAtmospheric rivers carried massive plumes of moisture from the tropics during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year. The storms were blamed for at least two deaths earlier in the week.\n\nThe system brought the wettest Christmas season to downtown Los Angeles in 54 years, the National Weather Service said.\n\nRoads in the 5,000-resident town of Wrightwood were covered in rocks, debris and thick mud on Thursday. With power out, a gas station and coffee shop running on generators were serving as hubs for residents and visitors.\n\n“It’s really a crazy Christmas,” said Jill Jenkins, who was spending the holiday with her 13-year-old grandson, Hunter Lopiccolo.\n\nLopiccolo said the family almost evacuated the previous day, when water washed away a chunk of their backyard. But they decided to stay and still celebrated the holiday. Lopiccolo got a new snowboard and e-bike.\n\n“We just played card games all night with candles and flashlights,” he said.\n\nDavey Schneider hiked a mile and a half (1.6 kilometers) through rain and floodwater up to his shins from his Wrightwood residence Wednesday to rescue cats from his grandfather’s house.\n\n“I wanted to help them out because I wasn’t confident that they were going to live,” Schneider said Thursday. “Fortunately, they all lived. They’re all okay — just a little bit scared.”\n\nArlene Corte said roads in town turned into rivers, but her house was not damaged.\n\n“It could be a whole lot worse,” she said. “We’re here talking.”\n\nWith more rain on the way, more than 150 firefighters were stationed in the area, said San Bernardino County Fire spokesman Shawn Millerick.\n\n“We’re ready,” he said. “It’s all hands on deck at this point.”\n\nA falling tree killed a San Diego man Wednesday, news outlets reported. Farther north, a Sacramento sheriff’s deputy died in what appeared to be a weather-related crash.\n\nAreas along the coast, including Malibu, were under a flood watch until Friday afternoon, and wind and flood advisories were issued for much of the Sacramento Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nSouthern California typically gets half an inch to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 centimeters) of rain this time of year, but this week many areas could see between 4 and 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters), with even \n\nMore wind and heavy snow was expected in the Sierra Nevada, where gusts created “near white-out conditions” and made mountain pass travel treacherous.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom declared emergencies in six counties to allow state assistance.\n\nThe state deployed resources and first responders to several coastal and Southern California counties, and the California National Guard was on standby.",

Two more deaths occurred in South Sacramento and San Diego, CNN reported.\n\nThe storms are affecting the entire state, from San Francisco to Los Angeles.\n\nThe storms began on Christmas Eve, with the Weather Prediction Center warning that a \"dangerous scenario\" was on the way.\n\nPer CNN, 15 million people were still in the moderate-risk zone for flooding on Christmas Day.\n\nThe airport saw 3 inches of rainfall on the 24th.\n\nAccording to CNN, emergency crews were pulling people from flooded cars and homes, and some people even had to be rescued from their roofs via helicopter.\n\nSarah Bailey, a resident of the Wrightwood area for two decades, told the Times this was the worst flooding she'd seen.\n\nChristopher Prater, a spokesman for the San Bernardino County Fire Department, told the outlet they'd received \"dozens\" of rescue calls on Wednesday night.\n\nA Pineapple Express is an atmospheric river, a band of concentrated water vapor.

    "description": "In a war with China, Taiwan could have an asymmetric advantage with a high volume of cheap and survivable weapons, a retired admiral said.",
    "fullText": "To prepare for a possible all-out war with China, Taiwan should focus on fielding substantial numbers of cheap, mobile, and survivable weapons, a former top Taiwanese defense official said.\n\nTaiwan currently faces two types of conflict — what experts and officials have referred to as China's gray-zone activities that are just below the threshold of war and the potential for a full-scale Chinese invasion. Countering both requires an array of weaponry.\n\nAt a Hudson Institute think tank event earlier this month, retired admiral and former chief of the general staff for Taiwan's defense ministry Lee Hsi-Min said Taiwan needed to prioritize the existential threat of a Chinese invasion. Gray-zone actions, such as frequent aircraft incursions, strain resources and stress assets and troops. The other could be catastrophic, as war games have shown.\n\n\"We need a large number of the distributed, mobile, survivable, lethal\" weapons, Lee argued, and those systems need to be low-cost, high-volume, and highly survivable in a fight, he added.\n\nAsymmetric warfare is a strategy that uses large numbers of inexpensive, mobile, hard-to-target systems — like drones, missiles, and dispersed units — to blunt a larger military's advantages by denying it easy targets and inflicting outsized damage. Think drones blowing up tanks in Ukraine or sinking Russian warships.\n\nLee argues that Taiwan's survival in a war against China depends on exactly this kind of strategy.\n\nTaiwan has aggressively pursued a strategy focused on weapons that fit these bills, including various types of drones, sensors, jamming, and anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles. Broader elements of increased investments in asymmetric warfare plans include how the civilian population of Taiwan is trained for a potential Chinese invasion and how the Taiwanese military would use urban warfare to hold off Chinese forces.\n\nThis doesn't mean conventional platforms and high-end weapons aren't valuable, Lee said, especially for helping Taiwan deter the everyday activities the Chinese military engages in, such as aggressive actions in the air and sea and massive exercises regularly held nearby. However, \"we need scalable\" and \"smart enough\" weapons, he said.\n\n\"If we are conducting the protracted war, sometimes the quantity means quality,\" Lee said. \"If we only have a kind of a small number of the advanced, sophisticated platform, I think we will have a big problem if China decided to attack Taiwan.\"\n\nSimilar lessons are being learned from the war in Ukraine. Soldiers, veterans, and drone makers have all said that a limited arsenal of exquisite systems isn't the right fit for a long war. The need is large volumes of cheap weapons. In warfare, sustainability is key. Overengineering and overspending simply aren't sustainable in a high-end fight.\n\nLee previously argued for asymmetric warfare and more mobile, uncrewed weapons and systems rather than buying more conventional weaponry like fighter jets and tanks in his \"Overall Defense Concept.\"\n\nIn 2020, he wrote in an article for The Diplomat that the idea is based on the premise that China will continue to see claiming Taiwan as a national and existential priority and Beijing will keep pouring money and resources into its military, which is vastly out-scaling Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan's government budgets for defense have increased substantially in recent years, and it continues to buy missiles, air defense systems, and drones from the US and other allies and partners.\n\nBut given the significant disparity between China and Taiwan's militaries and capabilities, \"Taiwan must abandon notions of a traditional war of attrition with the PLA [People’s Liberation Army],\" Lee and co-author Eric Lee, then a researcher at the Project 2049 Institute, wrote.\n\nTaiwan faces a substantially stronger adversary, and thus \"embracing an effective asymmetric defense posture and incorporating tactical asymmetric capabilities could compensate for Taiwan's disadvantage on paper and prevent the PLA from getting boots on the ground,\" they argued.\n\nAt the moment, Taiwan is leaning on a mix of capabilities. This month, the US announced its largest-ever weapons sale to Taiwan, at $11 billion. It includes High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, Army Tactical Missile Systems, Javelin missiles, howitzers, and drones.\n\nTaiwan's defense ministry said the weapons help bolster its self-defense and deterrence capabilities. China's foreign ministry said the sale violated agreements between Beijing and Washington and risked military confrontation with Taiwan.\n\nAn important piece of Taiwan's asymmetric strategy is rapid investment in domestic drone production, informed by lessons from Ukraine and collaborations with US and European firms. Taipei aims to produce 200,000 drones annually by 2030 and is investing billions into other defense systems, including a new air-defense network known as T-Dome.",

    "fullText": "PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) – Clackamas County is facing a triple threat Thursday night as flood warnings impact at least three different rivers and major creeks.\n\nMolalla officials say the city could soon find itself cut off if those rivers — Clackamas River, Pudding River, and Johnson Creek — rise any higher.\n\nLIVE Updates: Atmospheric river hits Oregon, SW Washington, bringing intense rain, wind\n\nThe National Weather Service predicts that Johnson Creek will rise above flood stage at Sycamore Thursday afternoon, and the Clackamas River near Estacada is expected to reach major flood stage later in the night.\n\nBut for the city, impacts are already stacking up.\n\nUtility crews have been working along Hwy 213 between Molalla and Oregon City, repairing downed power lines after trees toppled in strong winds.\n\nPortland General Electric has reported widespread outages across Clackamas County with some residents going into day two without power. Conditions have prompted the Molalla River School District to cancel class Thursday as city officials call on residents to prepare for this next round of water.\n\n“If the Molalla River and some of those other rivers actually do reach flood stage, we kind of become isolated,” Molalla City Manager Dan Huff said. “So we become this island that is surrounded by water, and you can’t get out.”\n\nFor families who got in, Preschool For All changed everything\n\nHuff said crews are closely monitoring water intake and wastewater systems, which can quickly clog with debris in fast-moving water.\n\nThe Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office is urging people to avoid flooded roads, stay clear of downed power lines, never drive through standing water, and treat dark traffic signals as four-way stops.\n\nMeanwhile, in Southwest Beaverton, neighbors told KOIN 6 News they’ve seen the consequences of people trying to drive through roads with standing water.\n\n“Two days ago, somebody got stuck coming through and they tried to make it, and there was an electric car and they had to tow it away. So it’s not very, not very wise to go through something you can’t see,” said Mike Bailey. “There’s a ditch on both sides and I’ve seen people come around. They don’t know that there’s a ditch there and they just flop right into it. So we pulled pulled a couple people out of there.”\n\nIn Detroit, Oregon, Marion County officials are warning people to be aware of crews that might be parked on the side of the road amid the heavy rain and low visibility. Crews are currently responding to hundreds of trees that came down in the area.\n\nOfficials say this round of heavy rain is raising red flags. With no snowpack to slow it down, all that water is heading straight into local rivers.\n\nStay with KOIN 6 News as this story develops.",

    "fullText": "AI promises to have far-reaching effects in music-making. While some welcome it as a compositional tool, many have deep concerns. Here are some of your responses\n\nAI-generated music is flooding streaming platforms, and it seems to be here to stay. Last month, three AI songs reached the highest spots on Spotify and Billboard charts. Jorja Smith’s label has called for her to receive a share of royalties from a song thought to have trained its original AI-generated vocals on her catalogue, which were later re-recorded by a human singer.\n\nWith this in mind, we asked for your thoughts on music composed by AI, the use of AI as a tool in the creation of music, and what should be done to protect musicians. Here are some of your responses.\n\nI have already found AI songs being added into jazz playlists and “radio stations” on Spotify. There was one song I actually liked, so I did some digging and found out it was a group with a generic name that had around three to five albums all released in 2025. Then I noticed the next track and the track followed the same path. It was really irksome. History, I hope, shows that people do value human flaws in art. Sometimes it helps us feel seen or not alone. I don’t understand how a completely computer-generated sound based on what’s come before could do that. Then again, some people fall in love with LLMs. I just think everything should be labelled somehow. Give people the choice. Make sure there are protections in place like forcing social feeds and music platforms to give consumers the ability to filter out AI-generated content. Casey, 37, Chicago, US\n\nThere’s no heart in music generated entirely by AI, and encouraging it is hurting the livelihoods of musicians. It is also very important not to call music made by AI “composed”. That word gives AI prompters far more credit and muddies the waters as to what composition is. The only people served by AI music are companies like Spotify, and major record labels who would no doubt rather not have to pay artists at all.\n\nAs for working with AI, I once recorded an album with my band and lost the stem tracks before we finished the final mix, but we were able to use an AI tool that could isolate certain instruments in the masters and boost them to get the mix we wanted. That seems to me an example of positive AI usage, and something that wouldn’t have been possible before AI. A composer like Ben Nobuto is also an example of someone who has used AI as a starting point for building real, human music. It’s probably too late now, but all musicians with work on streaming sites should probably have been paid as their work was likely used as training data. Additionally, musicians should be able to opt out of their work being used to train LLMs just like cookies on a website. Jon, 30, musician and music teacher, Switzerland\n\nI believe music needs a human component to be of any value. Music composed by AI has, from what I have heard, a big problem with simplistic or visible lyrics and a lack of emotional content.\n\nBut I am happy with musicians using AI as a tool. It brings professional quality recordings to those unable to hire a studio, orchestra or vocalist and so on. I have been writing songs for decades – in the 80s I couldn’t afford a Portastudio (four-track cassette recorder), so I used two single-track machines instead to play and record simultaneously. Now I can upload my songs to Suno (a generative AI program) and create new arrangements of them close to my original intention. It is great to be able to write for voices other than my own. Even so, some of my family and friends tell me they prefer my original versions. Mike Lee, 67, ex-photographer and teacher, Southampton\n\nAI-generated music is a copyright nightmare and is stopping creativity. We don’t have to accept it, and we don’t have to use it. The most irksome thing is non-creatives believing themselves to be artists, using AI to create and claiming it as their own art, when it’s an amalgamation of stolen work. Not sculpted with their own hands, not conceived in their own minds. Frankly, I find it embarrassing when someone proudly declares using it. Artists are already marginalised, but there is a kickback against, for example, TV slop, and a growing demand for audiences – in all forms – to not be treated like idiots. Artists are the answer to this, not AI.\n\nIf you can harness it to your advantage as an assistive tool, then by all means use it. The danger is to become reliant on AI. There should be a clear payment scheme, similar to PRS and PPL where AI shows exactly which items have been used to create. Or a watermark on copyrighted material. Nicole Vardon-Martin, 37, events and stage manager, Dagenham\n\nWhen social media and streaming services are flooded with digitally regurgitated stuff, it becomes harder to find the pieces with personal decisions behind them. I like knowing there’s a story behind the songs I get stuck in my head. I don’t think generative AI is the neutral tool many describe it to be, both because of its strain on the earth and because anything used by these algorithms has to come from somewhere, and keep coming, for what they chuck together to seem original.\n\nBlatantly copying someone else’s work doesn’t become “taking inspiration” because some software has mixed it around. Yes, there are musicians who use only their own work to generate “new” music, but in my opinion this is quite an insular and thoughtless way of creating. Generative AI will always, eventually, become bland without new content to sustain it, and more AI-generated work cannot fill that void. Charlotte, student, Cornwall\n\nIn my home studio I use AI to help mix and master music. I can see that it might be tempting to use an AI voice on your composition if you can’t sing – but why not go out to an open mic and see if you can find a real, living voice? Where would Burt Bacharach and Hal David be without all the brilliant singers who interpreted their songs? Who knows what a real musician will add to your music.\n\nI might be tempted to use AI to write a song but then I suspect my own musical abilities would atrophy and I would become quickly dependent on the technology. I don’t know enough about how copyright would work in these circumstances, but we need to protect human creativity and one way is to go out and see live music, commission people to write it, and to buy music directly from the artist if you can, avoiding those streaming services that pay very little and seem to be actively promoting fake artist profiles.

    "description": "Here’s the latest updates about the Enumclaw corridor.",
    "fullText": "A portion of Washington State Route 410 in Pierce County between Enumclaw and Greenwater will remain closed after flood damage resulted in part of the road falling into Boise Creek, the Washington State Department of Transportation confirmed Tuesday.\n\nThe closure is from Farman Street North at milepost 25 in Enumclaw to just west of Mud Mountain Dam Road at milepost 43 in Greenwater, said WSDOT communications manager RB McKeon in an email. The road first closed Dec. 11 following heavy rain. Given the widespread damage across multiple state highways and time needed to scope repairs, WSDOT could not provide a date when the road would fully reopen, she said.\n\nRivers in Pierce and King counties may continue to flood this week as another strong weather system is expected to arrive Tuesday night, as previously reported by The News Tribune.\n\nCrews have put up a temporary emergency lane on SR 410 to reduce weight on the damaged roadway, McKeon said. The lane will “allow limited, controlled access for emergency services and local traffic only, which is being convoyed via the Greenwater Fire Department at scheduled departures throughout the day,” she said.\n\nWSDOT has been working closely with partners in Greenwater, especially the Greenwater Fire Department, to help residents navigate the area while crews assess damage and restore immediate access while simultaneously planning for longer-term repairs, McKeon said.\n\nThe Enumclaw Police Department shared a photo on its Facebook page Monday showing parts of the eastbound lane at milepost 26.6 near Boise Creek collapsing into the water. McKeon said WSDOT is working to re-establish limited, single-lane access on the westbound lane with temporary traffic signals that will alternate eastbound and westbound traffic using one lane.\n\n“Crews moved quickly to construct the temporary lane, demonstrating the urgency of the response,” McKeon said. “However, returning the highway to its pre-storm condition will require additional time and a more comprehensive repair approach.”",
