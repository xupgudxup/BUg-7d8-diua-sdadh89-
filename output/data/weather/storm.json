    "title": "Airlines are canceling flights ahead of a winter storm. Here's what to do if your flight is delayed or canceled.",
    "description": "As a snow storm heads toward the New York City area, airlines are delaying and canceling thousands of flights.",
    "fullText": "A winter storm expected to hit the Northeast is causing thousands of flight delays and cancellations.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued a winter storm warning for areas around New York City, extending into Connecticut and New Jersey. The service expects heavy snow accumulations between six and nine inches.\n\nAbout 1,400 flights in the US have been canceled, as of 2:20 p.m. ET, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware. Over 5,100 US flights have been delayed, per the service.\n\nAffected travel hubs, including New York's John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia, and Newark Liberty airports, have begun issuing weather warnings.\n\nSome airlines have begun offering solutions to travelers affected by the storm. JetBlue, Delta, and Southwest have all waived fare differences for those changing flights from airports around the New York metropolitan area.\n\nThe delays and cancellations come during a high-density travel period around the winter holiday. AAA projected that 8.03 million Americans would fly domestically between December 20 and January 1.\n\nHere is the best advice for what to do if your flight is disrupted.\n\nAccording to the Department of Transportation, there is no law requiring US airlines to compensate passengers for disruptions caused by uncontrollable events, such as weather. That also includes air traffic control delays.\n\nThe only rule carriers must follow is to refund customers in the event of cancellations, even for non-controllable events. And that does not mean travel credits or vouchers — it must be cash, and includes any add-ons, such as bags or seats.\n\nBut carriers do not owe meals, hotel rooms, or financial compensation for storm-related cancellations or delays — because the cause is the weather, not the airline.\n\nPassengers are still entitled to a refund or rebooking on the same airline, but carriers are not required to provide additional accommodations or rebook on another airline.\n\nIf you choose to travel but your flight is delayed or canceled, ask the airline for the reason — ideally in writing — so you know what you're entitled to. Airlines have different policies for disruptions they control, like crew or maintenance issues.\n\nThe DoT's Airline Customer Service Dashboard — launched in 2022 — shows what the 10 largest US airlines promise in those cases, including rebookings, meal vouchers, and hotel accommodations.\n\nWhen a flight delay or cancellation is announced, expect people to flock to the nearest customer service line for assistance, and for the phone lines to clog.\n\nWait times can be painfully long, and the best alternatives will likely go quickly. However, some airlines offer the option to rebook on their website or mobile app and waive any fees, making it sometimes easier to make changes online than in person.\n\nIf all available options are exhausted, have a plan B, such as waiting to speak with a live agent, contacting the airline through social media, or booking a hotel for the night.\n\nDirect messaging on Facebook or Twitter can actually serve as a virtual placeholder, and you may hear back via chat before speaking to a live agent.\n\nHere are the phone numbers for each airline:\n\nFor controllable delays or cancellations that result in a customer waiting at least three hours for a new flight or requiring an overnight stay, several airlines will offer meal or hotel vouchers.\n\nCarriers offering both are Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, and United Airlines, per the DoT dashboard.\n\nFrontier Airlines is the only carrier that does not offer accommodations in the event of an overnight delay or cancellation, but it will provide a meal voucher.\n\nFor US airlines not listed on the dashboard, or in cases where the disruption is uncontrollable (like because of a winter storm), or if the compensation is unclear, simply ask.\n\nIt never hurts to request a meal or hotel during flight disruptions, and you might get lucky with a goodwill gesture from the carrier.\n\nSeveral major banks offer credit cards that come with travel insurance, like Chase's Sapphire Reserve or American Express' Platinum Card. Both offer trip protection, meaning customers who purchased their flight with that specific card can reap the benefits.\n\nFor example, in the case of a major storm system, it's likely many passengers will end up stranded in random cities across the US.\n\nHowever, banks with travel insurance included can reimburse cardholders for unexpected expenses outside their control, including hotel, meal, and transportation costs.\n\nTravel insurance does not apply in all circumstances, like short delays, so be sure to check your policy before making a claim — but it also doesn't hurt to make the claim anyway, even if the answer is no.\n\nDuring the holidays, it's easy to lose sight of your purpose — seeing friends and family or simply getting away from home for a few days.\n\nHowever, delays and cancellations are inevitable. Don't spend all day sitting around waiting — give yourself a cut-off time. Once that moment passes, consider alternative means of getting to your destination, such as driving or taking a bus or train (which may also be covered by travel insurance).\n\nIf you are stuck in another city and have no other option but to stay in a hotel or wait at the airport, decide how you want to spend your time and make a plan.\n\nEditor's note: This article was originally published in 2023 and has been updated.",

    "fullText": "WRIGHTWOOD, Calif. (AP) — A strong storm system that brought relentless winds, rain and snowfall to California this week was expected to ease Friday, but there was still a risk of high surf along the coast, flash flooding near Los Angeles and avalanches in the Sierra Nevada.\n\nWaves near the San Francisco Bay Area could reach up to 25 feet (7.6 meters) Friday, parts of Southern California were at risk of flooding, and avalanches could hit the Lake Tahoe area, officials warned. Residents were told to be ready to evacuate the mountain town of Wrightwood about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northeast of Los Angeles because of mudslides.\n\nAtmospheric rivers carried massive plumes of moisture from the tropics during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year. The storms were blamed for at least two deaths earlier in the week.\n\nThe system brought the wettest Christmas season to downtown Los Angeles in 54 years, the National Weather Service said.\n\nRoads in the 5,000-resident town of Wrightwood were covered in rocks, debris and thick mud on Thursday. With power out, a gas station and coffee shop running on generators were serving as hubs for residents and visitors.\n\n“It’s really a crazy Christmas,” said Jill Jenkins, who was spending the holiday with her 13-year-old grandson, Hunter Lopiccolo.\n\nLopiccolo said the family almost evacuated the previous day, when water washed away a chunk of their backyard. But they decided to stay and still celebrated the holiday. Lopiccolo got a new snowboard and e-bike.\n\n“We just played card games all night with candles and flashlights,” he said.\n\nDavey Schneider hiked a mile and a half (1.6 kilometers) through rain and floodwater up to his shins from his Wrightwood residence Wednesday to rescue cats from his grandfather’s house.\n\n“I wanted to help them out because I wasn’t confident that they were going to live,” Schneider said Thursday. “Fortunately, they all lived. They’re all okay — just a little bit scared.”\n\nArlene Corte said roads in town turned into rivers, but her house was not damaged.\n\n“It could be a whole lot worse,” she said. “We’re here talking.”\n\nWith more rain on the way, more than 150 firefighters were stationed in the area, said San Bernardino County Fire spokesman Shawn Millerick.\n\n“We’re ready,” he said. “It’s all hands on deck at this point.”\n\nA falling tree killed a San Diego man Wednesday, news outlets reported. Farther north, a Sacramento sheriff’s deputy died in what appeared to be a weather-related crash.\n\nAreas along the coast, including Malibu, were under a flood watch until Friday afternoon, and wind and flood advisories were issued for much of the Sacramento Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nSouthern California typically gets half an inch to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 centimeters) of rain this time of year, but this week many areas could see between 4 and 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters), with even \n\nMore wind and heavy snow was expected in the Sierra Nevada, where gusts created “near white-out conditions” and made mountain pass travel treacherous.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom declared emergencies in six counties to allow state assistance.\n\nThe state deployed resources and first responders to several coastal and Southern California counties, and the California National Guard was on standby.",

In Philadelphia, you can expect a mix of sleet and freezing rain with some snow. South Jersey and Delaware will transition to rain at some point overnight Friday.\n\nThe Philly area will start seeing precipitation around 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. on Friday, again moving west to east. Then, models predict the storm will move offshore sometime between 10 a.m. and noon on Saturday.\n\nModels vary about potential snow totals. But in general, forecasters predict between one and two inches of snow in northern Delaware, 1.5–4 inches in the Philadelphia area, and higher snow totals the further north you travel.\n\nPhiladelphia, according to the National Weather Service, has a nearly 30% chance of seeing 4 inches of snow/sleet or more by Satuday morning, with those chances being as high as 63% just 30 miles north in Trenton.\n\nIn addition to snow, experts predict large ice accumulation overnight Friday into Saturday, making streets and sidewalks dangerously slippery.\n\nThe National Weather Service says that people \"should consider delaying all travel\" until after the winter storm is over.\n\n\"If travel is absolutely necessary, drive with extreme caution,\" the NWS said, recommending travelers bring safety kits and other supplies in the event that they get stranded.\n\nInformation in this story is from FOX 29 meteorologist Sue Serio and the National Weather Service.",

Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Shasta counties on Wednesday. Some areas had already received 4 to 8 inches of rain by Wednesday morning, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nAnother wave of the storm was expected to hit on Christmas Day, with flood and wind advisories for \"life-threatening\" storm conditions from the National Weather Service remaining in effect until Thursday afternoon.\n\nOver 163,000 homes and businesses across California were still without power on Christmas morning, according to poweroutage.us.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Redding Police Department reported one storm-related fatality in Northern California.

    "fullText": "It has already been an eventful winter when it comes to winter weather, and it sounds like some parts of the country are expected to get hit hard by some heavy snow and dangerous winds this week.\n\nOn the morning of Wednesday, Dec. 24, the National Weather Service (NWS) issued a series of \"urgent\" Winter Weather warnings for a few regions of the country, warning of incoming snow and wind over the next few hours and days.\n\nThe warnings are especially pertinent for those planning holiday ski trips or hiking trips in some mountain regions.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the NWS issued a winter weather warning for south central, southwest, and western Maine, as well as northern New Hampshire, predicting that those areas could get snowfall reaching up to 14 inches by Wednesday afternoon.\n\n“Periods of moderate and heavy snow will combine with low visibility to create dangerous driving conditions,” the NWS warned in its advisory. “The hazardous conditions could impact the Wednesday morning commute as well as holiday travel.”\n\nThe advisory goes through Wednesday at 1 p.m., and the NWS warns that this could impact holiday travel.\n\n\"If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency,\" the NWS warned.\n\nParts of California, especially those in high elevations in the Yosemite National Park region, are expected to see some heavy snowfall over the next few days, combined with some strong winds.\n\nThe NWS warns that some areas could get between 4 and 8 feet of snow and 60 mph winds, lasting until Friday night, which could cause \"whiteout conditions.\"\n\nOther areas, like the Greater Lake Tahoe area, could get up to two feet of snow (with up to five feet expected above 5,000 feet) and 50 mph winds. Winds up to 100 mph are likely along the top ridges until Friday morning.\n\n“The strong winds and weight of snow on tree limbs may down power lines and could cause sporadic power outages,” the NWS warned in its advisory. “Whiteout conditions are expected and will make travel treacherous and potentially life-threatening. Travel could be very difficult to impossible.”\n\nParts of Idaho are expected to see some heavy winter weather this week, especially those at higher elevations. The NWS warns of several feet of snow and wind gusts of up to 35 miles per hour in some areas of the state through Thursday.\n\n\"Heavy snow expected,\" the NWS wrote in its advisory. \"Total snow accumulations of around 5 inches to 1 foot at elevations 6500 feet to 8000 feet. Above 8000 feet expect 1 to 2 feet of snow. For highest peaks, up to 3 feet of snow is likely. For Galena Summit about 1 foot of snow is expected. Accumulations in Ketchum and Sun Valley will be much lower at 2 inches or less. Winds gusting as high as 35 MPH.\"\n\nObviously, this could make travel difficult during the holiday season.\n\n\"Travel could be very difficult to impossible, mainlyover Galena Summit and in backcountry areas. Expect blowing and drifting snow,\" the NWS warned.",

Road conditions are expected to be slippery, with even hazardous conditions affecting traffic, the NWS wrote in a probabilistic weather forecast.\n\n“New York is no stranger to snow and cold weather, and given the Christmas holidays, it’s important to be extra prepared before getting on the road,” Governor Hochul said. “As always, I urge New Yorkers to monitor their local forecast and text their county or borough name to our weather and emergency alerts system. Stay vigilant, drive slowly if you need to travel, and have a safe holiday weekend.”\n\nThose with travel commitments are encouraged to follow these safety tips.\n\nMonitor the forecast for the area you may be traveling to\n\nMake sure your car is stocked with survival gear like blankets, a shovel, a flashlight and extra batteries, extra warm clothing, a set of tire chains, battery booster cables, quick energy foods, and brightly colored cloth to use as a distress flag\n\nKeep your cell phone battery charged and keep it with you whenever traveling\n\nMatthew Euzarraga is a multimedia journalist from El Paso, Texas.

The release of the Nintendo Switch 2 saw the updated rerelease of Super Mario Party Jamboree along with it. This new title in the beloved digital board game series is packed with over 110 minigames and a roster of 22 characters, so there are more options for people to settle for after the no.1 character, Yoshi, is picked.\n\nRead our review of Super Mario Party Jamboree here\n\nWhen work is slowing down for the holidays, friends are home from school, and it's time to relax and let off some steam, Call of Duty Black Ops 7 is here for you. Whether you want to squad up with that same group you've been playing with since the old days or mowing down some zombies with your cousins or siblings, few games can offer quite the same cathartic gunplay as a new CoD game. And if you instead want to just check out a wild story, then hop into campaign mode, where you can play as Milo Ventimiglia, the actor behind Peter Petrelli from the mid-2000s superhero drama on NBC, Heroes.\n\nRead our review of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 here\n\nWith the cold weather settling in and snow coming down, sometimes it can be nice to settle in for a nice, long comfort RPG, and the new Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D Remake is perfect for those cold nights indoors. Following up on last year's Dragon Quest III Remake, DQ I&II are impressive and expansive retellings of the original games that came out nearly 40 years ago. With classic turn-based combat and a run time that can easily last 70+ hours, Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D pairs perfectly with a soft blanket and a mug of hot chocolate.\n\nRead our review of DQ I&II HD-2D Remake here\n\nFew games this year have garnered quite as much discussion and fervor as Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. If, for some reason, you haven't had a chance yet to play it, this holiday if you have some time off work or school, do yourself a favor and play this game. From its complex world, captivating characters, and an enthralling soundtrack, if you have friends or family who also play games, play this game; it will give you all plenty of things to talk about.\n\nRead our review of Expedition 33 here.\n\nI've never quite understood the idea of Sonic the Hedgehog driving a car when he could run faster than one, but when a game is as fun as Sonic Racing: Crossworld is, those thoughts flow out of my head. Crossworlds is the best classic cart racer this year with exciting tracks, neat vehicle transformations, and a ton of characters -now from worlds and properties outside of Sonic! Gather around your screen for some local split-screen shananigans or play online with 12 players at once for a truly chaotix time.\n\nRead our review of Sonic Racing: Crossworlds here\n\nIf you are looking for more of a cooperative jaunt, one of the best this year is Split Fiction, from Hazelight Studios, the same team behind the also fantastic It Takes Two. Split Fiction is a split-screen adventure where you and another person will work together through a variety of tricky challenges covering all sorts of game genres all under the umbrella of a wonderful tale of friendship. As an added bonus, only one person needs to own a copy of the game as you can invite another player to play with you online using the free Friend's Pass.\n\nRead our review of Split Fiction here.\n\nThere is something to be said about a game where you can play on the couch, losing hours to it, and Ball X Pit is a game that fits that bill. This clever twist on the classic brick-breaking formula is a rougelike indie game where you unlock new adventurers and descend into a pit to defeat menacing monsters by bouncing a wide variety of special spherical projectiles at them. In addition to being able to upgrade and fuse these powerful weapons, you will also unlock new characters to pick from, a small village-building system, and more as you break the walls of the encroaching enemies. Ball X Pit is a master at giving you that \"one more run\" itch.\n\nRead our review of Ball X Pit here\n\nIf you are \n\nRead our review of Blue Prince here\n\nWould you trust your best friends to help you climb a mountain? What about your family? Well, wonder no longer, as, thanks to indie developer Team Peak, you will now be able to do just that (in a safe, non-real-world scenario) with Peak. This cooperative climbing adventure puts you and your friends in a predicament that requires you to scale a tall mountain in order to survive. With cute visuals, proximity chat, climbing items to help you, and more, all helped push Peak to the top of Steam charts this year, and it is a great time to check out while on break this holiday.\n\nCheck out a bit of the history behind Peak here\n\nWhether it's Ultimate, Brawl, Melee, or any of the other variations, I have never attended a gathering that Super Smash Bros. hasn't improved. The chaos of 8-man multiplayer, the tense edge-of-your-seat sudden death matches, and the exultation of come-from-behind wins help keep Smash Brothers from ever getting old. While the world anxiously waits for the word of a Switch 2 Smash, the old versions are just as fun to revisit, so grab some controllers and prepare to fight!\n\nRead our review of Super Smash Bros.

    "fullText": "Before he ever worked in finance, Cardinez thought he'd play professional football. When that didn't happen, he found a way to remain close to the action — interning at Madison Square Garden, joining the 2014 Super Bowl host committee, and completing the NFL's rotational program across media, business development, and strategy.\n\nHe thought he'd stay there and ascend the ranks. But he decided on a different path that seemed to align more with his interests: finance.\n\nAfter earning his MBA and working in investment banking, he joined Blue Owl's HomeCourt Partners, a fund established with the NBA to buy minority stakes in teams.\n\nCardinez has since worked on multiple franchise deals, including the Phoenix Suns' $4 billion sale and a 2024 transaction involving the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nKress' path to high finance began in academic research, studying anthropology and psychology at Notre Dame and conducting fieldwork in Sierra Leone before pursuing graduate work on Angola's energy sector at the University of Oxford. She later worked at political research and consultancy firm, Eurasia Group, training investors to integrate geopolitical risk into decision-making.\n\nKress came to BlackRock first as an advisor to Tom Donilon, the former US national security advisor, a post she called a \"dream job.\" She helped Donilon elevate the firm's geopolitics function into a permanent part of the BlackRock Investment Institute.\n\nBut she didn't stop there. This year, Kress was named the chief of staff to Larry Fink, the firm's powerful CEO. She told Business Insider that this new job was the \"culmination\" of her career, offering \"unparalleled exposure\" to global policymakers and business leaders.\n\nJack Levendoski, JPMorgan Chase\n\nLevendoski grew up all over the world — from Louisiana to London, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Australia — before beginning his career as a facilities engineering project manager at Chevron.\n\nIn that role, he supported offshore oil and gas work in the Gulf of Mexico. Levendoski later moved into investment banking and is now an executive director in JPMorgan's M&A group, advising on high-profile technology and software transactions.\n\nMenasche admits he didn't always feel like a natural fit for the finance industry — he didn't grow up in a household of bankers, he said, and he studied chemistry and math at Cambridge. But after trying academic research, he found the lab's pace too slow. That realization led him to roles that blended analytical work with more day-to-day momentum, eventually steering him into secondaries.\n\nToday, Menasche is a managing director and global cohead of Goldman Sachs' private capital and liquidity solutions group, working across real estate, infrastructure, private equity, and venture capital transactions.\n\nJackie Shepherd, Morgan Stanley\n\nBefore joining the ranks of Wall Street, Shepherd spent years competing in Division I golf, earning a full-ride scholarship and captaining the University of Minnesota's team. She began her career in accounting at EY's international tax practice, where she first encountered investment banking.\n\n\"I didn't realize that there was an intersection between the two,\" she told Business Insider. \"I wanted to be the person coming up with more of the cool ideas.\" So she made the pivot to Wall Street.\n\nAfter holding roles at Goldman Sachs and Citi, she joined Morgan Stanley's separations and structured solutions group. Shepherd has worked on roughly $250 billion in transactions, including Comcast's pending carve-out of its cable networks.\n\nGolf, she said, remains a key part of her life, adding that aspires to play on all seven continents.",

Like a throwback to the good old days under Brendan Rodgers, Ange Postecoglou or even Martin O'Neill.\n\nWith 31 shots on goal, 10 on target and an xG (expected goals) of 4.5, Celtic should have been out of sight. The only thing for supporters to worry about should have been some last-minute Christmas shopping.\n\nBut when Kenan Bilalovic thudded his shot under Kasper Schmeichel to draw 10-man Aberdeen inexplicably level with 16 minutes to remaining, concerns were firmly focused on Nancy again.\n\nSince taking change from O'Neill less than three weeks ago, many fans will have wondered if he realised what he'd walked into.\n\nAnd while Nancy would be forgiven for failing to make sense of Sunday's ridiculous contest, he'll not be given so much leeway if the rays of light on show against Aberdeen don't turn into a full new dawn.",

    "description": "It's almost the end of 2025, and in the spirit of Spotify Wrapped, several big companies have invited subscribers to review their last year of activity. Sony got the ball rolling with the PlayStation Wrap-Up, Steam offers a similar annual roundup, and the Nintendo Switch Year in Review recap has been announced for early next year--but where is Xbox in the middle of all this?\nWhile it doesn't offer an Xbox wrap-up every year, it still feels odd for Microsoft's gaming brand to skip 2025. The year has seen several high-profile releases from the company and the launch of an Xbox-branded handheld gaming PC alongside Asus, but according to Windows Central, Microsoft is allocating its marketing budget toward celebrating several major anniversaries in 2026.\nThe Xbox brand celebrates its 25th anniversary next year, Blizzard has its 35th anniversary to look forward to, and Bethesda is turning 40.",

    "fullText": "Southern California is basking in sunshine and unseasonably warm temperatures this week, but forecasters say a holiday twist is on the way.\n\n“We’re still seeing fog for some coastal spots, but inland areas are warming up above average once again,” KTLA weather anchor Kacey Montoya said Monday, noting highs in the low 80s for the Los Angeles Basin. “It’s about 20 degrees above average today, even warmer tomorrow.”\n\nThe National Weather Service said highs will stay in the low 80s through Thursday before cooling into the 70s by the weekend. Air quality remains moderate for most of the region, with a mandatory wood-burning ban in effect through Tuesday for the South Coast Air Basin.\n\nThe NWS long-range forecast shows a Pacific storm could arrive as early as Dec. 22, with snow levels dropping in mountain communities – potentially complicating holiday travel.\n\n“There is a system that is very likely to bring us some widespread precipitation,” Montoya said. “Models don’t agree on when the rain begins or how much.”\n\nBut meteorologists caution that those hoping for a big boost to ski resorts may be disappointed.\n\n“Next week’s stormy pattern does not appear to be a big snowmaker for our area as the upper level trough will pull in moisture from the southwest initially, then a plume from the south joins in on the fun,” the Weather Service said in a bulletin. “Thus temperatures will remain too warm for any significant snow.”",

    "description": "The historic rally has carried over to the Toronto Stock Exchange, where the mining-heavy materials sector has led the index to record-breaking highs.",
    "fullText": "With many gold stocks cruising towards triple-digit gains in 2025, analysts say next year could be another period of blistering returns for companies mining the yellow metal.\n\nThe gold futures contract for February (GC=F) breached US$4,300 per ounce on Friday, a level not seen since October, when bullion hit an all-time high above US$4,350. This historic rally has carried over to the Toronto Stock Exchange, where the mining-heavy materials sector has led the index to record-breaking highs.\n\nAnalysts at RBC Capital Markets expect gold to average US$4,600 per ounce in 2026, ending the year at approximately US$4,800 per ounce. In 2027, their team, led by the bank’s head of global metals and mining research, sees bullion averaging US$5,100 per ounce.\n\n“Historically, gold producers have behaved pro-cyclically, resulting in sharply higher costs/capital, rising reserve assumptions, and increasing M&A in a rising price environment, which has ultimately eroded investor returns,” Josh Wolfson and his peers wrote in RBC’s latest global precious metals equities outlook.\n\n“Today, producers are operating with a significantly more prudent approach to capital allocation and discretionary spending, and we expect reserves to be calculated at a conservative <US$2,000/oz, less than 50 per cent of current gold prices,” Wolfson added. “Gold producers are experiencing a perfect storm, and are behaving responsibly.”\n\nThat said, RBC describes its outlook on gold stocks as “more conservative than consensus.” The bank expects capital spending to rise, as producers with extra cash look to squeeze returns from existing projects. They also see all-in sustaining costs, a key industry metric, rising by nine per cent in 2026.\n\nAmong the operators, Wolfson and his team say Canadian companies Agnico Eagle (AEM.TO)(AEM), Barrick Mining (ABX.TO)(B), and Kinross Gold (K.TO) have the most downside risk. On the other hand, RBC predicts shares of South Africa-based AngloGold Ashanti (AU) could see “modest upside,” versus its estimates.\n\nExchange-traded fund (ETF) provider Global X says its Gold Producers Index ETF (GLDX.TO) is the top-performing ETF in Canada year-to-date, excluding leveraged funds. The TSX-listed basket of stocks has gained nearly 178 per cent year-to-date. Barrick, AngloGold, and Kinross are its top three holdings.\n\n“Anytime something is up in the triple digits, I would say that probably exceeds expectations,” Chris McHaney, Global X’s head of investment management and strategy, told Yahoo Finance Canada.\n\n“You might see a similar type of return [in 2026]. With the gold price where it is, generally at all-time highs, the gold producers don’t really need the price of gold to continue going up. They just need it to stay relatively where it is, and they’ll be able to make significant cash flows from their operations.”",

    "fullText": "The National Weather Service has been busy over the past few weeks as extreme weather surges across the United States. Record warm temperatures along the West coast brought catastrophic flooding to the region while temperatures continue to plunge in the Midwest and Great Lakes regions as record cold and heavy snowfall dominate the area.\n\nEarlier this week the NWS issued a winter storm warning for several states, but played particular attention to Montana, which is expecting a surge in snowfall.\n\n“For the Winter Storm Warning, heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 6 and 12 inches, with localized amounts approaching 20 inches in the Island Ranges. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph,” the NWS said in a statement.\n\nThe heavy snowfall is expected to hit The Highwood, Little Belt, Judith, and Snowy Mountains, and Southern Rocky Mountain Front, though much of the middle part of the state is in danger of serious weather.\n\nAn interactive map from the National Weather Service shows the percentage change of a storm to exceed the initial warning criteria revealed for the area. Much of Montana sits in a very high probability range that weather will become much more serious than initially predicted, according to the model.\n\nAnother map from the NWS shows regions south of Lewistown, MT are expecting up to 24 inches of snow - or perhaps more as the scale tops out at 24 inches - through Sunday, Dec. 14.\n\nIn addition to a Winter Storm Warning, much of Montana received an Extreme Cold Warning as well, with temperatures dropping to more than 20 degrees below zero.",

    "title": "Winter storm watch issued for Columbus, central Ohio. See when snow will hit",
    "description": "Two winter systems are expected to bring several rounds of accumulating snow to central Ohio beginning tonight and continuing into the weekend.",
    "fullText": "Break out the shovels, your weekend's about to get snowy.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Wilmington has issued a winter storm watch for several central Ohio counties, including Franklin, Licking, Preble, Montgomery, Greene, Fayette, Pickaway, Fairfield and Hocking.\n\nThe advisory issued the afternoon of Dec. 11, which includes Columbus, goes into effect Saturday, Dec. 13 and runs until the morning of Sunday, Dec. 14.\n\nThe watch says that accumulation of 3 to 5 inches is possible and could make travel difficult in parts of east central Indiana and central and west central Ohio.\n\nThere is also a chance of snow overnight and into the early morning of Friday, Dec. 12, with the forecast calling for some snow after 4 a.m.\n\nTwo separate weather systems will bring accumulating snow. First, 2-4 inches of snowfall is expected tonight into Friday morning, with impacts to the morning commute. Next, 2-4 inches of additional accumulation is possible Saturday afternoon into Saturday night. pic.twitter.com/hMLxv7qMy0\n\n— NWS Wilmington OH (@NWSILN) December 11, 2025\n\nNWS alerted these weather conditions in an X post on Dec. 11, explaining \"two separate weather systems will bring accumulating snow.\"\n\nThe NWS says the overnight snow could affect the Dec. 12 morning commute. So, it might be a good idea to leave early for work or school to give yourself time to get to where you're going safely.\n\nThe previous considerable snowstorm snarled traffic, resulted in multiple crashes and led to several school closings and delays across central Ohio.\n\nThe Climate Prediction Center (CPC) confirmed on Dec. 11 that the La Niña weather pattern would continue to impact weather across the country until February 2026.\n\nIn Ohio, La Niña winters mean colder conditions, especially if you live in the northern and eastern parts of the state.\n\nThe strong westerly to northwesterly winds crossing Lake Erie can fuel lake-effect snow along the snowbelt, impacting cities such as Cleveland, Toledo, and Sandusky. If the lake remains ice-free later into the season, as is expected in milder falls, snow events can be more frequent and intense.\n\nSouthern Ohio may not see significant lake-effect snow, but the region can still experience colder-than-average temperatures and occasional heavy snowfall when Arctic air aligns with storm systems.For example, during past La Niña winters, northern Ohio has seen multiple lake-effect snowstorms dropping several feet of snow in just a few days, while southern Ohio experienced sharp cold snaps and scattered snow events — a pattern that reflects the classic La Niña influence on the state.\n\nLa Niña isn't the only weather system influencing winter weather. The polar vortex is expected to impact Ohio. Dipping Arctic air and frigid temperatures will hit the entire state, according to AccuWeather. Indiana and Kentucky will also be affected.\n\n\"There is a massive area of air in northwestern Canada where temperatures are 20 to 30 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, and it is on its way southeastward into the U.S.,\" AccuWeather Chief On-Air Meteorologist Bernie Rayno said. \"This is the mother lode of cold air and is a term I don't use lightly.\"Over the next few days, extreme cold air will barrel into the central and eastern U.S. \"like a wrecking ball,\" said Weather Trader meteorologist Ryan Maue in a post on X on Dec. 9, as reported by USA TODAY. Maue dubbed it a \"textbook 'Polar Vortex' mega-dump of western Canadian cold.\"\n\nThe cold blast could be relatively short-lived, however. Forecasts expect a return to more typical wintry temperatures as the polar vortex retreats back to the north.\n\nCurrently, no schools in the Columbus area have announced closures for Dec. 12. That could change before the morning, so continue monitoring the storms at dispatch.com.\n\nToday: A slight chance of snow showers before 11 a.m. Mostly cloudy, with a high near 32 degrees. There will be west wind 8 to 10 mph. There is a 20% chance of precipitation.\n\nTonight: A chance of snow, mainly after 2 a.m. Cloudy, with a low around 26 degrees. There will be west wind around 5 mph becoming calm in the evening. There is a 40% chance of precipitation. New snow accumulation of less than one inch possible.\n\nFriday, Dec. 12: A chance of snow, mainly after 7am. Mostly cloudy, with a high near 35. East wind 3 to 6 mph. Chance of precipitation is 50%.

    "fullText": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Rains drenched Gaza’s tent camps and dropping temperatures chilled Palestinians huddling inside them Thursday as winter storm Byron descended on the war-battered territory, showing how two months of a ceasefire have failed to sufficiently address the spiraling humanitarian crisis there.\n\nFamilies found their possessions and food supplies soaked inside their tents. Children’s sandaled feet disappeared under opaque brown water that flooded the camps, running knee deep in some places. Dirt roads turned to mud. Piles of garbage and sewage cascaded like waterfalls.\n\n“We have been drowned. I don’t have clothes to wear and we have no mattresses left,” said Um Salman Abu Qenas, a displaced mother in a Khan Younis tent camp. She said that her family couldn't sleep the night before, because of the water in the tent.\n\nAid groups say not enough shelter materials are getting into Gaza during the truce. Figures recently released by Israel's military suggest it hasn't met the ceasefire stipulation of allowing 600 trucks of aid into Gaza a day, though Israel disputes that finding.\n\n“Cold, overcrowded, and unsanitary environments heighten the risk of illness and infection,” the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said on X. “This suffering could be prevented by unhindered humanitarian aid, including medical support and proper shelter.\"\n\nSabreen Qudeeh, also in the Khan Younis camp, in a squalid area known as Muwasi, said that her family woke up to rain leaking from their tent's ceiling and water from the street soaking their mattresses.\n\n“My little daughters were screaming,” she said.\n\nAhmad Abu Taha, also living in the camp, said there wasn't a tent that escaped the flooding. “Conditions are very bad, we have old people, displaced, and sick people inside this camp,” he said.\n\nFloods in south-central Israel trapped more than a dozen people in their cars, according to Hebrew media. Israel's rescue services, MDA, said that two young girls were slightly injured when a tree fell on their school.\n\nThe contrasting scenes with Gaza made clear how profoundly the Israel-Hamas war had damaged the territory, destroying the majority of homes. Gaza’s population of around 2 million is almost entirely displaced, and most people live in vast tent camps stretching along the coast, or set up among the shells of damaged buildings without adequate flooding infrastructure and with cesspits dug near tents as toilets.\n\nAt least three buildings in Gaza City already damaged by Israeli bombardment during the war partially collapsed under the rain, Palestinian Civil Defense said. It warned people not to stay inside damaged buildings, saying they too could fall down on top of them.\n\nThe agency also said that since the storm began, they have received more than 2,500 distress calls from people across Gaza whose tents and shelters were damaged.\n\nWith buckets and mops, Palestinians laboriously scooped water out of their tents.\n\nAliaa Bahtiti said her 8-year-old son \"was soaked overnight, and in the morning he had turned blue, sleeping on water.” Her tent floor had an inch of water on it “We cannot buy food, covers, towels, or sheets to sleep on.”\n\nBaraka Bhar was caring for her 3-month-old twins inside her tent as the rain poured outside. One of the twins has hydrocephalus, a build-up of fluids in the brain.\n\n“Our tents are worn out ... and they leak rain water,” she said. “We should not lose our children this winter.”\n\nAid groups say that Israel isn't allowing enough aid into Gaza to begin rebuilding the territory after years of war.\n\nUnder the agreement, Israel agreed to comply with aid stipulations from an earlier January truce, which specified that it allow 600 trucks of aid each day into Gaza, It maintains it's doing so, but The Associated Press found that some of its own figures call that into question.\n\nThe January truce also specified that Israel let in a number of caravans and tents. No caravans have yet entered Gaza during the ceasefire, said Tania Hary, executive director of Gisha, an Israeli group advocating for Palestinians’ right to freedom of movement.\n\nThe Israeli military body in charge of coordinating aid to Gaza, called COGAT, said on Dec. 9 it had “lately\" let 260,000 tents and tarpaulins into Gaza and more than 1,500 trucks of blankets and warm clothing.\n\nShelter Cluster, an international coalition of aid providers led by the Norwegian Refugee Council, sets the number lower. It says the U.N. and international nongovernmental organizations have gotten 15,590 tents into Gaza since the truce began, and other countries have sent about 48,000. Many of the tents aren't properly insulated, it says.\n\nAmjad al-Shawa, Gaza chief of the Palestinian NGO Network, told Al Jazeera on Thursday that only a fraction of the 300,000 tents needed had entered Gaza. He said that Palestinians were in dire need of warmer winter clothes and accused Israel of blocking the entry of water pumps to help clear flooded shelters..\n\n\"All international sides should take the responsibility regarding conditions in Gaza,” he said. “There is real danger for people in Gaza at all levels.”\n\nKhaled Mashaal, a Hamas leader, said in an interview with Al Jazeera that Gaza needs the rehabilitation of hospitals, the entry of heavy machinery to remove rubble, and the opening of the Rafah crossing — which remains closed after Israel said last week it would shortly open.\n\nCOGAT didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the claims that Israel wasn’t allowing water pumps or heavy machinery into Gaza\n\nAmnesty accuses Hamas of crimes against humanity\n\nAmnesty International said in a report released Thursday that Hamas and other militant groups committed crimes against humanity in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel that triggered the war in Gaza.\n\nIn the 173-page report, Amnesty pointed to what it found to be widespread and systematic killing of civilians in the attack, as well as torture, hostage-taking and sexual abuse.\n\nIn the attack, Hamas fighters and other militants rampaged through southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking around 250 others hostage. Israel's campaign in Gaza has since killed more than 70,300 Palestinians, roughly half of them women and children, according to the territory’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and civilians in its count. Last year, Amnesty accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, a charge Israel denied.\n\nAmnesty said it conducted interviews with 70 people, including 17 survivors of the attack and family members of some of those killed. It also reviewed hundreds of open-source videos and photos from the day of the attack.\n\nContrary to Hamas claims it was targeting the military, it said, the attack was intentionally “directed against a civilian population” and met international law standards for crimes against humanity.\n\nIt said sexual assaults were also committed, though it said it could not reach a conclusion on their “scope or scale.” It interviewed one man who testified he was raped by armed men at the Nova music festival, as well as a therapist who said she provided intensive treatment to three other survivors of rape.\n\nHamas condemned the report, saying it “echoed false claims” by Israel.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister spokesperson Oren Marmorstein derided the report in a posting on X, saying it took more than two years for Amnesty to address the attack “and even now its report falls far short of reflecting the full scope of Hamas’s horrific atrocities.”",

    "fullText": "\"Ultimately, what matters is your own interpretation of the ending and of the story,\" Expedition 33 creative director Guillaume Broche told GameSpot.\n\n on December 10, 2025 at 10:53AM PST\n\nThe Game Awards are just around the corner, and while this time of year is surely exciting for all the nominees--and those of us eager for new game announcements--this year, there is one studio in particular that has more reason than any to celebrate: Sandfall Interactive.\n\nEarlier this year, the small-scale studio took the world by storm with its debut title, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Despite being Sandfall's first game, the narrative-driven, turn-based RPG quickly entered the pantheon of all-time greatest RPGs, earning nearly universal critical acclaim for its artistry, story, and espousal of mechanics and themes typically associated with Japanese RPGs.\n\nNow, Sandfall Interactive stands poised to make The Game Awards history. Last month, the studio broke The Game Awards' record for most award nominations, earning a whopping 13, including Game of the Year. Earlier this year, I spoke with the studio's creative director, Guillaume Broche, who said the team was in \"disbelief\" about how the game has been received; it stands to reason that this sentiment has only grown with the game's tremendous success.\n\nBroche also shared a bit of a behind-the-scenes look at the game's development, explaining how there were \"a lot of arguments\" about the game's ending, why the team opted for minimal user interface, and how many people are still unaware of the game's biggest inspiration.\n\nGameSpot: Firstly, I'd love to know: What is the atmosphere of the studio following the game's tremendous success?\n\nBroche: I think a lot of us are still in disbelief with how the game’s launched and how fans have embraced it. Every day we say to each other, \"Is this real?\" or, \"Can you believe that?\" when we see another milestone reached or that our favorite game developer or studio reached out and congratulated us. It's all really overwhelming in a way, and we’re super grateful for everyone for their faith and support.\n\nAs I played through Expedition 33, it felt to me like the team took a \"less is more\" approach to creating the game. There are few UI elements on the screen and oftentimes, the character's expressions and what they don't say are just as impactful as what they do. That said, I'd like to hear in your own words about your design philosophies and principles, if you could elaborate on them.\n\nWe always wanted to tell a story that felt realistic and grounded. Of course, we have fantasy elements in the story, but at its core it’s a fundamentally human story. And in that story we wanted to have subtle, realistic interactions and emotions--which is why there’s a certain \"less is more\" feeling, like you say. It just makes the game feel more \"real\" in our eyes, or at least easier to engage with and relate to. Not every interaction in real life is a perfectly written, theatrical conversation--sometimes it’s just a look, or subtle moments of quietness, that have the most impact.\n\nFor the UI, we also wanted to have that same grounded approach to exploration. We trust the player to find their way through our levels, to understand our systems, and to engage with the world in the way we intended. We took some inspirations from games we grew up with in that sense, avoiding bloating our game with systems and designs that ultimately don’t improve the main game experience.\n\nI've found that Clair Obscur is phenomenal in working within shades of grey and every character feels deeply human. As such, reflecting on the game's ethics and big decisions are both interesting and challenging. Do you believe there truly is a true or \"good\" ending to the game?\n\nThat’s something we've had a lot of arguments about in the team too! I think your reaction to the endings, and which one is the \"good\" ending, is super subjective and related to your own personal experiences in real life. And I think that’s a strength of our writing and story--kudos to our Lead Writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, and our amazing mocap and voice actors for their performances--sometimes there is no clear \"good\" or \"bad\" choice in life that everyone will be happy with, and living within the grey, and those complex choices, are what makes us real people. Ultimately, what matters is your own interpretation of the ending and of the story.\n\nMany sites have been quick to note Legend of Dragoon, the Final Fantasy series, and even From Software titles as games that Clair Obscur has seemingly drawn inspiration from, but are there any other works that inspired you that you want to talk about?\n\nActually, I didn’t play Legend of Dragoon before coming up with the QTEs (quick-time events) during skills. I learnt later that a game did something similar! There are also other inspirations like the Persona series, but also action games like Devil May Cry and Nier.\n\nOne major inspiration is a French novel called La Horde du Contrevent. It tells the story of a group of explorers--or an expedition--travelling across the world to find the source of the supernatural wind that sweeps across the world. Their tale, and the human stories of the team and their discoveries as they travel the world, were also an inspiration for us as we developed a story of our own expeditioners traveling across the world. I’d recommend that anyone who’s a fan of our story picks up this book, but I don’t think it’s been translated into English fully since it’s so densely written with so much nuance in the French language. So I guess maybe fans should learn French, and then read the novel!\n\nWhether Clair Obscur will break the record currently held by The Last of Us: Part II and take home more than seven awards from The Game Awards remains to be seen. However, with 13 nominations and a Game of the Year award on the line, it's certainly worth tuning in to see what happens. The Game Awards airs tomorrow, December 11, at 9:30 PM ET / 6:30 PM PT.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?
