The expansion marks the end of Diablo 4's ongoing story, culminating in an epic battle against the MMO-ARPG's biggest antagonist: Mephisto.\nRevealed as part of 2025's The Game Awards, Lord of Hatred sees players team up with an unlikely ally in an attempt to put an end to the Lord of Hatred's uprising. The expansion takes players to the fabled isles of Skovos, a region that was meant to appear in Diablo 3 before ultimately being cut, and serves as the former home of both Lilith and Inarius.",

    "fullText": "Passengers expecting a quick hop across the Irish Sea instead faced a flight to nowhere.\n\nRyanair Flight 555 departed Manchester, in northern England, on Tuesday afternoon and was supposed to land in Dublin about 40 minutes later.\n\nThe two cities are only about 160 miles apart, as the crow flies.\n\nHowever, as the Boeing 737 approached the Irish capital, it circled off the coast a few times before coming in for its first landing attempt.\n\nThe plane was unable to touch down and instead headed back out to sea, entering another holding pattern.\n\nStorm Bram caused widespread disruption in Ireland and the UK on Tuesday. Yellow wind warnings were in place across the whole of Ireland. At one point, wind gusts in Dublin reached 50 knots, or about 57 mph. Some 25,000 buildings in the country were left without power.\n\nTwo hours after leaving Manchester, the pilots made a second landing attempt but were again unable to bring the plane down.\n\nInstead, they decided to head back across the Irish Sea, diverting to Manchester.\n\n\"This flight from Manchester to Dublin (9 Dec) diverted back to Manchester due to high winds at Dublin Airport,\" Ryanair told Business Insider in a statement.\n\nThe plane landed there around 5:30 p.m. — nearly two and a half hours after it had taken off.\n\n\"Storm Bram is continuing to have a significant impact on flights at Dublin Airport today,\" the airport said in a Tuesday X post.\n\nIt added that nearly 100 flights had been canceled as of 4 p.m., while about 10 had been diverted.\n\n\"Challenging wind conditions have meant some aircraft have been unable to land and take off at Dublin Airport for extended periods this afternoon.\"\n\nOperations largely returned to normal the following day, with the airport calling Tuesday \"a day of significant disruption.\"\n\nRyanair said the flight eventually left Manchester once weather conditions improved. It took off at around 7:30 p.m. that evening and landed in Dublin just after 8:10 p.m.",

    "fullText": "\"Ultimately, what matters is your own interpretation of the ending and of the story,\" Expedition 33 creative director Guillaume Broche told GameSpot.\n\n on December 10, 2025 at 10:53AM PST\n\nThe Game Awards are just around the corner, and while this time of year is surely exciting for all the nominees--and those of us eager for new game announcements--this year, there is one studio in particular that has more reason than any to celebrate: Sandfall Interactive.\n\nEarlier this year, the small-scale studio took the world by storm with its debut title, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Despite being Sandfall's first game, the narrative-driven, turn-based RPG quickly entered the pantheon of all-time greatest RPGs, earning nearly universal critical acclaim for its artistry, story, and espousal of mechanics and themes typically associated with Japanese RPGs.\n\nNow, Sandfall Interactive stands poised to make The Game Awards history. Last month, the studio broke The Game Awards' record for most award nominations, earning a whopping 13, including Game of the Year. Earlier this year, I spoke with the studio's creative director, Guillaume Broche, who said the team was in \"disbelief\" about how the game has been received; it stands to reason that this sentiment has only grown with the game's tremendous success.\n\nBroche also shared a bit of a behind-the-scenes look at the game's development, explaining how there were \"a lot of arguments\" about the game's ending, why the team opted for minimal user interface, and how many people are still unaware of the game's biggest inspiration.\n\nGameSpot: Firstly, I'd love to know: What is the atmosphere of the studio following the game's tremendous success?\n\nBroche: I think a lot of us are still in disbelief with how the game’s launched and how fans have embraced it. Every day we say to each other, \"Is this real?\" or, \"Can you believe that?\" when we see another milestone reached or that our favorite game developer or studio reached out and congratulated us. It's all really overwhelming in a way, and we’re super grateful for everyone for their faith and support.\n\nAs I played through Expedition 33, it felt to me like the team took a \"less is more\" approach to creating the game. There are few UI elements on the screen and oftentimes, the character's expressions and what they don't say are just as impactful as what they do. That said, I'd like to hear in your own words about your design philosophies and principles, if you could elaborate on them.\n\nWe always wanted to tell a story that felt realistic and grounded. Of course, we have fantasy elements in the story, but at its core it’s a fundamentally human story. And in that story we wanted to have subtle, realistic interactions and emotions--which is why there’s a certain \"less is more\" feeling, like you say. It just makes the game feel more \"real\" in our eyes, or at least easier to engage with and relate to. Not every interaction in real life is a perfectly written, theatrical conversation--sometimes it’s just a look, or subtle moments of quietness, that have the most impact.\n\nFor the UI, we also wanted to have that same grounded approach to exploration. We trust the player to find their way through our levels, to understand our systems, and to engage with the world in the way we intended. We took some inspirations from games we grew up with in that sense, avoiding bloating our game with systems and designs that ultimately don’t improve the main game experience.\n\nI've found that Clair Obscur is phenomenal in working within shades of grey and every character feels deeply human. As such, reflecting on the game's ethics and big decisions are both interesting and challenging. Do you believe there truly is a true or \"good\" ending to the game?\n\nThat’s something we've had a lot of arguments about in the team too! I think your reaction to the endings, and which one is the \"good\" ending, is super subjective and related to your own personal experiences in real life. And I think that’s a strength of our writing and story--kudos to our Lead Writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, and our amazing mocap and voice actors for their performances--sometimes there is no clear \"good\" or \"bad\" choice in life that everyone will be happy with, and living within the grey, and those complex choices, are what makes us real people. Ultimately, what matters is your own interpretation of the ending and of the story.\n\nMany sites have been quick to note Legend of Dragoon, the Final Fantasy series, and even From Software titles as games that Clair Obscur has seemingly drawn inspiration from, but are there any other works that inspired you that you want to talk about?\n\nActually, I didn’t play Legend of Dragoon before coming up with the QTEs (quick-time events) during skills. I learnt later that a game did something similar! There are also other inspirations like the Persona series, but also action games like Devil May Cry and Nier.\n\nOne major inspiration is a French novel called La Horde du Contrevent. It tells the story of a group of explorers--or an expedition--travelling across the world to find the source of the supernatural wind that sweeps across the world. Their tale, and the human stories of the team and their discoveries as they travel the world, were also an inspiration for us as we developed a story of our own expeditioners traveling across the world. I’d recommend that anyone who’s a fan of our story picks up this book, but I don’t think it’s been translated into English fully since it’s so densely written with so much nuance in the French language. So I guess maybe fans should learn French, and then read the novel!\n\nWhether Clair Obscur will break the record currently held by The Last of Us: Part II and take home more than seven awards from The Game Awards remains to be seen. However, with 13 nominations and a Game of the Year award on the line, it's certainly worth tuning in to see what happens. The Game Awards airs tomorrow, December 11, at 9:30 PM ET / 6:30 PM PT.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?
