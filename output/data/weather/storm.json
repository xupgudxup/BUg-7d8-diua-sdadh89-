Competitors like United and Delta had canceled fewer than a dozen.\n\n\"Flight attendants are bearing the brunt of the company's inability to recover the operation in the aftermath of Winter Storm Fern,\" the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, the union for American Airlines cabin crew, said on Tuesday evening.\n\n\"Many are stranded with no hotels and broken sequences that the company has been unable to repair,\" it added.\n\nIn an Instagram post, APFA also said that flight attendants would receive double pay for any flights on Wednesday.\n\nAmerican Airlines did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAmerican was the worst-affected airline as Winter Storm Fern wreaked havoc on much of the US.\n\nIn its quarterly earnings on Tuesday, the airline said it had resulted in over 9,000 flight cancellations, which made it the \"largest weather-related operational disruption\" in American's history.\n\nThe airline also estimated that the storm would cost it between $150 million and $200 million.\n\nDallas-Fort Worth International, American's main hub, was also the most-impacted airport.\n\nIn a Monday statement, the airline said a range of adverse weather conditions hampered operations there, including nearly six hours of ice pellets and over three hours of snow.\n\nFour inches of snow fell in 48 hours at the airport, per the National Weather Service.\n\nThe impact was also outsize, given that Dallas doesn't have as much infrastructure to handle winter storms as cities in the northeast.\n\nOn Tuesday, American Airlines said operations there were \"showing considerable day-to-day progress.\"\n\nIt also pointed to difficulties for airline and airport staff to travel to work.\n\n\"I apologise to customers,\" CEO Robert Isom told CNBC on Tuesday morning. \"We're gonna get back on track, I think, over the next two, three days.

    "fullText": "HOUSTON (AP) — Winter's brutal grip on the U.S. East is not letting up, with coming days bringing subfreezing temperatures that will plunge deep into what had been a toasty Florida peninsula and a powerful blizzard forecast that may strike the Atlantic coast.\n\nDeep cold is forecast to stick around at least into the first week of February. Meteorologists are also watching what could become a “ bomb cyclone ” — a quickly intensifying storm that’s a winter version of a hurricane — forming off the Carolinas Friday night into Saturday.\n\n“A major winter storm appears to be coming to the Carolinas,” said meteorologist Peter Mullinax of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Weather Prediction Center.\n\nThat storm could dump snow — at least 6 inches (15 centimeters) with white-out conditions — in the Carolinas, northern Georgia and southern Virginia. After that, it could turn and plow through the Interstate 95 corridor late Saturday into Sunday to dump loads more snow from Washington to Boston, further paralyzing much of the country. Or it could deliver a glancing blow, mostly striking places like Cape Cod.\n\nAlternatively, it could just veer off harmlessly to sea. Meteorologists and forecast models aren't yet settling on a single outcome.\n\n“The confidence is much higher that in the coastal Carolinas and Virginia that there will be significant snowfall this weekend,” said James Belanger, vice president for meteorology at the Weather Channel and its parent company. \"The real question is going to be the trajectory it takes” from there.\n\nPrivate meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former NOAA chief scientist, said for the mid-Atlantic and north it's a “boom or bust” situation. “If it happens (to go along the coast) it's going to be a big-time event.\"\n\nModels still disagree on storm track\n\nOn Tuesday forecast models were all over the place, from out to sea to inward toward Philadelphia. By Wednesday morning they started to agree that “we’re likely to see some form of a powerful coastal storm somewhere east of North Carolina, off the Delmarva coast, but they still disagree as to where,” Mullinax said.\n\nChances of the storm veering away from the East Coast entirely had diminished Wednesday morning, but hadn't disappeared altogether, Mullinax said.\n\nOf all the options, “from D.C. up to New York is probably the most unclear,” Mullinax said. He said a mere 50-mile (80-kilometer) difference in the storm's center will be critical. AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Pydynowski said it may be hard for the southern mid-Atlantic to avoid some kind of snow, whether a little or a lot.\n\nThis storm will blow harder than the last one\n\nThis weekend's storm will differ from the previous storm, which started with moist air from the Pacific that combined with a deep plunge of Arctic air from an elongated polar vortex supplemented by more moisture from the south and east, meteorologists said. The last storm had little wind. This one will generate high winds, even if the snow misses the Washington area, generating gusts that could still reach 40 mph (65 kph), plunging wind chills near subzero Fahrenheit (minus 18 Celsius), Mullinax said.\n\n“It looks like a pretty strong and explosive storm so everybody is going to have some gusty winds,\" Pydynowski said, even inland places that won't come close to getting snow like Pittsburgh. Strong winds may take daytime temperatures in the teens there down to feeling like they are below zero, he said.\n\n“This is what we'd consider more of a classic nor'easter,” Belanger said, describing a storm forming around the U.S. Gulf Coast crossing into the Atlantic and going up that coast.\n\nFrigid air and warm water combine to make strong storm\n\nIn this case, one key is warmer-than-normal water in the Gulf of Mexico — partly from human-caused climate change — and the always toasty Atlantic Gulf Stream, said Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist for the nonprofit Climate Central.\n\nWhen that happens the storm “pulls in more moisture and it gives it more strength,” she said.\n\nOnce the core of the storm nears the Carolinas its pressure will drop tremendously, enough to qualify for what meteorologists call “bombogenesis” or “a bomb cyclone,” That will give it the effect of a moderate-strength hurricane, including huge winds, but in the winter, Maue and Belanger said.\n\nIf the storm does come ashore, those winds and extra snow could cause massive snow drifts big enough to bury cars, Maue said.\n\nArctic chill sticks around and goes further south\n\nWhat is more certain is that the Arctic chill in the Midwest and East will continue through mid-February, with only slight warmups that would still be below normal, meteorologists said.\n\nAnd this new weekend storm “is going to take that cold and it's going to spill right down the heart of the Florida peninsula,\" Pydynowski said. Orlando is forecast to go well below freezing and only have a high of 48 F (9 C), smashing temperature records, while even Miami and Key West will flirt with record cold Sunday and Monday, meteorologists said.\n\nThe outlook for Florida was cold enough to raise concerns about damage to the state’s citrus and strawberries.\n\n“We're going into a brutally cold period,” Maue said.\n\nAfter this weekend storm, long-range models see another one at the end of the first week of February, Maue said. Meteorologists see the East stuck in a pattern of bitter cold and snowstorms because of the plunging Arctic air and warm water.\n\nEast Coast snowstorms don't happen too often, but “when it happens, it happens in bunches,\" said former National Weather Service director Louis Uccellini, who has written meteorology textbooks on winter snowstorms.\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "fullText": "As the East Coast digs out from a massive snowstorm, a potential nor'easter could bring more snow to the region this weekend.\n\nHere's what you need to know about this kind of powerful storm:\n\nNor'easters along the East Coast get their name because the winds over the coastal area are typically from the northeast.\n\nMORE: Potential nor'easter headed to East Coast this weekend: Latest forecast\n\nThese storms may occur at any time of year but are most frequent and most violent between September and April.\n\nNor'easters nearly always bring precipitation in the form of heavy rain or snow, as well as gale-force winds, rough seas, and, occasionally, coastal flooding.\n\nNor'easters usually develop in the latitudes between Georgia and New Jersey, within 100 miles east or west of the East Coast.\n\nMORE: Here's how to stay safe in the cold\n\nThe heavily populated region between Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, New York and Boston -- known as the \"Interstate 95 Corridor\" -- is especially impacted by nor'easters.\n\nThese storms progress generally northeastward and typically attain maximum intensity near New England and the Maritime Provinces of Canada.\n\nThe East Coast provides an ideal breeding ground for nor'easters. During winter, the polar jet stream transports cold, Arctic air southward across the plains of Canada and the United States, then eastward toward the Atlantic Ocean where warm air from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic tries to move northward.\n\nThe warm waters of the Gulf Stream help keep the coastal waters relatively mild during the winter, which in turn helps warm the cold winter air over the water. This difference in temperature between the warm air over the water and cold Arctic air over the land is the fuel that feeds nor'easters.\n\nSome well-known nor'easters include the New England blizzard of February 1978, the March 1993 \"Superstorm\" and the Boston snowstorms of January and February 2015, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",

A blast of arctic air moved in behind the storm, sending temperatures plummeting downward in a swath that will extend again from Texas to Maine and as far south as Central Florida.\n\n\"Right now it's impossible to determine where the storm will set up, where the precipitation could fall and what kind of precipitation it might be,\" Santorelli said. \"There's a lot of uncertainty on where it tracks and how much precipitation parts of the East might get.\"\n\nEarly indications from the models indicate portions of the Gulf Coast and East Coast could begin experiencing some effects of the next storm as soon as Friday, Jan. 30, according to forecasters at AccuWeather, a private weather company.\n\n\"How fast the storm strengthens will be a determining factor in the final track of the storm this weekend and whether or not it moves up the East Coast,\" said Paul Pasterok, AccuWeather's long range outlook expert.\n\nRain is most likely south of Interstate 10 from Louisiana to Florida, and snow could mix in to the north across parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, AccuWeather predicted.

About 140,000 remained without power in hard-hit Mississippi, and 115,000 \n\nAfter a sleepless night in Iuka, Mississippi, Adrian Ronca-Hohn said he awoke Monday to what looked \"like a war zone.”\n\n“We couldn’t go 10 seconds without hearing what sounded like a gunshot,\" the 23-year-old football coach said of falling trees and branches. “You’d hear a pop, a hard pop, and you’d hear the whistle of it falling, and then it would crash to the ground and just kind of explode.”\n\nAs temperatures across the South are expected to reach their coldest this week early Tuesday morning, people without power are trying to survive.\n\n“We have a lot of people without heat, without power and without water,\" Ronca-Hohn said. We have a lot of mobile homes down here that aren’t very well-insulated.\"\n\nHere's a look at the storm by the numbers.\n\nOne inch of ice (2.5 centimeters) recorded in multiple communities across Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Alabama, and South Carolina.\n\nThe temperature in Fahrenheit (minus 17 Celsius) that’s expected early Tuesday morning in Tennessee’s capital city, where thousands remain without power.\n\nInches of sleet (17 centimeters) that fell at Clinton National Airport in Little Rock, Arkansas, according to preliminary totals.\n\nThe number of days it could take to restore power in Allen County, Kentucky, city officials said. Other communities estimated similar time frames. In New Albany, Mississippi, the city utility warned Sunday that restoring power to all its customers “will take a minimum of a week and possibly more depending on conditions.”\n\nInches of snow (56.4 centimeters) that fell during the storm in Sterling, Massachusetts. The number is a preliminary figure through Monday morning.\n\nThe number of places in Nashville where people without power can go to warm up and charge their phones, including fire and police stations.\n\nThe temperature in Fahrenheit (50 Celsius) inside Marshall Ramsey’s home in Oxford, Mississippi, on Monday morning after he lost power. The weekend ice storm “was like a demonic symphony of trees breaking, transformers blowing and thunder,” said Ramsey, a longtime editorial cartoonist who now teaches at the University of Mississippi.\n\nThe number of dogs rescued from a rural property in the Tupelo, Mississippi, area just before the ice storm by Paws of War. The New York-based nonprofit rescues animals and places them with veterans and first responders.\n\nThe number of customers without power in Mississippi on Monday afternoon, according to poweroutage.com.\n\nThe number of Nashville Electric Service customers without power in the Nashville area on Monday afternoon, according to the company.\n\nThe number of customers without power in Tennessee on Monday afternoon, according to poweroutage.com.",

Over 10,000 flights were canceled over the weekend, the most since the pandemic, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm. Nearly 2,000 are already canceled on Monday morning, and authorities are urging many Americans to skip the morning commute.\n\nTake a look at the impact of the potentially historic storm below.\n\nSnow turned to ice in many affected states as the storm moved from the Southwest to the Northeast.\n\nThe Departments of Transportation in several states, including New York and Texas, have urged residents to avoid roadways during the winter storm and through Monday.\n\nSome Americans ventured into the frosty weather with skis, including folks in Indianapolis and Washington, D.C.\n\nAviation analytics company Cirium said over 10,000 flights were canceled over the weekend. Nearly 2,000 flights have been canceled so far on Monday. Over 50% of American Airlines flights were canceled on Sunday and over 75% of JetBlue flights.\n\nIce and sleet are other factors at play during the winter storm. On Sunday, the National Service Prediction Center said parts of the country have received over 0.5 inches of ice.\n\nIce storm warnings remained in effect for much of the storm's path.\n\nThe power was out for nearly a million Americans by Sunday night, according to poweroutage.us, an analytics firm tracking electricity outages across the United States.\n\nTexas and other states were seeing the most outages as of Sunday evening.\n\nSalt is spread on roadways to improve traction and make plowing easier.\n\nIn Louisville, city workers used a mixture of salt and calcium chloride.\n\n\"Calcium chloride helps salt remain effective in extremely cold temperatures,\" the city said on its website.\n\nWhile many Americans stayed inside, swaths of workers across the country braved the weather to help clear snow and perform other storm-related tasks.\n\nNew York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani praised city workers in an X post on Sunday, writing, \"Thank you to all of the city workers who have been working around the clock this weekend to keep us safe.

    "fullText": "(Francis Chung/POLITICO via AP Images)\n\nGov. Andy Beshear (D-KY) had a laugh at Sen. Ted Cruz’s (R-TX) expense over a fake X post accusing the governor of being out of town during the massive winter storm that brought dangerous amounts of snow and ice to many parts of the U.S.\n\nCruz posted a “thinking” emoji along with a retweet of a post by the Kentucky Freedom Coalition showing Beshear and his wife posing in front of a church in Europe.\n\nThe account, that’s also followed by Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) posted, “The liberal media went wild when Ted Cruz wasn’t in Texas for the major freeze a few years back. Well, Kentucky is in a declared emergency and @AndyBeshearKYis touring Europe. The media won’t say a word though.”\n\n— Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) January 25, 2026\n\nBeshear responded, “Sorry for missing this earlier, @tedcruz. Been busy leading my state’s emergency response all day. From Kentucky.”\n\nSorry for missing this earlier, @tedcruz. Been busy leading my state's emergency response all day. From Kentucky. https://t.co/v71K8NvjkS\n\n— Andy Beshear (@AndyBeshearKY) January 25, 2026\n\nWashington Post reporter Aaron Blake added some additional context, writing, “This photo of Beshear in Europe is a full week old. He gave a briefing in Kentucky today.”\n\nAccording to WKYT, Beshear spent last week in Europe “with a delegation from Team Kentucky, attending the World Economic Forum and meeting with company leaders in Finland, Sweden, and Switzerland.”\n\nCruz famously received massive backlash in 2021 after escaping to sunny Cancun as a brutal winter storm left millions of his constituents “stranded in sub-freezing temperatures without electricity and water,” according to The Hill.\n\nThe contrite senator returned to Texas within 24-hours of being spotted on his travels. Cruz eventually apologized, saying, “It was obviously a mistake, and in hindsight, I wouldn’t have done it.”\n\nThis week, as Texas braced once again for an onslaught of weather, a Texas political strategist posted, “Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was spotted earlier today, January 20, 2026, on a plane heading to Laguna Beach as the state of Texas braces for a rare ice threat and arctic cold front.”\n\nOf the California trip, a Cruz spokesperson told KXAN that the work trip “was scheduled weeks in advance.”\n\nThe spokesperson continued, “He will be back in Texas before the storm is projected to hit.”\n\nSenator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was spotted earlier today, January 20, 2026, on a plane heading to Laguna Beach as the state of Texas braces for a rare ice threat and arctic cold front. pic.twitter.com/lVTcqP8LR4\n\n— Shea Jordan Smith (@shea_jordan) January 21, 2026\n\nCruz posted that he did, in fact, return to Texas the day before the storm hit.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Cruz has been called out for retweeting a fake post. In 2023, Cruz shared an image of what looked like a shark swimming on a flooded highway in Los Angeles.\n\nThe post Kentucky Gov Clowns Ted Cruz for Getting Duped By European Pic: ‘Sorry For Missing This… Been Busy Leading My State’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

Lake Erie has greater ice coverage than the other four Great Lakes.\n\nHowever, the National Ice Center says that Lake Erie usually has the greatest maximum coverage each year since it’s shallow compared to the other Great Lakes.\n\nWeather calculations: So you're freezing? Forgive the Pa. explorer who invented wind chill\n\nOn the Erie side of Lake Erie, employees at East End Angler Bait Shop at 4702 East Lake Road report that the ice on Misery Bay and Horseshoe Pond is 7 to 9 inches thick.\n\nAccording to the National Ice Center, the thickest ice is in the western basin, west of Point Pelee near Canada.\n\nIce in this region is consistently 4 to 6 inches thick, with some areas of greater thickness.\n\nThe ice near the east basin in Cleveland is newer and thinner, with a thickness of 2 inches or less.\n\nRecently, cold temperatures have allowed for some new ice formation.\n\nThe 80% coverage was a large uptick in the month of January. Around Jan. 13, the ice coverage was only reported as a few percent with a little ice located near Point Pelee.\n\nScientists with the National Ice Center say that just select portions of the Lake Erie are left unfrozen.\n\n“Just portions of the southeastern shore and a couple areas toward the west of Long Point,” said Jonathan Edwards-Opperman, physical scientist with the U.S. National Ice Center. “However, these should freeze over in the next few days.”\n\nThere is a silver lining in the upcoming cold temperatures and snow storm. Once Lake Erie fully freezes over, the lake effect snow stops.\n\n“The ice acts as a lid, cutting off the moisture source for the lake-effect snow,” Edwards-Opperman said.\n\nA graphic provided by weather.gov shows the following:\n\nLess than 2 inches of ice is never safe to walk on;\n\n4 inches of ice can support ice fishing and walking;\n\n5 inches of ice can support small groups ice skating;\n\n6 inches of ice can support snow mobiles and ATVs;\n\n9 inches of ice can support cars;\n\nand 12 inches or more of ice can support medium size trucks.\n\nIt’s important to note that ice on the lake is never 100% safe.\n\nBelow zero: Bundle up when revisiting the coldest days in Erie County history\n\n“In addition to the information on the graphic, I would add that whenever there are strong winds, especially when blowing offshore onto the lake, there is an enhanced risk for breakup of shore fast ice under the wind stress,” Edwards-Opperman said.\n\nNicholas Sorensen can be contacted at Nsorensen@usatodayco.com.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Erie Times-News: Lake Erie is nearly frozen over.

Ted Cruz traveled to Cancun in 2021 as a winter storm caused extended outages across the state.\n\nCruz was seen this week leaving Texas as reports of the winter storm's intensity grew.\n\nCruz returned to Texas Friday. He poked fun at social media chatter about the incident on his X account.\n\nI’ve returned home from my work trip. It’s 66 degrees & beautiful. A storm is expected tomorrow night.\n\nBut I am reliably informed by Twitter that if I simply raise up my hand on Texas soil, the storm will turn around & sunshine, rainbows & unicorns will emerge. Let it be. ☀️🌈🦄 pic.twitter.com/owtD6FvJyb\n\n— Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) January 23, 2026\n\nA representative for Jenkins told FOX 4 the trip was pre-planned and that he will receive regular updates on the developing weather in North Texas.\n\n\"The County’s full focus is on keeping people safe and services running,\" Lauren Trimble, his Chief of Staff, told FOX 4. \"The Judge prepared in advance, ensuring emergency operations and coordination were in place during his travel which was scheduled months ago.\"\n\n\"Dallas County’s experienced teams are ready to respond as conditions change, and he will continue to get regular updates.\"\n\nHis office further responded on their plans with Jenkins out of office.\n\n\"The county’s readiness and emergency operations are fully staffed and coordinated. Chief of Emergency Services Scott Forster will oversee and coordinate the response,\" Jenkins' office said. \"Chief of Staff Lauren Trimble is empowered to sign orders, but the Governor's order makes that unnecessary.\"\n\nInformation in this story came from viewer photos and an email from Dallas County.",

Ice accumulations of a few tenths of an inch can make roads slick, and local power outages are possible where ice burdens trees and lines. If accumulations are lower, an icy glaze would be the main issue.\n\nHouston TranStar is reporting the following icy roadway locations:\n\nThe Texas Department of Transportation has a map that shows icy road locations and other hazards.\n\nMonitor local weather broadcasts and check the latest conditions from the National Weather Service before hitting the road. To monitor real-time road conditions in your area, visit Drive Texas or check specific traffic updates for Houston (or via Houston TranStar), or call (800) 452-9292.\n\nIf you must drive in inclement weather, allow additional time to reach your destination and share your travel plans with a friend or family member, so someone knows the route you’re taking.\n\nWhen driving on icy roads, drive slowly and increase the distance between your vehicle and others when stopping. Do not use cruise control during poor driving conditions and ensure your vehicle has a full tank of gas before you head out.\n\nSafety officials tell Texans to be aware and approach bridges and overpasses slowly as ice can accumulate before drivers are able to see it on the roads. Drivers should also watch for downed trees and power lines. If a stoplight is out, treat the intersection as a four-way stop.\n\nSafety officials ask Texans to keep a well-stocked emergency kit with warm clothes, food, water, cell phone battery/charger and first aid items.\n\nFind more tips in this driving safety guide.\n\nWith severe winter weather on the way this weekend, you should have a way to get important updates if the power goes out.\n\nThe FOX LOCAL app will allow you to stay up to date with livestreams, the latest forecasts, news stories and weather alerts in real time, all from your mobile phone or tablet.\n\nYou can also \n\nSeveral Houston-area school districts have opted to stay closed on Monday.

    "fullText": "An ice storm warning is in place for Knoxville and parts of East Tennessee.\n\nWhile the rest of the Volunteer State is under a winter storm warning, East Tennessee is bracing for crippling ice.\n\nThe ice storm warning runs from 1 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 24, through 7 p.m. Sunday, Jan. 25, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nIt is in place for the following counties: Anderson, Bledsoe, Bradley, Cherokee, Clay, Hamilton, Jefferson, Knox, Loudon, Marion, McMinn, Meigs, Rhea, Roane and Sequatchie.\n\nNortheast Tennessee has a winter storm warning for the following counties: Campbell, Claiborne, Grainger, Hamblen, Hancock, Hawkins, Morgan, Scott, Sullivan and Union.\n\nHere's what to know about the warnings and how to stay safe.\n\nAn ice storm warning is issued when an area may receive a quarter-inch or more of ice accumulation, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n\"Travel is strongly discouraged. If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency. Prepare for possible power outages,\" the weather service warned.\n\nA winter weather advisory has been issued for the Great Smoky Mountains, where mixed precipitation of snow and sleet is expected.\n\nThe warning is in effect from 1 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 24, to 7 p.m. Sunday, Jan. 25.\n\n\"Power outages and tree damage are possible due to the ice. Travel will be hazardous. Gusty winds could bring down tree branches,\" the weather service warned.\n\nThe mountaintops have a high wind warning from 7 p.m. Saturday to 7 p.m. Sunday. Widespread power outages are expected.\n\nA winter storm watch indicates severe weather is on the way. The watch will be issued at least 24 hours before a storm that has a risk of being hazardous, according to the National Weather Service. The storm's occurrence, location or timing may be uncertain under a watch.\n\nA watch will normally be upgraded to either a warning or an advisory, depending on how a storm develops.\n\nA winter storm warning means that a storm is imminent. Warnings are issued for a significant winter weather event, including snow, ice, sleet or blowing snow ‒ or a combination of these hazards, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nIf a winter storm warning is issued, it's best to stay off the roads.\n\nA winter storm advisory means the storm is happening, but the winter weather storm dangers are limited. Be prepared for winter driving conditions and possible travel difficulties. Use caution when driving.\n\nThere are things that you can do to prepare yourself, your car and your home for the upcoming winter weather.\n\nMake sure that you have food, extra water and warm clothes ahead of a storm in case the ice or snow causes a power outage, according to the Red Cross. It's also helpful to have a snow shovel and salt on hand for your driveway and sidewalks.\n\nAlso, consider filling up your car with gas before a snowstorm. Keep a blanket, an emergency kit and warm clothes in your car in case you get stuck on the side of the road, according to the Red Cross.\n\nThere's still much uncertainty about the details of the expected winter storm this weekend. Regardless, now is the time to start preparing. pic.twitter.com/CwDRlQLVXV\n\n— NWS Morristown (@NWSMorristown) January 21, 2026\n\nAllison Kiehl covers trending and breaking news from Knoxville for the Tennessee Connect Team.

    "description": "American Airlines and JetBlue are making it free to rebook flights ahead of a major winter storm.",
    "fullText": "Major airlines are making it free to change your flights ahead of a dangerous winter storm.\n\nSouthwest Airlines, American Airlines, United Airlines, and JetBlue are waiving rebooking fees for flights to and from affected regions this weekend.\n\nIf your travel plans this weekend include major cities such as Dallas, Austin, Oklahoma City, Nashville, Atlanta, Charlotte, Washington, DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston, you may want to contact your airline to avoid prolonged delays or cancellations at the airport. The National Weather Service is warning that more than 230 million Americans will be affected, from the Southwest to New England.\n\nEven if you won't change your plans, your flight may still get canceled. Delta Air Lines said Thursday it is canceling flights at airports in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Tennessee, citing safety concerns caused by heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain. The airline will also be bringing in cold-weather specialists.\n\nAs of Thursday evening, based on the Misery Map, which tracks real-time flight disruptions, there hasn't been a spike in delays or cancellations.\n\nBased on recent storms, such as the one that hit over Thanksgiving and coincided with the end of the government shutdown, mass cancellations may be inevitable. So it's good to know your passenger rights and your options when things don't go according to plan.\n\nIf your flight is canceled and you choose not to rebook, the airline is legally required to provide you with a cash refund — not a voucher or credit.\n\nHowever, things are different for delays. The Trump Administration recently killed a proposal that would have required airlines to compensate passengers for long delays, so flyers largely have to rely on airline goodwill or their credit cards to get anything for the inconvenience.\n\nSome airlines have committed to providing accommodations, transportation, and food during a controllable overnight delay or cancellation, as outlined in the Airline Customer Service Dashboard.\n\nControllable disruptions include issues such as maintenance or crew staffing. Frontier Airlines is the only carrier that does not offer accommodations in the event of a controllable overnight delay or cancellation, but it will provide a meal voucher.\n\nIt still doesn't hurt to ask for a meal or hotel voucher when a non-controllable issue arises, such as the weather. The worst they can say is no.\n\nDuring disruptions, airlines often allow you to make changes via their mobile app or website, rather than waiting on clogged phone lines or in long customer service lines.\n\nIf this isn't an option, try an online chat. Carriers like Delta Air Lines allow you to text a representative for help.\n\nYou can put yourself in the virtual queue and wait in line at the airport, potentially upping your chances of speaking with an agent sooner.\n\nHere are the phone numbers for each airline:\n\nTravel credit cards, such as the Chase Sapphire Reserve and the American Express Platinum, offer built-in insurance that reimburses travelers for hotel, meal, and transportation expenses incurred due to certain flight disruptions.\n\nThe weather is typically covered. For this to work, the traveler would have needed to book their flight with that travel card.\n\nIf your credit card doesn't offer travel insurance, it may be worthwhile to purchase a separate trip insurance policy before traveling. This type of insurance can help reimburse costs you might lose due to flight problems, such as prepaid hotel stays or cruise bookings.\n\nHowever, you must purchase this insurance before any travel disruptions occur — once you know a flight might be affected, it's likely too late.",

    "description": "Rule number one: stay inside.",
    "fullText": "With a historically bad winter storm expected to bring snow, ice, and sub-zero wind chills to many parts of the United States this weekend, it's a good time to make sure you're prepared for a potentially life-threatening disaster.\n\nWhile winter storms are generally less deadly than hurricanes and heat waves, they can be extremely dangerous, particularly when extremely cold, wind, and ice storms cause power outages. But with a little preparation and common sense, you should be all right when it gets extra snowy and cold. Here are some tips and instructions for blizzard and winter storm survival.\n\nThe map above, from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Weather Prediction Center shows the predicted course of the storm through Jan. 26. You can click the link to dig into predicted snow amounts, ice accumulation, and more, but the overall picture is a huge storm that is likely to affect more than 172 million people in the U.S. and bring record low temperatures. If you're anywhere in the affected area, take time to plan for a potential snow-and-cold disaster before it happens.\n\nFor a winter storm, you want to prepare for a few cold days without power. You should have a basic survival bag tucked away in an easy-to-access spot in your house for any disaster. According to the government, a boilerplate emergency kit will contain:\n\nWater and non-perishable food for several days\n\nExtra cell phone battery or charger\n\nBattery-powered or hand crank radio that can receive NOAA Weather Radio tone alerts and extra batteries\n\nDust mask to help filter contaminated air, and plastic sheeting and duct tape to shelter in place\n\nMoist towelettes, garbage bags, and plastic ties for personal sanitation\n\nNon-sparking wrench or pliers to turn off utilities\n\nCan opener (if your kit contains canned food)\n\nExtra clothing and blankets (although I bet you already know where these are in your home)\n\nFor winter storm saftey, I'd add a carbon monoxide detector, just to be as safe as possible when shut up inside your house. Here’s a handy shopping list you can take to the supermarket, complete with “extra credit” items like prescriptions medicine and games to keep you busy.\n\nIf you only follow one rule for blizzard survival, make it this one: Do not be outside during a winter storm. If you’re home, you probably won’t be snowbound for more than a week (and even that is unlikely), and you’ll be much warmer than if you were outside.\n\nIf you are home during a blizzard or winter storm (and you should be) take the following steps:\n\nDon’t forget your pets. Bring them inside, too.\n\nBe able to access multiple sources of information about the weather, from the internet, to television, to radio, and make sure you can get updates even if the power goes out.\n\nIf you have electric heat, crank it up as the storm approaches in case you lose power.\n\nStay in a small, insulated area: To conserve heat, stay in one room as much as possible.\n\nStuff towels and rags under doors to conserve heat.\n\nBe careful with alternative heaters like kerosene. They can start a fire, and if not properly ventilated, you can die from carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nCover windows at night but uncover them during day to catch any heat from sunlight.\n\nSave batteries: Use your phone to check in on friends, family and neighbors by or to call authorities only.\n\nAs cold weather approaches, you may hear difference kinds of buzzwords for approaching storms on your NOAA weather radio and from other sources. Here’s a crash course on the relevant winter weather warnings from the National Weather Service, and what they mean, with the most severe listed first.\n\nA warning indicates an 80% or greater probability of conditions that pose a threat to life or property, and that travel will become difficult to impossible. In other words: “This storm is serious business.”\n\nBlizzard Warning: A blizzard warning means that the following conditions are occurring or expected within the next 12 to 18 hours: Snow and/or blowing snow reducing visibility to 1/4 mile or less for three hours or longer, and sustained winds of 35 mph or greater or frequent gusts to 35 mph or greater.\n\nWinter Storm Warning: A winter storm warning is issued when a significant combination of hazardous winter weather is occurring or imminent. That means five inches or more of snow/sleet within a 12-hour period or seven inches or more of snow/sleet within a 24-hour period, and/or enough ice accumulation to cause damage to trees or power lines. It also can mean a life-threatening or damaging combination of snow and/or ice accumulation with wind.\n\nWatches are intended to provide enough lead time so you can make plans to stay safe. They are usually issued a day or so before the predicted event when there’s a greater than 50% chance of it happening.\n\nWinter Storm Watch: A winter storm watch is issued when there is the potential for significant and hazardous winter weather within 48 hours. This doesn’t mean that significant and hazardous winter weather will occur—it only means it is possible.\n\nBlizzard Watch: This means conditions are favorable for a blizzard event—low visibility with winds of at least 35 mph.\n\nWinter storm advisories indicate that less serious (but still concerning) weather conditions are possible. Remember, though, a storm can change from one condition to another, so keep checking back. Go to the National Weather Service’s site for more in-depth weather-warning information.\n\nBeing trapped in your car during a snow-mergency is bad, but not necessarily deadly. Here’s a detailed trapped-in-your-car survival guide, but here are the main points:\n\nDon’t panic: As survival scenarios go, being trapped in a car in a snowstorm is not that bad. It definitely beats being trapped in a snowstorm without a car.\n\nMake sure your tailpipe is not clogged: When you first realize you are trapped, check the exhaust pipe to make sure it’s clear. You don’t want to die of carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nIndicate you are in distress to the outside world: Call 911 if you can. Tie a brightly colored cloth or ribbon to your antenna or door. If the snow stops, raise your hood.\n\nStay in your vehicle: A car is an excellent survival shelter—a guy in Sweden survived in his car for two months, and he didn’t even seem to have had food or water. It is a bad idea to go walking around in a blizzard. You will get lost, cold, wet, and maybe even hit by another driver.\n\nBundle up: Wear as many layers as you can with the extra clothing you packed.\n\nCreate as small a space as possible: If you have blankets or jackets, create a little “fort” for yourself. A smaller space is easier to heat. You could try lining the windows with newspaper or those discarded fast food bags you never cleaned up.\n\nRun your car for 10 minutes an hour: Experts recommend starting your car and running the heater, hazard lights, and dome light for about 10 minutes per hour. Roll down the window a crack while the engine is running to avoid the possibility of inhaling carbon monoxide. Other than cold, carbon monoxide is your biggest danger.\n\nDon’t play on your phone: I know it’s boring to sit in the car for so long, but only use your cell to call emergency numbers. Don’t be surprised if the authorities tell you to “sit tight,” though.\n\nIf you run out of water, drink melted snow: You can get a little moisture into your body by drinking melted snow.\n\nSo you didn’t listen when I said to stay home, huh? Now you’re stumbling blindly through a snowstorm and freezing to death. I won’t sugar coat it: things are bad for you, and your survival depends on the severity of the storm. But here’s what to do:\n\nFind shelter: Get out of the wind and snow. Don’t try to make it home or wherever else you’re going if there’s somewhere safe you can wait things out.\n\nCover up your exposed flesh: I imagine this would occur to you anyway, but just in case it doesn’t, cover up as much as possible to stay warm and avoid frostbite.\n\nBuild a shelter: The National Weather Service recommends the following if you can’t find a shelter: “Build a lean-to, windbreak, or snow cave for protection from the wind. Build a fire for heat and to attract attention. Place rocks around the fire to absorb and reflect heat.” I think they’re being very optimistic. During a serious blizzard, like Minnesota’s “Children’s Blizzard” of 1888, people died yards from their houses because they got disoriented and snow-blind, so you’re probably not going to have time to build an igloo or whatever in a real blizzard. But learn wilderness survival tactics if you are likely to be at risk.\n\nMelt snow for water: Melting snow for water is OK, but don’t eat it frozen—that will lower your body temperature.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has completely misunderstood what global warming means in a bonkers post on social media.\n\nThe U.S. is facing a potentially historically cold period, with the eastern two-thirds of the country expected to experience sub-zero temperatures and heavy snowfall, which could cause major disruption. For the president, that is proof enough that “global warming” is a hoax.\n\n“Record Cold Wave expected to hit 40 States,” he said on Truth Social. “Rarely seen anything like it before. Could the Environmental Insurrectionists please explain—WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GLOBAL WARMING???”\n\nIt is not entirely clear who he meant by “Environmental Insurrectionists.”\n\nThe world’s most powerful man has repeatedly shown he is apprehensive about the existence of climate change, championing fossil fuel policies and peddling conspiracy theories, despite an overwhelming body of scientific evidence that it poses a real and imminent threat.\n\nIt has long been public knowledge that the now-relegated term global warming does not mean that cold temperatures will not occur, but rather that the average temperature inside the Earth’s atmosphere will be higher, disrupting delicate environmental balances.\n\nThe term is now instead regarded as merely a part of the wider phenomenon of climate change.\n\nCold landmasses and warm waters in the Arctic are stretching the polar vortex, dragging cold air further south. When that cold air meets warm, moist southern air, it could cause heavy snow, PBS reports.\n\nOn its website, the American Red Cross said, “Winters are getting warmer and shorter because of the climate crisis. But, because a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, heavier snowfalls are more likely to occur,” the Guardian reports.\n\nThe BBC reports that “cities including Memphis, Nashville, Washington DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York,” could be blanketed with snow.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the weather could “pose a life-threatening risk of hypothermia and frostbite to exposed skin.”\n\nThe storm is expected to reach as far west as New Mexico, with around 230 million people staring down the barrel of 20-degree temperatures as state governors declare emergencies across the country.\n\nTrump’s disregard for the environment is well-documented. On his first day back in the Oval Office last year, he gave an executive order called “Putting people over fish,” where he disregarded the endangered delta smelt as “an essentially worthless fish,” and demanded water from their habitat be taken to fight fires hundreds of miles away.\n\nHe has also waged a long-running war on wind turbines, claiming “windmills” are making whales crazy and killing bald eagles, a point he illustrated on social media by posting a picture of a dead falcon in Israel.\n\nIn September, he gave a speech to the United Nations, where he said climate change is the “greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”\n\nDuring the same speech, he said, “I have a little standing order in the White House,” he said. “Never use the word ‘coal’. Only use the words ‘clean, beautiful coal’. Sounds much better, doesn’t it?”",

    "description": "One thing is certain about Sunday's storm: \"Whatever snow does fall isn't going anywhere fast as a cold airmass remains entrenched over the northeast next week.\"",
    "fullText": "Rhode Island and other parts of Southern New England could see up to 18 inches of snow from a storm starting Sunday and continuing into Monday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nA winter storm watch and a cold weather advisory have been issued, as dangerously cold weather will move into Southern New England ahead of the storm on Friday afternoon, Jan. 23.\n\n\"At the moment the most likely snowfall totals are in the 8-14 inch range,\" the weather service said in its forecast discussion early Friday morning.\n\nThe range could be higher, 12 to 18 inches, for most of Southern New England, the weather service indicated in a graphic posted to social media also early on Friday morning. The weather service predicted those snowfall totals early as part of its \"initial most likely snow accumulation forecast.\"\n\nSetting records: How often does RI get a foot of snow? How this weekend's storm stacks up\n\nIn a social media post, the agency characterized its confidence in the snowfall total forecast as \"medium\" and said, \"Keep in mind, this will be refined/changed as things come into better focus over the next 24-48 hours, so check back!\"\n\nThe 12- to 18-inch snowfall forecast indicated on the graphic is consistent throughout Southern New England, except for Block Island, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, which could get lower totals, 8 to 12 inches, due to the potential for mixed precipitation, the weather service said.\n\nThe snow is most likely to start Sunday morning into early Sunday afternoon, with the heaviest snowfall Sunday evening into early Monday morning, the weather service said. Light to moderate snow will linger during the day Monday, the weather service said.\n\n\"Travel will be difficult, especially Sunday night into Monday morning when accumulation rates will be highest,\" the weather service said.\n\nThe storm will affect millions of Americans as it moves across the central part of the country through the Southeast then into New England, according to forecasters.\n\n\"The system moving out of the plains will direct a plume of deep moisture and warm air into/over top of a dome of subfreezing air associated with a sprawling high pressure over the northeast which will lead to a prolonged period of snowfall, some of it heavy,\" the weather service says in its forecast discussion.\n\nComputer models are showing some \"varying degree of spread\" in the track of the storm, \"which is one factor that would lead us to be cautious in declaring exact snowfall amounts as the track is a factor,\" the weather service said.\n\nIn trying to determine the impact of winter storms, forecasters consider how close it will pass to a benchmark about 80 miles southeast of Nantucket, at 40 degrees north latitude and 70 degrees west longitude.\n\n\"Another related factor\" is a layer of warmer air that could \"lead to a period of mixed precipitation on the south coast overnight, potentially up into the south shore of eastern MA and northern RI,\" the weather service said.\n\n\"Whatever snow does fall isn't going anywhere fast as a cold airmass remains entrenched over the northeast next week (highs in the teens and 20s),\" the forecast discussion said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Providence Journal: RI weather forecast: Snow storm Sunday and Monday could dump 18 inches",

But over the last two weeks, the people who live here have felt even more isolated after they were left without a way of communicating with the outside world as a result of Storm Goretti.\n\n“I think people feel let down, angry, failed,” said Mark Pugh, an audiobook producer, who has spent more hours than he would care to tot up carefully picking his way out of Cucurrian and sitting in his car in a layby to find a mobile signal good enough to work from. “This storm has shown that Cornwall isn’t resilient enough. A lot is promised, but not enough is delivered.”\n\nGoretti brought down thousands of power, phone and broadband lines and caused countless trees to fall, including one that crushed the caravan of 50-year-old James Southey and killed him.\n\nFor days, many hundreds of people were left without power, water or both, but while those services have been restored, communication links in some places remain down a fortnight on. In a world where reliable online connections are needed for everything from health consultations to banking, it makes life very difficult.\n\n“It’s like we’re forgotten,” said Elaine Claxton, 70, an actor, as she pointed to the wires still broken and dangling next to a giant fallen tree on the lane leading to her home in Cucurrian. She has no broadband, no landline and the mobile signal is unreliable at best. Staying in touch with frail family members a few miles away has been fraught.\n\nHer sister, Shelley Claxton, 63, an animal trainer, said places such as Cucurrian were resilient. “When you’re as remote as we are, you have to be, but I think this storm shows us we need to do something different. Nature is whipping up more and more storms and we need to find ways of adapting to that.”\n\nOn the Lizard peninsula, the southernmost point of the British mainland, Sam Kirby, 53, described how the communication breakdown led to difficulties in working as a digital marketing consultant and in her volunteer role as a coastguard rescue officer.\n\nHer old-style copper landline meant the coastguard station officer could – just about – contact her by phone, but without broadband, working was challenging.\n\n“I had to go full digital nomad, which included time working in a supermarket car park with the car heater on, in the library, and basically perching anywhere I could to find wifi,” she said.\n\n“We’re constantly being told by those pushing Cornwall as a place to work that we’ve got to trade nationally or internationally, that we have the best broadband in the country, that we’re a booming digital economy. It’s hard to boom digitally when you can’t even get a text message out.”\n\nKirby and the people of Cucurrian are angry that Openreach, which builds and maintains the UK’s largest broadband network, has not restored services more quickly.\n\nThere is concern that the continuing switch from copper phone lines to full-fibre broadband makes them more vulnerable. “If this happens again next year, we won’t even have the copper landline so won’t have any link out at all,” said Kirby.\n\nIt is not just remote communities that have been hit. Karen Bennett, 72, lives close to Penzance town centre but a pine tree brought down a pole there, cutting off her broadband.\n\nA new pole has been put up but the broadband hasn’t returned, making her work as chair of the twinning association forging links between Penzance and the French town of Concarneau difficult. “We’ve had to find ways of working around it,” she said. “It’s frustrating. We still don’t know when the broadband will be back.”\n\nThese are interesting political and cultural times in Cornwall. The UK government has indicated that it will explore a bespoke devolution deal for Cornwall, possibly giving it more control over transport, housing and economic development.\n\nThis week the Cornish language – Kernewek – was officially recognised under part three of the European charter for regional or minority languages, which gives it greater protection and status.\n\nBut the loss of power, water and the continuing communications issues have made many Cornish people question whether the rest of the UK cares enough about the far-west of Britain, when it is not holidaying or visiting second homes there.\n\nLoveday Jenkin, a leading member of the political party Mebyon Kernow, which campaigns for greater self-government for Cornwall, said Goretti had exposed weaknesses in its infrastructure.\n\n“It shows Cornwall should have more devolved resilience money,” Jenkin said. “People want to treat Cornwall as a holiday playground. They need to recognise that there are people on the ground who have to manage it but don’t have the money.”\n\nJenkin spoke as yet another storm, named Ingrid by the Portuguese national weather service, brought in strong winds and heavy rain on Friday. “I think UK government needs to recognise Cornwall as the canary in the coalmine in relation to climate change,” Jenkin said. “There will be more storms coming.”\n\nOpenreach said it could not put a figure on how many people in Cornwall were still without broadband and rejected the idea that the switch to fibre made the county more vulnerable, arguing the outages were largely down to trees falling on overhead wires or taking down poles, which affected the copper and fibre network.\n\nA spokesperson said: “Storm Goretti has caused the worst impact to our network in Cornwall in recent memory and as soon as it was safe to do so, we’ve had teams of engineers working round the clock to repair the extensive damage.\n\n“We have managed to reconnect thousands of homes and businesses, but there is more to do and we know how frustrating that is. Unfortunately, the reality is that this type of repair work – closing roads, replacing poles and overhead cables – is complex and time-consuming.”\n\nThe recovery will take a long time. Alasdair Moore, the head of estate and gardens on Tresco, one of the Isles of Scilly, which lies 30 miles (48km) off the mainland and was battered by 99mph gusts during Goretti, said the effect was devastating.\n\nTrees fell, houses were damaged and the water supply interrupted. “The scale of the clear-up is huge,” said Moore. “It will be ongoing for a few years but the way the community and the team has responded has been magnificent.”\n\nMoore said remote communities such as those huddled on Scilly and west Cornwall always got on with it and came good. “Dealing with gales is very much part of this place’s history,” he said.",

    "title": "What to Do to Prepare Your House for This Weekend's Historic Winter Storm",
    "description": "You still have time to get ready for the potentially hazardous weather.",
    "fullText": "Ideally, a winter storm is merely uncomfortable and annoying, but they can sometimes be dangerous for you and your home. This weekend, a potentially historic winter storm is bearing down on some 200 million Americans, who may face dangerously icy conditions and significant snowfall. It's important to know your area's risk and understand the meaning and potential impact of different weather terms (advisory, watch, and warning) so you can respond quickly in the event of an emergency. You should also use the next few days to take steps to prepare your home and lower the chances of damage and danger.\n\nWinter prep starts with a thorough inspection of your property, both inside and out and top to bottom. Look for everything from roof leaks to door gaps to clogged gutters—anything that could lead to damage from snow, ice, and freezing temperatures. Make a plan for repairs and winterization to ensure your safety and comfort—not just for the next storm, but for the entire season.\n\nHere's a quick summary of the most important tasks to take care of before the temperatures drop or the snow starts to fall.\n\nThis is something that should be part of your regular home maintenance, and it's especially important when you are using your furnace and fireplace regularly (considering both fire safety and indoor air quality). Follow the Environmental Protection Agency's guidelines for where to install CO detectors and how to inspect and maintain them; then check out the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) guidelines for smoke alarms. Make sure your fire extinguisher is handy and working as well.\n\nAny thermostat will show you indoor temperature, and if you have a smart system like an Ecobee or Nest, you have real-time data at your fingertips. The CDC also recommends installing easy-to-read thermometers in locations where you'll see them frequently. This is especially important for older adults, as our sense of temperature changes as we age, increasing the risk of cold-related health issues.\n\nGaps around doors and windows keep your home drafty, which is uncomfortable and a waste of energy. Door sweeps, weatherstripping, and caulk can be used to fill spaces that allow cold air in. These are simple DIY fixes that go a long way toward lowering your heating bill and keeping your home warm. If your home has older windows, floor-to-ceiling thermal curtains can also help with insulation even if you lose heating.\n\nBefore freezing temperatures arrive, make sure your outdoor plumbing is prepared—frozen pipes can burst, causing significant damage to your home. To winterize exterior faucets, remove and store hoses, shut off outdoor water, drain spigots, close them up, and insulate with covers.\n\nWhile you don't need to fully winterize your indoor plumbing unless your house will be vacant for an extended period of time, you should look for pipes that are uninsulated and in or near unheated spaces and consider applying insulation sleeves or heat tape.\n\nTurn your furnace on and make sure it is working properly. Even if you don't need to heat your home right now, you don't want to scramble to schedule an emergency repair down the line when it's freezing outside. Look for common signs that your unit needs maintenance, such as unusual smells and noises, short cycling, and lack of actual heat. Replace your air filter as well.\n\nYour fireplace or wood stove can provide heat in an emergency. Like your furnace, they need seasonal maintenance to avoid chemical buildup and ensure proper venting, both of which impact your indoor air quality and overall safety. The NFPA recommends annual cleaning, which you can do yourself. However, if it's been awhile since your fireplace was professionally inspected and cleaned, consider scheduling a chimney sweep before you start your first winter fire. You can find one online or ask your local fire department for a recommendation.\n\nIf you get snow in your area, make sure your shovels are accessible and restock your ice melt. If you use a snowblower, give it a thorough inspection, replace any worn or damaged parts, change the oil, top it off with fresh gas, and start it up to make sure it runs.\n\nYou should be prepared for storms during any season with a stock of disaster supplies so you and your family (and pets) can survive without outside aid for a few days if needed. We have a guide to creating an emergency kit if you don't have one already, but you should also check all supplies and replenish anything that has been used or is missing. For winter, be sure you also have sleeping bags, warm blankets, and climate-appropriate changes of clothes and shoes available.",

    "fullText": "A major, widespread winter storm will lash much of the South, Midwest and Northeast on Friday, Jan. 23 through Monday, Jan. 26 with heavy snow likely for tens of millions of people from New Mexico to New England, according to Weather.com.\n\n\"It’s not hyperbole to call this storm a monster,\" said Washington Post meteorologist Ben Noll on X on Jan. 21. \"At its peak on Sunday (Jan. 25), 55 percent of all people in the United States are forecast to simultaneously experience snow, sleet or freezing rain. That’s more than half the population, at the same time,\" he said.\n\nWidespread travel disruptions are likely across the country this weekend, according to AccuWeather. \"Icy and snow-covered roads could force highway closures lasting for hours,\" said Jonathan Porter, AccuWeather chief meteorologist, in an e-mail to USA TODAY.\n\n\"Key east-to-west interstates that are critical for travel, commerce, and deliveries, including Interstates 20, 30, and 40, could experience closures around the same time, compounding challenges for travelers and supply chains.\"\n\nAs for snowfall totals, heavy snow of 6-12 inches is likely in the heart of the Plains, with over 2 feet possible in parts of the Appalachians, AccuWeather said in an online forecast.\n\nHow much snow falls in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast will depend on the storm's exact track, but a significant and plowable amount − likely up to or over a foot − is possible.\n\nThe heaviest snow, potentially up to a foot, is expected across central Oklahoma on Friday, Jan. 23 and Saturday, Jan. 24, according to AccuWeather. Lesser amounts, likely 3-6 inches, will fall in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, New Mexico and Texas.\n\nIn Arkansas, there is a 30-50% chance of exceeding 6 inches of snow over central and northern parts of the state, the weather service said. In Tennessee, the highest probabilities for at least 6 inches of snow favor areas north of Interstate 40, the weather service said.\n\nSnow, sleet and ice could sink even a bit farther south in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, while it picks up in Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, Virginia and parts of the Carolinas, said Weather.com meteorologist Jonathan Erdman in an online forecast.\n\nWintry precipitation will end in Texas, Oklahoma and the lower Mississippi Valley by midday Sunday, Jan. 25, but will persist from the Ohio Valley to the piedmont of Virginia and the Carolinas into the Northeast, according to Weather.com. Some areas of heavy snow are also possible in parts of the Ohio Valley.\n\nThe winter storm \"has the potential to bring widespread heavy snow to the mid-Atlantic and Northeast this weekend,\" according to Weather.com.\n\nMaps posted by Weather.com showed totals of as much as 2-3 feet of snow in southern Virginia, with widespread 1-2 feet across a wide swath of the Mid-Atlantic.\n\n\"Latest model trends show the higher snow totals shifting north into Washington, Baltimore and Philadelphia. The heaviest snow looks to fall Saturday night, Jan. 24 into Sunday, Jan. 25, making travel difficult to impossible. Snow may even linger across New England on Monday Jan. 26, depending on where the storm is positioned,\" Weather.com said.\n\nUpdate 01/21/2026 AM forecast for Winter Storm Fern.

    "fullText": "A major winter storm is forecast to bring heavy snow, sleet, freezing rain and frigid temperatures from Texas to Massachusetts through the weekend, according to meteorologists. It’s expected to affect more than 180 million Americans and could become one of the most significant storms of this winter season.\n\nMajor metro areas in the storm’s path include Dallas, Austin, Oklahoma City, Nashville, Atlanta, Charlotte, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City and Boston, forecasters say.\n\nImpacts from the snow and ice could cause power outages, widespread travel shutdowns and school closures. Following the storm, frigid temperatures will prolong the impacts of the snow and ice. “Potentially hundreds of thousands of people may go without electricity and heat for days,” AccuWeather chief meteorologist Jonathan Porter said.\n\nWinter storm watches have been issued for at least 70 million people from New Mexico to North Carolina and as far south as Texas, according to the National Weather Service. The agency advises people to “start preparations now for an impactful and prolonged winter storm.”\n\n“Expect heavy snow for the Southern Rockies and the south-central Plains eastward through the mid-Atlantic,” the weather service said. “Snow-covered roads and low visibility will cause widespread travel disruptions.”\n\nIn the Central Plains, 6 to 12 inches are forecast, with over 2 feet possible in parts of the Appalachians. Snow totals in the Northeast will depend on the storm's exact track, but a significant and plowable amount is possible, meteorologists say.\n\n“Broad swaths of freezing rain and sleet are expected south of the all-snow zone over the Southern Plains, Mid-South and Carolinas,” the NWS said. “Treacherous travel conditions, prolonged power outages and tree damage are likely.”\n\nIn the South, a thick glaze of ice will sweep across Texas to the Carolinas, which will weigh down trees and power lines.\n\nThe Plains will be impacted by snow, sleet and freezing rain by late morning or early afternoon, according to the Weather Channel. This includes parts of Kansas, Oklahoma and northern and western Texas and could extend as far east as western Tennessee and northern Mississippi.\n\nSnow, sleet and freezing rain could dip farther south in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi while the storm heads toward the Northeast, affecting Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and parts of the Carolinas.\n\nMore than 4,000 flight cancellations are to be expected nationwide this weekend due to the heavy snow and ice buildup, according to AccuWeather. School closures are also likely across multiple states as the storm lingers in some areas.",

The storm arriving late this week and into the weekend is shaping up to be a “widespread potentially catastrophic event from Texas to the Carolinas,” said Ryan Maue, a former chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

    "fullText": "ATLANTA (AP) — With many Americans still recovering from multiple blasts of snow and unrelenting freezing temperatures in the nation’s northern tier, a new storm is set to emerge this weekend that could coat roads, trees and power lines with devastating ice across a wide expanse of the South.\n\nThe storm arriving late this week and into the weekend is shaping up to be a “widespread potentially catastrophic event from Texas to the Carolinas,” said Ryan Maue, a former chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\n“I don’t know how people are going to deal with it,” he said.\n\nForecasters on Tuesday warned that the ice could weigh down trees and power lines, triggering widespread outages.\n\n“If you get a half of an inch of ice — or heaven forbid an inch of ice — that could be catastrophic,” said Keith Avery, CEO of the Newberry Electric Cooperative in South Carolina.\n\n‘Great swaths’ of heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain expected\n\nThe National Weather Service warned of \"great swaths of heavy snow, sleet, and treacherous freezing rain” starting Friday in much of the nation’s midsection and then shifting toward the East Coast through Sunday.\n\nTemperatures will be slow to warm in many areas, meaning ice that forms on roads and sidewalks might stick around, forecasters say.\n\nThe exact timing of the approaching storm — and where it is headed — remained uncertain on Tuesday. Forecasters say it can be challenging to predict precisely which areas could see rain and which ones could be punished with ice.\n\nCold air clashing with rain to fuel a 'major winter storm’\n\nAn extremely cold arctic air mass is set to dive south from Canada, setting up a clash with the cold temperatures and rain that will be streaming eastward across the southern U.S.\n\n“This is extreme, even for this being the peak of winter,” National Weather Service meteorologist Bryan Jackson said of the cold temperatures.\n\nWhen the cold air meets the rain, the likely result will be “a major winter storm with very impactful weather, with all the moisture coming up from the Gulf and encountering all this particularly cold air that’s spilling in,” Jackson said.\n\nAn atmospheric river could set up across the southern U.S.\n\nAn atmospheric river of moisture could be in place by the weekend, pulling precipitation across Texas and other states along the Gulf Coast and continuing across Georgia and the Carolinas, forecasters said.\n\n“Global models are painting a concerning picture of what this weekend could look like, with an increasingly strong signal for ice storm potential across North Georgia and portions of central Georgia,” according to the National Weather Service's Atlanta office.\n\nIf significant accumulations of ice strike metro Atlanta, it could be a problem through the weekend since low temperatures early Monday are expected to be around 22 degrees (minus 5.6 Celsius) in Atlanta. The city's high temperature on Monday is forecast to be around 35 degrees (1.7 Celsius).\n\nHighway and air travel could be tangled by the storm\n\nTravel is a major concern, as southern states have less equipment to remove snow and ice from roads, and extremely cold temperatures expected after the storm could prevent ice from melting for several days. In Michigan, more than 100 vehicles crashed into each other or slid off an interstate southwest of Grand Rapids on Monday.\n\nThe storm is also expected to impact many of the nation’s major hub airports, including those in Dallas; Atlanta; Memphis, Tennessee; and Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nPolar air from Canada to keep northern states in a deep freeze\n\nUnusually cold temperatures are already in place across much of the northern tier of the U.S., but the blast of arctic air expected later this week “will be the coldest yet,” Jackson said.\n\n“There’s a large sprawling vortex of low pressure centered over Hudson Bay,” Jackson said of the sea in northern Canada that’s connected to the Arctic Ocean. “And this is dominating the weather over all of North America.”\n\nTexas could be a harbinger for other parts of the South\n\nSome of the storm’s earliest impacts could be in Texas on Friday, as the arctic air mass slides south through much of the state, National Weather Service forecaster Sam Shamburger said in a briefing on the storm.\n\n“At the same time, we’re expecting rain to move into much of the state,” Shamburger said.\n\nLow temperatures could fall into the 20s or even the teens in parts of Texas by Saturday, with the potential for a wintery mix of weather in the northern part of the state.\n\nForecasters cautioned that significant uncertainty remains, particularly over how much ice or snow could fall across north and central Texas.\n\n“It’s going to be a very difficult forecast,” Shamburger said.\n\nAt an Arkansas hardware store, customers gear up for storm\n\nIn Little Rock, Arkansas, a steady stream of customers on Tuesday were stocking up on supplies at Fuller and Son Hardware.\n\n“Right now parents of young children are getting sleds,” said James Carter, the company’s director of operations.\n\nPeople were also getting shovels, ice-melting products and covers for outside faucets to keep them from freezing, since low temperatures in the Little Rock area are forecast to fall into the teens, he said.\n\nPanjwani reported from Washington.

The final totals will depend on the storm’s track and intensity, which are still uncertain with four days to go.\n\nFOX 29 Meteorologist Kathy Orr said both American and European weather models are predicting a significant snow event, with the potential for 6 to 12 inches of fluffy, fast-accumulating snow due to the expected cold temperatures in the teens over the weekend.\n\nPennDOT told FOX 29 that crews will be out pre-treating roads and working throughout the storm if it arrives this weekend.\n\nPlymouth Township and other communities in Montgomery County are scrambling to secure enough road salt, with deliveries delayed and supplies running low, however.\n\nChris Loschiavo, director of public works for Plymouth Township told FOX 29 that he's hoping to receive 500 tons worth of new salt shipments before the snow hits.\n\nFirst responders in Chester and Montgomery counties told FOX 29 that they've already seen an uptick in calls related to icy sidewalks and driveways following the last snowfall, with untreated areas turning into sheets of ice overnight.\n\nResidents are urged to salt steps, driveways and sidewalks and to watch for black ice, especially as temperatures remain below freezing.\n\nPECO recommends residents fully charge cell phones before a storm, have flashlights with fresh batteries on each floor and prepare food and bottled water in case of a power outage.\n\nAnyone who experiences a power outage or sees downed wires should call 1-800-841-4141 right away.\n\nResidents are also reminded to check on neighbors, especially the elderly or those with limited mobility, and to stay off the roads if conditions worsen.\n\nUtility companies and local agencies are preparing for the possibility of more snow and potential power outages.\n\n\"We’re actively monitoring the weather,\" PECO Spokesperson Candice Womer told FOX 29. \"We also have additional crews on standby to restore any outages that may occur during these types of temperatures.\"\n\nInformation in this article was sourced from the National Weather Service, the FOX 29 Weather Team and FOX 29 reporters Jennifer Lee and Kelly Rule.",

Here’s the outlook for the days ahead.\n\nWe will have sunny skies today with highs near 40 degrees, and skies remain clear overnight. Lows will dip to near 20 degrees in the Triad with mid-to-upper teens in outlying areas.\n\nHigh pressure is forecast to sweep across the southeastern U.S., and, as it slips eastward, temperatures are going to warm up. Highs are expected to return to the mid-40s on Wednesday with partly cloudy skies. The warmest day of the week is Thursday, when we will have partly cloudy skies and highs in the mid-50s.\n\nSnow lovers will like the weekend forecast as the potential for wintry weather increases.\n\nOn Friday, we are expecting scattered showers with highs returning to the mid-40s. A massive dome of Arctic high pressure is moving across the Great Lakes region on Friday as well, eventually becoming planted in New England by Saturday. This is the perfect location for deep, cold air to be pumped down the leeward side of the Appalachians into the Piedmont. A coastal low is forecast to be pulled northward, which will provide a continuing steady fetch of Atlantic moisture into the Piedmont.\n\nThis is a very fluid situation with models coming to varying outcomes. At this point, rain will change over to snow Friday night and is expected to continue as snow on Saturday (90%). Snow, at times mixed with sleet, will continue on Sunday (60%). It’s too early to project precipitation amounts but it looks like we are facing a significant winter storm. Highs will be in the upper-20s on Saturday, and mid-20s on Sunday, with lows in the teens.\n\nThis potential winter weather event is still five days away and we guarantee details will change. Please make plans in case travel isn’t favorable this weekend and stay tuned!\n\nBitterly cold conditions persist into the beginning of the new work week. If we have snow lingering on the ground, temperatures will be colder than the current forecast, but for now, we have temperatures staying at or below freezing through Monday with partly cloudy skies.",

    "description": "Amid severe geomagnetic storm conditions, the northern lights could be visible from even more states on Jan. 19",
    "fullText": "A strong geomagnetic storm could spark auroras in up to 24 U.S. states overnight Monday, Jan. 19, into early Tuesday, Jan. 20, according to NOAA forecasts\n\nAn Earth-directed coronal mass ejection from an X1.9 solar flare is expected to impact Earth’s magnetic field, potentially triggering G3 to G4 storm conditions\n\nClear skies following the new moon could make this event especially photogenic, with cameras capturing colors not visible to the naked eye\n\nLook up, because the sky’s about to put on a show!\n\nIf you’ve ever wanted to witness the northern lights without leaving the U.S., this could be your moment.\n\nThe aurora borealis (northern lights) is caused by geomagnetic storms, which occur when charged particles from the sun collide with gases in Earth's atmosphere, creating brilliant waves of light in the sky. Still, their visibility depends on several factors, including intensity and location.\n\nA surge of intense solar activity arrives just in time for January’s dark winter skies, setting the stage for auroras to push unusually far south across the country tonight, Jan. 19 and into the early hours of Tuesday, Jan. 20, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center.\n\nThis isn’t a subtle glow reserved for the Arctic Circle. This is a rare, high-impact space weather event that could bring auroras to mid-latitude regions just as the night sky reaches its darkest point.\n\nAccording to NOAA forecasters, Earth is bracing for a strong to potentially severe geomagnetic storm as charged solar particles slam into our planet’s magnetic field.\n\nThe trigger? A massive X1.9-class solar flare erupted from the sun, followed by an Earth-directed full halo (CME) coronal mass ejection, the kind that significantly increases the odds of intense auroral activity.\n\nThis is one of those nights where space weather, the lunar cycle and winter darkness conspire to create something extraordinary.\n\nHere’s exactly when to look, where to look and how to make the most of this stellar event.\n\nThe northern lights are expected overnight Monday, Jan. 19, into early Tuesday, Jan. 20, as Earth is impacted by a powerful geomagnetic storm.\n\nForecasters are predicting strong G3 conditions, with the potential for the storm to intensify to G4 (severe) on NOAA’s five-level scale.\n\nThis activity is being driven by a full-halo coronal mass ejection (CME), a massive cloud of charged solar particles released after an X1.9-class solar flare erupted from the sun on Sunday, Jan. 18.\n\nGiven that the CME is directed towards Earth, it has a higher chance of disturbing its magnetic field once it arrives. According to NOAA, “Higher storm levels are possible as early as the end of the day” on Mondaym Jan. 19.\n\nIf conditions peak as forecasted, auroras could be visible across up to 24 U.S. states, extending from the Canadian border down into mid-latitude regions.\n\nThe best chances of viewing will be in northern areas, including Alaska, Northern Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, North and South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, New York and Maine.\n\nIf the storm reaches G3 strength or higher, however, sighting could stretch further south into Oregon, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont and New Hampshire.\n\nSpace weather is notoriously difficult to predict, as everything depends on the speed and orientation of the solar wind.\n\nFor real-time updates, be sure to monitor NOAA’s 30-minute aurora forecast, SpaceWeatherLive.com or aurora-tracking apps such as Aurora Now, My Aurora Forecast, SpaceWeatherLive or Glendale Aurora.\n\nOne key indicator is the Bz component of the interplanetary magnetic field. When Bz turns southward, solar energy can more easily penetrate Earth’s magnetosphere. A sustained southward Bz of -5 nanoteslas or stronger often signals an imminent auroral display.\n\nDark skies will be especially favorable during this window, as the activity follows a new moon, meaning little to no moonlight to interfere with visibility.\n\nFrom northern U.S. states, any auroras that appear may glow low along the northern horizon.\n\nThe best part about the northern lights is that you can also make fun memories in the process. Your smartphone is more than enough, too! All you have to do is go to settings, turn on Night Mode and point your camera lens towards the sky.\n\nIf you’re a more seasoned skywatcher and happen to have a DSLR or mirrorless camera, grab a tripod and set your camera to manual mode. Don’t forget to stay warm!",

    "fullText": "Manchester City Women made light work of Bournemouth as they cruised into the fifth round of the FA Cup. Bunny Shaw opened the scoring before three goals in four minutes from Lauren Hemp and a double by Laura Coombs, sent City in 4-0 up at the interval. Vivianne Miedema got on the scoresheet with a second-half brace as Andree Jeglertz’ side extended their unbeaten run to 16 games in all competitions.\n\nCity had struggled last weekend against Everton in their first match after the international break, but ultimately came away with a 2-0 victory to remain top of the WSL. But there were no such problems against the National League South side, although the Cherries did pose City some problems at the start, with Jenna Markham trying her luck, with Khiara Keating saving well.\n\nCity then began to show their WSL quality and it was no surprise when Bunny Shaw headed the Blues in front in the 19th minute. Leila Ouahabi’s brilliant cross into the box was perfect for Shaw, and the Jamaican powered home a header to give City the lead.\n\nThe Blues continued to press but Bournemouth, despite being a goal down, were holding their own, and they would have been happy going into the break just a goal down. However, a flurry of goals in the space of four minutes ended any hopes of a comeback. Lauren Hemp drilled into the bottom right corner, before Coombs hit a two-minute brace to effectively put the Blues into the fifth round.\n\nMiedema got in on the act in the 58th minute, soon after Yui Hasegawa thundered a shot against the bar, tapping into an empty net thanks to a fortuitous deflection off Lily Murphy. The Dutch striker then put the Cherries to bed and one on the cake as she thumped home in the 85th minute.\n\nIn the end it was a routine victory for Jeglertz’s side and City will now go into their League Cup Tie with Chelsea on Wednesday full of confidence and eager to test themselves against the current WSL champions, in preparation for their upcoming tussle in the WSL at the beginning of February.\n\nFinal Score: Bournemouth Women 0-6 Manchester City Women",

    "fullText": "The Red Storm defied odds last season, winning the Big East regular-season championship and their first Big East Tournament title since 2000. But this year has been a different story. Rick Pitino’s side are 12–5 to start the season, they’ve fallen out of the rankings, and that comes with consequences.\n\nSt. John’s parted ways with general manager Matt Abdelmassih. He was long considered one of the most important figures behind St. John’s roster construction and transfer portal strategy. Abdelmassih had been on administrative leave since mid-December. According to journalist Roger Rubin of Newsday Sports, financial deals made by the General Manager had been under investigation in recent weeks, prompting his exit from the program.\n\nWhen Rick Pitino was asked about the situation, he had a rather cold response. “It’s out of my hands. I found out tonight. All I was told four days ago is look for another general manager. They said to me, ‘ don’t ask any questions.’ I said, ‘Okay, I’ll look for one.’ So, it’s really not a big deal,” Pitino said after the win against Marquette.\n\nHe continued, “What’s a big deal is making sure that we don’t lose anything. But that’s a university decision. I’ll abide by. They didn’t ask me my opinion, and I didn’t give it because they didn’t, and in their defense, they didn’t want to bother me. They didn’t want to distract me right now, and I appreciate that.”\n\nThe post Rick Pitino Offers Cold Reality Check After St. John’s Parts Ways With GM Abdelmassih appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "description": "Maddow taunted President Donald Trump over a series of recent failures and rebukes from courts and even some Republicans on a variety of issues.",
    "fullText": "MS NOW host Rachel Maddow taunted President Donald Trump over a series of recent failures and rebukes from courts and even some Republicans on a variety of issues.\n\nThe second term of Trump’s presidency has seen a steady erosion of support over issues like the Epstein files and rebukes from federal courts over a raft of policies. But those rebukes have picked up pace recently.\n\nOn Monday night’s edition of MS NOW’s The Rachel Maddow Show, the host ticked through the latest of them. She then gloated that Trump “is losing all the time and everywhere now”:\n\nYou might not have seen the headline today that today a federal court blocked the Trump administration from cutting energy funding just for blue states. This is billions of dollars Congress appropriated for clean energy projects of various kinds all over the country.\n\nTrump administration decided, and they admitted this — they decided that just in blue states, just in states that didn’t vote for Trump, they would cut all of that funding. They’d leave the funding in place in states that voted for Trump. They would cut it in states that didn’t vote for Trump.\n\nA federal court today ruled that that is illegal and stopped the Trump administration from doing that. That ruling today came after another federal court today stopped Trump from shutting down a big offshore wind farm in Rhode Island and Connecticut. Trump’s shutdown of that project, according to the courts today, was also illegal.\n\nAnd so, yet another federal court blocked Trump on that as well. So that work on the wind farm will be able to go ahead. Both of those rulings today follow.\n\nLast night, yet another federal court blocking Trump, this time from cutting funding to the American academy of pediatrics. This is a doctor’s group of pediatricians group that criticized the flock of ducks level insane quackery at Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services under RFK Jr.\n\nTrump responded by canceling federal grants for the American Academy of Pediatrics. A judge has now ruled that that was illegal retaliation. And so, Trump is blocked from doing that. That funding has to be reinstated.\n\nThat ruling comes after another federal judge just blocked Trump from cutting off federal election funds to states in retaliation for them not changing their election rules in ways that Trump wants. The judge said, quote, “the Constitution assigns no authority to the president over federal election administration.” And so, Trump got blocked on that one, too.\n\nShall I keep going? I could keep going. Another federal court just blocked Trump from freezing billions of dollars for childcare and social services for kids, again, in Democratic run states, as some kind of punishment against those states for electing Democrats, punishing them for that by cutting off the temporary assistance to needy families program.\n\nBecause, you know, you know, what would Jesus do? Trump was also just blocked from a — from doing that by yet another federal court.\n\nIt`s almost like he is losing all the time and everywhere now. There may still be people in America who are shocked that Trump keeps breaking the law over and over again, blatantly and insistently. The courts no longer appear to be shocked by that, and the courts now are just telling him no very bluntly, every single day, and often multiple times a day.\n\nAnd it’s not even just the courts, as I know you are aware, last week in one 48-hour stretch, we had a Senate vote for a War Powers resolution to block Trump from any further military adventurism. In Venezuela, five Republican senators crossed over to side with Democrats to pass that War Powers resolution. It was enough to advance that it’s going to get another vote in the Senate this week.\n\nThat came right on the heels of 17 Republicans in the House breaking ranks with Trump and siding with Democrats on the Affordable Care Act to try to, at least temporarily, undo the disastrous decision Trump and Republicans made in their so-called big beautiful bill. The decision to send tens of thousands of American families’ health insurance rates through the roof.\n\nSeventeen Republicans crossed over, defied Trump and joined with Democrats to pass that health care matter in the House.\n\nNow it`s going to come to the senate. Trump is now whining about how he might have to veto it if and when it passes in the senate as well, because he definitely wants to make sure that people’s health insurance premiums double or triple in cost for nothing other than something that he personally did. He apparently wants that.\n\nI mean, what we’ve just seen in Congress is one of the worst rebukes Trump has had from congressional Republicans since he has been back in office this whole disastrous year.\n\nWatch above via MS NOW’s The Rachel Maddow Show.\n\nThe post MS NOW’s Rachel Maddow Taunts Trump Over Blizzard of Defeats: ‘Losing All the Time and Everywhere!’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nMeredith Whitney earned her “Oracle of Wall Street” nickname by predicting the 2008 financial crisis before it hit. Now, nearly two decades later, she sees fresh trouble brewing — this time, in the U.S. housing market.\n\n“The housing market is gummed up with existing home sales on track in 2025 to be their slowest in more than 25 years,” Whitney wrote in a piece for the Financial Times (1). “The next few years may not be much better.”\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nGet early access to privately-held AI companies with Fundrise Venture Capital for as little as $10. Join 350,000+ investors today\n\nThe problem is tied to demographic shifts. Whitney reports that over 54% of homes in the U.S. are owned by seniors — 10% more than in 2008. Most of them own their homes outright, meaning they’re mortgage-free. According to property brokerage platform Redfin, 78% of seniors want to remain in their current home rather than downsize (2).\n\nIn an interview with Marketwatch earlier this year, Whitney said, “Either these folks have no mortgage, or a small mortgage, and the capital gains that they have to take and the costs that are required to move are prohibitive (3).”\n\nHere’s how this is affecting boomers and America’s housing supply.\n\nWhitney added that the potential tax bite from selling your home means baby boomers may not be as wealthy as they think.\n\nAfter selling your primary residence, the IRS allows you to deduct up to $250,000 from the home’s selling price (or $500,000 for joint filers) to reduce your capital gains liability (4). Given that this threshold was set in 1997, it’s not nearly as helpful now as it was when home prices were far lower.\n\nWhitney is not the only one raising red flags.\n\nLast September, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said that the housing market is “in part frozen” with many homeowners reluctant to sell because they’re locked in at lower mortgage rates (5). These rates date back to the pandemic, which were between 0% and 0.25% according to Brookings (6).\n\nThe result? Persistently high prices combined with elevated interest rates, which can render homeownership harder than ever to achieve.\n\nAccording to Realtor.com, the typical U.S. household earned roughly 46% less than what’s recommended to afford a $439,950 home, which was the median list price for an American home as of July (7). In December, the median price of a home had dropped to $415,000, meaning that prices had improved — but not by much (8).",

    "description": "Is the US labor market in the calm before the storm? Economists say the Beveridge curve is the signal to watch.",
    "fullText": "Is the US labor market in the calm before the storm?\n\nOne model that's closely followed by academics but which tends to fly under the radar for most investors suggests that could be the case — and it's spooking some economists.\n\nWhile the December nonfarm payrolls report, released on Friday, showed that the US added 50,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.4% from 4.5%, the so-called Beveridge curve indicates that the labor market could be on the verge of a quick deterioration.\n\nThe Beveridge curve considers the relationship between the unemployment rate and the number of job openings relative to the amount of overall jobs (the job vacancy rate) over the course of a multi-year labor market cycle. As the job vacancy rate continues to fall, signaling it's more difficult to find work, the unemployment rate eventually reaches a tipping point and begins to rise sharply.\n\nUsing 2022 or 2023 as the top of the most recent labor cycle — when the job vacancy rate was around its peak — we can see that conditions are ripe for unemployment to trend upward, and the job vacancy rate has dropped to 4.6%.\n\nThe current cycle is shown in teal dots in the chart below, shared in December by Neil Dutta, the chief US economist at Renaissance Macro Research, who is warning that downside risks to the labor market are higher than upside risks for inflation.\n\nSo far, both hiring and layoff rates have been low, allowing unemployment to stay range-bound. But if layoffs were to increase, the scarce number of jobs on the market could put the economy into trouble.\n\nMatt Bush, US economist at Guggenheim Investments, which oversees more than $357 billion in assets, told Business Insider on Friday that while he thinks the labor market will remain intact in the months ahead, the prospect of rising unemployment is still a threat that investors should be paying attention to.\n\n\"I would say that recession risk is still probably well above normal, given this fragility in the labor market,\" Bush said. \"Because hiring is so low right now, it wouldn't take a big increase in layoffs to see unemployment rise pretty meaningfully.\"\n\nHe continued: \"So because of that, any even somewhat small shock to business confidence could see a pick up in layoffs and a pretty quick and sharp rise in the unemployment rate. It's not our base case, but it is a key risk that we're watching.\"\n\nPeter Berezin, the chief global strategist at BCA Research, recently expressed his concern around another indicator closely tied with the Beveridge curve: the ratio of jobs to workers. It is now negative, meaning there are more workers than there are total jobs (filled or not).\n\n\"The US labor market has reached a critical threshold: The jobs-workers gap has turned negative, signalling that the economy has reached the flat side of the Beveridge curve,\" Berezin wrote in a LinkedIn post. \"A further decline in job openings could push it into recession.\"\n\nThere are other signs that labor market conditions are set to worsen. The unemployment rate recently ticked above its three-month moving average, which has only occurred before or during recessions dating back to the 1940s.\n\nThe Conference Board's \"labor differential\" measure, which compares the number of survey respondents who say jobs are \"plentiful\" versus \"hard to get,\" is also trending higher. The metric tends to move alongside the unemploymnet rate.\n\nBut for now, at least, investors can take solace in Friday's steady unemployment number despite a relatively low print of 50,000 jobs added, Bush said.\n\n\"It's reassuring that we're not seeing this spiral where lower job growth leads to lower spending and that leads to further layoffs and that sort of recessionary snowball effect,\" Bush said. \"And I think it's because labor supply is also cooling alonside labor demand.\"",

    "fullText": "America’s distilleries have faced a perfect storm of economic and market headwinds that has pushed many out of business in recent years.\n\nFirst, many Americans are drinking less, especially younger ones.\n\n\"Young adults in the U.S. have become progressively less likely to use alcohol over the past two decades, with the percentages of 18- to 34-year-olds saying they ever drink, that they drank in the past week and that they sometimes drink more than they shouldall lower today. At the same time, drinking on all three metrics has trended up among older Americans while holding fairly steady among middle-aged adults,\" according to a Gallup poll.\n\n62% of adults under age 35 say they drink, down from 72% two decades ago.\n\nConversely, drinking has increased among adults aged 55 and older.\n\nYoung adults are also drinking less frequently and are less likely to drink to excess.\n\nIn addition, distilleries continue to feel the effects of tariffs imposed during President Donald Trump’s administration, which have increased production costs and contributed to a sharp drop in U.S. whiskey exports to key markets like the EU.\n\n“We’re very worried about what tariffs could do to our industry,” said Eric Gregory, president of the Kentucky Distillers Association, reported WKYT.\n\nTake those two challenges together, and it's not surprising that American distilleries, including Artisan Distillery & Craft Bar, have decided to close their doors.\n\nThose impacts are already being felt.\n\nAmerican Whiskey exports to the EU, the U.S. spirits industry’s largest export market, have tumbled by 33% and cost $300 million since the EU’s 25% retaliatory tariff went into effect on June 22, 2018, according to a new report released by the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States on the two-year anniversary.\n\nThe EU levied the destructive tariff in response to U.S. tariffs on EU steel and aluminum.\n\n“American distillers enjoyed two decades of unparalleled growth in the EU prior to the implementation of these retaliatory tariffs,” said Chris Swonger, CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS). “This report makes clear that these tariffs took the wind out of the sails for American Whiskey exports to our top export market, which has resulted in a loss of more than a quarter of a billion dollars of sales.”\n\nArtisan Distillery & Craft Bar became famous for its Spike Vodka, a spirit made with nopal instead of the traditional fermented cereal grains or potatoes. Later, the distillery added gin, whisky, moonshine, and a tequila-like agave liquor and branched out to brewing beer.",

For a few years after its release, it seemed like every major video game publisher wanted to copy Blizzard's formula (and monthly subscription-based revenue), and MMORPGs became a hot new genre.\n\nUnfortunately, few of the games that chased WoW's success found much of their own. Publishers soured on the genre before too long, resulting in a draught of new MMORPGs over the last decade when compared to other popular game genres (even if many of them, like some of the best survival games or multiplayer shooters, now borrow heavily from MMORPGs). As a result, many of the most popular games MMORPGs today are the same titles that were popular in the early-mid 2000s. Some have existed for decades and require subscriptions to play, even as others have more recently shifted to a free-to-play model.\n\nThere's never been a better time to get lost in a living, breathing online world, something only the best MMORPGs can provide. Below you'll find a list, in no particular order, of some of the top MMORPGs to play in 2026, ranging from tried-and-true classics of the genre to hybrids that combine the best of traditional fantasy-themed MMOs with elements of shooters, space exploration, and more. Some of the games below also happen to be some of the best free-to-play games available.\n\nBlizzard might not have invented the MMORPG, but it certainly popularized it, as it took a genre known for having a steep learning curve and made it more approachable than ever before with streamlined mechanics, punchy combat, instanced dungeons and raids, and its signature level of polish. As a result, WoW is still going strong today and remains one of the best PC MMORPGs to play, having received nine expansions to date (with a 10th on the way). In WoW, players choose a faction--the Alliance or the Horde--as well as a race and class, and from there embark on an adventure to defend the fantasy world of Azeroth from all manner of threats. Each of the game's 13 classes feels distinct, with multiple sub-classes to choose from, and there's an ever-expanding list of fantasy races to play as and customize.\n\nWoW celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2024, as Blizzard kicked-off a three-expansion storyline called The Worldsoul Saga with the release of the game's excellent and approachable The War Within expansion. Blizzard celebrated WoW's big anniversary by dropping some big news as well--after two decades, WoW will finally receive player housing as part of its next expansion, and in a recent preview made clear that unlike in some MMOs, housing in WoW will be available for everyone.\n\nWhile the main version of WoW has continued to evolve over the last 20 years, a large and vocal contingent of fans yearned for the early days of the MMO, before more-recent expansions forever transformed the game's world and Blizzard updated much of its visuals, gameplay, and classes. Blizzard finally listened in 2019 with the release of WoW Classic, a return to the game's earliest, pre-expansion days.\n\nWoW Classic's release proved to be a huge success, and Blizzard now offers multiple different flavors of old-school WoW all under one subscription price, one that also grants access to the modern version of WoW. Players can still check out the 2004-era version of Azeroth (which received new servers to start fresh on in November 2024 for the game's 20th anniversary), or move forward in time and play one of the game's older expansions, like 2010's Cataclysm (soon to be 2012's Mists of Pandaria). There are even seasonal servers, like the still ongoing Season of Discovery, which adds new items, raid content, and class changes to the original version of Blizzard's genre-defining title.\n\nSince the genre's inception, many MMORPGs have featured familiar sword-and-sorcery trappings. It only makes sense then that the granddaddy of the modern fantasy genre, The Lord of the Rings, was a prime candidate to get the MMO treatment following the massive success of WoW. Enter The Lord of the Rings Online, a game that couldn't have come from a more veteran MMORPG team, with developer Turbine having been responsible for MMO classics like 1999's Asheron's Call and its sequel. The Lord of the Rings Online has since changed developers, but its current developer, Standing Stone Games, is composed of many former Turbine developers. Better yet, it still receives new content updates and expansions, with its most recent, Legacy of Morgoth, having arrived in November 2024.\n\nThough very much following in the footsteps of WoW, it fittingly places a much larger emphasis on story than Blizzard's MMO and delivers a painstakingly detailed version of JRR Tolkien's Middle-earth for players to explore and immerse themselves in.\n\nFinal Fantasy is one of the biggest RPG franchises of all time, and as such has not one, but two MMORPGs to its name. Though 2002's Final Fantasy XI is still playable, it's Square Enix's more-recent MMO, Final Fantasy XIV, that has blossomed into one of the best MMORPGs of all time. When it was first released, it was a critical and commercial failure. But several years and many updates later, the game was re-released as Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, completely reworking many of the original game's systems, story, and structure. Now, Final Fantasy XIV is one of the top MMORPG games today and one of the best PS5 and Xbox MMORPGs available, having long been playable on PlayStation and more recently launching on Xbox Series X|S.\n\nIts flexible job system means players don't need to create a new character every time they want to try a new role, and despite being a MMORPG with a massive shared world to explore, its main story, over-the-top boss battles, and excellent music all deliver on what RPG fans expect from a game sharing the Final Fantasy name. Its latest expansion, Dawntrail, released in July 2024.\n\nFuncom is no stranger to MMORPGs, having previously made titles like Anarchy Online and Age of Conan. The studio's latest foray into the genre is its most ambitious yet, adapting author Frank Herbert's sci-fi Dune saga into a massive survival MMORPG where players battle to survive on the harsh desert world of Arakkis. Dune: Awakening is definitely a survival game first and foremost, with players needing to gather resources, manage their water levels, build shelter, and advance their gear to progress.\n\nHowever, MMO staples like faction reputation, class-skill trees, open-world dungeons, and a massive, ever-changing endgame PvP zone that brings together hundreds of players also firmly make Dune: Awakening a MMORPG. Its unique mix of third-person shooting, melee, and vehicular combat helps to further distinguish it from the many fantasy-themed MMOs on the market, making for an enticing combination of genres, gameplay, and aesthetics. Just keep in mind that getting killed by one of the desert's massive sandworms means losing everything on your character at that moment--the desert claims the weak.\n\nOne of the first big new MMORPGs in years, Amazon's New World made quite a splash when it released in 2021, breaking concurrent player records on Steam. The hype has since died down quite a bit, but New World is still an extremely solid MMORPG that received a major overhaul on PC and launched on consoles in the form of New World: Aeternum in October 2024. In New World: Aeternum, players wash up the mysterious island from which the game takes its name, one that has trapped various civilizations and explorers from throughout human history. From there they join one of three different factions, each with their own idea of what to do with the mystical land they now call home. Instead of classes, players instead can equip two different weapon types, which define what skills can be used and what stats a player may want to strive for when gearing their character.\n\nThe New World: Aeternum update bundled in the game's sole expansion, and in the process significantly reworked much of the game's story and its early-game questing, two of its biggest weaknesses prior to the update. Amazon also recently debuted seasonal servers that change up New World: Aeternum's normal gameplay in major ways, ranging from servers that put a heavy focus on open-world PvP to \"hardcore\" servers with faster progression where the goal is to never die even once.\n\nThe developer behind the Halo series took many of the ideas popularized in MMORPGs like WoW--dungeons, raids, classes, special abilities, color-coated loot--and applied it to a smaller-scale, sci-fi FPS. The result was Destiny and its sequel, Destiny 2. Bungie has proven it's still king when it comes to making a great-feeling shooter, and it never gets old blasting ancient aliens or genocidal robots with all manner of Destiny's 2 powerful Exotic weapons. When combined with the social elements of MMOs like shared worlds to explore, larger-scale public events, and multiplayer dungeons and raids filled with complex puzzles and mechanics, Destiny 2 forms an impressive genre cocktail that can be hard to put down.\n\nEverything Bungie has been building towards for over a decade may have culminated in 2024's The Final Shape expansion, but Destiny 2 is still receiving new updates and expansions, with the new Edge of Fate expansion releasing July 15. Destiny 2 is also widely available, making it both one of the best cross-platform games to play with friends and one of the best PS5 and Xbox MMORPG games out there.\n\nGuild Wars 2 was a breath of fresh air when it released in 2012, and for good reason. It put a new spin on many of the tried-and-true tropes and systems seen in popular MMORPGs like WoW, with an emphasis on open-world content. Combined with its flashy movement, impressive visuals compared to many other MMOs, and engaging combat that combines class skills with unique weapon abilities, Guild Wars 2 still stands out from the competition as one of the top MMORPG games available on PC.\n\nIn 2025, Guild Wars 2 is still regularly receiving new updates and expansions, in part thanks to a recent restructuring of how developer ArenaNet develops new content. Its latest expansion, Janthir Wilds, introduced several new big features, including player housing and the spear weapon-type. Unlike many of the biggest MMORPGs, Guild Wars 2 doesn't require a subscription to play, making it an appealing choice for aspiring MMO players on a budget.\n\nOne of the more popular Korean MMORPGs, Lost Ark came to the West with the help of Amazon Games and quickly set itself apart thanks to its isometric perspective and lack of a box price or mandatory subscription fee. In Lost Ark, players choose a class and then embark on a quest to discover the titular lost Arks scattered throughout the fantasy world of Arkesia. It's a journey that takes players to both huge, story-heavy new continents and to small, one-off islands that are home to some truly fun minigame events, all which players sail to on their own personal boat.\n\nSprinkle in some truly fantastic endgame raids and impressive Monster Hunter-like boss battles, and Lost Ark is well worth playing for those looking for a MMORPG that plays closer to some of the best Diablo-like games than it does WoW, albeit minus the fountains of loot. Three years later, the game is still receiving frequent updates, with a new class, the shapeshifting Wildsoul, debuting in February 2025.\n\nFallout 76 didn't exactly have a smooth start in 2018, with players criticizing it for a laundry list of bugs, performance issues, lack of NPC characters, and more. But Bethesda never gave up on its multiplayer Fallout experiment, and in 2025, Fallout 76 is a great way to experience one of gaming's best RPG universes alongside dozens of other players.\n\nLike traditional Fallout games, players scrounge their way through an apocalyptic wasteland on the hunt for supplies and gear. Unlike single-player entries in the franchise, however, dozens of players in Fallout 76 can team up to fend off waves of Super Mutants, battle massive monsters as part of the game's numerous public events, or even drop nukes on one another. Bethesda added Expeditions to the list of things to do in Fallout 76 back in 2022. These allow players to team up and venture outside the game's Appalachian Wasteland to other scenic locales, like Fallout 3's The Pitt, for dungeon-like missions, further giving the FPS RPG a distinct MMO flavor.\n\nFallout 76 has seen a resurgence in interest thanks to the launch of the TV show adaptation, making this a great time to jump in. Its most recent content update, Gone Fission, added fishing as a new activity, with players able to complete various fishing-themed quests and upgrade their fishing pole to tackle new challenges. For more on the franchise, check out our look at the best Fallout games.\n\nStar Wars: The Old Republic will feel familiar to anyone who has played WoW but is no less worthy a time investment for those looking to dive deeper into the Star Wars universe. Originally developed by BioWare, a studio known for its RPG storytelling, Star Wars: The Old Republic unsurprisingly puts its story front and center, with dialogue wheels, fully voiced characters, and impactful narrative choices that feel right at home in a single-player RPG. It also features unique storylines for each of the game's eight classes, meaning there is plenty of replay value for players who can't make up their mind on which class to play. As much as it emulates WoW in its gameplay, Star Wars: The Old Republic does include features that have yet to come to Blizzard's MMO, including player housing and NPC companions.\n\nThough the game recently changed developers (with some former members of BioWare joining Broadsword, which also oversees classic MMORPGs owned by EA like Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot), it still receives new story content and events, making it the top MMORPG game for Star Wars fans and one of the best Star Wars games of all time.\n\nWhile it may still be quite some time until The Elder Scrolls 6, those longing for a return to Tamriel will find plenty to enjoy in The Elder Scrolls Online, which celebrated its 10th anniversary last year. The MMORPG spin on Bethesda's popular RPG series will feel familiar to those who have played single-player entries in the franchise, with the ability to play in first or third-person, NPC companions, various guilds to join, options to steal from NPCs, and more. Players choose an assortment of skills both from their chosen weapon and armor type but also their class in order to make unique builds that can be used to conquer dungeons and raids with other players. Compared to other, more-traditional MMORPGs playable on consoles, its smaller number of skills and easy-to-read user interface make ESO one of the top Xbox and PS5 MMORPG games, even if it sadly doesn't support cross-play or cross-progression across platforms.\n\nIn 2025, developer ZeniMax Online is making some big changes to ESO's content schedule. It's forgoing the yearly expansion model used for almost a decade and instead focusing on smaller, more frequent seasonal updates that will help to deliver on efforts to improve the game across the board. Those efforts include major experiments like Cyrodiil Champions meant to improve the MMO's open-world PvP and a renewed focus on the new and returning player experience. Its current season, Seasons of the Worm Cult, continues the base game's main storyline, while a free update for all players in June added the ability to subclass, allowing for the mixing and matching of abilities from different classes in order to create entirely new playstyles.\n\nIt may not look like much, but Runescape, which is now in its 23rd year and comes in both its slightly-more-modern Runescape 3 form as well as Old School Runescape, is still one of the best MMORPG games of all time. It may be simple by modern standards, but there is a certain joy to be found in its point-and-click gameplay and its monotonous, yet satisfying, crafting skill grind.\n\nLike all great sandbox MMORPGs, Runescape largely leaves players to decide for themselves what interests to pursue, whether it's completing quests, mastering their crafting skills, or player-killing out in the Wilderness. It's one of the few great mobile MMORPG games available, complete with cross-play and cross-progression across platforms. Those who want to get the full Runescape experience will likely want to Jagex recently announced the first new skill in Old School Runescape history, sailing, will be added later in 2025.\n\nFor those who want a little more Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (with a large dose of anime) in their MMORPG, Tower of Fantasy is exactly what the doctor ordered. It shares plenty of DNA with the more-popular (but also largely single-player) Genshin Impact, but distinguishes itself with its shared open world, public events, co-op dungeons and a more sci-fi aesthetic. There's always something to explore, and it's easy to climb any mountain or glide to any distant spot that sparks interest. Similar to Genshin, its character-swapping action combat combined with each character's various elemental affinities keeps Tower of Fantasy's moment-to-moment gameplay interesting, especially as players earn new characters, form teams, and create new combos.\n\nThough players are more than capable of playing through its main story and many of its challenges with the game's various free characters, be warned that this is a gacha game, and many of its best characters will be inaccessible without spending large sums of money on the premium currency used to make luck-of-the-draw pulls.\n\nLike Destiny 2, Warframe isn't what many players would think of when it comes to a traditional MMORPG, but it has so many elements of the genre--shared spaces with large numbers of players, instanced dungeons and raids, high levels of customizability, crafting, guilds, etc.--that it's an MMO in all but name. Warframe has been around for over a decade, and in that time has continued to deliver best-in-class third-person-shooter gameplay alongside game-changing updates that have introduced spaceship combat, large-scale open worlds, and new story content to its sci-fi, cyber-ninja-filled universe.\n\nWith a \"Very Positive\" average user review score after over half a million reviews and counting on Steam, Warframe continues to impress, and features cross-play and cross-progression across PC, iOS, and consoles. It's also available on Nintendo Switch, making it one of the best Switch MMORPG games. A fantasy-themed successor, Soulframe, is slated to receive an open pre-alpha playtest this year.\n\nA top-down fantasy MMORPG that will look and feel familiar to Runescape fans, Albion Online takes its sandbox gameplay even further, with an almost entirely player-run economy, classless combat, and a focus on full-loot PvP with large-scale guild battles over territory. With PvP being such a large part of the endgame, and the high stakes of losing one's items when dying in PvP, Albion Online won't be for everyone.\n\nThere is PvE as well, with dungeons to explore and bosses to slay. For more farming or crafting-minded players, there is also the ability to build a home or even buy a private island and transform it into a farm, too. Few MMORPGs in the modern age truly commit to a sandbox approach like Albion Online, making it more than worth checking out, but those who have no interest in PvP or are easily frustrated by setbacks may want to look elsewhere.\n\nFor those who want to live out a superhero (or villain) fantasy instead of the sword-and-sorcery kind, there's DC Universe Online. Players can create their character, choose from a number of different powers, customize their costume, and then fight alongside iconic DC characters while exploring locations like Gotham City, Metropolis, and Arkham Asylum. DC Universe Online has been going steady for 14 years now and still receives multiple new episodic story updates for free each year. The latest episode, the Lantern Corp-focused Fearful Day, released in May\n\nAll of DCUO's new story content is free, though those with an optional subscription will be able to enjoy more rewards, character slots, and powers to choose from. DCUO isn't the only superhero MMORPG on the block, but its wide availability on both consoles and PC (and cross-play between PlayStation and PC players) does make it an easy choice for this list.\n\nThrone and Liberty's gameplay will instantly feel familiar to anyone who has played an MMORPG in the last two decades, with tab-targeting combat that heavily evokes WoW's gameplay. Where Throne and Liberty differs is in its impressive graphical fidelity, focus on open-world PvP, skills defined by weapon type instead of classes, and the use of players' animal-shapeshifting forms in order to sprint, glide, and swim around its world of Solisium instead of traditional mounts. Though much of its endgame focus is on large guild vs. guild castle sieges, there is still plenty of PvE content as well, including world events and dungeons.\n\nGiven its free-to-play nature, its endgame can become a bit grindy, but those looking for a satisfying MMORPG without a subscription could do much worse than Throne and Liberty. It's also one of the few MMORPGs on consoles, and, unlike other console MMOs like ESO, supports cross-play between platforms. Its first free expansion, Wilds of Talandre, releases in March 2025 and will introduce a new zone to explore, solo dungeons for players to conquer, and a revamp of its weapon mastery system.\n\nKnown for its massive spaceship battles with thousands of players, EVE Online is still one of the best MMORPGs available after two decades on the market. A true sandbox MMO where players are largely left to pursue their own interests--whether that's engaging in PvP battles or starting a trade empire--the entirety of its player base plays on a single server, and the actions its players take leave a lasting impact both on its in-game universe and its bustling player-driven economy.\n\nEven if its actual gameplay isn't quite as exciting as it might sound on paper (get used to looking at lots of menus and going AFK while your ship completes assigned actions), it's the stakes behind each action that give everything in EVE Online's world meaning. EVE Online can certainly be confusing for new players, but for those who stick with it and get involved with its various player-run communities, it's easy to see why the game is still being played 20 years later.\n\nThe original superhero MMO, 2004's City of Heroes, has found new life after having been taken offline by NCSoft in 2012. A fan server called City of Heroes: Homecoming received an official license to operate the game in 2024, and now City of Heroes is once again playable completely for free, with a volunteer team keeping the game running and updated thanks to player donations.\n\nCity of Heroes stands out thanks to its detailed character creator, where players get to choose not only their powers, but their origin story, costume, and even backstory. From there it's up to players to protect Paragon City as a hero or join the forces of villainy on The Rogues Isle, battling foes and joining Supergroups of other players along the way. Though City of Heroes is somewhat dated by today's standards, there is a reason many players have fond memories of their time with the MMO, as it offers a unique experience that can't be found in other games within the genre, even as games like DC Universe Online and Cryptic's spiritual successor, Champions Online, have since looked to follow in City of Heroes' footsteps.\n\nBlack Desert is a highly in-depth MMORPG that places a major emphasis on combat systems and customization. You might have heard that Black Desert has one of the steepest learning curves of any MMO, and that statement wouldn't be inaccurate. There are over a dozen classes to pick from in Black Desert, and each one offers a totally different way of approaching combat. You'll mostly engage in combat with real players and AI enemies, both of which require the utmost precision and lightning-fast reflexes to defeat. However, Black Desert also offers siege combat, allowing you to participate in large-scale wars in PvE or PvP.\n\nIf combat isn't your main interest, Black Desert features a massively open world with a slew of content to explore. You can complete quests, level up a slew of skills, and hunt for new gear. You'll also be able to customize your character in truly staggering ways, as the game has hundreds of clothing and appearance options.\n\nOnce Human isn't your traditional World of Warcraft-type MMORPG, but it's still a massive role-playing game nonetheless. The game starts by you joining a server and going through a tutorial for how its various mechanics work. Then, you'll be on your own in a huge map that features differently-scaled areas. Each area is available for you to venture into from the start, but the enemies in an area will all be at a specific level. To successfully navigate the areas, you need to level up your character by completing main story quests, which mainly involve the same gameplay loop, and jobs for various NPCs at the hub center of each area.\n\nCombat in Once Human involves guns as well as melee and long-range weapons, and all of the weapons in the game can be crafted at your base. Base-building plays a major role in Once Human, as it's how you unlock a majority of the game's usable content and helps to level up your character. When you venture outside your base, though, you'll have to keep your character healthy, as Once Human is also a survival game that has a hunger, thirst, and stamina bar, all of which need to be constantly maintained. It's a unique MMO experience that relies less on multiplayer elements, but other real players are still packed into a server with you.\n\nThe First Descendant is a game that falls somewhere in between a few different genres. However, by definition, it's a massively multiplayer online game that features role-playing elements. At its core, however, The First Descendant is a looter shooter that allows you to team up with other players to complete PvE objectives and defeat bosses. There is no PvP combat, but there's certainly enough content to keep you invested. The looting, which comes from defeating enemies and quests, is mostly RNG, so you'll often have to grind for hours to unlock a piece of content for your character or weapons. The gameplay is extremely enjoyable, though, so you'll often have no quarrel with grinding out gear.\n\nPalia is one of the very few MMORPGs that doesn't feature any sort of combat. Instead, you're placed in a world where you're tasked with building your dream home. Set in a fantasy world, Palia also falls into the life-simulator genre, allowing you to build and create anything your imagination can cook up. Of course, not everything is handed to you, as you'll have to venture out into the world to explore the various towns and other environments. Everywhere in Palia is teeming with life, and you'll even meet other players in the various hub areas, or you can visit them at the home they've built. Palia also offers plenty of lore that you learn as you explore, making it feel like you're a part of a real community.",

    "fullText": "The National Weather Service has issued a number of warnings as strong winds and heavy snow are expected to hit this weekend.\n\n\"A strong Bering Sea low pressure will bring strong winds, heavy snow, and blizzard conditions to Southwest Alaska beginning on Sunday morning. While conditions improve for most areas on Monday, hazardous winter weather will linger into Tuesday near Lake Iliamna and the Western Alaska Range,\" the NWS revealed.\n\nA high wind warning is in effect for parts of Alaska starting from Sunday morning through Monday as the state braces for winds up to 115 mph. A high wind warning is issued when an area is hit with sustained winds over 60 mph.\n\n\"Take Action! Sustained, strong winds with even stronger gusts are happening. Seek shelter. If you are driving, keep both hands on the wheels and slow down,\" the NWS said.\n\nWhile parts of the state brace for extremely dangerous winds, other parts of the state will start to receive heavy snowfall on Sunday afternoon. \"Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 12 and 24 inches, with localized amounts up to 30 inches from Port Alsworth to Iliamna. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph. Visibility reduced to one half mile or less at times,\" the NWS revealed.\n\n\"Snow will develop by Sunday afternoon and continue through Monday before tapering off to snow showers by Monday evening. Areas of stronger winds, especially around Lake Iliamna, may produce blowing snow that could significantly reduce visibility.\"\n\nIn the event of a strong wind event, the National Weather Service warned residents to stay inside.\n\n\"Immediately go inside a sturdy building during a high wind warning or severe thunderstorm warning and move to an interior room or basement,\" it said. \"If you are in a mobile home, move to a sturdy building before the winds pick up or the storm system reaches your location.\"",

    "fullText": "Over the last several days, the National Weather Service has done a great job detailing the various winter storm warnings that have deeply affected many people. While that is an extremely useful service that the agency provides, they do a lot more than report on snowfall and heavy winds.\n\nToday, the National Weather Service has reported on a major earthquake that has hit and revealed whether it is believed that it will create any tsunamis. Other reports have revealed that the earthquake struck a heavily populated area, which is always an important factor in determining how impactful an earthquake becomes. It is also notable that reports state that several landslides have been caused by the earthquake\n\nOn January 2, 2025, the National Weather Service issued a report detailing a 6.5 magnitude earthquake that had struck Southern Mexico. That report stated that the earthquake struck at 5:58 a.m. Pacific Standard Time at a depth of 6 miles underground near the coast of Guerrero, Mexico. The report also stated that the earthquake took place at the coordinates of 16.8 North and 99.3 West.\n\nA website published by Michigan Tech University details how serious a 6.5 magnitude earthquake can be. According to the website, an earthquake that falls within a 6.1 to 6.9 magnitude range, \"may cause a lot of damage in very populated areas.\"\n\nFortunately, the National Weather Service's report about the 6.5 magnitude earthquake states that there was no danger of a tsunami hitting the United States' West Coast, Alaska, or British Columbia. Furthermore, the report stated that based on past events that were similar, they didn't believe any Tsunamis would occur due to this earthquake. \"Based on earthquake information and historic tsunami records, the earthquake is not expected to generate a tsunami.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of Mexico's earthquake that struck on January 2nd, 2025, Newsweek published an article detailing its effects. That article stated that the earthquake had struck near Acapulco, a heavily populated tourist attraction. An ABC Eye Witness News 7 report published in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake detailed how residents of and tourists to the area were affected.\n\nMost importantly, the report detailed the fact that Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum had stated that no serious damage had been reported. Sheinbaum made that statement after speaking to Guerrero's Governor, Evelyn Salgado, who'd given her that news. However, the ABC report stated that Mexico's Civil Defense Agency had revealed that several landslides had been reported around Acapulco, including on highways in the state.\n\nOf course, details of the consequences of a 6.5 magnitude earthquake can change over time as more information can sometimes come to light. On top of that, it can take time for some damage to become obvious, and aftershocks can also change the dynamics.",

    "description": "An equipment outage and flooded roadways led to significant travel disruption at San Diego Airport, affecting over 300 flights.",
    "fullText": "Thousands of people flying into or out of San Diego on New Year's Day had their travel plans disrupted after a rainstorm hit the city.\n\nData from Flightradar24 showed 40 flights headed for San Diego International Airport decided to land elsewhere on January 1.\n\nThere were enough diversions that air traffic control activated a recovery tool to help planes reach their intended destinations.\n\nAnother 53 flights into or out of the airport were canceled, plus nearly 270 were delayed, according to data from FlightAware.\n\nThat meant around 40% of the flights were behind schedule.\n\nA spokesperson for the Federal Aviation Administration told Business Insider it slowed inbound flights \"due to poor visibility and weather conditions,\" and to perform maintenance on an instrument landing system's glide slope.\n\nA glide slope emits a radio signal that helps planes approach a runway from the correct angle and location, which is particularly useful in bad weather or at night.\n\nAn air traffic control advisory also said the disruption was due to an\"equipment outage.\"\n\nIn a post on X, the airport said the weather was causing flight delays, with some nearby roads closed due to flooding. The airport did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside local working hours.\n\nSan Diego is the third-busiest airport in California. It reported handling over 25 million passengers in 2024.\n\nWhile many of the diverted flights eventually made it to San Diego, it was likely a frustrating day for many travellers.\n\nJapan Airlines Flight 66 had flown about 10 hours from Tokyo to San Diego. After circling around the airport, it diverted to Los Angeles, a 30-minute flight away.\n\nJust over two hours later, the Boeing 787 took off again and completed the short flight down to San Diego.\n\nThe airline didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSome Southwest Airlines passengers departing Sacramento had a two-hour flight to nowhere. Flight 3138 spent an hour circling north of Los Angeles before returning to its origin, per flight-tracking data. It later took off again and reached San Diego about five hours behind schedule.\n\nWhile most flights were able to divert elsewhere in California, around a dozen of them diverted to Phoenix.\n\nA Southwest flight from Baltimore spent about an hour circling just west of the Arizona state capital before touching down there.\n\nIt was on the ground for over three hours before continuing on to San Diego, landing roughly five hours later than planned.\n\nA Southwest spokesperson said the airline canceled about 20 flights and diverted some others that later arrived in San Diego.\n\n\"Nothing is more important to Southwest than the safety of our customers and employees,\" they added.\n\nTwo private jets, flying from Colorado ski resorts, didn't have to divert too far — they were the only ones able to land at McClellan-Palomar Airport in northern San Diego County, per Flightradar24.",

    "fullText": "Iran ground to a near standstill Wednesday as businesses, universities and government offices closed under a government-ordered shutdown amid protests caused by a growing political and economic crisis.\n\nVideo footage circulating online and shared by the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MEK) shows intense clashes between protesters and security forces in cities, including Shiraz, Isfahan, Kermanshah and Tehran.\n\nIn the videos, protesters chant anti-regime slogans and confront security forces in crowded streets.\n\nFootage included scenes of screaming and apparent gunfire, with demonstrators throwing objects and shouting, \"Death to the Dictator\" and \"Proud Arakis, support, support.\"\n\nIran Reportedly Developing Chemical, Biological Missile Warheads As Protests Spread Over Collapsing Economy\n\nAdditional footage shared by MEK shows crowds chanting, \"Death to Khamenei!\" and \"Shame on you, shame on you!\" as anger appears to spread across the country, with a particular focus on bazaar-led protests in Tehran.\n\nSome of the most dramatic scenes were reported in the city of Fasa in south-central Iran. Video circulating online shows demonstrators hurling objects at the gates of a government complex and shaking them until they opened.\n\nOpposition groups also reported that protesters stormed the governor’s office, prompting Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces to open fire, per Reuters.\n\nIranian President Says His Country Is At 'Total War' With The Us, Israel And Europe: Reports\n\nMilitary helicopters were seen flying over the city, apparently to intimidate residents and prevent the unrest from spreading.\n\nIn Kermanshah, in western Iran, bazaar merchants were seen confronting security forces while chanting, \"Dishonorable, dishonorable,\" according to video footage.\n\nThe one-day shutdown affected 21 of Iran’s 31 provinces, including Tehran, as President Masoud Pezeshkian sought to contain mounting public anger fueled by inflation, currency instability and declining living standards.\n\nIran Killing Spree Continues As Regime Sets New Record For 2025 Executions, Dissident Group Says\n\nDemonstrations, strikes and clashes with security forces continued for a fourth consecutive day in cities across the country.\n\nThe unrest has unfolded alongside a series of high-level leadership changes that have added to uncertainty.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pezeshkian appointed Abdolnaser Hemmati, a former economy minister, as the new head of Iran’s central bank after the resignation of Mohammad Reza Farzin.\n\nState media quoted the president as acknowledging the role was \"extremely difficult and complex,\" warning that the new central bank chief would face intense pressure and criticism amid ongoing economic turmoil, according to Irna.\n\nSeparately, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei announced the appointment of IRGC Brig. Gen. Ahmad Vahidi as deputy commander in chief of the Revolutionary Guards.\n\nOriginal article",

    "description": "The Stannard Rock Lighthouse sits atop an underwater mountain in Lake Superior, marking a reef area that's dangerous for freighters and other boat traffic.",
    "fullText": "LAKE SUPERIOR, MI - A remote Michigan lighthouse sitting far offshore in Lake Superior has recorded one of today’s highest wind gusts amid a severe winter storm and blizzard conditions across the Upper Peninsula.\n\nWeather equipment on the Stannard Rock Lighthouse recorded a wind gust of 69 mph this morning. According to lists compiled by the National Weather Service, it’s the third-highest gust recorded so far during this storm. The highest gusts have been recorded as 72 mph in Sault Ste. Marie and 70 mph at Ford River near Escanaba.\n\nThe historic Stannard Rock Lighthouse sits off the eastern shore of Michigan’s Keweenaw Peninsula. Today, a Gale Warning has been issued for those Lake Superior waters until later tonight. Wind gusts as high as 57 mph are possible today, amid waves reaching 25 feet.\n\nBuilt 24 miles from the Upper Peninsula shoreline, Stannard Rock is considered the lighthouse farthest from shore in the contiguous United States. That has earned it the grim moniker as “The Loneliest Place in the World.”\n\nHistory of “The Loneliest Place in the World.”\n\nBuilt in 1883, the Stannard Rock station is well-known among Great Lakes lighthouse lore lovers. Its exposed crib - or base structure - is considered one of the Top 10 engineering feats in the U.S., according to the National Park Service. And it was built to mark a huge underwater reef that was considered one of the most dangerous obstacles to shipping in Lake Superior. The top of a large underwater mountain was found to sit just 4 feet from the surface of the water in some spots.\n\nHere’s a little more history to give you a feel for this place, courtesy of a social media post from the U.S. Coast Guard Station Marquette:\n\n“The old keepers told terrible tales of life on the Rock. Violent northwest storms sent 30-foot waves smashing into the tower and spray cascading over the lantern room 110 feet above the Lake. Louis Wilks from Marquette holds the record for consecutive time spent on the Rock – 99 days. No other keeper even approached this remarkable feat. The men were rotated off the Rock, three weeks on and one off. In 1939, the U.S. Coast Guard took over the lighthouse and overwhelming loneliness remained a problem.”\n\nThe lighthouse was automated in 1962, a year after a fatal fire and explosion that left survivors stranded at Stannard Rock for days until they were noticed by a passing ship. In 1971, the lighthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIt remains a working aid to navigation. While the lighthouse is closed to the public, it can be seen by boat or airplane.\n\nIf emergency repairs are needed in the winter, the U.S Coast Guard will use a helicopter to fly a team to the lighthouse.\n\nDetroit Forecast: Arctic cold and more snow ahead\n\n2 more rounds of lake effect snow before New Year’s Day\n\nNearly 100,000 remain without power across Michigan after one-two punch of ice, high winds",

    "fullText": "BUFFALO, N.Y. (WIVB) — Western New York’s latest winter storm has prompted Gov. Kathy Hochul to issue an advisory to caution commuters to stay off the roads and work from home if they can Monday.\n\nWith whiteout conditions expected at times along with wind gusts projected to reach upwards of 75 miles per hour — as well as the potential for flooding — Gov. Hochul is urging anyone who can to stay off the roads Monday evening, especially during the evening rush hour commute.\n\nWIVB News 4 was able to speak with Gov. Hochul on Sunday evening over the phone, where she also encouraged Western New Yorkers who can to work from home and avoid going out on the roadways.\n\n“Western New Yorkers, myself included, we think we’re tough, we can handle anything, but when you’re on the roads and there’s 50, 60, 70 mile-an-hour winds and the wind is blowing, it is a dangerous condition. And we want to encourage people if you can, stay off the roads, especially during tomorrow night’s commute from 4 to 7,” Gov. Hochul told News 4. “Just over the next couple of days if you can work remotely or stay home with the kids, forget returning that one item to the store that you don’t like for Christmas, you can do that later, just help us keep the roads clear. Stay home, stay safe.”\n\nAhead of the worst of the storm Monday, Gov. Hochul emphasized how her administration will continue to coordinate with local leaders to help keep Western New Yorkers safe from what’s expected to be, at times, a very severe winter weather event for parts of our area.\n\nA state of emergency that was declared by Gov. Hochul on Friday for more than half of New York’s counties remains in effect headed into Monday in anticipation of the worst of the storm.\n\nA flood watch has also been issued for parts of Western New York, as a slight risk of excessive rainfall is possible as a result of the storm. One to two inches of rain could cause flooding around rivers, creeks, streams and other low-lying areas.\n\nParts of Western New York could see between 1 and 2 feet of snow with this system, combined with high winds and cold temperatures. Snowfall rates of up to two inches an hour and strong winds will create significant blowing and drifting snow and near whiteout conditions in lake-effect areas.\n\nState and local leaders continue to coordinate ahead of the worst of the storm, taking steps to close certain highways where conditions could be very dangerous and life-threatening.\n\n“New Yorkers should monitor local forecasts and take caution to avoid travel in impacted areas,” Gov. Hochul said in a statement. “Plow crews, emergency management teams and utility personnel have been deployed and are ready to keep New Yorkers safe throughout the storm.”\n\nBeginning at 6 a.m. on Monday morning until further notice, an empty tractor trailer and tandem ban will be taking place on the following state highways in Western New York:\n\nI-90 (Thruway Authority Section from Exit 46 to the PA Line both east and westbound)\n\nI-990 (I-90 to State Route 263 Millersport Highway)\n\nRoute 400 (I-90 to State Route 16)\n\nRoute 219 (I-90 to State Route 39)\n\nThe City of Buffalo on Monday morning issued a travel advisory, effective immediately. The advisory was issued due to gusty winds combined with incoming snow creating “extreme whiteout conditions, reduced visibility, and hazardous travel conditions.”\n\n“City officials urge residents to avoid unnecessary travel, use caution if travel is required, and allow additional time to reach destinations,” the advisory said. “The City will continue to monitor weather conditions and provide updates as needed. Residents are encouraged to stay informed by signing up for BuffAlert, the City of Buffalo’s emergency notification system.”\n\nFor real-time travel information, motorists should call 511 or visit www.511NY.org, New York State’s official traffic and travel information source.\n\nRob Petree is an anchor and reporter who joined the News 4 team in 2025.

    "title": "'Onyx Storm' left readers with lots of unanswered questions. Here's everything Rebecca Yarros has said about the 4th 'Empyrean' book so far.",
    "description": "Rebecca Yarros released \"Onyx Storm\" in January 2025, but readers are already looking forward to the next book in the \"Fourth Wing\" universe.",
    "fullText": "It's been nearly a year since Rebecca Yarros released \"Onyx Storm,\" and fans are growing increasingly desperate for dragon rider Violet Sorrengail's story to continue.\n\n\"Onyx Storm\" was the third book in Yarros' \"Empyrean\" series, following \"Fourth Wing\" and \"Iron Flame.\" It centers on Violet's journey to become a dragon rider and fight forces of dark magic at Basgiath War College. The series is set to have five novels when it is complete, all of which will be published by Entangled's fantasy imprint, Red Tower.\n\n\"Onyx Storm\" — the fastest-selling adult novel released in 20 years, according to The New York Times — ended on a cliffhanger, so Yarros' readers have been clamoring to get their hands on the next romantasy novel in the series since the moment they finished book three.\n\nYarros has yet to start writing the next \"Empyrean\" novel, but she has offered clues about book four.\n\nThe rest of this article has spoilers for the \"Empyrean\" series.\n\nYarros released the first three books in the \"Empyrean\" series in under two years. \"Fourth Wing\" came out in April 2023, \"Iron Flame\" was released in October 2023, and \"Onyx Storm\" hit shelves in January 2025.\n\nFans shouldn't expect Yarros to write the next series installment at the same pace. Speaking at an engagement in Philadelphia on January 25, 2025, Yarros said she wouldn't commit to a release date for the fourth \"Empyrean\" novel, as she was writing a contemporary novel first.\n\nShe also said she planned to take time off to be with her family before she writes the fourth book.\n\nYarros also told Elle that she intended to rest before returning to writing because the amount of work she did in recent years wasn't good for her mentally or physically, as she has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and POTS.\n\nYarros stayed true to her word, sharing photos of herself on vacation with her family on Instagram in the months after \"Onyx Storm\" was released. Then, in June 2025, she shared that she had started writing her next contemporary novel. She also shared a photo of the office in her new home, which has a large portrait of a scene from \"Fourth Wing\" and a fireplace with dragon sculptures built into it.\n\nOn December 8, 2025, Yarros provided another update on the status of the fourth \"Empyrean\" novel in an Instagram post, saying that the novel was next in her queue after she finishes the contemporary book she is writing.\n\n\"For transparency's sake… I'm currently working on a contracted contemporary, and once I'm done, I'll be living in the Empyrean world,\" she wrote in the caption of her post. \"I can't wait for you guys to see what I have in store for you!\"\n\nMany fans are finding it particularly difficult to wait for the next \"Empyrean\" novel because of the ending of \"Onyx Storm.\"\n\nAt the end of the book, Xaden used more of his venin power, giving into the dark side of his transition; another unnamed dragon rider turned venin; Andarna returned to Violet after her time away with the irids; and Violet woke up with a wedding ring and blessing of her marriage to Xaden from the goddess Dunne with no memory of the last 12 hours of her life. In the book's final line, her fellow rider Imogen reveals she used her signet power to wipe Violet's memory of the night — at her request.\n\nViolet's brother, Brennan, also revealed that six dragon eggs and four riders, including Xaden and his best friend, Garrick Tavis, are missing.\n\nHopefully, the fourth book in the \"Empyrean\" series will reveal what happened between Violet and Xaden, where Xaden and the other missing riders are, the location of the missing eggs, what Andarna learned from her time with the irids, and how Xaden's additional use of his venin powers harmed his soul.\n\nLikewise, Violet will likely still be searching for a cure to turning venin to bring Xaden back, but as his wife, she also becomes the Duchess of Tyrrendor. She will have new power and responsibility in his absence, and readers will have to wait to see how she balances her new role while developing her signets.\n\nYarros went on an \"Onyx Storm\" book tour after the book was released in January 2025, offering some insight into the future of the series as she connected with fans.\n\nFor instance, at an event in Los Angeles on January 21, 2025, Yarros said, \"Someone you love won't make it in book four.\" That comment isn't that surprising, as beloved characters have died in each installment of the series. However, Yarros got more specific with her hints as her book tour continued.\n\nAt an event in St. Louis on January 31, 2025, Yarros shared that readers have more to discover about the isles Violet explores in \"Onyx Storm.\" When host Lexi Ryan asked her why there was no map of the isles included in \"Onyx Storm,\" Yarros said it \"was deemed to be too spoilery\" by her editorial team, suggesting Violet doesn't know all she will about the isles by the end of book three.\n\nThen, speaking at an event in Denver on February 2, 2025, Yarros shared clues about who Xaden's new venin brother could be.\n\n\"I would pay attention to who's missing at the end,\" she said. \"I would pay attention to someone who feels like whatever they have given is not enough, which is always the case when you turn venin.\"\n\nFans think Xaden's cousin Bodhi Durran, Garrick, or even Violet's brother Brennan could fit that description at the end of \"Onyx Storm.\"\n\nYarros also discussed a plot device she uses that may have consequences for the series. After riders bond a dragon at threshing at Basgiath, the rider announces the dragon's name to the Scribes so it can be recorded. However, Yarros pointed out to fans that the dragons never speak their name to the Scribes directly. It's possible some riders don't share their real names or that dragons lie to their riders, which could help the children of rebels bond dragons their relatives previously bonded, giving them second signet powers. The potential for faux dragon identities could also have other ramifications for the series.\n\nSpeaking more on signet powers in Denver, Yarros said readers had only seen \"like 10%\" of Violet's dream-walking abilities, in part because others who developed the power would have been killed, making it difficult for Violet to learn how to use the signet.\n\n\"There's probably one person alive that can train her,\" Yarros said, though she gave no information about who that person is.\n\nShe also said Xaden's inntinnsic signet has only reached \"like 50%\" of its potential, so his abilities will likely grow in book four.\n\nIn addition, Yarros revealed at the Los Angeles Festival of Books in April 2025 that she has a title picked out for the fourth book, though she didn't say what it was.\n\nOn October 24, 2025, Yarros appeared at Romantasy Bookcon in Orlando, hosted by Fabled Fantasy Events. She spoke with the hosts of the \"Fantasy Fangirls\" podcast, Lexi Ayala and Nicole Holleman, about the \"Empyrean\" series, and Yarros offered hints and sneak peeks at book four.\n\nFor instance, Yarros discussed how the dramatic ending of \"Onyx Storm\" will impact the next book, telling Ayala and Holleman that readers will know what happened to Violet during her 12 missing hours by the novel's end.\n\nLikewise, when the duo asked Yarros about a scene she was excited to write in the next \"Empyrean\" novel, she said, \"I'm really excited to write the moment Violet realizes why Xaden married her. That I am pumped for.\"\n\nOf course, Xaden loves Violet, but considering he had turned venin and the marriage would give Violet political power as the Duchess of Tyrrendor, there is likely more to their union than meets the eye.\n\nYarros also warned that readers \"should really be prepared in book four to see Xaden enter his villain era,\" indicating his marriage to Violet won't stop him from going full venin in the next \"Empyrean\" novel.\n\nThe \"Fantasy Fangirls\" also asked Yarros if Imogen had been wiping Violet's memories at other times in the \"Empyrean\" series, which many readers had been wondering after the ending of \"Onyx Storm.\" Rather than giving a direct answer, Yarros said, \"I think it depends on what you believe of Imogen's character. What has Imogen shown you of her character? What has she told Violet about her signet?\"\n\nIn the \"Empyrean\" series, readers only see Imogen wipe memories when Violet or Xaden specifically ask her to do so. However, much of the series is only told from Violet's limited perspective, so there may have been occasions when Imogen wiped people's memories without Violet's knowledge.\n\nLikewise, Yarros addressed some of her readers' concerns surrounding Bodhi, as there is a contingent of \"Empyrean\" fans who think Xaden's cousin has feelings for Violet, saying, \"Bodhi has a thing for what Xaden has. But he doesn't want to.\"\n\nHer response indicates that Bodhi may be jealous of Xaden rather than in love with Violet. And considering he is one of the potential candidates to have turned venin at the end of \"Onyx Storm,\" Yarros' response is particularly eyebrow-raising.\n\nYarros also gave some hints about the structure of the next book, telling Ayala and Holleman that she plans to offer multiple points of view in the narration of book four. She even specified that some portion of the book will be told from Sloane Mairi's perspective.\n\nFinally, Yarros told readers to pay attention to the black dragons in the \"Empyrean\" series, encouraging them to ask themselves why there are so few black dragons in the world, adding that it's \"very relevant\" that two new baby black dragons hatched in \"Iron Flame.\"\n\nIt will still be a while until the next \"Empyrean\" book is published, but hopefully Yarros' clues can tide readers over while they wait. In the meantime, they can read other romantasy novels to make the wait a bit more bearable.",

    "fullText": "Staying warm and off the road is better than Ezra\n\nAs Winter Storm Ezra intensifies across the central and eastern United States, the freight industry faces a severe threat from high winds that could blow over trailers, disrupting operations and endangering drivers. The storm, which began escalating on Sunday, is unleashing gusts of 50+ mph in parts of the Upper Midwest, with impacts stretching east of Interstate 35, according to real-time data from SONAR Critical Events. SONAR is actively monitoring the situation, providing critical insights to assess and mitigate the storm’s impact on the freight market as conditions worsen.\n\nHigh winds are a massive hazard for truckers, as their trailers become kites in 40+mph winds. \n\nThis can happen on the highway, right next to you as you drive with your family. You can become a victim of a trailer being blown over. \n\nExercise extra caution this week in highways… https://t.co/fWAw5ufbZo\n\n(@FreightAlley) December 29, 2025\n\nHigh Winds Turn Trailers into Hazards, Urging Drivers to Stay Home\n\nSONAR Critical Events has issued high wind alerts for regions east of I-35, with gusts of 50+ mph reported in the Upper Midwest. The platform is tracking an extratropical cyclone set to impact the U.S. and Canada from 2:00 AM EST on December 29 through 3:00 AM EST on December 30, offering freight operators data to navigate potential market disruptions. Winds exceeding 40 mph pose a critical risk, turning truck trailers into kite-like structures vulnerable to rollovers—especially on highways with dense traffic in the Midwest.\n\nThis hazard threatens not only freight movement but also the safety of drivers and other road users. SONAR’s data highlights “High Road Danger” conditions across states like Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, and the Northeast, as well as Canadian provinces like Ontario and Quebec, where road obstructions, collisions, and closures are already emerging. Truck drivers are strongly urged to stay home if possible to avoid these life-threatening risks as the storm peaks Monday.\n\nSONAR Critical Events: Monitoring Wind Impacts on Freight Stability\n\nSONAR’s real-time monitoring provides a detailed wind forecast to help the freight industry prepare. The latest update includes:\n\nWind Gusts: Ranging from 30 to 45 mph, with maxima reaching 50 mph, particularly in the Upper Midwest, where Michigan’s Upper Peninsula has already seen gusts exceeding 65 km/h (40 mph).\n\nImpact Areas: States east of I-35, including the Great Lakes region and Northeast, are under close watch as SONAR evaluates potential delays and cost increases.\n\nMarket Implications: The combination of strong winds and blowing snow reduces visibility and increases the likelihood of trailer rollovers, potentially driving up insurance costs and shipment delays.\n\nSONAR’s advanced mapping tools enable logistics managers to identify high-risk lanes where staying off the road is the safest option. The platform’s recommendation to avoid driving aligns with efforts to protect drivers and stabilize freight operations during the storm’s height.\n\nIndustry Response and Preparedness\n\nWinter Storm Ezra’s rapid intensification has SONAR on high alert, with enhanced collaboration with WeatherOptics delivering hyperlocal wind insights to help carriers adjust schedules and mitigate market instability. SONAR is also tracking lake-effect snow driven by these winds, with potential accumulations up to 60 cm (24 inches) along Lake Superior’s south shore, which could further disrupt cross-border freight from Canada. The focus remains on keeping trailers upright, with drivers encouraged to stay home if their routes fall within these danger zones.\n\nLooking Ahead: SONAR’s Ongoing Analysis Through Tuesday\n\nAs the Arctic air mass fueling Ezra interacts with warmer southern air, SONAR predicts the storm’s wind-driven impacts, including trailer rollover risks, will persist through Tuesday. The platform is continuously analyzing high road danger conditions and potential shipment delays affecting tens of millions across the Plains to the Northeast.\n\nLogistics managers should leverage SONAR Critical Events for updates, preparing for extended transit times on east-west routes where crosswinds are most severe. The clear message to truck drivers: stay home if possible to avoid the devastating impact of a trailer blown over by gusts. This real-time intelligence is crucial for optimizing freight market resilience.\n\nFreightWaves will continue to track Winter Storm Ezra’s progression, relying on SONAR’s monitoring to keep the industry informed. With winds threatening to topple trailers across the eastern U.S., safety and strategic planning are paramount. Stay tuned for further developments as the storm unfolds.\n\nThe post Truckers east of I-35 advised to stay home appeared first on FreightWaves.",

    "fullText": "The United States has already been hit with quite a few winter storms over the past several weeks, bringing heavy snow and high winds to parts of the country. Now, another major winter storm is approaching parts of the United States, and the National Weather Service (NWS) has warned about the dangers it could bring.\n\nOn Sunday, the NWS issued a winter storm warning for parts of the country and even a blizzard warning for parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin as Winter Storm Ezra approached, bringing as much as 25 inches of snow and 75 mile per hour winds to some parts of the country.\n\nAs a result of what has been described as a \"dangerous\" and \"potentially life-threatening\" storm, the NWS is urging people in the area to simply stay inside and do not travel.\n\nOn Sunday, the NWS warned of a powerful winter storm that was expected to impact at least 15 states around the country, bringing \"heavy snow, blizzard conditions, hazardous ice, and bitterly cold wind chills\" to some parts of the country.\n\n\"A rapidly-intensifying storm will move from the Great Lakes into southern Canada today through Monday. Heavy snow, blizzard conditions, and icing are expected from the Upper Midwest through the Great Lakes and Northeast,\" the NWS warned in an advisory early Sunday morning.\n\nThe NWS warned of \"blizzard conditions\" that would result in \"dangerous travel conditions.\"\n\nA rapidly intensifying low pressure system will bring a plethora of impactful winter weather hazards through early next week over the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes, & Northeast. Heavy snow, blizzard conditions, treacherous icing, high winds, & bitterly cold wind chills are expected. pic.twitter.com/TRZ3YLu3uJ\n\n— NWS Weather Prediction Center (@NWSWPC) December 28, 2025\n\n\"Over a foot of lake-enhanced snow along Michigan's Sioux Falls Upper Peninsula is forecast. Blizzard conditions are likely, resulting in dangerous travel conditions and scattered power outages across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes Omaha into Monday. Heavy lake-effect snow is expected on westerly flow from Lakes Erie and Ontario Monday afternoon into Tuesday,\" the NWS warned.\n\nWhile the NWS map shows areas of the country receiving 18 inches of snow, some meteorologists are predicting up to 36 inches of snow in some areas.\n\nIn addition to the massive snow accumulation, the NWS warned of strong winds and dangerously cold temperatures, as well.\n\n\"Wind gusts in excess of 40 mph and bitterly cold temperatures spilling south from Canada will lead sub-zero wind chills into Monday. Dangerously cold wind chills as cold as -30°F are likely in North Dakota and northern Minnesota,\" the NWS warned.\n\nAs a result of these extreme conditions that have persisted throughout the season, the NWS has continually urged anyone in the area to stay indoors as much as possible, especially amid the sub-zero wind chills and strong winds.\n\n“Cold outside? Avoid the risk of frostbite and hypothermia by dressing in layers, covering exposed skin, and limiting time outdoors,” the NWS wrote in a post on X earlier this month. “If someone might be experiencing either condition, seek medical attention immediately — and know your actions.”\n\nThis type of severe winter weather is especially dangerous for newborns, the elderly, those with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, and unhoused individuals, the NWS warned.\n\n“Everyone is at risk from the dangers of extreme cold, but these groups are more vulnerable than most. Age and certain conditions make the body less able to regulate temperature,” the NWS warns.\n\nThe NWS advised people to limit time outside, but to wear loose layers and cover all skin if they do have to venture outdoors. Additionally, the NWS advises people to consume hot foods and warm drinks, but avoid caffeine and alcohol.\n\nIn addition to urging everyone to stay indoors and out of the elements as much as possible, the NWS has also warned against even attempting to try to travel in these extreme conditions.\n\nThe NWS has issued a blizzard warning for parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin, warning of \"dangerous\" and \"potentially life-threatening\" travel conditions. In those areas, the NWS warned to avoid travel altogether.\n\nOther areas are in a winter storm warning rather than a more severe blizzard warning. In those areas, the NWS still urges people to reconsider and limit their travels and to expect \"considerable travel problems.\"\n\nIf travel is absolutely necessary, the NWS urges travelers to be prepared with some emergency items like a cell phone charger, a flashlight, a first aid kit, jumper cables, road flares, tire chains or snow tires, water and snacks, a full tank of gas, a bag of sand or cat litter, a shovel, an ice scraper, a tow rope, water and snacks, and warm clothing and blankets.\n\n\"You never know when you will encounter winter weather or an emergency road closure,\" the NWS warns.",

    "fullText": "More than 60 million people across the U.S. are under winter weather alerts as a powerful storm system targets the Northeast after Christmas, while a separate atmospheric river continues to batter California with flooding rain, high winds and dangerous conditions.\n\nForecasters warn the systems could disrupt flights and road travel as millions of Americans head home after the holidays.\n\nThe severe weather is expected to unfold over several days, with impacts stretching from the West Coast to the Northeast. Forecasters say conditions on the ground could change quickly, affecting everything from short drives to long-distance travel. Here’s what to know about the most affected regions.\n\nThe tristate area is expected to bear the brunt of a major winter storm on Friday, with snow, sleet and freezing rain forecast to create hazardous travel conditions. Accumulating snow is forecast to hit New York, Connecticut and New Jersey — where a state of emergency has been declared — beginning Friday through early Saturday. Some forecast models suggest that parts of New York and New Jersey will see up to 9 inches of snow, depending on the storm’s track.\n\nThe storm is already disrupting air travel in the region. As of Friday morning, at least 1,300 flights across the U.S. had been canceled, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware, with delays expected to grow as the storm intensifies.\n\nSnowfall totals of roughly 1 to 6 inches are expected across northeastern Pennsylvania, much of New Jersey, large portions of New York state and parts of southern and central New England, with higher amounts possible in elevated areas north and west of New York City.\n\nThe system is also expected to bring sleet and freezing rain to parts of Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia and northern Virginia. A wintry mix is likely in cities including Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C.\n\nOn the West Coast, California is facing dangerous conditions from a powerful atmospheric river system bringing flooding rain, high winds and heavy mountain snow to the state.\n\nWith atmospheric rivers, intense rainfall, and strong winds ahead, I’m declaring a state of emergency in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Shasta counties to activate emergency authorities and preposition resources to keep our communities safe. pic.twitter.com/C3eLImPkwx\n\n— Governor Gavin Newsom (@CAgovernor) December 24, 2025\n\nThe storm has already turned deadly, with at least three deaths reported in Southern California.\n\nParts of Southern California saw record-breaking rainfall earlier this week, with some locations seeing their wettest Christmas Eve or Christmas-week totals in decades.\n\nThe prolonged rainfall has increased the threat of mudslides, particularly in areas recently burned by wildfires. Officials have urged residents to avoid flooded roadways and to be prepared to evacuate if conditions worsen.\n\nAt higher elevations, the same storm system has delivered dangerous winter weather to the Sierra Nevada, making mountain travel hazardous across parts of California and western Nevada.\n\nAvalanche warnings were issued for parts of the Sierra as heavy snow and strong winds created unstable conditions in the mountains. Forecasters say 5 to 10 feet of snow could pile up in some high-elevation areas, significantly increasing avalanche risk and making travel especially dangerous through the weekend.\n\nThe Sierra Avalanche Center has issued a Backcountry Avalanche Watch for the backcountry areas around the Greater Lake Tahoe region as high avalanche danger is expected Thursday.

    "title": "Airlines are canceling flights ahead of a winter storm. Here's what to do if your flight is delayed or canceled.",
    "description": "As a snow storm heads toward the New York City area, airlines are delaying and canceling thousands of flights.",
    "fullText": "A winter storm expected to hit the Northeast is causing thousands of flight delays and cancellations.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued a winter storm warning for areas around New York City, extending into Connecticut and New Jersey. The service expects heavy snow accumulations between six and nine inches.\n\nAbout 1,400 flights in the US have been canceled, as of 2:20 p.m. ET, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware. Over 5,100 US flights have been delayed, per the service.\n\nAffected travel hubs, including New York's John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia, and Newark Liberty airports, have begun issuing weather warnings.\n\nSome airlines have begun offering solutions to travelers affected by the storm. JetBlue, Delta, and Southwest have all waived fare differences for those changing flights from airports around the New York metropolitan area.\n\nThe delays and cancellations come during a high-density travel period around the winter holiday. AAA projected that 8.03 million Americans would fly domestically between December 20 and January 1.\n\nHere is the best advice for what to do if your flight is disrupted.\n\nAccording to the Department of Transportation, there is no law requiring US airlines to compensate passengers for disruptions caused by uncontrollable events, such as weather. That also includes air traffic control delays.\n\nThe only rule carriers must follow is to refund customers in the event of cancellations, even for non-controllable events. And that does not mean travel credits or vouchers — it must be cash, and includes any add-ons, such as bags or seats.\n\nBut carriers do not owe meals, hotel rooms, or financial compensation for storm-related cancellations or delays — because the cause is the weather, not the airline.\n\nPassengers are still entitled to a refund or rebooking on the same airline, but carriers are not required to provide additional accommodations or rebook on another airline.\n\nIf you choose to travel but your flight is delayed or canceled, ask the airline for the reason — ideally in writing — so you know what you're entitled to. Airlines have different policies for disruptions they control, like crew or maintenance issues.\n\nThe DoT's Airline Customer Service Dashboard — launched in 2022 — shows what the 10 largest US airlines promise in those cases, including rebookings, meal vouchers, and hotel accommodations.\n\nWhen a flight delay or cancellation is announced, expect people to flock to the nearest customer service line for assistance, and for the phone lines to clog.\n\nWait times can be painfully long, and the best alternatives will likely go quickly. However, some airlines offer the option to rebook on their website or mobile app and waive any fees, making it sometimes easier to make changes online than in person.\n\nIf all available options are exhausted, have a plan B, such as waiting to speak with a live agent, contacting the airline through social media, or booking a hotel for the night.\n\nDirect messaging on Facebook or Twitter can actually serve as a virtual placeholder, and you may hear back via chat before speaking to a live agent.\n\nHere are the phone numbers for each airline:\n\nFor controllable delays or cancellations that result in a customer waiting at least three hours for a new flight or requiring an overnight stay, several airlines will offer meal or hotel vouchers.\n\nCarriers offering both are Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, and United Airlines, per the DoT dashboard.\n\nFrontier Airlines is the only carrier that does not offer accommodations in the event of an overnight delay or cancellation, but it will provide a meal voucher.\n\nFor US airlines not listed on the dashboard, or in cases where the disruption is uncontrollable (like because of a winter storm), or if the compensation is unclear, simply ask.\n\nIt never hurts to request a meal or hotel during flight disruptions, and you might get lucky with a goodwill gesture from the carrier.\n\nSeveral major banks offer credit cards that come with travel insurance, like Chase's Sapphire Reserve or American Express' Platinum Card. Both offer trip protection, meaning customers who purchased their flight with that specific card can reap the benefits.\n\nFor example, in the case of a major storm system, it's likely many passengers will end up stranded in random cities across the US.\n\nHowever, banks with travel insurance included can reimburse cardholders for unexpected expenses outside their control, including hotel, meal, and transportation costs.\n\nTravel insurance does not apply in all circumstances, like short delays, so be sure to check your policy before making a claim — but it also doesn't hurt to make the claim anyway, even if the answer is no.\n\nDuring the holidays, it's easy to lose sight of your purpose — seeing friends and family or simply getting away from home for a few days.\n\nHowever, delays and cancellations are inevitable. Don't spend all day sitting around waiting — give yourself a cut-off time. Once that moment passes, consider alternative means of getting to your destination, such as driving or taking a bus or train (which may also be covered by travel insurance).\n\nIf you are stuck in another city and have no other option but to stay in a hotel or wait at the airport, decide how you want to spend your time and make a plan.\n\nEditor's note: This article was originally published in 2023 and has been updated.",

    "fullText": "WRIGHTWOOD, Calif. (AP) — A strong storm system that brought relentless winds, rain and snowfall to California this week was expected to ease Friday, but there was still a risk of high surf along the coast, flash flooding near Los Angeles and avalanches in the Sierra Nevada.\n\nWaves near the San Francisco Bay Area could reach up to 25 feet (7.6 meters) Friday, parts of Southern California were at risk of flooding, and avalanches could hit the Lake Tahoe area, officials warned. Residents were told to be ready to evacuate the mountain town of Wrightwood about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northeast of Los Angeles because of mudslides.\n\nAtmospheric rivers carried massive plumes of moisture from the tropics during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year. The storms were blamed for at least two deaths earlier in the week.\n\nThe system brought the wettest Christmas season to downtown Los Angeles in 54 years, the National Weather Service said.\n\nRoads in the 5,000-resident town of Wrightwood were covered in rocks, debris and thick mud on Thursday. With power out, a gas station and coffee shop running on generators were serving as hubs for residents and visitors.\n\n“It’s really a crazy Christmas,” said Jill Jenkins, who was spending the holiday with her 13-year-old grandson, Hunter Lopiccolo.\n\nLopiccolo said the family almost evacuated the previous day, when water washed away a chunk of their backyard. But they decided to stay and still celebrated the holiday. Lopiccolo got a new snowboard and e-bike.\n\n“We just played card games all night with candles and flashlights,” he said.\n\nDavey Schneider hiked a mile and a half (1.6 kilometers) through rain and floodwater up to his shins from his Wrightwood residence Wednesday to rescue cats from his grandfather’s house.\n\n“I wanted to help them out because I wasn’t confident that they were going to live,” Schneider said Thursday. “Fortunately, they all lived. They’re all okay — just a little bit scared.”\n\nArlene Corte said roads in town turned into rivers, but her house was not damaged.\n\n“It could be a whole lot worse,” she said. “We’re here talking.”\n\nWith more rain on the way, more than 150 firefighters were stationed in the area, said San Bernardino County Fire spokesman Shawn Millerick.\n\n“We’re ready,” he said. “It’s all hands on deck at this point.”\n\nA falling tree killed a San Diego man Wednesday, news outlets reported. Farther north, a Sacramento sheriff’s deputy died in what appeared to be a weather-related crash.\n\nAreas along the coast, including Malibu, were under a flood watch until Friday afternoon, and wind and flood advisories were issued for much of the Sacramento Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nSouthern California typically gets half an inch to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 centimeters) of rain this time of year, but this week many areas could see between 4 and 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters), with even \n\nMore wind and heavy snow was expected in the Sierra Nevada, where gusts created “near white-out conditions” and made mountain pass travel treacherous.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom declared emergencies in six counties to allow state assistance.\n\nThe state deployed resources and first responders to several coastal and Southern California counties, and the California National Guard was on standby.",

In Philadelphia, you can expect a mix of sleet and freezing rain with some snow. South Jersey and Delaware will transition to rain at some point overnight Friday.\n\nThe Philly area will start seeing precipitation around 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. on Friday, again moving west to east. Then, models predict the storm will move offshore sometime between 10 a.m. and noon on Saturday.\n\nModels vary about potential snow totals. But in general, forecasters predict between one and two inches of snow in northern Delaware, 1.5–4 inches in the Philadelphia area, and higher snow totals the further north you travel.\n\nPhiladelphia, according to the National Weather Service, has a nearly 30% chance of seeing 4 inches of snow/sleet or more by Satuday morning, with those chances being as high as 63% just 30 miles north in Trenton.\n\nIn addition to snow, experts predict large ice accumulation overnight Friday into Saturday, making streets and sidewalks dangerously slippery.\n\nThe National Weather Service says that people \"should consider delaying all travel\" until after the winter storm is over.\n\n\"If travel is absolutely necessary, drive with extreme caution,\" the NWS said, recommending travelers bring safety kits and other supplies in the event that they get stranded.\n\nInformation in this story is from FOX 29 meteorologist Sue Serio and the National Weather Service.",

Some areas had already received 4 to 8 inches of rain by Wednesday morning, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nAnother wave of the storm was expected to hit on Christmas Day, with flood and wind advisories for \"life-threatening\" storm conditions from the National Weather Service remaining in effect until Thursday afternoon.\n\nOver 163,000 homes and businesses across California were still without power on Christmas morning, according to poweroutage.us.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Redding Police Department reported one storm-related fatality in Northern California.

Winds up to 100 mph are likely along the top ridges until Friday morning.\n\n“The strong winds and weight of snow on tree limbs may down power lines and could cause sporadic power outages,” the NWS warned in its advisory. “Whiteout conditions are expected and will make travel treacherous and potentially life-threatening. Travel could be very difficult to impossible.”\n\nParts of Idaho are expected to see some heavy winter weather this week, especially those at higher elevations. The NWS warns of several feet of snow and wind gusts of up to 35 miles per hour in some areas of the state through Thursday.\n\n\"Heavy snow expected,\" the NWS wrote in its advisory. \"Total snow accumulations of around 5 inches to 1 foot at elevations 6500 feet to 8000 feet. Above 8000 feet expect 1 to 2 feet of snow. For highest peaks, up to 3 feet of snow is likely. For Galena Summit about 1 foot of snow is expected. Accumulations in Ketchum and Sun Valley will be much lower at 2 inches or less. Winds gusting as high as 35 MPH.\"\n\nObviously, this could make travel difficult during the holiday season.\n\n\"Travel could be very difficult to impossible, mainlyover Galena Summit and in backcountry areas. Expect blowing and drifting snow,\" the NWS warned.",

It is also a great time to meet up and reconnect with those faces you may not have seen in a while, or just time to unwind and relax. Either way, games are a great way to spend newfound time off, and luckily, 2025 saw the release of some wonderful titles that can appeal to whatever sort of gaming relaxation you are looking for.\n\nWhether you're looking for a game to boot up at a party or something to put on and escape into as a blizzard rages outside, here are 10 games that are great to check out this holiday.\n\nNothing screams holidays quite like getting together again with your friends or family and screaming at them for stealing your stars in a Mario Party game. The release of the Nintendo Switch 2 saw the updated rerelease of Super Mario Party Jamboree along with it. This new title in the beloved digital board game series is packed with over 110 minigames and a roster of 22 characters, so there are more options for people to settle for after the no.1 character, Yoshi, is picked.\n\nRead our review of Super Mario Party Jamboree here\n\nWhen work is slowing down for the holidays, friends are home from school, and it's time to relax and let off some steam, Call of Duty Black Ops 7 is here for you. Whether you want to squad up with that same group you've been playing with since the old days or mowing down some zombies with your cousins or siblings, few games can offer quite the same cathartic gunplay as a new CoD game. And if you instead want to just check out a wild story, then hop into campaign mode, where you can play as Milo Ventimiglia, the actor behind Peter Petrelli from the mid-2000s superhero drama on NBC, Heroes.\n\nRead our review of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 here\n\nWith the cold weather settling in and snow coming down, sometimes it can be nice to settle in for a nice, long comfort RPG, and the new Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D Remake is perfect for those cold nights indoors. Following up on last year's Dragon Quest III Remake, DQ I&II are impressive and expansive retellings of the original games that came out nearly 40 years ago. With classic turn-based combat and a run time that can easily last 70+ hours, Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D pairs perfectly with a soft blanket and a mug of hot chocolate.\n\nRead our review of DQ I&II HD-2D Remake here\n\nFew games this year have garnered quite as much discussion and fervor as Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. If, for some reason, you haven't had a chance yet to play it, this holiday if you have some time off work or school, do yourself a favor and play this game. From its complex world, captivating characters, and an enthralling soundtrack, if you have friends or family who also play games, play this game; it will give you all plenty of things to talk about.\n\nRead our review of Expedition 33 here.\n\nI've never quite understood the idea of Sonic the Hedgehog driving a car when he could run faster than one, but when a game is as fun as Sonic Racing: Crossworld is, those thoughts flow out of my head. Crossworlds is the best classic cart racer this year with exciting tracks, neat vehicle transformations, and a ton of characters -now from worlds and properties outside of Sonic! Gather around your screen for some local split-screen shananigans or play online with 12 players at once for a truly chaotix time.\n\nRead our review of Sonic Racing: Crossworlds here\n\nIf you are looking for more of a cooperative jaunt, one of the best this year is Split Fiction, from Hazelight Studios, the same team behind the also fantastic It Takes Two. Split Fiction is a split-screen adventure where you and another person will work together through a variety of tricky challenges covering all sorts of game genres all under the umbrella of a wonderful tale of friendship. As an added bonus, only one person needs to own a copy of the game as you can invite another player to play with you online using the free Friend's Pass.\n\nRead our review of Split Fiction here.\n\nThere is something to be said about a game where you can play on the couch, losing hours to it, and Ball X Pit is a game that fits that bill. This clever twist on the classic brick-breaking formula is a rougelike indie game where you unlock new adventurers and descend into a pit to defeat menacing monsters by bouncing a wide variety of special spherical projectiles at them. In addition to being able to upgrade and fuse these powerful weapons, you will also unlock new characters to pick from, a small village-building system, and more as you break the walls of the encroaching enemies. Ball X Pit is a master at giving you that \"one more run\" itch.\n\nRead our review of Ball X Pit here\n\nIf you are \n\nRead our review of Blue Prince here\n\nWould you trust your best friends to help you climb a mountain? What about your family? Well, wonder no longer, as, thanks to indie developer Team Peak, you will now be able to do just that (in a safe, non-real-world scenario) with Peak. This cooperative climbing adventure puts you and your friends in a predicament that requires you to scale a tall mountain in order to survive. With cute visuals, proximity chat, climbing items to help you, and more, all helped push Peak to the top of Steam charts this year, and it is a great time to check out while on break this holiday.\n\nCheck out a bit of the history behind Peak here\n\nWhether it's Ultimate, Brawl, Melee, or any of the other variations, I have never attended a gathering that Super Smash Bros. hasn't improved. The chaos of 8-man multiplayer, the tense edge-of-your-seat sudden death matches, and the exultation of come-from-behind wins help keep Smash Brothers from ever getting old. While the world anxiously waits for the word of a Switch 2 Smash, the old versions are just as fun to revisit, so grab some controllers and prepare to fight!\n\nRead our review of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate here",

When that didn't happen, he found a way to remain close to the action — interning at Madison Square Garden, joining the 2014 Super Bowl host committee, and completing the NFL's rotational program across media, business development, and strategy.\n\nHe thought he'd stay there and ascend the ranks. But he decided on a different path that seemed to align more with his interests: finance.\n\nAfter earning his MBA and working in investment banking, he joined Blue Owl's HomeCourt Partners, a fund established with the NBA to buy minority stakes in teams.\n\nCardinez has since worked on multiple franchise deals, including the Phoenix Suns' $4 billion sale and a 2024 transaction involving the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nKress' path to high finance began in academic research, studying anthropology and psychology at Notre Dame and conducting fieldwork in Sierra Leone before pursuing graduate work on Angola's energy sector at the University of Oxford. She later worked at political research and consultancy firm, Eurasia Group, training investors to integrate geopolitical risk into decision-making.\n\nKress came to BlackRock first as an advisor to Tom Donilon, the former US national security advisor, a post she called a \"dream job.\" She helped Donilon elevate the firm's geopolitics function into a permanent part of the BlackRock Investment Institute.\n\nBut she didn't stop there. This year, Kress was named the chief of staff to Larry Fink, the firm's powerful CEO. She told Business Insider that this new job was the \"culmination\" of her career, offering \"unparalleled exposure\" to global policymakers and business leaders.\n\nJack Levendoski, JPMorgan Chase\n\nLevendoski grew up all over the world — from Louisiana to London, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Australia — before beginning his career as a facilities engineering project manager at Chevron.\n\nIn that role, he supported offshore oil and gas work in the Gulf of Mexico. Levendoski later moved into investment banking and is now an executive director in JPMorgan's M&A group, advising on high-profile technology and software transactions.\n\nMenasche admits he didn't always feel like a natural fit for the finance industry — he didn't grow up in a household of bankers, he said, and he studied chemistry and math at Cambridge. But after trying academic research, he found the lab's pace too slow. That realization led him to roles that blended analytical work with more day-to-day momentum, eventually steering him into secondaries.\n\nToday, Menasche is a managing director and global cohead of Goldman Sachs' private capital and liquidity solutions group, working across real estate, infrastructure, private equity, and venture capital transactions.\n\nJackie Shepherd, Morgan Stanley\n\nBefore joining the ranks of Wall Street, Shepherd spent years competing in Division I golf, earning a full-ride scholarship and captaining the University of Minnesota's team. She began her career in accounting at EY's international tax practice, where she first encountered investment banking.\n\n\"I didn't realize that there was an intersection between the two,\" she told Business Insider. \"I wanted to be the person coming up with more of the cool ideas.\" So she made the pivot to Wall Street.\n\nAfter holding roles at Goldman Sachs and Citi, she joined Morgan Stanley's separations and structured solutions group. Shepherd has worked on roughly $250 billion in transactions, including Comcast's pending carve-out of its cable networks.\n\nGolf, she said, remains a key part of her life, adding that aspires to play on all seven continents.",
