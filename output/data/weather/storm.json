    "title": "Would you shovel snow after a historic blizzard for $30 an hour? These 3 New Yorkers did",
    "description": "All three said they enjoyed their experience shoveling snow but said there was one area that needed improvement: the shovels themselves.",
    "fullText": "When a historic winter storm buried parts of New York City under as much as 20 inches of snow, City Hall turned to an unlikely workforce: everyday New Yorkers.\n\nIn a video that quickly ricocheted across social media, the city's online-native mayor, Zohran Mamdani, urged residents to sign up as emergency snow shovelers.\n\nThe program began in 1897, according to The City. This year, Mamdani sweetened the longtime program.\n\n\"Due to the historic nature of this blizzard, we've increased pay to $30 an hour,\" Mamdani said. \"Grab a shovel, bundle up, and be part of getting our city back in business as you help us clear snow on crosswalks, bus stops, and fire hydrants.\"\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with three residents who answered that call, bundling up and heading to their local sanitation depots. They described sore backs, soaked boots, and — perhaps unexpectedly — a renewed sense of civic pride.\n\nA post shared by Mayor Zohran Kwame Mamdani (@nycmayor)\n\nFor Barbara Leung, a 36-year-old sales operations director who lives in Gramercy, the decision to spend 12 hours shoveling in Chinatown wasn't about the money.\n\n\"I wanted to give back to the community,\" she told Business Insider. \"I see these people every day — and I think of my mom and my relatives. I don't want my mom to have to step into a puddle or slip on ice. It's like, 'Oh, I can make someone else's mom's life better, too.'\"\n\nHer conversations with coworkers were largely tactical — how to chip away at packed corners, how to widen a path for strollers — but they still felt camaraderie.\n\n\"I normally wouldn't meet these people,\" she added. \"I haven't done something like this for a while where I got to interact with a bunch of people, and we all had a common goal.\"\n\nThank you Purple Gatorade Angel 🙏🏼💜🙌🏼 #nyc #snow #snowstorm #blizzard #snowremoval\n\nIn East Harlem, Stephen Bolles, a 33-year-old stand-up comedian who juggles several handyman gigs, said his temporary co-workers were jovial.\n\nOn Monday, he shoveled with a group of about 15 people. By Wednesday, the crew had grown to 25. Neighbors stopped to give thanks, and one man handed his group a large jug of purple Gatorade.\n\n\"The community really came together, especially where I'm at,\" Bolles said. \"It was probably one of the most community-driven things I've done in this neighborhood.\"\n\nCiara Leynes, a 29-year-old former real estate agent in Astoria who is unemployed, said the shoveling appeal was straightforward.\n\n\"I'm unemployed, I'm trying my best to get a job,\" she said. \"People are willing to work — they want to work. You just have to pay them and give them an opportunity.\"\n\nBolles said his roommate first sent him a TikTok about the program when it was advertised at $20 an hour.\n\n\"It's a low-money month for me,\" he said. He signed up that Sunday, filled out paperwork in about 15 minutes, and shoveled on Monday and Wednesday.\n\n\"Anything less than $30 an hour would have been criminal,\" he said. \"This was one of the more brutal upper-body workouts I've ever done for a job.\"\n\nBoth Leynes and Bolles said the cash would help them pay for essentials.\n\nI talked myself into this one ❄️😑🪏 #emergencyshovel #nyc #fyp #blizzard #snow\n\nFor the shovelers in Chinatown, Leung said the quick cash was important.\n\n\"There were folks that really needed the money, and said, 'I can finally have a hot meal and get groceries,'\" she said.\n\nJosh Goodman, the Department of Sanitation's deputy commissioner for public affairs and customer experience, told Business Insider that the city streamlined the program this year to help get the cash out quickly. All shovelers should expect payments within 2 to 6 weeks, depending on when they helped, he said.\n\nMore than 7,000 New Yorkers are now registered as emergency snow shovelers this season — the most ever, Goodman added.\n\nFor some shovelers, the effort doubled as a quiet show of support for the city's new mayor.\n\n\"We were saying, 'Go Mamdani,'\" Bolles joked. \"I kept saying, 'Let's ditch this place and go shovel out Gracie Mansion.'\"\n\nHe also said the program gave him a new respect for the Sanitation Department's work — and that it meaningfully improved pathways compared to recent other snowstorms.\n\n\"The sidewalks are so clear this time around,\" he added. \"They did not make this $30 an hour announcement during the last blizzard, and there is a palpable difference.\"\n\nIn Astoria, Leynes was similarly enthusiastic. \"I'm a fan of Mamdani, I would say,\" she said.\n\nA post shared by Barb Leung (@barbleung)\n\nAll three shovelers said some of the tools left something to be desired.\n\n\"It was easy to break the shovels,\" Leynes said, though she joked that she didn't manage to snap one herself because she wasn't lifting especially heavy loads. \"The guys were doing a lot of the heavy lifting. I tried my best, but I just felt like I was getting in the way.\"\n\nBolles agreed: \"Some of the shovels were not particularly great,\" he said.\n\nGoodman said the department had not received complaints. \"These are the same shovels we have always used,\" he said, adding that officials would be \"happy to look into it.\"\n\nFlimsy plastic aside, the sidewalks in many neighborhoods are now largely passable — carved out by thousands of residents who traded a night of sleep for sore shoulders and a $30 hourly wage.\n\nFor the three who spoke to Business Insider, it was also a chance to feel like the city was theirs to dig out together — one shovel-full of snow at a time.",

    "fullText": "Many people have perfected the art of sleeping on airplanes. That's especially true for those who frequently find themselves on redeye flights. However, hundreds of people in Germany found themselves trying to get some shuteye while forced to wait out a storm on the tarmac, when airline officials grounded six planes.\n\nHowever, when it became clear the flights wouldn't be cleared for takeoff until the following day, the passengers were left to wait in their seats overnight, creating a messy situation for the travelers. Now the airline and airport officials are apologizing for their mistakes.\n\nSome of the upper brass at Munich Airport and Lufthansa spent their Friday apologizing to passengers after both men took responsibility for mistakes that left around 600 people on grounded planes in a snowstorm. The incident happened on Feb. 19, according to Yahoo News, when inclement weather prompted them to close the skies for a bit, which prevented the planes from departing before the city's 1 a.m. travel curfew.\n\nHowever, those in charge failed to notify the firefighters who normally would've come in and removed the passengers from the plane, resulting in a tense night for travelers. \"We didn't manage it well,\" Thomas Hoff Andersson, Munich airport's managing director of aviation and operations said in a press conference.\n\n\"We made mistakes that night,\" Heiko Reitz, one of Lufthansa board member's added. \"Incidents like this cannot be allowed to happen.\"\n\nThe executives said that they made the decision not to alert the emergency personnel since the passengers were in no danger, a decision they both later came to regret.\n\nBusiness Insider was able to connect with some of those 600 people left on the planes, and they opened up about what it was like onboard. \"There was no food or drink for us,\" Søren Thieme revealed. \"There were no blankets for us either.\" Apparently, when passengers asked about getting off the planes and heading back into the airport to wait, they were told that it was forbidden.\n\nHowever, a Lufthansa spokesperson denied those claims, and told Business Insider that the passengers were well cared for, saying, \"The crews kept passengers informed and provided them with the catering available on board, as far as possible. All aircraft were heated and had sufficient power.\"\n\nPlanes can get grounded for all kinds of reasons. And while that situation was definitely an unusual one, U.S. travelers do have some recourse when it comes to being waylaid mid-flight. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), airlines have to de-board any planes that are expected to be delayed by more than three hours for domestic flights and four hours on international ones.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions to that rule, according to the DOT, and you cannot get off the plane when:\n\nWhen air traffic control prohibits the deboarding\n\nI can't think of a worse way to start your vacation, which is why it's important to consider reading up on your rights about delays before your next flight. Otherwise, you may find yourself in an uncomfortable situation like the German travelers did.",

    "description": "A storm of layoffs is upon us, and tech career coach Kyle Elliott shared mistakes he helps his clients avoid.",
    "fullText": "More than 1.1 million people were laid off in the US in 2025, and there were more job cuts in January 2026 than any January since 2009, according to reports. Business leaders are predicting that things will only get worse as AI disrupts the workforce.\n\nWhen Amazon announced layoffs earlier this year, the tech career coach Kyle Elliott shared what he thinks employees should do immediately after being laid off to put them in the best position to find a new role.\n\nHe also shared three common mistakes to avoid after a layoff.\n\nAfter the sting of a layoff, Elliott has seen workers turn to LinkedIn to share negative posts about their former employer.\n\n\"Sometimes people just really react from that emotion or wound, instead of waiting until it heals,\" he said.\n\nSuch posts could be detrimental when applying for a new job, when recruiters and hiring managers check your LinkedIn profile.\n\n\"People want to work with other positive people, so if they see that you're venting, they may worry, 'if we have to conduct layoffs in the future, are you going to then put a hit piece out on us as soon as you get laid off?\" Elliott said.\n\nInstead, consider waiting until you are more able to position the event differently in your post, which could be a month or two after, Elliot said. In the post, share lessons you learned and the amazing work you did at your previous company, he added.\n\nFormer colleagues can be a good resource when you're looking for jobs in the future. In your last conversation with your former colleagues before leaving the company, reiterate the work you're proud of and share what kind of opportunity you're looking for next, Elliott said.\n\nWith this in mind, it may be better to vent about your layoff experience to a trusted confidant like a spouse, best friend, or therapist rather than a former colleague, he added.\n\nVenting to a colleague could damage their perception of you and jeopardize the connection.\n\n\"A lot of people will remember that last piece, and you don't want them to be like, 'oh, they're bitter.'\" he said.\n\nElliott has noticed that clients are sometimes afraid to network because of the stigma associated with layoffs, and their fear that they can't add value to conversations while unemployed.\n\n\"Layoffs are normal now,\" Elliott said, so there's no need to avoid reaching out to people out of fear.\n\nHe recommended starting small. For example, meet a former colleague whom you were close to.\n\nIn your first conversation, focus on putting yourself out there and taking small steps toward your next role, and don't expect to be offered a job, he said.\n\n\"If you were fired and you're calling it a layoff, it's a little different. But if you were truly just laid off as part of a reorganization or cost-cutting measures, people understand that, and there shouldn't be shame in that,\" he said.",

    "description": "The storm is unlikely to rival the blizzard from February, but may hit some different locations.",
    "fullText": "Another significant winter storm is in the forecast — this time for early March, forecasters said.\n\n\"Fresh Arctic air will set the stage for a storm early next week that could bring disruptive snow and ice to parts of the Midwest and Northeast,\" said AccuWeather meteorologist Alex Sosnowski in an online forecast.\n\nHowever, \"before the bigger storm threat arrives, smaller wintry events will move through the regions,\" he said.\n\nFollowing a minor event Thursday, Feb. 26, a narrow swath of snow is then forecast to develop Friday, Feb. 27 into Saturday night, Feb. 28 ahead of a surge of Arctic air plunging southeastward from Canada, AccuWeather said.\n\nThe snow will begin in Montana Friday, Feb. 27, spread into the Midwest Friday night and reach the interior Northeast Saturday night, Feb. 28. Most areas will pick up a coating to a couple of inches, Sosnowski said.\n\nChicago, Minneapolis and Detroit may pick up an inch or so from Friday night to Saturday night.\n\nA key ingredient in major winter storms is fresh cold air — and next week’s system will have plenty in place.\n\nWith fresh Arctic air in place, warm and moist air colliding with the cold air may produce widespread snow, sleet and freezing rain across parts of the Great Lakes and Northeast.\n\nThe National Weather Service said that \"while this is not expected to be a blockbuster storm, it does seem probable that plowable snow and some ice will occur. Snow is currently expected across portions of the Mid-Mississippi Valley, Ohio Valley, and Mid-Atlantic.\"\n\n\"Just to the south, this pattern will also favor a swath of mixed precipitation like sleet and freezing rain. Accumulations and track of the wintry weather remain uncertain, so continue to monitor forecasts,\" the weather service said.\n\nSnow and ice totals will depend on the storm’s track and strength, AccuWeather said. \"Some areas that missed the recent Blizzard of 2026 could receive several inches of snow and/or some ice this time,\" Sosnowski said.\n\nThis storm is highly unlikely to rival the blizzard from February, especially across the coastal Northeast. However, some areas that got little or no snow from that storm in the Northeast or Midwest could pick up several inches of snow and/or some ice, AccuWeather said.\n\nThe risk of travel disruptions will increase from Monday, March 2 through Wednesday, March 4, depending on the storm’s exact track and strength. Major airport hubs from Washington, DC, and Philadelphia to New York City, Boston, Detroit and Chicago could be affected.\n\nWhere rain falls, most likely in parts of the Ohio Valley and mid-Atlantic states, urban flooding is possible. A farther north track could elevate the risk of ice jams and related stream and river flooding, AccuWeather warned.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Early March forecast warns Northeast of another snowstorm",

The vehicle was covered in snow and not running.\n\nBoutros, a student at Salve Regina University, was transported by the Newport Fire Rescue to the Newport Hospital Emergency Room, where he was pronounced dead as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning, the NPD said.

    "fullText": "As the Northeast U.S. begins to dig out from a powerful blizzard, more than two dozen flights in and out of Southwest Florida International Airport (RSW) in Fort Myers were canceled on Tuesday, Feb. 24, according to FlightAware.\n\nThe blizzard caused over 2,000 U.S. flights to be canceled Tuesday, with the bulk of disruptions in and around New York, Boston and Philadelphia.\n\nAcross Florida airports, 114 flights were delayed and around 385 canceled, with most at Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, Miami and Tampa.\n\nOn Monday, Feb. 23, the winter storm caused at least 90 cancellations and 15 delays at RSW.\n\nAirlines, including American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, Southwest and United Airlines, are waiving change fees and fare differences for those who planned to travel to the hardest-hit areas and now need to change plans.\n\nAccording to FlightAware.com, which provides real-time flight information, as of 7:30 a.m., the following delays and cancellations of flights have been reported within, into or out of the United States today, Feb. 24:\n\nFlight cancellations and delays at RSW as of 10 a.m., Feb. 23, according to FlightAware:\n\nHere's the breakdown by airport as of around 7:30 a.m. Feb. 24. Click the airport names for detailed flight info and updated numbers throughout the day.\n\nDon't wait until you're already at the airport to check your flight. Monitor your flight early and often, starting now, as cancellations will increase as the weather conditions worsen.\n\nDownload your airline’s mobile app and turn on push and text notifications for alerts about your flight. Some apps have a “Where’s My Plane?” feature that lets you see whether the aircraft scheduled to operate your flight has arrived, is delayed en route, or hasn’t departed yet from its previous airport. That can be an early signal of trouble.\n\nIf your flight is canceled, use the airline's mobile app to rebook as soon as possible, according to Scott Keyes, founder of Going. If you need to talk to someone, Keyes suggests calling one of the carrier’s international lines.\n\n\"The best thing travelers can do is to be as proactive as possible switching to a new flight,” Keyes told USA TODAY. “When a flight gets canceled, all of a sudden hundreds of passengers need new itineraries. There may only be a handful of seats left on the best flights, and it's a first-come, first-(served) endeavor.”\n\nIf your flight is canceled for any reason, you’re entitled to a full refund if you choose not to fly on alternative itineraries offered by your airline.

    "fullText": "An entire Eastern Shore town was without power Monday as widespread outages hit the region after a heavy snowstorm.\n\nA Delmarva Power outage map showed nearly 1,000 outages Monday morning, affecting more than 6% of the utility’s 550,000 customers in Maryland and Delaware. Choptank Electric Cooperative reported nearly 27% of its 57,000 customers were without power as of early Monday.\n\nBerlin Mayor Zack Tyndall took to Facebook to provide an update early Monday morning. Tyndall said the town lost power at roughly 9 p.m. Sunday.\n\nBerlin is unique on the Eastern Shore in that it operates its own municipal electric utility, serving local homes and businesses directly. The town generates some electricity at a small power plant on William Street but purchases most of its power from outside suppliers. That electricity is delivered into Berlin through the regional transmission grid, which in much of the area is operated by Delmarva Power.\n\nTyndall said the issue, in this case, was with Delmarva Power.\n\n“Town crews have spent the evening working to clear down trees and wires, plow the streets, and fix issues related to the storm and power outage,” Tyndall wrote. “Unfortunately, the source of the issue is not a Berlin Electric issue but an issue with electricity coming into town from Delmarva Power.”\n\nTyndall asked for patience as town crews and Delmarva Power worked to restore service.\n\nHe also urged residents to stay off the streets.\n\n“You will get stuck and cause a strain on town resources,” he said. “This storm has caused extremely high snow drifts and areas that have been impossible to keep clear due to heavy winds. Leaving your house poses not only a risk for you but our town staff and local first responders who will have to come rescue you.”\n\nTyndall told The Baltimore Sun Delmarva Power crews hope to restore service by noon Monday.\n\nDelmarva Power did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHave a news tip?

    "description": "A 75-year-old New Jersey man flew to Puerto Vallarta to avoid a blizzard, only to get stranded amid cartel violence. Now he's trying to get back home.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Brian Thompson, 75, who lives in New Jersey. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nOn February 21, my wife and I traveled to Puerto Vallarta, just in time to miss a historic blizzard hitting the Jersey Shore.\n\nWhen we were planning this trip, it seemed like a good idea to miss a couple of winter weeks by traveling to Puerto Vallarta, where I'd visited twice before.\n\nPeople describe Puerto Vallarta as a little bit of paradise. Locals and tourists here are very friendly. It's a vibrant, bustling city with a great jazz scene.\n\nI'd never felt unsafe here until yesterday. I woke up in the morning and saw what I thought was pollution from automobile exhaust, but when I went down to the front door of the condominium, people said we were under attack by the cartel.\n\nAt first, we stayed in our unit because we were told to shelter in place. I went up to the condominium's front door to see what was going on, but I didn't go any further. I spent the next few hours communicating with family and friends who wanted to know if we were OK.\n\nLater on, I went out onto the pool deck and could see new fires and smoke, and a helicopter circling. I saw multiple videos online of vehicles being burned in the area.\n\nThe scariest part was hearing that the restaurant adjoining our building was on fire. Fortunately, it was quickly put out, but I could see smoke coming across our balcony.\n\nThis morning, it looks like things have calmed down. My wife struggled to fall asleep last night. I've been worried about her, but I've only felt a little bit scared. For the most part, my adrenaline was high. I've spent my career as a television journalist, and I'm used to running toward trouble. I decided to report on the events to my audience by sending information to my friends and people on X.\n\nWe spent last night with some other residents in the condo, and they shared their food with us.\n\nWhen my wife and I arrived on Saturday, we didn't have much food with us. I'd brought three protein bars with me, and we'd gotten a few items from a local store, including chips, guacamole, and yogurt. I haven't tried to leave the condo yet today. Whether I will or not depends partly on whether my wife will let me.\n\nWe planned to travel to Mexico City after spending a week in Puerto Vallarta, but we've canceled that leg of our trip.\n\nSo far, it's been hard to get flights out of the area. The earliest trips I've been able to find are on this Friday and Saturday, and I've booked trips back to the US through both Houston and Los Angeles.\n\nI'm hoping New Jersey will have dug itself out from the blizzard by Friday, but I haven't booked our travel from Houston to New Jersey because I don't even know if we'll make it to Houston.\n\nI don't know if we'll come back to Puerto Vallarta, but I hope we will. I want to come back to support the people of Puerto Vallarta and show faith in their country.\n\nDo you have a story to share about being stuck on holiday in Mexico?

    "description": "Nearly 9,000 flights have been canceled as a winter storm pummels the northeast, alongside a partial government shutdown and cartel violence.",
    "fullText": "Weather, violence, and political quarrelling have combined to make a real headache for American travelers this week.\n\nNearly 9,000 flights were canceled within, into, or out of the US on Sunday and Monday, according to data from FlightAware.\n\nThe vast majority of those came as a winter storm pummeled the northeast. More than 90% of flights out of Newark Liberty, Boston Logan, and LaGuardia Airports were canceled on Monday, with 89% canceled at JFK, per FlightAware.\n\nNew York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani declared a state of emergency and issued a travel ban. It was also the city's first blizzard warning for nine years.\n\nWith huge amounts of snow falling and bad weather expected to continue until at least Wednesday, disruptions are likely to be ongoing.\n\nMeanwhile, anybody hoping to find some winter sun in Mexico may have had their hopes dashed.\n\nCartel violence erupted in parts of the country on Sunday after its military killed \"El Mencho,\" the leader of the Jalisco New Generation drug cartel.\n\nPuerto Vallarta, in Jalisco, is a particularly popular destination for US and Canadian tourists. Cars and stores were set on fire there, while airlines canceled 139 flights in and out of the resort town.\n\nOn Monday morning, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said in a press conference that the situation had de-escalated, saying that an extra 2,500 armed personnel had been sent to the state since the violence began.\n\nWith US citizens in Jalisco and other parts of Mexico advised to shelter in place, many tourists may be rethinking their plans. Some airlines waived change fees for flights to Puerto Vallarta and Guadalajara through Wednesday.\n\nIf your flight isn't canceled this week, it's possible that getting to your gate could be more difficult than normal.\n\nThe partial government shutdown is also causing delays and confusion at airport security. Trouble began on February 14 after Democrats and the White House reached a stalemate over funding for the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nFederal officials said both TSA PreCheck and Global Entry would be suspended starting Sunday morning.\n\nHowever, the Transportation Security Administration then said PreCheck — which lets travelers move through security faster — would actually still be available.\n\nLos Angeles International Airport had posted on social media that it was diverting all PreCheck customers to general screening lanes, but later removed the post.\n\n\"As staffing constraints arise, TSA will evaluate on a case-by-case basis and adjust operations accordingly,\" the DHS said in a statement.\n\nGlobal Entry, which speeds up customs screening for fliers entering the US, is still suspended. DHS said officers assigned to process these travelers will be reassigned to process others.\n\nThe shutdown looks set to last longer still.\n\nRepublicans want an extra $64.4 billion in funding for DHS — including $10 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But Democrats want reforms in the wake of the turmoil in Minneapolis, as two people there were killed by ICE last month.",

Space heaters in particular should be placed on a flat, hard surface at least 3 feet from anything flammable. And never use your oven to heat your home.\n\nCrumple the papers and stuff them under clothes to keep warm, de Vulpillieres said.\n\nSand can help the tires move on slippery ice and snow. Salt can also help prevent the resulting slush from freezing again.\n\nIf you happen to have some in your car, it's worth using to get unstuck.\n\nThe mats can be placed under the tires to keep them from slipping.\n\nIn a pinch, pine needles and sticks can increase traction.\n\nAdding weight to a car by pushing down on the hood or placing rocks on top of it can help increase traction when attempting to drive out of snow.\n\nPulling a car out of a ditch is the most effective way to move it.\n\n\"In snow, it's better to pull than to push,\" de Vulpillieres said.\n\nCooking spray can be used to keep car doors from freezing shut by spraying the corners. Spraying your snow shovel can also keep snow from sticking to it.\n\nIf you don't have a snow brush or an ice scraper in your car, the edges of a credit card can get the job done.",

It will be nonexistent.\n\nNew York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani declared a state of emergency and a travel ban during a press conference on Sunday as a giant winter storm bore down on much of the Northeast.\n\nThe National Weather Service said to expect blizzard conditions and up to 20 inches of snow over the next 24 hours. Parts of New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts could get up to 25 inches.\n\n\"The state of emergency closes the streets, highways, and bridges of New York City for all traffic,\" Mamdani said. The travel ban begins at 9 p.m. Sunday and lasts until 12 p.m. on Monday. DoorDash, notably, also said it was suspending deliveries Sunday night.\n\nUS airlines, meanwhile, are canceling and delaying thousands of flights. As of Sunday afternoon, airlines had canceled over 3,000 flights and delayed over 2,900, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware.\n\nNew York City's John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia airports have the highest number of cancellations, followed by Newark Liberty International Airport, Philadelphia International Airport, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, and Boston Logan International Airport.\n\nAnyone hoping to catch a flight in the region on Monday can also expect major disruptions, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics company. At LaGuardia Airport, for example, 82% of flights scheduled for Monday have been canceled.\n\nAdding to what will likely be a chaotic 48 hours for travelers, the Department of Homeland Security announced Saturday night that it was suspending TSA PreCheck and Global Entry due to the partial government shutdown.\n\nDespite the announcement, however, TSA Precheck and Global Entry lanes remained open at major airports on Sunday. In a statement, the Transportation Security Administration said it is evaluating the situation \"case-by-case.\"\n\n\"At this time, TSA PreCheck remains operational with no change for the traveling public,\" a spokesperson said. \"As staffing constraints arise, TSA will evaluate on a case-by-case basis and adjust operations accordingly.\"\n\nThe federal government entered a partial shutdown earlier this month, delaying funding for some agencies, like DHS.

    "fullText": "With sensors that cool the air as it nears your head, this high-end tool promises gentler styling for sensitive scalps\n\nThe best hair dryers for smooth, speedy styling at home\n\nTell most hair-care enthusiasts you want to upgrade your hair dryer, and I’d bet good money you’ll be asked, “Will you buy a Dyson?” That would have been a ludicrous question more than a decade ago when the brand specialised in vacuum cleaners, but not since it took the luxury hair-care market by storm in 2016 with its Supersonic hair dryer.\n\nThe Supersonic ripped up the hair-dryer rulebook, with its distinctive design, lightweight feel and quiet operation. Eight years after the original, Dyson launched the Supersonic Nural: an upgraded version with new tricks up its sleeve.\n\nUpgrading to one of the best hair dryers is still one of my top beauty tips: they’re better at controlling heat levels and dry hair faster. All the same, is there really any need to spend up to £400?\n\nHaving put the Supersonic Nural hair dryer through its paces and compared it with 19 other hair dryers that I tested, I was mostly impressed. Still, a few niggles ensure it’s not a recommendation without caveats.\n\nOver the month I tested the Supersonic Nural, I took note of the look, feel and finish of my hair. I timed how long it took to rough-dry hair and achieve a smooth blow-dry, and judged the effectiveness of the scalp-protect mode, as well as the versatility and intuitiveness of the controls for more precise styling.\n\nI also used all of the attachments. In each case, I was hoping to dry my hair quickly, leaving it with minimal frizz and feeling healthy. Comfort was also a factor: I didn’t want my arms to ache or to feel any wrist strain in use.\n\nFor more quantitative test results, I used an anemometer to measure the Supersonic Nural’s top wind speed, plus a sound meter to assess noise levels from 15cm away. I popped this data into my comparison spreadsheet to see how the hair dryer measured up to the competition.\n\nDyson hair dryers are notoriously expensive. Prices start at £219 for the original Supersonic with its concentrator nozzle attachment, and climb to £450 for the latest Supersonic R hair dryer – the smallest, lightest and most powerful model that Dyson offers.\n\nSitting slightly below the Supersonic R is the £400 Supersonic Nural. As with its stablemates, it comes with intelligent heat control to prevent the excessive temperatures that can damage hair, and uses Dyson’s patented Air Multiplier technology to draw in surrounding air through the ring shape, for a claimed three times more airflow over models with a conventional shape.\n\nThe Nural uses the Dyson Digital Motor V9, the same motor as the original Supersonic. This is marginally heavier and less powerful than the Hyperdymium motor in the brand’s Supersonic R hair dryer, but still spins at a whopping 110,000 RPM. That’s plenty fast enough for most people.\n\nOn a basic level, the Nural has three speed levels, three heat settings and a continuous cool shot. All these can be controlled by small buttons on the rear of the dryer, alongside a button that turns scalp-protect mode on and off. On the handle, there’s a dedicated cool shot button and a power switch. It has a 2.62m cord, which is perfect for home use.\n\nThe most tangible difference between the original and the Nural is its scalp-protect mode. This sees the device adjust the temperature of the air based on the dryer’s proximity to the scalp: the closer it gets, the lower the temperature goes. This means you never burn your scalp or frazzle any of the delicate new strands as they grow. Dyson claims this strengthens the scalp barrier, balances oils on the scalp, and reduces visible flakes and shedding.\n\nAnother clever addition is pause detect, which automatically slows the dryer down when it’s placed on a surface. This is ideal for those who section their hair while drying, or place the dryer down during a round-brush blow-dry.\n\nDyson offers eight different magnetic attachments for the Nural. Whether you buy the version for straight and wavy or for curly and coily hair, you’ll find five attachments in the box, with others available to buy separately.\n\nAll the Nural’s attachments have RFID tags that are programmed with the ideal heat and speed settings, eliminating any guesswork on the user’s part. If you prefer to tweak the settings, it will then remember these the next time you use that attachment.\n\nThat, alongside the high-end design, is one of the main reasons to invest in a Dyson hair dryer over other high-end options. Most of its competitors only include a concentrator nozzle and diffuser, with the closest equivalent in attachment range being the £220 Shark SpeedStyle Pro. The Shark also features a Scalp Shield mode, but it’s not automatic or proximity-based like the Nural’s. Instead it’s activated via a button on the handle (so no different from simply reducing the temperature on any old dryer).\n\nPower: 1,600W\nMotor speed: 110,000 RPM \nTemperature settings: three, plus a cold shot\nSpeed settings: three\nAttachments: \n\n Straight + Wavy version: diffuser, flyaway smoother, smoothing nozzle, gentle air attachment, concentrator nozzle\nCurly + Coily version: gentle air attachment, wave+curl diffuser, wide-tooth comb, flyaway attachment, concentrator nozzle\nWeight: 485g (without wire)\nMaximum wind speed (tested): 29.2m/s\nVolume range (tested): 75-81dB\n\nThere’s much to like about the Supersonic Nural. Its design is attractive – it’s made from a lightweight-but-sturdy plastic, with a metallic finish that screams high-end. I tested the Nural in the limited-edition Amber Silk colour, but it’s also available in blush pink, navy or dark blue. There have been various limited-edition colours, too, so it’s always worth checking the Dyson website before you buy.\n\nIts vegan leather presentation case – which is free in some limited editions, but costs £60 separately – is another luxury. It houses all the attachments – bar one, which I’ll moan about momentarily. If you prefer to ditch the case, the dryer is compact enough to fit in most vanity drawers.\n\nThe Nural is staggeringly quiet, with volume levels ranging between 75 and 81dB in my tests. That makes it the second quietest hair dryer I’ve tested, just a touch louder than the Cloud Nine Airshot Pro on its fastest settings.\n\nI adored the scalp-protect mode, which made drying my hair comfortable and allowed me to disengage during the process. This isn’t a luxury I get with most hair dryers, which require me to manually lower the temperature at the scalp, or suffer the consequences.\n\nThe dryer took about seven minutes to rough-dry my hair, which is a few minutes slower than the most powerful hair dryers I’ve tested. However, my hair was left feeling smooth and healthy, with the flyaway attachment quickly handling any rogue hairs for an effortless finish that lasted until my next wash. The magnetic attachments were easy to swap, and the automatic settings meant I could make the most of them without faff.\n\nI’m not a fan of doing round-brush blow-drys: I haven’t quite got the knack of using a round brush, so I’m often left sweating profusely, with my arms feeling as if I’ve done 40 reps by the end. But the Supersonic Nural’s lightweight, evenly weighted design made sure my arms and wrists didn’t feel the strain, even when tackling the tricky spots on the top of my head. And when sectioning my hair, the pause detect was an invaluable little luxury that I’ll miss when I’m using a different hair dryer.\n\nThe results from the blow-dry were beautifully smooth, with plenty of volume where I wanted it. The Dyson’s speed settings provided extra control when styling the shorter hairs that frame my face, and the cool shot set the style quickly. My hair felt noticeably smoother than usual, thanks to having been dried with more gentle heat.\n\nLet’s start with the obvious: the Supersonic Nural is expensive. At full price, you’ll be splashing out about £400 (although you could find one for about £300 at the time of writing). There’s definitely no need to spend that much, with plenty of equally powerful options available for less in our test of the best hair dryers.\n\nIf you have a sensitive scalp and are tired of accidentally scorching it, no other hair dryer offers the same automation as Dyson’s scalp-protect mode. That said, the sensor isn’t flawless. During testing, it would sometimes lower the temperature when there was no need to. Mercifully, it never incorrectly increased the temperature in my tests, but I found the random lower temperatures slightly frustrating, since this added to overall drying times. You can easily disable scalp protect mode, of course, but you’d be missing out on one of the key selling points.\n\nAnother gripe was that the presentation case – as gorgeous as it looks – didn’t have enough space to store all the attachments. No matter how much rejigging I did, I couldn’t get the diffuser attachment to fit, meaning I had to let it gather dust on top of the case. For a case this expensive, that isn’t good enough.\n\nFinally – and this is nitpicking – when I unboxed the hair dryer, I was prompted to download the MyDyson app. Now, I’m not a fan of having random apps clogging up my phone, but I will be happy to do so if useful features are on offer. Sadly, all you get with the Supersonic Nural is styling and maintenance advice – which is available online. If you buy the Nural, do yourself a favour and skip the app.\n\nAll Dyson hair-care products, including the Supersonic Nural, are covered by a two-year warranty. During that time, Dyson will repair or replace your hair dryer if it stops working. You can also buy spare parts and replacement attachments from Dyson, which arrive with a one-year warranty.\n\nAs with all Dyson hair stylers, the Nural has a filter that needs cleaning once a month, or when you see the LED cleaning light switch on. This is easy to do: remove the filter cover at the bottom of the hair dryer’s handle and gently clear out any dust with a small cleaning brush. If necessary, you can use soapy water, but you’ll need to wait for the filter to fully dry before reassembling. Full cleaning instructions can be found in the instruction manual or on Dyson’s YouTube channel.\n\nYou can also find product-specific troubleshooting tips on the Dyson support page, which is exactly where you’ll be directed if you Dyson also has a helpline (0800 298 0298) where you can book a repair if your model is under warranty.\n\nIf your Dyson kicks the bucket after its warranty expires, all isn’t necessarily lost. Secondhand sites such as Sell My Dyson will buy old Dyson hair dryers, to stop all the parts from going to waste.\n\nThere’s no getting past it – the Supersonic Nural is a brilliant hair dryer that is well suited to people with sensitive scalps. Scalp burn and frazzled hair will be a thing of the past; it’s staggeringly quiet with an attractive design, a clever pause-detect feature and a brilliant range of attachments. It’s a clear cut above hair dryers of old. Whether that’s worth £400 will, of course, depend on your budget.\n\nI’m not convinced. In fact, you can get a very good hair dryer for far less. For less than £150, you can buy the Head Jog Futaria hair dryer, which is lighter and faster. Or you could opt for the reliable Hershesons hair dryer, which is my top pick for most people. However, if you want to splash out on a luxury hair dryer and you have a sensitive scalp, you certainly won’t regret buying the Supersonic Nural.\n\nFor more:\n\n The best hair dryers for smooth and speedy styling\n\n The best hot brushes for a salon finish at home\n\n The best hair straighteners for foolproof styling\n\nSarah Matthews is a consumer journalist who specialises in health and beauty reviews.

    "description": "Compared to the previous several weeks in the D.C. region, this past week has not been so bad. Sure, it has been rather cloudy and chilly, but temperatures have been consistently above freezing, allow...",
    "fullText": "Weather models continue to debate the strength and position of a weekend storm system.\n\nThe most likely scenario involves rain on Sunday morning changing to mix and then wet snow by Sunday night.\n\nThe threat for accumulation has come up over the last 24 hours, with most models suggesting anywhere from 1-5\" of snowfall in the D.C. region.\n\nSome extreme solutions suggest 6\" or more could be possible.\n\nWASHINGTON - Compared to the previous several weeks in the D.C. region, this past week has not been so bad. Sure, it has been rather cloudy and chilly, but temperatures have been consistently above freezing, allowing the region to slowly but steadily free itself from the so-called \"snowcrete\" that has blanketed the D.C. area for the better part of a month now.\n\nTemperatures are expected to remain above freezing into the upcoming weekend, with the best day of the entire week potentially being Saturday, with partial sunshine and middle 50s expected in the afternoon.\n\nThe big question of course, is how much snow? It’s a question that remains relatively difficult to answer even with just a couple days to go ahead of the potential storm system.\n\nThe key to any potential storm system is its track, and its intensity. These are two features that weather models have continued to struggle with.\n\nOur general thoughts in the weather department this evening lead a little closer to the European model. With temperatures well above freezing at onset, the system would likely start as a predominantly rainfall event through the front part of the day on Sunday.\n\nThen, as a surface storm pushes eastward into the Atlantic, colder air fills in as the storm pulls away, along a weather feature known as an inverted surface trough. This would bring the risk for rain to change over to mix and a perhaps a period of potentially heavy, wet snowfall on Sunday night.\n\nNow, the tricky part of the forecast with an inverted trough situation is the area that gets accumulating snowfall tends to be in a relatively narrow band that follows the trough axis, so not everyone in the region would be looking as a decent snowfall, it would be localized in this banding.\n\nForecasting exactly where it would setup is very difficult, and we would not have a good idea of where this feature sets up until likely closer to Saturday evening.\n\nIf this solution, which the European Model has been hinting at for the last couple of days, is the correct solution, then parts of our region could see a 1-3\" with an upside risk of 3-6\" snowfall potential by the time the storm exits late Sunday night into early Monday morning.\n\nOn the other hand, you have the American model solution, which for the better part of a day now has suggested the storm could be much more impactful. With a stronger tilt in the jetstream, the weather model suggest that a more intense storm system will develop that stays much closer to the coastline. While it also starts as rainfall on Sunday morning, the intensifying surface low pulls cold air quickly into the storm, dropping temperatures in the DC region and changing rainfall over to a widespread heavy snowfall.\n\nThe model is aggressive with a heavy, impactful snowfall for everyone, with final snow totals in the double digits.\n\nNow, most forecasters agree this evening that this solution is rather extreme and unlikely to be the case with this storm. While we cannot rule it out of the realm of possibility, it is generally on its own, with most other guidance as of Thursday night suggesting lesser snowfall totals are more likely.\n\nYou can see the westward jump reflected in the 18z European Ensemble members as well. That's a pretty noticeable jump. \n\nNow again, it's not GFS level. Breaking down the numbers, European went up in every category. Most noticable...the threat for a 4\"+ snow event went from 30% to… pic.twitter.com/pr5tDqQIGQ\n\n— Mike Thomas (@MikeTFox5) February 20, 2026\n\nSo, if we do not believe the American model solution, what is the debate this evening? The issue lies in model consistency. Weather models have admittedly been extremely poor with the forecast solutions for the Sunday storm system. Even the European, which does have a history of being more accurate than the American model, has been extremely \"jumpy\" with this storm system. Sometimes jumping the system east, showing less snowfall, then bringing the storm back west, showing more snowfall. Forecasters look for run-to-run consistency, and so far we really have not seen that from any weather model just yet.\n\nThe reason why has everything to do with the pattern. It is not just one piece of atmospheric energy helping steer this storm system, but multiple. The more pieces you have involved with a developing storm system, the more prone you are to errors in the forecast. This is why we might not have a truly good hold on what this system could do in the DC region until closer to Friday night or even Saturday, when the energy pieces involved in the formation of this storm system are all well sampled and better analyzed.\n\nThis one is going to come down to the wire in terms of figuring out snowfall amounts. What I can guarantee is this will not be a repeat of the late January storm.\n\nTemperatures will not be as cold, even after the system — no \"snowcrete\" this time around. This would also be wet snow, and we would likely lose some to ground melt in areas no longer covered in snow from the January system, as temperatures have been above freezing much of this week.\n\nA key thing we want to mention: A lot of people are saying, \"but it is too warm to snow on Sunday! The Weather App says it will be in the 40s!\" While yes, this is too warm to snow at onset...remember that your weather app is giving you the high temperature for the day.\n\nThrough a process known as dynamic cooling, temperatures can cool as you bring in cooler air on the back side of a storm system, due to the upper-level trough swinging through. So, temperatures would be falling throughout the day.\n\nThe time frame we are most concerned with at the moment is Sunday afternoon and particularly the evening hours. While we do not anticipate at this time this will be a major, city shutdown type of snowfall, the most likely timing of it does mean that the risk is there for closures and delays to schools and other activities on Monday morning.\n\nOf course, how extensive these could be really depends on the final track and intensity of this storm system, and in the interest of forecast integrity we are not yet confident on any snowfall numbers to put out our expectations.\n\nWhat we will continue to do is keep you updated and informed ahead of this potential on Sunday.\n\nTo reiterate, at this time we are leaning towards the potential for a lower impact accumulating winter snowfall type event as opposed to a major snowstorm.\n\nFOX 5 will continue to monitor the threat and let you know if we think a more impactful system will hit the region.",

    "fullText": "Rapid uphill sprinting with skis on, lung-busting runs up steps with boots on and a downhill ski race to the finish line.\n\nThe new Winter Olympic sport of ski mountaineering - or skimo for short - made its highly anticipated debut on Thursday in blizzard conditions in Bormio.\n\nSwitzerland's Marianne Fatton added Olympic gold to her world title in the women's sprint event and France's Emily Harrop, who could have competed for Team GB, took silver.\n\n\"It's a magical day. It's history for our sport, and for us as athletes, and it's wonderful,\" said Fatton.\n\n\"It was so emotional. I was like, 'did I really do it?' It was amazing, and I was totally exhausted after the race.\"\n\nSpain's Oriol Cardona Coll took top spot in the men's sprint, the nation's first gold medal at a Winter Olympics in 54 years with their previous one won by Alpine skier Francisco Fernandez Ochoa at Sapporo in 1972.\n\nSilver in the men's event went to Russian athlete Nikita Filippov, who was competing under the neutral banner.\n\nDespite the relentless snowfall, fans poured in and lined the course to cheer on the athletes at the nearly sold-out event with much intrigue surrounding the sport's inaugural Olympic appearance.\n\nSpectators who had braved the conditions were treated to a thrilling competition as athletes pushed themselves to the limit to hike to the top of the hill then ski back down.\n\nThe first new sport added to the Winter Olympics since snowboarding in 1998, skimo is rooted in the 19th Century, before lifts to take skiers up mountains had been invented.\n\nThe sprint events consist of both an ascent and descent, with athletes sprinting uphill with skins on their skis to provide traction, navigating a diamond-shaped obstacle on their way up to a stairway in the mountain.\n\nThey then remove the skis, placing them in their backpack, and continue climbing on foot, before a further uphill section on skis.\n\nOnce they reach the top of the course, they remove the skins, and ski downhill to the finish line.\n\nThe average duration of a race is about three minutes.\n\nThe speed and format of the competition meant fans were quickly invested in the absorbing contest and generated a lively atmosphere.\n\nBBC commentator Matt Chilton said: \"The ski mountaineering event has been so well-received.\n\n\"Televisually, it is superb. For the [in person] fans, they can see everything from the grand stand. They don't miss a moment watching the action directly and on the big screen.\"\n\nSimilar to the summer Olympic sport of triathlon, the transitions are key to a successful race.\n\nThat is ultimately what let Harrop down as she struggled in the second transition, getting the skins caught instead of ripping them off in one clean motion.\n\nHarrop has English parents and could have represented Team GB but opted to compete for France, where she was born and bred.\n\nShe had topped both her heat and semi-final and looked on course for gold in the final but, after the second transition, was trailing behind Fatton and could not catch up on the downhill segment.\n\n\"It means a lot. When I look back to when I started the sport, it wasn't even on the (Olympic) programme,\" Harrop, who started out as an Alpine skier, said.\n\n\"I had an Olympic dream when I was an Alpine skier, and then when I stopped, it was just game over. So now to be here on this stage is mad.\n\n\"The atmosphere is good. The slope itself isn't super technical, but today they made the downhill a little bit more technical than usual, so that was fun.\"\n\nA mixed relay event will take place on Saturday, where one man and woman from each nation completes two laps of the course each with a race typically lasting 30-40 minutes.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "A powerful Valentine’s Day storm destroyed a centuries-old seaside arch in southern Italy long associated with romance, dealing a blow to local tourism and highlighting concerns about coastal erosion ...",
    "fullText": "An Italian coastal beauty spot known as “Lovers’ Arch” because of its popularity with courting couples collapsed during heavy storms on Valentine’s Day in what one local official called “a blow to the heart.”\n\nFaraglioni di Sant’Andrea, the site of an arch in the stone cliffs on the coast of Salento — the heel of Italy’s “boot’ — has drawn romantically inclined visitors for centuries, with lovers traditionally proposing marriage, stealing first kisses or celebrating unions. Those who kissed under the arch were destined for eternal love, according to local legend.\n\nBut when a powerful storm swept across southern Italy over the weekend, the arch’s fragile structure gave way, reducing it to a pile of rubble.\n\nIts collapse has dealt a “devastating blow to the image of Salento and to tourism,” Maurizio Cisternino, mayor of the town of Melendugno, near the fallen arch, told CNN. “It’s a blow to the heart.”\n\nThe arch was formed by centuries of harsh wind and high seas grinding away at the Calcarenite stone cliffs of Italy’s Puglia region, on the turquoise waters of the Adriatic Sea. The site, once a strategic lookout used to warn of pirates, became a magnet for lovers during the late 18th century.\n\nInstagram photos have drawn thousands more couples to the arch in recent years, Cisternino said. Because it’s free and open to the public, it’s impossible to know exactly how many, he added.\n\nLorenzo Barlato, a local resident, proposed to his wife on the clifftop overlooking the arch more than 40 years ago and the pair often returned for anniversaries.\n\n“I couldn’t wait to return,” he posted on Facebook after Saturday’s collapse. “Now, unfortunately, all I have left are the many beautiful photos I took of that piece of paradise.”\n\nThe area is so popular that hotels and resorts — many named for the arch — have sprung up to accommodate visitors.\n\nWarmer sea temperatures as a result of climate change are seen as a factor in driving the extreme weather that battered the arch, which had already been damaged by Cyclone Harry in January.\n\nBut concern over the landmark’s fragility goes back years.\n\nIn 2024, local authorities applied for a $4.5 million grant to fund a preservation project to combat coastal erosion, but failed to secure the money, according to Cisternino.\n\n“It’s a tragedy we knew was inevitable, we just didn’t expect it to happen so soon,” he told local media on Sunday.\n\nHe told CNN that “nature has reclaimed the arch, just as it created it,” and said that resources were needed to tackle the situation along the coast.\n\n“Nature has been transformed: what was there 30 years ago is no longer there.”\n\nThe collapse follows weeks of violent storms across southern Italy. In Sicily, a landslide recently saw houses fall into a ravine in the town of Niscemi. Widespread flooding has taken the lives of several people, including a man who died when his home collapsed near Rome last week.\n\nNow gone, the remnants of the arch will be left to wash out at sea, the municipality says. “It’s like a funeral,” Puglia tourism councillor Francesco Stella said Sunday of what was once one of the happiest places in Italy.",

    "description": "An enormous spinning hexagon in the clouds at Saturn’s north pole has fascinated observers since our first glimpse of it in the 1980s. The long-lived, symmetrical weather system – twice as wide as Earth – may have been spinning for centuries.",
    "fullText": "One of the most curious and captivating features on Saturn – an enormous spinning hexagon in the clouds at its north pole – has fascinated scientists and the public alike since our first glimpse of it in the 1980s.\n\nA trove of images and data from the Cassini probe that orbited Saturn from 2004-2017 provided some surprising answers, but not all of them, heightening the mystery even more.\n\nScientists first observed the six-sided jet stream when the two Voyager spacecraft passed by Saturn in 1980 and 1981. But their trajectories prevented the Voyagers from capturing the entire monstrous hexagon – twice as wide as Earth – in a single image from above. As they flew past, their viewing angle offered only tantalizing glimpses of its edge.\n\nMore than 20 years later, when Cassini arrived at Saturn in 2004, the planet’s northern hemisphere was in winter and the hexagon was hidden in shadow. Because Saturn’s seasons last so much longer than those on Earth, scientists had to wait a few more years to see the hexagon in visible light.\n\nSo until then, they looked at it a different way.\n\nIn 2006 (still winter in Saturn’s north), Cassini’s team studied the hexagon using the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) instrument on the spacecraft. VIMS could see the hexagon in the dark because it detects infrared wavelengths of light, basically heat generated in the warm interior of Saturn.\n\nSaturn is much farther from the Sun than Earth is, so its year – the time Saturn takes to complete one solar orbit – is about 29 Earth years. Consequently, each Saturnian season lasts more than seven Earth years.\n\nWhen Saturn approached its August 2009 equinox, spring – and sunlight – had arrived in the north and the wait was finally over. Cassini examined the hexagon with its main visible-light cameras, the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS). The ISS instrument had higher resolution than the VIMS instrument, and captured images in unprecedented detail.\n\nThose shots revealed a stunningly symmetric jet stream about 20,000 miles (30,000 kilometers) across, with winds about 300 mph (500 kph). In addition, the hexagon spins around a tight vortex that marks Saturn’s north pole.\n\nThe hurricane-like vortex has an eye about 50 times larger than a typical Earth hurricane, and a maximum wind speed about double that of the strongest cyclones here.\n\n“This is the belly button of Saturn,” said VIMS scientist Kevin Baines, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Baines emphasized that, although it resembles a hurricane, Saturn’s north polar vortex is not the same thing because hurricanes on Earth feed on water and heat from Earth’s surface. “But it does have at least the structure of a hurricane, what we call the classic vortex.”\n\nThe hexagon itself, however, perplexed scientists. Baines called it “one of the biggest mysteries of the dynamics of Saturn.”\n\nThe hexagon has a diameter more than twice the width of Earth. Its  sides and angles are roughly symmetrical. For humans accustomed to weather on Earth, such an ordered, geometric pattern might seem curious, or even alien. Then again, maybe Earth is the oddball.\n\nOn Earth, jet streams slither and meander with no pattern or symmetry. Weather systems swirl and twirl throughout the globe. But while the atmospheres of both Saturn and Earth follow the same natural laws, different conditions produce different results.\n\nSunlight drives wind and weather patterns on Earth, and our planet is nearly 10 times closer to the Sun than Saturn is, which means we receive nearly 100 times more sunlight than Saturn. As the Earth spins, the energy it gets from the Sun varies more sharply from day to night than it does on Saturn. Earth’s surface is also non-uniform. We have water, land, ice, and snow, which heat and cool at different rates.\n\nEarth also has an extremely shallow atmosphere compared to Saturn’s, but with towering mountains reaching miles into the sky and disturbing atmospheric flow – the same way large stones in a shallow creek make the water churn and roll.\n\nIn short, Earth lacks the conditions for a jet stream to settle into a symmetric shape. But Saturn is a different story. The gas giant has no solid surface, and its composition is far more uniform.\n\nThere’s apparently nothing in Saturn’s atmosphere to keep a perfectly natural symmetric shape from forming. Scientists even duplicated the hexagon in a laboratory on Earth using a cylindrical tank of water on top of a slowly rotating table. They produced other shapes, too.\n\n“We can also get squares, octagons and other polygons – it depends on the speed and the different properties of the fluid,” Baines said.\n\nThat’s not to say scientists have Saturn’s hexagon all figured out. For some reason, Saturn has a hexagonal jet stream only in the north, not in the south. And while scientists have reproduced the hexagon in the lab, they don’t know why it’s so long-lived.\n\n“The hexagon is just a current of air, and weather features out there that share similarities to this are notoriously turbulent and unstable,” said Andrew Ingersoll, a Cassini imaging scientist from the California Institute of Technology. “A hurricane on Earth typically lasts a week, but this has been here for decades and, who knows, maybe centuries.”\n\nIn late 2012, Cassini began making swings over Saturn's poles, giving it the best views yet of the hexagon. The color-filter movie of the hexagon shown above was assembled from eight images Cassini captured over 10 hours on Dec.10, 2012.\n\n“The polar vortex at the hexagon's center – which was discovered by Cassini – is a bit of an enigma,” Baines said.\nThese highest-resolution views accentuated a wide variety of cloud structures within the hexagon. There’s the massive “hurricane” tightly centered on the north pole, and also numerous small vortices, appearing as reddish ovals. Some of those spin clockwise while the hexagon and hurricane spin counterclockwise. Some of those smaller features are swept along with the jet stream of the hexagon, as if on a racetrack. The biggest of these vortices, seen near the lower right corner of the hexagon and appearing whitish, spans about 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers), or about twice the size of the largest hurricane ever on Earth.\n\nAs Saturn’s year progressed, moving from spring toward the summer, the north pole heated up and Cassini showed the hexagon changing color. A bluish-green in 2013 turned to a yellowish haze by the planet’s summer solstice, on May 24, 2017. Solar radiation from the increasing sunlight was breaking apart methane molecules in the atmosphere, which then rearranged into hydrocarbon particles – akin to the formation of smog on Earth – and formed the yellow haze. Researchers found that small haze particles fill the inside of the hexagon, while larger particles dominate outside of it, with the inside and outside being separated by the jet stream that delineates the hexagon.\n\nAfter 20 years in space and 294 orbits around Saturn, Cassini exhausted its fuel supply. To avoid contaminating moons of Saturn that could have conditions suitable for life, Cassini’s mission team sent the probe on a daring final operation that would seal its fate. After a series of nearly two dozen nail-biting dives between the planet and the icy minefield of its rings, Cassini burned up in Saturn’s atmosphere on Sept. 15, 2017, returning science data to the very end.\n\nBefore Cassini’s Grand Finale, Baines was eager to see what further insights could come from the probe’s close-up views. “These last 22 orbits are giving us a unique chance to observe and analyze the hexagon in unprecedented detail,” he said.\n\nAnd researchers have continued poring over that data, long after Cassini’s end.\n\nGravity measurements made in Cassini's final orbits showed that the high winds at Saturn's cloud tops – up to 895 mph (1,440 kph) – persist far below, extending 5,000 miles (8,000 kilometers) toward the planet’s interior. Harvard researchers in 2020 used those findings to suggest that a deep supersonic jet stream is pinched on all sides by smaller cyclones and pushed upward, forming the hexagon.\n\nCassini project scientist Linda Spilker, of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said after the Grand Finale that she’s looking forward \"to seeing other new discoveries that remain to be found in the Cassini data.”\n\n“Even after Cassini’s 13 years in orbit around Saturn,” she said, “the mystery and extent of the hexagon continue to grow.”",

    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO (FOX 5/KUSI) — With heavy rain expected to move into the region beginning Monday and lasting through Thursday, the City of San Diego announced crews are ramping up preparations to reduce the risk of flooding across the city.\n\nCity officials say storm teams will be monitoring river levels, storm channels and more than 46,000 storm drains during the rainy stretch. Crews have been cleaning drains and inlets known for debris buildup, as well as sweeping streets to prevent trash and pollutants from washing into local waterways.\n\nLow-lying areas such as Mission Valley, Sorrento Valley and Southcrest — identified by FEMA as Special Flood Hazard Areas — are especially vulnerable during extended rain events. City officials say roads in flood-prone areas may be closed if needed and drivers are urged to avoid those areas during heavy rainfall.\n\nAuthorities investigate fatal three-vehicle crash in East County\n\nThe city’s Stormwater Department has also cleared tons of debris and vegetation from storm channels in recent months, including ongoing maintenance along Chollas Creek. Officials say staff will continue monitoring those areas throughout the storm and conduct additional maintenance once the weather clears\n\n“Preparing for potential flooding is part of the city’s responsibility year-round,” said Stormwater Department Director Todd Snyder. “Our crews are working to make sure our stormwater systems are ready and we encourage residents to take a few simple steps now to prepare for the rain.”\n\nCity leaders are asking San Diegans to take several simple steps to help reduce flooding near their homes, including:\n\nSweep and remove trash, leaves and debris around storm drains and gutters.\n\nSecurely close trash and recycling bin lids and place bins 2 to 3 feet away from the curb to avoid blocking stormwater flow.\n\nTurn off irrigation systems to conserve water and minimize runoff.\n\nNever open or lift manhole covers during street flooding.\n\nEmergency responders also remind residents to know the safest routes to and from their homes in case flooding occurs, and to never drive, ride or walk through floodwaters.\n\nSandbags are available in limited quantities at 11 recreation centers across the city, with a limit of 10 bags per household or business.

It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm a 19-year-old freshman at Stanford University. I wasn't sure what to expect on campus — whether people would be actively dating or not. I have friends on both sides of the spectrum; some are more focused on school and friendships, and some are in relationships.\n\nBut I initially found Date Drop through my friends.\n\nIt was one of those week one things — everyone was getting to know each other, and we all decided it could be fun if we signed up together.\n\nI've never been on a dating app like Hinge or Tinder, but I was surprised by the complexity of the questions that Date Drop asked. The questions on Date Drop were like: \"What do you do for fun,\" \"What are you doing academically,\" \"Do you have any age, height, or ethnicity preferences,\" and so on.\n\nIt also asked whether you preferred long-term or short-term relationships, and how many kids you wanted. It was very comprehensive. There was even an open-ended question asking me to describe my perfect date.\n\nAnyone on campus can sign up — from freshmen to seniors to grad students. We have another similar platform on campus called Marriage Pact that matches once a year, but Date Drop matches weekly.\n\nAlso, if you want to get to know someone, you can enter their info, or if you want to try to match two people, you can influence the algorithm. For example, you can play matchmaker and enter the info for two people across the hall from each other that you want matched. It never tells you who has put you into Date Drop; it'll say that someone has \"shipped\" you with someone else.\n\nThe first time, I was matched with a friend of mine, which was fun. We treated it as a friend date and went out to get coffee at a coffee shop that was giving out free drinks to Date Drop dates.\n\nI was matched a second time, but that person didn't reach out, so it went nowhere.\n\nAfter that, I had other stuff going on, like midterms that I needed to focus on, and Date Drop had kind of lost its novelty. Most of my friends had a similar experience.\n\nStanford is smaller, so I think it's easier to get to know people than it is at a state school. There's more of a community, and the chances of you knowing a friend who knows your Date Drop or a friend of a friend are high. A lot of people have similar interests, which makes it easier to strike up a conversation than it might be at a bigger school.\n\nOur generation has grown up on online platforms and sees them as a way to connect with others. It's definitely a culture shift. I also think it's not bad to try something new. You never know what's going to happen, and I think a lot of us go into it with that mentality.\n\nWhile I didn't find a match, I'd be open to doing it again in the future. I do know a couple of Date Drop couples. I'd do it again if it were something my sophomore year dorm wanted to do together, as a way to get out there and meet people.",

    "description": "If the Soviets hadn't been atheists, it would've been a Come-to-Jesus moment.",
    "fullText": "When Operation Desert Storm ended in 1991, it blew the Soviet Union’s collective mind—and Moscow’s hangover has never ended.\n\nThe hardest pill the Soviet general staff would have to swallow was that Iraq was fighting with Soviet doctrine: Soviet gear, Soviet training, and a Soviet-style air defense concept. The Russians expected Baghdad to be a stress test for American air power and a preview of how a U.S. coalition (like NATO) might bleed in a big, messy land war.\n\nAlso Read: 21 Facts about the First Gulf War\n\nInstead, the Coalition ran an air campaign that looked like large-scale surgery, then wrapped the ground war up in about 100 hours. To Soviet eyes, it wasn’t just that their client got beaten. It felt like their whole model of modern war got exposed as outdated for the entire world to see.\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition didn’t just beat Saddam Hussein’s army. It made a public demonstration of how wars would be fought after the Cold War. And the Soviet general staff, already dealing with a collapsing economy and a political system eating itself alive, had to sit there and take notes. \n\nThose notes were not comforting.\n\nOn paper, Iraq appeared to be a formidable opponent. It had a large army (the fourth-largest in the world), extensive armor, robust air defenses, and years of experience fighting Iran. Much of its gear and training had Soviet fingerprints all over it. Viewers from Moscow could reasonably believe this would turn into a long, bloody grind once the ground war started. \n\nTo the Soviets, the war to oust Iraq from Kuwait could’ve taken weeks. Maybe months\n\nIn Moscow’s prewar mental script, air power could hurt you, slow you down, and make life miserable, but it couldn’t decide the war by itself. The decisive fight would still be the ground campaign, and that ground campaign (the Russians believed) would punish an all-volunteer American force.\n\nThat belief was doctrine, rooted in how the Red Army was designed to fight NATO. The model was a system of armor and infantry massed and protected by air defenses, backed by artillery, with enough depth to absorb punishment and keep moving. \n\nSo when early reports suggested Iraqi formations were unraveling fast, it was easy to dismiss them as confusion, exaggeration, or wishful thinking. Fog of war happens. Propaganda happens. And in a fast-moving conflict, both sides always claim the other one is panicking.\n\nMoscow’s theory didn’t survive first contact with reality. The ground war began on Feb. 24, 1991, and it was essentially over by the 28th. The famous 100 hours number wasn’t just a headline.\n\nSoviet observers watched Iraqi air defenses get blinded and dismantled in layers. They watched command posts go quiet. They watched armored formations get shredded, sometimes without ever seeing what hit them. And they watched a massive Coalition force move fast through open desert, at night, in bad weather, then show up on Iraq’s flank as if it had teleported.\n\nThe Coalition’s main ground move should’ve looked familiar to Soviet planners on a map. It was a huge left hook through the desert, a deep envelopment that punished an opponent who expected the main blow to land elsewhere. In theory, that kind of maneuver was respectable. In practice, it happened with a tempo and coordination that Iraq didn’t match.\n\nU.S. forces pushed wide, moved quickly, and kept units aligned across featureless terrain in bad visibility, often operating at night and in poor weather. Iraqi forces didn’t respond like a machine built to fight a mobile, combined-arms campaign. They reacted late, inconsistently, or not at all, and by the time they realized where the main threat actually was, the Coalition was already on their flank and behind key positions.\n\nFor Soviet observers, the bigger shock wasn’t that a left hook happened. It was that it worked so cleanly, so quickly, and alongside an air campaign that had already shredded the opponent’s ability to see, communicate, and coordinate.\n\nIn the air, Iraqi pilots and air defenders faced a problem that goes beyond courage or competence. When you’re dealing with electronic attack, radar suppression, stealthy aircraft, decoys, and constant pressure, the tactical experience can feel like everything is lying to you. Contacts appear and vanish. Radars behave strangely. Warning receivers chirp, then go quiet, then scream again. \n\nSoviet doctrine was comfortable with a certain kind of war. It assumed time, mass, and a hierarchy that could grind its way through chaos. What Desert Storm showcased was a style of fighting that tried to prevent the opponent from ever getting organized enough to grind back.\n\nFor a staff raised on artillery math and tank counts, this suddenly became an was an existential crisis.\n\nIf the first day broke Moscow’s theory, the images from the days that followed broke its spirit. The Soviet Union learned that the Cold War wasn’t a stalemate. \n\nAs Iraqi troops and vehicles fled Kuwait City north on Highway 80, American air power hit the retreating column for hours with industrial precision. When satellite images filtered back to Moscow, Soviet analysts saw what looked less like a battle scene and more like a mass grave. A massive number of vehicles were jammed and incinerated, tanks with turrets blown off, trucks seemingly melted into the road.\n\nWestern media called it the “Highway of Death.” In Moscow, it was something else altogether, a demonstration of what happens when one side can find, track, and hit what it wants, while the other side can’t do anything about it. \n\nIraq’s loss wasn’t only about tanks burning. It was about the Coalition’s ability to make the battlefield transparent enough to turn a large movement of units into a vulnerability. Once you can consistently detect movement, share targeting information quickly, and strike with precision, the old comfort of massing a large force of armor starts to look less like deterrence and more like a liability.\n\nInitially, Moscow’s copium was to blame the Iraqis. Iraq must have been incompetent. Iraqi troops were undisciplined. They misused Soviet doctrine. They didn’t fight the way they were supposed to fight. It’s not entirely wrong. Iraq had major problems in training, leadership, morale, logistics, and initiative. But it also misses what Desert Storm put on display, the thing the USSR didn’t want ot accept: This wasn’t just a mismatch of soldiers. \n\nIt was a mismatch of systems.\n\nSoviet analysts started digging. They looked for a single decisive advantage: one ghost, one superweapon, one electronic trick that blinded radar, one wonder weapon that explained the whole thing. But if there was one thing that made the swift destruction of the Iraqi Army possible, it was one thing that was actually many things. Iraq was actually fighting a network.\n\nVictory in the Gulf began with something that might have sounded like science fiction in 1991, but is used today to deliver food: the Global Positioning System. GPS wasn’t just navigation. It was the quiet enabler that let U.S. forces maneuver at speed, at night, in sandstorms, and hit with accuracy that made older platforms perform like something new.\n\nThe real gut punch was identifying America’s “all-seeing eye,” the E-8 JSTARS, a radar and battle management platform that could scan enormous swaths of ground and track moving vehicles, then push that data across the force. The Americans fused sensors, shooters, and communications into a single integrated system. JSTARS sees movement, passes targets digitally, AWACS sorts the air picture, and shooters arrive already knowing where to look. \n\nThat’s why the “Highway of Death” looked like a conveyor belt of destruction.\n\nIt’s also why this hit Moscow so hard. Soviet doctrine was hierarchical. Reports went up, orders came down, and time lag was baked in. The Americans, in this view, were operating a network in which platforms were tools and speed was the real weapon.\n\nA RAND assessment published in 1992 laid out how Russian military thinkers were digesting Desert Storm, and the lessons weren’t subtle. First and foremost, they saw Desert Storm as proof that modern war had changed dramatically from the model they’d expected. It didn’t change bits and pieces, the Gulf War changed the foundation of Soviet military thinking.\n\nAlthough the air war came first, the USSR saw air power as the main event, not the opening act. The idea that air forces could create victory conditions with comparatively low friendly losses hit hard, especially for a military culture raised on mass and attrition. The Soviets also had to confront an ugly truth about tanks and armies under hostile skies. If the other side controls the air, armored forces become endangered. It’s a simple matter of exposure.\n\nSoviet-style command-and-control also appeared too rigid for the American tempo. Centralized control might keep order, but it also slows adaptation. Desert Storm highlighted speed, flexibility, and coordination across services as more than buzzwords. Fixed defenses weren’t the comfort blanket they used to be. Hardened shelters, static nodes, and predictable infrastructure became targets. Stealth and precision made hiding harder.\n\nAnd then there was coalition warfare. \n\nSoviet analysts didn’t just notice the Coalition existed. They noticed how it functioned. They saw victory tied not only to weapon performance, but also to a command system that could coordinate air, land, maritime forces, national goals, and political will without collapsing into chaos.\n\nMoreover, victory on the battlefield would henceforth be determined by who sees first, who shares fastest, who decides quickest, and who can keep operating when their networks get attacked.\n\nThat conclusion carried an uncomfortable second layer. Iraq wasn’t just a client state getting embarrassed. The Soviet Union, and later Russia, used similar hardware as the Iraqis did in Kuwait, and had some similar habits of command. So the nightmare wasn’t Iraqi conscripts losing tanks. It was Soviet conscripts losing them the same way in a war against NATO.\n\nDesert Storm didn’t just end a war in the desert. It helped start the argument over what modern war even is, and Moscow has been arguing with that reality ever since.\n\n• The Coalition destroyed the entire Iraqi Navy in four days\n• How the Marines ripped through the Iraqis in Operation Desert Storm\n• Navy battleships pulled off the biggest military deception of Desert Storm",

    "fullText": "Last night brought a test of epic proportions for Northwestern, as it was tasked with taking down No. 1 Texas Tech in its first game of its long weekend in Clearwater, Fla.\n\nThe start seemed promising for NU, but reality struck early, and the hope for an upset slowly faded as the ‘Cats posted zero after zero in the bottom half of each inning.\n\nThat reality check was the nation’s best returning arm in NiJaree Canady, who pitched five innings of relief for the win, only giving up two hits while striking out eight.\n\nAs for the Red Raiders, it took them an inning to figure out Northwestern starter Emma Blea, crossing the plate twice in the second and never looking back. The two that crossed the plate were the only two earned runs for NU pitchers.\n\nIt was smooth sailing for Blea in the top of the first, as she retired .500 hitter Mihyia Davis on a lineout to center before painting the outside corner to log a backwards K at the expense of Mia Williams.\n\nFirst strikeout of the day for Emma Blea, and we are off at the @ClearwaterInv! 🔥\n\nT1 | NU 0, Texas Tech 0 pic.twitter.com/tEduUMGjTj\n\n— Northwestern Softball (@NUSBcats) February 12, 2026\n\nTaylor Pannell reached on an infield single on the very next pitch before Blea retired the side, doing her own dirty work by scooping up a Jackie Lis grounder.\n\nNorthwestern’s first at-bat was nearly a copy-paste of Texas Tech’s: a K, a popout, a single and a flyout all in succession.\n\nA leadoff walk surrendered to Alana Johnson came back to sting Blea and the ‘Cats later in the second. Lauren Allred laced a one-out double into the right-center gap, scoring Johnson to break the ice. Lagi Quiroga followed with one of her own, this one to the opposite gap, as the Red Raiders swiftly snatched an early 2-0 lead.\n\nNU seemed to kickstart some momentum of its own after Blea got back into her groove to end the inning. Kansas Robinson found herself on base after an error from Red Raiders’ starter Samantha Lincoln. Tru Medina then stood in the box to get plunked by a pitch, and after a Bridget Donahey flyout and an Izzy Cunnea sac fly, Kate Renschen drew a walk to load the bases.\n\nTexas Tech head coach Gerry Glasco then emerged from the dugout to bring out Canady, who cleaned up the mess in two pitches to halt the second-inning rally.\n\nBlea continued to settle back down and sent the ’Cats back to the dish after a 1-2-3 inning in the third, highlighted by a smooth play from Medina.\n\nWe see you, Tru Medina! 👀👏\n\nThe rookie making plays in the hot corner!#SCTop10 pic.twitter.com/GOVeIwi886\n\n— Northwestern Softball (@NUSBcats) February 12, 2026\n\nThe heart of the Northwestern order seemed to have Canady scouted, but luck wasn’t on its side in the frame. Kelsey Nader grounded out after a nine-pitch at-bat, Kaylie Avvisato ripped a line drive only to have it gloved by Pannell and Robinson went down on strikes after working a full count.\n\nBad omens continued to haunt Northwestern as it took the field for the fourth. An error by Donahey at short gave way to another double by Allred, setting up two runners in scoring position for Texas Tech. Quiroga’s sac fly did the job to drive in the run, padding the lead once more.\n\nThe ‘Cats seemed to have spiraled themselves out of the contest, as Canady shoved in the next half-frame, striking out Medina and Dohaney before getting a measly pop-up out of Cunnea to finish the fourth still unscathed.\n\nSigne Dohse’s first full inning of relief went quite smoothly, as she bounced back from an early base hit and induced soft contact to get out of the frame. Canady took note and did the same, also getting in and out of the circle after facing four batters.\n\nMedina’s throwing error to start the sixth opened the door of opportunity for Texas Tech, and it walked straight through. Allred got hit by a pitch to advance Logan Halleman, Hailey Toney laid down a bunt to move both runners and Davis came through to bring them both home on Texas Tech’s fourth two-bagger of the night.\n\nThat would be all for the Red Raiders’ scoring, but that was all Canady needed. She sat down five of the next six batters she faced before Chloe Riassetto’s number was called for the final out and the save.\n\nQuite the jarring welcome from the Panhandle for the ‘Cats to process, but there’s no rest for the weary. After Northwestern’s loss to UCF on Friday morning, NU rounds out the trip with contests against Missouri, No. 17 Georgia and No. 8 Texas A&M.",

    "fullText": "Forecasts are warning about a series of upcoming winter storms that are predicted to bring extremely powerful weather conditions to a region of the United States. The area is expected to face hurricane-force winds and heavy snow accumulation that will build up over several days.\n\nOn February 12, 2026, Newsweek reported that a series of winter storms could \"dump up to 10 feet of snow\" in the high-elevation terrain in the Sierra Nevada. Models show the potential for a total of 120 inches (10 feet) falling in that area of California and Nevada over a period of one or two weeks starting on Monday, February 16. Amounts will vary significantly by location and elevation, with lower but still highly significant figures more likely in some areas.\n\nThere aren't any major cities in the direct path of this series of storms. However, several populated ski towns are expected to see extreme levels of snowfall over the span of the systems.\n\nSki Towns in the Sierra Nevada Likely to See Heavy Snow:\n\nMount Rose – Ski Tahoe (near Reno, NV)\n\nDiamond Peak (Incline Village, NV)\n\nThose towns are home to thousands of residents combined, and they draw a great deal of tourism. For example, the website for Mammoth Lakes, California, states that it receives 2.8 million tourists annually, 1.3 million of which arrive in the winter season. Once these weather conditions pass, there will be lots of snow in these towns, which will be perfect for tourists. Men's Journal's gear editor, Adam Bible, put together a guide of the best ski and snowboard gear that has valuable information for anyone who wants to hit the slopes in California or anywhere else.\n\nA February 11, 2026, San Francisco Chronicle article detailed forecasts that call for extremely powerful wind gusts in the Sierra Nevada. Starting on Monday, February 16, and lasting until the following day, the region of California will be struck by 65 - 80 mph wind gusts.\n\nOn the National Weather Service's website for the National Hurricane Center, it describes how destructive wind gusts that reach up to 80 mph can be. That article shows that those gusts are deemed to be category 1 hurricane-force winds and it provides a breakdown of the effects they can have.\n\n\"Very dangerous winds will produce some damage: Well-constructed frame homes could have damage to their roof, shingles, vinyl siding, and gutters. Large branches of trees will snap, and shallowly rooted trees may be toppled. Extensive damage to power lines and poles likely will result in power outages that could last a few to several days.”",

    "description": "Diablo 2 fans are finally receiving new content for Diablo franchise's 30th anniversary, as Blizzard has revealed a new DLC for Diablo 2: Resurrected that will add a new class alongside some of the community's most-requested features, albeit for a price.\nStarting today, players will be able to purchase the Reign of the Warlock DLC for $25. While the new Warlock class, which uses summoned demons both to fight and to sacrifice in order to gain buffs, is the most notable inclusion, the community is likely to be just as excited about some of the other additions coming as part of the Reign of the Warlock: a loot filter and enhanced stash tabs.",

    "description": "Thomas Frank's appointment by Tottenham was a gamble that ended in a storm of toxicity, writes Phil McNulty.",
    "fullText": "Thomas Frank's appointment as Tottenham head coach was a gamble by both parties. It was a gamble that failed - ending in a storm of toxicity.\n\nFrank left behind the stability and structure that underpinned his superb work at Brentford for the chaos of Spurs.\n\nIn place of the bedrock of Brentford owner Matthew Benham and director of football Phil Giles, Frank stepped into a high-stakes environment where even winning the Europa League - Spurs' first trophy in 17 years - did not spare predecessor Ange Postecoglou the sack.\n\nSpurs, in turn, were employing a head coach who had operated away from the sort of harsh spotlight and high expectations that awaited him in his new job. It was an ill-starred alliance, and Frank quickly found himself out of his depth.\n\nThis has been a joyless, miserable spell characterised by constant hostility aimed in Frank's direction by the vast majority of Spurs supporters, who decided very quickly he was not the man for them or the job he was required to do.\n\nFrank's dismissal will be a bitter disappointment for the popular, personable Dane, who earned his big opportunity at Spurs by taking Brentford into the Premier League and keeping them there for four seasons.\n\nFrank sacked by Spurs after eight months in charge\n\nReaction after Frank sacked as Tottenham boss\n\nFrank took over a side that finished 17th in the Premier League last season, having lost 22 games in the process.\n\nThey won the Europa League, but the true measure of a side is league position - and by that metric, Frank inherited a mediocre squad.\n\nThe notion this could be fully corrected - or even significantly transformed - in a matter of months is from the realms of fantasy.\n\nSpurs not only needed a change in team, but a change in culture. This must be factored into Frank's downfall.\n\nThe club has struggled to find anyone to match the popularity of Mauricio Pochettino, who was sacked six months after Spurs' defeat by Liverpool in the 2019 Champions League final.\n\nFrank's dismissal means he joins a list that includes proven winners Jose Mourinho and Antonio Conte, along with Nuno Espirito Santo and Postecoglou, who brought back long-awaited silverware last season.\n\nThe Dane ultimately could not get to grips with this most testing of tasks. It consumed him, ending with him looking a broken, beleaguered figure.\n\nFrank failed to produce a side with any sort of clear identity, dragged down by muddled thinking and, when it mattered, a safety-first approach.\n\nWhen the history of Frank's time at Spurs is written, defeats at home by Chelsea and at Arsenal in the north London derby will assume something close to notoriety.\n\nIn statistical terms, they were two of the most impotent attacking displays by any Premier League team this season. Spurs generated 0.1 xG at home in their 1-0 loss to Chelsea, then just 0.07 xG in the 4-1 reverse at Arsenal.\n\nIt was Frank's timid approach - almost as much as the loss - that drew such fierce criticism after the game at Arsenal - a five-man defence effectively a damage-limitation exercise that allowed the Gunners to win with ease.\n\nThe fact Eberechi Eze - a player Spurs wanted but allowed Arsenal to steal in and beat them to a £60m deal - scored a magnificent hat-trick only added to the pain and embarrassment.\n\nWhile the defeat at Arsenal will have hurt Spurs fans more, it was the loss to Chelsea that was arguably more worrying, especially as it was at home.\n\nOnly a combination of wastefulness from the visitors and the heroics of goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario prevented it from being a hammering.\n\nIt was the beginning of a painful journey to the end.\n\nWhen Frank was at Brentford, he had a reputation for clarity of thought, strategy and communication - a personality who could detect problems and solve them.\n\nThose qualities were lost as Spurs hit the buffers after winning his first two Premier League games in charge.\n\nEither Frank was not clear enough or the Spurs players did not buy into his approach.\n\nIf regular observers were asked to identify any obvious style or strategy, they would struggle to answer. This was a mishmash of ideas with no clear identification marks.\n\nFrank started with two wins: at home against Burnley, then at Manchester City. But, as with Postecoglou, a bright start soon subsided.\n\nAt Brentford, Frank's plan was to play long, play quick, and pressurise opponents in open play and set-pieces. There was quality too, with forwards such as Ivan Toney, Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa.\n\nFrank never established any obvious identity at Spurs, with fans quickly turning against what they saw as at best a pragmatic approach, and at worst a negative one.\n\nFans, and on many occasions players, either failed to understand Frank's strategy or believe in it, with the head coach himself sometimes looking shocked at the manner of Spurs' unravelling.\n\nOne of Frank's first acts was to name Cristian Romero as captain in succession to Son Heung-Min. It was an ill-judged decision to hand the armband to the Argentine World Cup winner. Too often he has been a liability on the field - at times a red card waiting to happen - and off the pitch with loose-lipped statements.\n\nThe former was proven in red cards against Liverpool and at Manchester United, the latter in two outbursts against the club's hierarchy - the first effectively accusing them of lying in a later edited Instagram post then, saying the lack of available players was \"disgraceful\".\n\nIt did Frank more harm than good.\n\nFor all the failings on the pitch, Frank did not enjoy the best of fortunes when it came to players available to him.\n\nInjuries denied him the chance to use some of his most influential performers. And there also was the departure of the iconic Son.\n\nAnother major blow came when the club let the potential signing of Eze drag on so long that Arsenal seized the opportunity to hijack his move from Crystal Palace.\n\nSpurs also thought they had a £60m deal to sign Nottingham Forest's gifted midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White, with a medical tentatively pencilled in. But Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis begged to differ, and the saga ended with the player signing a new deal.\n\nIn Eze and Gibbs-White, Spurs could have acquired match-winners who might have proved priceless to Frank.\n\nDejan Kulusevski - one of Spurs' most dangerous game-changers - never played a minute under Frank because of surgery on a patella injury sustained last season.\n\nEngland midfielder James Maddison had been in and out under Postecoglou, but his hopes of making an impact under Frank disappeared when he tore his anterior cruciate ligament in a pre-season friendly against Newcastle in June.\n\nDominic Solanke - the side's £60m spearhead - was also missing for months after an operation on an ankle injury, while Mohammed Kudus - a £55m signing from West Ham - and Richarlison also suffered long-term injuries.\n\nWhile Frank was unable to find solutions, there is no question those absences were damaging.\n\nFormer chairman Daniel Levy was a permanent lightning rod for the anger of Spurs fans. When he departed in September, it was welcomed by the majority but left Frank \n\nFrank was - justifiably - a hugely popular figure at Brentford, not just for his success on the field but the close connection he forged with supporters.\n\nThe sight of him leading his players on a post-game lap of honour became familiar - and he would acknowledge faces he recognised in the crowd.\n\nIt was ironic, then, that one of the most toxic moments of Frank's brief reign came at the Gtech on New Year's Day, when he was greeted with loud jeers from the visiting Spurs fans at the end of a mind-numbing goalless draw.\n\nIt was not so easy to forge close bonds in a vast, state-of-the-art arena housing more than 61,000 supporters. They have to be forged by results - results which did not come, winning just two of 13 home league games.\n\nFrank's post-match lap of honour became a point of contention and controversy when defenders Djed Spence and Micky van de Ven brushed past him and refused to take part after the defeat at home by Chelsea, though they later apologised.\n\nEven if they were angry with fans, the manner in which they brusquely dismissed Frank's wishes sent out poor signals, raising doubts about his level of control.\n\nFor all Spence's contrition, the manager again faced awkward questions about his defender's reaction to being substituted during the dismal 3-0 loss at Nottingham Forest.\n\nIt has been a miserable, joyless reign. Too often games ended in discontent - a disconnect noted by the club.\n\nFrank certainly never felt the need to publicly criticise his own supporters at Brentford - a move that rarely ends well - but after a defeat by Fulham he declared the booing of goalkeeper Vicario \"unacceptable\" and not the actions of \"true Spurs supporters\".\n\nTo do so - even to only a section of the crowd - was a high-risk strategy. He never got the wins to heal that fracture.\n\nFrank's reign also proved to be unwittingly accident prone, as when he was caught on camera unwittingly drinking out of an Arsenal cup before the defeat at Bournemouth in January.\n\nA small matter not of Frank's doing, but led to him being lampooned by Gunners' fans, with memes depicting the Spurs boss relaxing in Arsenal pyjamas while sitting on a red-and-white club duvet.\n\nFrank's honesty, upbeat demeanour and results meant he was idolised at Brentford. It was the polar opposite at Spurs.\n\nTime and patience - precious commodities at Brentford - were in short supply. Not just from the post-Levy powerbrokers, but from fans who simply never warmed to Frank, and who were unconvinced by his pedigree and methods.\n\nThere was no doubt many Spurs supporters felt Frank was not up to the job from the start - his solid grounding at a smaller club in Brentford not, in their eyes, the background required to wrestle with the unwieldy beast in north London.\n\nFrank needed to make an instant impact to dispel the doubts. He was unable to do so.\n\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Tottenham - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Livingston Mall, now a veritable ghost town, was once a big player in North Jersey retail. But a maelstrom of events sucked the life out of it.",
    "fullText": "Google the phrase “dead malls in New Jersey” and you’ll be hit with a few contenders — but a standout in North Jersey is Livingston Mall.\n\nWith the Macy’s anchor store closing sometime in 2026, and Barnes & Noble expected to leave sometime in 2027, Livingston Mall is on its last breaths.\n\nIt opened on Eisenhower Parkway in western Essex County in 1972 as downtowns and urban centers became hollowed out and the dominant spenders moved to the suburbs.\n\nMalls are not necessarily dead — data from ICSC, a worldwide commercial real estate trade association, showed that during this past holiday season, 72% of shoppers bought something at a suburban shopping center or mall.\n\nBut analysts interviewed by NorthJersey.com all agreed that Livingston Mall is a \"dead mall.\"\n\nIn its heyday, the two-story center had three major department stores and 108 small specialty stores, historical documents show. They included Lord & Taylor, Sears, KB Toys, Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works.\n\nLivingston — with Route 280 running through it — “was readily accessible to both Newark and New York by a major transportation artery,” Charles DeMarco Jr., a local historian, has written. The completion of Eisenhower Parkway between Route 10 and Roseland only bolstered customer traffic.\n\nWith cities and suburban downtowns struggling at the time, and online shopping still decades away, suburban malls were the dominant centers of culture and commerce.\n\n“People would spend their Saturday afternoons and Sunday afternoons strolling the mall, looking at new goods, figuring out what’s fashionable and the like,” said James Hughes, a professor of urban planning and policy development at Rutgers University in New Brunswick.\n\nBut everything that could go wrong for a mall managed to hit Livingston Mall.\n\nBig-box stores such as Target and Walmart rose, siphoning away dollars.\n\nAnd Livingston Mall faced intense competition from just 4 miles away in The Mall at Short Hills, a luxury shopping center that had opened in its enclosed format in 1980.\n\nThen online shopping rolled out in force around 2007 and 2008, Hughes said.\n\nUrban centers like Newark and Jersey City, as well as downtowns like Ridgewood and Westfield, rebounded in the past decade and drew back dollars that had gone to malls, Hughes said.\n\nBut then the COVID-19 pandemic decimated customer traffic.\n\nLuis Castillo, a general manager at the mall's Popeyes restaurant, started working at Livingston Mall in 2017. Cinnabon shuttered within the next couple of years, but its closure hardly seemed ominous to the other tenants.\n\nThe shopping center remained bustling until the COVID pandemic hit the area and a state-mandated lockdown forced store owners to close up shop temporarily, Castillo said. At least they thought it would be temporary.\n\nWhen the mall reopened, many of the business owners couldn’t afford to return. They had spent what little money they had left to cover back rent through the six-month closure at the landlord’s insistence, Castillo said.\n\nOne store after another shuttered.\n\n“We never thought it would go down so fast,” Castillo said. It didn’t take long for much of the central corridor to become vacant. The only available light came through the mall’s atrium. The place was dark, literally and figuratively.\n\n“Sort of the perfect storm hit,” Hughes said of Livingston Mall.\n\nSears closed in April 2020 and Lord & Taylor in August that year. Developers of the nearby Livingston Shopping Center announced this January that the Barnes & Noble store would be moving out of Livingston Mall property and going less than 2 miles down the road to the shopping center.\n\nMost recently, Macy’s announced in early January that it would close its location at Livingston Mall later in the year.\n\nLivingston Mall had been owned by Simon Property Group, one of the largest mall owners in the U.S. In November 2025 it acquired the remaining stake of Taubman Realty Group, which operates luxury malls across the U.S., including The Mall at Short Hills. That acquisition process by Simon Property Group started in 2020.\n\n“From that point forward, it was clear that Simon was no longer committed to the success of the Livingston Mall, and the neglect of the property was immediate,” Livingston Township Manager Barry Lewis told NorthJersey.com in an email.\n\nKohan Retail Investment Group — which bought the mall in 2022 — “has a very poor track record in owning and managing malls, even being referred to in one article as a ‘mall scavenger,’” Lewis continued.\n\n“As soon as Kohan bought the property, the decline accelerated and the conditions at the Livingston Mall quickly deteriorated and have continued to do so,” Lewis said.\n\nRepresentatives for Kohan did not return multiple emails seeking comment or requesting an interview.\n\nLivingston Mall’s days as an enclosed shopping center are over, argued Charles Cristella, who studies retail and malls for Jones Lang LaSalle, a commercial real estate adviser.\n\n“You cannot bring it back as a traditional mall,” he said in an interview.\n\nLast year, the township designated Livingston Mall as an “area in need of redevelopment” and drew up potential plans for what could go at the site.\n\n“The town — if it’s a redevelopment area — is in the driver's seat,” said Hughes, of Rutgers. “They could acquire the land and totally control it.”\n\nLewis said the township could potentially acquire the land through eminent domain.\n\nThere are several competing interests at the moment, Lewis said. Kohan owns 30 acres of land, and Macy’s is looking to buy 10 acres. Hudson Bay Company — the owner of Lord & Taylor — has a 99-year lease on 10 acres. Transformco, which acquired some former Sears assets, owns 16 acres.\n\n“If private developers are unable to successfully negotiate and acquire control of the mall on reasonable terms, the township is prepared to exercise its power of eminent domain to acquire the property in partnership with one or more redevelopers,” Lewis said.\n\nWhat would go there remains up in the air. The township of Livingston has an affordable housing obligation of 376 housing units through apartments and townhouses, and the mall site has been eyed as a candidate for where the housing could be built.\n\nThere’s also the possibility of a “broad mix of uses that may include retail, dining and entertainment, experiential, recreation, public amenities, hotel, medical or other office and other possible uses,” Lewis said.\n\nFor comparison, a redevelopment project adjacent to Garden State Plaza in Paramus is underway and will include as many as 1,400 apartments, along with additional shops, a hotel, a senior care facility and a park-like “town green.”\n\n“There is no other property almost anywhere of this size in such a prime location that holds such promise,” Livingston Mayor Shawn Klein said in an email.\n\nOn a snowy Wednesday in early February, Livingston Mall loomed over an empty, decaying parking lot pocked with potholes. Some of the lot was blanketed in unplowed, pristine snow left over from a storm that passed over the region over a week earlier.\n\nThe mall's decay is apparent to the few employees who still work there.\n\nJim Testa, an optician at LensCrafters, knows a secret trick for navigating the blacktop’s treacherous terrain: “To get out of here you just kind of hug the building until you pass Macy’s. Then you steer outward. But there’s one more crater after that.”\n\nOver the past year, JCP&L — the local electric company — cut power to the building twice during business hours because the landlord hadn’t paid the mall’s utility bills, Testa said.\n\nThe food court sinks were long out of service. In the summer, there was no air conditioning.\n\nWhen rain dripped down through the ceiling, the owners of Hidden Treasures, a collectibles and antiques store, called the fire department. No one at the investment group has answered the phone in three years, said David McMorrow of Hidden Treasures.\n\nTesta calls the municipality when emergent circumstances arise. The Popeyes staff has learned to fix issues themselves.\n\nNow, amid the arctic blasts bringing in bitter cold from the north for days on end, LensCrafters employees said they have used their own space heater to keep the office habitable.\n\n\"It's uncomfortable,\" said Castillo, the general manager at Popeyes. \"All my employees wear coats.\"\n\nHis assessment was blunt: “There is no management.”\n\n(This story was updated because an earlier version included an inaccuracy.)\n\nDaniel Munoz covers business, consumer affairs, labor and the economy for NorthJersey.com and The Record.\n\nEmail: munozd@northjersey.com; Twitter:@danielmunoz100, Facebook and Instagram\n\nThis article originally appeared on NorthJersey.com: Zombie mall is dying in North Jersey, hit by 'perfect storm'",

Rather, it is mandated by disease, either in urgent-care settings or emergency rooms. Medical care is paid for not only by consumers, but also by employers and the government. Costs are not set by individuals or organizations but by public and private insurance companies. Good health is such an important priority that everyone wants the best medicine, no matter how much it costs.",

    "description": "Thomas Frank admits Tottenham captain Christian Romero's week ended in a \"perfect storm\" with a red card at Manchester United.",
    "fullText": "Tottenham boss Thomas Frank called it the \"perfect storm\".\n\nOther assessments are available of Cristian Romero's lunge at Manchester United midfielder Casemiro half an hour into their Premier League game at Old Trafford.\n\nAt the end of a week during which Romero has been at the centre of attention after he publicly condemned the Spurs hierarchy for their failure to invest in the squad, the Argentina defender once again left Frank to defend him.\n\nThe match, which was goalless when he was shown a straight red card for the foul on Casemiro, ended in a 2-0 defeat for Spurs.\n\n\"He apologised to his team-mates in the dressing room,\" said Frank afterwards, having argued on Friday that too much attention had been paid to Romero's social media outburst and defended the \"passion\" of his captain.\n\nThe facts were quite simple at Old Trafford.\n\nRomero overhit the ball slightly, so was going to be marginally late as he went to play a pass. The ball flicked up off Casemiro's left foot, which meant Romero struck his opponent's right with full force on the shin, before he played the ball.\n\nThere was little time - but those are the fine margins that exist in the Premier League.\n\nAccording to the Premier League Match Centre, Romero's challenge met the threshold for serious foul play because it was \"made with excessive force and endangered an opponent\".\n\nFormer Premier League official Darren Cann agreed with the decision.\n\n\"Romero makes a forceful challenge on Casemiro which is, in law, undoubtedly a serious foul play tackle,\" Cann told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It was a really excellent decision from referee Michael Oliver, who was brilliantly positioned.\"\n\nNot even Frank could argue Oliver was wrong to send Romero off.\n\n\"The red card is a red card,\" he said. \"But I have watched it back five times, he clearly tried to go for the ball.\"\n\nAs Romero had already been sent off once this season, against Liverpool in December, he will now miss Tottenham's next four Premier League games through suspension. He will not feature again domestically until the rematch with Arne Slot's side on 15 March.\n\nBut there are more damning statistics than that.\n\nTwice - in different games against Brentford - the Premier League's Key Match Incidents panel concluded he got away with tackles he should have been sent off for.\n\nNonetheless, Romero has still become the first player to be red carded twice in the Premier League this season. He now has four in the league since he joined Tottenham in 2021, the most of any player during this period, and the joint-most for anyone from the club in the competition overall.\n\nHe has six Spurs red cards in total.\n\n\"I didn't know that,\" admitted Frank when informed of Romero's unhappy record in response to a previous answer.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Frank was asked about the wisdom of having Romero as his captain. In terms of leading by example, it was a very bad look.\n\n\"No, there is not,\" said the Dane in response to whether there is any regret about Romero's status.\n\n\"I think it is fair to say he doesn't have any intention to get a red card after 28 minutes. He is sorry for the incident. He apologised to his team-mates in the dressing room. He is one of the most important players.\"\n\nFrank's answer to whether he would consider taking the armband off Romero was predictable.\n\nIt was the same succinct manner he used later to a point that Romero was not helping a team that were already without 10 senior players at kick-off, and subsequently also lost full-back Destiny Udogie to injury.\n\nGoalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario also defended his team-mate on TNT Sports.\n\n\"He's our captain and today he made a mistake,\" he said. \"But we know the player he is.\n\n\"He's going to come back stronger, for sure, and he'll help us throughout the rest of the season.\"\n\nBut Match of the Day pundit Danny Murphy was clear Romero \"let his team-mates down\", adding: \"It is irresponsible, especially after a week where he's been talking about recruitment and a lack of players.\n\n\"He's the captain, the leader - he needs to do better.\"\n\nMurphy wasn't the only pundit critical of Romero.\n\n\"You just know he's got that switch,\" Joe Hart, who played for Tottenham among others, told TNT Sports. \"He doesn't need to do that. He just smashes him.\n\n\"Is he a good leader? I don't know. He must be from what we don't see because Thomas Frank seems to stand by him no matter what.\"\n\nFormer Manchester United midfielder Owen Hargreaves was similarly unimpressed.\n\n\"When he looks at it back he'll think 'why did I do that?',\" he said.\n\n\"He's club captain. He needs to be leading by example - but that's not the example he needs to be setting.\"\n\nFrank has made it clear Romero will still be captain when he returns for that Liverpool game, which will split two Champions League last-16 ties, when Juventus and Atletico Madrid are two of the four opponents they could meet.\n\nIn the meantime, he must hope for more level heads because Romero's dismissal led to another defeat. And, with local rivals West Ham starting to pick up points, the spectre of relegation is far too close for comfort.\n\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Tottenham - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — With an impressive performance at a pulsating Madison Square Garden, No. 22 St. John's showed everyone that third-ranked UConn has a legitimate challenger in the Big East this season.\n\nZuby Ejiofor had 21 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists as the Red Storm powered past the Huskies 81-72 on Friday night, snapping their 18-game winning streak.\n\n“We made a lot of big plays tonight, a lot of big plays, and I’m proud of our guys for just not panicking one bit at any point in the game,” Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino said.\n\nIn the first showdown of the year between the Big East's top two teams, Dillon Mitchell added 15 points and Bryce Hopkins scored 14 for the Red Storm (18-5, 11-1), who have won nine straight and 14 of 16. They moved within a half-game of the first-place Huskies (22-2, 12-1) in the conference standings.\n\nThe victory also tied Pitino with Roy Williams for third place in Division I history with 903 career wins on the court.\n\nWhen it was over, a pumped-up Ejiofor went over to the St. John's student section to celebrate. The senior forward, the Big East preseason player of the year, also provided three blocks and two steals in a virtuoso performance.\n\n“Just an all-around great atmosphere to play basketball. Friday night, MSG, great opponent, and, like Coach said, we had more of a home crowd than we thought, and the student crowd was engaged,\" Ejiofor said. \"All the emotions really just flew out.”\n\nSilas Demary Jr. had 18 points, seven rebounds and five assists for UConn, but the junior point guard committed nine of his team’s 15 turnovers in a matchup between the past two Big East champions.\n\n“It was Great Adventure. It was a roller-coaster ride. I mean, it really was. He had some incredible plays,” Huskies coach Dan Hurley said. “We were too loose with the ball.”\n\nAlex Karaban scored 17 for Connecticut before a sold-out crowd of 19,812 filled with roaring fans of both teams — but decidedly in favor of the Johnnies.\n\n“I thought The Garden was as good as I’ve seen it,\" Pitino said. “I thought it was unbelievable how good The Garden was. ... Tremendous crowd.”\n\nSaid Hurley: “I saw a lot of red. That felt like a real road game.”\n\nSt. John’s went 22 for 31 at the free-throw line, while the Huskies were 5 of 12.\n\n“They’re grown men,” Hurley said about the St. John's frontcourt, using a profanity for emphasis. “They’re built for Big East games.”\n\nUConn’s only other defeat this season came on Nov. 19 at home, 71-67 to undefeated Arizona, now the top-ranked team in the country.\n\nThe winning streak was the third-longest in school history.\n\n“We’ve had an unbelievable run,” Hurley said. “We haven’t lost in months.”\n\nUConn shot 55% from the field, including 9 for 19 (47%) on 3-pointers, and held the Johnnies to 5 of 19 (26%) from beyond the arc. Hurley, however, said his team collapsed on defense in the second half and he thought his bench “was skittish a little bit.”\n\nSt. John’s reeled off a 10-0 spurt, capped by a 3 from Hopkins, to open a 55-45 lead with 13 minutes remaining. After trailing by 11, the Huskies responded quickly and cut it to 64-63 on a 3-pointer by Demary with 5:35 left.\n\nBut the Johnnies maintained their slim lead until a step-back 3 by Dylan Darling and a basket inside from Ejiofor made it 74-67 with 2:25 to play. UConn never got closer than four the rest of the way, and Mitchell’s acrobatic tip-in helped the Red Storm hang on.\n\nPitino said he emphasized to his players over and over again to have no fear of failure.\n\n“It was a really passionate game. It was a meaningful game. We knew exactly what we’re playing for,” Ejiofor said. “Our preparation leading up to this game was as great as it’s been. ... We were able to lock in for a full 40 minutes and grind it out, do whatever it takes to win each and every possession.”\n\nIt was the first time the schools squared off at The Garden with both ranked in the AP Top 25 since St. John’s won the 2000 Big East Tournament championship game.\n\nThey meet again Feb. 25 in Hartford, Connecticut.\n\n“I’m certainly going to celebrate tonight,” Pitino said. “We’ve just got to keep it going and try and get better. ... What Bryce, Dillon and Zuby are doing in the frontcourt, it’s pretty special.”\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "description": "The Tennessee Attorney General’s Office issued a consumer alert this week warning homeowners about tree removal scams targeting storm-damaged areas. Complaints have increased about door-to-door crews ...",
    "fullText": "FOREST HILLS, Tenn. (WKRN) — After last week’s ice storm, the damage across Forest Hills and nearby neighborhoods is easy to see: split trees, sagging limbs, yards left exposed. What is harder to spot, state officials say, is the risk that follows close behind.\n\nThe Tennessee Attorney General’s Office issued a consumer alert this week warning homeowners about tree removal scams targeting storm-damaged areas. Complaints have increased about door-to-door crews asking for cash, offering immediate cleanup, and then failing to deliver any work.\n\nFor homeowners eager to clear dangerous trees, the pressure to act can be intense.\n\nOne Nashville homeowner told News 2 he paid more than $6,000 to a company operating under the name Certified Tree Care LLC for tree removal services that were never performed. The homeowner said repeated attempts to reach the company went unanswered.\n\n📧 Have breaking news come to you: \nConcerns about the company have also surfaced publicly online.\n\nIn a post shared on the Tree Climbers Facebook Page, Nashville resident Bailey Brandon warned others not to use Certified Tree Care, describing his own experience following the ice storm and urging homeowners to be cautious before hiring anyone for cleanup. The post has drawn dozens of comments from others sharing similar concerns and frustrations.\n\nNews 2 also attempted to contact the company directly. Calls were routed to an automated voicemail system and were not returned.\n\nThe Better Business Bureau currently gives Certified Tree Care LLC an F rating, citing unresolved complaints.\n\n“Most reputable firms may ask for a deposit, but they should never charge the full amount upfront,” said Robyn Householder, president and CEO of the Better Business Bureau of Middle Tennessee. “Anything beyond fifty percent should be a red flag.”\n\nAt the height of the storm, about 230,000 customers across Middle Tennessee were without power. Many residents were left searching quickly for help to clear fallen trees blocking driveways, threatening homes, or resting on power lines.\n\nThe homeowner who contacted News 2 believes he is not alone and claims dozens of others may have had similar experiences since the storm. That number has not been independently verified.\n\nTrevor Cochran, a partner with Tree Job, a licensed and insured tree removal company operating locally, said pressure is often the first warning sign.\n\n“A pushy sales rep is always something to be cautious of,” Cochran said. “If someone is rushing you or singling you out, there is usually a reason, and it is not a good one.”\n\nCochran said homeowners should always insist on a written estimate that clearly states the total cost before any work begins.\n\n“If they cannot give you a final price in writing, walk away,” he said. “Once you sign something without details, you lose control of the situation.”\n\nThe Better Business Bureau and the Attorney General’s Office recommend homeowners look for credentials such as Certified Arborist, which requires training through the International Society of Arboriculture. Officials also suggest choosing companies affiliated with organizations like the Tree Care Industry Association or the American Society of Consulting Arborists.\n\n⏩ Read today’s top stories on wkrn.com\n\nHomeowners are advised to ask what cleanup is included, verify proof of insurance, and never allow work to begin without a signed contract outlining costs, scope of work, and start and completion dates.\n\nInsurance matters, officials warn. If an uninsured worker is injured while performing tree work on private property, the homeowner may be held financially responsible.\n\n“Your greatest asset is patience,” Householder said. “Taking the time to verify who you are hiring can save you a lot of money and a lot of headaches later.”\n\nAfter a storm, speed can feel like the answer. State officials said that when it comes to tree removal, slowing down may be what protects homeowners most.\n\nNews 2 left a message on Wednesday for Certified Tree Care LLC about Bailey’s complaint. Thursday, Certified Tree Care LLC general manager Bryan Koepke said a crew began work but trees were still icy, which presented a safety concern. He said the crew left but intended to go back.",

We found the dog, ‍but not her,\" Malaga fire chief Manuel Marmolejo said on Spanish television.\n\nA search party of more than 30 people using helicopters and drones was still searching for her, police said.\n\nSpain's Deputy Prime Minister Maria Jesus Montero said 148 roads had ​been affected by lane closures, especially in Cadiz province, and 3,500 police have been deployed to help ‌with evacuations.\n\nSTORM MARTA THE NEXT TO HIT IBERIA\n\nStorm Marta, the next weather front in the so-called \"storm train\", is expected to hit the region over the weekend, according to state weather agency Aemet.\n\nReconstruction costs in Portugal after last week's Storm Kristin alone could total over 4 billion euros ($4.7 billion), Economy Minister Manuel Castro Almeida said.\n\nPeople waded waist-deep through Alcacer do Sal in southern Portugal after successive storms caused the river Sado to breach its ⁠banks. Restaurant terraces were completely underwater, with sandbags stacked in front ​of doors to protect homes and shops.\n\n\"I've never seen anything ​like this. It's surreal,\" said resident Maria Cadacha. \"There are a lot of people here, very good people, many shopkeepers, homes with damage. I wouldn't want to be in their shoes.\"\n\nFourteen ‍rivers and 10 dams were ⁠at \"extreme\" risk of overflowing, Antonio Sanz, head of the regional government's interior department said on Wednesday.\n\nSeville on Thursday closed the Guadalquivir river floodgates to protect the historic neighborhood of Triana from flooding, only ⁠the second time it has done so since their construction in 2011.\n\nPolice cordoned off an area around Seville's cathedral after pieces from ‌its Giralda bell tower fell due to strong winds.",

That's how one woman described the storm she's living through—financial, emotional, and structural—after discovering her husband was secretly funneling his \"fun money\" into conversations with a woman behind bars.\n\nThe story unraveled during a recent episode of \"The Ramsey Show,\" where co-hosts Rachel Cruze and George Kamel took a call from a woman named Caroline. Four months earlier, she checked their phone bill and spotted some unfamiliar numbers. Her husband, who always claimed to be broke and anxiously awaited his next cash allowance, had apparently been in contact with a prison pen pal. Not for a few weeks.

While he initially claimed he was \"trapped,\" Kamel pushed back hard: \"No, he wasn't trapped. He was willfully doing this on his own volition.\"\n\nCruze confirmed the obvious question: yes, it was the same incarcerated woman the entire time. The money, Caroline later learned, was used to fund commissary accounts or similar prison expenses.\n\n\"He just got caught up in it,\" she said. \"But he never told me—he just kept hiding it.\"\n\nAnd for Caroline, the emotional betrayal wasn't the only wreckage to deal with. Shortly after uncovering the truth, a tree fell on their home. \"So we were dealing with a hole in our marriage and a hole in our house,\" she said.

But she admitted she doesn't feel like she has the whole story.\n\n\"He said it won't be good. It's just so dark,\" she recalled, referring to her husband's response when she asked him to go to counseling.\n\n\"You can't move forward with half the truth,\" Cruze told her. \"There's no way.\"",

    "fullText": "New US-owned app struggled with a storm and was accused of blocking content critical of Trump – can it recover?\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m Blake Montgomery, writing to you from Doha, where I’m moderating panels about AI and investing as part of the Web Summit Qatar.\n\nI want to bring your attention to the impact of a Guardian story. In December, we published a story, “‘A black hole’: families and police say tech giants delay investigations in child abuse and drug cases”, about grieving families and law enforcement officers who say that Meta and Snapchat have slowed down criminal investigations. (The tech companies contend that they cooperate.) This month, Colorado lawmakers introduced a bill to compel social media platforms to respond to warrants in 72 hours.\n\nNearly two weeks ago, TikTok stepped on to US shores as a naturalized citizen. Ever since, the video app has been fighting for its life. It endured a major outage that stifled users’ ability to upload videos, which fueled a fierce user backlash over perceived censorship. Now it’s facing an ascendant competitor and an inquiry by the California governor.\n\nTikTok’s calamitous emigration began on 22 January when its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, finalized a deal to sell the app to a group of US investors, among them the business software giant Oracle. The day after the deal closed, its new owners altered its privacy policy to permit more extensive data collection.\n\nDuring the weekend that followed, the US weathered a fearsome winter storm and the killing of an American citizen by federal immigration agents. Both knocked TikTok off its feet.\n\nWinter Storm Fern crippled multiple Oracle datacenters that TikTok relies on. The app suffered severe outages as a result. Many users said they were unable to upload videos. Others said their videos received zero views despite significant followings. Many of those same users cried censorship as they tried to express their outrage over Alex Pretti’s death via TikTok and found they could not. Prominent personalities said they would leave the app.\n\nAfter days of outcry, TikTok issued a statement ascribing the problems to the snow, ice and cold. That did not stop California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, from announcing the next day that his office would investigate the app’s alleged suppression of content critical of Donald Trump.\n\nTikTok’s late attribution of blame did little to assuage public criticism. The exodus has propelled a new competitor, Upscrolled, which promises less censorship than TikTok, to the top spot in the US Apple App Store and the third spot in the Google Play Store. Upscrolled’s founder said in a conversation at the Web Summit Qatar that the app now boasts more than 2.5 million users.\n\nWith more than a billion users worldwide, it seems unlikely that TikTok will altogether vanish as a result of these failures. TikTok’s first week in the US does not bode well, though.\n\nElon Musk had more extensive ties to Epstein than previously known, emails show\n\nTesla discontinues Model X and S vehicles as Elon Musk pivots to robotics\n\nTwo dramas, both showing in New York, are highlighting how our collective anxieties about technology have shifted in the decade between their premieres.\n\nMarjorie Prime, now revived on Broadway but first staged in 2014, follows Tess (Cynthia Nixon), as she deals with the ageing, death and robotic recreation of her mother (June Squibb). The world of the play features “Primes”, android lookalikes of real people that attempt to emulate them for the comfort of those left behind, which Tess and her mother both engage with. Picture an Alexa, but it’s your dead husband, grandmother, etc. The play brings to mind the early worries about Siri, which debuted three years before the play. Since then, we’ve seen our own real-life versions of Primes: millions of people have digitally copied their deceased loved ones to varying degrees of uncanniness and success. Though its predictions are no longer far-fetched, the play remains moving. I found it touching.\n\nData, which premiered off Broadway last week, follows the talented young programmer Maneesh (Karan Brar) after he joins Athena Technologies, a clear analogue for the very real company Palantir. Maneesh is inducted into the company’s most elite team, data analytics, where he learns about clandestine work with the US government. He struggles with the ethics of the project. He wrestles with whether to expose it to the world in hopes of tanking it or keeping his head down. The play’s themes are quite familiar. They were playing out in headlines two days before I attended, and the Guardian has published stories about them.\n\nData is paced and plotted like a political thriller, more like House of Cards than Her. Seeing the two plays within a week of each other, I was struck by how much our concerns with tech have moved from the realm of science fiction into that of realism. Marjorie Prime is less literally concerned with tech, more with its emotional consequences. Data is about what it means to literally work as a software engineer. It seems unlikely to me that a play about the ethics of software in US bureaucracy could have sustained any tension in an era before this one.\n\nMarjorie Prime imagines a melancholy future; Data chronicles a version of the unpleasant present. The very real events of the previous year and Silicon Valley’s entanglement with the Trump administration loom over Data, for better and for worse. The play could not be more timely; it may feel dated by the end of year. Watching it felt like reading a yarn in the Wall Street Journal (or the Guardian, if I’m flattering myself).\n\nI am curious to observe which play ages better. Data serves as a real-time, red-hot record of our current moment, which may cool quickly. During the play, I was intrigued by some of its villains’ seemingly nefarious arguments in favor of the company’s work. What if the main character exposes the evil in the press and nothing happens, as his boss says? I have been part of multiple news cycles where that has been the case. What will plucky 22-year-old Maneesh do then? The question presents a more interesting, nuanced response to reality than Maneesh’s black-and-white, do-or-die plan to blow things up. By contrast, Marjorie Prime’s sentient artificial intelligence acts as a vehicle to discuss the age-old grief of a parent’s death and its aftermath.\n\nThe central question that both plays ask is not, in the end, one explicitly about technology, but about how to keep living beneath crushing weight. In Marjorie Prime, Tess struggles with the repetitiveness of her days and the robotic, constant reminder of her mother. She eventually succumbs to her despair, replaced by a robot herself, which torments her grieving husband with its pale simulation. In Data’s final, devastating scene, the secondary hero, Riley (Sophia Lillis, who gives the play’s best performance), asks how she can just go back to work, plagued as she is by moral concerns but trapped by monetary need, after failing to stop the company’s work. She trembles as her phone beeps, reminding her she’s late for her next meeting.\n\nWhat is Moltbook?

    "description": "After a severe storm, you may stumble upon old pieces of cars in Misquamicut Beach. Read the quirky story behind how they ended up buried in the sand",
    "fullText": "Some years ago, The Andrea, a seasonal seafood restaurant on the west end of Misquamicut Beach in Westerly, posted a black-and-white photo on Facebook showing a line of cars buried in the sand.\n\nThe cars, about 20 of them, had their windows smashed and looked as though they were made in the 1940s or 1950s.\n\n“Tell me what you think you know about the cars. Free drink to whoever comes close to the truth behind the cars. ... Good luck!” the post said.\n\nThe post generated more than 300 guesses. Some of them were submitted by people just having fun.\n\n“These cars were all impounded for parking illegally in front of the Ocean House,” joked one person.\n\n“People trying to avoid the 20.00 parking fee at the state beach?” asked another.\n\n“Used car dealer that went under so to speak,” punned a third.\n\nSome, however, were closer to the mark.\n\n“There was a flood, I think back in 54, the cars got buried,” went one guess. “The cars were left there covered with sand as a blockade/barrier in front of the Andrea hotel. I believe after Hurricane Sandy, you could see some of the cars again.”\n\nRebecca Colucci, whose family owns The Andrea, remembers the story of the buried cars.\n\n“The year was 1954,” she told The Providence Journal. “Hurricane Carol came first and then we were hit by Hurricane Edna. It may be the only time in history that New England was hit with two category 3 hurricanes in one year.”\n\nThe storm left many cars with water damage. Ralph Colucci, Rebecca’s grandfather, offered to pick them up and dispose of them.\n\n“His idea was to bury them as deep as he could and create a barrier against coastal storms. He lined the cars up, smashed the windows and put heavy chains around the cars linking them together,” Colucci said.\n\nRalph Colucci apparently buried cars twice, once in 1954 and again in the 1960s, according to Nina Wright, who oversees special collections and reference at the Westerly Library.\n\nA news clip from 1967 seems to confirm this account.\n\n“For many years Ralph Colucci, owner of a beach-front hotel on Misquamicut Beach, had the problem of beach erosion causing damage to his hotel when the ocean would [wash] away the sand bank in front of his hotel,” the clip reads. “Two years ago Colucci had a row of junk cars buried in a long ditch and covered with sand. So far the cars have prevented the sand bank from being washed away”\n\nSince then, storms have unearthed pieces of the cars. Thomas Gulluscio, president of the Westerly Historical Society, said locals used to gauge the severity of storms by whether they exhumed Colucci’s buried cars.\n\n“I do remember as a kid saying, ‘Oh boy, the storm last night was so bad you could see the cars at the end here,’” Gulluscio said.\n\nOther locals, in comments on Facebook, reminisce playing as children along the sand and seeing the exposed vehicles after storms.\n\nHurricane Sandy in 2012 was one of the most severe storms to hit Misquamicut Beach. It caused severe damage to The Andrea, which until then had been a hotel. The Colucci family tore down the building, preserving the hotel’s old historic fireplace, and built a restaurant in its place.\n\nRebecca Colucci remembers after Hurricane Sandy finding a car part under the patio area close to the main building.\n\n“We have always removed them and disposed of them properly, but there might be a few more,” she said.\n\nAs for who got a free drink for correctly guessing the story of the cars, she is not sure.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Providence Journal: Section of Misquamicut Beach has cars buried in it to reduce erosion",

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — The seven victims of a marine disaster that devastated a storied Massachusetts fishing town included a fifth-generation fisherman, a young federal fisheries observer and a father-and-son crew duo. All died when their fishing boat, the Lily Jean, sank in waters off America’s oldest seaport.\n\nThe sinking underscored the risks long inherent in Gloucester’s fishing industry, which spans more than 400 years and was famously chronicled in “The Perfect Storm.” The names of the crew will be added to a city memorial honoring thousands of fishermen lost at sea over generations.\n\nThe 72-foot (22-meter) vessel was returning to port early Friday to repair fishing gear when it sank in frigid Atlantic waters. The U.S. Coast Guard announced Monday that it was launching a formal investigation into the sinking after suspending a search for survivors Saturday. It has not said what might have caused the sinking, though it said ice buildup from freezing ocean spray can cause a boat to capsize.\n\n“You fish in federal waters, you fish in a Gloucester boat, and you lose your life, you’re forever a Gloucester fisherman,” Gloucester fisherman Al Cottone said.\n\nCoast Guard officials identified the victims Monday as captain Accursio “Gus” Sanfilippo and crewmembers Paul Beal Sr., Paul Beal Jr., John Rousanidis, Freeman Short and Sean Therrien. Also aboard was Jada Samitt, a fisheries observer for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nOn Monday, the community was quick to push back against speculation about a possible cause, recalling Sanfilippo as someone who cared about his crew and didn't take risks.\n\nVito Giacalone, head of the Gloucester Fishing Community Preservation Fund, said such sinkings are unfortunately not out of the ordinary.\n\n“We’ve had multiple sinkings. All hands lost. No radio communication at the very last minute. Nobody alive to say, oh, no, it wasn’t that,\" he said. \"So, it’s just unfair to everyone involved with the folks that were lost feeling like someone did something wrong.”\n\n“All those guys on that boat were seasoned fishermen,” former Lily Jean crew member Gryphon Orfanos said while doing boat repairs Monday at the same dock where the Lily Jean used to tie up. “They knew how dangerous it was.”\n\nOrfanos and friend Nate Dennen attached a stainless steel memorial cross with the name “Lily Jean” to a wooden beam at the dock.\n\nDennen, a longtime friend of the boat's captain Gus, said he was a mentor who looked out for his crew.\n\n“It taught me everything I know,” Orfanos said of his more than a year working on the Lily Jean — his first offshore fishing job. “Out on the ocean, it teaches you everything. But as far as I want the word to spread, Gus was the best guy ever.”\n\nCottone said any vessel leaving port needs a Coast Guard inspection decal, which requires up-to-date safety equipment — and the fishery observer conducts a safety check before each outing.\n\n“If the observer deems the boat not to be safe or have any piece of safety equipment that’s not up to date ... that observer will shut the trip down,” he said.\n\nSanfilippo was well known in Gloucester. The Lily Jean, Sanfilippo, and his crew were featured in a 2012 episode of the History Channel show “Nor’Easter Men.” The captain is described as a fifth-generation commercial fisherman, out of Gloucester, in the Georges Bank. The crew is shown working in dangerous weather conditions for hours on end, spending as many as 10 days offshore catching haddock, lobster and flounder.\n\n“We loved each other,” Giacalone said. “He treated me like a big brother and I treated him like my younger brother. To know the tragedy of this and to know the kind of character that Gus had, he’d be mortified to know that these lives were all lost.”\n\nGiacalone said the Sanfillipo and Beal names were synonymous with local fishing going back decades. He said Sanfillipo “followed in the footsteps of his dad\" while the Beal family has built boats and a brother is also a fisherman.\n\n“Those two families are absolutely etched in centuries of these multiple generations of fishermen,” Giacalone said.\n\nCrew made of veterans and newcomers\n\nJust as Sanfillipo had years of experience, Samitt was undertaking her first job at sea as an observer. The 22-year-old was tasked with collecting data from the catch, used for making government regulations and other purposes.\n\nSamitt’s family said in a statement that she was originally from Virginia and had a deep love of Gloucester’s fishing community and \"conveyed to us how critical it was to protect the seas and fisheries.”\n\nNOAA, meanwhile, offered its condolences.\n\n“Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with Jada’s family, the families of the six fishermen, the NOAA observer community, and everyone affected,” its statement said.\n\nTherrien, 44, was working his first season on a commercial fishing vessel, joining the Lily Jean after his close friend Rousanidis said the boat needed another crew member, his partner Becky Carp said. He had been on about a half-dozen trips already, she said, and appeared to be settling into the job despite complaints about the cold.\n\nTherrien, she said, was \"always up for an adventure” but took thed job mostly so he could provide for his family. The lifelong Massachusetts resident was the family's breadwinner and sought to supplement his construction work, which was scarce in the winter.\n\n“He wanted to make sure his family was safe and taken care which is why he was busting his butt,” Carp said.\n\nCarp last talked to Therrien on Tuesday before he headed out. She had wanted him to take the week off to spend time with him but he felt he needed to make money. She only learned about the sinking when alerts began popping up Friday.\n\n“You always want to hold out hope that they are found. Come Saturday morning, I kind of knew at that point that they wouldn’t find any survivors,” Carp said. “I feel like it’s a nightmare that I am going to wake up from. It's just a bad dream and everything will be OK. But unfortunately, it's not.\"\n\nWhittle reported from Scarborough, Maine.",

    "description": "Some American Airlines flight attendants were left \"stranded in airport terminals and hotel lobbies,\" the APFA union said.",
    "fullText": "American Airlines has started the process of compensating flight attendants after Winter Storm Fern, as tensions flare between the union and management.\n\nOver 9,000 of its flights were canceled, marking the largest weather-related disruption in its history, the airline said. A union for flight attendants said some crew were left \"stranded in airport terminals and hotel lobbies with no accommodations.\"\n\nIn a Saturday letter to flight attendants, seen by Business Insider, the airline outlined how to make compensation claims.\n\nThe Association of Professional Flight Attendants, the union, told members on Sunday that this letter \"constitutes the company's acknowledgment that it failed to uphold the Collective Bargaining Agreement during Winter Storm Fern.\"\n\nBoth letters refer to compensation for delays in being assigned a hotel, and say that flight attendants can be reimbursed if they paid for hotel rooms or transportation.\n\nAmerican Airlines had the most cancellations of any carrier during Winter Storm Fern — in part because of disruption at its main hub, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. There were four inches of snowfall and freezing rain, per the National Weather Service. The impact was outsize because it doesn't have the same infrastructure for dealing with winter weather as airports in the northeast.\n\nAPFA's letter also referred to compensation for \"illegally rescheduling\" reserve flight attendants to work during flex days or golden days. The latter is effectively a contractually protected day off that may not be moved without mutual consent, per the APFA.\n\nAPFA referred to a part of the collective bargaining agreement that says flight attendants can be paid time and a half for the whole trip if they have to work on days off. Some crew scheduling errors could lead to 50% extra pay, it said.\n\n\"Now that the storm is largely behind us, the focus turns to holding the company accountable by ensuring management compensates Flight Attendants for the violations,\" the union told members.\n\nIt added that it expects the airline to provide \"appropriate compensation without delay.\"\n\nAmerican Airlines could not be reached for immediate comment.\n\nLast week, APFA also said that flight attendants would receive double pay for any flights last Wednesday, as American worked to get its operations back on track as the storm subsided.\n\nTensions between the union and airline management have intensified as American's profits have lagged those of competitors.\n\nAmerican last week reported a pre-tax profit of $352 million for 2025, down 80% from the year before. While United Airlines' adjusted pre-tax profit was $4.6 billion, and Delta Air Lines' $5 billion for the year.\n\nAPFA subsequently called for new leadership, citing \"a pattern of failure under the leadership of CEO Robert Isom and the American Airlines board of directors.\"\n\nDo you work for an airline?

    "fullText": "EDITOR’S NOTE:  Great Escapes is a series about how sometimes travel doesn’t go as planned — and what happens next.\n\nPeering out the Greyhound bus window, Diann Droste saw the snow coming down fast and thick.\n\n“I remember I was looking out the window and thinking, ‘I don’t know that this is good,’” Diann tells CNN Travel today. “I started to see cars in the ditches, and then I saw semis in the ditches. But I’m 16. And I don’t know what happens in a situation like that, so I just read my book.”\n\nIt was January 1973. Diann was a high school junior living in Waterloo, Iowa. She was on her way home from visiting her pen pal, who lived in Brainerd, Minnesota — “the real northern part of Minnesota, where it’s really cold.” The bus ride took more than 10 hours.\n\n“Those Greyhounds make a lot of stops. There was one transfer where I got off the first bus and got on a second,” recalls Diann today. “My children think it’s unusual that I was riding Greyhound buses around the country when I was 16. But we didn’t have money for airplanes.”\n\nDiann describes herself as “pretty fearless,” back then. Or maybe she was just “a teenager at a different time.” Either way, riding a Greyhound bus alone didn’t intimidate her — until the snow started. As the view out of the window disappeared into white, Diann tried to focus on the book in her lap.\n\n“Snow is nothing unusual in the Midwest in January. But very soon, it was snowing hard and the bus was sliding,” she recalls.\n\nThe mood on the bus seemed to shift as well.\n\n“I remember thinking these other people on this bus — and the bus was just about completely full — seem a little nervous,” says Diann.\n\nShe was a broke teenager stranded in a strange town. Then two nuns saved the day\n\nThere was a collective sense of relief when the bus arrived in the city of Albert Lea, Minnesota. The bus driver exited the interstate and parked outside a Holiday Inn.\n\n“He stopped the bus and said, ‘We can’t go any farther. It’s not safe for me to drive, so we’re going to spend the night here,’” Diann recalls.\n\nFor Diann, panic set in immediately.\n\n“Instantly, I thought, ‘Uh oh.’…I had no idea buses stopped like that.”\n\nDiann didn’t have any money. That’s one part of this story her kids still can’t believe. She’d brought about $25 for the trip, and now, on the return leg, she only had a few dollars left.\n\nShe got off the bus, pulled her coat tight around her neck and looked at the other passengers. Everyone else headed straight into the motel. Everyone else also seemed much older — people who instinctively knew what to do when travel plans fell apart.\n\nDiann spotted a pay phone and used a few of her remaining coins to call home. She told her mother what had happened but tried not to alarm her.\n\n“When I told my kids this, I said, ‘Now, if that ever happens to you, call me. I have a credit card.’” Diann says. “But in 1972, ‘73 no one had a cell phone, not everybody had a credit card.”\n\nHer mom didn’t have one. Albert Lea was still two hours from Waterloo, and the weather conditions were too dangerous for her mother to drive to pick her up.\n\n“It was snowing in Iowa also and they were expecting up to a foot of snow overnight,” Diann recalls.\n\nWhen she hung up, she feared she might be stranded for days.\n\nInside the Holiday Inn, Diann sat down in a chair in the hotel lobby, under the fluorescent lights. She watched as the other passengers lined up at the front desk, and got rooms.\n\n“No one seemed to even notice me,” she says. “And they all got their rooms and left, and I was sitting in the chair.”\n\nThere were no families among the group. No young people — just what Diann thought of as “real adults.” And she was alone and unsure what to do.\n\n“I can’t get a room, because I don’t have any money,” she told herself. She tried to stay calm and formulate a plan. She spotted a sign behind the desk advertising free breakfast.\n\n“That’s something,” she thought. “I’ll stay in this lobby overnight, and in the morning, I’ll eat the free breakfast, and hopefully the bus leaves in the morning.”\n\nThe chair wasn’t very comfortable. It was far from an ideal sleeping situation. And Diann didn’t exactly feel at ease in a motel lobby in the middle of nowhere.\n\nBut she had her book and tried to distract herself by reading.\n\nEventually, the lobby emptied. It seemed like all the other Greyhound bus passengers had got their rooms. Then Diann peered over her page to see two pairs of black shoes click-clacking across the lobby floor.\n\n“I thought, ‘Those women are wearing very sensible shoes,’” Diann recalls. “It’s funny the things you remember.”\n\nShe looked up. They were two women she recognized from the bus.\n\n“They were probably in their, I’d say, mid-50s, and they were dressed very plainly,” says Diann.\n\nDark skirts. White blouses. Those sensible shoes.\n\nThey smiled at her and kept walking.\n\n“They almost got to the door, and they turned around and they said, ‘Would you like to join us for dinner?’”\n\nNext to the motel was a Perkins, the chain restaurant often found just off US interstates.\n\nAt the mention of food, Diann’s stomach rumbled. She was hungry. But she was also broke.\n\n“I didn’t want to tell them I didn’t have any money. I just said ‘No, thank you.’ So they said, ‘Okay,’ and they walked out the door,” says Diann.\n\nBut, moments later the sensible shoes returned.\n\n“No kidding, they turned right back around, came back in, and one of them said to me, ‘Will you join us for dinner if we pay for your dinner?’” recalls Diann. “They must have known. I’m sure they knew.”\n\nDiann headed out into the snow with the two women. She had a moment of thinking: “I shouldn’t be doing this.” They were strangers. Perhaps it wasn’t safe. But sitting alone in a motel lobby didn’t feel especially safe, either.\n\nAt the restaurant, feeling guilty about the idea of two strangers buying her dinner, Diann ordered only a small Coke.\n\nDiann’s new friends immediately intervened. “One of the women said: ‘And she will have a hamburger and french fries to go with that.’ So, when the waitress left, I said to them, ‘I don’t have any money to pay for this.’ They said, ‘We told you we were paying for your dinner.’”\n\nThey were warm, but firm. Diann relented. And as she sipped her Coke, she began to relax a little and the group started chatting.\n\nThe two women said they were Sisters of Mercy, Catholic nuns.\n\n“That explains the shoes,” Diann thought.\n\nThe nuns told her they taught at a Catholic high school in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, about an hour from Diann’s home. Diann is Catholic and she knew the school, which made her relax a little more. Still, now aware she was dining with two teachers who were also nuns — a first for her on both counts — she was also on her best behavior.\n\n“They asked me what I was going to do, and I didn’t understand the question. So, I said, ‘Well, I’m only a junior in high school, but I’d like to go to college. I don’t know where.’”\n\nThe two women smiled at each other, and then at Diann.\n\n“They said, ‘We mean tonight,’ and I said, ‘Oh, well, I think I’m going to stay in the lobby and maybe sleep in a chair.’”\n\nShe saw concern on the two nuns’ faces.\n\n“In the morning, hopefully we can leave,” said Diann, rambling a bit now. “And I can eat breakfast there, because there’s free breakfast …”\n\nThe nuns looked at each other, nodding.\n\n“And one of them said, ‘We have a room with two queen beds. Would you like to stay with us?’” Diann recalls.\n\nLooking back, Diann knows how it sounds. Like “something from ‘Dateline,’” she says. “It probably was not the most prudent thing to do, but I felt completely safe with these two women, and I really didn’t want to sleep in the lobby,” she says.\n\nSo, she agreed to share their room. Over burgers and fries, Diann became more comfortable with the situation.\n\n“I started out kind of shy with them, but before dinner was over, I was telling them everything. I was telling them what I did in school, and I have five siblings, and I was telling them about that,” she says.\n\n“Would I have felt that comfortable with other adults? I don’t think so. I don’t think I was that comfortable with most of my teachers or anything. … They made me comfortable; in an ordinary situation, I wouldn’t have been that forthcoming with them.”\n\nBack in the motel room, the group played the card game canasta.\n\n“They taught me how to play and I’ve never played it again. But when I hear the name ‘canasta,’ I think of those two nuns.”\n\nThe game was fun. The trio laughed and joked as they played. The Sisters, used to interacting with teenagers from their teaching work, made Diann feel increasingly at ease.\n\n“I was completely safe, completely,” says Diann. “They slept in one bed, I slept in the other. We went to bed kind of early. Woke up early. We went downstairs to have breakfast.”\n\nThe atmosphere at breakfast was warm and inviting, different from the night before, when the bus passengers had largely ignored each other.\n\n“The whole climate had changed … People were moving back and forth between the breakfast tables, talking,” says Diann. “It was like camaraderie among the people that were on the bus, people that didn’t know each other before, all were talking because we had shared this experience.”\n\nDiann sat at a table with the nuns. The bus driver assured them no more snow was forecast, so they could leave that morning. Everyone cheered.\n\nAn hour later Diann was back on the bus. This time, she didn’t open her book but continued chatting to the nuns and other passengers.\n\n“I sat talking to these two nuns, and I had the best time,” she recalls. “Of all the traveling on buses I did when I was young, I think that was the best trip, just because I met them and got to know them.”\n\nThe Greyhound started approaching her home city. Diann spotted Waterloo’s familiar, eight storey Black’s Building department store.\n\n“I was never so happy to see that tall building on the horizon as I was that day,” says Diann.\n\nShe knew she was almost home, so she turned to the nuns.\n\n“I said to them, ‘If you give me your name and address, I will send you money for my share of the hotel room.’ They said, ‘Absolutely not.’ And then they wouldn’t tell me where they lived. I said, ‘Well, just tell me where you live. You must live in a convent …”\n\nThe nuns batted away the questions. “No, no, no,” they said. They insisted Diann didn’t need to pay them back for their kindness.\n\nThe bus pulled to a stop in Waterloo. Out the window, Diann saw her mother waiting to pick her up.\n\n“My mom was always waiting when I returned but this time I was especially grateful to see her and get home,” recalls Diann.\n\nShe turned to the nuns, pointing excitedly.\n\n“I told them, ‘Oh good, my mom is here.’ And they said, ‘Can we bless you?’ And I said, ‘Yes.’ And they said a little prayer.”\n\nThen Diann got off the bus waving goodbye to the nuns and her fellow passengers.\n\nThat evening, Diann regaled her family with the tale. Her mother expressed her thanks for the nuns’ kindness. Later, in her bedroom, Diann composed a letter to her pen pal, Arlene, writing in detail about the eventful journey back home.\n\n“When I went back to school, which was probably within a day or two, I remember telling my friends, and they said, ‘You slept in a room with two people you didn’t even know?’ I said, ‘It just doesn’t make sense, does it?’”\n\nDiann no longer recalls the nuns’ names. At the time, it didn’t occur to her to look them up to thank them.\n\n“In today’s world, I could have easily found out who they were,” she reflects. “The internet would have made it easy. I guess I could have written a letter to the school. But I was also 16 and, as I said, 16-year-old girls are pretty clueless.”\n\nNot long afterward, Diann got her driver’s license and quit riding Greyhounds. She didn’t visit Arlene again. “Maybe I was scared off doing it again after that trip,” she laughs. The two lost touch when Diann went to college but recently reconnected on Facebook and learned they’d both gone on to become nurses.\n\n“I was a registered nurse for 40 years,” Diann says today. “I am married. I am a mother of three and a grandmother of six. She was married and had three kids like mine. Amazing how our lives paralleled each other.”\n\nThe two women have since met up a handful of times — though they’ve not traveled by Greyhound bus to do so.\n\nIn the five decades since her stayover in Albert Lea, Diann has told her “nuns on the bus” story to her kids and grandkids on many occasions.\n\nShe’s used to the quizzical looks at her lack of money, trusting nature and the unlikelihood of the whole thing. But the most important part of the story, for Diann, is how experiencing this kindness from strangers as a teenager shaped her outlook on life.\n\n“When I worked, I had a small note on my desk,” she says. “I read it several times a day and it became my mantra, words I tried to live by. That note said: ‘When you have a choice between being right or being kind, choose kind.’ All these years later, I still remember that great act of kindness by two very kind and intuitive nuns. I tell this story often.\n\n“I was grateful they were there, and I hope that they knew that. I’m sure they’ve long passed away at this point, but I hope they knew that what they did that night affected me forever. And in some ways, I’ve tried to pay it forward. I’ve never had a stranger sleep in my hotel room, but I have been nice to strangers and gone out of my way for them.\n\n“Sometimes I think people just fall into your life for a reason, and those people, those two women, fell into my life for a reason. I’ve often hoped that they thought of me afterward, because I’ve certainly thought of them every single year,” she says.",

    "fullText": "Sixty years ago this week, a massive and deadly snowstorm in the Northeast -- and the Arctic outbreak that swept in behind it -- set state weather records that still stand today.\n\nLater overshadowed by bigger blizzards such as the Blizzard of 1978, this tempest will never be forgotten by the families of the 201 people killed during the storm.\n\nMore than a foot of snow piled up from Virginia to Maine. Extreme cold followed the snow, with state record lows set that are still on the books today in Alabama and Mississippi. New Market, Alabama, hit 27 degrees below zero on Jan. 30, while Corinth, Mississippi, fell to 19 below zero.\n\nImmense lake-effect snowfall fell near Oswego, New York, during and after the storm, where a total of 103 inches was measured. At Camden, 50 inches of snow fell, setting New York's all-time 24-hour snowfall record, which is still on the books today. Schools in Oswego were closed for a week. Bulldozers had to be used to remove snow, with helicopters flying in supplies and medical help.\n\nEvery major city from Maryland to New York got more than a foot of snow from the storm:\n\n• Pittsburgh, PA: 14.4 inches\n• Washington, DC: 13.8 inches\n• Allentown, PA: 13.3 inches\n• Philadelphia, PA: 12.7 inches\n• Baltimore, MD: 12.1 inches\n\nAn estimated 201 people were killed from heart attacks while shoveling snow, traffic accidents, cold or in fires started by people trying to heat their homes.\n\nWhile this storm went down in the history books as the Blizzard of 1966, it should not be confused with the deadly March blizzard in the Northern Plains, which is sometimes referred to by the same name.",

    "description": "D.D....",
    "fullText": "The mayor publicizes a $12 billion hole in New York’s budget over the next two years—and draws some political battle lines.\n\nThe honeymoon is officially over.\n\nThat was the deeper meaning of Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s somber Wednesday morning City Hall press conference disclosing the not-exactly-shocking news that regarding the next two fiscal years New York faces a $12 billion hole in the city’s finances. The budget gap itself was old news, disclosed first by Comptroller Mark Levine nearly two weeks ago—in an announcement whose details owed much to his predecessor, former comptroller Brad Lander’s final report, which had projected “a $2.18 billion gap for FY 2026…a gap of $10.41 billion [in FY 2027], $13.24 billion in FY 2028, and $12.36 billion in FY 2029.”\n\nLander’s mid-December warning drew little coverage—apart from a New York Post editorial board’s crowing that the looming deficits “will surely dent Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s freebie-filled socialist agenda.” But the mayor’s dramatic tale of his predecessor’s fiscal fiddling was designed with a clear political agenda in mind: both to underline the magnitude of the problem and to identify the villains responsible for this perfidy. “In the words of the Jackson 5, ‘it’s as easy as ABC,’” said the mayor, reprising a tune from his interview earlier in the week with ABC’s Jonathan Karl. “This is an Adams Budget Crisis.”\n\nI’ll leave it to younger Nation readers to decide whether our code-switching mayor’s allusion was designed, as Gothamist suggested, to appeal to the aging boomers “most likely to care deeply about the details behind a major financial issue” or a callout to the TV network getting an early look at his next moves. In any event, as Mamdani stood in the Blue Room on Wednesday—his third formal press conference in as many days—flanked by First Deputy Mayor Dean Fuleihan and Budget Director Sherif Soliman, the scale of the problem was crystal clear. Accusing Eric Adams of having “underestimated known expenses” so he could claim that the city’s budget would balance—as it is required to by law—the mayor explained that “these are not differences of opinion between accountants. They are measured to the tune of more than $7 billion beyond what he published.”\n\n“This is not just bad governance,” Mamdani continued. “It is negligence,” adding that “once we looked under the hood [of the city’s finances], the full picture was staggering.”\n\nNor was Adams the only culprit. Using charts and graphs to detail what he called a 10-year period during which the state “extracted our city’s resources,” Mamdani broke his self-imposed ban on uttering Andrew Cuomo’s name. “In fiscal year 2022 alone, the city sent $68.8 billion to Albany and got back $47.6 billion,” Mamdani said. Blaming his former rival for this “$21 billion chasm” constricting what New York City can spend on services for its citizens, the mayor described Albany’s approach as “punishment.”\n\n“New York City is facing a massive fiscal crisis,” declared the mayor. Addressing it would require “recalibrating the broken fiscal relationship between the state and the city.”\n\nBut when reporters pressed him for details on what that recalibration might look like—or, given Governor Kathy Hochul’s declared opposition to raising taxes (especially while she’s running for reelection)—the mayor declined to go beyond citing what he described as “encouraging” conversations with the governor and legislative leaders in Albany.\n\nNor would the mayor provide specifics on which city programs he’s prepared to sacrifice—however reluctantly—though some of these prospective cuts will doubtless be leaked between now and February 17, when the city will release its preliminary budget.\n\nStill, for a mayor and an administration that has spent the first half of this week celebrating their largely successful navigation of the city’s worst snowstorm and cold spell in years, it was a sharp change in tone. Keeping the streets plowed isn’t exactly rocket science. But it is a challenge that some of Mamdani’s predecessors have notably—and publicly—failed to meet. And as the political scientist Christina Greer recently noted, “if you can’t clear the bar that is the baseline, then I think we know where we are.”\n\nMamdani promised an urban renaissance. And though the magnitude of the city’s fiscal difficulties may have come as a surprise to him, it shouldn’t have. Because Andrew Cuomo wasn’t the only governor bleeding the city to fund Albany’s priorities. It was Kathy Hochul who decided to retain the Enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage funds that the city uses to offset its share of Medicaid costs. She also raised the city’s contribution to mass transit costs by more than half a billion dollars a year, and held back—you might even say “extracted”—a hefty percentage of the city’s share of education funding, while also leaving New Yorkers on the hook to pay for more charter schools. Yet Hochul’s name never figured in Mamdani’s indictment.\n\nBut they say you catch more flies with honey than vinegar, and if Mamdani is going to have any hope of sweet-talking the governor into letting him raise the billions required to plug the budget gap by actually fulfilling his campaign pledge of increasing taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers, he’ll need to deploy all of his considerable stores of charm. Asked several times on Wednesday what would happen if he can’t get that permission, the mayor repeatedly failed to answer.\n\nEric Blanc, Wes McEnany, and Claire Sandberg\n\nWhich was also smart politics. Taking a small victory lap on Monday, Mamdani declared that “our city is up and running, thanks to the plans we put in place and the countless city workers who delivered on them.” Like this week’s big snow, the big hole in the city’s budget came with plenty of warning. In the weeks to come, we’ll find out whether here, too, City Hall has a plan in place to ride out the storm.",

Forecasters emphasize that the exact track of the storm remains uncertain. Even a shift of 50 to 100 miles could change precipitation types, snowfall totals or whether some areas see little to no snow at all.\n\nForecast guidance suggests snow could begin as early as Friday night in parts of the Southeast before spreading north.\n\nThe setup includes very cold air already in place across the Northeast, combined with a developing coastal storm that could pull moisture northward. Woods notes that temperatures will trend colder over the next several days, not warmer.\n\n\"We’ve got more shots of Arctic air coming through,\" he said. \"That’s why temperatures are actually going down instead of up.\"\n\nWind chill advisories are already in effect across parts of the region, with feels-like temperatures dipping below zero in some areas.\n\nFOX Weather says the developing storm has a strong likelihood of rapidly intensifying, a process known as \"bombing out,\" which could turn it into a bomb cyclone. Forecast models suggest the storm’s central pressure could drop dramatically as it moves offshore, a sign of rapid strengthening.\n\nHowever, where that intensification occurs remains uncertain. Meteorologists stress that the storm is still several days away, and multiple scenarios remain on the table.\n\nA bomb cyclone forms through a process called bombogenesis, which occurs when a storm’s central pressure drops at least 24 millibars in 24 hours, according to FOX Weather.\n\nForecasters say a pronounced dip in the jet stream is reinforcing cold air across much of the eastern United States while steering the storm farther south before it turns north.\n\nA strong upper-level disturbance is expected to become embedded in the jet stream late this week, helping trigger the development of low pressure off the East Coast.\n\nWith cold air already in place, that combination raises the risk for snow if the storm moves close enough to the region.\n\nMeteorologists say updates over the next several days will be critical in determining the storm’s impact on New York City and the surrounding area.\n\nThe biggest question remains the storm’s path after it moves through the Carolinas, with forecast models split on whether it will track far enough north to bring another weekend snow to the Northeast.\n\nWednesday: Bitterly cold but dry. Arctic air remains in place with sunshine and strong wind chills making it feel well below freezing across the tri-state area.\n\nThursday: Continued cold with increasing clouds. No precipitation expected, but the cold air sets the stage for potential weekend impacts.\n\nFriday: Clouds increase as a coastal storm begins to organize off the Southeast coast. Snow develops across parts of the Carolinas and southern Virginia by Friday night. Conditions remain cold locally with precipitation still uncertain for NYC.\n\nSaturday: Storm system moves north along the East Coast. Snow is possible in parts of New Jersey, Long Island and coastal areas, depending on the storm’s track. New York City remains in a \"wait-and-see\" zone.\n\nSunday: Potential for lingering snow, wind and cold if the storm tracks closer to the coast. A farther offshore track would limit impacts, while a closer path could bring a nor’easter with strong winds and accumulating snow.\n\nStay ahead of the snow with FOX 5’s expert meteorologists, streaming LIVE on FOX LOCAL.

    "fullText": "HOUSTON (AP) — Winter's brutal grip on the U.S. East is not letting up, with coming days bringing subfreezing temperatures that will plunge deep into what had been a toasty Florida peninsula and a powerful blizzard forecast that may strike the Atlantic coast.\n\nDeep cold is forecast to stick around at least into the first week of February. Meteorologists are also watching what could become a “ bomb cyclone ” — a quickly intensifying storm that’s a winter version of a hurricane — forming off the Carolinas Friday night into Saturday.\n\n“A major winter storm appears to be coming to the Carolinas,” said meteorologist Peter Mullinax of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Weather Prediction Center.\n\nThat storm could dump snow — at least 6 inches (15 centimeters) with white-out conditions — in the Carolinas, northern Georgia and southern Virginia. After that, it could turn and plow through the Interstate 95 corridor late Saturday into Sunday to dump loads more snow from Washington to Boston, further paralyzing much of the country. Or it could deliver a glancing blow, mostly striking places like Cape Cod.\n\nAlternatively, it could just veer off harmlessly to sea. Meteorologists and forecast models aren't yet settling on a single outcome.\n\n“The confidence is much higher that in the coastal Carolinas and Virginia that there will be significant snowfall this weekend,” said James Belanger, vice president for meteorology at the Weather Channel and its parent company. \"The real question is going to be the trajectory it takes” from there.\n\nPrivate meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former NOAA chief scientist, said for the mid-Atlantic and north it's a “boom or bust” situation. “If it happens (to go along the coast) it's going to be a big-time event.\"\n\nModels still disagree on storm track\n\nOn Tuesday forecast models were all over the place, from out to sea to inward toward Philadelphia. By Wednesday morning they started to agree that “we’re likely to see some form of a powerful coastal storm somewhere east of North Carolina, off the Delmarva coast, but they still disagree as to where,” Mullinax said.\n\nChances of the storm veering away from the East Coast entirely had diminished Wednesday morning, but hadn't disappeared altogether, Mullinax said.\n\nOf all the options, “from D.C. up to New York is probably the most unclear,” Mullinax said. He said a mere 50-mile (80-kilometer) difference in the storm's center will be critical. AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Pydynowski said it may be hard for the southern mid-Atlantic to avoid some kind of snow, whether a little or a lot.\n\nThis storm will blow harder than the last one\n\nThis weekend's storm will differ from the previous storm, which started with moist air from the Pacific that combined with a deep plunge of Arctic air from an elongated polar vortex supplemented by more moisture from the south and east, meteorologists said. The last storm had little wind. This one will generate high winds, even if the snow misses the Washington area, generating gusts that could still reach 40 mph (65 kph), plunging wind chills near subzero Fahrenheit (minus 18 Celsius), Mullinax said.\n\n“It looks like a pretty strong and explosive storm so everybody is going to have some gusty winds,\" Pydynowski said, even inland places that won't come close to getting snow like Pittsburgh. Strong winds may take daytime temperatures in the teens there down to feeling like they are below zero, he said.\n\n“This is what we'd consider more of a classic nor'easter,” Belanger said, describing a storm forming around the U.S. Gulf Coast crossing into the Atlantic and going up that coast.\n\nFrigid air and warm water combine to make strong storm\n\nIn this case, one key is warmer-than-normal water in the Gulf of Mexico — partly from human-caused climate change — and the always toasty Atlantic Gulf Stream, said Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist for the nonprofit Climate Central.\n\nWhen that happens the storm “pulls in more moisture and it gives it more strength,” she said.\n\nOnce the core of the storm nears the Carolinas its pressure will drop tremendously, enough to qualify for what meteorologists call “bombogenesis” or “a bomb cyclone,” That will give it the effect of a moderate-strength hurricane, including huge winds, but in the winter, Maue and Belanger said.\n\nIf the storm does come ashore, those winds and extra snow could cause massive snow drifts big enough to bury cars, Maue said.\n\nArctic chill sticks around and goes further south\n\nWhat is more certain is that the Arctic chill in the Midwest and East will continue through mid-February, with only slight warmups that would still be below normal, meteorologists said.\n\nAnd this new weekend storm “is going to take that cold and it's going to spill right down the heart of the Florida peninsula,\" Pydynowski said. Orlando is forecast to go well below freezing and only have a high of 48 F (9 C), smashing temperature records, while even Miami and Key West will flirt with record cold Sunday and Monday, meteorologists said.\n\nThe outlook for Florida was cold enough to raise concerns about damage to the state’s citrus and strawberries.\n\n“We're going into a brutally cold period,” Maue said.\n\nAfter this weekend storm, long-range models see another one at the end of the first week of February, Maue said. Meteorologists see the East stuck in a pattern of bitter cold and snowstorms because of the plunging Arctic air and warm water.\n\nEast Coast snowstorms don't happen too often, but “when it happens, it happens in bunches,\" said former National Weather Service director Louis Uccellini, who has written meteorology textbooks on winter snowstorms.\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

During winter, the polar jet stream transports cold, Arctic air southward across the plains of Canada and the United States, then eastward toward the Atlantic Ocean where warm air from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic tries to move northward.\n\nThe warm waters of the Gulf Stream help keep the coastal waters relatively mild during the winter, which in turn helps warm the cold winter air over the water. This difference in temperature between the warm air over the water and cold Arctic air over the land is the fuel that feeds nor'easters.\n\nSome well-known nor'easters include the New England blizzard of February 1978, the March 1993 \"Superstorm\" and the Boston snowstorms of January and February 2015, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",

    "fullText": "It may not be the news anyone except ski resorts might want to hear, but certain parts of the East Coast could be looking at another load of wintry precipitation by the weekend, in addition to the snow, ice and extreme cold that will already be gripping much of the country.\n\nA variety of weather models show the possibility of a storm on the weekend of Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, said Allison Santorelli, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nGiven the cold temperatures that will already be in place, a developing low pressure system along the coast could bring more snow, sleet or rain to places that experienced the winter storm that cleared out on Jan. 26, Santorelli said.\n\nMore than 20 inches of snow and sleet fell along the coast in the massive winter storm that caused more than a million power outages. A blast of arctic air moved in behind the storm, sending temperatures plummeting downward in a swath that will extend again from Texas to Maine and as far south as Central Florida.\n\n\"Right now it's impossible to determine where the storm will set up, where the precipitation could fall and what kind of precipitation it might be,\" Santorelli said. \"There's a lot of uncertainty on where it tracks and how much precipitation parts of the East might get.\"\n\nEarly indications from the models indicate portions of the Gulf Coast and East Coast could begin experiencing some effects of the next storm as soon as Friday, Jan. 30, according to forecasters at AccuWeather, a private weather company.\n\n\"How fast the storm strengthens will be a determining factor in the final track of the storm this weekend and whether or not it moves up the East Coast,\" said Paul Pasterok, AccuWeather's long range outlook expert.\n\nRain is most likely south of Interstate 10 from Louisiana to Florida, and snow could mix in to the north across parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, AccuWeather predicted.

He watched a nearly 230-pound robot clear his long New Jersey driveway, documenting the process in a video posted to his X account.\n\nWinter Storm Fern has descended upon NJ this morning and my @yarboglobal autonomous snow blower went into action. \nThis is going to be a great test to see if this robot can handle a 6,000 sq.ft. driveway during a major winter storm. \nI'm inside sipping a coffee while it's doing… pic.twitter.com/52DuOGUc9a\n\nMoloughney is a certified techie, host of the State of Charge YouTube channel and a senior editor at InsideEVs. He's been reviewing a $4,999 autonomous snow blower from robotics company Yarbo.\n\nThe storm dumped about six inches of snow in Moloughney's town over 24 hours, according to the National Weather Service. It was the perfect opportunity to give the bot a whirl.\n\n\"This is going to be a great test to see if this robot can handle a 6,000 sq.ft. driveway during a major winter storm,\" Moloughney wrote on X. \"I'm inside sipping a coffee while it's doing its job and so far so good!\"\n\nVideos Moloughney posted during the storm showed the Wi-Fi-connected machine clearing snow from his long driveway, a walkway, and the curved area in front of his two-car garage. When its battery ran low, the robot returned on its own to a charging pad, recharging for about an hour and a half before heading back out into the freezing temperatures.\n\nAccording to Yarbo's website, the autonomous snowblower can clear snow up to 12 feet of snow, throw it as far as 40 feet, and operate in temperatures as low as minus 13 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\"It will continue to do that until the driveway is completely done twice,\" Moloughney updated viewers on X during the storm. \"I'll then send it out again and continue to do so until the snow stops.\"\n\nAutonomous Snow Blower Update:\nThe @yarboglobal completed the first pass of the driveway and went back to the charging dock. \nAfter about 1.25hrs, it will be 80% charged and will automatically return and continue to clear the driveway. \nI plan to run it during the entirety of the… pic.twitter.com/JiP8JGZ93t\n\nStill, the robotic helper hasn't been flawless, according to Moloughney. The reviewer said the machine required extensive digital setup before the storm and struggled to establish GPS connectivity in parts of his driveway. During a previous storm, he said hail fell before the snow, leaving a sheet of ice the robot couldn't remove. And, during a previous storm, hail fell before the snow, leaving a sheet of ice covering his driveway before the bot cleared the snow.\n\nMoloughney and Yarbo did not respond to Business Insider's requests for comment.\n\nDespite the hiccups, Moloughney said the robot worked through the night as the final flakes fell, calling its performance \"kicking ass.\"\n\nYou can watch the reviewer's unboxing of the robo-snow blower in the video below.",

    "fullText": "(Francis Chung/POLITICO via AP Images)\n\nGov. Andy Beshear (D-KY) had a laugh at Sen. Ted Cruz’s (R-TX) expense over a fake X post accusing the governor of being out of town during the massive winter storm that brought dangerous amounts of snow and ice to many parts of the U.S.\n\nCruz posted a “thinking” emoji along with a retweet of a post by the Kentucky Freedom Coalition showing Beshear and his wife posing in front of a church in Europe.\n\nThe account, that’s also followed by Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) posted, “The liberal media went wild when Ted Cruz wasn’t in Texas for the major freeze a few years back. Well, Kentucky is in a declared emergency and @AndyBeshearKYis touring Europe. The media won’t say a word though.”\n\n— Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) January 25, 2026\n\nBeshear responded, “Sorry for missing this earlier, @tedcruz. Been busy leading my state’s emergency response all day. From Kentucky.”\n\nSorry for missing this earlier, @tedcruz. Been busy leading my state's emergency response all day. From Kentucky. https://t.co/v71K8NvjkS\n\n— Andy Beshear (@AndyBeshearKY) January 25, 2026\n\nWashington Post reporter Aaron Blake added some additional context, writing, “This photo of Beshear in Europe is a full week old. He gave a briefing in Kentucky today.”\n\nAccording to WKYT, Beshear spent last week in Europe “with a delegation from Team Kentucky, attending the World Economic Forum and meeting with company leaders in Finland, Sweden, and Switzerland.”\n\nCruz famously received massive backlash in 2021 after escaping to sunny Cancun as a brutal winter storm left millions of his constituents “stranded in sub-freezing temperatures without electricity and water,” according to The Hill.\n\nThe contrite senator returned to Texas within 24-hours of being spotted on his travels. Cruz eventually apologized, saying, “It was obviously a mistake, and in hindsight, I wouldn’t have done it.”\n\nThis week, as Texas braced once again for an onslaught of weather, a Texas political strategist posted, “Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was spotted earlier today, January 20, 2026, on a plane heading to Laguna Beach as the state of Texas braces for a rare ice threat and arctic cold front.”\n\nOf the California trip, a Cruz spokesperson told KXAN that the work trip “was scheduled weeks in advance.”\n\nThe spokesperson continued, “He will be back in Texas before the storm is projected to hit.”\n\nSenator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was spotted earlier today, January 20, 2026, on a plane heading to Laguna Beach as the state of Texas braces for a rare ice threat and arctic cold front. pic.twitter.com/lVTcqP8LR4\n\n— Shea Jordan Smith (@shea_jordan) January 21, 2026\n\nCruz posted that he did, in fact, return to Texas the day before the storm hit.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Cruz has been called out for retweeting a fake post. In 2023, Cruz shared an image of what looked like a shark swimming on a flooded highway in Los Angeles.\n\nThe post Kentucky Gov Clowns Ted Cruz for Getting Duped By European Pic: ‘Sorry For Missing This… Been Busy Leading My State’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "According to scientists at the National Ice Center, Lake Erie is around 80% frozen over. The remaining percentage should be covered in upcoming storm.",
    "fullText": "In late January, Lake Erie has the most ice coverage out of all the Great Lakes.\n\nThe U.S. National Ice Center, which provides mariners and naval forces operating in polar, subpolar and Great Lakes regions with snow, lake-ice products and forecasts, reported a recent and rapid ice growth covering Lake Erie.\n\nLake Erie is near 80% coverage as of Jan. 23, according to the National Ice Center, and coverage is expected to increase over the coming days with the upcoming forecast. Lake Erie has greater ice coverage than the other four Great Lakes.\n\nHowever, the National Ice Center says that Lake Erie usually has the greatest maximum coverage each year since it’s shallow compared to the other Great Lakes.\n\nWeather calculations: So you're freezing? Forgive the Pa. explorer who invented wind chill\n\nOn the Erie side of Lake Erie, employees at East End Angler Bait Shop at 4702 East Lake Road report that the ice on Misery Bay and Horseshoe Pond is 7 to 9 inches thick.\n\nAccording to the National Ice Center, the thickest ice is in the western basin, west of Point Pelee near Canada.\n\nIce in this region is consistently 4 to 6 inches thick, with some areas of greater thickness.\n\nThe ice near the east basin in Cleveland is newer and thinner, with a thickness of 2 inches or less.\n\nRecently, cold temperatures have allowed for some new ice formation.\n\nThe 80% coverage was a large uptick in the month of January. Around Jan. 13, the ice coverage was only reported as a few percent with a little ice located near Point Pelee.\n\nScientists with the National Ice Center say that just select portions of the Lake Erie are left unfrozen.\n\n“Just portions of the southeastern shore and a couple areas toward the west of Long Point,” said Jonathan Edwards-Opperman, physical scientist with the U.S. National Ice Center. “However, these should freeze over in the next few days.”\n\nThere is a silver lining in the upcoming cold temperatures and snow storm. Once Lake Erie fully freezes over, the lake effect snow stops.\n\n“The ice acts as a lid, cutting off the moisture source for the lake-effect snow,” Edwards-Opperman said.\n\nA graphic provided by weather.gov shows the following:\n\nLess than 2 inches of ice is never safe to walk on;\n\n4 inches of ice can support ice fishing and walking;\n\n5 inches of ice can support small groups ice skating;\n\n6 inches of ice can support snow mobiles and ATVs;\n\n9 inches of ice can support cars;\n\nand 12 inches or more of ice can support medium size trucks.\n\nIt’s important to note that ice on the lake is never 100% safe.\n\nBelow zero: Bundle up when revisiting the coldest days in Erie County history\n\n“In addition to the information on the graphic, I would add that whenever there are strong winds, especially when blowing offshore onto the lake, there is an enhanced risk for breakup of shore fast ice under the wind stress,” Edwards-Opperman said.\n\nNicholas Sorensen can be contacted at Nsorensen@usatodayco.com.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Erie Times-News: Lake Erie is nearly frozen over.

Ted Cruz traveled to Cancun in 2021 as a winter storm caused extended outages across the state.\n\nCruz was seen this week leaving Texas as reports of the winter storm's intensity grew.\n\nCruz returned to Texas Friday.

Chief of Emergency Services Scott Forster will oversee and coordinate the response,\" Jenkins' office said. \"Chief of Staff Lauren Trimble is empowered to sign orders, but the Governor's order makes that unnecessary.\"\n\nInformation in this story came from viewer photos and an email from Dallas County.",

Ice accumulations of a few tenths of an inch can make roads slick, and local power outages are possible where ice burdens trees and lines. If accumulations are lower, an icy glaze would be the main issue.\n\nHouston TranStar is reporting the following icy roadway locations:\n\nThe Texas Department of Transportation has a map that shows icy road locations and other hazards.\n\nMonitor local weather broadcasts and check the latest conditions from the National Weather Service before hitting the road. To monitor real-time road conditions in your area, visit Drive Texas or check specific traffic updates for Houston (or via Houston TranStar), or call (800) 452-9292.\n\nIf you must drive in inclement weather, allow additional time to reach your destination and share your travel plans with a friend or family member, so someone knows the route you’re taking.\n\nWhen driving on icy roads, drive slowly and increase the distance between your vehicle and others when stopping. Do not use cruise control during poor driving conditions and ensure your vehicle has a full tank of gas before you head out.\n\nSafety officials tell Texans to be aware and approach bridges and overpasses slowly as ice can accumulate before drivers are able to see it on the roads. Drivers should also watch for downed trees and power lines. If a stoplight is out, treat the intersection as a four-way stop.\n\nSafety officials ask Texans to keep a well-stocked emergency kit with warm clothes, food, water, cell phone battery/charger and first aid items.\n\nFind more tips in this driving safety guide.\n\nWith severe winter weather on the way this weekend, you should have a way to get important updates if the power goes out.\n\nThe FOX LOCAL app will allow you to stay up to date with livestreams, the latest forecasts, news stories and weather alerts in real time, all from your mobile phone or tablet.\n\nYou can also \n\nSeveral Houston-area school districts have opted to stay closed on Monday.

    "fullText": "A massive winter storm is battering the US this weekend, bringing heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain to millions of Americans.\n\nThe storm, which is set to stretch over 2,000 miles from New Mexico to Maine, hit the south-central US on Friday night and has since been making its way eastward.\n\nWhile the weather system is expected to push into the Northeast later on Sunday, parts of the mid-Atlantic have already seen several inches of snow on Sunday morning.\n\nAs snowfall picked up in New York City, mayor Zohran Mamdani announced schools would operate remotely on Monday due to the weather.\n\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul had previously announced that \"all state employees\" were also authorized to work remotely to start the week.\n\n\"I encourage other employers to do the same, just to keep people off the roads and think about this,\" she said.\n\nHere's where else the storm is set to hit.\n\nHeavy snow is continuing to fall across large parts of the US on Sunday morning, but it is expected to concentrate in eastern regions by the evening.\n\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) has predicted that more than 12 inches could fall from the Ohio Valley through the northern mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Sunday, with almost double that possible in parts of New England and the inner Northeast.\n\nThe agency said power outages, tree damage, and dangerous travel conditions are also likely across parts of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic as a result of freezing rains and lingering icing.\n\nMajor cities in the weather system's path include Atlanta, Charlotte, Richmond, Washington, DC, Baltimore, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston.\n\nSome of the worst hit states so far include Arkansas, where some areas recorded around seven inches of snowfall through Friday night into Saturday.\n\nThe NWS said the state had so far experienced \"wave one\" of the storm, with a second wave due to hit overnight into Sunday.\n\nOklahoma, which saw several inches of snow on Friday night, was also bracing for a second round of snow into Sunday.\n\nSpeaking to Fox News on Saturday, Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt said the state could deal with the snow and that he was more concerned with power outages.\n\nMore than 800,000 customers from New Mexico to Virginia are without power as of Sunday morning, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMoving forward, the NWS said heavy snowfall is likely to lead to \"widespread travel disruptions and closures\" that could last a number of days.\n\nTravel has already been hit hard this weekend, with airlines canceling thousands of flights across Saturday and Sunday.\n\nCharlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International are the worst affected airports on Sunday, per flight-tracking site FlightAware.\n\nMany airlines are waiving rebooking fees for flights to and from affected regions.",

    "fullText": "An ice storm warning is in place for Knoxville and parts of East Tennessee.\n\nWhile the rest of the Volunteer State is under a winter storm warning, East Tennessee is bracing for crippling ice.\n\nThe ice storm warning runs from 1 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 24, through 7 p.m. Sunday, Jan. 25, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nIt is in place for the following counties: Anderson, Bledsoe, Bradley, Cherokee, Clay, Hamilton, Jefferson, Knox, Loudon, Marion, McMinn, Meigs, Rhea, Roane and Sequatchie.\n\nNortheast Tennessee has a winter storm warning for the following counties: Campbell, Claiborne, Grainger, Hamblen, Hancock, Hawkins, Morgan, Scott, Sullivan and Union.\n\nHere's what to know about the warnings and how to stay safe.\n\nAn ice storm warning is issued when an area may receive a quarter-inch or more of ice accumulation, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n\"Travel is strongly discouraged. If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency. Prepare for possible power outages,\" the weather service warned.\n\nA winter weather advisory has been issued for the Great Smoky Mountains, where mixed precipitation of snow and sleet is expected.\n\nThe warning is in effect from 1 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 24, to 7 p.m. Sunday, Jan. 25.\n\n\"Power outages and tree damage are possible due to the ice. Travel will be hazardous. Gusty winds could bring down tree branches,\" the weather service warned.\n\nThe mountaintops have a high wind warning from 7 p.m. Saturday to 7 p.m. Sunday. Widespread power outages are expected.\n\nA winter storm watch indicates severe weather is on the way. The watch will be issued at least 24 hours before a storm that has a risk of being hazardous, according to the National Weather Service. The storm's occurrence, location or timing may be uncertain under a watch.\n\nA watch will normally be upgraded to either a warning or an advisory, depending on how a storm develops.\n\nA winter storm warning means that a storm is imminent. Warnings are issued for a significant winter weather event, including snow, ice, sleet or blowing snow ‒ or a combination of these hazards, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nIf a winter storm warning is issued, it's best to stay off the roads.\n\nA winter storm advisory means the storm is happening, but the winter weather storm dangers are limited. Be prepared for winter driving conditions and possible travel difficulties. Use caution when driving.\n\nThere are things that you can do to prepare yourself, your car and your home for the upcoming winter weather.\n\nMake sure that you have food, extra water and warm clothes ahead of a storm in case the ice or snow causes a power outage, according to the Red Cross. It's also helpful to have a snow shovel and salt on hand for your driveway and sidewalks.\n\nAlso, consider filling up your car with gas before a snowstorm. Keep a blanket, an emergency kit and warm clothes in your car in case you get stuck on the side of the road, according to the Red Cross.\n\nThere's still much uncertainty about the details of the expected winter storm this weekend. Regardless, now is the time to start preparing. pic.twitter.com/CwDRlQLVXV\n\n— NWS Morristown (@NWSMorristown) January 21, 2026\n\nAllison Kiehl covers trending and breaking news from Knoxville for the Tennessee Connect Team.

    "description": "American Airlines and JetBlue are making it free to rebook flights ahead of a major winter storm.",
    "fullText": "Major airlines are making it free to change your flights ahead of a dangerous winter storm.\n\nSouthwest Airlines, American Airlines, United Airlines, and JetBlue are waiving rebooking fees for flights to and from affected regions this weekend.\n\nIf your travel plans this weekend include major cities such as Dallas, Austin, Oklahoma City, Nashville, Atlanta, Charlotte, Washington, DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston, you may want to contact your airline to avoid prolonged delays or cancellations at the airport. The National Weather Service is warning that more than 230 million Americans will be affected, from the Southwest to New England.\n\nEven if you won't change your plans, your flight may still get canceled. Delta Air Lines said Thursday it is canceling flights at airports in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Tennessee, citing safety concerns caused by heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain. The airline will also be bringing in cold-weather specialists.\n\nAs of Thursday evening, based on the Misery Map, which tracks real-time flight disruptions, there hasn't been a spike in delays or cancellations.\n\nBased on recent storms, such as the one that hit over Thanksgiving and coincided with the end of the government shutdown, mass cancellations may be inevitable. So it's good to know your passenger rights and your options when things don't go according to plan.\n\nIf your flight is canceled and you choose not to rebook, the airline is legally required to provide you with a cash refund — not a voucher or credit.\n\nHowever, things are different for delays. The Trump Administration recently killed a proposal that would have required airlines to compensate passengers for long delays, so flyers largely have to rely on airline goodwill or their credit cards to get anything for the inconvenience.\n\nSome airlines have committed to providing accommodations, transportation, and food during a controllable overnight delay or cancellation, as outlined in the Airline Customer Service Dashboard.\n\nControllable disruptions include issues such as maintenance or crew staffing. Frontier Airlines is the only carrier that does not offer accommodations in the event of a controllable overnight delay or cancellation, but it will provide a meal voucher.\n\nIt still doesn't hurt to ask for a meal or hotel voucher when a non-controllable issue arises, such as the weather. The worst they can say is no.\n\nDuring disruptions, airlines often allow you to make changes via their mobile app or website, rather than waiting on clogged phone lines or in long customer service lines.\n\nIf this isn't an option, try an online chat. Carriers like Delta Air Lines allow you to text a representative for help.\n\nYou can put yourself in the virtual queue and wait in line at the airport, potentially upping your chances of speaking with an agent sooner.\n\nHere are the phone numbers for each airline:\n\nTravel credit cards, such as the Chase Sapphire Reserve and the American Express Platinum, offer built-in insurance that reimburses travelers for hotel, meal, and transportation expenses incurred due to certain flight disruptions.\n\nThe weather is typically covered. For this to work, the traveler would have needed to book their flight with that travel card.\n\nIf your credit card doesn't offer travel insurance, it may be worthwhile to purchase a separate trip insurance policy before traveling. This type of insurance can help reimburse costs you might lose due to flight problems, such as prepaid hotel stays or cruise bookings.\n\nHowever, you must purchase this insurance before any travel disruptions occur — once you know a flight might be affected, it's likely too late.",

    "title": "How to Survive a Massive Winter Storm",
    "description": "Rule number one: stay inside.",
    "fullText": "With a historically bad winter storm expected to bring snow, ice, and sub-zero wind chills to many parts of the United States this weekend, it's a good time to make sure you're prepared for a potentially life-threatening disaster.\n\nWhile winter storms are generally less deadly than hurricanes and heat waves, they can be extremely dangerous, particularly when extremely cold, wind, and ice storms cause power outages. But with a little preparation and common sense, you should be all right when it gets extra snowy and cold. Here are some tips and instructions for blizzard and winter storm survival.\n\nThe map above, from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Weather Prediction Center shows the predicted course of the storm through Jan. 26. You can click the link to dig into predicted snow amounts, ice accumulation, and more, but the overall picture is a huge storm that is likely to affect more than 172 million people in the U.S. and bring record low temperatures. If you're anywhere in the affected area, take time to plan for a potential snow-and-cold disaster before it happens.\n\nFor a winter storm, you want to prepare for a few cold days without power. You should have a basic survival bag tucked away in an easy-to-access spot in your house for any disaster. According to the government, a boilerplate emergency kit will contain:\n\nWater and non-perishable food for several days\n\nExtra cell phone battery or charger\n\nBattery-powered or hand crank radio that can receive NOAA Weather Radio tone alerts and extra batteries\n\nDust mask to help filter contaminated air, and plastic sheeting and duct tape to shelter in place\n\nMoist towelettes, garbage bags, and plastic ties for personal sanitation\n\nNon-sparking wrench or pliers to turn off utilities\n\nCan opener (if your kit contains canned food)\n\nExtra clothing and blankets (although I bet you already know where these are in your home)\n\nFor winter storm saftey, I'd add a carbon monoxide detector, just to be as safe as possible when shut up inside your house. Here’s a handy shopping list you can take to the supermarket, complete with “extra credit” items like prescriptions medicine and games to keep you busy.\n\nIf you only follow one rule for blizzard survival, make it this one: Do not be outside during a winter storm. If you’re home, you probably won’t be snowbound for more than a week (and even that is unlikely), and you’ll be much warmer than if you were outside.\n\nIf you are home during a blizzard or winter storm (and you should be) take the following steps:\n\nDon’t forget your pets. Bring them inside, too.\n\nBe able to access multiple sources of information about the weather, from the internet, to television, to radio, and make sure you can get updates even if the power goes out.\n\nIf you have electric heat, crank it up as the storm approaches in case you lose power.\n\nStay in a small, insulated area: To conserve heat, stay in one room as much as possible.\n\nStuff towels and rags under doors to conserve heat.\n\nBe careful with alternative heaters like kerosene. They can start a fire, and if not properly ventilated, you can die from carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nCover windows at night but uncover them during day to catch any heat from sunlight.\n\nSave batteries: Use your phone to check in on friends, family and neighbors by or to call authorities only.\n\nAs cold weather approaches, you may hear difference kinds of buzzwords for approaching storms on your NOAA weather radio and from other sources. Here’s a crash course on the relevant winter weather warnings from the National Weather Service, and what they mean, with the most severe listed first.\n\nA warning indicates an 80% or greater probability of conditions that pose a threat to life or property, and that travel will become difficult to impossible. In other words: “This storm is serious business.”\n\nBlizzard Warning: A blizzard warning means that the following conditions are occurring or expected within the next 12 to 18 hours: Snow and/or blowing snow reducing visibility to 1/4 mile or less for three hours or longer, and sustained winds of 35 mph or greater or frequent gusts to 35 mph or greater.\n\nWinter Storm Warning: A winter storm warning is issued when a significant combination of hazardous winter weather is occurring or imminent. That means five inches or more of snow/sleet within a 12-hour period or seven inches or more of snow/sleet within a 24-hour period, and/or enough ice accumulation to cause damage to trees or power lines. It also can mean a life-threatening or damaging combination of snow and/or ice accumulation with wind.\n\nWatches are intended to provide enough lead time so you can make plans to stay safe. They are usually issued a day or so before the predicted event when there’s a greater than 50% chance of it happening.\n\nWinter Storm Watch: A winter storm watch is issued when there is the potential for significant and hazardous winter weather within 48 hours. This doesn’t mean that significant and hazardous winter weather will occur—it only means it is possible.\n\nBlizzard Watch: This means conditions are favorable for a blizzard event—low visibility with winds of at least 35 mph.\n\nWinter storm advisories indicate that less serious (but still concerning) weather conditions are possible. Remember, though, a storm can change from one condition to another, so keep checking back. Go to the National Weather Service’s site for more in-depth weather-warning information.\n\nBeing trapped in your car during a snow-mergency is bad, but not necessarily deadly. Here’s a detailed trapped-in-your-car survival guide, but here are the main points:\n\nDon’t panic: As survival scenarios go, being trapped in a car in a snowstorm is not that bad. It definitely beats being trapped in a snowstorm without a car.\n\nMake sure your tailpipe is not clogged: When you first realize you are trapped, check the exhaust pipe to make sure it’s clear. You don’t want to die of carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nIndicate you are in distress to the outside world: Call 911 if you can. Tie a brightly colored cloth or ribbon to your antenna or door. If the snow stops, raise your hood.\n\nStay in your vehicle: A car is an excellent survival shelter—a guy in Sweden survived in his car for two months, and he didn’t even seem to have had food or water. It is a bad idea to go walking around in a blizzard. You will get lost, cold, wet, and maybe even hit by another driver.\n\nBundle up: Wear as many layers as you can with the extra clothing you packed.\n\nCreate as small a space as possible: If you have blankets or jackets, create a little “fort” for yourself. A smaller space is easier to heat. You could try lining the windows with newspaper or those discarded fast food bags you never cleaned up.\n\nRun your car for 10 minutes an hour: Experts recommend starting your car and running the heater, hazard lights, and dome light for about 10 minutes per hour. Roll down the window a crack while the engine is running to avoid the possibility of inhaling carbon monoxide. Other than cold, carbon monoxide is your biggest danger.\n\nDon’t play on your phone: I know it’s boring to sit in the car for so long, but only use your cell to call emergency numbers. Don’t be surprised if the authorities tell you to “sit tight,” though.\n\nIf you run out of water, drink melted snow: You can get a little moisture into your body by drinking melted snow.\n\nSo you didn’t listen when I said to stay home, huh? Now you’re stumbling blindly through a snowstorm and freezing to death. I won’t sugar coat it: things are bad for you, and your survival depends on the severity of the storm. But here’s what to do:\n\nFind shelter: Get out of the wind and snow. Don’t try to make it home or wherever else you’re going if there’s somewhere safe you can wait things out.\n\nCover up your exposed flesh: I imagine this would occur to you anyway, but just in case it doesn’t, cover up as much as possible to stay warm and avoid frostbite.\n\nBuild a shelter: The National Weather Service recommends the following if you can’t find a shelter: “Build a lean-to, windbreak, or snow cave for protection from the wind. Build a fire for heat and to attract attention. Place rocks around the fire to absorb and reflect heat.” I think they’re being very optimistic. During a serious blizzard, like Minnesota’s “Children’s Blizzard” of 1888, people died yards from their houses because they got disoriented and snow-blind, so you’re probably not going to have time to build an igloo or whatever in a real blizzard. But learn wilderness survival tactics if you are likely to be at risk.\n\nMelt snow for water: Melting snow for water is OK, but don’t eat it frozen—that will lower your body temperature.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has completely misunderstood what global warming means in a bonkers post on social media.\n\nThe U.S. is facing a potentially historically cold period, with the eastern two-thirds of the country expected to experience sub-zero temperatures and heavy snowfall, which could cause major disruption. For the president, that is proof enough that “global warming” is a hoax.\n\n“Record Cold Wave expected to hit 40 States,” he said on Truth Social. “Rarely seen anything like it before. Could the Environmental Insurrectionists please explain—WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GLOBAL WARMING???”\n\nIt is not entirely clear who he meant by “Environmental Insurrectionists.”\n\nThe world’s most powerful man has repeatedly shown he is apprehensive about the existence of climate change, championing fossil fuel policies and peddling conspiracy theories, despite an overwhelming body of scientific evidence that it poses a real and imminent threat.\n\nIt has long been public knowledge that the now-relegated term global warming does not mean that cold temperatures will not occur, but rather that the average temperature inside the Earth’s atmosphere will be higher, disrupting delicate environmental balances.\n\nThe term is now instead regarded as merely a part of the wider phenomenon of climate change.\n\nCold landmasses and warm waters in the Arctic are stretching the polar vortex, dragging cold air further south. When that cold air meets warm, moist southern air, it could cause heavy snow, PBS reports.\n\nOn its website, the American Red Cross said, “Winters are getting warmer and shorter because of the climate crisis. But, because a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, heavier snowfalls are more likely to occur,” the Guardian reports.\n\nThe BBC reports that “cities including Memphis, Nashville, Washington DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York,” could be blanketed with snow.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the weather could “pose a life-threatening risk of hypothermia and frostbite to exposed skin.”\n\nThe storm is expected to reach as far west as New Mexico, with around 230 million people staring down the barrel of 20-degree temperatures as state governors declare emergencies across the country.\n\nTrump’s disregard for the environment is well-documented. On his first day back in the Oval Office last year, he gave an executive order called “Putting people over fish,” where he disregarded the endangered delta smelt as “an essentially worthless fish,” and demanded water from their habitat be taken to fight fires hundreds of miles away.\n\nHe has also waged a long-running war on wind turbines, claiming “windmills” are making whales crazy and killing bald eagles, a point he illustrated on social media by posting a picture of a dead falcon in Israel.\n\nIn September, he gave a speech to the United Nations, where he said climate change is the “greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”\n\nDuring the same speech, he said, “I have a little standing order in the White House,” he said. “Never use the word ‘coal’.

    "description": "One thing is certain about Sunday's storm: \"Whatever snow does fall isn't going anywhere fast as a cold airmass remains entrenched over the northeast next week.\"",
    "fullText": "Rhode Island and other parts of Southern New England could see up to 18 inches of snow from a storm starting Sunday and continuing into Monday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nA winter storm watch and a cold weather advisory have been issued, as dangerously cold weather will move into Southern New England ahead of the storm on Friday afternoon, Jan. 23.\n\n\"At the moment the most likely snowfall totals are in the 8-14 inch range,\" the weather service said in its forecast discussion early Friday morning.\n\nThe range could be higher, 12 to 18 inches, for most of Southern New England, the weather service indicated in a graphic posted to social media also early on Friday morning. The weather service predicted those snowfall totals early as part of its \"initial most likely snow accumulation forecast.\"\n\nSetting records: How often does RI get a foot of snow? How this weekend's storm stacks up\n\nIn a social media post, the agency characterized its confidence in the snowfall total forecast as \"medium\" and said, \"Keep in mind, this will be refined/changed as things come into better focus over the next 24-48 hours, so check back!\"\n\nThe 12- to 18-inch snowfall forecast indicated on the graphic is consistent throughout Southern New England, except for Block Island, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, which could get lower totals, 8 to 12 inches, due to the potential for mixed precipitation, the weather service said.\n\nThe snow is most likely to start Sunday morning into early Sunday afternoon, with the heaviest snowfall Sunday evening into early Monday morning, the weather service said. Light to moderate snow will linger during the day Monday, the weather service said.\n\n\"Travel will be difficult, especially Sunday night into Monday morning when accumulation rates will be highest,\" the weather service said.\n\nThe storm will affect millions of Americans as it moves across the central part of the country through the Southeast then into New England, according to forecasters.\n\n\"The system moving out of the plains will direct a plume of deep moisture and warm air into/over top of a dome of subfreezing air associated with a sprawling high pressure over the northeast which will lead to a prolonged period of snowfall, some of it heavy,\" the weather service says in its forecast discussion.\n\nComputer models are showing some \"varying degree of spread\" in the track of the storm, \"which is one factor that would lead us to be cautious in declaring exact snowfall amounts as the track is a factor,\" the weather service said.\n\nIn trying to determine the impact of winter storms, forecasters consider how close it will pass to a benchmark about 80 miles southeast of Nantucket, at 40 degrees north latitude and 70 degrees west longitude.\n\n\"Another related factor\" is a layer of warmer air that could \"lead to a period of mixed precipitation on the south coast overnight, potentially up into the south shore of eastern MA and northern RI,\" the weather service said.\n\n\"Whatever snow does fall isn't going anywhere fast as a cold airmass remains entrenched over the northeast next week (highs in the teens and 20s),\" the forecast discussion said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Providence Journal: RI weather forecast: Snow storm Sunday and Monday could dump 18 inches",

    "fullText": "Politicians call for more infrastructure funding amid anger that county is seen as ‘holiday playground’\n\nAccessed by a steep, winding lane, the tiny settlement of Cucurrian in the far-west of Cornwall feels remote at the best of times. But over the last two weeks, the people who live here have felt even more isolated after they were left without a way of communicating with the outside world as a result of Storm Goretti.\n\n“I think people feel let down, angry, failed,” said Mark Pugh, an audiobook producer, who has spent more hours than he would care to tot up carefully picking his way out of Cucurrian and sitting in his car in a layby to find a mobile signal good enough to work from. “This storm has shown that Cornwall isn’t resilient enough. A lot is promised, but not enough is delivered.”\n\nGoretti brought down thousands of power, phone and broadband lines and caused countless trees to fall, including one that crushed the caravan of 50-year-old James Southey and killed him.\n\nFor days, many hundreds of people were left without power, water or both, but while those services have been restored, communication links in some places remain down a fortnight on. In a world where reliable online connections are needed for everything from health consultations to banking, it makes life very difficult.\n\n“It’s like we’re forgotten,” said Elaine Claxton, 70, an actor, as she pointed to the wires still broken and dangling next to a giant fallen tree on the lane leading to her home in Cucurrian. She has no broadband, no landline and the mobile signal is unreliable at best. Staying in touch with frail family members a few miles away has been fraught.\n\nHer sister, Shelley Claxton, 63, an animal trainer, said places such as Cucurrian were resilient. “When you’re as remote as we are, you have to be, but I think this storm shows us we need to do something different. Nature is whipping up more and more storms and we need to find ways of adapting to that.”\n\nOn the Lizard peninsula, the southernmost point of the British mainland, Sam Kirby, 53, described how the communication breakdown led to difficulties in working as a digital marketing consultant and in her volunteer role as a coastguard rescue officer.\n\nHer old-style copper landline meant the coastguard station officer could – just about – contact her by phone, but without broadband, working was challenging.\n\n“I had to go full digital nomad, which included time working in a supermarket car park with the car heater on, in the library, and basically perching anywhere I could to find wifi,” she said.\n\n“We’re constantly being told by those pushing Cornwall as a place to work that we’ve got to trade nationally or internationally, that we have the best broadband in the country, that we’re a booming digital economy. It’s hard to boom digitally when you can’t even get a text message out.”\n\nKirby and the people of Cucurrian are angry that Openreach, which builds and maintains the UK’s largest broadband network, has not restored services more quickly.\n\nThere is concern that the continuing switch from copper phone lines to full-fibre broadband makes them more vulnerable. “If this happens again next year, we won’t even have the copper landline so won’t have any link out at all,” said Kirby.\n\nIt is not just remote communities that have been hit. Karen Bennett, 72, lives close to Penzance town centre but a pine tree brought down a pole there, cutting off her broadband.\n\nA new pole has been put up but the broadband hasn’t returned, making her work as chair of the twinning association forging links between Penzance and the French town of Concarneau difficult. “We’ve had to find ways of working around it,” she said. “It’s frustrating. We still don’t know when the broadband will be back.”\n\nThese are interesting political and cultural times in Cornwall. The UK government has indicated that it will explore a bespoke devolution deal for Cornwall, possibly giving it more control over transport, housing and economic development.\n\nThis week the Cornish language – Kernewek – was officially recognised under part three of the European charter for regional or minority languages, which gives it greater protection and status.\n\nBut the loss of power, water and the continuing communications issues have made many Cornish people question whether the rest of the UK cares enough about the far-west of Britain, when it is not holidaying or visiting second homes there.\n\nLoveday Jenkin, a leading member of the political party Mebyon Kernow, which campaigns for greater self-government for Cornwall, said Goretti had exposed weaknesses in its infrastructure.\n\n“It shows Cornwall should have more devolved resilience money,” Jenkin said. “People want to treat Cornwall as a holiday playground. They need to recognise that there are people on the ground who have to manage it but don’t have the money.”\n\nJenkin spoke as yet another storm, named Ingrid by the Portuguese national weather service, brought in strong winds and heavy rain on Friday. “I think UK government needs to recognise Cornwall as the canary in the coalmine in relation to climate change,” Jenkin said. “There will be more storms coming.”\n\nOpenreach said it could not put a figure on how many people in Cornwall were still without broadband and rejected the idea that the switch to fibre made the county more vulnerable, arguing the outages were largely down to trees falling on overhead wires or taking down poles, which affected the copper and fibre network.\n\nA spokesperson said: “Storm Goretti has caused the worst impact to our network in Cornwall in recent memory and as soon as it was safe to do so, we’ve had teams of engineers working round the clock to repair the extensive damage.\n\n“We have managed to reconnect thousands of homes and businesses, but there is more to do and we know how frustrating that is. Unfortunately, the reality is that this type of repair work – closing roads, replacing poles and overhead cables – is complex and time-consuming.”\n\nThe recovery will take a long time. Alasdair Moore, the head of estate and gardens on Tresco, one of the Isles of Scilly, which lies 30 miles (48km) off the mainland and was battered by 99mph gusts during Goretti, said the effect was devastating.\n\nTrees fell, houses were damaged and the water supply interrupted. “The scale of the clear-up is huge,” said Moore. “It will be ongoing for a few years but the way the community and the team has responded has been magnificent.”\n\nMoore said remote communities such as those huddled on Scilly and west Cornwall always got on with it and came good. “Dealing with gales is very much part of this place’s history,” he said.",

    "title": "What to Do to Prepare Your House for This Weekend's Historic Winter Storm",
    "description": "You still have time to get ready for the potentially hazardous weather.",
    "fullText": "Ideally, a winter storm is merely uncomfortable and annoying, but they can sometimes be dangerous for you and your home. This weekend, a potentially historic winter storm is bearing down on some 200 million Americans, who may face dangerously icy conditions and significant snowfall. It's important to know your area's risk and understand the meaning and potential impact of different weather terms (advisory, watch, and warning) so you can respond quickly in the event of an emergency. You should also use the next few days to take steps to prepare your home and lower the chances of damage and danger.\n\nWinter prep starts with a thorough inspection of your property, both inside and out and top to bottom. Look for everything from roof leaks to door gaps to clogged gutters—anything that could lead to damage from snow, ice, and freezing temperatures. Make a plan for repairs and winterization to ensure your safety and comfort—not just for the next storm, but for the entire season.\n\nHere's a quick summary of the most important tasks to take care of before the temperatures drop or the snow starts to fall.\n\nThis is something that should be part of your regular home maintenance, and it's especially important when you are using your furnace and fireplace regularly (considering both fire safety and indoor air quality). Follow the Environmental Protection Agency's guidelines for where to install CO detectors and how to inspect and maintain them; then check out the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) guidelines for smoke alarms. Make sure your fire extinguisher is handy and working as well.\n\nAny thermostat will show you indoor temperature, and if you have a smart system like an Ecobee or Nest, you have real-time data at your fingertips. The CDC also recommends installing easy-to-read thermometers in locations where you'll see them frequently. This is especially important for older adults, as our sense of temperature changes as we age, increasing the risk of cold-related health issues.\n\nGaps around doors and windows keep your home drafty, which is uncomfortable and a waste of energy. Door sweeps, weatherstripping, and caulk can be used to fill spaces that allow cold air in. These are simple DIY fixes that go a long way toward lowering your heating bill and keeping your home warm. If your home has older windows, floor-to-ceiling thermal curtains can also help with insulation even if you lose heating.\n\nBefore freezing temperatures arrive, make sure your outdoor plumbing is prepared—frozen pipes can burst, causing significant damage to your home. To winterize exterior faucets, remove and store hoses, shut off outdoor water, drain spigots, close them up, and insulate with covers.\n\nWhile you don't need to fully winterize your indoor plumbing unless your house will be vacant for an extended period of time, you should look for pipes that are uninsulated and in or near unheated spaces and consider applying insulation sleeves or heat tape.\n\nTurn your furnace on and make sure it is working properly. Even if you don't need to heat your home right now, you don't want to scramble to schedule an emergency repair down the line when it's freezing outside. Look for common signs that your unit needs maintenance, such as unusual smells and noises, short cycling, and lack of actual heat. Replace your air filter as well.\n\nYour fireplace or wood stove can provide heat in an emergency. Like your furnace, they need seasonal maintenance to avoid chemical buildup and ensure proper venting, both of which impact your indoor air quality and overall safety. The NFPA recommends annual cleaning, which you can do yourself. However, if it's been awhile since your fireplace was professionally inspected and cleaned, consider scheduling a chimney sweep before you start your first winter fire. You can find one online or ask your local fire department for a recommendation.\n\nIf you get snow in your area, make sure your shovels are accessible and restock your ice melt. If you use a snowblower, give it a thorough inspection, replace any worn or damaged parts, change the oil, top it off with fresh gas, and start it up to make sure it runs.\n\nYou should be prepared for storms during any season with a stock of disaster supplies so you and your family (and pets) can survive without outside aid for a few days if needed. We have a guide to creating an emergency kit if you don't have one already, but you should also check all supplies and replenish anything that has been used or is missing. For winter, be sure you also have sleeping bags, warm blankets, and climate-appropriate changes of clothes and shoes available.",

He will be back in Texas before the storm is projected to hit,” a spokesperson for the senator said in a statement, first shared with KHOU.\n\nMultiple critics invoked another moment from Cruz’s career where he went viral and earned plenty of mockery.

Heavy snowfall and freezing rain are expected to begin Friday, hitting northern Texas and cities like Dallas and Houston. The storm will eventually move its way to the East Coast.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott (R) has declared a state of emergency in his state over the approaching harsh weather.\n\n“Based on current forecasts, the State of Texas is acting to ensure Texans have the resources they need before severe winter weather impacts communities across Texas,” the governor announced this week. “I thank emergency management personnel and first responders for working tirelessly to keep Texans safe.”\n\nThe post Ted Cruz Bites Back at Critics Furious Over His Leaving Texas Ahead of Major Winter Storm first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Dallas will activate its Emergency Operations Center Saturday morning as a winter storm brings freezing temperatures and icy conditions to the region.\n\nCity crews are pre-treating major roads and overpasses, while a massive emergency shelter for up to 900 people will open at Fair Park on Friday.\n\nOfficials urge residents to stay off the roads, protect pipes, and bring pets indoors to avoid accidents and infrastructure damage.\n\nDALLAS - Dallas city leaders on Wednesday announced a comprehensive emergency response plan ahead of a winter storm expected to bring freezing temperatures and icy conditions to the region starting Friday evening.\n\nThe city’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) will activate Saturday at 7 a.m. to coordinate public safety, transportation, and infrastructure recovery efforts.\n\n\"Our focus is simple. We want to keep our residents safe,\" the City Manager told reporters during a multi-departmental news conference. \"Our teams have been closely monitoring forecasts to ensure we activate our winter weather operations plan.\"\n\nTransportation and Public Works Director Gus Concarly said the city is taking a \"three-pronged approach,\" including pre-treating bridges and overpasses with brine and sand. Concarly noted that 50 \"ice force\" vehicles are standing by, but warned that residential streets will not be sanded unless requested by emergency responders.\n\nDallas Water Utilities urged residents to wrap exposed pipes and locate their main water shut-off valves. Meanwhile, sanitation officials warned that while Friday collections should proceed as scheduled, garbage and recycling pickups could see significant delays on Monday and Tuesday if road conditions deteriorate.\n\n\"We are well-prepared. This is what we do,\" Justin Ball, Dallas Fire Chief, said during the news conference. \"If you don't want us to be quite as busy, then stay home. That's the advice. Stay home, because there will be a lot of car accidents.\"\n\nTo protect the city’s unsheltered population, an inclement weather shelter will open at Fair Park’s Grand Building starting at 4 p.m. Friday. Kevin Oden, Director of Emergency Management, said the site can accommodate 800 to 900 people, with backup buildings identified if capacity exceeds 75%.\n\nResidents needing transportation to the shelter can call 311 to be picked up by Dallas Street Response Teams.\n\nFire Chief Justin Ball and police officials urged residents to stay off the roads to prevent accidents. Ball also issued a stern warning regarding home heating safety.\n\n\"Don't start warming fires inside the house... no cooking on the balcony,\" Ball said, reminding residents to open fireplace drafts and avoid using candles or outdoor grills indoors if the power goes out.\n\nDallas Animal Services confirmed they will be patrolling 24/7 to respond to reports of animals left in the cold. Under city ordinances, pet owners are required to bring animals indoors during extreme weather.\n\nReflecting on the deadly 2021 winter storm, city leaders emphasized improved coordination and infrastructure. Officials noted that several recreation centers have since been equipped with emergency generators, allowing them to serve as warming stations where residents can charge phones and stay warm if local power grids fail.\n\n\"We have the systems in place to make sure those communication chains... are intact,\" the City Manager said. \"Planning for events like this does not start today.\"\n\nInformation in this article is from the Dallas city leader's news conference on Wednesday.",

He notes there is often a large gap between model output and actual accumulation.\n\nOn Wednesday, Winter Storm Watches stretched across a large part of the country, with more than 175 million people potentially in the storm’s path.\n\nBarnes also warns that frigid Arctic air trailing the storm could freeze any snow or ice that falls, raising the risk of power outages and potentially disrupting travel for days.\n\nStay ahead of the snow with FOX 5’s expert meteorologists, streaming LIVE on FOX LOCAL.

    "fullText": "A major, widespread winter storm will lash much of the South, Midwest and Northeast on Friday, Jan. 23 through Monday, Jan. 26 with heavy snow likely for tens of millions of people from New Mexico to New England, according to Weather.com.\n\n\"It’s not hyperbole to call this storm a monster,\" said Washington Post meteorologist Ben Noll on X on Jan. 21. \"At its peak on Sunday (Jan. 25), 55 percent of all people in the United States are forecast to simultaneously experience snow, sleet or freezing rain. That’s more than half the population, at the same time,\" he said.\n\nWidespread travel disruptions are likely across the country this weekend, according to AccuWeather. \"Icy and snow-covered roads could force highway closures lasting for hours,\" said Jonathan Porter, AccuWeather chief meteorologist, in an e-mail to USA TODAY.\n\n\"Key east-to-west interstates that are critical for travel, commerce, and deliveries, including Interstates 20, 30, and 40, could experience closures around the same time, compounding challenges for travelers and supply chains.\"\n\nAs for snowfall totals, heavy snow of 6-12 inches is likely in the heart of the Plains, with over 2 feet possible in parts of the Appalachians, AccuWeather said in an online forecast.\n\nHow much snow falls in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast will depend on the storm's exact track, but a significant and plowable amount − likely up to or over a foot − is possible.\n\nThe heaviest snow, potentially up to a foot, is expected across central Oklahoma on Friday, Jan. 23 and Saturday, Jan. 24, according to AccuWeather. Lesser amounts, likely 3-6 inches, will fall in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, New Mexico and Texas.\n\nIn Arkansas, there is a 30-50% chance of exceeding 6 inches of snow over central and northern parts of the state, the weather service said. In Tennessee, the highest probabilities for at least 6 inches of snow favor areas north of Interstate 40, the weather service said.\n\nSnow, sleet and ice could sink even a bit farther south in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, while it picks up in Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, Virginia and parts of the Carolinas, said Weather.com meteorologist Jonathan Erdman in an online forecast.\n\nWintry precipitation will end in Texas, Oklahoma and the lower Mississippi Valley by midday Sunday, Jan. 25, but will persist from the Ohio Valley to the piedmont of Virginia and the Carolinas into the Northeast, according to Weather.com. Some areas of heavy snow are also possible in parts of the Ohio Valley.\n\nThe winter storm \"has the potential to bring widespread heavy snow to the mid-Atlantic and Northeast this weekend,\" according to Weather.com.\n\nMaps posted by Weather.com showed totals of as much as 2-3 feet of snow in southern Virginia, with widespread 1-2 feet across a wide swath of the Mid-Atlantic.\n\n\"Latest model trends show the higher snow totals shifting north into Washington, Baltimore and Philadelphia. The heaviest snow looks to fall Saturday night, Jan. 24 into Sunday, Jan. 25, making travel difficult to impossible. Snow may even linger across New England on Monday Jan. 26, depending on where the storm is positioned,\" Weather.com said.\n\nUpdate 01/21/2026 AM forecast for Winter Storm Fern. This is the forecast at this point and it shifted north some. \n\nPlease understand this forecast will likely change again and for who gets what and how much but understand this will be a huge winter storm and if you live in… pic.twitter.com/kf0pf4jScK\n\n— Charles Peek (@CharlesPeekWX) January 21, 2026\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, \"confidence is high that a significant storm will occur, but not on specific details for the storm track, timing and precipitation amounts. Start preparations now for an impactful and prolonged winter storm and keep up to date with the forecast.\"\n\nDoyle Rice is a national correspondent for USA TODAY, with a focus on weather and climate.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: How much snow is your state getting this weekend?
