    "description": "The historic rally has carried over to the Toronto Stock Exchange, where the mining-heavy materials sector has led the index to record-breaking highs.",
    "fullText": "With many gold stocks cruising towards triple-digit gains in 2025, analysts say next year could be another period of blistering returns for companies mining the yellow metal.\n\nThe gold futures contract for February (GC=F) breached US$4,300 per ounce on Friday, a level not seen since October, when bullion hit an all-time high above US$4,350. This historic rally has carried over to the Toronto Stock Exchange, where the mining-heavy materials sector has led the index to record-breaking highs.\n\nAnalysts at RBC Capital Markets expect gold to average US$4,600 per ounce in 2026, ending the year at approximately US$4,800 per ounce. In 2027, their team, led by the bank’s head of global metals and mining research, sees bullion averaging US$5,100 per ounce.\n\n“Historically, gold producers have behaved pro-cyclically, resulting in sharply higher costs/capital, rising reserve assumptions, and increasing M&A in a rising price environment, which has ultimately eroded investor returns,” Josh Wolfson and his peers wrote in RBC’s latest global precious metals equities outlook.\n\n“Today, producers are operating with a significantly more prudent approach to capital allocation and discretionary spending, and we expect reserves to be calculated at a conservative <US$2,000/oz, less than 50 per cent of current gold prices,” Wolfson added. “Gold producers are experiencing a perfect storm, and are behaving responsibly.”\n\nThat said, RBC describes its outlook on gold stocks as “more conservative than consensus.” The bank expects capital spending to rise, as producers with extra cash look to squeeze returns from existing projects. They also see all-in sustaining costs, a key industry metric, rising by nine per cent in 2026.\n\nAmong the operators, Wolfson and his team say Canadian companies Agnico Eagle (AEM.TO)(AEM), Barrick Mining (ABX.TO)(B), and Kinross Gold (K.TO) have the most downside risk. On the other hand, RBC predicts shares of South Africa-based AngloGold Ashanti (AU) could see “modest upside,” versus its estimates.\n\nExchange-traded fund (ETF) provider Global X says its Gold Producers Index ETF (GLDX.TO) is the top-performing ETF in Canada year-to-date, excluding leveraged funds. The TSX-listed basket of stocks has gained nearly 178 per cent year-to-date. Barrick, AngloGold, and Kinross are its top three holdings.\n\n“Anytime something is up in the triple digits, I would say that probably exceeds expectations,” Chris McHaney, Global X’s head of investment management and strategy, told Yahoo Finance Canada.\n\n“You might see a similar type of return [in 2026]. With the gold price where it is, generally at all-time highs, the gold producers don’t really need the price of gold to continue going up. They just need it to stay relatively where it is, and they’ll be able to make significant cash flows from their operations.”",

Record warm temperatures along the West coast brought catastrophic flooding to the region while temperatures continue to plunge in the Midwest and Great Lakes regions as record cold and heavy snowfall dominate the area.\n\nEarlier this week the NWS issued a winter storm warning for several states, but played particular attention to Montana, which is expecting a surge in snowfall.\n\n“For the Winter Storm Warning, heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 6 and 12 inches, with localized amounts approaching 20 inches in the Island Ranges. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph,” the NWS said in a statement.\n\nThe heavy snowfall is expected to hit The Highwood, Little Belt, Judith, and Snowy Mountains, and Southern Rocky Mountain Front, though much of the middle part of the state is in danger of serious weather.\n\nAn interactive map from the National Weather Service shows the percentage change of a storm to exceed the initial warning criteria revealed for the area. Much of Montana sits in a very high probability range that weather will become much more serious than initially predicted, according to the model.\n\nAnother map from the NWS shows regions south of Lewistown, MT are expecting up to 24 inches of snow - or perhaps more as the scale tops out at 24 inches - through Sunday, Dec. 14.\n\nIn addition to a Winter Storm Warning, much of Montana received an Extreme Cold Warning as well, with temperatures dropping to more than 20 degrees below zero.",

    "description": "Two winter systems are expected to bring several rounds of accumulating snow to central Ohio beginning tonight and continuing into the weekend.",
    "fullText": "Break out the shovels, your weekend's about to get snowy.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Wilmington has issued a winter storm watch for several central Ohio counties, including Franklin, Licking, Preble, Montgomery, Greene, Fayette, Pickaway, Fairfield and Hocking.\n\nThe advisory issued the afternoon of Dec. 11, which includes Columbus, goes into effect Saturday, Dec. 13 and runs until the morning of Sunday, Dec. 14.\n\nThe watch says that accumulation of 3 to 5 inches is possible and could make travel difficult in parts of east central Indiana and central and west central Ohio.\n\nThere is also a chance of snow overnight and into the early morning of Friday, Dec. 12, with the forecast calling for some snow after 4 a.m.\n\nTwo separate weather systems will bring accumulating snow. First, 2-4 inches of snowfall is expected tonight into Friday morning, with impacts to the morning commute. Next, 2-4 inches of additional accumulation is possible Saturday afternoon into Saturday night. pic.twitter.com/hMLxv7qMy0\n\n— NWS Wilmington OH (@NWSILN) December 11, 2025\n\nNWS alerted these weather conditions in an X post on Dec. 11, explaining \"two separate weather systems will bring accumulating snow.\"\n\nThe NWS says the overnight snow could affect the Dec. 12 morning commute. So, it might be a good idea to leave early for work or school to give yourself time to get to where you're going safely.\n\nThe previous considerable snowstorm snarled traffic, resulted in multiple crashes and led to several school closings and delays across central Ohio.\n\nThe Climate Prediction Center (CPC) confirmed on Dec. 11 that the La Niña weather pattern would continue to impact weather across the country until February 2026.\n\nIn Ohio, La Niña winters mean colder conditions, especially if you live in the northern and eastern parts of the state.\n\nThe strong westerly to northwesterly winds crossing Lake Erie can fuel lake-effect snow along the snowbelt, impacting cities such as Cleveland, Toledo, and Sandusky. If the lake remains ice-free later into the season, as is expected in milder falls, snow events can be more frequent and intense.\n\nSouthern Ohio may not see significant lake-effect snow, but the region can still experience colder-than-average temperatures and occasional heavy snowfall when Arctic air aligns with storm systems.For example, during past La Niña winters, northern Ohio has seen multiple lake-effect snowstorms dropping several feet of snow in just a few days, while southern Ohio experienced sharp cold snaps and scattered snow events — a pattern that reflects the classic La Niña influence on the state.\n\nLa Niña isn't the only weather system influencing winter weather. The polar vortex is expected to impact Ohio. Dipping Arctic air and frigid temperatures will hit the entire state, according to AccuWeather. Indiana and Kentucky will also be affected.\n\n\"There is a massive area of air in northwestern Canada where temperatures are 20 to 30 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, and it is on its way southeastward into the U.S.,\" AccuWeather Chief On-Air Meteorologist Bernie Rayno said. \"This is the mother lode of cold air and is a term I don't use lightly.\"Over the next few days, extreme cold air will barrel into the central and eastern U.S. \"like a wrecking ball,\" said Weather Trader meteorologist Ryan Maue in a post on X on Dec. 9, as reported by USA TODAY. Maue dubbed it a \"textbook 'Polar Vortex' mega-dump of western Canadian cold.\"\n\nThe cold blast could be relatively short-lived, however. Forecasts expect a return to more typical wintry temperatures as the polar vortex retreats back to the north.\n\nCurrently, no schools in the Columbus area have announced closures for Dec. 12. That could change before the morning, so continue monitoring the storms at dispatch.com.\n\nToday: A slight chance of snow showers before 11 a.m. Mostly cloudy, with a high near 32 degrees. There will be west wind 8 to 10 mph. There is a 20% chance of precipitation.\n\nTonight: A chance of snow, mainly after 2 a.m. Cloudy, with a low around 26 degrees. There will be west wind around 5 mph becoming calm in the evening. There is a 40% chance of precipitation.

    "fullText": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Rains drenched Gaza’s tent camps and dropping temperatures chilled Palestinians huddling inside them Thursday as winter storm Byron descended on the war-battered territory, showing how two months of a ceasefire have failed to sufficiently address the spiraling humanitarian crisis there.\n\nFamilies found their possessions and food supplies soaked inside their tents. Children’s sandaled feet disappeared under opaque brown water that flooded the camps, running knee deep in some places. Dirt roads turned to mud. Piles of garbage and sewage cascaded like waterfalls.\n\n“We have been drowned. I don’t have clothes to wear and we have no mattresses left,” said Um Salman Abu Qenas, a displaced mother in a Khan Younis tent camp. She said that her family couldn't sleep the night before, because of the water in the tent.\n\nAid groups say not enough shelter materials are getting into Gaza during the truce. Figures recently released by Israel's military suggest it hasn't met the ceasefire stipulation of allowing 600 trucks of aid into Gaza a day, though Israel disputes that finding.\n\n“Cold, overcrowded, and unsanitary environments heighten the risk of illness and infection,” the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said on X. “This suffering could be prevented by unhindered humanitarian aid, including medical support and proper shelter.\"\n\nSabreen Qudeeh, also in the Khan Younis camp, in a squalid area known as Muwasi, said that her family woke up to rain leaking from their tent's ceiling and water from the street soaking their mattresses.\n\n“My little daughters were screaming,” she said.\n\nAhmad Abu Taha, also living in the camp, said there wasn't a tent that escaped the flooding. “Conditions are very bad, we have old people, displaced, and sick people inside this camp,” he said.\n\nFloods in south-central Israel trapped more than a dozen people in their cars, according to Hebrew media. Israel's rescue services, MDA, said that two young girls were slightly injured when a tree fell on their school.\n\nThe contrasting scenes with Gaza made clear how profoundly the Israel-Hamas war had damaged the territory, destroying the majority of homes. Gaza’s population of around 2 million is almost entirely displaced, and most people live in vast tent camps stretching along the coast, or set up among the shells of damaged buildings without adequate flooding infrastructure and with cesspits dug near tents as toilets.\n\nAt least three buildings in Gaza City already damaged by Israeli bombardment during the war partially collapsed under the rain, Palestinian Civil Defense said. It warned people not to stay inside damaged buildings, saying they too could fall down on top of them.\n\nThe agency also said that since the storm began, they have received more than 2,500 distress calls from people across Gaza whose tents and shelters were damaged.\n\nWith buckets and mops, Palestinians laboriously scooped water out of their tents.\n\nAliaa Bahtiti said her 8-year-old son \"was soaked overnight, and in the morning he had turned blue, sleeping on water.” Her tent floor had an inch of water on it “We cannot buy food, covers, towels, or sheets to sleep on.”\n\nBaraka Bhar was caring for her 3-month-old twins inside her tent as the rain poured outside. One of the twins has hydrocephalus, a build-up of fluids in the brain.\n\n“Our tents are worn out ... and they leak rain water,” she said. “We should not lose our children this winter.”\n\nAid groups say that Israel isn't allowing enough aid into Gaza to begin rebuilding the territory after years of war.\n\nUnder the agreement, Israel agreed to comply with aid stipulations from an earlier January truce, which specified that it allow 600 trucks of aid each day into Gaza, It maintains it's doing so, but The Associated Press found that some of its own figures call that into question.\n\nThe January truce also specified that Israel let in a number of caravans and tents. No caravans have yet entered Gaza during the ceasefire, said Tania Hary, executive director of Gisha, an Israeli group advocating for Palestinians’ right to freedom of movement.\n\nThe Israeli military body in charge of coordinating aid to Gaza, called COGAT, said on Dec. 9 it had “lately\" let 260,000 tents and tarpaulins into Gaza and more than 1,500 trucks of blankets and warm clothing.\n\nShelter Cluster, an international coalition of aid providers led by the Norwegian Refugee Council, sets the number lower. It says the U.N. and international nongovernmental organizations have gotten 15,590 tents into Gaza since the truce began, and other countries have sent about 48,000. Many of the tents aren't properly insulated, it says.\n\nAmjad al-Shawa, Gaza chief of the Palestinian NGO Network, told Al Jazeera on Thursday that only a fraction of the 300,000 tents needed had entered Gaza. He said that Palestinians were in dire need of warmer winter clothes and accused Israel of blocking the entry of water pumps to help clear flooded shelters..\n\n\"All international sides should take the responsibility regarding conditions in Gaza,” he said. “There is real danger for people in Gaza at all levels.”\n\nKhaled Mashaal, a Hamas leader, said in an interview with Al Jazeera that Gaza needs the rehabilitation of hospitals, the entry of heavy machinery to remove rubble, and the opening of the Rafah crossing — which remains closed after Israel said last week it would shortly open.\n\nCOGAT didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the claims that Israel wasn’t allowing water pumps or heavy machinery into Gaza\n\nAmnesty accuses Hamas of crimes against humanity\n\nAmnesty International said in a report released Thursday that Hamas and other militant groups committed crimes against humanity in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel that triggered the war in Gaza.\n\nIn the 173-page report, Amnesty pointed to what it found to be widespread and systematic killing of civilians in the attack, as well as torture, hostage-taking and sexual abuse.\n\nIn the attack, Hamas fighters and other militants rampaged through southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking around 250 others hostage. Israel's campaign in Gaza has since killed more than 70,300 Palestinians, roughly half of them women and children, according to the territory’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and civilians in its count. Last year, Amnesty accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, a charge Israel denied.\n\nAmnesty said it conducted interviews with 70 people, including 17 survivors of the attack and family members of some of those killed. It also reviewed hundreds of open-source videos and photos from the day of the attack.\n\nContrary to Hamas claims it was targeting the military, it said, the attack was intentionally “directed against a civilian population” and met international law standards for crimes against humanity.\n\nIt said sexual assaults were also committed, though it said it could not reach a conclusion on their “scope or scale.” It interviewed one man who testified he was raped by armed men at the Nova music festival, as well as a therapist who said she provided intensive treatment to three other survivors of rape.\n\nHamas condemned the report, saying it “echoed false claims” by Israel.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister spokesperson Oren Marmorstein derided the report in a posting on X, saying it took more than two years for Amnesty to address the attack “and even now its report falls far short of reflecting the full scope of Hamas’s horrific atrocities.”",

    "fullText": "\"Ultimately, what matters is your own interpretation of the ending and of the story,\" Expedition 33 creative director Guillaume Broche told GameSpot.\n\n on December 10, 2025 at 10:53AM PST\n\nThe Game Awards are just around the corner, and while this time of year is surely exciting for all the nominees--and those of us eager for new game announcements--this year, there is one studio in particular that has more reason than any to celebrate: Sandfall Interactive.\n\nEarlier this year, the small-scale studio took the world by storm with its debut title, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Despite being Sandfall's first game, the narrative-driven, turn-based RPG quickly entered the pantheon of all-time greatest RPGs, earning nearly universal critical acclaim for its artistry, story, and espousal of mechanics and themes typically associated with Japanese RPGs.\n\nNow, Sandfall Interactive stands poised to make The Game Awards history. Last month, the studio broke The Game Awards' record for most award nominations, earning a whopping 13, including Game of the Year. Earlier this year, I spoke with the studio's creative director, Guillaume Broche, who said the team was in \"disbelief\" about how the game has been received; it stands to reason that this sentiment has only grown with the game's tremendous success.\n\nBroche also shared a bit of a behind-the-scenes look at the game's development, explaining how there were \"a lot of arguments\" about the game's ending, why the team opted for minimal user interface, and how many people are still unaware of the game's biggest inspiration.\n\nGameSpot: Firstly, I'd love to know: What is the atmosphere of the studio following the game's tremendous success?\n\nBroche: I think a lot of us are still in disbelief with how the game’s launched and how fans have embraced it. Every day we say to each other, \"Is this real?\" or, \"Can you believe that?\" when we see another milestone reached or that our favorite game developer or studio reached out and congratulated us. It's all really overwhelming in a way, and we’re super grateful for everyone for their faith and support.\n\nAs I played through Expedition 33, it felt to me like the team took a \"less is more\" approach to creating the game. There are few UI elements on the screen and oftentimes, the character's expressions and what they don't say are just as impactful as what they do. That said, I'd like to hear in your own words about your design philosophies and principles, if you could elaborate on them.\n\nWe always wanted to tell a story that felt realistic and grounded. Of course, we have fantasy elements in the story, but at its core it’s a fundamentally human story. And in that story we wanted to have subtle, realistic interactions and emotions--which is why there’s a certain \"less is more\" feeling, like you say. It just makes the game feel more \"real\" in our eyes, or at least easier to engage with and relate to. Not every interaction in real life is a perfectly written, theatrical conversation--sometimes it’s just a look, or subtle moments of quietness, that have the most impact.\n\nFor the UI, we also wanted to have that same grounded approach to exploration. We trust the player to find their way through our levels, to understand our systems, and to engage with the world in the way we intended. We took some inspirations from games we grew up with in that sense, avoiding bloating our game with systems and designs that ultimately don’t improve the main game experience.\n\nI've found that Clair Obscur is phenomenal in working within shades of grey and every character feels deeply human. As such, reflecting on the game's ethics and big decisions are both interesting and challenging. Do you believe there truly is a true or \"good\" ending to the game?\n\nThat’s something we've had a lot of arguments about in the team too! I think your reaction to the endings, and which one is the \"good\" ending, is super subjective and related to your own personal experiences in real life. And I think that’s a strength of our writing and story--kudos to our Lead Writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, and our amazing mocap and voice actors for their performances--sometimes there is no clear \"good\" or \"bad\" choice in life that everyone will be happy with, and living within the grey, and those complex choices, are what makes us real people. Ultimately, what matters is your own interpretation of the ending and of the story.\n\nMany sites have been quick to note Legend of Dragoon, the Final Fantasy series, and even From Software titles as games that Clair Obscur has seemingly drawn inspiration from, but are there any other works that inspired you that you want to talk about?\n\nActually, I didn’t play Legend of Dragoon before coming up with the QTEs (quick-time events) during skills. I learnt later that a game did something similar! There are also other inspirations like the Persona series, but also action games like Devil May Cry and Nier.\n\nOne major inspiration is a French novel called La Horde du Contrevent. It tells the story of a group of explorers--or an expedition--travelling across the world to find the source of the supernatural wind that sweeps across the world. Their tale, and the human stories of the team and their discoveries as they travel the world, were also an inspiration for us as we developed a story of our own expeditioners traveling across the world. I’d recommend that anyone who’s a fan of our story picks up this book, but I don’t think it’s been translated into English fully since it’s so densely written with so much nuance in the French language. So I guess maybe fans should learn French, and then read the novel!\n\nWhether Clair Obscur will break the record currently held by The Last of Us: Part II and take home more than seven awards from The Game Awards remains to be seen. However, with 13 nominations and a Game of the Year award on the line, it's certainly worth tuning in to see what happens. The Game Awards airs tomorrow, December 11, at 9:30 PM ET / 6:30 PM PT.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?
