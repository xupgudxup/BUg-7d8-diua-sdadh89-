    "fullText": "ATLANTA (AP) — With many Americans still recovering from multiple blasts of snow and unrelenting freezing temperatures in the nation’s northern tier, a new storm is set to emerge this weekend that could coat roads, trees and power lines with devastating ice across a wide expanse of the South.\n\nThe storm arriving late this week and into the weekend is shaping up to be a “widespread potentially catastrophic event from Texas to the Carolinas,” said Ryan Maue, a former chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\n“I don’t know how people are going to deal with it,” he said.\n\nForecasters on Tuesday warned that the ice could weigh down trees and power lines, triggering widespread outages.\n\n“If you get a half of an inch of ice — or heaven forbid an inch of ice — that could be catastrophic,” said Keith Avery, CEO of the Newberry Electric Cooperative in South Carolina.\n\n‘Great swaths’ of heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain expected\n\nThe National Weather Service warned of \"great swaths of heavy snow, sleet, and treacherous freezing rain” starting Friday in much of the nation’s midsection and then shifting toward the East Coast through Sunday.\n\nTemperatures will be slow to warm in many areas, meaning ice that forms on roads and sidewalks might stick around, forecasters say.\n\nThe exact timing of the approaching storm — and where it is headed — remained uncertain on Tuesday. Forecasters say it can be challenging to predict precisely which areas could see rain and which ones could be punished with ice.\n\nCold air clashing with rain to fuel a 'major winter storm’\n\nAn extremely cold arctic air mass is set to dive south from Canada, setting up a clash with the cold temperatures and rain that will be streaming eastward across the southern U.S.\n\n“This is extreme, even for this being the peak of winter,” National Weather Service meteorologist Bryan Jackson said of the cold temperatures.\n\nWhen the cold air meets the rain, the likely result will be “a major winter storm with very impactful weather, with all the moisture coming up from the Gulf and encountering all this particularly cold air that’s spilling in,” Jackson said.\n\nAn atmospheric river could set up across the southern U.S.\n\nAn atmospheric river of moisture could be in place by the weekend, pulling precipitation across Texas and other states along the Gulf Coast and continuing across Georgia and the Carolinas, forecasters said.\n\n“Global models are painting a concerning picture of what this weekend could look like, with an increasingly strong signal for ice storm potential across North Georgia and portions of central Georgia,” according to the National Weather Service's Atlanta office.\n\nIf significant accumulations of ice strike metro Atlanta, it could be a problem through the weekend since low temperatures early Monday are expected to be around 22 degrees (minus 5.6 Celsius) in Atlanta. The city's high temperature on Monday is forecast to be around 35 degrees (1.7 Celsius).\n\nHighway and air travel could be tangled by the storm\n\nTravel is a major concern, as southern states have less equipment to remove snow and ice from roads, and extremely cold temperatures expected after the storm could prevent ice from melting for several days. In Michigan, more than 100 vehicles crashed into each other or slid off an interstate southwest of Grand Rapids on Monday.\n\nThe storm is also expected to impact many of the nation’s major hub airports, including those in Dallas; Atlanta; Memphis, Tennessee; and Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nPolar air from Canada to keep northern states in a deep freeze\n\nUnusually cold temperatures are already in place across much of the northern tier of the U.S., but the blast of arctic air expected later this week “will be the coldest yet,” Jackson said.\n\n“There’s a large sprawling vortex of low pressure centered over Hudson Bay,” Jackson said of the sea in northern Canada that’s connected to the Arctic Ocean. “And this is dominating the weather over all of North America.”\n\nTexas could be a harbinger for other parts of the South\n\nSome of the storm’s earliest impacts could be in Texas on Friday, as the arctic air mass slides south through much of the state, National Weather Service forecaster Sam Shamburger said in a briefing on the storm.\n\n“At the same time, we’re expecting rain to move into much of the state,” Shamburger said.\n\nLow temperatures could fall into the 20s or even the teens in parts of Texas by Saturday, with the potential for a wintery mix of weather in the northern part of the state.\n\nForecasters cautioned that significant uncertainty remains, particularly over how much ice or snow could fall across north and central Texas.\n\n“It’s going to be a very difficult forecast,” Shamburger said.\n\nAt an Arkansas hardware store, customers gear up for storm\n\nIn Little Rock, Arkansas, a steady stream of customers on Tuesday were stocking up on supplies at Fuller and Son Hardware.\n\n“Right now parents of young children are getting sleds,” said James Carter, the company’s director of operations.\n\nPeople were also getting shovels, ice-melting products and covers for outside faucets to keep them from freezing, since low temperatures in the Little Rock area are forecast to fall into the teens, he said.\n\nPanjwani reported from Washington.

    "description": "Amid severe geomagnetic storm conditions, the northern lights could be visible from even more states on Jan. 19",
    "fullText": "A strong geomagnetic storm could spark auroras in up to 24 U.S. states overnight Monday, Jan. 19, into early Tuesday, Jan. 20, according to NOAA forecasts\n\nAn Earth-directed coronal mass ejection from an X1.9 solar flare is expected to impact Earth’s magnetic field, potentially triggering G3 to G4 storm conditions\n\nClear skies following the new moon could make this event especially photogenic, with cameras capturing colors not visible to the naked eye\n\nLook up, because the sky’s about to put on a show!\n\nIf you’ve ever wanted to witness the northern lights without leaving the U.S., this could be your moment.\n\nThe aurora borealis (northern lights) is caused by geomagnetic storms, which occur when charged particles from the sun collide with gases in Earth's atmosphere, creating brilliant waves of light in the sky. Still, their visibility depends on several factors, including intensity and location.\n\nA surge of intense solar activity arrives just in time for January’s dark winter skies, setting the stage for auroras to push unusually far south across the country tonight, Jan. 19 and into the early hours of Tuesday, Jan. 20, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center.\n\nThis isn’t a subtle glow reserved for the Arctic Circle. This is a rare, high-impact space weather event that could bring auroras to mid-latitude regions just as the night sky reaches its darkest point.\n\nAccording to NOAA forecasters, Earth is bracing for a strong to potentially severe geomagnetic storm as charged solar particles slam into our planet’s magnetic field.\n\nThe trigger? A massive X1.9-class solar flare erupted from the sun, followed by an Earth-directed full halo (CME) coronal mass ejection, the kind that significantly increases the odds of intense auroral activity.\n\nThis is one of those nights where space weather, the lunar cycle and winter darkness conspire to create something extraordinary.\n\nHere’s exactly when to look, where to look and how to make the most of this stellar event.\n\nThe northern lights are expected overnight Monday, Jan. 19, into early Tuesday, Jan. 20, as Earth is impacted by a powerful geomagnetic storm.\n\nForecasters are predicting strong G3 conditions, with the potential for the storm to intensify to G4 (severe) on NOAA’s five-level scale.\n\nThis activity is being driven by a full-halo coronal mass ejection (CME), a massive cloud of charged solar particles released after an X1.9-class solar flare erupted from the sun on Sunday, Jan. 18.\n\nGiven that the CME is directed towards Earth, it has a higher chance of disturbing its magnetic field once it arrives. According to NOAA, “Higher storm levels are possible as early as the end of the day” on Mondaym Jan. 19.\n\nIf conditions peak as forecasted, auroras could be visible across up to 24 U.S. states, extending from the Canadian border down into mid-latitude regions.\n\nThe best chances of viewing will be in northern areas, including Alaska, Northern Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, North and South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, New York and Maine.\n\nIf the storm reaches G3 strength or higher, however, sighting could stretch further south into Oregon, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont and New Hampshire.\n\nSpace weather is notoriously difficult to predict, as everything depends on the speed and orientation of the solar wind.\n\nFor real-time updates, be sure to monitor NOAA’s 30-minute aurora forecast, SpaceWeatherLive.com or aurora-tracking apps such as Aurora Now, My Aurora Forecast, SpaceWeatherLive or Glendale Aurora.\n\nOne key indicator is the Bz component of the interplanetary magnetic field. When Bz turns southward, solar energy can more easily penetrate Earth’s magnetosphere. A sustained southward Bz of -5 nanoteslas or stronger often signals an imminent auroral display.\n\nDark skies will be especially favorable during this window, as the activity follows a new moon, meaning little to no moonlight to interfere with visibility.\n\nFrom northern U.S. states, any auroras that appear may glow low along the northern horizon.\n\nThe best part about the northern lights is that you can also make fun memories in the process. Your smartphone is more than enough, too! All you have to do is go to settings, turn on Night Mode and point your camera lens towards the sky.\n\nIf you’re a more seasoned skywatcher and happen to have a DSLR or mirrorless camera, grab a tripod and set your camera to manual mode. Don’t forget to stay warm!",

    "fullText": "Manchester City Women made light work of Bournemouth as they cruised into the fifth round of the FA Cup. Bunny Shaw opened the scoring before three goals in four minutes from Lauren Hemp and a double by Laura Coombs, sent City in 4-0 up at the interval. Vivianne Miedema got on the scoresheet with a second-half brace as Andree Jeglertz’ side extended their unbeaten run to 16 games in all competitions.\n\nCity had struggled last weekend against Everton in their first match after the international break, but ultimately came away with a 2-0 victory to remain top of the WSL. But there were no such problems against the National League South side, although the Cherries did pose City some problems at the start, with Jenna Markham trying her luck, with Khiara Keating saving well.\n\nCity then began to show their WSL quality and it was no surprise when Bunny Shaw headed the Blues in front in the 19th minute. Leila Ouahabi’s brilliant cross into the box was perfect for Shaw, and the Jamaican powered home a header to give City the lead.\n\nThe Blues continued to press but Bournemouth, despite being a goal down, were holding their own, and they would have been happy going into the break just a goal down. However, a flurry of goals in the space of four minutes ended any hopes of a comeback. Lauren Hemp drilled into the bottom right corner, before Coombs hit a two-minute brace to effectively put the Blues into the fifth round.\n\nMiedema got in on the act in the 58th minute, soon after Yui Hasegawa thundered a shot against the bar, tapping into an empty net thanks to a fortuitous deflection off Lily Murphy. The Dutch striker then put the Cherries to bed and one on the cake as she thumped home in the 85th minute.\n\nIn the end it was a routine victory for Jeglertz’s side and City will now go into their League Cup Tie with Chelsea on Wednesday full of confidence and eager to test themselves against the current WSL champions, in preparation for their upcoming tussle in the WSL at the beginning of February.\n\nFinal Score: Bournemouth Women 0-6 Manchester City Women",

    "fullText": "The Red Storm defied odds last season, winning the Big East regular-season championship and their first Big East Tournament title since 2000. But this year has been a different story. Rick Pitino’s side are 12–5 to start the season, they’ve fallen out of the rankings, and that comes with consequences.\n\nSt. John’s parted ways with general manager Matt Abdelmassih. He was long considered one of the most important figures behind St. John’s roster construction and transfer portal strategy. Abdelmassih had been on administrative leave since mid-December. According to journalist Roger Rubin of Newsday Sports, financial deals made by the General Manager had been under investigation in recent weeks, prompting his exit from the program.\n\nWhen Rick Pitino was asked about the situation, he had a rather cold response. “It’s out of my hands. I found out tonight. All I was told four days ago is look for another general manager. They said to me, ‘ don’t ask any questions.’ I said, ‘Okay, I’ll look for one.’ So, it’s really not a big deal,” Pitino said after the win against Marquette.\n\nHe continued, “What’s a big deal is making sure that we don’t lose anything. But that’s a university decision. I’ll abide by. They didn’t ask me my opinion, and I didn’t give it because they didn’t, and in their defense, they didn’t want to bother me. They didn’t want to distract me right now, and I appreciate that.”\n\nThe post Rick Pitino Offers Cold Reality Check After St. John’s Parts Ways With GM Abdelmassih appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "description": "Maddow taunted President Donald Trump over a series of recent failures and rebukes from courts and even some Republicans on a variety of issues.",
    "fullText": "MS NOW host Rachel Maddow taunted President Donald Trump over a series of recent failures and rebukes from courts and even some Republicans on a variety of issues.\n\nThe second term of Trump’s presidency has seen a steady erosion of support over issues like the Epstein files and rebukes from federal courts over a raft of policies. But those rebukes have picked up pace recently.\n\nOn Monday night’s edition of MS NOW’s The Rachel Maddow Show, the host ticked through the latest of them. She then gloated that Trump “is losing all the time and everywhere now”:\n\nYou might not have seen the headline today that today a federal court blocked the Trump administration from cutting energy funding just for blue states. This is billions of dollars Congress appropriated for clean energy projects of various kinds all over the country.\n\nTrump administration decided, and they admitted this — they decided that just in blue states, just in states that didn’t vote for Trump, they would cut all of that funding. They’d leave the funding in place in states that voted for Trump. They would cut it in states that didn’t vote for Trump.\n\nA federal court today ruled that that is illegal and stopped the Trump administration from doing that. That ruling today came after another federal court today stopped Trump from shutting down a big offshore wind farm in Rhode Island and Connecticut. Trump’s shutdown of that project, according to the courts today, was also illegal.\n\nAnd so, yet another federal court blocked Trump on that as well. So that work on the wind farm will be able to go ahead. Both of those rulings today follow.\n\nLast night, yet another federal court blocking Trump, this time from cutting funding to the American academy of pediatrics. This is a doctor’s group of pediatricians group that criticized the flock of ducks level insane quackery at Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services under RFK Jr.\n\nTrump responded by canceling federal grants for the American Academy of Pediatrics. A judge has now ruled that that was illegal retaliation. And so, Trump is blocked from doing that. That funding has to be reinstated.\n\nThat ruling comes after another federal judge just blocked Trump from cutting off federal election funds to states in retaliation for them not changing their election rules in ways that Trump wants. The judge said, quote, “the Constitution assigns no authority to the president over federal election administration.” And so, Trump got blocked on that one, too.\n\nShall I keep going? I could keep going. Another federal court just blocked Trump from freezing billions of dollars for childcare and social services for kids, again, in Democratic run states, as some kind of punishment against those states for electing Democrats, punishing them for that by cutting off the temporary assistance to needy families program.\n\nBecause, you know, you know, what would Jesus do? Trump was also just blocked from a — from doing that by yet another federal court.\n\nIt`s almost like he is losing all the time and everywhere now. There may still be people in America who are shocked that Trump keeps breaking the law over and over again, blatantly and insistently. The courts no longer appear to be shocked by that, and the courts now are just telling him no very bluntly, every single day, and often multiple times a day.\n\nAnd it’s not even just the courts, as I know you are aware, last week in one 48-hour stretch, we had a Senate vote for a War Powers resolution to block Trump from any further military adventurism. In Venezuela, five Republican senators crossed over to side with Democrats to pass that War Powers resolution. It was enough to advance that it’s going to get another vote in the Senate this week.\n\nThat came right on the heels of 17 Republicans in the House breaking ranks with Trump and siding with Democrats on the Affordable Care Act to try to, at least temporarily, undo the disastrous decision Trump and Republicans made in their so-called big beautiful bill. The decision to send tens of thousands of American families’ health insurance rates through the roof.\n\nSeventeen Republicans crossed over, defied Trump and joined with Democrats to pass that health care matter in the House.\n\nNow it`s going to come to the senate. Trump is now whining about how he might have to veto it if and when it passes in the senate as well, because he definitely wants to make sure that people’s health insurance premiums double or triple in cost for nothing other than something that he personally did. He apparently wants that.\n\nI mean, what we’ve just seen in Congress is one of the worst rebukes Trump has had from congressional Republicans since he has been back in office this whole disastrous year.\n\nWatch above via MS NOW’s The Rachel Maddow Show.\n\nThe post MS NOW’s Rachel Maddow Taunts Trump Over Blizzard of Defeats: ‘Losing All the Time and Everywhere!’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Meredith Whitney predicted one crash, and sees another storm coming",
    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nMeredith Whitney earned her “Oracle of Wall Street” nickname by predicting the 2008 financial crisis before it hit. Now, nearly two decades later, she sees fresh trouble brewing — this time, in the U.S. housing market.\n\n“The housing market is gummed up with existing home sales on track in 2025 to be their slowest in more than 25 years,” Whitney wrote in a piece for the Financial Times (1). “The next few years may not be much better.”\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nGet early access to privately-held AI companies with Fundrise Venture Capital for as little as $10. Join 350,000+ investors today\n\nThe problem is tied to demographic shifts. Whitney reports that over 54% of homes in the U.S. are owned by seniors — 10% more than in 2008. Most of them own their homes outright, meaning they’re mortgage-free. According to property brokerage platform Redfin, 78% of seniors want to remain in their current home rather than downsize (2).\n\nIn an interview with Marketwatch earlier this year, Whitney said, “Either these folks have no mortgage, or a small mortgage, and the capital gains that they have to take and the costs that are required to move are prohibitive (3).”\n\nHere’s how this is affecting boomers and America’s housing supply.\n\nWhitney added that the potential tax bite from selling your home means baby boomers may not be as wealthy as they think.\n\nAfter selling your primary residence, the IRS allows you to deduct up to $250,000 from the home’s selling price (or $500,000 for joint filers) to reduce your capital gains liability (4). Given that this threshold was set in 1997, it’s not nearly as helpful now as it was when home prices were far lower.\n\nWhitney is not the only one raising red flags.\n\nLast September, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said that the housing market is “in part frozen” with many homeowners reluctant to sell because they’re locked in at lower mortgage rates (5). These rates date back to the pandemic, which were between 0% and 0.25% according to Brookings (6).\n\nThe result? Persistently high prices combined with elevated interest rates, which can render homeownership harder than ever to achieve.\n\nAccording to Realtor.com, the typical U.S. household earned roughly 46% less than what’s recommended to afford a $439,950 home, which was the median list price for an American home as of July (7). In December, the median price of a home had dropped to $415,000, meaning that prices had improved — but not by much (8).",

The leaderboards will be divided by the seven playable classes--Paladin, Rogue, Druid, Barbarian, Sorcerer, Necromancer, and Spiritborn.

    "description": "Is the US labor market in the calm before the storm? Economists say the Beveridge curve is the signal to watch.",
    "fullText": "Is the US labor market in the calm before the storm?\n\nOne model that's closely followed by academics but which tends to fly under the radar for most investors suggests that could be the case — and it's spooking some economists.\n\nWhile the December nonfarm payrolls report, released on Friday, showed that the US added 50,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.4% from 4.5%, the so-called Beveridge curve indicates that the labor market could be on the verge of a quick deterioration.\n\nThe Beveridge curve considers the relationship between the unemployment rate and the number of job openings relative to the amount of overall jobs (the job vacancy rate) over the course of a multi-year labor market cycle. As the job vacancy rate continues to fall, signaling it's more difficult to find work, the unemployment rate eventually reaches a tipping point and begins to rise sharply.\n\nUsing 2022 or 2023 as the top of the most recent labor cycle — when the job vacancy rate was around its peak — we can see that conditions are ripe for unemployment to trend upward, and the job vacancy rate has dropped to 4.6%.\n\nThe current cycle is shown in teal dots in the chart below, shared in December by Neil Dutta, the chief US economist at Renaissance Macro Research, who is warning that downside risks to the labor market are higher than upside risks for inflation.\n\nSo far, both hiring and layoff rates have been low, allowing unemployment to stay range-bound. But if layoffs were to increase, the scarce number of jobs on the market could put the economy into trouble.\n\nMatt Bush, US economist at Guggenheim Investments, which oversees more than $357 billion in assets, told Business Insider on Friday that while he thinks the labor market will remain intact in the months ahead, the prospect of rising unemployment is still a threat that investors should be paying attention to.\n\n\"I would say that recession risk is still probably well above normal, given this fragility in the labor market,\" Bush said. \"Because hiring is so low right now, it wouldn't take a big increase in layoffs to see unemployment rise pretty meaningfully.\"\n\nHe continued: \"So because of that, any even somewhat small shock to business confidence could see a pick up in layoffs and a pretty quick and sharp rise in the unemployment rate. It's not our base case, but it is a key risk that we're watching.\"\n\nPeter Berezin, the chief global strategist at BCA Research, recently expressed his concern around another indicator closely tied with the Beveridge curve: the ratio of jobs to workers. It is now negative, meaning there are more workers than there are total jobs (filled or not).\n\n\"The US labor market has reached a critical threshold: The jobs-workers gap has turned negative, signalling that the economy has reached the flat side of the Beveridge curve,\" Berezin wrote in a LinkedIn post. \"A further decline in job openings could push it into recession.\"\n\nThere are other signs that labor market conditions are set to worsen. The unemployment rate recently ticked above its three-month moving average, which has only occurred before or during recessions dating back to the 1940s.\n\nThe Conference Board's \"labor differential\" measure, which compares the number of survey respondents who say jobs are \"plentiful\" versus \"hard to get,\" is also trending higher. The metric tends to move alongside the unemploymnet rate.\n\nBut for now, at least, investors can take solace in Friday's steady unemployment number despite a relatively low print of 50,000 jobs added, Bush said.\n\n\"It's reassuring that we're not seeing this spiral where lower job growth leads to lower spending and that leads to further layoffs and that sort of recessionary snowball effect,\" Bush said. \"And I think it's because labor supply is also cooling alonside labor demand.\"",

    "fullText": "America’s distilleries have faced a perfect storm of economic and market headwinds that has pushed many out of business in recent years.\n\nFirst, many Americans are drinking less, especially younger ones.\n\n\"Young adults in the U.S. have become progressively less likely to use alcohol over the past two decades, with the percentages of 18- to 34-year-olds saying they ever drink, that they drank in the past week and that they sometimes drink more than they shouldall lower today. At the same time, drinking on all three metrics has trended up among older Americans while holding fairly steady among middle-aged adults,\" according to a Gallup poll.\n\n62% of adults under age 35 say they drink, down from 72% two decades ago.\n\nConversely, drinking has increased among adults aged 55 and older.\n\nYoung adults are also drinking less frequently and are less likely to drink to excess.\n\nIn addition, distilleries continue to feel the effects of tariffs imposed during President Donald Trump’s administration, which have increased production costs and contributed to a sharp drop in U.S. whiskey exports to key markets like the EU.\n\n“We’re very worried about what tariffs could do to our industry,” said Eric Gregory, president of the Kentucky Distillers Association, reported WKYT.\n\nTake those two challenges together, and it's not surprising that American distilleries, including Artisan Distillery & Craft Bar, have decided to close their doors.\n\nThose impacts are already being felt.\n\nAmerican Whiskey exports to the EU, the U.S. spirits industry’s largest export market, have tumbled by 33% and cost $300 million since the EU’s 25% retaliatory tariff went into effect on June 22, 2018, according to a new report released by the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States on the two-year anniversary.\n\nThe EU levied the destructive tariff in response to U.S. tariffs on EU steel and aluminum.\n\n“American distillers enjoyed two decades of unparalleled growth in the EU prior to the implementation of these retaliatory tariffs,” said Chris Swonger, CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS). “This report makes clear that these tariffs took the wind out of the sails for American Whiskey exports to our top export market, which has resulted in a loss of more than a quarter of a billion dollars of sales.”\n\nArtisan Distillery & Craft Bar became famous for its Spike Vodka, a spirit made with nopal instead of the traditional fermented cereal grains or potatoes. Later, the distillery added gin, whisky, moonshine, and a tequila-like agave liquor and branched out to brewing beer.",

Below you'll find a list, in no particular order, of some of the top MMORPGs to play in 2026, ranging from tried-and-true classics of the genre to hybrids that combine the best of traditional fantasy-themed MMOs with elements of shooters, space exploration, and more. Some of the games below also happen to be some of the best free-to-play games available.\n\nBlizzard might not have invented the MMORPG, but it certainly popularized it, as it took a genre known for having a steep learning curve and made it more approachable than ever before with streamlined mechanics, punchy combat, instanced dungeons and raids, and its signature level of polish. As a result, WoW is still going strong today and remains one of the best PC MMORPGs to play, having received nine expansions to date (with a 10th on the way). In WoW, players choose a faction--the Alliance or the Horde--as well as a race and class, and from there embark on an adventure to defend the fantasy world of Azeroth from all manner of threats. Each of the game's 13 classes feels distinct, with multiple sub-classes to choose from, and there's an ever-expanding list of fantasy races to play as and customize.\n\nWoW celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2024, as Blizzard kicked-off a three-expansion storyline called The Worldsoul Saga with the release of the game's excellent and approachable The War Within expansion. Blizzard celebrated WoW's big anniversary by dropping some big news as well--after two decades, WoW will finally receive player housing as part of its next expansion, and in a recent preview made clear that unlike in some MMOs, housing in WoW will be available for everyone.\n\nWhile the main version of WoW has continued to evolve over the last 20 years, a large and vocal contingent of fans yearned for the early days of the MMO, before more-recent expansions forever transformed the game's world and Blizzard updated much of its visuals, gameplay, and classes. Blizzard finally listened in 2019 with the release of WoW Classic, a return to the game's earliest, pre-expansion days.\n\nWoW Classic's release proved to be a huge success, and Blizzard now offers multiple different flavors of old-school WoW all under one subscription price, one that also grants access to the modern version of WoW. Players can still check out the 2004-era version of Azeroth (which received new servers to start fresh on in November 2024 for the game's 20th anniversary), or move forward in time and play one of the game's older expansions, like 2010's Cataclysm (soon to be 2012's Mists of Pandaria). There are even seasonal servers, like the still ongoing Season of Discovery, which adds new items, raid content, and class changes to the original version of Blizzard's genre-defining title.\n\nSince the genre's inception, many MMORPGs have featured familiar sword-and-sorcery trappings. It only makes sense then that the granddaddy of the modern fantasy genre, The Lord of the Rings, was a prime candidate to get the MMO treatment following the massive success of WoW. Enter The Lord of the Rings Online, a game that couldn't have come from a more veteran MMORPG team, with developer Turbine having been responsible for MMO classics like 1999's Asheron's Call and its sequel. The Lord of the Rings Online has since changed developers, but its current developer, Standing Stone Games, is composed of many former Turbine developers. Better yet, it still receives new content updates and expansions, with its most recent, Legacy of Morgoth, having arrived in November 2024.\n\nThough very much following in the footsteps of WoW, it fittingly places a much larger emphasis on story than Blizzard's MMO and delivers a painstakingly detailed version of JRR Tolkien's Middle-earth for players to explore and immerse themselves in.\n\nFinal Fantasy is one of the biggest RPG franchises of all time, and as such has not one, but two MMORPGs to its name. Though 2002's Final Fantasy XI is still playable, it's Square Enix's more-recent MMO, Final Fantasy XIV, that has blossomed into one of the best MMORPGs of all time. When it was first released, it was a critical and commercial failure. But several years and many updates later, the game was re-released as Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, completely reworking many of the original game's systems, story, and structure. Now, Final Fantasy XIV is one of the top MMORPG games today and one of the best PS5 and Xbox MMORPGs available, having long been playable on PlayStation and more recently launching on Xbox Series X|S.\n\nIts flexible job system means players don't need to create a new character every time they want to try a new role, and despite being a MMORPG with a massive shared world to explore, its main story, over-the-top boss battles, and excellent music all deliver on what RPG fans expect from a game sharing the Final Fantasy name. Its latest expansion, Dawntrail, released in July 2024.\n\nFuncom is no stranger to MMORPGs, having previously made titles like Anarchy Online and Age of Conan. The studio's latest foray into the genre is its most ambitious yet, adapting author Frank Herbert's sci-fi Dune saga into a massive survival MMORPG where players battle to survive on the harsh desert world of Arakkis. Dune: Awakening is definitely a survival game first and foremost, with players needing to gather resources, manage their water levels, build shelter, and advance their gear to progress.\n\nHowever, MMO staples like faction reputation, class-skill trees, open-world dungeons, and a massive, ever-changing endgame PvP zone that brings together hundreds of players also firmly make Dune: Awakening a MMORPG. Its unique mix of third-person shooting, melee, and vehicular combat helps to further distinguish it from the many fantasy-themed MMOs on the market, making for an enticing combination of genres, gameplay, and aesthetics. Just keep in mind that getting killed by one of the desert's massive sandworms means losing everything on your character at that moment--the desert claims the weak.\n\nOne of the first big new MMORPGs in years, Amazon's New World made quite a splash when it released in 2021, breaking concurrent player records on Steam. The hype has since died down quite a bit, but New World is still an extremely solid MMORPG that received a major overhaul on PC and launched on consoles in the form of New World: Aeternum in October 2024. In New World: Aeternum, players wash up the mysterious island from which the game takes its name, one that has trapped various civilizations and explorers from throughout human history. From there they join one of three different factions, each with their own idea of what to do with the mystical land they now call home. Instead of classes, players instead can equip two different weapon types, which define what skills can be used and what stats a player may want to strive for when gearing their character.\n\nThe New World: Aeternum update bundled in the game's sole expansion, and in the process significantly reworked much of the game's story and its early-game questing, two of its biggest weaknesses prior to the update. Amazon also recently debuted seasonal servers that change up New World: Aeternum's normal gameplay in major ways, ranging from servers that put a heavy focus on open-world PvP to \"hardcore\" servers with faster progression where the goal is to never die even once.\n\nThe developer behind the Halo series took many of the ideas popularized in MMORPGs like WoW--dungeons, raids, classes, special abilities, color-coated loot--and applied it to a smaller-scale, sci-fi FPS. The result was Destiny and its sequel, Destiny 2. Bungie has proven it's still king when it comes to making a great-feeling shooter, and it never gets old blasting ancient aliens or genocidal robots with all manner of Destiny's 2 powerful Exotic weapons. When combined with the social elements of MMOs like shared worlds to explore, larger-scale public events, and multiplayer dungeons and raids filled with complex puzzles and mechanics, Destiny 2 forms an impressive genre cocktail that can be hard to put down.\n\nEverything Bungie has been building towards for over a decade may have culminated in 2024's The Final Shape expansion, but Destiny 2 is still receiving new updates and expansions, with the new Edge of Fate expansion releasing July 15. Destiny 2 is also widely available, making it both one of the best cross-platform games to play with friends and one of the best PS5 and Xbox MMORPG games out there.\n\nGuild Wars 2 was a breath of fresh air when it released in 2012, and for good reason. It put a new spin on many of the tried-and-true tropes and systems seen in popular MMORPGs like WoW, with an emphasis on open-world content. Combined with its flashy movement, impressive visuals compared to many other MMOs, and engaging combat that combines class skills with unique weapon abilities, Guild Wars 2 still stands out from the competition as one of the top MMORPG games available on PC.\n\nIn 2025, Guild Wars 2 is still regularly receiving new updates and expansions, in part thanks to a recent restructuring of how developer ArenaNet develops new content. Its latest expansion, Janthir Wilds, introduced several new big features, including player housing and the spear weapon-type. Unlike many of the biggest MMORPGs, Guild Wars 2 doesn't require a subscription to play, making it an appealing choice for aspiring MMO players on a budget.\n\nOne of the more popular Korean MMORPGs, Lost Ark came to the West with the help of Amazon Games and quickly set itself apart thanks to its isometric perspective and lack of a box price or mandatory subscription fee. In Lost Ark, players choose a class and then embark on a quest to discover the titular lost Arks scattered throughout the fantasy world of Arkesia. It's a journey that takes players to both huge, story-heavy new continents and to small, one-off islands that are home to some truly fun minigame events, all which players sail to on their own personal boat.\n\nSprinkle in some truly fantastic endgame raids and impressive Monster Hunter-like boss battles, and Lost Ark is well worth playing for those looking for a MMORPG that plays closer to some of the best Diablo-like games than it does WoW, albeit minus the fountains of loot. Three years later, the game is still receiving frequent updates, with a new class, the shapeshifting Wildsoul, debuting in February 2025.\n\nFallout 76 didn't exactly have a smooth start in 2018, with players criticizing it for a laundry list of bugs, performance issues, lack of NPC characters, and more. But Bethesda never gave up on its multiplayer Fallout experiment, and in 2025, Fallout 76 is a great way to experience one of gaming's best RPG universes alongside dozens of other players.\n\nLike traditional Fallout games, players scrounge their way through an apocalyptic wasteland on the hunt for supplies and gear. Unlike single-player entries in the franchise, however, dozens of players in Fallout 76 can team up to fend off waves of Super Mutants, battle massive monsters as part of the game's numerous public events, or even drop nukes on one another. Bethesda added Expeditions to the list of things to do in Fallout 76 back in 2022. These allow players to team up and venture outside the game's Appalachian Wasteland to other scenic locales, like Fallout 3's The Pitt, for dungeon-like missions, further giving the FPS RPG a distinct MMO flavor.\n\nFallout 76 has seen a resurgence in interest thanks to the launch of the TV show adaptation, making this a great time to jump in. Its most recent content update, Gone Fission, added fishing as a new activity, with players able to complete various fishing-themed quests and upgrade their fishing pole to tackle new challenges. For more on the franchise, check out our look at the best Fallout games.\n\nStar Wars: The Old Republic will feel familiar to anyone who has played WoW but is no less worthy a time investment for those looking to dive deeper into the Star Wars universe. Originally developed by BioWare, a studio known for its RPG storytelling, Star Wars: The Old Republic unsurprisingly puts its story front and center, with dialogue wheels, fully voiced characters, and impactful narrative choices that feel right at home in a single-player RPG. It also features unique storylines for each of the game's eight classes, meaning there is plenty of replay value for players who can't make up their mind on which class to play. As much as it emulates WoW in its gameplay, Star Wars: The Old Republic does include features that have yet to come to Blizzard's MMO, including player housing and NPC companions.\n\nThough the game recently changed developers (with some former members of BioWare joining Broadsword, which also oversees classic MMORPGs owned by EA like Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot), it still receives new story content and events, making it the top MMORPG game for Star Wars fans and one of the best Star Wars games of all time.\n\nWhile it may still be quite some time until The Elder Scrolls 6, those longing for a return to Tamriel will find plenty to enjoy in The Elder Scrolls Online, which celebrated its 10th anniversary last year. The MMORPG spin on Bethesda's popular RPG series will feel familiar to those who have played single-player entries in the franchise, with the ability to play in first or third-person, NPC companions, various guilds to join, options to steal from NPCs, and more. Players choose an assortment of skills both from their chosen weapon and armor type but also their class in order to make unique builds that can be used to conquer dungeons and raids with other players. Compared to other, more-traditional MMORPGs playable on consoles, its smaller number of skills and easy-to-read user interface make ESO one of the top Xbox and PS5 MMORPG games, even if it sadly doesn't support cross-play or cross-progression across platforms.\n\nIn 2025, developer ZeniMax Online is making some big changes to ESO's content schedule. It's forgoing the yearly expansion model used for almost a decade and instead focusing on smaller, more frequent seasonal updates that will help to deliver on efforts to improve the game across the board. Those efforts include major experiments like Cyrodiil Champions meant to improve the MMO's open-world PvP and a renewed focus on the new and returning player experience. Its current season, Seasons of the Worm Cult, continues the base game's main storyline, while a free update for all players in June added the ability to subclass, allowing for the mixing and matching of abilities from different classes in order to create entirely new playstyles.\n\nIt may not look like much, but Runescape, which is now in its 23rd year and comes in both its slightly-more-modern Runescape 3 form as well as Old School Runescape, is still one of the best MMORPG games of all time. It may be simple by modern standards, but there is a certain joy to be found in its point-and-click gameplay and its monotonous, yet satisfying, crafting skill grind.\n\nLike all great sandbox MMORPGs, Runescape largely leaves players to decide for themselves what interests to pursue, whether it's completing quests, mastering their crafting skills, or player-killing out in the Wilderness. It's one of the few great mobile MMORPG games available, complete with cross-play and cross-progression across platforms. Those who want to get the full Runescape experience will likely want to Jagex recently announced the first new skill in Old School Runescape history, sailing, will be added later in 2025.\n\nFor those who want a little more Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (with a large dose of anime) in their MMORPG, Tower of Fantasy is exactly what the doctor ordered. It shares plenty of DNA with the more-popular (but also largely single-player) Genshin Impact, but distinguishes itself with its shared open world, public events, co-op dungeons and a more sci-fi aesthetic. There's always something to explore, and it's easy to climb any mountain or glide to any distant spot that sparks interest. Similar to Genshin, its character-swapping action combat combined with each character's various elemental affinities keeps Tower of Fantasy's moment-to-moment gameplay interesting, especially as players earn new characters, form teams, and create new combos.\n\nThough players are more than capable of playing through its main story and many of its challenges with the game's various free characters, be warned that this is a gacha game, and many of its best characters will be inaccessible without spending large sums of money on the premium currency used to make luck-of-the-draw pulls.\n\nLike Destiny 2, Warframe isn't what many players would think of when it comes to a traditional MMORPG, but it has so many elements of the genre--shared spaces with large numbers of players, instanced dungeons and raids, high levels of customizability, crafting, guilds, etc.--that it's an MMO in all but name. Warframe has been around for over a decade, and in that time has continued to deliver best-in-class third-person-shooter gameplay alongside game-changing updates that have introduced spaceship combat, large-scale open worlds, and new story content to its sci-fi, cyber-ninja-filled universe.\n\nWith a \"Very Positive\" average user review score after over half a million reviews and counting on Steam, Warframe continues to impress, and features cross-play and cross-progression across PC, iOS, and consoles. It's also available on Nintendo Switch, making it one of the best Switch MMORPG games. A fantasy-themed successor, Soulframe, is slated to receive an open pre-alpha playtest this year.\n\nA top-down fantasy MMORPG that will look and feel familiar to Runescape fans, Albion Online takes its sandbox gameplay even further, with an almost entirely player-run economy, classless combat, and a focus on full-loot PvP with large-scale guild battles over territory. With PvP being such a large part of the endgame, and the high stakes of losing one's items when dying in PvP, Albion Online won't be for everyone.\n\nThere is PvE as well, with dungeons to explore and bosses to slay. For more farming or crafting-minded players, there is also the ability to build a home or even buy a private island and transform it into a farm, too. Few MMORPGs in the modern age truly commit to a sandbox approach like Albion Online, making it more than worth checking out, but those who have no interest in PvP or are easily frustrated by setbacks may want to look elsewhere.\n\nFor those who want to live out a superhero (or villain) fantasy instead of the sword-and-sorcery kind, there's DC Universe Online. Players can create their character, choose from a number of different powers, customize their costume, and then fight alongside iconic DC characters while exploring locations like Gotham City, Metropolis, and Arkham Asylum. DC Universe Online has been going steady for 14 years now and still receives multiple new episodic story updates for free each year. The latest episode, the Lantern Corp-focused Fearful Day, released in May\n\nAll of DCUO's new story content is free, though those with an optional subscription will be able to enjoy more rewards, character slots, and powers to choose from. DCUO isn't the only superhero MMORPG on the block, but its wide availability on both consoles and PC (and cross-play between PlayStation and PC players) does make it an easy choice for this list.\n\nThrone and Liberty's gameplay will instantly feel familiar to anyone who has played an MMORPG in the last two decades, with tab-targeting combat that heavily evokes WoW's gameplay. Where Throne and Liberty differs is in its impressive graphical fidelity, focus on open-world PvP, skills defined by weapon type instead of classes, and the use of players' animal-shapeshifting forms in order to sprint, glide, and swim around its world of Solisium instead of traditional mounts. Though much of its endgame focus is on large guild vs. guild castle sieges, there is still plenty of PvE content as well, including world events and dungeons.\n\nGiven its free-to-play nature, its endgame can become a bit grindy, but those looking for a satisfying MMORPG without a subscription could do much worse than Throne and Liberty. It's also one of the few MMORPGs on consoles, and, unlike other console MMOs like ESO, supports cross-play between platforms. Its first free expansion, Wilds of Talandre, releases in March 2025 and will introduce a new zone to explore, solo dungeons for players to conquer, and a revamp of its weapon mastery system.\n\nKnown for its massive spaceship battles with thousands of players, EVE Online is still one of the best MMORPGs available after two decades on the market. A true sandbox MMO where players are largely left to pursue their own interests--whether that's engaging in PvP battles or starting a trade empire--the entirety of its player base plays on a single server, and the actions its players take leave a lasting impact both on its in-game universe and its bustling player-driven economy.\n\nEven if its actual gameplay isn't quite as exciting as it might sound on paper (get used to looking at lots of menus and going AFK while your ship completes assigned actions), it's the stakes behind each action that give everything in EVE Online's world meaning. EVE Online can certainly be confusing for new players, but for those who stick with it and get involved with its various player-run communities, it's easy to see why the game is still being played 20 years later.\n\nThe original superhero MMO, 2004's City of Heroes, has found new life after having been taken offline by NCSoft in 2012. A fan server called City of Heroes: Homecoming received an official license to operate the game in 2024, and now City of Heroes is once again playable completely for free, with a volunteer team keeping the game running and updated thanks to player donations.\n\nCity of Heroes stands out thanks to its detailed character creator, where players get to choose not only their powers, but their origin story, costume, and even backstory. From there it's up to players to protect Paragon City as a hero or join the forces of villainy on The Rogues Isle, battling foes and joining Supergroups of other players along the way. Though City of Heroes is somewhat dated by today's standards, there is a reason many players have fond memories of their time with the MMO, as it offers a unique experience that can't be found in other games within the genre, even as games like DC Universe Online and Cryptic's spiritual successor, Champions Online, have since looked to follow in City of Heroes' footsteps.\n\nBlack Desert is a highly in-depth MMORPG that places a major emphasis on combat systems and customization. You might have heard that Black Desert has one of the steepest learning curves of any MMO, and that statement wouldn't be inaccurate. There are over a dozen classes to pick from in Black Desert, and each one offers a totally different way of approaching combat. You'll mostly engage in combat with real players and AI enemies, both of which require the utmost precision and lightning-fast reflexes to defeat. However, Black Desert also offers siege combat, allowing you to participate in large-scale wars in PvE or PvP.\n\nIf combat isn't your main interest, Black Desert features a massively open world with a slew of content to explore. You can complete quests, level up a slew of skills, and hunt for new gear. You'll also be able to customize your character in truly staggering ways, as the game has hundreds of clothing and appearance options.\n\nOnce Human isn't your traditional World of Warcraft-type MMORPG, but it's still a massive role-playing game nonetheless. The game starts by you joining a server and going through a tutorial for how its various mechanics work. Then, you'll be on your own in a huge map that features differently-scaled areas. Each area is available for you to venture into from the start, but the enemies in an area will all be at a specific level. To successfully navigate the areas, you need to level up your character by completing main story quests, which mainly involve the same gameplay loop, and jobs for various NPCs at the hub center of each area.\n\nCombat in Once Human involves guns as well as melee and long-range weapons, and all of the weapons in the game can be crafted at your base. Base-building plays a major role in Once Human, as it's how you unlock a majority of the game's usable content and helps to level up your character. When you venture outside your base, though, you'll have to keep your character healthy, as Once Human is also a survival game that has a hunger, thirst, and stamina bar, all of which need to be constantly maintained. It's a unique MMO experience that relies less on multiplayer elements, but other real players are still packed into a server with you.\n\nThe First Descendant is a game that falls somewhere in between a few different genres. However, by definition, it's a massively multiplayer online game that features role-playing elements. At its core, however, The First Descendant is a looter shooter that allows you to team up with other players to complete PvE objectives and defeat bosses. There is no PvP combat, but there's certainly enough content to keep you invested. The looting, which comes from defeating enemies and quests, is mostly RNG, so you'll often have to grind for hours to unlock a piece of content for your character or weapons. The gameplay is extremely enjoyable, though, so you'll often have no quarrel with grinding out gear.\n\nPalia is one of the very few MMORPGs that doesn't feature any sort of combat. Instead, you're placed in a world where you're tasked with building your dream home. Set in a fantasy world, Palia also falls into the life-simulator genre, allowing you to build and create anything your imagination can cook up. Of course, not everything is handed to you, as you'll have to venture out into the world to explore the various towns and other environments. Everywhere in Palia is teeming with life, and you'll even meet other players in the various hub areas, or you can visit them at the home they've built. Palia also offers plenty of lore that you learn as you explore, making it feel like you're a part of a real community.",

    "fullText": "The National Weather Service has issued a number of warnings as strong winds and heavy snow are expected to hit this weekend.\n\n\"A strong Bering Sea low pressure will bring strong winds, heavy snow, and blizzard conditions to Southwest Alaska beginning on Sunday morning. While conditions improve for most areas on Monday, hazardous winter weather will linger into Tuesday near Lake Iliamna and the Western Alaska Range,\" the NWS revealed.\n\nA high wind warning is in effect for parts of Alaska starting from Sunday morning through Monday as the state braces for winds up to 115 mph. A high wind warning is issued when an area is hit with sustained winds over 60 mph.\n\n\"Take Action! Sustained, strong winds with even stronger gusts are happening. Seek shelter. If you are driving, keep both hands on the wheels and slow down,\" the NWS said.\n\nWhile parts of the state brace for extremely dangerous winds, other parts of the state will start to receive heavy snowfall on Sunday afternoon. \"Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 12 and 24 inches, with localized amounts up to 30 inches from Port Alsworth to Iliamna. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph. Visibility reduced to one half mile or less at times,\" the NWS revealed.\n\n\"Snow will develop by Sunday afternoon and continue through Monday before tapering off to snow showers by Monday evening. Areas of stronger winds, especially around Lake Iliamna, may produce blowing snow that could significantly reduce visibility.\"\n\nIn the event of a strong wind event, the National Weather Service warned residents to stay inside.\n\n\"Immediately go inside a sturdy building during a high wind warning or severe thunderstorm warning and move to an interior room or basement,\" it said. \"If you are in a mobile home, move to a sturdy building before the winds pick up or the storm system reaches your location.\"",

    "fullText": "Over the last several days, the National Weather Service has done a great job detailing the various winter storm warnings that have deeply affected many people. While that is an extremely useful service that the agency provides, they do a lot more than report on snowfall and heavy winds.\n\nToday, the National Weather Service has reported on a major earthquake that has hit and revealed whether it is believed that it will create any tsunamis. Other reports have revealed that the earthquake struck a heavily populated area, which is always an important factor in determining how impactful an earthquake becomes. It is also notable that reports state that several landslides have been caused by the earthquake\n\nOn January 2, 2025, the National Weather Service issued a report detailing a 6.5 magnitude earthquake that had struck Southern Mexico. That report stated that the earthquake struck at 5:58 a.m. Pacific Standard Time at a depth of 6 miles underground near the coast of Guerrero, Mexico. The report also stated that the earthquake took place at the coordinates of 16.8 North and 99.3 West.\n\nA website published by Michigan Tech University details how serious a 6.5 magnitude earthquake can be. According to the website, an earthquake that falls within a 6.1 to 6.9 magnitude range, \"may cause a lot of damage in very populated areas.\"\n\nFortunately, the National Weather Service's report about the 6.5 magnitude earthquake states that there was no danger of a tsunami hitting the United States' West Coast, Alaska, or British Columbia. Furthermore, the report stated that based on past events that were similar, they didn't believe any Tsunamis would occur due to this earthquake. \"Based on earthquake information and historic tsunami records, the earthquake is not expected to generate a tsunami.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of Mexico's earthquake that struck on January 2nd, 2025, Newsweek published an article detailing its effects. That article stated that the earthquake had struck near Acapulco, a heavily populated tourist attraction. An ABC Eye Witness News 7 report published in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake detailed how residents of and tourists to the area were affected.\n\nMost importantly, the report detailed the fact that Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum had stated that no serious damage had been reported. Sheinbaum made that statement after speaking to Guerrero's Governor, Evelyn Salgado, who'd given her that news. However, the ABC report stated that Mexico's Civil Defense Agency had revealed that several landslides had been reported around Acapulco, including on highways in the state.\n\nOf course, details of the consequences of a 6.5 magnitude earthquake can change over time as more information can sometimes come to light. On top of that, it can take time for some damage to become obvious, and aftershocks can also change the dynamics.",

    "description": "An equipment outage and flooded roadways led to significant travel disruption at San Diego Airport, affecting over 300 flights.",
    "fullText": "Thousands of people flying into or out of San Diego on New Year's Day had their travel plans disrupted after a rainstorm hit the city.\n\nData from Flightradar24 showed 40 flights headed for San Diego International Airport decided to land elsewhere on January 1.\n\nThere were enough diversions that air traffic control activated a recovery tool to help planes reach their intended destinations.\n\nAnother 53 flights into or out of the airport were canceled, plus nearly 270 were delayed, according to data from FlightAware.\n\nThat meant around 40% of the flights were behind schedule.\n\nA spokesperson for the Federal Aviation Administration told Business Insider it slowed inbound flights \"due to poor visibility and weather conditions,\" and to perform maintenance on an instrument landing system's glide slope.\n\nA glide slope emits a radio signal that helps planes approach a runway from the correct angle and location, which is particularly useful in bad weather or at night.\n\nAn air traffic control advisory also said the disruption was due to an\"equipment outage.\"\n\nIn a post on X, the airport said the weather was causing flight delays, with some nearby roads closed due to flooding. The airport did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside local working hours.\n\nSan Diego is the third-busiest airport in California. It reported handling over 25 million passengers in 2024.\n\nWhile many of the diverted flights eventually made it to San Diego, it was likely a frustrating day for many travellers.\n\nJapan Airlines Flight 66 had flown about 10 hours from Tokyo to San Diego. After circling around the airport, it diverted to Los Angeles, a 30-minute flight away.\n\nJust over two hours later, the Boeing 787 took off again and completed the short flight down to San Diego.\n\nThe airline didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSome Southwest Airlines passengers departing Sacramento had a two-hour flight to nowhere. Flight 3138 spent an hour circling north of Los Angeles before returning to its origin, per flight-tracking data. It later took off again and reached San Diego about five hours behind schedule.\n\nWhile most flights were able to divert elsewhere in California, around a dozen of them diverted to Phoenix.\n\nA Southwest flight from Baltimore spent about an hour circling just west of the Arizona state capital before touching down there.\n\nIt was on the ground for over three hours before continuing on to San Diego, landing roughly five hours later than planned.\n\nA Southwest spokesperson said the airline canceled about 20 flights and diverted some others that later arrived in San Diego.\n\n\"Nothing is more important to Southwest than the safety of our customers and employees,\" they added.\n\nTwo private jets, flying from Colorado ski resorts, didn't have to divert too far — they were the only ones able to land at McClellan-Palomar Airport in northern San Diego County, per Flightradar24.",

    "description": "The Stannard Rock Lighthouse sits atop an underwater mountain in Lake Superior, marking a reef area that's dangerous for freighters and other boat traffic.",
    "fullText": "LAKE SUPERIOR, MI - A remote Michigan lighthouse sitting far offshore in Lake Superior has recorded one of today’s highest wind gusts amid a severe winter storm and blizzard conditions across the Upper Peninsula.\n\nWeather equipment on the Stannard Rock Lighthouse recorded a wind gust of 69 mph this morning. According to lists compiled by the National Weather Service, it’s the third-highest gust recorded so far during this storm. The highest gusts have been recorded as 72 mph in Sault Ste. Marie and 70 mph at Ford River near Escanaba.\n\nThe historic Stannard Rock Lighthouse sits off the eastern shore of Michigan’s Keweenaw Peninsula. Today, a Gale Warning has been issued for those Lake Superior waters until later tonight. Wind gusts as high as 57 mph are possible today, amid waves reaching 25 feet.\n\nBuilt 24 miles from the Upper Peninsula shoreline, Stannard Rock is considered the lighthouse farthest from shore in the contiguous United States. That has earned it the grim moniker as “The Loneliest Place in the World.”\n\nHistory of “The Loneliest Place in the World.”\n\nBuilt in 1883, the Stannard Rock station is well-known among Great Lakes lighthouse lore lovers. Its exposed crib - or base structure - is considered one of the Top 10 engineering feats in the U.S., according to the National Park Service. And it was built to mark a huge underwater reef that was considered one of the most dangerous obstacles to shipping in Lake Superior. The top of a large underwater mountain was found to sit just 4 feet from the surface of the water in some spots.\n\nHere’s a little more history to give you a feel for this place, courtesy of a social media post from the U.S. Coast Guard Station Marquette:\n\n“The old keepers told terrible tales of life on the Rock. Violent northwest storms sent 30-foot waves smashing into the tower and spray cascading over the lantern room 110 feet above the Lake. Louis Wilks from Marquette holds the record for consecutive time spent on the Rock – 99 days. No other keeper even approached this remarkable feat. The men were rotated off the Rock, three weeks on and one off. In 1939, the U.S. Coast Guard took over the lighthouse and overwhelming loneliness remained a problem.”\n\nThe lighthouse was automated in 1962, a year after a fatal fire and explosion that left survivors stranded at Stannard Rock for days until they were noticed by a passing ship. In 1971, the lighthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIt remains a working aid to navigation. While the lighthouse is closed to the public, it can be seen by boat or airplane.\n\nIf emergency repairs are needed in the winter, the U.S Coast Guard will use a helicopter to fly a team to the lighthouse.\n\nDetroit Forecast: Arctic cold and more snow ahead\n\n2 more rounds of lake effect snow before New Year’s Day\n\nNearly 100,000 remain without power across Michigan after one-two punch of ice, high winds",

    "fullText": "BUFFALO, N.Y. (WIVB) — Western New York’s latest winter storm has prompted Gov. Kathy Hochul to issue an advisory to caution commuters to stay off the roads and work from home if they can Monday.\n\nWith whiteout conditions expected at times along with wind gusts projected to reach upwards of 75 miles per hour — as well as the potential for flooding — Gov. Hochul is urging anyone who can to stay off the roads Monday evening, especially during the evening rush hour commute.\n\nWIVB News 4 was able to speak with Gov. Hochul on Sunday evening over the phone, where she also encouraged Western New Yorkers who can to work from home and avoid going out on the roadways.\n\n“Western New Yorkers, myself included, we think we’re tough, we can handle anything, but when you’re on the roads and there’s 50, 60, 70 mile-an-hour winds and the wind is blowing, it is a dangerous condition. And we want to encourage people if you can, stay off the roads, especially during tomorrow night’s commute from 4 to 7,” Gov. Hochul told News 4. “Just over the next couple of days if you can work remotely or stay home with the kids, forget returning that one item to the store that you don’t like for Christmas, you can do that later, just help us keep the roads clear. Stay home, stay safe.”\n\nAhead of the worst of the storm Monday, Gov. Hochul emphasized how her administration will continue to coordinate with local leaders to help keep Western New Yorkers safe from what’s expected to be, at times, a very severe winter weather event for parts of our area.\n\nA state of emergency that was declared by Gov. Hochul on Friday for more than half of New York’s counties remains in effect headed into Monday in anticipation of the worst of the storm.\n\nA flood watch has also been issued for parts of Western New York, as a slight risk of excessive rainfall is possible as a result of the storm. One to two inches of rain could cause flooding around rivers, creeks, streams and other low-lying areas.\n\nParts of Western New York could see between 1 and 2 feet of snow with this system, combined with high winds and cold temperatures. Snowfall rates of up to two inches an hour and strong winds will create significant blowing and drifting snow and near whiteout conditions in lake-effect areas.\n\nState and local leaders continue to coordinate ahead of the worst of the storm, taking steps to close certain highways where conditions could be very dangerous and life-threatening.\n\n“New Yorkers should monitor local forecasts and take caution to avoid travel in impacted areas,” Gov. Hochul said in a statement. “Plow crews, emergency management teams and utility personnel have been deployed and are ready to keep New Yorkers safe throughout the storm.”\n\nBeginning at 6 a.m. on Monday morning until further notice, an empty tractor trailer and tandem ban will be taking place on the following state highways in Western New York:\n\nI-90 (Thruway Authority Section from Exit 46 to the PA Line both east and westbound)\n\nI-990 (I-90 to State Route 263 Millersport Highway)\n\nRoute 400 (I-90 to State Route 16)\n\nRoute 219 (I-90 to State Route 39)\n\nThe City of Buffalo on Monday morning issued a travel advisory, effective immediately. The advisory was issued due to gusty winds combined with incoming snow creating “extreme whiteout conditions, reduced visibility, and hazardous travel conditions.”\n\n“City officials urge residents to avoid unnecessary travel, use caution if travel is required, and allow additional time to reach destinations,” the advisory said. “The City will continue to monitor weather conditions and provide updates as needed. Residents are encouraged to stay informed by signing up for BuffAlert, the City of Buffalo’s emergency notification system.”\n\nFor real-time travel information, motorists should call 511 or visit www.511NY.org, New York State’s official traffic and travel information source.\n\nRob Petree is an anchor and reporter who joined the News 4 team in 2025.

    "title": "'Onyx Storm' left readers with lots of unanswered questions. Here's everything Rebecca Yarros has said about the 4th 'Empyrean' book so far.",
    "description": "Rebecca Yarros released \"Onyx Storm\" in January 2025, but readers are already looking forward to the next book in the \"Fourth Wing\" universe.",
    "fullText": "It's been nearly a year since Rebecca Yarros released \"Onyx Storm,\" and fans are growing increasingly desperate for dragon rider Violet Sorrengail's story to continue.\n\n\"Onyx Storm\" was the third book in Yarros' \"Empyrean\" series, following \"Fourth Wing\" and \"Iron Flame.\" It centers on Violet's journey to become a dragon rider and fight forces of dark magic at Basgiath War College. The series is set to have five novels when it is complete, all of which will be published by Entangled's fantasy imprint, Red Tower.\n\n\"Onyx Storm\" — the fastest-selling adult novel released in 20 years, according to The New York Times — ended on a cliffhanger, so Yarros' readers have been clamoring to get their hands on the next romantasy novel in the series since the moment they finished book three.\n\nYarros has yet to start writing the next \"Empyrean\" novel, but she has offered clues about book four.\n\nThe rest of this article has spoilers for the \"Empyrean\" series.\n\nYarros released the first three books in the \"Empyrean\" series in under two years. \"Fourth Wing\" came out in April 2023, \"Iron Flame\" was released in October 2023, and \"Onyx Storm\" hit shelves in January 2025.\n\nFans shouldn't expect Yarros to write the next series installment at the same pace. Speaking at an engagement in Philadelphia on January 25, 2025, Yarros said she wouldn't commit to a release date for the fourth \"Empyrean\" novel, as she was writing a contemporary novel first.\n\nShe also said she planned to take time off to be with her family before she writes the fourth book.\n\nYarros also told Elle that she intended to rest before returning to writing because the amount of work she did in recent years wasn't good for her mentally or physically, as she has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and POTS.\n\nYarros stayed true to her word, sharing photos of herself on vacation with her family on Instagram in the months after \"Onyx Storm\" was released. Then, in June 2025, she shared that she had started writing her next contemporary novel. She also shared a photo of the office in her new home, which has a large portrait of a scene from \"Fourth Wing\" and a fireplace with dragon sculptures built into it.\n\nOn December 8, 2025, Yarros provided another update on the status of the fourth \"Empyrean\" novel in an Instagram post, saying that the novel was next in her queue after she finishes the contemporary book she is writing.\n\n\"For transparency's sake… I'm currently working on a contracted contemporary, and once I'm done, I'll be living in the Empyrean world,\" she wrote in the caption of her post. \"I can't wait for you guys to see what I have in store for you!\"\n\nMany fans are finding it particularly difficult to wait for the next \"Empyrean\" novel because of the ending of \"Onyx Storm.\"\n\nAt the end of the book, Xaden used more of his venin power, giving into the dark side of his transition; another unnamed dragon rider turned venin; Andarna returned to Violet after her time away with the irids; and Violet woke up with a wedding ring and blessing of her marriage to Xaden from the goddess Dunne with no memory of the last 12 hours of her life. In the book's final line, her fellow rider Imogen reveals she used her signet power to wipe Violet's memory of the night — at her request.\n\nViolet's brother, Brennan, also revealed that six dragon eggs and four riders, including Xaden and his best friend, Garrick Tavis, are missing.\n\nHopefully, the fourth book in the \"Empyrean\" series will reveal what happened between Violet and Xaden, where Xaden and the other missing riders are, the location of the missing eggs, what Andarna learned from her time with the irids, and how Xaden's additional use of his venin powers harmed his soul.\n\nLikewise, Violet will likely still be searching for a cure to turning venin to bring Xaden back, but as his wife, she also becomes the Duchess of Tyrrendor. She will have new power and responsibility in his absence, and readers will have to wait to see how she balances her new role while developing her signets.\n\nYarros went on an \"Onyx Storm\" book tour after the book was released in January 2025, offering some insight into the future of the series as she connected with fans.\n\nFor instance, at an event in Los Angeles on January 21, 2025, Yarros said, \"Someone you love won't make it in book four.\" That comment isn't that surprising, as beloved characters have died in each installment of the series. However, Yarros got more specific with her hints as her book tour continued.\n\nAt an event in St. Louis on January 31, 2025, Yarros shared that readers have more to discover about the isles Violet explores in \"Onyx Storm.\" When host Lexi Ryan asked her why there was no map of the isles included in \"Onyx Storm,\" Yarros said it \"was deemed to be too spoilery\" by her editorial team, suggesting Violet doesn't know all she will about the isles by the end of book three.\n\nThen, speaking at an event in Denver on February 2, 2025, Yarros shared clues about who Xaden's new venin brother could be.\n\n\"I would pay attention to who's missing at the end,\" she said. \"I would pay attention to someone who feels like whatever they have given is not enough, which is always the case when you turn venin.\"\n\nFans think Xaden's cousin Bodhi Durran, Garrick, or even Violet's brother Brennan could fit that description at the end of \"Onyx Storm.\"\n\nYarros also discussed a plot device she uses that may have consequences for the series. After riders bond a dragon at threshing at Basgiath, the rider announces the dragon's name to the Scribes so it can be recorded. However, Yarros pointed out to fans that the dragons never speak their name to the Scribes directly. It's possible some riders don't share their real names or that dragons lie to their riders, which could help the children of rebels bond dragons their relatives previously bonded, giving them second signet powers. The potential for faux dragon identities could also have other ramifications for the series.\n\nSpeaking more on signet powers in Denver, Yarros said readers had only seen \"like 10%\" of Violet's dream-walking abilities, in part because others who developed the power would have been killed, making it difficult for Violet to learn how to use the signet.\n\n\"There's probably one person alive that can train her,\" Yarros said, though she gave no information about who that person is.\n\nShe also said Xaden's inntinnsic signet has only reached \"like 50%\" of its potential, so his abilities will likely grow in book four.\n\nIn addition, Yarros revealed at the Los Angeles Festival of Books in April 2025 that she has a title picked out for the fourth book, though she didn't say what it was.\n\nOn October 24, 2025, Yarros appeared at Romantasy Bookcon in Orlando, hosted by Fabled Fantasy Events. She spoke with the hosts of the \"Fantasy Fangirls\" podcast, Lexi Ayala and Nicole Holleman, about the \"Empyrean\" series, and Yarros offered hints and sneak peeks at book four.\n\nFor instance, Yarros discussed how the dramatic ending of \"Onyx Storm\" will impact the next book, telling Ayala and Holleman that readers will know what happened to Violet during her 12 missing hours by the novel's end.\n\nLikewise, when the duo asked Yarros about a scene she was excited to write in the next \"Empyrean\" novel, she said, \"I'm really excited to write the moment Violet realizes why Xaden married her. That I am pumped for.\"\n\nOf course, Xaden loves Violet, but considering he had turned venin and the marriage would give Violet political power as the Duchess of Tyrrendor, there is likely more to their union than meets the eye.\n\nYarros also warned that readers \"should really be prepared in book four to see Xaden enter his villain era,\" indicating his marriage to Violet won't stop him from going full venin in the next \"Empyrean\" novel.\n\nThe \"Fantasy Fangirls\" also asked Yarros if Imogen had been wiping Violet's memories at other times in the \"Empyrean\" series, which many readers had been wondering after the ending of \"Onyx Storm.\" Rather than giving a direct answer, Yarros said, \"I think it depends on what you believe of Imogen's character. What has Imogen shown you of her character? What has she told Violet about her signet?\"\n\nIn the \"Empyrean\" series, readers only see Imogen wipe memories when Violet or Xaden specifically ask her to do so. However, much of the series is only told from Violet's limited perspective, so there may have been occasions when Imogen wiped people's memories without Violet's knowledge.\n\nLikewise, Yarros addressed some of her readers' concerns surrounding Bodhi, as there is a contingent of \"Empyrean\" fans who think Xaden's cousin has feelings for Violet, saying, \"Bodhi has a thing for what Xaden has. But he doesn't want to.\"\n\nHer response indicates that Bodhi may be jealous of Xaden rather than in love with Violet. And considering he is one of the potential candidates to have turned venin at the end of \"Onyx Storm,\" Yarros' response is particularly eyebrow-raising.\n\nYarros also gave some hints about the structure of the next book, telling Ayala and Holleman that she plans to offer multiple points of view in the narration of book four. She even specified that some portion of the book will be told from Sloane Mairi's perspective.\n\nFinally, Yarros told readers to pay attention to the black dragons in the \"Empyrean\" series, encouraging them to ask themselves why there are so few black dragons in the world, adding that it's \"very relevant\" that two new baby black dragons hatched in \"Iron Flame.\"\n\nIt will still be a while until the next \"Empyrean\" book is published, but hopefully Yarros' clues can tide readers over while they wait. In the meantime, they can read other romantasy novels to make the wait a bit more bearable.",

    "fullText": "Staying warm and off the road is better than Ezra\n\nAs Winter Storm Ezra intensifies across the central and eastern United States, the freight industry faces a severe threat from high winds that could blow over trailers, disrupting operations and endangering drivers. The storm, which began escalating on Sunday, is unleashing gusts of 50+ mph in parts of the Upper Midwest, with impacts stretching east of Interstate 35, according to real-time data from SONAR Critical Events. SONAR is actively monitoring the situation, providing critical insights to assess and mitigate the storm’s impact on the freight market as conditions worsen.\n\nHigh winds are a massive hazard for truckers, as their trailers become kites in 40+mph winds. \n\nThis can happen on the highway, right next to you as you drive with your family. You can become a victim of a trailer being blown over. \n\nExercise extra caution this week in highways… https://t.co/fWAw5ufbZo\n\n(@FreightAlley) December 29, 2025\n\nHigh Winds Turn Trailers into Hazards, Urging Drivers to Stay Home\n\nSONAR Critical Events has issued high wind alerts for regions east of I-35, with gusts of 50+ mph reported in the Upper Midwest. The platform is tracking an extratropical cyclone set to impact the U.S. and Canada from 2:00 AM EST on December 29 through 3:00 AM EST on December 30, offering freight operators data to navigate potential market disruptions. Winds exceeding 40 mph pose a critical risk, turning truck trailers into kite-like structures vulnerable to rollovers—especially on highways with dense traffic in the Midwest.\n\nThis hazard threatens not only freight movement but also the safety of drivers and other road users. SONAR’s data highlights “High Road Danger” conditions across states like Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, and the Northeast, as well as Canadian provinces like Ontario and Quebec, where road obstructions, collisions, and closures are already emerging. Truck drivers are strongly urged to stay home if possible to avoid these life-threatening risks as the storm peaks Monday.\n\nSONAR Critical Events: Monitoring Wind Impacts on Freight Stability\n\nSONAR’s real-time monitoring provides a detailed wind forecast to help the freight industry prepare. The latest update includes:\n\nWind Gusts: Ranging from 30 to 45 mph, with maxima reaching 50 mph, particularly in the Upper Midwest, where Michigan’s Upper Peninsula has already seen gusts exceeding 65 km/h (40 mph).\n\nImpact Areas: States east of I-35, including the Great Lakes region and Northeast, are under close watch as SONAR evaluates potential delays and cost increases.\n\nMarket Implications: The combination of strong winds and blowing snow reduces visibility and increases the likelihood of trailer rollovers, potentially driving up insurance costs and shipment delays.\n\nSONAR’s advanced mapping tools enable logistics managers to identify high-risk lanes where staying off the road is the safest option. The platform’s recommendation to avoid driving aligns with efforts to protect drivers and stabilize freight operations during the storm’s height.\n\nIndustry Response and Preparedness\n\nWinter Storm Ezra’s rapid intensification has SONAR on high alert, with enhanced collaboration with WeatherOptics delivering hyperlocal wind insights to help carriers adjust schedules and mitigate market instability. SONAR is also tracking lake-effect snow driven by these winds, with potential accumulations up to 60 cm (24 inches) along Lake Superior’s south shore, which could further disrupt cross-border freight from Canada. The focus remains on keeping trailers upright, with drivers encouraged to stay home if their routes fall within these danger zones.\n\nLooking Ahead: SONAR’s Ongoing Analysis Through Tuesday\n\nAs the Arctic air mass fueling Ezra interacts with warmer southern air, SONAR predicts the storm’s wind-driven impacts, including trailer rollover risks, will persist through Tuesday. The platform is continuously analyzing high road danger conditions and potential shipment delays affecting tens of millions across the Plains to the Northeast.\n\nLogistics managers should leverage SONAR Critical Events for updates, preparing for extended transit times on east-west routes where crosswinds are most severe. The clear message to truck drivers: stay home if possible to avoid the devastating impact of a trailer blown over by gusts. This real-time intelligence is crucial for optimizing freight market resilience.\n\nFreightWaves will continue to track Winter Storm Ezra’s progression, relying on SONAR’s monitoring to keep the industry informed. With winds threatening to topple trailers across the eastern U.S., safety and strategic planning are paramount. Stay tuned for further developments as the storm unfolds.\n\nThe post Truckers east of I-35 advised to stay home appeared first on FreightWaves.",

Blizzard conditions are likely, resulting in dangerous travel conditions and scattered power outages across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes Omaha into Monday. Heavy lake-effect snow is expected on westerly flow from Lakes Erie and Ontario Monday afternoon into Tuesday,\" the NWS warned.\n\nWhile the NWS map shows areas of the country receiving 18 inches of snow, some meteorologists are predicting up to 36 inches of snow in some areas.\n\nIn addition to the massive snow accumulation, the NWS warned of strong winds and dangerously cold temperatures, as well.\n\n\"Wind gusts in excess of 40 mph and bitterly cold temperatures spilling south from Canada will lead sub-zero wind chills into Monday. Dangerously cold wind chills as cold as -30°F are likely in North Dakota and northern Minnesota,\" the NWS warned.\n\nAs a result of these extreme conditions that have persisted throughout the season, the NWS has continually urged anyone in the area to stay indoors as much as possible, especially amid the sub-zero wind chills and strong winds.\n\n“Cold outside? Avoid the risk of frostbite and hypothermia by dressing in layers, covering exposed skin, and limiting time outdoors,” the NWS wrote in a post on X earlier this month. “If someone might be experiencing either condition, seek medical attention immediately — and know your actions.”\n\nThis type of severe winter weather is especially dangerous for newborns, the elderly, those with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, and unhoused individuals, the NWS warned.\n\n“Everyone is at risk from the dangers of extreme cold, but these groups are more vulnerable than most. Age and certain conditions make the body less able to regulate temperature,” the NWS warns.\n\nThe NWS advised people to limit time outside, but to wear loose layers and cover all skin if they do have to venture outdoors. Additionally, the NWS advises people to consume hot foods and warm drinks, but avoid caffeine and alcohol.\n\nIn addition to urging everyone to stay indoors and out of the elements as much as possible, the NWS has also warned against even attempting to try to travel in these extreme conditions.\n\nThe NWS has issued a blizzard warning for parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin, warning of \"dangerous\" and \"potentially life-threatening\" travel conditions. In those areas, the NWS warned to avoid travel altogether.\n\nOther areas are in a winter storm warning rather than a more severe blizzard warning. In those areas, the NWS still urges people to reconsider and limit their travels and to expect \"considerable travel problems.\"\n\nIf travel is absolutely necessary, the NWS urges travelers to be prepared with some emergency items like a cell phone charger, a flashlight, a first aid kit, jumper cables, road flares, tire chains or snow tires, water and snacks, a full tank of gas, a bag of sand or cat litter, a shovel, an ice scraper, a tow rope, water and snacks, and warm clothing and blankets.\n\n\"You never know when you will encounter winter weather or an emergency road closure,\" the NWS warns.",

    "fullText": "More than 60 million people across the U.S. are under winter weather alerts as a powerful storm system targets the Northeast after Christmas, while a separate atmospheric river continues to batter California with flooding rain, high winds and dangerous conditions.\n\nForecasters warn the systems could disrupt flights and road travel as millions of Americans head home after the holidays.\n\nThe severe weather is expected to unfold over several days, with impacts stretching from the West Coast to the Northeast. Forecasters say conditions on the ground could change quickly, affecting everything from short drives to long-distance travel. Here’s what to know about the most affected regions.\n\nThe tristate area is expected to bear the brunt of a major winter storm on Friday, with snow, sleet and freezing rain forecast to create hazardous travel conditions. Accumulating snow is forecast to hit New York, Connecticut and New Jersey — where a state of emergency has been declared — beginning Friday through early Saturday. Some forecast models suggest that parts of New York and New Jersey will see up to 9 inches of snow, depending on the storm’s track.\n\nThe storm is already disrupting air travel in the region. As of Friday morning, at least 1,300 flights across the U.S. had been canceled, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware, with delays expected to grow as the storm intensifies.\n\nSnowfall totals of roughly 1 to 6 inches are expected across northeastern Pennsylvania, much of New Jersey, large portions of New York state and parts of southern and central New England, with higher amounts possible in elevated areas north and west of New York City.\n\nThe system is also expected to bring sleet and freezing rain to parts of Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia and northern Virginia. A wintry mix is likely in cities including Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C.\n\nOn the West Coast, California is facing dangerous conditions from a powerful atmospheric river system bringing flooding rain, high winds and heavy mountain snow to the state.\n\nWith atmospheric rivers, intense rainfall, and strong winds ahead, I’m declaring a state of emergency in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Shasta counties to activate emergency authorities and preposition resources to keep our communities safe. pic.twitter.com/C3eLImPkwx\n\n— Governor Gavin Newsom (@CAgovernor) December 24, 2025\n\nThe storm has already turned deadly, with at least three deaths reported in Southern California.\n\nParts of Southern California saw record-breaking rainfall earlier this week, with some locations seeing their wettest Christmas Eve or Christmas-week totals in decades.\n\nThe prolonged rainfall has increased the threat of mudslides, particularly in areas recently burned by wildfires. Officials have urged residents to avoid flooded roadways and to be prepared to evacuate if conditions worsen.\n\nAt higher elevations, the same storm system has delivered dangerous winter weather to the Sierra Nevada, making mountain travel hazardous across parts of California and western Nevada.\n\nAvalanche warnings were issued for parts of the Sierra as heavy snow and strong winds created unstable conditions in the mountains. Forecasters say 5 to 10 feet of snow could pile up in some high-elevation areas, significantly increasing avalanche risk and making travel especially dangerous through the weekend.\n\nThe Sierra Avalanche Center has issued a Backcountry Avalanche Watch for the backcountry areas around the Greater Lake Tahoe region as high avalanche danger is expected Thursday.

    "title": "Airlines are canceling flights ahead of a winter storm. Here's what to do if your flight is delayed or canceled.",
    "description": "As a snow storm heads toward the New York City area, airlines are delaying and canceling thousands of flights.",
    "fullText": "A winter storm expected to hit the Northeast is causing thousands of flight delays and cancellations.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued a winter storm warning for areas around New York City, extending into Connecticut and New Jersey. The service expects heavy snow accumulations between six and nine inches.\n\nAbout 1,400 flights in the US have been canceled, as of 2:20 p.m. ET, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware. Over 5,100 US flights have been delayed, per the service.\n\nAffected travel hubs, including New York's John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia, and Newark Liberty airports, have begun issuing weather warnings.\n\nSome airlines have begun offering solutions to travelers affected by the storm. JetBlue, Delta, and Southwest have all waived fare differences for those changing flights from airports around the New York metropolitan area.\n\nThe delays and cancellations come during a high-density travel period around the winter holiday. AAA projected that 8.03 million Americans would fly domestically between December 20 and January 1.\n\nHere is the best advice for what to do if your flight is disrupted.\n\nAccording to the Department of Transportation, there is no law requiring US airlines to compensate passengers for disruptions caused by uncontrollable events, such as weather. That also includes air traffic control delays.\n\nThe only rule carriers must follow is to refund customers in the event of cancellations, even for non-controllable events. And that does not mean travel credits or vouchers — it must be cash, and includes any add-ons, such as bags or seats.\n\nBut carriers do not owe meals, hotel rooms, or financial compensation for storm-related cancellations or delays — because the cause is the weather, not the airline.\n\nPassengers are still entitled to a refund or rebooking on the same airline, but carriers are not required to provide additional accommodations or rebook on another airline.\n\nIf you choose to travel but your flight is delayed or canceled, ask the airline for the reason — ideally in writing — so you know what you're entitled to. Airlines have different policies for disruptions they control, like crew or maintenance issues.\n\nThe DoT's Airline Customer Service Dashboard — launched in 2022 — shows what the 10 largest US airlines promise in those cases, including rebookings, meal vouchers, and hotel accommodations.\n\nWhen a flight delay or cancellation is announced, expect people to flock to the nearest customer service line for assistance, and for the phone lines to clog.\n\nWait times can be painfully long, and the best alternatives will likely go quickly. However, some airlines offer the option to rebook on their website or mobile app and waive any fees, making it sometimes easier to make changes online than in person.\n\nIf all available options are exhausted, have a plan B, such as waiting to speak with a live agent, contacting the airline through social media, or booking a hotel for the night.\n\nDirect messaging on Facebook or Twitter can actually serve as a virtual placeholder, and you may hear back via chat before speaking to a live agent.\n\nHere are the phone numbers for each airline:\n\nFor controllable delays or cancellations that result in a customer waiting at least three hours for a new flight or requiring an overnight stay, several airlines will offer meal or hotel vouchers.\n\nCarriers offering both are Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, and United Airlines, per the DoT dashboard.\n\nFrontier Airlines is the only carrier that does not offer accommodations in the event of an overnight delay or cancellation, but it will provide a meal voucher.\n\nFor US airlines not listed on the dashboard, or in cases where the disruption is uncontrollable (like because of a winter storm), or if the compensation is unclear, simply ask.\n\nIt never hurts to request a meal or hotel during flight disruptions, and you might get lucky with a goodwill gesture from the carrier.\n\nSeveral major banks offer credit cards that come with travel insurance, like Chase's Sapphire Reserve or American Express' Platinum Card. Both offer trip protection, meaning customers who purchased their flight with that specific card can reap the benefits.\n\nFor example, in the case of a major storm system, it's likely many passengers will end up stranded in random cities across the US.\n\nHowever, banks with travel insurance included can reimburse cardholders for unexpected expenses outside their control, including hotel, meal, and transportation costs.\n\nTravel insurance does not apply in all circumstances, like short delays, so be sure to check your policy before making a claim — but it also doesn't hurt to make the claim anyway, even if the answer is no.\n\nDuring the holidays, it's easy to lose sight of your purpose — seeing friends and family or simply getting away from home for a few days.\n\nHowever, delays and cancellations are inevitable. Don't spend all day sitting around waiting — give yourself a cut-off time. Once that moment passes, consider alternative means of getting to your destination, such as driving or taking a bus or train (which may also be covered by travel insurance).\n\nIf you are stuck in another city and have no other option but to stay in a hotel or wait at the airport, decide how you want to spend your time and make a plan.\n\nEditor's note: This article was originally published in 2023 and has been updated.",

    "fullText": "WRIGHTWOOD, Calif. (AP) — A strong storm system that brought relentless winds, rain and snowfall to California this week was expected to ease Friday, but there was still a risk of high surf along the coast, flash flooding near Los Angeles and avalanches in the Sierra Nevada.\n\nWaves near the San Francisco Bay Area could reach up to 25 feet (7.6 meters) Friday, parts of Southern California were at risk of flooding, and avalanches could hit the Lake Tahoe area, officials warned. Residents were told to be ready to evacuate the mountain town of Wrightwood about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northeast of Los Angeles because of mudslides.\n\nAtmospheric rivers carried massive plumes of moisture from the tropics during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year. The storms were blamed for at least two deaths earlier in the week.\n\nThe system brought the wettest Christmas season to downtown Los Angeles in 54 years, the National Weather Service said.\n\nRoads in the 5,000-resident town of Wrightwood were covered in rocks, debris and thick mud on Thursday. With power out, a gas station and coffee shop running on generators were serving as hubs for residents and visitors.\n\n“It’s really a crazy Christmas,” said Jill Jenkins, who was spending the holiday with her 13-year-old grandson, Hunter Lopiccolo.\n\nLopiccolo said the family almost evacuated the previous day, when water washed away a chunk of their backyard. But they decided to stay and still celebrated the holiday. Lopiccolo got a new snowboard and e-bike.\n\n“We just played card games all night with candles and flashlights,” he said.\n\nDavey Schneider hiked a mile and a half (1.6 kilometers) through rain and floodwater up to his shins from his Wrightwood residence Wednesday to rescue cats from his grandfather’s house.\n\n“I wanted to help them out because I wasn’t confident that they were going to live,” Schneider said Thursday. “Fortunately, they all lived. They’re all okay — just a little bit scared.”\n\nArlene Corte said roads in town turned into rivers, but her house was not damaged.\n\n“It could be a whole lot worse,” she said. “We’re here talking.”\n\nWith more rain on the way, more than 150 firefighters were stationed in the area, said San Bernardino County Fire spokesman Shawn Millerick.\n\n“We’re ready,” he said. “It’s all hands on deck at this point.”\n\nA falling tree killed a San Diego man Wednesday, news outlets reported. Farther north, a Sacramento sheriff’s deputy died in what appeared to be a weather-related crash.\n\nAreas along the coast, including Malibu, were under a flood watch until Friday afternoon, and wind and flood advisories were issued for much of the Sacramento Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nSouthern California typically gets half an inch to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 centimeters) of rain this time of year, but this week many areas could see between 4 and 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters), with even \n\nMore wind and heavy snow was expected in the Sierra Nevada, where gusts created “near white-out conditions” and made mountain pass travel treacherous.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom declared emergencies in six counties to allow state assistance.\n\nThe state deployed resources and first responders to several coastal and Southern California counties, and the California National Guard was on standby.",

In Philadelphia, you can expect a mix of sleet and freezing rain with some snow. South Jersey and Delaware will transition to rain at some point overnight Friday.\n\nThe Philly area will start seeing precipitation around 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. on Friday, again moving west to east. Then, models predict the storm will move offshore sometime between 10 a.m. and noon on Saturday.\n\nModels vary about potential snow totals. But in general, forecasters predict between one and two inches of snow in northern Delaware, 1.5–4 inches in the Philadelphia area, and higher snow totals the further north you travel.\n\nPhiladelphia, according to the National Weather Service, has a nearly 30% chance of seeing 4 inches of snow/sleet or more by Satuday morning, with those chances being as high as 63% just 30 miles north in Trenton.\n\nIn addition to snow, experts predict large ice accumulation overnight Friday into Saturday, making streets and sidewalks dangerously slippery.\n\nThe National Weather Service says that people \"should consider delaying all travel\" until after the winter storm is over.\n\n\"If travel is absolutely necessary, drive with extreme caution,\" the NWS said, recommending travelers bring safety kits and other supplies in the event that they get stranded.\n\nInformation in this story is from FOX 29 meteorologist Sue Serio and the National Weather Service.",

Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Shasta counties on Wednesday. Some areas had already received 4 to 8 inches of rain by Wednesday morning, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nAnother wave of the storm was expected to hit on Christmas Day, with flood and wind advisories for \"life-threatening\" storm conditions from the National Weather Service remaining in effect until Thursday afternoon.\n\nOver 163,000 homes and businesses across California were still without power on Christmas morning, according to poweroutage.us.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Redding Police Department reported one storm-related fatality in Northern California.

    "fullText": "It has already been an eventful winter when it comes to winter weather, and it sounds like some parts of the country are expected to get hit hard by some heavy snow and dangerous winds this week.\n\nOn the morning of Wednesday, Dec. 24, the National Weather Service (NWS) issued a series of \"urgent\" Winter Weather warnings for a few regions of the country, warning of incoming snow and wind over the next few hours and days.\n\nThe warnings are especially pertinent for those planning holiday ski trips or hiking trips in some mountain regions.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the NWS issued a winter weather warning for south central, southwest, and western Maine, as well as northern New Hampshire, predicting that those areas could get snowfall reaching up to 14 inches by Wednesday afternoon.\n\n“Periods of moderate and heavy snow will combine with low visibility to create dangerous driving conditions,” the NWS warned in its advisory. “The hazardous conditions could impact the Wednesday morning commute as well as holiday travel.”\n\nThe advisory goes through Wednesday at 1 p.m., and the NWS warns that this could impact holiday travel.\n\n\"If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency,\" the NWS warned.\n\nParts of California, especially those in high elevations in the Yosemite National Park region, are expected to see some heavy snowfall over the next few days, combined with some strong winds.\n\nThe NWS warns that some areas could get between 4 and 8 feet of snow and 60 mph winds, lasting until Friday night, which could cause \"whiteout conditions.\"\n\nOther areas, like the Greater Lake Tahoe area, could get up to two feet of snow (with up to five feet expected above 5,000 feet) and 50 mph winds. Winds up to 100 mph are likely along the top ridges until Friday morning.\n\n“The strong winds and weight of snow on tree limbs may down power lines and could cause sporadic power outages,” the NWS warned in its advisory. “Whiteout conditions are expected and will make travel treacherous and potentially life-threatening. Travel could be very difficult to impossible.”\n\nParts of Idaho are expected to see some heavy winter weather this week, especially those at higher elevations. The NWS warns of several feet of snow and wind gusts of up to 35 miles per hour in some areas of the state through Thursday.\n\n\"Heavy snow expected,\" the NWS wrote in its advisory. \"Total snow accumulations of around 5 inches to 1 foot at elevations 6500 feet to 8000 feet. Above 8000 feet expect 1 to 2 feet of snow. For highest peaks, up to 3 feet of snow is likely. For Galena Summit about 1 foot of snow is expected. Accumulations in Ketchum and Sun Valley will be much lower at 2 inches or less. Winds gusting as high as 35 MPH.\"\n\nObviously, this could make travel difficult during the holiday season.\n\n\"Travel could be very difficult to impossible, mainlyover Galena Summit and in backcountry areas. Expect blowing and drifting snow,\" the NWS warned.",

Road conditions are expected to be slippery, with even hazardous conditions affecting traffic, the NWS wrote in a probabilistic weather forecast.\n\n“New York is no stranger to snow and cold weather, and given the Christmas holidays, it’s important to be extra prepared before getting on the road,” Governor Hochul said. “As always, I urge New Yorkers to monitor their local forecast and text their county or borough name to our weather and emergency alerts system. Stay vigilant, drive slowly if you need to travel, and have a safe holiday weekend.”\n\nThose with travel commitments are encouraged to follow these safety tips.\n\nMonitor the forecast for the area you may be traveling to\n\nMake sure your car is stocked with survival gear like blankets, a shovel, a flashlight and extra batteries, extra warm clothing, a set of tire chains, battery booster cables, quick energy foods, and brightly colored cloth to use as a distress flag\n\nKeep your cell phone battery charged and keep it with you whenever traveling\n\nMatthew Euzarraga is a multimedia journalist from El Paso, Texas.

The release of the Nintendo Switch 2 saw the updated rerelease of Super Mario Party Jamboree along with it. This new title in the beloved digital board game series is packed with over 110 minigames and a roster of 22 characters, so there are more options for people to settle for after the no.1 character, Yoshi, is picked.\n\nRead our review of Super Mario Party Jamboree here\n\nWhen work is slowing down for the holidays, friends are home from school, and it's time to relax and let off some steam, Call of Duty Black Ops 7 is here for you. Whether you want to squad up with that same group you've been playing with since the old days or mowing down some zombies with your cousins or siblings, few games can offer quite the same cathartic gunplay as a new CoD game. And if you instead want to just check out a wild story, then hop into campaign mode, where you can play as Milo Ventimiglia, the actor behind Peter Petrelli from the mid-2000s superhero drama on NBC, Heroes.\n\nRead our review of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 here\n\nWith the cold weather settling in and snow coming down, sometimes it can be nice to settle in for a nice, long comfort RPG, and the new Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D Remake is perfect for those cold nights indoors. Following up on last year's Dragon Quest III Remake, DQ I&II are impressive and expansive retellings of the original games that came out nearly 40 years ago. With classic turn-based combat and a run time that can easily last 70+ hours, Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D pairs perfectly with a soft blanket and a mug of hot chocolate.\n\nRead our review of DQ I&II HD-2D Remake here\n\nFew games this year have garnered quite as much discussion and fervor as Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. If, for some reason, you haven't had a chance yet to play it, this holiday if you have some time off work or school, do yourself a favor and play this game. From its complex world, captivating characters, and an enthralling soundtrack, if you have friends or family who also play games, play this game; it will give you all plenty of things to talk about.\n\nRead our review of Expedition 33 here.\n\nI've never quite understood the idea of Sonic the Hedgehog driving a car when he could run faster than one, but when a game is as fun as Sonic Racing: Crossworld is, those thoughts flow out of my head. Crossworlds is the best classic cart racer this year with exciting tracks, neat vehicle transformations, and a ton of characters -now from worlds and properties outside of Sonic! Gather around your screen for some local split-screen shananigans or play online with 12 players at once for a truly chaotix time.\n\nRead our review of Sonic Racing: Crossworlds here\n\nIf you are looking for more of a cooperative jaunt, one of the best this year is Split Fiction, from Hazelight Studios, the same team behind the also fantastic It Takes Two. Split Fiction is a split-screen adventure where you and another person will work together through a variety of tricky challenges covering all sorts of game genres all under the umbrella of a wonderful tale of friendship. As an added bonus, only one person needs to own a copy of the game as you can invite another player to play with you online using the free Friend's Pass.\n\nRead our review of Split Fiction here.\n\nThere is something to be said about a game where you can play on the couch, losing hours to it, and Ball X Pit is a game that fits that bill. This clever twist on the classic brick-breaking formula is a rougelike indie game where you unlock new adventurers and descend into a pit to defeat menacing monsters by bouncing a wide variety of special spherical projectiles at them. In addition to being able to upgrade and fuse these powerful weapons, you will also unlock new characters to pick from, a small village-building system, and more as you break the walls of the encroaching enemies. Ball X Pit is a master at giving you that \"one more run\" itch.\n\nRead our review of Ball X Pit here\n\nIf you are \n\nRead our review of Blue Prince here\n\nWould you trust your best friends to help you climb a mountain? What about your family? Well, wonder no longer, as, thanks to indie developer Team Peak, you will now be able to do just that (in a safe, non-real-world scenario) with Peak. This cooperative climbing adventure puts you and your friends in a predicament that requires you to scale a tall mountain in order to survive. With cute visuals, proximity chat, climbing items to help you, and more, all helped push Peak to the top of Steam charts this year, and it is a great time to check out while on break this holiday.\n\nCheck out a bit of the history behind Peak here\n\nWhether it's Ultimate, Brawl, Melee, or any of the other variations, I have never attended a gathering that Super Smash Bros. hasn't improved. The chaos of 8-man multiplayer, the tense edge-of-your-seat sudden death matches, and the exultation of come-from-behind wins help keep Smash Brothers from ever getting old. While the world anxiously waits for the word of a Switch 2 Smash, the old versions are just as fun to revisit, so grab some controllers and prepare to fight!\n\nRead our review of Super Smash Bros.

    "fullText": "Before he ever worked in finance, Cardinez thought he'd play professional football. When that didn't happen, he found a way to remain close to the action — interning at Madison Square Garden, joining the 2014 Super Bowl host committee, and completing the NFL's rotational program across media, business development, and strategy.\n\nHe thought he'd stay there and ascend the ranks. But he decided on a different path that seemed to align more with his interests: finance.\n\nAfter earning his MBA and working in investment banking, he joined Blue Owl's HomeCourt Partners, a fund established with the NBA to buy minority stakes in teams.\n\nCardinez has since worked on multiple franchise deals, including the Phoenix Suns' $4 billion sale and a 2024 transaction involving the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nKress' path to high finance began in academic research, studying anthropology and psychology at Notre Dame and conducting fieldwork in Sierra Leone before pursuing graduate work on Angola's energy sector at the University of Oxford. She later worked at political research and consultancy firm, Eurasia Group, training investors to integrate geopolitical risk into decision-making.\n\nKress came to BlackRock first as an advisor to Tom Donilon, the former US national security advisor, a post she called a \"dream job.\" She helped Donilon elevate the firm's geopolitics function into a permanent part of the BlackRock Investment Institute.\n\nBut she didn't stop there. This year, Kress was named the chief of staff to Larry Fink, the firm's powerful CEO. She told Business Insider that this new job was the \"culmination\" of her career, offering \"unparalleled exposure\" to global policymakers and business leaders.\n\nJack Levendoski, JPMorgan Chase\n\nLevendoski grew up all over the world — from Louisiana to London, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Australia — before beginning his career as a facilities engineering project manager at Chevron.\n\nIn that role, he supported offshore oil and gas work in the Gulf of Mexico. Levendoski later moved into investment banking and is now an executive director in JPMorgan's M&A group, advising on high-profile technology and software transactions.\n\nMenasche admits he didn't always feel like a natural fit for the finance industry — he didn't grow up in a household of bankers, he said, and he studied chemistry and math at Cambridge. But after trying academic research, he found the lab's pace too slow. That realization led him to roles that blended analytical work with more day-to-day momentum, eventually steering him into secondaries.\n\nToday, Menasche is a managing director and global cohead of Goldman Sachs' private capital and liquidity solutions group, working across real estate, infrastructure, private equity, and venture capital transactions.\n\nJackie Shepherd, Morgan Stanley\n\nBefore joining the ranks of Wall Street, Shepherd spent years competing in Division I golf, earning a full-ride scholarship and captaining the University of Minnesota's team. She began her career in accounting at EY's international tax practice, where she first encountered investment banking.\n\n\"I didn't realize that there was an intersection between the two,\" she told Business Insider. \"I wanted to be the person coming up with more of the cool ideas.\" So she made the pivot to Wall Street.\n\nAfter holding roles at Goldman Sachs and Citi, she joined Morgan Stanley's separations and structured solutions group. Shepherd has worked on roughly $250 billion in transactions, including Comcast's pending carve-out of its cable networks.\n\nGolf, she said, remains a key part of her life, adding that aspires to play on all seven continents.",

Like a throwback to the good old days under Brendan Rodgers, Ange Postecoglou or even Martin O'Neill.\n\nWith 31 shots on goal, 10 on target and an xG (expected goals) of 4.5, Celtic should have been out of sight. The only thing for supporters to worry about should have been some last-minute Christmas shopping.\n\nBut when Kenan Bilalovic thudded his shot under Kasper Schmeichel to draw 10-man Aberdeen inexplicably level with 16 minutes to remaining, concerns were firmly focused on Nancy again.\n\nSince taking change from O'Neill less than three weeks ago, many fans will have wondered if he realised what he'd walked into.\n\nAnd while Nancy would be forgiven for failing to make sense of Sunday's ridiculous contest, he'll not be given so much leeway if the rays of light on show against Aberdeen don't turn into a full new dawn.",

    "description": "It's almost the end of 2025, and in the spirit of Spotify Wrapped, several big companies have invited subscribers to review their last year of activity. Sony got the ball rolling with the PlayStation Wrap-Up, Steam offers a similar annual roundup, and the Nintendo Switch Year in Review recap has been announced for early next year--but where is Xbox in the middle of all this?\nWhile it doesn't offer an Xbox wrap-up every year, it still feels odd for Microsoft's gaming brand to skip 2025. The year has seen several high-profile releases from the company and the launch of an Xbox-branded handheld gaming PC alongside Asus, but according to Windows Central, Microsoft is allocating its marketing budget toward celebrating several major anniversaries in 2026.\nThe Xbox brand celebrates its 25th anniversary next year, Blizzard has its 35th anniversary to look forward to, and Bethesda is turning 40.",

    "fullText": "Southern California is basking in sunshine and unseasonably warm temperatures this week, but forecasters say a holiday twist is on the way.\n\n“We’re still seeing fog for some coastal spots, but inland areas are warming up above average once again,” KTLA weather anchor Kacey Montoya said Monday, noting highs in the low 80s for the Los Angeles Basin. “It’s about 20 degrees above average today, even warmer tomorrow.”\n\nThe National Weather Service said highs will stay in the low 80s through Thursday before cooling into the 70s by the weekend. Air quality remains moderate for most of the region, with a mandatory wood-burning ban in effect through Tuesday for the South Coast Air Basin.\n\nThe NWS long-range forecast shows a Pacific storm could arrive as early as Dec. 22, with snow levels dropping in mountain communities – potentially complicating holiday travel.\n\n“There is a system that is very likely to bring us some widespread precipitation,” Montoya said. “Models don’t agree on when the rain begins or how much.”\n\nBut meteorologists caution that those hoping for a big boost to ski resorts may be disappointed.\n\n“Next week’s stormy pattern does not appear to be a big snowmaker for our area as the upper level trough will pull in moisture from the southwest initially, then a plume from the south joins in on the fun,” the Weather Service said in a bulletin. “Thus temperatures will remain too warm for any significant snow.”",

    "description": "The historic rally has carried over to the Toronto Stock Exchange, where the mining-heavy materials sector has led the index to record-breaking highs.",
    "fullText": "With many gold stocks cruising towards triple-digit gains in 2025, analysts say next year could be another period of blistering returns for companies mining the yellow metal.\n\nThe gold futures contract for February (GC=F) breached US$4,300 per ounce on Friday, a level not seen since October, when bullion hit an all-time high above US$4,350. This historic rally has carried over to the Toronto Stock Exchange, where the mining-heavy materials sector has led the index to record-breaking highs.\n\nAnalysts at RBC Capital Markets expect gold to average US$4,600 per ounce in 2026, ending the year at approximately US$4,800 per ounce. In 2027, their team, led by the bank’s head of global metals and mining research, sees bullion averaging US$5,100 per ounce.\n\n“Historically, gold producers have behaved pro-cyclically, resulting in sharply higher costs/capital, rising reserve assumptions, and increasing M&A in a rising price environment, which has ultimately eroded investor returns,” Josh Wolfson and his peers wrote in RBC’s latest global precious metals equities outlook.\n\n“Today, producers are operating with a significantly more prudent approach to capital allocation and discretionary spending, and we expect reserves to be calculated at a conservative <US$2,000/oz, less than 50 per cent of current gold prices,” Wolfson added. “Gold producers are experiencing a perfect storm, and are behaving responsibly.”\n\nThat said, RBC describes its outlook on gold stocks as “more conservative than consensus.” The bank expects capital spending to rise, as producers with extra cash look to squeeze returns from existing projects. They also see all-in sustaining costs, a key industry metric, rising by nine per cent in 2026.\n\nAmong the operators, Wolfson and his team say Canadian companies Agnico Eagle (AEM.TO)(AEM), Barrick Mining (ABX.TO)(B), and Kinross Gold (K.TO) have the most downside risk. On the other hand, RBC predicts shares of South Africa-based AngloGold Ashanti (AU) could see “modest upside,” versus its estimates.\n\nExchange-traded fund (ETF) provider Global X says its Gold Producers Index ETF (GLDX.TO) is the top-performing ETF in Canada year-to-date, excluding leveraged funds. The TSX-listed basket of stocks has gained nearly 178 per cent year-to-date. Barrick, AngloGold, and Kinross are its top three holdings.\n\n“Anytime something is up in the triple digits, I would say that probably exceeds expectations,” Chris McHaney, Global X’s head of investment management and strategy, told Yahoo Finance Canada.\n\n“You might see a similar type of return [in 2026]. With the gold price where it is, generally at all-time highs, the gold producers don’t really need the price of gold to continue going up. They just need it to stay relatively where it is, and they’ll be able to make significant cash flows from their operations.”",

    "fullText": "The National Weather Service has been busy over the past few weeks as extreme weather surges across the United States. Record warm temperatures along the West coast brought catastrophic flooding to the region while temperatures continue to plunge in the Midwest and Great Lakes regions as record cold and heavy snowfall dominate the area.\n\nEarlier this week the NWS issued a winter storm warning for several states, but played particular attention to Montana, which is expecting a surge in snowfall.\n\n“For the Winter Storm Warning, heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 6 and 12 inches, with localized amounts approaching 20 inches in the Island Ranges. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph,” the NWS said in a statement.\n\nThe heavy snowfall is expected to hit The Highwood, Little Belt, Judith, and Snowy Mountains, and Southern Rocky Mountain Front, though much of the middle part of the state is in danger of serious weather.\n\nAn interactive map from the National Weather Service shows the percentage change of a storm to exceed the initial warning criteria revealed for the area. Much of Montana sits in a very high probability range that weather will become much more serious than initially predicted, according to the model.\n\nAnother map from the NWS shows regions south of Lewistown, MT are expecting up to 24 inches of snow - or perhaps more as the scale tops out at 24 inches - through Sunday, Dec. 14.\n\nIn addition to a Winter Storm Warning, much of Montana received an Extreme Cold Warning as well, with temperatures dropping to more than 20 degrees below zero.",

    "title": "Winter storm watch issued for Columbus, central Ohio. See when snow will hit",
    "description": "Two winter systems are expected to bring several rounds of accumulating snow to central Ohio beginning tonight and continuing into the weekend.",
    "fullText": "Break out the shovels, your weekend's about to get snowy.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Wilmington has issued a winter storm watch for several central Ohio counties, including Franklin, Licking, Preble, Montgomery, Greene, Fayette, Pickaway, Fairfield and Hocking.\n\nThe advisory issued the afternoon of Dec. 11, which includes Columbus, goes into effect Saturday, Dec. 13 and runs until the morning of Sunday, Dec. 14.\n\nThe watch says that accumulation of 3 to 5 inches is possible and could make travel difficult in parts of east central Indiana and central and west central Ohio.\n\nThere is also a chance of snow overnight and into the early morning of Friday, Dec. 12, with the forecast calling for some snow after 4 a.m.\n\nTwo separate weather systems will bring accumulating snow. First, 2-4 inches of snowfall is expected tonight into Friday morning, with impacts to the morning commute. Next, 2-4 inches of additional accumulation is possible Saturday afternoon into Saturday night. pic.twitter.com/hMLxv7qMy0\n\n— NWS Wilmington OH (@NWSILN) December 11, 2025\n\nNWS alerted these weather conditions in an X post on Dec. 11, explaining \"two separate weather systems will bring accumulating snow.\"\n\nThe NWS says the overnight snow could affect the Dec. 12 morning commute. So, it might be a good idea to leave early for work or school to give yourself time to get to where you're going safely.\n\nThe previous considerable snowstorm snarled traffic, resulted in multiple crashes and led to several school closings and delays across central Ohio.\n\nThe Climate Prediction Center (CPC) confirmed on Dec. 11 that the La Niña weather pattern would continue to impact weather across the country until February 2026.\n\nIn Ohio, La Niña winters mean colder conditions, especially if you live in the northern and eastern parts of the state.\n\nThe strong westerly to northwesterly winds crossing Lake Erie can fuel lake-effect snow along the snowbelt, impacting cities such as Cleveland, Toledo, and Sandusky. If the lake remains ice-free later into the season, as is expected in milder falls, snow events can be more frequent and intense.\n\nSouthern Ohio may not see significant lake-effect snow, but the region can still experience colder-than-average temperatures and occasional heavy snowfall when Arctic air aligns with storm systems.For example, during past La Niña winters, northern Ohio has seen multiple lake-effect snowstorms dropping several feet of snow in just a few days, while southern Ohio experienced sharp cold snaps and scattered snow events — a pattern that reflects the classic La Niña influence on the state.\n\nLa Niña isn't the only weather system influencing winter weather. The polar vortex is expected to impact Ohio. Dipping Arctic air and frigid temperatures will hit the entire state, according to AccuWeather. Indiana and Kentucky will also be affected.\n\n\"There is a massive area of air in northwestern Canada where temperatures are 20 to 30 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, and it is on its way southeastward into the U.S.,\" AccuWeather Chief On-Air Meteorologist Bernie Rayno said. \"This is the mother lode of cold air and is a term I don't use lightly.\"Over the next few days, extreme cold air will barrel into the central and eastern U.S. \"like a wrecking ball,\" said Weather Trader meteorologist Ryan Maue in a post on X on Dec. 9, as reported by USA TODAY. Maue dubbed it a \"textbook 'Polar Vortex' mega-dump of western Canadian cold.\"\n\nThe cold blast could be relatively short-lived, however. Forecasts expect a return to more typical wintry temperatures as the polar vortex retreats back to the north.\n\nCurrently, no schools in the Columbus area have announced closures for Dec. 12. That could change before the morning, so continue monitoring the storms at dispatch.com.\n\nToday: A slight chance of snow showers before 11 a.m. Mostly cloudy, with a high near 32 degrees. There will be west wind 8 to 10 mph. There is a 20% chance of precipitation.\n\nTonight: A chance of snow, mainly after 2 a.m. Cloudy, with a low around 26 degrees. There will be west wind around 5 mph becoming calm in the evening. There is a 40% chance of precipitation. New snow accumulation of less than one inch possible.\n\nFriday, Dec. 12: A chance of snow, mainly after 7am. Mostly cloudy, with a high near 35. East wind 3 to 6 mph. Chance of precipitation is 50%.

    "fullText": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Rains drenched Gaza’s tent camps and dropping temperatures chilled Palestinians huddling inside them Thursday as winter storm Byron descended on the war-battered territory, showing how two months of a ceasefire have failed to sufficiently address the spiraling humanitarian crisis there.\n\nFamilies found their possessions and food supplies soaked inside their tents. Children’s sandaled feet disappeared under opaque brown water that flooded the camps, running knee deep in some places. Dirt roads turned to mud. Piles of garbage and sewage cascaded like waterfalls.\n\n“We have been drowned. I don’t have clothes to wear and we have no mattresses left,” said Um Salman Abu Qenas, a displaced mother in a Khan Younis tent camp. She said that her family couldn't sleep the night before, because of the water in the tent.\n\nAid groups say not enough shelter materials are getting into Gaza during the truce. Figures recently released by Israel's military suggest it hasn't met the ceasefire stipulation of allowing 600 trucks of aid into Gaza a day, though Israel disputes that finding.\n\n“Cold, overcrowded, and unsanitary environments heighten the risk of illness and infection,” the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said on X. “This suffering could be prevented by unhindered humanitarian aid, including medical support and proper shelter.\"\n\nSabreen Qudeeh, also in the Khan Younis camp, in a squalid area known as Muwasi, said that her family woke up to rain leaking from their tent's ceiling and water from the street soaking their mattresses.\n\n“My little daughters were screaming,” she said.\n\nAhmad Abu Taha, also living in the camp, said there wasn't a tent that escaped the flooding. “Conditions are very bad, we have old people, displaced, and sick people inside this camp,” he said.\n\nFloods in south-central Israel trapped more than a dozen people in their cars, according to Hebrew media. Israel's rescue services, MDA, said that two young girls were slightly injured when a tree fell on their school.\n\nThe contrasting scenes with Gaza made clear how profoundly the Israel-Hamas war had damaged the territory, destroying the majority of homes. Gaza’s population of around 2 million is almost entirely displaced, and most people live in vast tent camps stretching along the coast, or set up among the shells of damaged buildings without adequate flooding infrastructure and with cesspits dug near tents as toilets.\n\nAt least three buildings in Gaza City already damaged by Israeli bombardment during the war partially collapsed under the rain, Palestinian Civil Defense said. It warned people not to stay inside damaged buildings, saying they too could fall down on top of them.\n\nThe agency also said that since the storm began, they have received more than 2,500 distress calls from people across Gaza whose tents and shelters were damaged.\n\nWith buckets and mops, Palestinians laboriously scooped water out of their tents.\n\nAliaa Bahtiti said her 8-year-old son \"was soaked overnight, and in the morning he had turned blue, sleeping on water.” Her tent floor had an inch of water on it “We cannot buy food, covers, towels, or sheets to sleep on.”\n\nBaraka Bhar was caring for her 3-month-old twins inside her tent as the rain poured outside. One of the twins has hydrocephalus, a build-up of fluids in the brain.\n\n“Our tents are worn out ... and they leak rain water,” she said. “We should not lose our children this winter.”\n\nAid groups say that Israel isn't allowing enough aid into Gaza to begin rebuilding the territory after years of war.\n\nUnder the agreement, Israel agreed to comply with aid stipulations from an earlier January truce, which specified that it allow 600 trucks of aid each day into Gaza, It maintains it's doing so, but The Associated Press found that some of its own figures call that into question.\n\nThe January truce also specified that Israel let in a number of caravans and tents. No caravans have yet entered Gaza during the ceasefire, said Tania Hary, executive director of Gisha, an Israeli group advocating for Palestinians’ right to freedom of movement.\n\nThe Israeli military body in charge of coordinating aid to Gaza, called COGAT, said on Dec. 9 it had “lately\" let 260,000 tents and tarpaulins into Gaza and more than 1,500 trucks of blankets and warm clothing.\n\nShelter Cluster, an international coalition of aid providers led by the Norwegian Refugee Council, sets the number lower. It says the U.N. and international nongovernmental organizations have gotten 15,590 tents into Gaza since the truce began, and other countries have sent about 48,000. Many of the tents aren't properly insulated, it says.\n\nAmjad al-Shawa, Gaza chief of the Palestinian NGO Network, told Al Jazeera on Thursday that only a fraction of the 300,000 tents needed had entered Gaza. He said that Palestinians were in dire need of warmer winter clothes and accused Israel of blocking the entry of water pumps to help clear flooded shelters..\n\n\"All international sides should take the responsibility regarding conditions in Gaza,” he said. “There is real danger for people in Gaza at all levels.”\n\nKhaled Mashaal, a Hamas leader, said in an interview with Al Jazeera that Gaza needs the rehabilitation of hospitals, the entry of heavy machinery to remove rubble, and the opening of the Rafah crossing — which remains closed after Israel said last week it would shortly open.\n\nCOGAT didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the claims that Israel wasn’t allowing water pumps or heavy machinery into Gaza\n\nAmnesty accuses Hamas of crimes against humanity\n\nAmnesty International said in a report released Thursday that Hamas and other militant groups committed crimes against humanity in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel that triggered the war in Gaza.\n\nIn the 173-page report, Amnesty pointed to what it found to be widespread and systematic killing of civilians in the attack, as well as torture, hostage-taking and sexual abuse.\n\nIn the attack, Hamas fighters and other militants rampaged through southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking around 250 others hostage. Israel's campaign in Gaza has since killed more than 70,300 Palestinians, roughly half of them women and children, according to the territory’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and civilians in its count. Last year, Amnesty accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, a charge Israel denied.\n\nAmnesty said it conducted interviews with 70 people, including 17 survivors of the attack and family members of some of those killed. It also reviewed hundreds of open-source videos and photos from the day of the attack.\n\nContrary to Hamas claims it was targeting the military, it said, the attack was intentionally “directed against a civilian population” and met international law standards for crimes against humanity.\n\nIt said sexual assaults were also committed, though it said it could not reach a conclusion on their “scope or scale.” It interviewed one man who testified he was raped by armed men at the Nova music festival, as well as a therapist who said she provided intensive treatment to three other survivors of rape.\n\nHamas condemned the report, saying it “echoed false claims” by Israel.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister spokesperson Oren Marmorstein derided the report in a posting on X, saying it took more than two years for Amnesty to address the attack “and even now its report falls far short of reflecting the full scope of Hamas’s horrific atrocities.”",

    "fullText": "\"Ultimately, what matters is your own interpretation of the ending and of the story,\" Expedition 33 creative director Guillaume Broche told GameSpot.\n\n on December 10, 2025 at 10:53AM PST\n\nThe Game Awards are just around the corner, and while this time of year is surely exciting for all the nominees--and those of us eager for new game announcements--this year, there is one studio in particular that has more reason than any to celebrate: Sandfall Interactive.\n\nEarlier this year, the small-scale studio took the world by storm with its debut title, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Despite being Sandfall's first game, the narrative-driven, turn-based RPG quickly entered the pantheon of all-time greatest RPGs, earning nearly universal critical acclaim for its artistry, story, and espousal of mechanics and themes typically associated with Japanese RPGs.\n\nNow, Sandfall Interactive stands poised to make The Game Awards history. Last month, the studio broke The Game Awards' record for most award nominations, earning a whopping 13, including Game of the Year. Earlier this year, I spoke with the studio's creative director, Guillaume Broche, who said the team was in \"disbelief\" about how the game has been received; it stands to reason that this sentiment has only grown with the game's tremendous success.\n\nBroche also shared a bit of a behind-the-scenes look at the game's development, explaining how there were \"a lot of arguments\" about the game's ending, why the team opted for minimal user interface, and how many people are still unaware of the game's biggest inspiration.\n\nGameSpot: Firstly, I'd love to know: What is the atmosphere of the studio following the game's tremendous success?\n\nBroche: I think a lot of us are still in disbelief with how the game’s launched and how fans have embraced it. Every day we say to each other, \"Is this real?\" or, \"Can you believe that?\" when we see another milestone reached or that our favorite game developer or studio reached out and congratulated us. It's all really overwhelming in a way, and we’re super grateful for everyone for their faith and support.\n\nAs I played through Expedition 33, it felt to me like the team took a \"less is more\" approach to creating the game. There are few UI elements on the screen and oftentimes, the character's expressions and what they don't say are just as impactful as what they do. That said, I'd like to hear in your own words about your design philosophies and principles, if you could elaborate on them.\n\nWe always wanted to tell a story that felt realistic and grounded. Of course, we have fantasy elements in the story, but at its core it’s a fundamentally human story. And in that story we wanted to have subtle, realistic interactions and emotions--which is why there’s a certain \"less is more\" feeling, like you say. It just makes the game feel more \"real\" in our eyes, or at least easier to engage with and relate to. Not every interaction in real life is a perfectly written, theatrical conversation--sometimes it’s just a look, or subtle moments of quietness, that have the most impact.\n\nFor the UI, we also wanted to have that same grounded approach to exploration. We trust the player to find their way through our levels, to understand our systems, and to engage with the world in the way we intended. We took some inspirations from games we grew up with in that sense, avoiding bloating our game with systems and designs that ultimately don’t improve the main game experience.\n\nI've found that Clair Obscur is phenomenal in working within shades of grey and every character feels deeply human. As such, reflecting on the game's ethics and big decisions are both interesting and challenging. Do you believe there truly is a true or \"good\" ending to the game?\n\nThat’s something we've had a lot of arguments about in the team too! I think your reaction to the endings, and which one is the \"good\" ending, is super subjective and related to your own personal experiences in real life. And I think that’s a strength of our writing and story--kudos to our Lead Writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, and our amazing mocap and voice actors for their performances--sometimes there is no clear \"good\" or \"bad\" choice in life that everyone will be happy with, and living within the grey, and those complex choices, are what makes us real people. Ultimately, what matters is your own interpretation of the ending and of the story.\n\nMany sites have been quick to note Legend of Dragoon, the Final Fantasy series, and even From Software titles as games that Clair Obscur has seemingly drawn inspiration from, but are there any other works that inspired you that you want to talk about?\n\nActually, I didn’t play Legend of Dragoon before coming up with the QTEs (quick-time events) during skills. I learnt later that a game did something similar! There are also other inspirations like the Persona series, but also action games like Devil May Cry and Nier.\n\nOne major inspiration is a French novel called La Horde du Contrevent. It tells the story of a group of explorers--or an expedition--travelling across the world to find the source of the supernatural wind that sweeps across the world. Their tale, and the human stories of the team and their discoveries as they travel the world, were also an inspiration for us as we developed a story of our own expeditioners traveling across the world. I’d recommend that anyone who’s a fan of our story picks up this book, but I don’t think it’s been translated into English fully since it’s so densely written with so much nuance in the French language. So I guess maybe fans should learn French, and then read the novel!\n\nWhether Clair Obscur will break the record currently held by The Last of Us: Part II and take home more than seven awards from The Game Awards remains to be seen. However, with 13 nominations and a Game of the Year award on the line, it's certainly worth tuning in to see what happens. The Game Awards airs tomorrow, December 11, at 9:30 PM ET / 6:30 PM PT.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?
