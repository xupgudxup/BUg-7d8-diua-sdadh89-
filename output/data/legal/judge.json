    "fullText": "Two years after the Supreme Court effectively ended race-conscious college admissions nationwide, Johns Hopkins University has seen a significant change in the racial makeup of its freshman class, according to newly released enrollment data.\n\nSince 2023, the number of Asian first-year undergraduate students, as measured by federal reporting standards, has risen nearly 20 percentage points, to 45.1% from 25.6%. Black first-year student representation, meanwhile, has been cut in half, dropping to 4% from 9.8%, as has the Hispanic student population, which fell to 10.1% this year from 20.8% two years ago. White freshman enrollment remained relatively flat, at 21% in 2025, compared with 19.3% in 2023. Those self-reporting as white fell more sharply to 30.9% from 39.1%.\n\nThe data offer a clear, local snapshot of how elite universities may be changing in the wake of the 2023 ruling, which prohibited schools from considering race in admissions. While universities across the country warned the decision could reduce racial diversity, Johns Hopkins’ numbers show an especially stark shift.\n\n“Since the U.S. Supreme Court decision in [Students for Fair Admissions] v Harvard, we have been navigating an evolving legal and regulatory environment,” said university spokesman J.B. Bird in an email to the Baltimore Sun. “We continue to work on opening our doors as wide as possible to students from all backgrounds and perspectives.”\n\nThe research university has seen some success in its efforts to diversify by income level, regardless of race. The 2025 freshman class has the highest-ever number of Pell grant recipients, at 24.1%, up slightly from 23.8% last year and 21.6% the year before. First-generation college student admission remained flat from last year at 20.3% percent, but up from 19.4% in 2023. Both Pell grant recipients and first-generation college students had risen steadily since 2010.\n\nThe university’s new Tuition Promise program could also increase diversity in the coming years, said Amelia, a second-year graduate student who declined to give her last name.\n\nThe program, which begins next year, with January admissions, offers a free education to students whose families earn less than $200,000, and includes living expenses for those making less than $100,000.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision is already changing higher education in more ways than student body demographics can reveal, said Bryan Cook higher education policy director of the nonpartisan Urban Institute think tank. Johns Hopkins is not unique, though the court’s decision more strongly impacted private, elite college and universities that had been trying to recruit more diverse student bodies, Cook said. Schools like community colleges that accept all applications, and state schools that rely primarily on test scores for admissions, would not be affected, he said.\n\nA lot of institutions are having to make significant changes in their policies,” Cook said. “In many cases, this is already changing the demographics of what campuses look like.”\n\nIt’s difficult to determine the whole story, he said, admissions data only shows part of what is happening.\n\n“We know nothing about the demographics of their applicant pool and how that might line up with admissions,” Cook explained. “We don’t know what’s happening universally across all schools.”\n\nThe Urban Institute reached out to universities to request applicant data to improve their understanding, publishing their findings in July of 2025.\n\n“Early analysis from 18 institutions suggests that Black students’ share of the applicant pool increased more between 2023 and 2024 than in any of the prior five years,” the report states, “but their share of the admitted student pool held constant or even decreased. Furthermore, an increasing number of applicants have chosen not to disclose their race or ethnicity.”\n\nAmong elite universities, those admitting less than half of their applicants, Black student admissions fell to 5.9% in 2024 from 6.6% in 2023, while Black admissions at less selective schools remained level.\n\nMost Americans support fair admissions, said Edward Blum, the president of Students for Fair Admissions, the organization that brought the lawsuit against Harvard, resulting in the Supreme Court decision.\n\n“Credible polling from across the political spectrum indicates that Americans agree that a student’s race or ethnicity should not be considered as a factor in whether that student is accepted or rejected at any university,” Blum said.\n\nHopkins student Aaden, who asked to only be identified by his first name.\n\n“I believe it is important to have a diverse student body,” said Aaden, a third-year chemistry student, “although I think if we were picking people because of their race, it’s not fair to Asian and white students. People with lower grades might be picked because of their race.”\n\nAaden lives in Florida, where his parents immigrated from the Caribbean. He said he hasn’t experienced racism on campus but understands how new Black and Hispanic students might feel more isolated this year.\n\nMaria Laskaris, a college counselor from TopTier Admissions, helps students prepare for and get into schools best suited for their needs, beginning younger than high school age. She agreed that the Supreme Court ruling affects primarily highly selective private institutions, but said the changes would not necessarily change how she advises minority student clients.\n\n“I would make sure that any student I advise is aware of the landscape in which they are applying to college and various policies of the colleges they’re interested in,” she said. “It’s about how you set yourself apart. What do you bring to the table that makes you stand out from other applicants?”\n\nTricia Bishop contributed to this report.\n\nHave a news tip?

    "description": "Tesla engaged in false advertising for its Full Self-Driving system. Unless it fixes the issues, its license to sell in CA will be suspended.",
    "fullText": "A California judge ruled late Tuesday afternoon that Tesla engaged in “deceptive marketing” in reference to its Full Self-Driving system, and that Tesla’s license to sell and produce cars in the state should be revoked for 30 days.\n\nHowever, the California DMV has said it will give Tesla 60 days to comply and fix its marketing before going through with the suspension.\n\nThe ruling is big news in a case that has been ongoing for years now.\n\nTesla has been selling level 2 driver assist software since 2016 which it calls “Full Self-Driving” (FSD), despite that this software did not (and still does not) make its cars capable of driving themselves.\n\nThis name has attracted much consternation over the years, becoming more absurd as each of Tesla’s predicted deadlines for the advent of full autonomy blow by.\n\nTesla also provides software under the name “Autopilot,” another term that evokes some level of autonomy, though perhaps not as explicitly as the aforementioned FSD. Tesla long held the position that this word is meant to evoke airplane-like systems that still require a pilot, but can just do most of the work for them.\n\nSo eventually, in 2021, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) officially started an investigation into Tesla’s marketing claims, to determine whether the company had lied to consumers.\n\nCalifornia found that the company was saying different things to the public than it was saying to the DMV.\n\nThe DMV then sent an official inquiry to Tesla in 2022, asking for it to respond to the claim that it was creating incorrect perceptions about the capabilities of its system. Tesla’s response stated that it had been allowed to lie about FSD for so long that it should get to keep going, which was apparently not persuasive enough to the courts, and the case was then slated for trial.\n\nDuring this time, the California legislature got involved as well, passing a law that specifically banned automakers from deceiving consumers into thinking vehicles have more autonomous capabilities than they do.\n\nWell, after all these investigations and waiting, we finally have an an answer, and the judge’s ruling makes it quite clear: Tesla lied to consumers about its autonomous capabilities.\n\nThe court looked at Tesla’s marketing claims and also at surveys of people exposed to those claims and their opinion of whether a Tesla would be able to drive itself, given the marketing messages put out by the company.\n\nIt found problems both with the word Autopilot and the phrase Full Self-Driving.\n\nThe word “Autopilot” was not found to be “unambiguously false,” but the court said that its use “follows a long but unlawful tradition of ‘intentionally (using) ambiguity to mislead consumers while maintaining some level of deniability about the intended meaning.'” The court found that a reasonable person could believe that a car on Autopilot doesn’t require their constant undivided attention, which is incorrect as the driver is still fully responsible for the vehicle.\n\nOn “Full Self-Driving,” the court was even more harsh. It found that this feature name is “actually, unambiguously false and counterfactual” (comically, Tesla tried to argue here that “no reasonable person” could believe that Full Self-Driving actually means Full Self-Driving).\n\nThe court noted other language used by Tesla, including marketing copy that said “the system is designed to be able to conduct short and long distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver’s seat,” and suggested that “legal reasons” are the only things holding Tesla back from full autonomy. Tesla tried to say that this was a statement of future intent, but the court found that its use of the present tense shows otherwise.\n\nTesla has repeatedly changed its wording around FSD, first calling it Full Self-Driving Capability, then changing that to Full Self-Driving (Supervised) to emphasize the need for a driver to supervise the vehicle. The court noted these changes, and then said it would not be a burden to force Tesla to change its marketing further to clarify that its cars do not drive themselves.\n\nWhich leads us to the proposed legal remedy: the court said that the DMV could suspend or revoke Tesla’s licenses for 30 days, stopping its ability to sell or build cars in the state.\n\nTesla’s first factory is in Fremont, California, where it still builds around half a million vehicles a year and employs some ~20,000 employees. Tesla says this remedy would be “draconian,” but the court said that without this option, there’s no reason to believe Tesla would stop its misrepresentations to the public.\n\nThe court also examined the possibility of financial restitution, but deemed that inappropriate. Since the case did not establish any quantifiable financial harm done by Tesla’s misrepresentation and noted the impracticality of accounting for that harm.\n\nThis ruling does not yet mean that Tesla can’t sell cars in California, which is its largest market in the US by far. The court noted that the DMV has the option of suspension or revocation, which the DMV can do at its discretion. And the DMV has said that it will allow Tesla 60 days to comply with the order before it takes action, and that it would focus on Tesla’s dealer license rather than its manufacturing license.\n\nThis would mean, specifically, that Tesla not refer to a level 2 driving system as “Autopilot” or using language that suggests these vehicles are autonomous. It will have to change its marketing materials and stop making public statements misleading the public about its autonomous capabilities.\n\nTesla said after the ruling that “sales in California will continue uninterrupted.” But we’ll see what happens in 60 days, and what sort of changes Tesla does or does not make to its deceptive marketing.\n\nTuesday’s ruling is just one of many legal cases against Tesla right now, specifically having to do with FSD. One relevant case is a class action lawsuit in California claiming Tesla misled customers about its cars self-driving capabilities. This ruling could provide fuel for that lawsuit, given a California judge has already gone on the record with an official determination that Tesla misled the public about FSD.\n\nThe 30% federal solar tax credit is ending this year.

    "description": "The judge ruled Tesla should have to suspend manufacturing and sales in California for 30 days, but the DMV stayed those rulings for 90 days to allow Tesla to comply.",
    "fullText": "An administrative law judge has ruled that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing that gave customers a false impression of the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving driver assistance software, a pivotal development in a years-long case initiated by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nThe judge agreed with the state DMV’s request to suspend Tesla sales for 30 days as a penalty for its actions, but the DMV stayed the order and is giving Tesla 60 days to modify or remove any deceptive language before implementing the suspension, according to multiple outlets. The judge also recommended suspending Tesla’s manufacturing license for 30 days, but the DMV stayed that order, too, according to Bloomberg News.\n\n“The DMV’s decision today confirms that the department will hold every vehicle manufacturer to the highest safety standards to keep California’s drivers, passengers and pedestrians protected,” DMV director Steve Gordon said in a statement. “Tesla can take simple steps to pause this decision and permanently resolve this issue — steps autonomous vehicle companies and other automakers have been able to achieve in California’s nation-leading and supportive innovation marketplace.”\n\nTesla said in a post on X that: “Sales in California will continue uninterrupted.”\n\n“This was a ‘consumer protection’ order about the use of the term ‘Autopilot’ in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there’s a problem,” the company wrote.\n\nAfter the 60-day window, Tesla can appeal the decision and should Tesla comply, the suspensions will be dropped. But it’s not immediately clear what steps the DMV wants Tesla to take, beyond telling the company to “take action regarding its use of the term ‘autopilot.’” The DMV did not immediately respond to a request for clarification, or to a request regarding Tesla’s apparent plan to ignore the decision.\n\nTesla has faced multiple investigations from the California Attorney General, the Department of Justice, and the Securities and Exchange Commission over similar allegations that its marketing around partial autonomy systems was misleading. The company has also faced (and now settled) a number of personal civil lawsuits over crashes involving its Autopilot technology.\n\nThe case brought by the CA DMV has been winding through the state’s Office of Administrative Hearings for years. The agency essentially accused Tesla of making customers believe that its advanced driver assistance systems were capable of high levels of autonomy. This led to overconfidence in the systems, the DMV alleged, which has contributed to dozens of crashes and multiple deaths. Tesla refuted these claims by saying its marketing was protected speech.\n\nA shutdown of sales in California, even temporary, could have a major impact on Tesla’s business as it remains the company’s largest market in the United States. A manufacturing suspension could also hurt Tesla’s business. While the company has constructed a massive factory in Austin, Texas (and moved its official headquarters to the same location), it still relies on its Fremont, California factory to make hundreds of thousands of vehicles, including all North American-bound Model 3 sedans.\n\nThe judge’s decision comes at a moment when Tesla is advancing its Robotaxi service test in Austin. Over the weekend, the company removed the safety monitors from its small fleet in the city. It had been offering rides to customers in the city for the last six months, but with a safety monitor either in the driver’s or passenger’s seat. Those vehicles are running a different version of Tesla’s driving software than what the automaker’s customers have in their cars, CEO Elon Musk has said.\n\nThis story has been updated to include information from the DMV’s press release and Tesla’s response.",

    "description": "California's DMV ordered Tesla to change the name \"Autopilot\" within 90 days, or face a month-long dealership suspension.",
    "fullText": "Tesla may have to rebrand Autopilot.\n\nSteve Gordon, the Director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles, said in a media briefing on Tuesday that Tesla has 90 days to amend its advertising language or face a 30-day suspension from selling in California.\n\nGordon said on Tuesday that the DMV is specifically asking Tesla to change the name \"Autopilot\" to clarify that the company has advanced driving systems, which do not equate to an automated system or an autonomous vehicle. Changes must be made within 90 days, or the DMV will \"enforce the cessation of sales.\"\n\n\"My guess is that they will pursue some remedy,\" said Gordon of what Tesla might do next, \"but the easiest one for them is just to come into compliance.\"\n\nIn response to the DMV's decision, a Tesla spokesperson told Business Insider that this is \"a 'consumer protection' order about the use of the term 'Autopilot' in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there's a problem.\"\n\n\"Sales in California will continue uninterrupted,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nOn November 21, Administrative Judge Juliet E. Cox made a proposed decision about whether Tesla has misled consumers into thinking its cars are more capable of driving themselves than they actually are, and transmitted it to the DMV for consideration. The document containing the proposal, however, has been withheld from the public and won't be released till December 22.\n\nGordon said during the Tuesday briefing that Cox recommended both a suspension of Tesla's license to sell and to manufacture in California. The DMV, however, decided not to pursue a suspension of the license to manufacture and put a temporary 90-day stay on the suspension of the license to sell for Tesla to make amends.\n\n\"They're very important to the state,\" said Gordon of Tesla. \"We want to be fair to them and give them a chance to see if they can find a resolution now that there is a ruling from the administrative law judge.\"\n\n\"If you look at the Q3 report of this year, Tesla has the top-selling car, the Model Y, in its segment,\" Gordon added. \"We felt that the leverage via the sales channel was sufficient to get compliance.\"\n\nThe notice to Tesla follows a weeklong hearing in July at the administrative court in Oakland. In 2022, the DMV sued Tesla, accusing the carmaker of misleading consumers through Tesla's advertisements and by naming its driver assistance technologies \"Full Self-Driving\" and \"Autopilot.\"\n\nTesla, which had a rocky year, denied that the company had ever tried to conceal the fact that its vehicles cannot fully drive themselves.\n\nThe DMV sought to suspend Tesla's ability to sell cars in the state for at least 30 days and award consumers monetary damages.\n\nThe CA DMV wrote in its complaint that on multiple occasions in 2021 and 2022, Tesla's website advertised its FSD driver assistance system as being \"designed to be able to conduct short and long-distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver's seat.\"\n\nTesla's lawyers said during the hearing that the company has always informed buyers that they \"cannot fully rely\" on FSD or Autopilot.\n\n\"Cars with Full Self-Driving capabilities are currently not capable of driving themselves,\" said Attorney Matthew Benedetto, a member of Tesla's legal team, during the hearing.",

    "fullText": "A High Court judge has thrown out a legal claim from a man who claimed to represent a Saudi prince in an alleged sale of Reform UK treasurer Nick Candy’s penthouse.\n\nMichael Brown brought “hopeless” legal action against Mr Candy and a group of eight others, including One Hyde Park, the Knightsbridge complex that contains Mr Candy’s penthouse, Judge Neil Cadwallader said.\n\nMr Brown, who represented himself at a Tuesday hearing but left halfway through citing medical reasons, appeared to be seeking £659 million over an alleged fraudulent valuation of the penthouse and an alleged breach of contract, the judge said.\n\n“The nature of the claim is extremely difficult to discern from the brief details given in the claim form and the witness evidence of the claimant, while expanding these details somewhat does not make the matter any clearer,” the judge said.\n\nHe added: “Not only were these claims hopeless, they were misconceived and baseless and bound to fail.”\n\nDavid Lascelles, for Mr Candy, said in written submissions that Mr Brown had contacted Mr Candy’s representatives in 2016, saying that a Saudi prince was interested in buying the penthouse at One Hyde Park.\n\nIn July of that year, Mr Candy provided a letter from the estate agency Savills which showed an estimated value of £160 million and that a full valuation could be given if negotiations progressed.\n\nMr Lascelles said that two days later, however, Mr Brown sent an email saying he had received racist abuse at the hotel next to One Hyde Park, the Mandarin Oriental.\n\nHe said that he could not recommend the sale of the penthouse, meaning the sale was off.\n\nIn 2018, Mr Brown brought legal action at the High Court against Mr Candy, his company Candy Capital, and One Hyde Park, attempting to claim £1.5 billion, but this was thrown out by a judge.\n\nMr Lascelles said: “The claimant now seeks to resurrect the claims already found to be totally without merit.”\n\nHe continued: “It is a reasonable inference that the claimant is seeking to deploy these proceedings to exert pressure and to generate publicity by scurrilous allegations, rather than to pursue any properly arguable legal claim.\n\n“He has wasted significant public resources, including the time of numerous judges, masters and employees of HM Courts and Tribunals Service, against whom he has also made serious and wholly unfounded allegations of wrongdoing.”\n\nMr Brown was made bankrupt following the previous litigation after he failed to pay legal costs.\n\nAt the hearing on Tuesday, he said he was made bankrupt as a result of fraud.\n\nHe said: “Any reasonable person would say that is a kangaroo court. This is the basic principle, I am entitled to have a fair trial and a completely fair fight.\n\n“How can it be a fair fight if I am outnumbered?”\n\nHe also asked the court to allow his case to continue because he was “hoping to get the backing of Elon Musk”.\n\nIf that happens, the case “will be all over”, he added.\n\nMr Brown also claimed that lawyers for Mr Candy had “cheated” by confirming a witness statement as true when they knew it to be false.\n\nHe said that this amounted to contempt of court, but it was refused by Judge Cadwallader, who described Mr Brown’s claims as “incoherent”.\n\nThe judge said: “Mr Brown attempted to suggest that the lawyers acting for the defendants were clever people and used to the exercise of working out what the claim means, but that is no answer.\n\n“They are entitled not to have to guess.”\n\nHe continued: “Accordingly, I will make an order dismissing the claimant’s claim on all these grounds against all the defendants.”\n\nJudge Cadwallader also ordered a civil restraining order to prevent Mr Brown from bringing further legal action about the same issue and ordered him to pay costs.",

    "fullText": "Paris Saint-Germain have been ordered by a Paris labour court to pay Kylian Mbappe €60 million in unpaid salary and bonuses, bringing an end to a prolonged legal dispute between the club and their former forward.\n\nThe ruling, delivered earlier today, follows months of proceedings after Mbappe claimed PSG withheld wages and contractual bonuses in the final months of his deal before his free transfer to Real Madrid in the summer of 2024.\n\nThe France captain argued that payments for April, May and June of that year were never made, despite being stipulated in his contract.\n\nJudges ruled in Mbappe’s favour, concluding that PSG failed to pay three months of salary as well as an ethics bonus and a signing bonus.\n\nThe court noted that these outstanding sums had already been recognised by the French Professional Football League in decisions taken in September and October last year, strengthening the player’s case.\n\nPSG attempted to argue that Mbappe had agreed to forgo the payments as part of an informal arrangement linked to his reintegration into the squad during the 2023-24 season.\n\nHowever, the court stated that the club was unable to provide any written agreement proving that the player had waived his contractual rights, leading to that defence being dismissed.\n\nMbappe’s lawyer, Frederique Cassereau, welcomed the ruling and described it as a predictable outcome under French labour law. She said the decision simply reflected the fact that salaries and bonuses written into a contract must be paid in full.\n\nWhile Mbappe succeeded in securing the €60m award, the court rejected several additional claims made on his behalf.\n\nAllegations of moral harassment, concealed work and breaches of the employer’s duty of care were all dismissed, and the court declined to reclassify his fixed-term contract as a permanent one, which limited the scope for further compensation.\n\nPSG had also accused Mbappe of acting disloyally by concealing his intention not to renew his contract, arguing that this deprived the club of the chance to secure a significant transfer fee.\n\nThe judges ruled that such considerations were not relevant to the core issue of unpaid remuneration and therefore had no bearing on the outcome.\n\nMbappe spent seven years at PSG after initially joining from Monaco in 2017, winning six Ligue 1 titles and 15 major trophies. He left as the club’s all-time leading scorer with 256 goals in 308 appearances.\n\nThe verdict closes a contentious chapter in the relationship between PSG and their former talisman and confirms the club’s obligation to settle the outstanding payments in full.",

    "fullText": "SYDNEY (AP) — A judge sentenced a Sydney taekwondo instructor on Tuesday to life in prison without possibility of release for murdering a 7-year-old student and the boy’s parents.\n\nKwang Kyung Yoo, 51, sat with his head bowed as Justice Ian Harrison said he would never be eligible for parole.\n\nHarrison said Yoo has been motivated by the jealousy he felt for the family’s financial success.\n\n“I’m satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of these offenses is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of a life sentence,” Harrison told the New South Wales Supreme Court.\n\nHarrison said Yoo had no reason to murder the boy or his parents in February last year.\n\nState law prevents child victims of crime from being identified, so the boy’s parents also can’t be named.\n\nYoo and his victims were all born in South Korea.\n\nYoo had pleaded guilty to the three murders at an earlier court appearance. He had no prior criminal record.\n\nYoo had strangled the boy and his 41-year-old mom in his Lion’s Taekwondo and Martial Arts Academy in western Sydney. He owed tens of thousands of dollars at the time and was behind in rent on the academy.\n\nHe took the mother’s Apple watch and drove her luxury BMW car to the family home where he stabbed the boy’s 39-year-old father to death.\n\nYoo was injured in the struggle in the home and drove himself to hospital where he told medical staff he had been attacked in a supermarket car park. Police arrested him at the hospital.\n\nAfter his arrest, Yoo could not explain how he intended to get the family’s money and later detailed his remorse.\n\nThe former instructor, whose students called him Master Lion, did not look at the victims’ family and other supporters as they sobbed in the court’s public gallery after the sentence was handed down.\n\n“These killings were horrific and violent acts, senselessly cruel and cynical, perpetrated without a trace of human compassion,” the judge said.\n\nWhile the crimes were planned — with Yoo surveilling the family’s home beforehand — he made no attempt to conceal his crimes from the CCTV cameras in his academy or try to conceal the bodies.\n\nAt a sentence hearing in November, the judge heard Yoo had lied about meeting the wealthiest Australian, Gina Rinehart, qualifying for the Sydney Olympics in 2000, owning a Lamborghini luxury car and living in Sydney’s wealthy eastern suburbs.\n\nTo impress his own wife, he would send emails to himself, pretending to be important people. He sometimes used the title professor.\n\nHarrison noted that Yoo had told a psychologist his lies became bigger and bigger as his wife and students asked more questions.\n\nThe judge noted Yoo had been burdened since childhood with unrealistic expectations from his parents and South Korean culture about the level of success he needed to achieve.\n\nYoo was handed a box of tissues as the judge described his deep remorse for the hurt and pain that he had caused.\n\nIn a letter to the judge, Yoo said he was “held captive by sin” and that he wanted to give himself to Jesus Christ.\n\n“I wish I could turn back time so this didn’t happen,” Yoo wrote. “I pray every day for the people I have hurt.”\n\nYoo’s lawyers had argued that he should be given a minimum nonparole period rather than a life sentence without possibility of release. The maximum penalty for someone convicted of murder in New South Wales is life imprisonment, with a standard nonparole period of 20 years for the murder of an adult and 25 years for the murder of a child.",

(AP) — A judge on Monday disbarred Hunter Biden in Connecticut for violating the state's attorney conduct rules, a decision that comes after complaints were made about the federal gun and tax charges Biden was convicted of before being pardoned last year by his father, former President Joe Biden.\n\nIn an agreement with the state office that disciplines lawyers, Hunter Biden consented to being disbarred and admitted to attorney misconduct, but he did not admit to any criminal wrongdoing. He was disbarred in Washington, D.C., in May.\n\nHunter Biden did not speak as he and his lawyer, Ross Garber, appeared via video at a virtual court hearing before Judge Trial Referee Patrick L.

He agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor and felony charges hours after jury selection was set to begin.\n\nThe Connecticut judge found that Hunter Biden violated several ethical rules for lawyers, including engaging in conduct “involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\" In a court document, Hunter Biden admitted to some but not all of the misconduct allegations. The judge also cited the Washington disbarment.\n\nPaul Dorsey, one of the two people who filed the complaints about the former president's son, told the judge during Monday's hearing that he objected to the agreement because Hunter Biden did not admit to committing crimes. But Leanne Larson, an attorney with the Office of Chief Disciplinary Counsel, cited the pardon.\n\nHunter Biden was admitted to the Connecticut bar in 1997, a year after graduating from Yale Law School.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration said in a court filing Monday that the president’s White House ballroom construction project must continue for unexplained national security reasons and because a preservationists' organization that wants it stopped has no standing to sue.\n\nThe filing was in response to a lawsuit filed last Friday by the National Trust for Historic Preservation asking a federal judge to halt President Donald Trump's project until it goes through multiple independent reviews and a public comment period and wins approval from Congress.\n\nThe administration's 36-page filing included a declaration from Matthew C. Quinn, deputy director of the U.S. Secret Service, the agency responsible for the security of the president and other high-ranking officials, that said more work on the site of the former White House East Wing is still needed to meet the agency’s “safety and security requirements.” The filing did not explain the specific national security concerns; the administration has offered to share classified details with the judge in a private, in-person setting without the plaintiffs present.\n\nThe East Wing had sat atop a emergency operations bunker for the president.\n\nQuinn said even a temporary halt to construction would “consequently hamper” the agency's ability to fulfill its statutory obligations and its protective mission.\n\nA hearing in the case was scheduled for Tuesday in federal court in Washington.\n\nThe government’s response offered the most comprehensive look yet at the ballroom construction project, including a window into how it was so swiftly approved by the Trump administration bureaucracy and its expanding scope.\n\nThe filings assert that final plans for the ballroom have yet to be finalized despite the continuing demolition and other work to prepare the site for eventual construction. Below-ground work on the site continues, wrote John Stanwich, the National Park Service’s liaison to the White House, and work on the foundations is set to begin in January. Above-ground construction “is not anticipated to begin until April 2026, at the earliest,” he wrote.\n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation did not respond to email messages seeking comment.\n\nThe privately funded group last week asked the U.S. District Court to block Trump's project.\n\n“No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever — not President Trump, not President Biden, and not anyone else,” the lawsuit states. “And no president is legally allowed to construct a ballroom on public property without giving the public the opportunity to weigh in.”\n\nTrump had the East Wing torn down in October as part of his plan to build an estimated $300 million, 90,000-square-foot (27,432-square-meter) ballroom able to accommodate about 1,000 people before his term ends in January 2029. He says presidents before him long have wanted an event space larger than the rooms currently at the White House, and says the ballroom would end the practice of entertaining visiting foreign dignitaries in large, temporary pavilions on the south grounds.\n\nThe Trust asserts that the plans should have been submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission, the Commission of Fine Arts and Congress before any action was taken. The lawsuit notes that the Trust wrote to those entities and the National Park Service on Oct. 21, after East Wing demolition began, urging a stop to the project and asking the administration to comply with federal law, but received no response.\n\nThe lawsuit cites several federal statutes and rules detailing the role the planning and fine arts commission and lawmakers play in U.S. government construction projects.\n\nThe administration argued in its response that the president has the authority to modify the White House and included the extensive history of changes and additions to the Executive Mansion since it was built more than 200 years ago. It also asserted that the president is not subject to the statutes cited by the plaintiffs.\n\nDepartment of Justice attorneys said in the filing that the plaintiff's claims about the East Wing demolition are “moot” because the tear-down cannot be undone. The administration also argues that claims about future construction are “unripe” because the plans are not final.\n\nThe administration also contends that the Trust cannot establish “irreparable harm” because above-ground construction is not expected until spring. It argues that the reviews sought in the lawsuit, consultation with the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, “will soon be underway without this Court's involvement.”\n\nTrump's ballroom project has prompted criticism in the historic preservation and architectural communities, and among his political adversaries, but the lawsuit is the most tangible effort thus far to alter or stop his plans for an addition that itself would be nearly twice the size of the White House before the East Wing was torn down.\n\nIn 2000, the National Park Service's Comprehensive Design Plan for the White House first identified the need for a larger event space to address an increase in visitors and to provide a venue suitable for major events, according to the administration's filing.",

    "description": "The Jeffrey Epstein victims'  lawsuits resembled two others, against JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, which settled for hundreds of millions.",
    "fullText": "A federal judge expressed skepticism about a pair of lawsuits that victims of Jeffrey Epstein had filed against two banks, suggesting he may dismiss them before they have a chance to go to trial.\n\nAt the outset of a Monday afternoon hearing in Manhattan federal court, US District Judge Jed Rakoff unfavorably compared the lawsuits against Bank of America and BNY Mellon to two similar lawsuits he had previously overseen, against JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank. JPMorgan agreed to settle the case for $290 million. Deutsche Bank agreed to settle for $75 million.\n\nRakoff said the language in the lawsuits against Bank of America and BNY Mellon — which were brought by the same attorneys and filed in October — was \"frequently conclusory\" and appeared to lack sufficient detail to demonstrate what the banks did wrong. He called the lawsuits \"a model of high-pitched rhetoric.\"\n\n\"'Knows' without saying by whom is vague. 'Affiliated' without saying what that means is vague,\" Rakoff told David Boies, an attorney who brought the case. \"A lot of that language is in the complaint.\"\n\nAt the end of the hearing, Rakoff gave the lawyers who brought the lawsuits on behalf of Epstein victims — David Boies, Sigrid McCawley, Brad Edwards, and Brittany Henderson — two weeks to revise their cases with more specific details about their allegations.\n\nThe judge said they would be permitted to use material they had already gathered as part of the discovery process in the case, but should put a hold on additional depositions and subpoenas until he issued a ruling, which he said could come at the end of January.\n\nThe lawsuits allege that Bank of America and BNY Mellon aided in Epstein's sex-trafficking operation by providing him with banking services and then ignoring red flags tied to his transactions.\n\nEpstein, a well-connected financier, killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on criminal sex-trafficking charges. One of his associates, Ghislaine Maxwell, is serving a 20-year prison sentence for trafficking girls to him.\n\nMonday's hearing was scheduled for the judge to weigh motions to dismiss the two lawsuits outright.\n\nCharlotte Taylor, an attorney at the law firm Jones Day representing Bank of America, argued the lawsuits consisted of \"recycled boilerplate allegations\" and that they could not prove the bank provided anything other than \"routine banking services\" to Epstein and his associates. Felicia Ellsworth, an attorney at WilmerHale, said the plaintiffs couldn't prove anyone at BNY Mellon had the \"state of mind\" to be found liable.\n\nBoies told Rakoff that the banks should have noticed enough smoke around the transactions from bank accounts belonging to Epstein and his associates to know there was a fire. Aside from Epstein's 2008 criminal conviction in Florida, he had been dogged by civil litigation for years, Boies said.\n\nRakoff expressed skepticism that the pattern of facts alleged in the lawsuit would be enough.\n\n\"Last I checked, that's not enough to survive a motion to dismiss,\" Rakoff said. \"You need to have enough allegations as to specific facts.\"\n\nFollowing the hearing, lawyers for the Epstein victims appeared eager to revise their lawsuits and include the information they obtained through the discovery process. Rakoff said that material may be redacted on the public docket.\n\n\"I think he's giving us a chance,\" Sigrid McCawley, an attorney at Boies Schiller Flexner, told Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "The decision means TikTok now operates under the threat that it could be forced offline with a stroke of Trump’s pen\n\nJudicial opinions allowing the government to suppress speech in the name of national security rarely stand the test of time. But time has been unusually unkind to the US supreme court decision that upheld the law banning TikTok, the short-form video platform. The court issued its ruling less than a year ago, but it is already obvious that the deference the court gave to the government’s national security arguments was spectacularly misplaced. The principal effect of the court’s ruling has been to give our own government enormous power over the policies of a speech platform used by tens of millions of Americans every day – a result that is an affront to the first amendment and a national security risk in its own right.\n\nCongress passed the TikTok ban in 2023 citing concerns that the Chinese government might be able to access information about TikTok’s American users or covertly manipulate content on the platform in ways that threatened US interests. The ban was designed to prevent Americans from using TikTok starting in January 2025 unless TikTok’s China-based corporate owner, ByteDance Inc, sold its US subsidiary before then.\n\nMany first amendment advocates and scholars – including the two of us – expected the court to be intensely suspicious of the law. After all, TikTok is one of the most popular speech platforms in the country, and banning foreign media is a practice usually associated with the world’s most repressive regimes. Even more damningly, a long list of legislators forthrightly acknowledged that their support for the ban stemmed not only from general concerns about what users might see on the app but from a desire to suppress specific kinds of content – especially videos showing the devastation caused by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza and other content deemed to be sympathetic to Palestinians. For laws that affect speech, motivations like that are usually fatal.\n\nBut the justices upheld the ban – unanimously – in a thin and credulous opinion issued just a week after oral argument. Apparently untroubled by legislators’ censorial motivations, the court said the law could be justified by privacy concerns, and it accepted without serious scrutiny the government’s argument that the ban was necessary to protect users’ data.\n\nPrivacy and security experts had told the court that banning TikTok would not in fact meaningfully constrain China’s ability to collect Americans’ data, and that if the government wanted to address legitimate privacy concerns online it could do so without so dramatically curtailing Americans’ free speech rights. But the court said that it was not the court’s job to second-guess the executive branch’s decisions about national security and foreign affairs.\n\nThis is not how the first amendment is supposed to work. For one thing, courts are not supposed to close their eyes when the government says it wants to control what people can say or hear. A law motivated by a desire to suppress particular categories of content – to suppress “misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda”, as the House committee report on the bill put it – should at the very least be subject to stringent review.\n\nAnd courts are not supposed to allow the government to side-step that review simply by declaring that national security requires censorship. That is the central lesson of the last hundred years of first amendment doctrine.\n\nDuring the first Red Scare, courts allowed the government to use the Espionage Act to imprison hundreds of activists for nothing more than opposing the war. The cases from that time are regarded as stains on first amendment history, and modern first amendment doctrine evolved as a reaction against these mistakes. Courts are supposed to have learned that it is their job to protect the democratic process by being skeptical of purported national security justifications for suppressing speech.\n\nEvents since the Supreme Court upheld the TikTok ban have only underscored why the justices were wrong to defer to the government’s arguments. The court issued its ruling on 17 January because the ban was meant to go into effect two days later. But even after the court rushed to judgment, Donald Trump issued an order saying he would suspend enforcement of the law for 75 days.\n\nSince then, he has extended this suspension four more times without any legal basis—and he may extend it again. Meanwhile, TikTok remains freely available. Legislators who were insistent that TikTok poses an urgent threat to American security cannot be reached for comment. All of this makes a mockery of the government’s earlier claims that TikTok was an urgent national security risk – and of the court that deferred to those claims.\n\nEven worse, the court’s decision means that TikTok now operates under the threat that it could be forced offline with a stroke of the president’s pen. Conservatives and liberals alike have expressed concerns for years about government officials using threats to “jawbone” social media companies into changing their content-moderation policies, but no previous administration has enjoyed the power to extinguish a platform simply by enforcing existing law.\n\nWhether TikTok is already conforming its policies to Trump’s preferences – as many American universities, media companies and law firms have been doing – is difficult to know. Even if the platform is not conforming now, though, it may well in the future, because Trump has been brokering a deal to have the platform transferred to his ideological allies.\n\nPlainly, the court cannot be blamed for all of this. It could not have predicted that President Trump would simply refuse to enforce the law. Still, we could have avoided this ending if the court had not bungled the beginning. If the court had carefully scrutinized the government’s national security arguments, it would have seen that the TikTok ban, for all of its novelty, is actually just a familiar example of the government exploiting national security fears to intimidate courts into giving it power that the constitution puts off limits.\n\nThe court would have understood that the ban itself created a serious national security risk – the kind of risk the modern first amendment was intended to prevent – by giving the government far-reaching influence over public discourse online.\n\nOver the coming months, the supreme court will confront other cases in which the government invokes national security to justify the suppression of speech. The court’s analysis of those cases should be haunted by the TikTok case and its embarrassing, scandalous coda. We need the court to play its constitutionally appointed role – and not simply defer credulously to political actors deploying the rhetoric of national security in the service of censorship.\n\nEvelyn Douek is an assistant professor at Stanford Law School\n\nJameel Jaffer is inaugural director of the Knight first amendment institute at Columbia University",

    "fullText": "However, Apple can collect ‘appropriate’ fees from external App Store links, says court.\n\nHowever, Apple can collect ‘appropriate’ fees from external App Store links, says court.\n\nApple has lost its appeal of a massive district court ruling in its ongoing antitrust dispute with Epic Games.\n\nThat April ruling from Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said that Apple “willingly” failed to comply with a 2021 order allowing mobile app developers to link to payment options outside of Apple’s, and she barred Apple from charging a commission on in-app purchases using external payment links, among other restrictions. In today’s opinion, the three-judge Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel largely affirmed Gonzalez Rogers’ contempt findings and the limits on Apple. But it asked the judge to consider options that would let Apple charge reasonable fees for external link purchases.\n\nGonzalez Rogers’ ruling took issue with a series of moves Apple made to discourage developers from using external payment methods, including adding a 27 percent fee for external payments, requiring developers to restrict links to plain text instead of allowing them to make buttons, and showing users a fullscreen warning when they tapped an external link. The appeals court agreed that “Apple claimed to comply with the injunction, but it instead prohibited developers from using buttons, links, and other calls to action without paying a prohibitive commission to Apple, and it restricted the design of the developers’ links to make it difficult for customers to use them.”\n\nBut the appeals court ruling said Gonzalez Rogers had gone too far in one area: prohibiting Apple from collecting any fee on in-app purchases from developers. “Rather than coercing Apple to comply with the spirit of the Injunction with a reasonable, non-prohibitive commission, the district court used blunt force to ban all commissions, abusing its discretion,” according to the opinion.\n\nThe panel has recommendations about an “appropriate commission or fee limitation,” including that Apple charge based on the necessary costs for “its coordination of external links for linked-out purchases.”\n\nThe opinion also says that while Apple can’t force developers to make their own options less visible or appealing than Apple’s default, it can restrict developers from placing buttons, links, or “other calls to action” in “more prominent fonts, larger sizes, larger quantities, and more prominent places than Apple uses for its own buttons, links, or other calls to action.”\n\nApple and Epic didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney retweeted posts from Bloomberg and Schaeffer’s Investment Research about the ruling.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department violated the constitutional rights of a close friend of James Comey and must return to him computer files that prosecutors had hoped to use for a potential criminal case against the former FBI director, a federal judge said Friday.\n\nThe ruling from U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly represents not only a stern rebuke of the conduct of Justice Department prosecutors but also imposes a dramatic hurdle to government efforts to seek a new indictment against Comey after an initial one was dismissed last month.\n\nThe order concerns computer files and communications that investigators obtained years earlier from Daniel Richman, a Comey friend and Columbia University law professor, as part of a media leak investigation that concluded without charges. The Justice Department continued to hold onto those files and conducted searches of them this fall, without a new warrant, as they prepared a case charging Comey with lying to Congress five years ago.\n\nRichman alleged that the Justice Department violated his Fourth Amendment rights by retaining his records and by conducting new warrantless searches of the files, prompting Kollar-Kotelly to issue an order last week temporarily barring prosecutors from accessing the files as part of its investigation.\n\nThe Justice Department said the request for the return of the records was merely an attempt to impede a new prosecution of Comey, but the judge again sided with Richman in a 46-page order Friday that directed the Justice Department to give him back his files.\n\n“When the Government violates the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures by sweeping up a broad swath of a person’s electronic files, retaining those files long after the relevant investigation has ended, and later sifting through those files without a warrant to obtain evidence against someone else, what remedy is available to the victim of the Government’s unlawful intrusion?” the judge wrote.\n\nOne answer, she said, is to require the government to return the property to the rightful owner.\n\nThe judge did, however, permit the Justice Department to file an electronic copy of Richman's records under seal with the Eastern District of Virginia, where the Comey investigation has been based, and suggested prosecutors could try to access it later with a lawful search warrant.\n\nThe Justice Department alleges that Comey used Richman to share information with the news media about his decision-making during the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. Prosecutors charged the former FBI director in September with lying to Congress by denying that he had authorized an associate to serve as an anonymous source for the media.\n\nThat indictment was dismissed last month after a federal judge in Virginia ruled that the prosecutor who brought the case, Lindsey Halligan, was unlawfully appointed by the Trump administration. But the ruling left open the possibility that the government could try again to seek charges against Comey, a longtime foe of President Donald Trump. Comey has pleaded not guilty, denied having made a false statement and accused the Justice Department of a vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Comey saga has a long history.\n\nIn June 2017, one month after Comey was fired as FBI director, he testified that he had given Richman a copy of a memo he had written documenting a conversation he had with Trump and had authorized him to share the contents of the memo with a reporter.\n\nAfter that testimony, Richman permitted the FBI to create an image, or complete electronic copy, of all files on his computer and a hard drive attached to that computer. He authorized the FBI to conduct a search for limited purposes, the judge noted.\n\nThen, in 2019 and 2020, the FBI and Justice Department obtained search warrants to obtain Richman's email accounts and computer files as part of a media leak investigation that concluded in 2021 without charges. Those warrants were limited in scope, but Richman has alleged that the government collected more information than the warrants allowed, including personal medial information and sensitive correspondence.\n\nIn addition, Richman said the Justice Department violated his rights by searching his files in September, without a new warrant, as part of an entirely separate investigation.\n\n“The Court further concludes that the Government’s retention of Petitioner Richman’s files amounts to an ongoing unreasonable seizure,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote. “Therefore, the Court agrees with Petitioner Richman that the Government has violated his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures.”",

    "fullText": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia must be freed from immigration detention while he fights his deportation, a judge ruled Thursday, handing a major victory to the immigrant whose wrongful deportation to a notorious prison in El Salvador made him a flashpoint of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement to let Abrego Garcia go immediately, writing that federal authorities had detained him again after his return to the United States without any legal basis.\n\n“For this reason, the Court will GRANT Abrego Garcia’s Petition for immediate release from ICE custody,” the judge wrote.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security sharply criticized the decision and vowed to appeal, calling the ruling “naked judicial activism” by a judge appointed during the Obama administration.\n\n“This order lacks any valid legal basis, and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary. The judge gave prosecutors until 5 p.m. EST to formally respond to the release order.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment, and messages seeking comment from Abrego Garcia’s attorney were not immediately returned.\n\nAbrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national with an American wife and child, has lived in Maryland for years but entered the U.S. illegally as a teenager. An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that he could not be deported to El Salvador because he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family. When he was mistakenly sent there in March, his case became a rallying point for those who oppose President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement actions.\n\nA court later ordered his return to the United States. Since he cannot be removed to El Salvador, ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries. His federal suit claims the Trump administration is illegally using the removal process to punish Abrego Garcia for the public embarrassment caused by his deportation.\n\nIn her order releasing Abrego Garcia, Xinis wrote that federal authorities “did not just stonewall” the court, “They affirmatively misled the tribunal.” The judge was referencing the successive list of four African countries that officials had sought to remove Abrego Garcia seemingly without commitments from those countries, as well as officials' affirmations that Costa Rica withdrew its offer to accept him, a claim later proven untrue.\n\n“But Costa Rica had never wavered in its commitment to receive Abrego Garcia, just as Abrego Garcia never wavered in his commitment to resettle there,” the judge wrote.\n\nXinis also rejected the government’s argument that she lacked jurisdiction to intervene on a final removal order for Abrego Garcia, because she found no final order had been filed.\n\nSeparately, Abrego Garcia is asking an immigration court to reopen his case so he can seek asylum in the United States.\n\nHe is also criminally charged in Tennessee, where he has pleaded not guilty to human smuggling. He has asked the federal court to dismiss the case, arguing the prosecution is vindictive. His defense attorney in Tennessee, Sean Hecker, declined to comment.\n\nA judge in that case has ordered an evidentiary hearing after previously finding some evidence that the charges “may be vindictive.” The judge also noted several statements by Trump administration officials that “raise cause for concern,” including a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that seemed to suggest the Justice Department charged Abrego Garcia because he won his wrongful deportation case. ___\n\nLoller reported from Nashville, Seewer reported from Toledo, Ohio and Lauer reported from Philadelphia.

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge has allowed a Tufts University student from Turkey to resume research and teaching while she deals with the consequences of having her visa revoked by the Trump administration, leading to six weeks of detention.\n\nThe arrest of Rümeysa Öztürk, a PhD student studying children's relationship to social media, was among the first as the Trump administration began targeting foreign-born students and activists involved in pro-Palestinian advocacy. She had co-authored an op-ed criticizing her university’s response to Israel and the war in Gaza. Caught on video in March outside her Somerville residence, immigration enforcement officers took her away in an unmarked vehicle.\n\nÖztürk has been out of a Louisiana immigrant detention center since May and back on the Tufts campus. But she's been unable to teach or participate in research as part of her studies because of the termination of her record in the government's database of foreign students studying temporarily in the U.S.\n\nIn her ruling Monday, Chief U.S. District Judge Denise J. Casper wrote that Öztürk is likely to succeed on claims that the termination was “arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law and in violation of the First Amendment.”\n\nGovernment argued that termination was legal\n\nThe government’s lawyers unsuccessfully argued that the Boston federal court lacked jurisdiction and that Öztürk’s Student and Exchange Visitor Information System record (SEVIS) record was terminated legally after her visa was revoked, making her eligible for removal proceedings.\n\n“There’s no statute or regulation that’s been violated by the termination of the SEVIS record in this case,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Sauter said during a hearing last week. The Associated Press sent an email Tuesday seeking comment from Sauter on whether the government plans to appeal.\n\nIn a statement, Öztürk, who plans to graduate next year, said while she is grateful for the court's decision, she feels “a great deal of grief” for the education she has been “arbitrarily denied as a scholar and a woman in my final year of doctoral studies.”\n\n“I hope one day we can create a world where everyone uses education to learn, connect, civically engage and benefit others — rather than criminalize and punish those whose opinions differ from our own,” said Öztürk, who is still challenging her arrest and detention.\n\nThe then-30-year-old was one of four students who wrote the opinion piece in the campus newspaper. It criticized the university’s response to student activists demanding that Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel.\n\nÖztürk, who is Muslim, was meeting friends in March for iftar, a meal that breaks a fast at sunset during Ramadan, according to her lawyer, Mahsa Khanbabai. Her student visa had been revoked several days earlier, but she was not informed of that, her lawyers said. The government asserted that terminating her SEVIS record two hours after her arrest was a proper way of informing Tufts University about her visa revocation.\n\nA State Department memo said Öztürk's visa was revoked following an assessment that her actions “‘may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization’ including co-authoring an op-ed that found common cause with an organization that was later temporarily banned from campus.”\n\nÖztürk running out of time to pursue teaching, research goals\n\nWithout her SEVIS status reinstated, Öztürk said she couldn't qualify as a paid research assistant and couldn't fully reintegrate into academic life at Tufts.\n\n“We have a strange kind of legal gaslighting here, where the government claims it’s just a tinkering in a database, but this is really something that has a daily impact on Ms. Öztürk’s life,” her attorney, Adriana Lafaille of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, said in court.\n\n“We are running out of time to make this right. Each day that goes by is a day that she is being prevented from doing the work that she loves in the graduate program that she came here to be part of. Each day that this happens is a day that the government is allowed to continue to punish her for her protected speech.”\n\nÖztürk, meanwhile, has maintained a full course load and fulfilled all requirements to maintain her lawful student status, which the government hasn't terminated, her lawyer said.\n\nRecord created to collect information on international students\n\nSEVIS is mandated by Congress in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 and administered by the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement “to collect information relating to nonimmigrant foreign students” and “use such information to carry out the enforcement functions of” ICE.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, when a SEVIS record is terminated, a student loses all on and/ or off-campus employment authorization and allows ICE agents to investigate to “confirm the departure of the student.”\n\nMcCormack reported from Concord, New Hampshire.",

    "fullText": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin judge on Tuesday refused to step aside as requested by President Donald Trump's former attorney who faces felony forgery case related to the 2020 election in the battleground state.\n\nThe judge also refused to cancel a Monday preliminary hearing for Trump's former attorney, who also previously worked as a judge in the same county where he is being prosecuted, and two other former Trump associates.\n\nThe three former Trump aides face 11 felony charges each in relation to their roles in the 2020 fake elector scheme. They are: Jim Troupis, who was Trump’s attorney in Wisconsin in the 2020 election; Kenneth Chesebro, an attorney who advised Trump's campaign; and Mike Roman, Trump’s director of Election Day operations in 2020.\n\nTroupis, joined by the other two defendants, argued in a motion filed Monday that all of the judges in Dane County were biased against him. Troupis was a judge in the county for one year from 2015 to 2016.\n\nHe also alleged that the judge hearing his case, Dane County Circuit Judge John Hyland, had solicited help from a retired judge in writing an August order refusing to dismiss the case against him.\n\nTroupis argued in the motion that the retired judge who “carries personal animus” toward Troupis from their time together on the bench actually wrote the order. Troupis asked for an evidentiary hearing in another county.\n\nHe included an expert analysis of the writing style that compares the order to the writing style of retired Dane County Judge Frank Remington. Troupis' attorney also attached a Nov. 25 letter he wrote to Hyland claiming that other attorneys told him that Remington actually wrote the August order because the writing style matched Remington’s in a civil case they litigated before him.\n\nHyland rejected those arguments and Troupis' call for moving the case to another county.\n\n“The Court is satisfied that no person other the assigned staff attorney and I had a hand in drafting or editing the decision which this Court signed and entered,” Hyland wrote.\n\nHyland also wrote that he had “no personal animus or prejudice toward any of the litigants” and was satisfied that he could fairly hear the case. He declined to step aside as requested.\n\nHyland also said that Troupis presented no evidence to support his claim that every other judge in the country was prejudiced against him and therefore can’t fairly hear the case.\n\nTroupis’ attorney, Joe Bugni, did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nTroupis, Chesebro and Roman each face 11 felony charges for allegedly using forgery in an attempt to defraud each of the 10 Republican electors who cast their ballots for Trump in 2020 as part of a plan to submit paperwork falsely claiming that the Republican had won the battleground state that year.\n\nTrump lost Wisconsin in 2020 but fought to have the defeat overturned. He won the state in both 2016 and 2024.\n\nThe Wisconsin Department of Justice, which is prosecuting the case, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe state charges against the Trump attorneys and aide are the only ones in Wisconsin. None of the electors have been charged. The 10 Wisconsin electors, Chesebro and Troupis all settled a lawsuit that was brought against them in 2023.\n\nFederal prosecutors who investigated Trump’s conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, said the fake electors scheme originated in Wisconsin.\n\nThe Wisconsin complaint details how Troupis, Chesebro and Roman created a document that falsely said Trump had won Wisconsin’s 10 Electoral College votes and then attempted to deliver the document to then-Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nThe Trump associates have argued that no crime took place. But the judge in August rejected their arguments in allowing the case to proceed.\n\nA judge threw out a similar case in Michigan in September. And last year, a special prosecutor dropped a federal case alleging Trump conspired to overturn the 2020 election. A Georgia election interference case was dropped by prosecutors earlier last month, and another similar case remains in Nevada.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge investigating whether Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem should face a contempt charge over flights carrying migrants to El Salvador said Monday he wants to hear from a whistleblower and top Justice Department official.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington ordered the government to make Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign available for testimony on Dec. 16. Boasberg wants to hear a day earlier from fired Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni.\n\nThe order for testimony ratchets up the extraordinary clash between the judicial and executive branches.\n\nIn March, Boasberg ordered the Republican administration to turn around two planes carrying Venezuelan migrants.\n\nInstead, the planes landed in El Salvador hours later, touching off the contempt probe. Boasberg is trying to determine whether the administration willfully ignored his order and should be referred for prosecution on a contempt charge.\n\nReuveni has filed a whistleblower complaint alleging a Justice Department official suggested the Trump administration might have to ignore court orders as it prepared to deport Venezuelan migrants it accused of being gang members. The administration has said the allegations are untrue.\n\nThe Justice Department has said Ensign conveyed Boasberg’s oral order and a subsequent written order to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIn a written declaration submitted to the court Friday, Noem said she made the decision not to return the planes to the U.S. after receiving “privileged legal advice” from the Homeland Security Department’s acting general counsel and “through him from the senior leadership of the Department of Justice.”\n\nBoasberg, who was nominated to the federal bench by President Barack Obama, a Democrat, called Noem’s declaration “cursory.”\n\n“As this declaration does not provide enough information for the Court to determine whether her decision was a willful violation of the Court’s Order, the Court cannot at this juncture find probable cause that her actions constituted criminal contempt,” the judge wrote in Monday's order.\n\nThe administration has said it did not violate Boasberg’s order. The judge’s directive to return the planes was made verbally in court but not included in his written order, government attorneys said in a court filing in November.\n\nThat order blocked the administration from removing “any of the individual Plaintiffs from the United States for 14 days,” but said nothing about the flights already airborne, they said.\n\nThe two planes had already departed U.S. territory and airspace, so the migrants aboard them had already been “removed” and therefore fell outside of the court’s order, Justice Department lawyers said in the court filing.\n\nJustice Department attorneys in a court filing Friday objected to any “live testimony,” urging Boasberg instead to “proceed promptly” with a criminal contempt referral if he believed his order was “sufficiently clear in imposing an obligation to halt the transfer of custody for detainees who had already been removed from the United States.”",
