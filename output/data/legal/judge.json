    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration said in a court filing Monday that the president’s White House ballroom construction project must continue for unexplained national security reasons and because a preservationists' organization that wants it stopped has no standing to sue.\n\nThe filing was in response to a lawsuit filed last Friday by the National Trust for Historic Preservation asking a federal judge to halt President Donald Trump's project until it goes through multiple independent reviews and a public comment period and wins approval from Congress.\n\nThe administration's 36-page filing included a declaration from Matthew C. Quinn, deputy director of the U.S. Secret Service, the agency responsible for the security of the president and other high-ranking officials, that said more work on the site of the former White House East Wing is still needed to meet the agency’s “safety and security requirements.” The filing did not explain the specific national security concerns; the administration has offered to share classified details with the judge in a private, in-person setting without the plaintiffs present.\n\nThe East Wing had sat atop a emergency operations bunker for the president.\n\nQuinn said even a temporary halt to construction would “consequently hamper” the agency's ability to fulfill its statutory obligations and its protective mission.\n\nA hearing in the case was scheduled for Tuesday in federal court in Washington.\n\nThe government’s response offered the most comprehensive look yet at the ballroom construction project, including a window into how it was so swiftly approved by the Trump administration bureaucracy and its expanding scope.\n\nThe filings assert that final plans for the ballroom have yet to be finalized despite the continuing demolition and other work to prepare the site for eventual construction. Below-ground work on the site continues, wrote John Stanwich, the National Park Service’s liaison to the White House, and work on the foundations is set to begin in January. Above-ground construction “is not anticipated to begin until April 2026, at the earliest,” he wrote.\n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation did not respond to email messages seeking comment.\n\nThe privately funded group last week asked the U.S. District Court to block Trump's project.\n\n“No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever — not President Trump, not President Biden, and not anyone else,” the lawsuit states. “And no president is legally allowed to construct a ballroom on public property without giving the public the opportunity to weigh in.”\n\nTrump had the East Wing torn down in October as part of his plan to build an estimated $300 million, 90,000-square-foot (27,432-square-meter) ballroom able to accommodate about 1,000 people before his term ends in January 2029. He says presidents before him long have wanted an event space larger than the rooms currently at the White House, and says the ballroom would end the practice of entertaining visiting foreign dignitaries in large, temporary pavilions on the south grounds.\n\nThe Trust asserts that the plans should have been submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission, the Commission of Fine Arts and Congress before any action was taken. The lawsuit notes that the Trust wrote to those entities and the National Park Service on Oct. 21, after East Wing demolition began, urging a stop to the project and asking the administration to comply with federal law, but received no response.\n\nThe lawsuit cites several federal statutes and rules detailing the role the planning and fine arts commission and lawmakers play in U.S. government construction projects.\n\nThe administration argued in its response that the president has the authority to modify the White House and included the extensive history of changes and additions to the Executive Mansion since it was built more than 200 years ago. It also asserted that the president is not subject to the statutes cited by the plaintiffs.\n\nDepartment of Justice attorneys said in the filing that the plaintiff's claims about the East Wing demolition are “moot” because the tear-down cannot be undone. The administration also argues that claims about future construction are “unripe” because the plans are not final.\n\nThe administration also contends that the Trust cannot establish “irreparable harm” because above-ground construction is not expected until spring. It argues that the reviews sought in the lawsuit, consultation with the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, “will soon be underway without this Court's involvement.”\n\nTrump's ballroom project has prompted criticism in the historic preservation and architectural communities, and among his political adversaries, but the lawsuit is the most tangible effort thus far to alter or stop his plans for an addition that itself would be nearly twice the size of the White House before the East Wing was torn down.\n\nIn 2000, the National Park Service's Comprehensive Design Plan for the White House first identified the need for a larger event space to address an increase in visitors and to provide a venue suitable for major events, according to the administration's filing.",

    "description": "The Jeffrey Epstein victims'  lawsuits resembled two others, against JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, which settled for hundreds of millions.",
    "fullText": "A federal judge expressed skepticism about a pair of lawsuits that victims of Jeffrey Epstein had filed against two banks, suggesting he may dismiss them before they have a chance to go to trial.\n\nAt the outset of a Monday afternoon hearing in Manhattan federal court, US District Judge Jed Rakoff unfavorably compared the lawsuits against Bank of America and BNY Mellon to two similar lawsuits he had previously overseen, against JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank. JPMorgan agreed to settle the case for $290 million. Deutsche Bank agreed to settle for $75 million.\n\nRakoff said the language in the lawsuits against Bank of America and BNY Mellon — which were brought by the same attorneys and filed in October — was \"frequently conclusory\" and appeared to lack sufficient detail to demonstrate what the banks did wrong. He called the lawsuits \"a model of high-pitched rhetoric.\"\n\n\"'Knows' without saying by whom is vague. 'Affiliated' without saying what that means is vague,\" Rakoff told David Boies, an attorney who brought the case. \"A lot of that language is in the complaint.\"\n\nAt the end of the hearing, Rakoff gave the lawyers who brought the lawsuits on behalf of Epstein victims — David Boies, Sigrid McCawley, Brad Edwards, and Brittany Henderson — two weeks to revise their cases with more specific details about their allegations.\n\nThe judge said they would be permitted to use material they had already gathered as part of the discovery process in the case, but should put a hold on additional depositions and subpoenas until he issued a ruling, which he said could come at the end of January.\n\nThe lawsuits allege that Bank of America and BNY Mellon aided in Epstein's sex-trafficking operation by providing him with banking services and then ignoring red flags tied to his transactions.\n\nEpstein, a well-connected financier, killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on criminal sex-trafficking charges. One of his associates, Ghislaine Maxwell, is serving a 20-year prison sentence for trafficking girls to him.\n\nMonday's hearing was scheduled for the judge to weigh motions to dismiss the two lawsuits outright.\n\nCharlotte Taylor, an attorney at the law firm Jones Day representing Bank of America, argued the lawsuits consisted of \"recycled boilerplate allegations\" and that they could not prove the bank provided anything other than \"routine banking services\" to Epstein and his associates. Felicia Ellsworth, an attorney at WilmerHale, said the plaintiffs couldn't prove anyone at BNY Mellon had the \"state of mind\" to be found liable.\n\nBoies told Rakoff that the banks should have noticed enough smoke around the transactions from bank accounts belonging to Epstein and his associates to know there was a fire. Aside from Epstein's 2008 criminal conviction in Florida, he had been dogged by civil litigation for years, Boies said.\n\nRakoff expressed skepticism that the pattern of facts alleged in the lawsuit would be enough.\n\n\"Last I checked, that's not enough to survive a motion to dismiss,\" Rakoff said. \"You need to have enough allegations as to specific facts.\"\n\nFollowing the hearing, lawyers for the Epstein victims appeared eager to revise their lawsuits and include the information they obtained through the discovery process. Rakoff said that material may be redacted on the public docket.\n\n\"I think he's giving us a chance,\" Sigrid McCawley, an attorney at Boies Schiller Flexner, told Business Insider.",

The court issued its ruling less than a year ago, but it is already obvious that the deference the court gave to the government’s national security arguments was spectacularly misplaced. The principal effect of the court’s ruling has been to give our own government enormous power over the policies of a speech platform used by tens of millions of Americans every day – a result that is an affront to the first amendment and a national security risk in its own right.\n\nCongress passed the TikTok ban in 2023 citing concerns that the Chinese government might be able to access information about TikTok’s American users or covertly manipulate content on the platform in ways that threatened US interests. The ban was designed to prevent Americans from using TikTok starting in January 2025 unless TikTok’s China-based corporate owner, ByteDance Inc, sold its US subsidiary before then.\n\nMany first amendment advocates and scholars – including the two of us – expected the court to be intensely suspicious of the law. After all, TikTok is one of the most popular speech platforms in the country, and banning foreign media is a practice usually associated with the world’s most repressive regimes. Even more damningly, a long list of legislators forthrightly acknowledged that their support for the ban stemmed not only from general concerns about what users might see on the app but from a desire to suppress specific kinds of content – especially videos showing the devastation caused by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza and other content deemed to be sympathetic to Palestinians. For laws that affect speech, motivations like that are usually fatal.\n\nBut the justices upheld the ban – unanimously – in a thin and credulous opinion issued just a week after oral argument. Apparently untroubled by legislators’ censorial motivations, the court said the law could be justified by privacy concerns, and it accepted without serious scrutiny the government’s argument that the ban was necessary to protect users’ data.\n\nPrivacy and security experts had told the court that banning TikTok would not in fact meaningfully constrain China’s ability to collect Americans’ data, and that if the government wanted to address legitimate privacy concerns online it could do so without so dramatically curtailing Americans’ free speech rights. But the court said that it was not the court’s job to second-guess the executive branch’s decisions about national security and foreign affairs.\n\nThis is not how the first amendment is supposed to work. For one thing, courts are not supposed to close their eyes when the government says it wants to control what people can say or hear. A law motivated by a desire to suppress particular categories of content – to suppress “misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda”, as the House committee report on the bill put it – should at the very least be subject to stringent review.\n\nAnd courts are not supposed to allow the government to side-step that review simply by declaring that national security requires censorship. That is the central lesson of the last hundred years of first amendment doctrine.\n\nDuring the first Red Scare, courts allowed the government to use the Espionage Act to imprison hundreds of activists for nothing more than opposing the war. The cases from that time are regarded as stains on first amendment history, and modern first amendment doctrine evolved as a reaction against these mistakes. Courts are supposed to have learned that it is their job to protect the democratic process by being skeptical of purported national security justifications for suppressing speech.\n\nEvents since the Supreme Court upheld the TikTok ban have only underscored why the justices were wrong to defer to the government’s arguments. The court issued its ruling on 17 January because the ban was meant to go into effect two days later. But even after the court rushed to judgment, Donald Trump issued an order saying he would suspend enforcement of the law for 75 days.\n\nSince then, he has extended this suspension four more times without any legal basis—and he may extend it again. Meanwhile, TikTok remains freely available. Legislators who were insistent that TikTok poses an urgent threat to American security cannot be reached for comment. All of this makes a mockery of the government’s earlier claims that TikTok was an urgent national security risk – and of the court that deferred to those claims.\n\nEven worse, the court’s decision means that TikTok now operates under the threat that it could be forced offline with a stroke of the president’s pen. Conservatives and liberals alike have expressed concerns for years about government officials using threats to “jawbone” social media companies into changing their content-moderation policies, but no previous administration has enjoyed the power to extinguish a platform simply by enforcing existing law.\n\nWhether TikTok is already conforming its policies to Trump’s preferences – as many American universities, media companies and law firms have been doing – is difficult to know. Even if the platform is not conforming now, though, it may well in the future, because Trump has been brokering a deal to have the platform transferred to his ideological allies.\n\nPlainly, the court cannot be blamed for all of this. It could not have predicted that President Trump would simply refuse to enforce the law. Still, we could have avoided this ending if the court had not bungled the beginning. If the court had carefully scrutinized the government’s national security arguments, it would have seen that the TikTok ban, for all of its novelty, is actually just a familiar example of the government exploiting national security fears to intimidate courts into giving it power that the constitution puts off limits.\n\nThe court would have understood that the ban itself created a serious national security risk – the kind of risk the modern first amendment was intended to prevent – by giving the government far-reaching influence over public discourse online.\n\nOver the coming months, the supreme court will confront other cases in which the government invokes national security to justify the suppression of speech. The court’s analysis of those cases should be haunted by the TikTok case and its embarrassing, scandalous coda. We need the court to play its constitutionally appointed role – and not simply defer credulously to political actors deploying the rhetoric of national security in the service of censorship.\n\nEvelyn Douek is an assistant professor at Stanford Law School\n\nJameel Jaffer is inaugural director of the Knight first amendment institute at Columbia University",

In today’s opinion, the three-judge Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel largely affirmed Gonzalez Rogers’ contempt findings and the limits on Apple. But it asked the judge to consider options that would let Apple charge reasonable fees for external link purchases.\n\nGonzalez Rogers’ ruling took issue with a series of moves Apple made to discourage developers from using external payment methods, including adding a 27 percent fee for external payments, requiring developers to restrict links to plain text instead of allowing them to make buttons, and showing users a fullscreen warning when they tapped an external link. The appeals court agreed that “Apple claimed to comply with the injunction, but it instead prohibited developers from using buttons, links, and other calls to action without paying a prohibitive commission to Apple, and it restricted the design of the developers’ links to make it difficult for customers to use them.”\n\nBut the appeals court ruling said Gonzalez Rogers had gone too far in one area: prohibiting Apple from collecting any fee on in-app purchases from developers. “Rather than coercing Apple to comply with the spirit of the Injunction with a reasonable, non-prohibitive commission, the district court used blunt force to ban all commissions, abusing its discretion,” according to the opinion.\n\nThe panel has recommendations about an “appropriate commission or fee limitation,” including that Apple charge based on the necessary costs for “its coordination of external links for linked-out purchases.”\n\nThe opinion also says that while Apple can’t force developers to make their own options less visible or appealing than Apple’s default, it can restrict developers from placing buttons, links, or “other calls to action” in “more prominent fonts, larger sizes, larger quantities, and more prominent places than Apple uses for its own buttons, links, or other calls to action.”\n\nApple and Epic didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department violated the constitutional rights of a close friend of James Comey and must return to him computer files that prosecutors had hoped to use for a potential criminal case against the former FBI director, a federal judge said Friday.\n\nThe ruling from U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly represents not only a stern rebuke of the conduct of Justice Department prosecutors but also imposes a dramatic hurdle to government efforts to seek a new indictment against Comey after an initial one was dismissed last month.\n\nThe order concerns computer files and communications that investigators obtained years earlier from Daniel Richman, a Comey friend and Columbia University law professor, as part of a media leak investigation that concluded without charges. The Justice Department continued to hold onto those files and conducted searches of them this fall, without a new warrant, as they prepared a case charging Comey with lying to Congress five years ago.\n\nRichman alleged that the Justice Department violated his Fourth Amendment rights by retaining his records and by conducting new warrantless searches of the files, prompting Kollar-Kotelly to issue an order last week temporarily barring prosecutors from accessing the files as part of its investigation.\n\nThe Justice Department said the request for the return of the records was merely an attempt to impede a new prosecution of Comey, but the judge again sided with Richman in a 46-page order Friday that directed the Justice Department to give him back his files.\n\n“When the Government violates the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures by sweeping up a broad swath of a person’s electronic files, retaining those files long after the relevant investigation has ended, and later sifting through those files without a warrant to obtain evidence against someone else, what remedy is available to the victim of the Government’s unlawful intrusion?” the judge wrote.\n\nOne answer, she said, is to require the government to return the property to the rightful owner.\n\nThe judge did, however, permit the Justice Department to file an electronic copy of Richman's records under seal with the Eastern District of Virginia, where the Comey investigation has been based, and suggested prosecutors could try to access it later with a lawful search warrant.\n\nThe Justice Department alleges that Comey used Richman to share information with the news media about his decision-making during the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. Prosecutors charged the former FBI director in September with lying to Congress by denying that he had authorized an associate to serve as an anonymous source for the media.\n\nThat indictment was dismissed last month after a federal judge in Virginia ruled that the prosecutor who brought the case, Lindsey Halligan, was unlawfully appointed by the Trump administration. But the ruling left open the possibility that the government could try again to seek charges against Comey, a longtime foe of President Donald Trump. Comey has pleaded not guilty, denied having made a false statement and accused the Justice Department of a vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Comey saga has a long history.\n\nIn June 2017, one month after Comey was fired as FBI director, he testified that he had given Richman a copy of a memo he had written documenting a conversation he had with Trump and had authorized him to share the contents of the memo with a reporter.\n\nAfter that testimony, Richman permitted the FBI to create an image, or complete electronic copy, of all files on his computer and a hard drive attached to that computer. He authorized the FBI to conduct a search for limited purposes, the judge noted.\n\nThen, in 2019 and 2020, the FBI and Justice Department obtained search warrants to obtain Richman's email accounts and computer files as part of a media leak investigation that concluded in 2021 without charges. Those warrants were limited in scope, but Richman has alleged that the government collected more information than the warrants allowed, including personal medial information and sensitive correspondence.\n\nIn addition, Richman said the Justice Department violated his rights by searching his files in September, without a new warrant, as part of an entirely separate investigation.\n\n“The Court further concludes that the Government’s retention of Petitioner Richman’s files amounts to an ongoing unreasonable seizure,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote. “Therefore, the Court agrees with Petitioner Richman that the Government has violated his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures.”",

    "fullText": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia must be freed from immigration detention while he fights his deportation, a judge ruled Thursday, handing a major victory to the immigrant whose wrongful deportation to a notorious prison in El Salvador made him a flashpoint of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement to let Abrego Garcia go immediately, writing that federal authorities had detained him again after his return to the United States without any legal basis.\n\n“For this reason, the Court will GRANT Abrego Garcia’s Petition for immediate release from ICE custody,” the judge wrote.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security sharply criticized the decision and vowed to appeal, calling the ruling “naked judicial activism” by a judge appointed during the Obama administration.\n\n“This order lacks any valid legal basis, and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary. The judge gave prosecutors until 5 p.m. EST to formally respond to the release order.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment, and messages seeking comment from Abrego Garcia’s attorney were not immediately returned.\n\nAbrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national with an American wife and child, has lived in Maryland for years but entered the U.S. illegally as a teenager. An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that he could not be deported to El Salvador because he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family. When he was mistakenly sent there in March, his case became a rallying point for those who oppose President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement actions.\n\nA court later ordered his return to the United States. Since he cannot be removed to El Salvador, ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries. His federal suit claims the Trump administration is illegally using the removal process to punish Abrego Garcia for the public embarrassment caused by his deportation.\n\nIn her order releasing Abrego Garcia, Xinis wrote that federal authorities “did not just stonewall” the court, “They affirmatively misled the tribunal.” The judge was referencing the successive list of four African countries that officials had sought to remove Abrego Garcia seemingly without commitments from those countries, as well as officials' affirmations that Costa Rica withdrew its offer to accept him, a claim later proven untrue.\n\n“But Costa Rica had never wavered in its commitment to receive Abrego Garcia, just as Abrego Garcia never wavered in his commitment to resettle there,” the judge wrote.\n\nXinis also rejected the government’s argument that she lacked jurisdiction to intervene on a final removal order for Abrego Garcia, because she found no final order had been filed.\n\nSeparately, Abrego Garcia is asking an immigration court to reopen his case so he can seek asylum in the United States.\n\nHe is also criminally charged in Tennessee, where he has pleaded not guilty to human smuggling. He has asked the federal court to dismiss the case, arguing the prosecution is vindictive. His defense attorney in Tennessee, Sean Hecker, declined to comment.\n\nA judge in that case has ordered an evidentiary hearing after previously finding some evidence that the charges “may be vindictive.” The judge also noted several statements by Trump administration officials that “raise cause for concern,” including a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that seemed to suggest the Justice Department charged Abrego Garcia because he won his wrongful deportation case. ___\n\nLoller reported from Nashville, Seewer reported from Toledo, Ohio and Lauer reported from Philadelphia.

The arrest of Rümeysa Öztürk, a PhD student studying children's relationship to social media, was among the first as the Trump administration began targeting foreign-born students and activists involved in pro-Palestinian advocacy.

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge has allowed a Tufts University student from Turkey to resume research and teaching while she deals with the consequences of having her visa revoked by the Trump administration, leading to six weeks of detention.\n\nThe arrest of Rümeysa Öztürk, a PhD student studying children's relationship to social media, was among the first as the Trump administration began targeting foreign-born students and activists involved in pro-Palestinian advocacy. She had co-authored an op-ed criticizing her university’s response to Israel and the war in Gaza. Caught on video in March outside her Somerville residence, immigration enforcement officers took her away in an unmarked vehicle.\n\nÖztürk has been out of a Louisiana immigrant detention center since May and back on the Tufts campus. But she's been unable to teach or participate in research as part of her studies because of the termination of her record in the government's database of foreign students studying temporarily in the U.S.\n\nIn her ruling Monday, Chief U.S. District Judge Denise J. Casper wrote that Öztürk is likely to succeed on claims that the termination was “arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law and in violation of the First Amendment.”\n\nGovernment argued that termination was legal\n\nThe government’s lawyers unsuccessfully argued that the Boston federal court lacked jurisdiction and that Öztürk’s Student and Exchange Visitor Information System record (SEVIS) record was terminated legally after her visa was revoked, making her eligible for removal proceedings.\n\n“There’s no statute or regulation that’s been violated by the termination of the SEVIS record in this case,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Sauter said during a hearing last week. The Associated Press sent an email Tuesday seeking comment from Sauter on whether the government plans to appeal.\n\nIn a statement, Öztürk, who plans to graduate next year, said while she is grateful for the court's decision, she feels “a great deal of grief” for the education she has been “arbitrarily denied as a scholar and a woman in my final year of doctoral studies.”\n\n“I hope one day we can create a world where everyone uses education to learn, connect, civically engage and benefit others — rather than criminalize and punish those whose opinions differ from our own,” said Öztürk, who is still challenging her arrest and detention.\n\nThe then-30-year-old was one of four students who wrote the opinion piece in the campus newspaper. It criticized the university’s response to student activists demanding that Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel.\n\nÖztürk, who is Muslim, was meeting friends in March for iftar, a meal that breaks a fast at sunset during Ramadan, according to her lawyer, Mahsa Khanbabai. Her student visa had been revoked several days earlier, but she was not informed of that, her lawyers said. The government asserted that terminating her SEVIS record two hours after her arrest was a proper way of informing Tufts University about her visa revocation.\n\nA State Department memo said Öztürk's visa was revoked following an assessment that her actions “‘may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization’ including co-authoring an op-ed that found common cause with an organization that was later temporarily banned from campus.”\n\nÖztürk running out of time to pursue teaching, research goals\n\nWithout her SEVIS status reinstated, Öztürk said she couldn't qualify as a paid research assistant and couldn't fully reintegrate into academic life at Tufts.\n\n“We have a strange kind of legal gaslighting here, where the government claims it’s just a tinkering in a database, but this is really something that has a daily impact on Ms. Öztürk’s life,” her attorney, Adriana Lafaille of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, said in court.\n\n“We are running out of time to make this right. Each day that goes by is a day that she is being prevented from doing the work that she loves in the graduate program that she came here to be part of. Each day that this happens is a day that the government is allowed to continue to punish her for her protected speech.”\n\nÖztürk, meanwhile, has maintained a full course load and fulfilled all requirements to maintain her lawful student status, which the government hasn't terminated, her lawyer said.\n\nRecord created to collect information on international students\n\nSEVIS is mandated by Congress in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 and administered by the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement “to collect information relating to nonimmigrant foreign students” and “use such information to carry out the enforcement functions of” ICE.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, when a SEVIS record is terminated, a student loses all on and/ or off-campus employment authorization and allows ICE agents to investigate to “confirm the departure of the student.”\n\nMcCormack reported from Concord, New Hampshire.",

    "fullText": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin judge on Tuesday refused to step aside as requested by President Donald Trump's former attorney who faces felony forgery case related to the 2020 election in the battleground state.\n\nThe judge also refused to cancel a Monday preliminary hearing for Trump's former attorney, who also previously worked as a judge in the same county where he is being prosecuted, and two other former Trump associates.\n\nThe three former Trump aides face 11 felony charges each in relation to their roles in the 2020 fake elector scheme. They are: Jim Troupis, who was Trump’s attorney in Wisconsin in the 2020 election; Kenneth Chesebro, an attorney who advised Trump's campaign; and Mike Roman, Trump’s director of Election Day operations in 2020.\n\nTroupis, joined by the other two defendants, argued in a motion filed Monday that all of the judges in Dane County were biased against him. Troupis was a judge in the county for one year from 2015 to 2016.\n\nHe also alleged that the judge hearing his case, Dane County Circuit Judge John Hyland, had solicited help from a retired judge in writing an August order refusing to dismiss the case against him.\n\nTroupis argued in the motion that the retired judge who “carries personal animus” toward Troupis from their time together on the bench actually wrote the order. Troupis asked for an evidentiary hearing in another county.\n\nHe included an expert analysis of the writing style that compares the order to the writing style of retired Dane County Judge Frank Remington. Troupis' attorney also attached a Nov. 25 letter he wrote to Hyland claiming that other attorneys told him that Remington actually wrote the August order because the writing style matched Remington’s in a civil case they litigated before him.\n\nHyland rejected those arguments and Troupis' call for moving the case to another county.\n\n“The Court is satisfied that no person other the assigned staff attorney and I had a hand in drafting or editing the decision which this Court signed and entered,” Hyland wrote.\n\nHyland also wrote that he had “no personal animus or prejudice toward any of the litigants” and was satisfied that he could fairly hear the case. He declined to step aside as requested.\n\nHyland also said that Troupis presented no evidence to support his claim that every other judge in the country was prejudiced against him and therefore can’t fairly hear the case.\n\nTroupis’ attorney, Joe Bugni, did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nTroupis, Chesebro and Roman each face 11 felony charges for allegedly using forgery in an attempt to defraud each of the 10 Republican electors who cast their ballots for Trump in 2020 as part of a plan to submit paperwork falsely claiming that the Republican had won the battleground state that year.\n\nTrump lost Wisconsin in 2020 but fought to have the defeat overturned. He won the state in both 2016 and 2024.\n\nThe Wisconsin Department of Justice, which is prosecuting the case, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe state charges against the Trump attorneys and aide are the only ones in Wisconsin. None of the electors have been charged. The 10 Wisconsin electors, Chesebro and Troupis all settled a lawsuit that was brought against them in 2023.\n\nFederal prosecutors who investigated Trump’s conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, said the fake electors scheme originated in Wisconsin.\n\nThe Wisconsin complaint details how Troupis, Chesebro and Roman created a document that falsely said Trump had won Wisconsin’s 10 Electoral College votes and then attempted to deliver the document to then-Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nThe Trump associates have argued that no crime took place. But the judge in August rejected their arguments in allowing the case to proceed.\n\nA judge threw out a similar case in Michigan in September. And last year, a special prosecutor dropped a federal case alleging Trump conspired to overturn the 2020 election. A Georgia election interference case was dropped by prosecutors earlier last month, and another similar case remains in Nevada.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge investigating whether Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem should face a contempt charge over flights carrying migrants to El Salvador said Monday he wants to hear from a whistleblower and top Justice Department official.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington ordered the government to make Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign available for testimony on Dec. 16. Boasberg wants to hear a day earlier from fired Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni.\n\nThe order for testimony ratchets up the extraordinary clash between the judicial and executive branches.\n\nIn March, Boasberg ordered the Republican administration to turn around two planes carrying Venezuelan migrants.\n\nInstead, the planes landed in El Salvador hours later, touching off the contempt probe. Boasberg is trying to determine whether the administration willfully ignored his order and should be referred for prosecution on a contempt charge.\n\nReuveni has filed a whistleblower complaint alleging a Justice Department official suggested the Trump administration might have to ignore court orders as it prepared to deport Venezuelan migrants it accused of being gang members. The administration has said the allegations are untrue.\n\nThe Justice Department has said Ensign conveyed Boasberg’s oral order and a subsequent written order to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIn a written declaration submitted to the court Friday, Noem said she made the decision not to return the planes to the U.S. after receiving “privileged legal advice” from the Homeland Security Department’s acting general counsel and “through him from the senior leadership of the Department of Justice.”\n\nBoasberg, who was nominated to the federal bench by President Barack Obama, a Democrat, called Noem’s declaration “cursory.”\n\n“As this declaration does not provide enough information for the Court to determine whether her decision was a willful violation of the Court’s Order, the Court cannot at this juncture find probable cause that her actions constituted criminal contempt,” the judge wrote in Monday's order.\n\nThe administration has said it did not violate Boasberg’s order. The judge’s directive to return the planes was made verbally in court but not included in his written order, government attorneys said in a court filing in November.\n\nThat order blocked the administration from removing “any of the individual Plaintiffs from the United States for 14 days,” but said nothing about the flights already airborne, they said.\n\nThe two planes had already departed U.S. territory and airspace, so the migrants aboard them had already been “removed” and therefore fell outside of the court’s order, Justice Department lawyers said in the court filing.\n\nJustice Department attorneys in a court filing Friday objected to any “live testimony,” urging Boasberg instead to “proceed promptly” with a criminal contempt referral if he believed his order was “sufficiently clear in imposing an obligation to halt the transfer of custody for detainees who had already been removed from the United States.”",
