    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge has allowed a Tufts University student from Turkey to resume research and teaching while she deals with the consequences of having her visa revoked by the Trump administration, leading to six weeks of detention.\n\nThe arrest of Rümeysa Öztürk, a PhD student studying children's relationship to social media, was among the first as the Trump administration began targeting foreign-born students and activists involved in pro-Palestinian advocacy. She had co-authored an op-ed criticizing her university’s response to Israel and the war in Gaza. Caught on video in March outside her Somerville residence, immigration enforcement officers took her away in an unmarked vehicle.\n\nÖztürk has been out of a Louisiana immigrant detention center since May and back on the Tufts campus. But she's been unable to teach or participate in research as part of her studies because of the termination of her record in the government's database of foreign students studying temporarily in the U.S.\n\nIn her ruling Monday, Chief U.S. District Judge Denise J. Casper wrote that Öztürk is likely to succeed on claims that the termination was “arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law and in violation of the First Amendment.”\n\nGovernment argued that termination was legal\n\nThe government’s lawyers unsuccessfully argued that the Boston federal court lacked jurisdiction and that Öztürk’s Student and Exchange Visitor Information System record (SEVIS) record was terminated legally after her visa was revoked, making her eligible for removal proceedings.\n\n“There’s no statute or regulation that’s been violated by the termination of the SEVIS record in this case,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Sauter said during a hearing last week. The Associated Press sent an email Tuesday seeking comment from Sauter on whether the government plans to appeal.\n\nIn a statement, Öztürk, who plans to graduate next year, said while she is grateful for the court's decision, she feels “a great deal of grief” for the education she has been “arbitrarily denied as a scholar and a woman in my final year of doctoral studies.”\n\n“I hope one day we can create a world where everyone uses education to learn, connect, civically engage and benefit others — rather than criminalize and punish those whose opinions differ from our own,” said Öztürk, who is still challenging her arrest and detention.\n\nThe then-30-year-old was one of four students who wrote the opinion piece in the campus newspaper. It criticized the university’s response to student activists demanding that Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel.\n\nÖztürk, who is Muslim, was meeting friends in March for iftar, a meal that breaks a fast at sunset during Ramadan, according to her lawyer, Mahsa Khanbabai. Her student visa had been revoked several days earlier, but she was not informed of that, her lawyers said. The government asserted that terminating her SEVIS record two hours after her arrest was a proper way of informing Tufts University about her visa revocation.\n\nA State Department memo said Öztürk's visa was revoked following an assessment that her actions “‘may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization’ including co-authoring an op-ed that found common cause with an organization that was later temporarily banned from campus.”\n\nÖztürk running out of time to pursue teaching, research goals\n\nWithout her SEVIS status reinstated, Öztürk said she couldn't qualify as a paid research assistant and couldn't fully reintegrate into academic life at Tufts.\n\n“We have a strange kind of legal gaslighting here, where the government claims it’s just a tinkering in a database, but this is really something that has a daily impact on Ms. Öztürk’s life,” her attorney, Adriana Lafaille of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, said in court.\n\n“We are running out of time to make this right. Each day that goes by is a day that she is being prevented from doing the work that she loves in the graduate program that she came here to be part of. Each day that this happens is a day that the government is allowed to continue to punish her for her protected speech.”\n\nÖztürk, meanwhile, has maintained a full course load and fulfilled all requirements to maintain her lawful student status, which the government hasn't terminated, her lawyer said.\n\nRecord created to collect information on international students\n\nSEVIS is mandated by Congress in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 and administered by the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement “to collect information relating to nonimmigrant foreign students” and “use such information to carry out the enforcement functions of” ICE.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, when a SEVIS record is terminated, a student loses all on and/ or off-campus employment authorization and allows ICE agents to investigate to “confirm the departure of the student.”\n\nMcCormack reported from Concord, New Hampshire.",

    "fullText": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin judge on Tuesday refused to step aside as requested by President Donald Trump's former attorney who faces felony forgery case related to the 2020 election in the battleground state.\n\nThe judge also refused to cancel a Monday preliminary hearing for Trump's former attorney, who also previously worked as a judge in the same county where he is being prosecuted, and two other former Trump associates.\n\nThe three former Trump aides face 11 felony charges each in relation to their roles in the 2020 fake elector scheme. They are: Jim Troupis, who was Trump’s attorney in Wisconsin in the 2020 election; Kenneth Chesebro, an attorney who advised Trump's campaign; and Mike Roman, Trump’s director of Election Day operations in 2020.\n\nTroupis, joined by the other two defendants, argued in a motion filed Monday that all of the judges in Dane County were biased against him. Troupis was a judge in the county for one year from 2015 to 2016.\n\nHe also alleged that the judge hearing his case, Dane County Circuit Judge John Hyland, had solicited help from a retired judge in writing an August order refusing to dismiss the case against him.\n\nTroupis argued in the motion that the retired judge who “carries personal animus” toward Troupis from their time together on the bench actually wrote the order. Troupis asked for an evidentiary hearing in another county.\n\nHe included an expert analysis of the writing style that compares the order to the writing style of retired Dane County Judge Frank Remington. Troupis' attorney also attached a Nov. 25 letter he wrote to Hyland claiming that other attorneys told him that Remington actually wrote the August order because the writing style matched Remington’s in a civil case they litigated before him.\n\nHyland rejected those arguments and Troupis' call for moving the case to another county.\n\n“The Court is satisfied that no person other the assigned staff attorney and I had a hand in drafting or editing the decision which this Court signed and entered,” Hyland wrote.\n\nHyland also wrote that he had “no personal animus or prejudice toward any of the litigants” and was satisfied that he could fairly hear the case. He declined to step aside as requested.\n\nHyland also said that Troupis presented no evidence to support his claim that every other judge in the country was prejudiced against him and therefore can’t fairly hear the case.\n\nTroupis’ attorney, Joe Bugni, did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nTroupis, Chesebro and Roman each face 11 felony charges for allegedly using forgery in an attempt to defraud each of the 10 Republican electors who cast their ballots for Trump in 2020 as part of a plan to submit paperwork falsely claiming that the Republican had won the battleground state that year.\n\nTrump lost Wisconsin in 2020 but fought to have the defeat overturned. He won the state in both 2016 and 2024.\n\nThe Wisconsin Department of Justice, which is prosecuting the case, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe state charges against the Trump attorneys and aide are the only ones in Wisconsin. None of the electors have been charged. The 10 Wisconsin electors, Chesebro and Troupis all settled a lawsuit that was brought against them in 2023.\n\nFederal prosecutors who investigated Trump’s conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, said the fake electors scheme originated in Wisconsin.\n\nThe Wisconsin complaint details how Troupis, Chesebro and Roman created a document that falsely said Trump had won Wisconsin’s 10 Electoral College votes and then attempted to deliver the document to then-Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nThe Trump associates have argued that no crime took place. But the judge in August rejected their arguments in allowing the case to proceed.\n\nA judge threw out a similar case in Michigan in September. And last year, a special prosecutor dropped a federal case alleging Trump conspired to overturn the 2020 election. A Georgia election interference case was dropped by prosecutors earlier last month, and another similar case remains in Nevada.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge investigating whether Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem should face a contempt charge over flights carrying migrants to El Salvador said Monday he wants to hear from a whistleblower and top Justice Department official.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington ordered the government to make Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign available for testimony on Dec. 16. Boasberg wants to hear a day earlier from fired Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni.\n\nThe order for testimony ratchets up the extraordinary clash between the judicial and executive branches.\n\nIn March, Boasberg ordered the Republican administration to turn around two planes carrying Venezuelan migrants.\n\nInstead, the planes landed in El Salvador hours later, touching off the contempt probe. Boasberg is trying to determine whether the administration willfully ignored his order and should be referred for prosecution on a contempt charge.\n\nReuveni has filed a whistleblower complaint alleging a Justice Department official suggested the Trump administration might have to ignore court orders as it prepared to deport Venezuelan migrants it accused of being gang members. The administration has said the allegations are untrue.\n\nThe Justice Department has said Ensign conveyed Boasberg’s oral order and a subsequent written order to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIn a written declaration submitted to the court Friday, Noem said she made the decision not to return the planes to the U.S. after receiving “privileged legal advice” from the Homeland Security Department’s acting general counsel and “through him from the senior leadership of the Department of Justice.”\n\nBoasberg, who was nominated to the federal bench by President Barack Obama, a Democrat, called Noem’s declaration “cursory.”\n\n“As this declaration does not provide enough information for the Court to determine whether her decision was a willful violation of the Court’s Order, the Court cannot at this juncture find probable cause that her actions constituted criminal contempt,” the judge wrote in Monday's order.\n\nThe administration has said it did not violate Boasberg’s order. The judge’s directive to return the planes was made verbally in court but not included in his written order, government attorneys said in a court filing in November.\n\nThat order blocked the administration from removing “any of the individual Plaintiffs from the United States for 14 days,” but said nothing about the flights already airborne, they said.\n\nThe two planes had already departed U.S. territory and airspace, so the migrants aboard them had already been “removed” and therefore fell outside of the court’s order, Justice Department lawyers said in the court filing.\n\nJustice Department attorneys in a court filing Friday objected to any “live testimony,” urging Boasberg instead to “proceed promptly” with a criminal contempt referral if he believed his order was “sufficiently clear in imposing an obligation to halt the transfer of custody for detainees who had already been removed from the United States.”",
