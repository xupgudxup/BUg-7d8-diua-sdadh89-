    "fullText": "At -125, Shohei Ohtani is breathing rarefied air at his current price.\n\nConsider last year, when he was the overwhelming preseason favorite to win NL MVP, and he was still only +150 by the end of March, per Sports Odds History. That was already crazy, because the shortest number we've generally seen in recent years is +200 or +300.\n\nBelow, we'll look at the early MLB odds for the 2026 season, and AL & NL MVP, as the likes of Alex Bregman (Chicago Cubs) and Kyle Tucker (Los Angeles Dodgers) have found new homes since our previous look.\n\nHere are the last 10 winners of the AL and NL MVP Award, with Shohei Ohtani leading the way as a four-time winner, with two in the AL and two in the NL. Only Frank Robinson has also won MVP awards in both leagues.\n\nBarry Bonds holds the record for most MVP awards (seven)\n\nThe New York Yankees have won the most MVPs in MLB history with 25, while the St. Louis Cardinals are second, leading all NL teams, with 21. No player for the Arizona Diamondbacks, New York Mets, or Tampa Bay Rays has ever won MVP.\n\nMost sportsbooks will display odds in the American format as listed above. When Goldschmidt ran away with the MVP award in 2022 his odds had a minus (-) sign ahead of the number for a large part of the season.\n\nThat means that a bettor in August had to wager $6,000 to win $100 by betting on Goldy to win MVP. Before the season starts, almost every player will have a plus (+) sign ahead of their odds.\n\nThat means a bettor would have profited $200 for a $100 wager on Ohtani before the season started.\n\nIf American odds aren't your thing, simply use a tool like our odds converter to switch the odds to decimal or fractional format. Most online sportsbooks also give you the option to change the odds format that you see.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

The complaint against U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg was dismissed on Dec.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal appeals court judge has dismissed a misconduct complaint filed by the Justice Department against a judge who clashed with President Donald Trump ’s administration over deportations to a notorious prison in El Salvador.\n\nThe complaint against U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg was dismissed on Dec. 19 by Jeffrey S. Sutton, chief judge of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals but the order only came to light this weekend.\n\nThe complaint stemmed from remarks that Boasberg, the chief judge in the district court in the nation’s capital, allegedly made in March 2025 to Chief Justice John Roberts and other federal judges at a judicial conference saying the administration would trigger a constitutional crisis by disregarding federal court rulings. The meeting took place days before Boasberg issued an order blocking deportation flights that Trump was carrying out by invoking wartime authorities from an 18th century law.\n\nIn the dismissal order, Sutton said the Justice Department never provided a listed attachment to provide proof of what Boasberg said or the context of the alleged statement at the closed-door conference.\n\n“A recycling of unadorned allegations with no reference to a source does not corroborate them. And a repetition of uncorroborated statements rarely supplies a basis for a valid misconduct complaint,\" said Sutton, who was appointed by President George W. Bush to the appeals court circuit that covers Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee.\n\nSpokespeople for the Justice Department and for Boasberg's court did not immediately return messages seeking comment.\n\nEven if Boasberg had made the comments, Sutton said it would not be “so far afield\" from topics discussed at the gathering and would not violate ethics rules. Sutton noted that Roberts' 2024 year-end report raised general concerns about threats to judicial independence, security concerns for judges and respect for court orders throughout the nation's history.\n\nThe misconduct complaint was filed with Judge Sri Srinivasan, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, but Srinivasan asked Roberts to transfer it to another appeals court circuit because it was still considering appeals related to the deportation case, according to the dismissal order. Roberts transferred it to the 6th Circuit, it said.",

    "fullText": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Utah Gov. Spencer Cox signed a bill Saturday that expands the state Supreme Court from five justices to seven as frustration has mounted among Republican lawmakers over a string of defeats before the tribunal.\n\nRepublican advocates for the change argued that it would help improve the court's efficiency. But legal experts said it could have the opposite effect and set a dangerous precedent at a time of tension between the branches of government. The state's judiciary did not ask for more justices on the high court.\n\nDemocrats, who were united in opposition to the bill, called timing suspicious. Last week the Legislature asked the court to overturn a redistricting ruling that gave Democrats a strong shot at picking up one of Utah’s four Republican-held congressional seats in the fall.\n\nNew justices could be in place when the court decides the fate of the congressional map.\n\nBecause the bill received approval from more than two-thirds of legislators, it took effect immediately after the governor signed it, allowing him to bypass a several-month waiting period to start adding justices.\n\nIn Utah, justices are appointed by the governor and approved by the state Senate. Justices in many other states are elected.\n\nMost states have five or seven Supreme Court justices, but a few have nine. Cox, a Republican, has said the additions would put Utah in line with other states of its size. He has denied that the policy is politically motivated, noting that Republican governors and senators have made all recent appointments.\n\nOnce he fills the new seats, Cox will have appointed five of the seven sitting justices.\n\nLast month Republican lawmakers took authority from state Supreme Court justices to select their own chief justice and gave that power to the governor.\n\n“Seven sets of eyes reviewing the most complex and difficult issues our state has ever faced is better than having only five sets of eyes,” said House Majority Leader Casey Snider, a Republican sponsor of the bill.\n\nJohn Pearce, who recently retired as associate chief justice, said this month that he doubted the change would make the court more efficient.\n\n“The more sets of comments you have to take into account, the longer the process takes,” Pearce said. “If what the Legislature is hoping to do is speed up the work of the court, it's going to be counterproductive.”\n\nTwo states — Arizona and Georgia — have added justices in the past decade after making similar arguments about efficiency.\n\nIn the first few years after Arizona grew its court in 2016, several past and present justices said it made things less efficient because more people had to review opinions before they could be published.\n\nArizona's court now issues slightly more rulings per year, while Georgia's issues slightly fewer than before.\n\nUtah Chief Justice Matthew Durrant told legislators on the opening day of the 2026 session that the court had “essentially no backlog” and urged them to add judges to lower courts, where the need is greater. Bill sponsors responded by adding some lower court judges and clerks.\n\nThe Utah State Bar has raised concern over the expansion and other proposals that it said would weaken the judiciary's independence. Among them is a bill that would create a new trial court with exclusive jurisdiction to hear constitutional challenges. The proposal would limit the ability of other judges and courts to block potentially unconstitutional state laws with injunctions.\n\nRepublicans have also been collecting signatures to try to place on the November ballot an initiative that would restore their ability to draw voting districts that deliberately favor a political party, a practice known as gerrymandering.\n\nLee reported from Santa Fe, New Mexico.",

    "fullText": "Jan 31 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court judge has dismissed a judicial misconduct complaint by U.S. Justice Department against a judge who clashed with President Donald ​Trump's administration over its move to deport several Venezuelans to El Salvador.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam ‌Bondi took the rare step in July of announcing the complaint against Chief U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington, D.C., alleging ‌he made improper comments about Trump during a meeting of the judiciary's policymaking body, the Judicial Conference.\n\nChief U.S. Circuit Judge Jeffrey Sutton of the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in a newly-released order dated December 19 said the alleged statements, even if true, would not violate judicial ethics rules.\n\nThe Justice Department did not ⁠respond on Saturday to requests for ‌comment. Boasberg, an appointee of Democratic former President Barack Obama, declined to comment.\n\nBondi announced the complaint days after Boasberg said he might initiate disciplinary proceedings against ‍Justice Department lawyers for their conduct in a lawsuit brought by Venezuelans challenging their removal to a Salvadoran prison.\n\nBoasberg in April concluded the administration appeared to have acted \"in bad faith\" when it hurriedly assembled three deportation flights ​on March 15, at the same time that he was conducting emergency court proceedings to assess ‌the effort's legality.\n\nThe DOJ's complaint focused on comments attributed to Boasberg by the conservative media outlet The Federalist during a meeting of U.S. Judicial Conference in March that was attended by Chief U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Roberts.\n\nThe Justice Department alleged Boasberg expressed his concern to Roberts and others that the administration would disregard court rulings and trigger \"a constitutional crisis.\"\n\nThe DOJ argued those comments ran afoul of the ⁠judicial code of conduct, and that Boasberg wrongly acted ​on his belief in the litigation over the Venezuelans, who ​were removed from the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nDue to potential conflicts among judges in D.C., Roberts transferred the complaint to the Cincinnati-based 6th Circuit's Judicial Council.\n\nSutton ‍said the DOJ lacked ⁠proof Boasberg made such statements, which even if uttered would not be improper during the judicial policymaking body's closed-door meeting.\n\n\"In these settings, a judge’s expression of anxiety about executive-branch compliance with ⁠judicial orders, whether rightly feared or not, is not so far afield from customary topics at these meetings—judicial independence, judicial ‌security, and inter-branch relations—as to violate the Codes of Judicial Conduct,\" Sutton wrote.",

    "fullText": "I previously wrote a post called “What Is Good Code? On the Illusion of Readability” where I discussed how subjective and context-dependent the formula “good code = readable code” really is.\n\nThe conclusion that people judge readability differently is fair enough. But if you trace the mechanics behind it — where that sense of “this is easy to read” actually comes from — you start to find some hints.\n\nSo that’s what this post is about. How humans understand code, and what makes certain forms of information feel easier to process.\n\nIn a 2020 fMRI study conducted at MIT, researchers observed which brain regions activate when programmers read code. The results were interesting.\n\nAccording to the study, reading code primarily activated the Multiple Demand Network — the region responsible for logical reasoning and complex cognitive tasks — rather than the language network. The language regions weren’t completely uninvolved, but the Multiple Demand Network response was dominant.\n\nPut simply, when our brains read code, they rely more on logical reasoning than language processing.\n\nThe study confirmed that five brain regions related to working memory, attention, and language processing showed pronounced activation during code comprehension. Meanwhile, Default Mode Network activity (the regions active when the brain is resting) decreased. In other words, reading code is a fairly expensive operation for the brain.\n\nSo far, this might seem unsurprising. But the more interesting findings come from the differences between experts and novices. Skilled developers showed lower overall brain activation levels when reading code. Not because they were trying less, but because they were processing more efficiently. Novice developers, on the other hand, showed widespread brain activation — meaning they were consciously processing nearly everything one piece at a time.\n\nNovices tended to read code like natural language text, top to bottom. Experts followed the program’s execution flow. Same code, fundamentally different processing.\n\nTo understand why some code reads easily while other code refuses to organize itself in your head, you need to know about working memory.\n\nIn 1956, cognitive psychologist George A. Miller published the famous paper “The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two”, revealing that human short-term memory capacity is roughly 7±2 items. Subsequent research has revised this downward — according to Cowan (2001) and others, the number of chunks that can be simultaneously held in working memory converges around 3–4. Though this figure can vary depending on the type of task, level of expertise, and modality of information.\n\nThink about what we load into our heads when reading code. The current value of a variable, the direction of control flow, the order of function calls, the state of the current scope — all of these occupy working memory slots. When those slots fill up, the brain struggles to take in new information. That’s the moment when you get that “this code feels complicated” sensation.\n\nTo put it in programming terms, working memory is like a fixed-size stack.\n\nReal working memory is a far more complex system than a stack, but the analogy works well enough for intuiting the key property: “there’s a capacity limit, and exceeding it causes things to break down.” The stack size is roughly 4, and exceeding it causes a stack overflow. In practice, the items occupying each slot aren’t uniform in size, and interference between items also occurs, so the exact number matters less than the fact that capacity is limited. And the moment that capacity hits its limit is exactly when you feel “this code is hard to read.”\n\nLet’s compare code that rapidly exhausts working memory with code that doesn’t.\n\nThis function isn’t wrong, but it demands too many things be held in the reader’s working memory simultaneously.\n\nThe condition on order.status, the check on order.items, the discount branching by customer.tier, the null check on the coupon, the domestic/international tax branching, the final price calculation — trying to fit all of this context into 3–4 slots is what makes the brain scream.\n\nIf we can break this context into appropriately sized units, we can save working memory slots needed to understand each operation.\n\nIn this version, the amount you need to hold in your head at each step is noticeably reduced. The behavior is identical, but by packaging information into consistent units, we control how much context occupies each working memory slot.\n\nWhen reading calculateDiscount, you only need to focus on discount logic. When reading processOrder, you can understand the overall flow without knowing each calculation’s implementation details. Each function is digestible within working memory’s capacity, which is why it feels easier to understand. This is also why proper abstraction at appropriate granularity matters in design. Of course, the reverse is also true — splitting things too finely means you spend working memory on jumping between functions and tracking context. The goal isn’t splitting for its own sake, but reducing how much you need to hold in your head at once.\n\nHere’s a natural question: if working memory only has about 4 slots, how on earth do we comprehend hundreds of lines of code?\n\nThe answer lies in a cognitive mechanism called chunking. Chunking means grouping multiple small units of information into a single meaningful cluster. According to research from the University of Zurich, chunking reduces working memory load by retrieving compressed chunk representations from long-term memory to replace individual element representations. The freed-up capacity is then used to process new incoming information.\n\nThink about phone numbers. Trying to remember 01012345678 as eleven individual digits would far exceed working memory capacity. But split it as 010-1234-5678, and you only need to remember three chunks. Better yet, if 010 is already familiar as “Korean mobile prefix,” it’s automatically processed as a single chunk, meaning you really only need to memorize two new chunks.\n\nThe same thing happens with code. Look at what happens when a skilled developer reads this:\n\nA novice developer has to load each individual element into working memory: the users variable, how .filter works, arrow function syntax, the u.isActive property access, how .map works, another arrow function…\n\nFor a skilled developer, users.filter(...).map(...) is recognized as a single chunk: “filter array then transform.” Having seen this pattern hundreds or thousands of times, they pull a stored chunk from long-term memory and use just one working memory slot. The remaining slots can be allocated to higher-level thinking like “why is this being filtered?” or “where does the result get used?”\n\nThis is the same principle that allows chess masters to glance at a board and grasp the entire situation. Chess masters don’t memorize individual piece positions one by one — they recognize familiar formation patterns as single chunks. That’s why they can quickly recall meaningfully arranged boards but perform no better than novices with randomly placed pieces.\n\nCode works the same way. Idiomatic code is easy to read not because it’s “correct,” but because it matches chunks already stored in the developer’s long-term memory.\n\nAnd what makes a pattern idiomatic is shaped by external factors: the language’s design intent, standard library conventions, and the community’s repeated choices. It’s not simply “familiar because it’s used a lot” — it’s that convergence driven by multiple forces created that familiarity. This is also why project-specific unique patterns or overly creative code are hard to read. When existing chunks don’t match, the brain has to decompose everything into individual elements for processing, and working memory saturates almost instantly.\n\nThis is where Daniel Kahneman’s dual process theory becomes relevant. Kahneman divided human thinking into two systems:\n\nMost of our everyday judgments are handled by System 1. Driving a car, or sensing your partner’s mood from a single word over the phone — that’s all System 1. When encountering new information, System 1 doesn’t create entirely new patterns; it matches against patterns already stored.\n\nWhen System 1 gets stuck, that’s when System 2 gets called in. The moment you consciously think “what is this?” and begin analyzing — that’s System 2 engaging. And when you apply this framework to code reading, it explains a remarkable amount.\n\nReadable code is code that’s mostly processed by System 1’s pattern recognition, with minimal System 2 involvement.\n\nWhen skilled developers read code, familiar patterns are handled automatically by System 1. for loops, if-else branches, map/filter/reduce chaining, try-catch blocks — these have been seen thousands of times, so they’re processed without conscious effort. System 2 stays in a comfortable low-power mode, simply approving the information that System 1 surfaces.\n\nBut when an unexpected pattern appears, things change.\n\nBoth express the same intent. But the moment you see the second version, System 1 sends an “I don’t know” signal, and System 2 begins its expensive analysis. You have to unwind the double negation, run De Morgan’s law in your head, and figure out why that final undefined check is necessary. This transition itself is a cognitive cost.\n\nKahneman called this phenomenon cognitive strain. The more System 2 intervenes, the more energy the brain consumes and the more fatigue it experiences. The subjective feeling of “hard-to-read code” is really the cognitive cost arising from pattern matching failure triggering a system switch.\n\nFrom this perspective, feedback like “this is hard to understand” in code reviews isn’t just a matter of taste — it’s closer to a signal that system-switching costs are actually occurring. The magnitude of that cost varies by individual experience and chunk composition, but the fact that the cost occurs is real.\n\nReadable code depends not only on logical structure but on visual structure as well. This is where the perceptual principles of Gestalt psychology come in.\n\nGestalt psychology studies how the human brain prioritizes perceiving overall patterns and structures over individual elements. Several of its core principles connect directly to code readability.\n\nElements that are close together are perceived as a group. Let’s look at two versions of the same code to see why this grouping matters.\n\nThe second version just adds a single blank line, yet the brain automatically recognizes two groups: “user info processing” and “permission-based data retrieval.”\n\nAccording to Gestalt research, proximity is an even stronger grouping cue than similarity of color or shape. This principle is used directly in UI design — related information is placed close together and unrelated information is spaced apart, precisely for this reason.\n\nSimilarly, the reason blank lines and indentation matter in code isn’t just aesthetics — it’s because the brain’s perceptual system uses them to parse structure.\n\nLike proximity, elements that look alike are also perceived as belonging to the same group. This explains why consistent naming matters in code.\n\nIn the first version, despite all three being the same kind of operation — data fetching — the naming conventions are inconsistent. userData, get_orders, pmtHistory each have different forms, and fetchUser, retrieveOrderList, loadPayments lack any consistency. The brain can’t recognize these as the same group and processes each line as a separate item, consuming working memory.\n\nIn the second version, the pattern is clear. The consistent fetch + resourceName structure causes all three lines to be recognized as a single chunk: “data fetching in the same pattern.”\n\nThe law of continuity states that we perceive elements as a single continuous entity when they follow a natural flow of direction. In code, this relates to the linearity of execution flow.\n\nOur brains find top-to-bottom, left-to-right flow natural. Deep nesting, complex callbacks, and scattered goto statements are hard to read because they violate the law of continuity.\n\nThis is also why early return patterns feel easier to read than nested if statements. Once edge cases are filtered out, the remaining code flows in a single direction from top to bottom.\n\nThe first version forces your eyes to zigzag right and left as indentation deepens. The brain has to maintain “which condition am I currently inside” in working memory at each nesting level.\n\nThe second version filters out exceptions first, then flows naturally from top to bottom. Because it aligns with the law of continuity, the cost for the brain to parse the structure drops significantly.\n\nThere’s a framework that systematically organizes everything discussed so far: John Sweller’s Cognitive Load Theory.\n\nAccording to this theory, cognitive load during learning or problem-solving breaks down into three types:\n\nAccording to this theory, what we should pursue when writing readable code is minimizing extraneous load.\n\nIntrinsic load can’t be reduced — it’s inherent to the problem. Code implementing a distributed consensus algorithm will be complex no matter how well it’s written. The problem to avoid is when extraneous load from “how it’s expressed” piles unnecessarily on top of intrinsic load.\n\nFrom this perspective, patterns that improve readability — consistent naming, appropriate function decomposition, clear type declarations, meaningful blank lines — are all acts of reducing extraneous cognitive load. They let the brain’s limited resources avoid being wasted on extraneous load and focus on processing intrinsic load (the actual problem).\n\nA 2023 systematic literature review found something interesting as well. Among studies investigating the relationship between source code metrics and actually measured cognitive load, few traditional code metrics showed consistently high correlation with actual cognitive load, and even when correlation was found, results tended to vary depending on task conditions and measurement methods. In other words, what we “measure” as complexity and what a developer’s brain actually “feels” as complex can be different things.\n\nThis is a significant finding. Mechanically measurable metrics capture a code’s surface-level complexity, but the cognitive load a developer’s brain actually experiences is influenced by subjective perception — pattern familiarity, chunking efficiency, and visual structural clarity.\n\nI mentioned earlier that expert and novice brain activation patterns differ. This isn’t just “more experience means you get better.” A 2024 study published in Scientific Reports measured brainwaves from 62 Python programmers while observing their neural responses to intentionally inserted syntax errors and semantic errors in code.\n\nThe results were striking. Skilled programmers showed distinct brainwave patterns for syntactic violations versus semantic violations. This parallels how the brain produces different brainwave responses to grammatical errors versus semantic errors when reading natural language. It means that programming experience forms neural circuits in the brain specialized for processing specific languages and patterns.\n\nIn other words, coding experience physically changes the brain’s structure. Through neuroplasticity, code patterns encountered repeatedly are stored as schemas in long-term memory, and these schemas become the foundation for chunking. System 1’s ability to automatically process code is the result of accumulated schemas.\n\nFurthermore, because schemas form based on the patterns an individual has been exposed to, people who repeatedly encounter the same patterns in the same codebase end up sharing similar schemas. Flip this around, and maintaining a consistent code style within a team isn’t a matter of taste — it’s the process of forming shared chunks in team members’ brains. The reason coding conventions matter isn’t just uniformity; it’s collective cognitive efficiency.\n\nOne of the theories gaining attention in recent cognitive science is predictive coding. According to this theory, the brain doesn’t passively receive information — it constantly predicts what information will come next and only performs additional processing when the actual input differs from its prediction.\n\nThe same applies when reading code. Our brains constantly predict what the next line will be.\n\nA skilled developer’s brain reading this code is already predicting “it’ll probably parse the response data and return it.” And when return response.data; actually appears, the prediction was correct, so virtually no additional cognitive cost is incurred.\n\nBut what if something completely unexpected shows up?\n\nWhat the brain predicted from the name fetchUserProfile was “a function that fetches a user profile and returns it.” But then event bus emission, localStorage writes, and analytics tracking appear — actions outside the prediction. Each time, the brain generates a prediction error signal and invokes System 2 to analyze why this code is here.\n\nThe reason the second version feels hard to read is that the function is named fetchUserProfile, but internally it does things that have nothing to do with that name. The more closely a name’s set expectation matches the actual behavior, the fewer prediction errors occur and the less cognitive cost is incurred.\n\nThis applies not just within functions but to interface design as well. Let me use component interfaces familiar to frontend developers like myself as an example.\n\nThe first component follows value, onChange, placeholder — an interface shared by virtually every input component in the React ecosystem. A developer’s System 1, having encountered this pattern countless times, processes it as “it’s an input component” and moves on.\n\nThe second uses user, setUser, blank — an interface either tightly coupled to business logic or with unclear meaning. Until you figure out which fields of the user object it touches internally and when blank is actually used, you can’t use it with confidence. You have to look at the internal implementation every time, and each time, prediction errors occur.\n\nIn other words, to write readable code, we need to maximize predictability at every level of the codebase — not just function names, but variable names, file structure, directory organization, and API design.\n\nSummarizing everything so far, the substance behind the subjective feeling of “readable code” is this:\n\nLooking at this list, you’ll notice something interesting. None of these mean “correct code.”\n\nReadability and correctness are separate axes. Code can be perfectly correct but impossible to read, and code can be easy to read but wrong. That said, readable code also makes bugs easier to find — with lower extraneous load, the brain can focus its resources on finding logical errors.\n\nThere’s one caveat, though. Kahneman also warned about System 1’s biases. System 1 is fast, but that speed comes at the cost of bias. A classic example is familiarity bias. It’s true that you feel patterns familiar to you as “readable code,” but whether that’s objectively optimal is a separate question. A developer fluent in functional programming might find for loops “hard to read,” and vice versa. In those cases, the feeling of “hard to read” may not reflect the code’s objective quality but the bias of chunks stored in your own System 1.\n\nWhen giving “this is hard to understand” feedback in code reviews, it’s worth asking yourself once: is this genuinely high-cognitive-load code, or is it simply a pattern not registered in my System 1? If the former, refactoring is needed. If the latter, it might actually be an opportunity to expand your chunk library.\n\n“Readable code” isn’t just a matter of feeling or taste. It’s a natural outcome produced by human cognitive architecture — working memory capacity limits, chunking mechanisms, dual process systems, Gestalt perceptual principles, and predictive coding.\n\nThe reason I said “readability is subjective” in my previous post comes down to exactly this. Chunking depends on individual experience, and the patterns registered in System 1 differ from person to person.\n\nWhen two people look at the same code and one finds it easy while the other finds it hard, it’s not just a difference in taste — it’s because the schemas accumulated in their brains are different. The very reason readability is inevitably subjective is embedded in our cognitive structure.\n\nMany developers stop their thinking at “good code is readable code.” But if readable code is the answer, then what exactly is readable code? That’s a question worth asking yourself, and exploring in depth. Stopping your thinking in a vague domain is the most dangerous thing of all.\n\nWhat Happens in the Brain When We Read Code\n\nChunking: The Brain’s Data Compression Algorithm\n\nSystem 1 and System 2: Intuition and Analysis\n\nGestalt Principles: How Visual Structure Affects Code Comprehension\n\nCognitive Load Theory: Three Types of Load\n\nExperience Physically Changes the Brain\n\nPredictive Coding: The Brain Doesn’t Read Code — It Predicts\n\nSo What Is “Good Code,” Really?",

    "fullText": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A federal judge warned Justice Department lawyers on Friday that they were making “dangerous” and “horrifying” statements when they said the Trump Administration can decide what part of American history to display at National Park Service sites.\n\nThe sharp exchange erupted during a hearing in Philadelphia over the abrupt removal of an exhibit on the history of slavery at the site of the former President’s House on Independence Mall.\n\nThe city, which worked in tandem with the park service on the exhibit two decades ago, was stunned to find workers this month using crowbars to remove outdoor plaques, panels and other materials that told the stories of the nine people who had been enslaved there. Some of the history had only been unearthed in the past quarter-century.\n\n“You can’t erase history once you’ve learned it. It doesn’t work that way,” said Senior U.S. District Judge Cynthia Rufe, an appointee of President George W. Bush.\n\nThe removal followed President Donald Trump’s executive order “restoring truth and sanity to American history” at the nation’s museums, parks and landmarks. In Philadelphia, the materials were put in a pickup truck and then into storage, leading Rufe to voice concerns about whether they were damaged.\n\n“Although many people feel strongly about this (exhibit) one way, other people may disagree or feel strongly another way,” said Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregory in den Berken.\n\n“Ultimately,” he said, “the government gets to choose the message it wants to convey.”\n\n“That is a dangerous statement you are making. It is horrifying to listen to,” she said. “It changes on the whims of someone in charge? I’m sorry, that is not what we elected anybody for.”\n\nRufe heard hours of testimony Friday from former city officials who had helped plan the exhibit, and said the city had kicked in $1.5 million toward the project. She plans to visit both the storage area and the site before ruling on the city’s request to have the exhibit restored. But she asked the Justice Department lawyers to ensure that nothing else is disturbed.\n\nIn den Berken said the Park Service routinely changes its exhibits and tours, and argued that the government cannot be forced to tell a certain story. But lawyers for the city and other advocates said the park service does not have “carte blanche” to interpret the nation’s history as it sees fit.\n\nThe exhibit includes biographical details about the nine people enslaved by George and Martha Washington at the presidential mansion. Now, only their names — Austin, Paris, Hercules, Christopher Sheels, Richmond, Giles, Oney Judge, Moll and Joe — remain engraved into a cement wall.\n\nMichael Coard, an attorney representing one of the advocacy groups supporting the exhibit, said the president was ignoring the power held by Congress, the judiciary and the American people.\n\n“It’s one thing to whisper that type of dictatorial power. But to send lawyers into a public courtroom to make that argument is absolutely frightening,” he said. “I'm really worried about the state of America.”\n\nRufe said she planned to rule quickly, noting the surge of visitors expected to visit the nation's birthplace this year to mark its 250th anniversary of being founded.\n\nResidents who have visited the site have shed tears, left flowers and left a handmade sign that said “Slavery was real.”",

    "fullText": "PANAMA CITY (AP) — Panama's president moved to assure the public on Friday that critical ports at both ends of the Panama Canal will continue to operate without interruption — a day after the country’s Supreme Court ruled that the concession held by a subsidiary of Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison Holdings was unconstitutional.\n\nThe court's decision late Thursday advances a U.S. aim to block any influence by China over the strategic waterway and immediately drew a sharp rebuke from Beijing.\n\nPanamanian President José Raúl Mulino said that until the court's ruling is executed — a period of time he did not specify — Panama's Maritime Authority would work with Panama Ports Company, the CK Hutchison subsidiary, to ensure continuing operations at the port.\n\nOnce the concession is formally ended, a local subsidiary of Danish logistics company A.P. Moller-Maersk will operate the ports in a transitional phase until a new concession can be bid and awarded, Mulino said.\n\n“Panama moves forward, its ports will continue operating without interruption and we will continue serving the world at the logistics center of excellence that we are,” Mulino said in a recorded video address.\n\nThe court’s ruling followed an audit by Panama’s comptroller, which alleged irregularities in the 25-year extension of the concession, granted in 2021.\n\nThe Trump administration made blocking China’s influence over the Panama Canal one of its priorities in the hemisphere. Panama was U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s first overseas stop as the United States’ top diplomat. On Friday, Rubio said on X that “the United States is encouraged by the recent Panamanian Supreme Court’s decision to rule port concessions to China unconstitutional.”\n\nDespite the insistence by Panama’s government and the canal authority that China has no influence over its operations, Rubio made clear that the U.S. viewed the operation of the ports as a national security issue. U.S. President Donald Trump had gone so far as to say Panama should return the canal to U.S. control.\n\nThe court’s brief statement gave no guidance on what would happen to the ports now.\n\nThe ruling draws backlash from Hong Kong\n\nCK Hutchison’s subsidiary, Panama Ports Company, said it has not been notified yet about the decision but insisted its concession was the result of transparent international bidding.\n\nIt said in its statement that the ruling “lacks legal basis and jeopardizes not only PPC and its contract, but also the well-being and stability of thousands of Panamanian families who depend directly and indirectly on port activity, but also the rule of law and legal certainty in the country.”\n\nIt said that it reserves all rights to proceed legally in Panama or elsewhere, but gave no more details.\n\nThe Hong Kong government firmly rejected the ruling in a statement, saying it strongly opposes any foreign government using coercive, repressive or other unreasonable means to seriously harm the business interests of Hong Kong enterprises. It said the Panamanian government should respect the spirit of contracts and provide a fair business environment.\n\n“Given the current situation in Panama, Hong Kong enterprises should carefully review their existing and future investments there,\" it said.\n\nIn Beijing, China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, told reporters that China would take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of “the Chinese company,” without elaborating on the potential steps.\n\nPolitical analyst Edwin Cabrera said once the parties are notified, the issue of what to do with the ports goes to Panama’s executive branch, specifically the Panama Maritime Authority.\n\n“I have the impression from conversations that I have had with some people that the operation (of the ports) will not stop,” Cabrera said.\n\nA sale deal that apparently angered Beijing\n\nCK Hutchison Holdings announced a deal last year to sell its majority stake in the Panamanian ports and others around the world to an international consortium that included BlackRock Inc. But the deal appeared to stall over objections by the Chinese government.\n\nThe company said last July that it was considering seeking a Chinese investor to join as a significant member of the consortium, a move that some interpreted as way to please Beijing, but CK Hutchison hasn't said more since.\n\nThe awkward position the company found itself in highlights the challenges Hong Kong business elites face in navigating Beijing’s expectations of national loyalty, especially when relations between China and the United States are strained. CK Hutchison is owned by the family of Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing.\n\nLast year, Panama’s comptroller audited the concession to the Panama Ports Company, which had held the contract to operate the ports since 1997. The concession was renewed in 2021 for 25 years, during the prior Panamanian administration.\n\nComptroller Anel Flores said the audit found payments that were not made, accounting errors and the apparent existence of “ghost” concessions operating within the ports since 2015. The company denied those allegations.\n\nThe audit determined that the irregularities had cost the government about $300 million since the concession was extended and an estimated $1.2 billion during the original 25-year contract.\n\nFlores also said the extension was granted without the required endorsement of his office.\n\nOn July 30, the comptroller challenged the Panama Ports Company’s contract to operate the ports before the Supreme Court.",

It was a federal judge with a conservative pedigree who has added a powerful voice to a saga that has stirred the nation.\n\n“ICE is not a law unto itself,” Chief U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz wrote this week, referring to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nSchiltz wasn't referring to the tactics of immigration officers, who have killed two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis, burst into homes with battering rams, smashed windows and pulled people from cars, and tossed tear gas at irate protesters.\n\nRather, after surveying other judges in his court, Schiltz was talking about the government's failure to comply with nearly 100 court orders since Jan. 1 in 74 cases in which people arrested during Operation Metro Surge have sued seeking release or other relief. Even that number, he said, is \"almost certainly substantially understated.\"\n\n“This list should give pause to anyone — no matter his or her political beliefs — who cares about the rule of law. ... ICE has every right to challenge the orders of this Court, but, like any litigant, ICE must follow those orders unless and until they are overturned or vacated,” Schiltz wrote.\n\nTricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Homeland Security Department, called Schiltz's declaration a “diatribe from this activist judge.\"\n\n“We will not be deterred by activists either in the streets or on the bench,” she said in a statement.\n\nDeputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller also slammed the judge’s comments on social media: “The judicial sabotage of democracy is unending.”\n\nSchiltz is among several judges who have called out the federal government and tried to keep officials accountable during a remarkable surge of immigration enforcement. U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez prohibited officers from using tear gas or pepper spray against peaceful protesters in Minnesota, though an appeal has put it on hold.\n\nIn November, a Chicago federal judge put similar limits on the use of force and said a Border Patrol commander lied about threats faced by officers. An appeals court halted the remedy, and the lawsuit was recently dropped as tensions eased.\n\nSchiltz, 65, has been a judge for about 20 years after being nominated by Republican President George W. Bush. He served as a law clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a noted conservative jurist, and was a practicing attorney and law professor.\n\n“This is not a judge who courts controversy,” said Mark Osler, a former federal prosecutor who teaches law at the University of St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis.\n\n“He has a deep belief in the rule of law,\" Osler said. “Our social contract includes that when government officials are ordered by the courts to do something, there should be a good faith effort to make that happen. When we lose that we lose the accountability for government that an ordered society requires.\"\n\nOn Monday, Schiltz said he was taking the “extraordinary” step of ordering ICE's acting director, Todd Lyons, to appear and explain why he should not be held in contempt for the agency's failure to comply with orders. The Department of Homeland Security responded by calling him an “activist judge.” Schiltz canceled the hearing after an immigrant in that case was released.\n\nSchiltz acknowledged to Fox News Digital that he has donated to Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, which gives free counsel to immigrants, and Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid. He said he believes poor people should get access to legal help.",

Garnett dismissed the two death penalty-eligible counts against Mangione.\n\nInstead, Mangione will face two fatal stalking counts at a trial that could begin in October: crossing state lines to cause Thompson's death, and using the internet to plan and carry out the CEO's death.\n\nBoth charges carry a maximum possible punishment of life in prison without parole.\n\nIn her order, Garnett used the word \"absurdity\" to describe the \"legal infirmities\" of the two charges she dismissed.\n\nBoth charges had required proof of stalking as being, in itself, a crime of violence, a requirement she said prosecutors failed to demonstrate.\n\nDuring the months he allegedly planned the murder, Mangione failed to place the CEO \"in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily harm\" or cause him \"emotional distress,\" as required by the statute, she wrote.\n\nThompson was unaware of Mangione's actions prior to being shot from behind outside a Manhattan hotel on December 4, 2024, according to prosecutors' own account of the killing.\n\n\"The stalking offenses charged in counts one and two are not 'crimes of violence' as a matter of law, and counts three and four must be dismissed,\" she wrote.\n\nProsecutors said Friday that they have not decided if they will appeal the judge's ruling.\n\nUS Attorney Pam Bondi announced in April that prosecutors will seek the death penalty.\n\n\"Luigi Mangione's murder of Brian Thompson — an innocent man and father of two young children — was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America,\" Bondi wrote then.\n\n\"After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump's agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again.\"\n\nIn a separate ruling Friday morning, the judge said she would allow the jury to see the most serious evidence against Mangione: The contents of his backpack, which, upon his arrest, contained a gun and a journal linked to the killing.",

    "description": "Luigi Mangione will not face the death penalty after a U.S. judge on Friday dismissed murder and weapons charges against the accused",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Luigi Mangione will not face the death penalty after a U.S. judge on Friday dismissed murder and weapons charges against the accused killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian ​Thompson, in a major blow to federal prosecutors.\n\nU.S. District Judge Margaret Garnett in Manhattan said she felt constrained by Supreme ‌Court precedents to dismiss the murder charge, saying it was legally incompatible with the two stalking charges Mangione still faces, while acknowledging that ordinary people might be ‌dumbfounded by the outcome.\n\nMangione, 27, still faces possible life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted on the stalking charges.\n\nDominic Gentile, a federal prosecutor, told Garnett at a routine court hearing on Friday the government has not decided whether it will appeal.\n\nThompson, who led UnitedHealth Group's health insurance business, was shot and killed on December 4, 2024 outside the Hilton hotel in midtown Manhattan.\n\nMangione pleaded not guilty to all ⁠charges stemming from Thompson's death, and has been ‌jailed since his arrest in Pennsylvania five days after the killing.\n\nWhile public officials widely condemned Thompson's killing, Mangione became a folk hero of sorts to many Americans who decry high costs for medical care ‍and health insurer practices.\n\nGarnett has scheduled jury selection in the case to begin in September, with the evidence phase of trial beginning October 12.\n\nMangione has also pleaded not guilty to separate murder, weapons and forgery charges in a New York state court in Manhattan.\n\nNo trial date in that case has been ​set. Prosecutors in that case suffered their own setback in September, when the judge dismissed two terrorism-related counts against Mangione.\n\nJUDGE ACKNOWLEDGES 'TORTURED AND ‌STRANGE' LEGAL ANALYSIS\n\nIn a 39-page decision, Garnett said federal prosecutors could pursue their murder and weapons charges only if the stalking charges qualified as \"crimes of violence.\"\n\nShe said the charges did not qualify because any use of force could be achieved through reckless, as opposed to intentional, conduct.\n\nThe judge said prosecutors and Mangione agreed that this fell short of the kind of \"force\" the Supreme Court required to make out a crime of violence.\n\nGarnett acknowledged the \"apparent absurdity\" of the legal landscape, saying no one would seriously question that Mangione's alleged conduct -- crossing state ⁠lines to kill a specific healthcare executive with a handgun equipped with ​a silencer -- was violent criminal conduct.\n\nShe said her analysis may strike ordinary people, ​and many lawyers and judges, as \"tortured and strange,\" but it \"represents the court's committed effort to faithfully apply the dictates of the Supreme Court to the charges in this case. The law must be the court's only concern.\"\n\nIn ‍a separate decision, Garnett rejected Mangione's ⁠bid to exclude evidence seized from his backpack when he was arrested.\n\nMangione argued that evidence found in the backpack, including a 9-millimeter pistol, silencer and journal entries, should be suppressed because police obtained it without a warrant.\n\nThe judge said it ⁠was standard practice for local police to search closed bags that might reasonably contain dangerous objects, and the police had probable cause to conduct a search. She ‌also said the contents would have been discovered inevitably through a federal search warrant.",

I am pretty calm. We have shown what we are capable of as a team.\"\n\nJoshua Zirkzee remains at the centre of interest as it remains to be seen if he returns to Italy, with Juventus considering whether to make a move for the former Bologna forward who cost United £36.5m 18 months ago.\n\nZirkzee has recovered from a minor injury and is available for the Fulham game.\n\n\"Josh has just been trying to work to get fit,\" said Carrick. \"It was great to have him training with the group the first time and I am just looking forward to working with him.\"\n\nCarrick accepts the issue of Bruno Fernandes' future is \"on the agenda a little bit\", with the United captain due to assess his plans at the end of the season.\n\nHowever, Carrick said that situation would be dealt with \"further down the line\".",

    "fullText": "EL PASO, Texas (KTSM) — El Paso District Court Judge Marlene Gonzalez is stepping back from cases involving migrant children, following allegations that she behaved impartially and prejudiced toward them in hearings.\n\n“As a judge, the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct prevents me from submitting to an interview or commenting on a case that I have recused myself from hearing. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to provide this response,” read a statement from Gonzalez who noted she voluntarily recused herself from hearings regarding unaccompanied migrant children’s cases.\n\nOn Dec. 17, 2025, attorneys from Estrella del Paso – an immigrant advocacy organization – filed a motion to recuse Gonzalez from hearings involving unaccompanied migrant children – children entering the U.S. illegally and without a parent or guardian.\n\nIn the court filing, attorneys and social services workers with the organization submitted written declarations detailing allegations that Gonzalez showed a “pattern and practice of cruelty” towards migrant children during the hearings.\n\nThe declarations made allegations that Gonzalez would subject children to humiliating interrogations about why they left their country, and that on multiple occasions she shamed the children for abandoning their parents.\n\nIn one account an attorney alleged that Gonzalez interrogated a 17-year-old Guatemalan boy who testified that he fled his country to Mexico from an abusive alcoholic father, but that he was kidnapped and beat up twice while in Mexico. The attorney alleged that in response, Gonzalez “harangued” the boy: “Why didn’t you stay in another part of Mexico? It’s beautiful, and it’s big. Why didn’t you stay in another part of Mexico?” the document read.\n\nIn another hearing involving a 16-year old Venezuelan girl from Venezuela who had been a victim of child prostitution, an attorney alleged that Gonzalez scolded the child “not to engage in prostitution.”\n\nThe filing went on to note that despite these alleged practices by Gonzalez, she would “unexpectedly” grant children their petitions seeking Special Immigrant Juvenile Visas, but that she recently began denying the petitions without providing any reasoning in 2025.\n\nEstrella del Paso declined an interview request with KTSM and instead offered the following statement:\n\n“For nearly 40 years, Estrella del Paso has provided legal representation and other legal services to immigrants in El Paso. We are a non-profit law firm. As attorneys, we take our legal and ethical duties to our clients very seriously, and we file every motion and document with the court with these duties in mind. The motion filed includes several detailed examples that our legal team took time and detailed care to compile. For accuracy and completeness, we encourage you to refer directly to that filing. We will not comment on the motions or our interactions with the court. All our clients are owed a duty of confidentiality, and we will not violate this duty, especially in the case of vulnerable children.”\n\nGonzalez’s current term runs through 2028.",

    "description": "Jeffrey Epstein's victims have accused Bank of America of facilitating Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking operation.",
    "fullText": "Sex trafficking victims of Jeffrey Epstein scored a mixed victory in court on Thursday after a federal judge tossed one of their lawsuits against a bank — but greenlit part of another case against a different bank.\n\nUS District Judge Jed Rakoff allowed portions of a proposed class-action lawsuit filed by victims against Bank of America to move forward, but dismissed other parts of the case.\n\nRakoff dismissed the entirety of a similar lawsuit the victims had filed against another bank, BNY.\n\nThe Epstein victims had accused Bank of America of ignoring red flags for Epstein's sex-trafficking operation. Their lawsuit said the bank facilitated millions of dollars — including over $170 million from former Apollo CEO Leon Black, who said he paid Epstein for tax advice — into Epstein's accounts. They said the funds were used in part to pay hush money to victims.\n\nRakoff dismissed the parts of the lawsuit that alleged the bank \"knowingly participated\" in Epstein's sex-trafficking operation, as well as allegations that it failed to follow know-your-customer laws in monitoring Epstein's accounts.\n\nBut the judge allowed the victims' claims that Bank of America was a \"knowing beneficiary\" of the sex-trafficking operation to move forward.\n\nThe judge tossed an entire lawsuit that the same lawyers filed against BNY, also known as Bank of New York Mellon Corp. The lawsuit had alleged BNY ignored red flags while processing Epstein's wire transfers and by extending credit to a modeling agency financed by Epstein and owned by Jean-Luc Brunel, who died in his prison cell in 2022 while awaiting trial in France for rape charges.\n\nDavid Boies, an attorney representing the Epstein victims, said he would appeal the dismissal of the BNY lawsuit.\n\n\"We are pleased that the Court sustained our sex trafficking claims against Bank of America, and we look forward to trying that case in May,\" Boies said in a statement. \"We respectively disagree with the Court's dismissal of the complaint against Bank of New York Mellon and we will seek appellate review.\"\n\nRakoff had expressed skepticism about the strength of both lawsuits during a December hearing in his lower Manhattan courtroom. He called them both \"a model of high-pitched rhetoric\" and compared them unfavorably to earlier lawsuits the same attorneys had brought on behalf of Epstein victims against JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, which settled for $290 million and $75 million, respectively.\n\nAt the end of the December hearing, Rakoff gave the lawyers two weeks to file amended versions of their lawsuits with more detail.\n\nThe revisions appeared not to satisfy Rakoff. He dismissed the counts \"with prejudice\" — meaning the lawyers won't get another chance to amend their lawsuits — and said he would issue an opinion explaining his reasoning by February 13.\n\n\"We are pleased with the court's decision dismissing the lawsuit in its entirety, which reinforces that BNY had no involvement in Epstein's crimes,\" BNY spokesperson Ryan Wells told Business Insider. \"BNY has great sympathy for the victims of Jeffrey Epstein and believes his crimes should be fully investigated and prosecuted.\"\n\nIn court, Bank of America lawyers said it offered nothing more than \"routine banking services\" for Epstein. Bill Haldin, a spokesperson for the bank, said it looked forward to \"a full review of the facts\" as the case moved forward.\n\n\"We are pleased the court dismissed most of the claims,\" Haldin said. \"On the remaining claims, it's important to understand the underlying facts have not been reviewed at this stage of the litigation.\"\n\nRakoff had previously put the lawsuits on a fast track, setting deadlines for summary judgment for the spring, which will give Bank of America another chance to have the case dismissed. A trial is scheduled for May.\n\nThe litigation is playing out in the same courthouse where victims have pressed judges to force the Department of Justice to publish its internal files related to Epstein, the well-connected pedophile who killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex-trafficking charges.\n\nThe Justice Department has blown past a December 19 deadline required by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed in November, to release all of its files. Victims and members of Congress have asked judges to appoint an independent monitor to oversee the release of the files. Judges have said they don't have the power to make such an appointment.\n\nIn a court filing Tuesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said the department had reviewed \"millions of pages of materials, applying redactions as appropriate\" and would publish them \"in the near term.\"",

    "description": "In a hearing, a judge advised YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson and Virtual Dining Concepts to settle their legal dispute over MrBeast Burger.",
    "fullText": "A judge urged MrBeast and his burger business partner to settle their legal battle to avoid airing \"dirty laundry\" — but paved the way for the case to go to trial.\n\nAt a hearing on Thursday, New York County Supreme Court Judge Jennifer Schecter appeared skeptical about the damages sustained by either side, both of which are suing the other. Despite that, she ruled that both cases could proceed.\n\nVDC said it looked \"forward to having our day in court.\" MrBeast's reps declined to comment.\n\nYouTube's top star, MrBeast (real name Jimmy Donaldson), launched MrBeast Burger, a largely delivery-only venture selling burgers and fried chicken sandwiches, with Virtual Dining Concepts in 2020. Donaldson hoped it would become the cornerstone of a food empire, but the partnership was plagued by tensions over undercooked orders and Donaldson's demands for more control of the business.\n\nIn July 2023, Donaldson's company sued VDC, portraying the YouTuber as a victim seeking to escape an unfair contract that had tarnished his reputation as a philanthropic, family-friendly entertainer. VDC fired back with its own lawsuit, saying Donaldson had walked away from a promising deal and failed to meet various contractual obligations, including appearances and promos.\n\nA big issue for the judge was the level of damages claimed by both sides. She said the evidence presented by MrBeast about bad Yelp reviews over MrBeast Burger orders seemed \"very compelling.\" But she said she was \"very skeptical\" that they \"would materially and irreparably harm the MrBeast brand under the circumstances.\"\n\nThe judge took special interest in MrBeast's argument that VDC owes him royalties over burger sales.\n\nVDC says MrBeast's camp instructed the company to reinvest his royalty share back into the business. MrBeast's side says it's entitled to royalties now that the partnership has fallen apart.\n\nThe judge urged the parties to think about seeking a business solution rather than a legal one, given the cost of fighting the case in court.\n\n\"If they can't take each other anymore, they should be thinking about a buyout, and it may be costly, but at the end of the day, maybe that's what these parties both should want,\" she said.\n\nThe judge also admitted some fascination with the case involving the world's biggest YouTuber and his ill-fated business venture.\n\nDuring the hour-and-a-half hearing, MrBeast's lawyer, Steven Marenberg, alleged that the burger complaints harmed the YouTuber's reputation.\n\nHe said the \"systemic, deep\" dissatisfaction with MrBeast Burger could \"impact, irreparably,\" the YouTuber's brand.\n\nShawn Rabin, VDC's lawyer, countered by claiming that MrBeast wanted to lower the value of the business so he could \"buy it on the cheap\" and take control of it.",

    "fullText": "A federal appeals court ruled late Wednesday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it ended legal protections that gave hundreds of thousands of people from Venezuela permission to live and work in the United States.\n\nA three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that found Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem exceeded her authority when she ended temporary protected status for Venezuelans.\n\nThe decision, however, will not have any immediate practical effect after the U.S. Supreme Court in October allowed Noem's decision to take effect pending a final decision by the justices.\n\nAn email late Wednesday night to the Department of Homeland Security was not immediately returned.\n\nThe 9th Circuit panel also upheld the lower court's finding that Noem exceeded her authority when she decided to end TPS early for hundreds of thousands of people from Haiti.\n\nA federal judge in Washington is expected to rule any day now on a request to pause the termination of TPS for Haiti while a separate lawsuit challenging it proceeds. The country’s TPS designation is scheduled to end on February 3.\n\nNinth Circuit Judges Kim Wardlaw, Salvador Mendoza, Jr. and Anthony Johnstone said in Wednesday's ruling that the TPS legislation passed by Congress did not give the secretary the power to vacate an existing TPS designation. All three judges were nominated by Democratic presidents.\n\n“The statute contains numerous procedural safeguards that ensure individuals with TPS enjoy predictability and stability during periods of extraordinary and temporary conditions in their home country,” Wardlaw, who was nominated by President Bill Clinton, wrote for the panel.\n\nWardlaw said Noem's “unlawful actions have had real and significant consequences” for Venezuelans and Haitians in the United States who rely on TPS.\n\n“The record is replete with examples of hard-working, contributing members of society — who are mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, and partners of U.S. citizens, pay taxes, and have no criminal records — who have been deported or detained after losing their TPS,” she wrote.\n\nTemporary Protected Status, or TPS, authorized by Congress as part of the Immigration Act of 1990, allows the Homeland Security secretary to grant legal immigration status to people fleeing countries experiencing civil strife, environmental disaster or other “extraordinary and temporary conditions” that prevent a safe return to that home country.\n\nDesignations are granted for terms of six, 12 or 18 months, and extensions can be granted so long as conditions remain dire. The status prevents holders from being deported and allows them to work, but it does not give them a path to citizenship.\n\nIn ending the protections, Noem said that conditions in both Haiti and Venezuela had improved and that it was not in the national interest to allow immigrants from the two countries to stay on for what is a temporary program.\n\nMillions of Venezuelans have fled political unrest, mass unemployment and hunger. The country is mired in a prolonged crisis brought on by years of hyperinflation, political corruption, economic mismanagement and an ineffectual government.\n\nHaiti was first designated for TPS in 2010 after a catastrophic magnitude 7.0 earthquake killed and wounded hundreds of thousands of people, and left more than 1 million homeless. Haitians face widespread hunger and gang violence.\n\nMendoza wrote separately that there was “ample evidence of racial and national origin animus” that reinforced the lower court's conclusion that Noem's decisions were “preordained and her reasoning pretextual.”\n\n“It is clear that the Secretary’s vacatur actions were not actually grounded in substantive policy considerations or genuine differences with respect to the prior administration’s TPS procedures, but were instead rooted in a stereotype-based diagnosis of immigrants from Venezuela and Haiti as dangerous criminals or mentally unwell,” he wrote.\n\nAttorneys for the government have argued the secretary has clear and broad authority to make determinations related to the TPS program and those decisions are not subject to judicial review. They have also denied that her actions were motived by racial animus.",

    "description": "Michael Harris II, Sal Stewart and Luis Robert Jr. are on the rise in our 5x5 player rankings for 2026.",
    "fullText": "Moving on from the “way too early” rankings, this is the first official edition of the top 300 for 2026. Players are ranked for 5x5 mixed leagues using a one-catcher format. I include the mixed-league disclaimer because I do reward upside, particularly past the top 200 or so.\n\n⚾️ Coming soon: MLB returns to NBC and Peacock in 2026! In addition to becoming the exclusive home of Sunday Night Baseball, NBC Sports will broadcast MLB Sunday Leadoff, “Opening Day” and Labor Day primetime games, the first round of the MLB Draft, the entire Wild Card round of the postseason, and much more.\n\n- Falling off: Grant Taylor (234th), Christian Moore (289th), Troy Johnston (296th)\n\n- Just a little update here, and it's mostly because I wanted to make my new feelings known about MacKenzie Gore after last week's trade. Gore was my No. 85 SP before getting sent to the Rangers, leaving him about 10 spots off the original top 300, but that was largely because I have the Nationals as the second worst situation for pitchers in the league. Dealing with poor defense and especially poor catching, Nationals pitchers have had ERA far in excess of their FIPs the last two years (4.72 FIP, 5.35 ERA season), and their bullpen figures to be especially poor this year.\n\nI'm not quite as sure what to make about the situation in Texas, largely because Globe Life Field has been all over the map; it had one of the best park factors for hitters in 2023, only to play as a significant pitchers' park in 2024 and an extreme one in 2025. It's been especially tough on right-handed power the last two years. Maybe that won't keep up, but if it does, it's especially great for a left-handed flyball pitcher like Gore. As a result, I have Gore all of the way up to 35th among SPs now, and he checks in at No. 135 overall here.\n\n- The other significant change is Seranthony Domínguez going from 26th to 21st among RPs after signing on to close for the White Sox. Grant Taylor fell from 23rd to 28th, leaving him just off the list. I wasn't projecting him for many saves in the first place, but this does take away some of his upside. I still think he'll be fantastic in a multi-inning setup role.\n\n- Moore and Johnston lost some playing time in my projections with the Angels re-signing Yoán Moncada and the Rockies acquiring Edouard Julien. Julien could play second for Colorado, but he's a liability there. I have him slightly outhitting Johnston, though his limited home run and steal potential keeps him off the list.\n\n- Harrison Bader didn't make the top 300 while he was still a free agent, and though he'll obviously be a regular in San Francisco, he's further away now after joining the Giants.\n\n- Having Michael Harris II ranked 30th overall isn’t something I saw coming when I started doing my projections. I’ve been just as disappointed by his lack of progress as everyone else; his OPS has gone from .853 in his rookie season to .808, .722 and .678 the last three years. And yet I found so much more to be encouraged about than I thought I would, enough to think that he’s quite a bit more likely to duplicate his second half of 2025 (.299/.315/.430, 14 HR) than his first half (.210/.234/.317). He scores this highly for me even though, because I have him batting seventh, he’s projected for the second fewest plate appearances of anyone in my top 50 hitters (only Jazz Chisholm Jr. has fewer). If he gets off to a nice start and finds himself moving up the Braves lineup, I think the potential is there for him to be the steal of the year.\n\n- Sal Stewart’s placement here at No. 57 is another one that’ll raise eyebrows. I’m actually rather disappointed the Reds traded Gavin Lux, since that should help Stewart’s ADP some. Really, though, I wasn’t worried about Lux or anyone else being in Stewart’s way, no matter how hesitant Terry Francona was to use him last September. Stewart just hammers the baseball in a way that separates him from everyone else on the Reds roster, save Elly De La Cruz. He’ll bat lower in the order initially, but he could quickly settle into the cleanup spot. There’s no reason he can’t make a run at 100 RBI, and his value would only increase if the Reds get him some extra position eligibility by playing him at third or second.\n\n- Luis Robert Jr. moved up about 15 spots to No. 74 with Tuesday's trade to the Mets. Citi Field is a little bit of an upgrade for him in the ballpark department, and he's certainly in a better lineup now, even if the trade means he's more likely to spend most of the year batting in the bottom half of the order. On the plus side, that will free him up to continue stealing bases.\n\n- Neither the Robert addition nor the Bo Bichette signing did anything for one of my favorite picks this year, Brett Baty. Still, I'm keeping the faith. Baty is athletic enough to handle left field, and even if Carson Benge emerges there, I'd still take Baty over Mark Vientos as a DH against right-handers. Baty showed 25-homer power last season, and his contract rates are a little better than his strikeout percentages suggest. If he can get the ball into the air with a little more frequency this year, he should bust out.\n\n- On the White Sox side of things, Lenyn Sosa (No. 219) and Brooks Baldwin (no. 268) both moved up with Robert out of the mix. Luisangel Acuña seems poised for a shot to replace Robert in center, but while he could steal 40 bags as an everyday guy, I think his bat will probably force him into a utility role. Sosa isn't necessarily a good regular for a major league team, either, given his middling defense and atrocious walk rate, but he hit 22 homers last season and managed a solid .264 average in the process. He ought to be the White Sox's primary DH. Baldwin seems like an unexciting, jack-of-all-trades sort, but his EV numbers took a nice jump last year and he's gone 9-for-9 stealing bases in 136 big-league games. He could be a sneaky 15 HR/15 SB guy if he's in the lineup most of the time.\n\n- I was already lower than most on Freddy Peralta for this season, and the trade to the Mets didn't help, dropping him from 27th to 35th among starting pitchers. Still, it would have been considerably worse if the Mets hadn't upgraded their defense this winter. The Brewers are just so strong there and, aided by their ballpark, make their hurlers appear better than they actually are; their pitchers have a league-low .274 BABIP over the last three years, with Peralta himself coming in at .265.\n\n- There are still only 27 relievers in the top 300, though that number will swell as closing situations start to clear up a little this spring. The unrepresented teams are the Athletics, Diamondbacks, Nationals, Rangers, Rockies and Twins, while the Brewers and Astros each have two relievers on the list. Also present is free agent Serathony Domínguez, who I suspect will wind up closing for one of those unrepresented teams (or maybe the White Sox). The relievers on those clubs closest to making the list were Arizona's Kevin Ginkel (34th among RPs), the Athletics' Mark Leiter Jr. (37th), the Twins' Cole Sands (42nd) and the Rockies' Victor Vodnik (47th).",

    "fullText": "Members of a motorcycle club and a street gang clearly targeted an Indiana judge for assassination, police said Tuesday, days after officers arrested five people in connection with the attack.\n\nPolice and prosecutors at a news conference praised what they characterized as a relentless effort to track down who opened fire on Tippecanoe County Superior Court Judge Steven Meyer and his wife, Kim, at their home in Lafayette on Jan. 18. Both Meyer and his wife suffered gunshot wounds but survived.\n\nThe Lafayette Police Department, the FBI, the Indiana State Police and the Purdue University Police Department launched a search for the shooter that went on for days before apprehending five people in synchronized arrests Thursday evening, including four in Indiana and one in Lexington, Kentucky. Court appearances for the suspects were set for Wednesday in Indiana and Kentucky.\n\n“This attack was more than an assault on two citizens,” LaFayette Police Chief Scott Galloway said. “This was an assault on the rule of law itself.”\n\nProsecutors allege that the attack was designed to derail a domestic abuse case against Thomas Moss, a member of the Detroit-based Phantom MC motorcycle club with ties to the Vice Lords street gang.\n\nAccording to a probable cause affidavit, the Vice Lords offered the victim in the case $10,000 not to testify against Moss but she refused.\n\nWith Moss' trial set to begin on Jan. 20 in front of Meyer, another Phantom MC member, Blake Smith, purchased a shotgun. A masked man traveled to the Meyers' home armed with that shotgun on Jan. 18. He lured the couple to the door by saying he was looking for his dog, shot them through the door and fled.\n\n“(Meyer) was targeted,” Indiana State Police Lt. Col. Al Williamson said at Tuesday's news conference. “They went after him for a reason.”\n\nPolice recovered the mask, the shooter's clothing and the shotgun discarded near the Meyers' home. DNA on the mask matched Raylen Ferguson, an associate of the Almighty Vice Lord Nation from Lexington, Kentucky, according to the affidavit.\n\nSurveillance video showed a car that was parked near the Meyers' home had traveled from Kentucky toward Lafayette on Jan. 16 and traveled toward Smith's residence in the hour after the shootings, according to the affidavit.\n\nMoss, Ferguson and Smith each face multiple charges, including attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Amanda Milsap, whom prosecutors allege offered the bribe in the domestic abuse case, faces bribery and obstruction counts. Zeneda Greer, a woman Ferguson lives with, has been charged with helping a criminal and obstruction. Prosecutors have accused her of traveling to Lafayette with Ferguson.\n\nMilsap's attorney, Earl McCoy, didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Online court records did not list attorneys for Moss, Ferguson or Blake. Jail records indicate Greer is being held in Lexington. Online court records in that state did not list an attorney for her.",

    "fullText": "Patrick Schiltz, Minnesota’s chief federal judge, on Monday ordered Todd Lyons, the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to appear personally before the court Friday, acknowledging that the order marked an “extraordinary step.”\n\nThe order stems from the case of a man who has been in immigration detention since he was arrested earlier this month. Schiltz noted that on Jan. 14 the court told the Trump administration to provide the man with a bond hearing within seven days, noting that if they didn’t meet that deadline, the man would have to be immediately released. The judge said the administration did neither of those things and the man remains in custody as of Monday evening.\n\nPolitics: Fox News Host Grills Kristi Noem With Devastating Question On Alex Pretti Shooting\n\n“This is one of dozens of court orders with which respondents have failed to\ncomply in recent weeks,” Schiltz wrote in his brief order.\n\nThe judge noted that the court has been “extremely patient” with the administration, even though it launched its immigration enforcement operation in the state without making any provisions for the hundreds of lawsuits that would inevitably arise as a result.\n\nSchiltz, an appointee of former Republican President George W. Bush, went on to condemn the administration for failing to follow through on its pledges to obey judicial orders and take the steps required to do so.\n\n“The Court’s patience is at an end,” he warned. “Accordingly, the Court will order Todd Lyons, the Acting Director of ICE, to appear personally before the Court and show cause why he should not be held in contempt of Court.”\n\nPolitics: Harry Enten Names The Trump Official Who Is A 'Political Disaster' Right Now\n\n“The Court acknowledges that ordering the head of a federal agency to personally appear is an extraordinary step, but the extent of ICE’s violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have been tried and failed,” he added.\n\nLike this article?

Last week, Schiltz ripped the Justice Department over the approach it took to bring charges against former CNN anchor Don Lemon and four others in connection with an anti-ICE protest in St. Paul.\n\nSchiltz declined to reverse a lower court’s ruling rejecting DOJ’s demand, but the department chose to further escalate the matter, urging the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals to order Schiltz to act.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is headed to Iowa on Tuesday as part of the White House’s midterm-year pivot toward affordability, even as his administration remains mired in fallout over a second fatal shooting by federal immigration officers in in Minneapolis.\n\nIn a display of reducing tensions, Trump said he had “great calls” with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Jacob Frey on Monday, after federal immigration officers killed a protester for the second time in two weeks. Trump’s sudden shift toward a more conciliatory approach is just the latest in a string of moments where he's taken maximalist positions, only to appear to retreat.\n\nThe Trump White House has tried to blame Democratic leaders for the protests. But after videos suggest his administration wrongly labeled ICU nurse Alex Pretti an active threat to the ICE agents who shot him, the administration is trying to recalibrate its crackdown, putting White House border czar Tom Homan in charge of its Minnesota immigration operations among other moves and announcing that Greg Bovino was leaving the city.\n\nThe chief federal judge in Minnesota, meanwhile, ordered Todd Lyons, the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to appear before him Friday to explain why he shouldn’t be held in contempt for Trump administration failures to hold hearings for detained immigrants.\n\nTrump disputes staff and says slain Alex Pretti was not an ‘assassin’\n\nTrump was asked if the killed Minneapolis protester was an “assassin” as a key aide has claimed and the president answered “no.”\n\nThe president added, however, that protesters “can’t have guns” as Pretti did and “it’s just a very unfortunate incident.” Trump has said he wants the death investigated.\n\nOn Saturday, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller on social media described Pretti as an “assassin” who “tried to murder federal agents.” Vice President JD Vance shared the post on X as well.\n\nTrump says he’s going to be ‘watching over’ investigation into Pretti’s killing, which he calls ‘very sad’\n\nThe president was asked as he left the White House on Tuesday whether he thought Pretti’s killing was justified and he responded by saying that a “big investigation” was underway.\n\n“I want to see the investigation. I’m going to be watching over it, and I want a very honorable and honest investigation. I have to see it myself,” he said.\n\nHe was also asked about Pretti’s family and said in response, he said: “I love everybody. I love all of our people. I love his family. And it’s a very sad situation.”\n\nTrump says Noem isn’t going to resign\n\nAsked by reporters as he left the White House on Tuesday for a trip to Iowa whether Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is going to step down, Trump had a one-word answer: “No.”\n\nDemocrats in Congress have called for Noem’s exit after federal agents fatally shot two people in Minneapolis protesting immigration enforcement actions.\n\nTrump sent his border czar Tom Homan to Minneapolis and said on Tuesday that Homan was meeting with both the mayor and Minnesota governor.\n\nMinnesota resident says ‘world-changing events’ so close to home have been ‘overwhelming’\n\nChristina Leeson, who lives in the Minneapolis suburb Edina and was at Pretti’s vigil Tuesday morning, said Bovino’s leave is encouraging, though she’s hesitant to believe things are over since Tom Homan is coming in.\n\n“It’s just overwhelming, the amount of world-changing events that have happened within a 3-mile radius,” she said, referring to the death of Renee Good earlier in January, and George Floyd in 2020.\n\n“I feel like this is usually the time of year where I think we all kind of question why we live in Minnesota when it’s, you now, negative zero or below zero for weeks on end,” she said.\n\nLeeson said the way the community has come together in recent weeks has been a reminder of “the community, and how much we care for our neighbors and look out for each other, and are going to come out, and stand for what we believe is right no matter what.”\n\nWalz has made his priorities clear to Homan, governor’s office says\n\n“Governor Walz met with Tom Homan this morning and reiterated Minnesota’s priorities: impartial investigations into the Minneapolis shootings involving federal agents, a swift, significant reduction in the number of federal forces in Minnesota, and an end to the campaign of retribution against Minnesota,” the governor’s office announced.\n\n“The Governor and Homan agreed on the need for an ongoing dialogue and will continue working toward those goals, which the President also agreed to yesterday. The Governor tasked the Minnesota Department of Public Safety as the primary liaison to Homan to ensure these goals are met,” the statement said.\n\nImmigration agents still active across the Twin Cities\n\nIf they’ve changed tactics with the shift in tone from the White House, it wasn’t immediately clear in the Minneapolis and St. Paul area.\n\nThe streets appeared largely quiet Tuesday morning in South Minneapolis neighborhoods where unmarked convoys of immigration agents have been regular sights in recent weeks, including the neighborhoods where two people were killed by federal agents.\n\nBut Associated Press staff saw carloads of agents in northeast Minneapolis and in the suburb of Little Canada.\n\nEvery living former Democratic president has now addressed Pretti’s killing\n\nFormer President Joe Biden said on social media on Tuesday that the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis “betrays our most basic values as Americans.”\n\nFormer President Barack Obama said Sunday that the killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti by a U.S. Border Patrol officer should be a “wake-up call to every American” and warned that “our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault.”\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton’s statement Sunday said that “over the course of a lifetime, we face only a few moments where the decisions we make and the actions we take will shape our history for years to come.”\n\n“This is one of them,” Clinton said. “If we give our freedoms away after 250 years, we might never get them back.”\n\nCivil rights leaders to meet with Minnesota attorney general\n\nNAACP president Derrick Johnson and League of United Latin American Citizens president Roman Palomares will hold community events in Minneapolis on Tuesday before meeting with Ellison.\n\nThe events include a visit to the site where Alex Pretti was shot and killed by federal immigration officers for a “moment of reflection,” according to a press release from LULAC, and a “Community Conversation” held at NAACP’s Minneapolis headquarters.\n\nTrump immigration crackdown contributes to drop in US population growth rate\n\nTrump’s crackdown on immigration contributed to a year-to-year drop in the nation’s growth rate as the U.S. population reached nearly 342 million people in 2025, according to population estimates released Tuesday by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe 0.5% growth rate was a sharp drop from 2024’s immigration-fueled rate of almost 1%, which grew the population to an estimated 340 million.\n\nBirths outnumbered deaths last year by 519,000 people last year and 1.3 million people immigrated, compared with 2.8 million immigrants in 2024.\n\nIn the past 125 years, the lowest growth rate was during the coronavirus pandemic, when the population grew by just 0.16% in 2021. Before that, the lowest rate was just under 0.5% in 1919 during the Spanish flu.\n\n▶ Read more about how Trump policies are affecting U.S. population numbers\n\nMinnesota attorney general wants more than talk from Trump administration\n\nKeith Ellison said he hopes Trump’s “Operation Metro Surge” will end immediately. Asked on MS NOW’s “Morning Joe” Tuesday if Trump’s newly conciliatory posture has led to more federal cooperation with state and local officials in Minneapolis, Ellison said “not that I’ve seen so far.”\n\n“You should understand, Minnesota is abiding by the law as written. We, under the 10th Amendment, the federal government doesn’t have the authority to convert us into its deputies,” Ellison said. “And what the federal government has done is said, ‘well, if you don’t do it our way, we’re going to saturate your state with 4,000 ICE agents until you cry uncle and obey.’ And that’s unconstitutional and illegal.”\n\n“It’s a good thing” Trump talked with Minnesota’s governor and Minneapolis’ mayor, Ellison said. “But we need to see some results ... they’ve got to show, not just say.”\n\nBrandi Carlile donating to defense of Minnesota ICE detainees\n\nDescribing herself as “heartbroken and angry for Minnesota,” the singer-songwriter says her foundation will grant $25,000 to a Minnesota organization that provides legal defense to people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n“Over the past month, the community there has continued to set an incredible example for the rest of us, demonstrating the power of uniting to protect our neighbors and defend what is right,” she posted on Instagram Monday. “Now, more than ever, it is vital that we continue to hold each other and take action to stop the hate that is spreading through our country.”\n\nCarlile said the Looking Out Foundation is granting the money to help The Advocates for Human Rights provide free legal assistance to detainees.\n\nFetterman calls on Trump to fire Noem\n\nPennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman is calling on Trump to fire Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem after federal agents fatally shot two protesters in Minneapolis.\n\n“Americans have died,” Fetterman said in a direct appeal to Trump. “She is betraying DHS’s core mission and trashing your border security legacy.”\n\nFetterman, a Democrat who has increasingly voted with Republicans, said Trump should “NOT make the mistake President Biden made for not firing a grossly incompetent DHS Secretary.”\n\nFetterman voted with Democrats in April 2024 to dismiss a trial against Biden’s Homeland Security Secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, after he was impeached by the Republican-led House.\n\nWhat to know about Gregory Bovino\n\nThe field commander of Trump’s immigration crackdown in Minneapolis is leaving the city after federal agents fatally shot two people.\n\nBovino had been the go-to architect for the large-scale immigration crackdowns ordered by Trump and the public face of his administration’s city-by-city sweeps. The Border Patrol chief led agents in Los Angeles, Chicago and New Orleans before he headed to Minnesota in December for what the Department of Homeland Security called its largest-ever immigration enforcement operation.\n\n“We’re going to turn and burn to that next target and the next and the next and the next, and we’re not going to stop,” Bovino said in an interview.\n\n▶ Read more about Bovino’s career, methods and approach\n\nMelania Trump, on morning show, calls for unity\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump said in a Fox News interview Tuesday that Americans needed to come together as protests continue in Minneapolis.\n\n“I’m against the violence. So, if — please, if you protest, protest in peace. And we need to unify in these times,” she said.\n\nMelania Trump’s comments went beyond her husband’s in calling for calm, though he has softened his rhetoric in recent days while continuing to blame Democrats for the violence.\n\nShe also echoed the president’s previous statements that he had a “great call” Monday with Walz and Frey, adding they were working together to ensure protests were “without riots.”\n\nThe interview with Ainsley Earnhardt on “Fox & Friends” was pegged to the upcoming release of a new documentary about the first lady.\n\nThis item has been corrected. Melania Trump said “if you protest,” not “if we protest.”\n\nTrump says his calls with Minnesota Democratic leaders were ‘great’\n\nIn a display of reducing tensions, Trump said in a radio interview broadcast Tuesday that he had “great calls” with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Jacob Frey on Monday, after federal immigration officers killed a protester for the second time in two weeks.\n\nThe Trump White House has tried to blame Democratic leaders for the protests. But after videos suggest his administration wrongly labeled Alex Pretti an active threat to ICE agents, the administration is trying to recalibrate its crackdown, putting White House border czar Tom Homan in charge of its Minnesota immigration operations among other moves.\n\n“Actually, they were both great conversations,” the president said on the show “Sid & Friends In The Morning” on 77 WABC in New York City. “So let’s hope that turns out to be so.”\n\nICE chief must appear in court to explain why detainees have been denied due process\n\nThe chief federal judge in Minnesota says the Trump administration has failed to comply with orders to hold hearings for detained immigrants. He’s ordered Todd Lyons, Trump’s acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to appear before him Friday to explain why he shouldn’t be held in contempt.\n\n“This Court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result,” Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz wrote in the order dated Monday.\n\nMessages were sent Tuesday to ICE and a DHS spokesperson seeking a response.\n\nICE agents will have a security role at Milan Cortina Olympics\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents will have a security role during the upcoming Milan Cortina Winter Games, according to information shared with local media by sources at the U.S. Embassy in Rome. The Associated Press independently confirmed the information with two sources at the embassy.\n\nThe sources who confirmed ICE participation on Tuesday said that federal ICE agents would support diplomatic security details and would not run any immigration enforcement operations.\n\nDuring previous Olympics, several federal agencies have supported security for U.S. diplomats, including the investigative component of ICE called Homeland Security Investigations, the sources said. They could not be named because they are not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nMilan Mayor Giuseppe Sala said that ICE would not be welcome in his city, which is hosting most ice sports during the Feb. 6-22 Winter Games.\n\n▶ Read more about the ICE agents' planned role in Milan\n\n—- By Trisha Thomas and David Biller\n\nBovino is set to leave Minneapolis as Trump reshuffles the leadership of his immigration crackdown\n\nBorder Patrol commander Gregory Bovino is expected to leave Minneapolis on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the matter, as the Trump administration reshuffles leadership of its immigration enforcement operation and scales back the federal presence after a second fatal shooting by federal officers.\n\nTrump said he was placing his border czar, Tom Homan, in charge of the mission, with Homan reporting directly to the White House, after Bovino drew condemnation for claiming the man who was killed, Alex Pretti, had been planning to “massacre” law enforcement officers, a characterization that authorities had not substantiated.\n\nBovino’s leadership of highly visible federal crackdowns, including operations that sparked mass demonstrations in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and Minneapolis, has drawn fierce criticism from local officials, civil rights advocates and congressional Democrats.\n\nA person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press that Bovino is among the federal agents leaving Minneapolis. The person was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the operation and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.\n\n▶ Read more about Trump's ICE enforcement leadership reshuffle\n\nTrump administration’s trust and credibility tested in wake of Pretti’s death in Minneapolis\n\nTrust is one of a president’s most valuable currencies, especially in a time of crisis. During his second term, Trump has persistently undermined the trust and credibility of major universities, national law firms and media and taken punitive actions against them. His supporters largely either endorsed those actions or stayed mum.\n\nNow the credibility question is aimed at his administration. While the criticism is not directly aimed at the president by his supporters, it is a sign that trust is eroding over some of his most important policies.\n\nThe White House seemed to try to ease the conflict Monday. Trump and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz spoke and both suggested their conversation was productive. Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino, who has been at the center of the administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement surge nationwide, is expected to soon leave Minneapolis.\n\nStill, lawmakers from both parties — including many Republicans — called for independent investigations and, perhaps most importantly, trust after administration officials gave one account of the shooting in Minneapolis, while contemporaneous video provided a decidedly different one.\n\n▶ Read more about how Trump's credibility is increasingly being questioned\n\nTrump will visit Iowa in a bid to focus on affordability during fallout from Minneapolis shooting\n\nTrump is headed to Iowa on Tuesday as part of the White House’s midterm-year pivot toward affordability while his administration remains mired in the fallout in Minneapolis over a second fatal shooting by federal immigration officers this month. Even as some top administration officials moved quickly to malign Alex Pretti, the White House said Monday that Trump was waiting until an investigation into the shooting was complete.\n\nWhile in Iowa, the Republican president will make a stop at a local business and then deliver a speech on affordability, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. The remarks will be at the Horizon Events Center in Clive, a suburb of Des Moines.\n\nThe trip will also highlight energy policy, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said last week. It’s part of the White House’s strategy to have Trump travel out of Washington once a week ahead of the midterm elections to focus on affordability issues facing everyday Americans — an effort that keeps getting diverted by crisis.\n\nMinnesota killing produces backlash against Trump administration from Second Amendment advocates\n\nProminent Republicans and gun rights advocates helped elicit a White House turnabout this week after bristling over the administration’s characterization of Alex Prettibas responsible for his own death because he lawfully possessed a weapon.\n\nThe death produced no clear shifts in U.S. gun politics or policies, even Trump shuffles the lieutenants in charge of his militarized immigration crackdown. But important voices in Trump’s coalition have called for a thorough investigation of Pretti’s death while also criticizing inconsistencies in some Republicans’ Second Amendment stances.\n\nIf the dynamic persists, it could give Republicans problems as Trump heads into a midterm election year with voters already growing skeptical of his overall immigration approach. The concern is acute enough that Trump’s top spokeswoman sought Monday to reassert his brand as a staunch gun rights supporter.\n\n“The president supports the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding American citizens, absolutely,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.\n\nLeavitt qualified that “when you are bearing arms and confronted by law enforcement, you are raising … the risk of force being used against you.”\n\n▶ Read more about the backlash among gun rights advocates",

    "description": "Attorneys for Meta Platforms and other social media companies asked a California federal judge on Monday to block several school districts from taking their",
    "fullText": "Jan 26 (Reuters) - Attorneys for Meta Platforms and other social media companies asked a California federal judge on Monday to block several school districts from taking their lawsuits against the companies to trial, arguing that federal law protects them from claims they ​knowingly addicted young users.\n\nAt a hearing before U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, lawyers for the companies clashed with counsel ‌for six school districts from states across the country, who argue the platforms' design has harmed students' mental health and forced districts to spend money and staff time to address the fallout.\n\nThe companies urged ‌the judge to rule that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which generally shields platforms like Meta's Facebook and Instagram from liability over user-generated content, bars the cases from proceeding to the first trials in federal court over the claims.\n\nJonathan Blavin, an attorney for the social media companies, said the schools’ allegations rely on evidence that includes such content, placing the claims within the protections of Section 230.\n\n\"If that evidence is entirely excluded, I think the record here is incredibly thin,\" Blavin said. \"It's just ⁠not there.\"\n\nLawyers for the school districts countered that their ‌claims are not based on user-content but on platform features they say are intentionally designed to keep young people on the social media sites as long as possible.\n\nAndre Mura, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said their experts had examined broad studies of ‍students who had used social media to support their findings that it had harmed them.\n\n“The literature shows the increase in the risk of harm is not based on content,” he said.\n\nTHOUSANDS OF LAWSUITS IN STATE, FEDERAL COURT\n\nMeta, Snapchat and parent Snap Inc., YouTube and parent Alphabet Inc., and TikTok and parent ByteDance are facing thousands of lawsuits in both federal and ​state court over claims they knowingly designed their platforms to have features that addict children and teens, fueling a mental health crisis.\n\nThe first trial testing ‌the claims in state court is slated for this week in Los Angeles.\n\nThe federal cases have been consolidated into multidistrict litigation before Rogers and include lawsuits brought by families, school districts and state governments.\n\nMonday's hearing focused only on cases filed by school districts, which claim they have been hurt financially from having to manage student mental health issues and social problems like cyberbullying. Rogers is considering whether to enter judgment for the companies in six of those lawsuits, selected as so-called \"bellwether\" or test cases, ahead of the first trials in federal court, currently scheduled to begin in June.\n\nBellwether trials are used to gauge how juries may respond to similar ⁠claims and help establish settlement values for the other similar cases in the litigation.\n\nIn rulings ​on the companies’ motions to dismiss in 2023 and 2024, Rogers said the cases could go ​forward, but Section 230 limited many of their claims, including some about specific features of the platforms.\n\nOn Monday, Rogers agreed that the plaintiffs had a lot of evidence that seemed to be based on content and said that should the cases go forward, there ‍would be a lengthy debate about what ⁠could be shown to the juries.\n\nBut even if the actual content played some role, Rogers said that juries were often asked to examine a problem with several causes and determine which were primarily to blame.\n\n“It’s not like we have a white and a yolk, it’s all scrambled together,” Rogers ⁠said. “That’s a very common circumstance. Why should this be any different?”\n\nThe case is In Re: Social Media Adolescent Addiction/Personal Injury Products Liability Litigation, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District ‌of California, No. 4:22-md-03047.\n\nFor plaintiffs: Andre Mura of Gibbs Mura; Previn Warren of Motley Rice\n\nFor defendants: Jonathan Blavin of Munger Tolles & Olson; ‌Ashley Hardin of Williams & Connolly; Christian Pistilli of Covington & Burling",

    "description": "The president raised a fuss about his ballroom project as a federal judge considers an injunction.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Sunday railed against legal efforts to stop the construction of a massive ballroom on the grounds of the White House.\n\n“There is no practical or reasonable way to go back,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “IT IS TOO LATE!”\n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation last month sued to block the construction of the ballroom after Trump last year demolished the East Wing with little notice to make room for the new building, which will dwarf the main residence.\n\n“The so-called ‘preservationists,’ who get their money from the most unusual of places, should not be allowed to stop this desperately needed addition to our GREAT White House, a place that a President has never needed permission to change or enhance, because of the special grounds on which it sits, no matter how big (and important!), that enhancement may be.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Richard Leon last week questioned the administration’s legal authority on the project and seemed skeptical as he considers a potential injunction. The judge said he would decide next month.\n\nTrump has said the up to $400 million cost of the ballroom will be funded by private donations, raising ethical and other questions that the White House has yet to answer.\n\nBut on Sunday, he defended the planned facility as “a great, big, beautiful gift to the United States of America” and complained that the East Wing had been “bastardized” by previous renovations.\n\nTrump also said that the lawsuit has caused “top secret” information about the project to emerge.\n\nPolitics: U.S. Senator Comes Out And Says It About Trump: 'Invoke The 25th Amendment'\n\n“Additionally, in this instance, it is being done with the design, consent, and approval of the highest levels of the United States Military and Secret Service. The mere bringing of this ridiculous lawsuit has already, unfortunately, exposed this heretofore Top Secret fact. Stoppage of construction, at this late date, when so much has already been ordered and done, would be devastating to the White House, our Country, and all concerned.”\n\nWhile he did not get more specific, the East Wing was known to house the Presidential Emergency Operations Center ― aka the “underground bunker,” which Trump reportedly used during protests in 2020 ― and the new project is likely to replace and/or upgrade the facility.\n\nTrump has been obsessed with the project, which he frequently brings up unprompted. Earlier this month, he even interrupted a White House meeting with oil industry executives to get up, wander over to a window, and stare at the construction site.\n\nTrump on Sunday fired off messages on Truth Social about a number of topics including complaints about the NFL, Canada and journalist Don Lemon. He also wrote some messages about the ongoing unrest in Minneapolis, which has only grown more tense after federal agents shot and killed 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti.\n\nPolitics: National Trust Warns Trump's Ballroom Will 'Overwhelm' White House\n\nBut it was his message about the ballroom that he pinned to the top of his feed.\n\nThe Architect Doing Trump's Ballroom Also Thinks It's Way Too Big: Report\n\n'I Can't Watch': Trump Fires Off Unexpected Whine At The Worst Possible Time\n\nHere's Who Has Been Surprisingly Willing To Defy Trump In His Second Term",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A report by former special counsel Jack Smith on his investigation into President Donald Trump's hoarding of classified documents belongs in the “dustbin of history\" and should remain sealed, the Justice Department said in a sharply worded court filing Friday.\n\n“The illicit product of an unlawful investigation and prosecution belongs in the dustbin of history. The United States will leave it there,” prosecutors wrote.\n\nThe department's position echoes that of Trump, whose lawyers this week asked U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon to permanently block the release of the Smith report. It adds to the likelihood that a detailed report on a criminal investigation once seen as posing significant legal peril to Trump might continue to remain hidden from public view.\n\nSmith and his team produced a two-volume report on investigations into Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Biden and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, after he left the White House following his first term.\n\nBoth investigations produced indictments that were abandoned by Smith's team after Trump's November 2024 election win in light of longstanding Justice Department legal opinions that say sitting presidents cannot face federal prosecution.\n\nThe volume on the election investigation was released in the final days of the Biden administration. But Cannon, a Trump-appointed judge in Florida who issued multiple favorable rulings for Trump and his two co-defendants in the classified documents case, last year granted a defense request to at least temporarily halt the release of the report dealing with that case. That edict meant that Smith could not discuss the substance of that investigation when he testified Thursday before the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe injunction is set to lift on February 24.\n\nBut Jason Reding Quiñones, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, where the case was filed, said in a three-page court filing that the report should remain sealed. He and another prosecutor in that office, Manolo Reboso, wrote that Smith's investigation was “unlawful from its inception.”\n\nThey also wrote that Attorney General Pam Bondi had determined that the report was “an internal deliberative communication that is privileged and confidential and should not be released” outside the Justice Department.\n\n“Smith not only weaponized the Department of Justice against a leading presidential candidate in pursuit of an anti-democratic end, but he did so without legal authority and while targeting constitutionally protected activity,” the prosecutors wrote.\n\nSmith, during his testimony Thursday, defended his investigations of Trump and insisted that he had acted without regard to politics and had no second thoughts about the criminal charges he brought.\n\n“No one should be above the law in our country, and the law required that he be held to account. So that is what I did,” Smith said of Trump.",

    "description": "A federal judge in Georgia on Friday dismissed a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit seeking voter information from the state, ruling the federal government had sued in the wrong city.  U.S.",
    "fullText": "ATLANTA (AP) — A federal judge in Georgia on Friday dismissed a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit seeking voter information from the state, ruling the federal government had sued in the wrong city.\n\nU.S. District Judge Ashley Royal found the government should have sued Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in Atlanta, and not in a separate federal judicial district in Macon, where the secretary of state also has an office.\n\nRoyal dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice, meaning the Justice Department can refile it. The department declined to comment Friday.\n\nThe Justice Department has now filed lawsuits against 24 states and the District of Columbia seeking voter information as part of its effort to collect detailed voting data, including dates of birth and driver’s license and Social Security numbers. A federal judge in California rejected the lawsuit against that state on privacy grounds, while a judge in Oregon has suggested he may dismiss the case there.\n\nThe Trump administration characterizes the lawsuits as an effort to ensure election security, and the Justice Department says the states are violating federal law by refusing to provide voter lists and information.\n\nRaffensperger has been the rare Republican to decline the demand, saying Georgia law prohibits the release of voters' confidential personal unless certain qualifications are met. Raffensperger argues the federal government hasn't met those conditions. He says he shared the public part of the voter roll and information about how Georgia removes ineligible or outdated registrations in December.\n\n“I will always follow the law and follow the Constitution,” Raffensperger said in a statement Friday. “I won't violate the oath I took to stand up for the people of this state, regardless of who or what compels me to do otherwise.”\n\nThe refusal to hand over the records has become an issue in Raffensperger's 2026 run for governor. Raffensperger in January 2021 famously refused a demand from President Donald Trump in a phone call to “find” enough votes to overturn Democrat Joe Biden’s win in Georgia's 2020 presidential election. Many Trump-loving Republicans still hold a grudge against Raffensperger.\n\nThe issue flared just Thursday in a hearing by a state Senate committee where multiple Republican state senators slammed Raffensperger for failing to comply, saying he legally could do so. The committee voted along party lines to advance a resolution calling on Raffensperger to hand over the data and calling it the “latest example of a pattern of behavior by the secretary and his office to refuse oversight of his administration of Georgia’s elections.”\n\nState Sen. Randy Robertson, a Republican from Cataula who filed the resolution, said the dismissal is “frustrating” because even if the Justice Department refiles the lawsuit, the problem will take longer to resolve.\n\n“As public officials we all should participate in any investigation done by a law enforcement agency,” Robertson told The Associated Press Friday.\n\nRobertson is one of many Republican lawmakers backing Lt. Gov. Burt Jones over Raffensperger for the GOP governor nomination. Jones, who already has Trump's endorsement for governor, was one of 16 state Republicans who signed a certificate that Trump had won Georgia and declaring themselves the state’s “duly elected and qualified” electors.",

Authorities have described the case as a coordinated attack and the investigation involved hundreds of hours of work across multiple states.\n\nRaylen Ferguson, 38, of Lexington, Kentucky, is charged with attempted murder, conspiracy to commit murder, aggravated battery and multiple counts of battery with a deadly weapon and intimidation. Prosecutors also filed attempted obstruction of justice charges, along with gang and firearm enhancements.\n\nThomas Moss, 43, of Lafayette, and Blake Smith, 32, also of Lafayette, face similar charges, including attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Both men are additionally charged as habitual offenders. Smith is also charged with assisting a criminal by providing a deadly weapon.\n\nTwo other defendants face charges related to allegedly helping obstruct the investigation. Amanda Milsap, 45, of Lafayette, is charged with bribery and obstruction of justice. Zenada Greer, 61, of Lexington, Kentucky, is charged with assisting a criminal and obstruction of justice.\n\nThe shooting occurred Sunday night when police say Steven Meyer, a judge for Tippecanoe County Superior Court 2, and his wife, Kimberly Meyer, were shot outside their home. Steven Meyer was wounded in the arm and Kimberly Meyer was shot in the hip. Both were treated at a hospital and were listed in stable condition.\n\nPolice said shell casings were recovered at the scene.

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A prominent civil rights attorney and at least two other people involved in an anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a service at a Minnesota church have been arrested, Trump administration officials said Thursday, even as a judge rebuffed related charges against journalist Don Lemon.\n\nVice President JD Vance, speaking in Minneapolis, urged state and local law enforcement to collaborate with federal officials and said protesters must stop getting in their way.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi posted online that Nekima Levy Armstrong had been arrested. On Sunday, protesters entered the Cities Church in St. Paul, where an U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official serves as a pastor. Bondi later posted that a second person had been arrested, and FBI Director Kash Patel announced a third.\n\nThe Justice Department quickly opened a civil rights investigation after the group interrupted services by chanting “ICE out” and “Justice for Renee Good,\" referring to the 37-year-old mother of three who was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis earlier this month.\n\n“Listen loud and clear: WE DO NOT TOLERATE ATTACKS ON PLACES OF WORSHIP,\" the attorney general wrote on X.\n\nCities Church belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention and lists one of its pastors as David Easterwood, who leads an ICE field office. Many Baptist churches have pastors who also work other jobs.\n\nChurch lawyers praise the arrests\n\nProminent leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention have argued that compassion for migrant families cannot justify violating a sacred space during worship.\n\nAttorneys representing the church hailed the arrests.\n\n“The U.S. Department of Justice acted decisively by arresting those who coordinated and carried out the terrible crime,” Doug Wardlow, director of litigation for True North Legal, said in a statement.\n\nThe St. Paul-based nonprofit law firm has taken on religious freedom cases, including filing an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court supporting a Christian counselor who challenged bans on LGBTQ+ “conversion therapy” for kids as a violation of her First Amendment rights.\n\nLevy Armstrong, an attorney and longtime activist, had called for the pastor affiliated with ICE to resign, saying his dual role poses a “fundamental moral conflict.”\n\n“You cannot lead a congregation while directing an agency whose actions have cost lives and inflicted fear in our communities,” she said Tuesday. “When officials protect armed agents, repeatedly refuse meaningful investigation into killings like Renee Good’s, and signal they may pursue peaceful protesters and journalists, that is not justice — it is intimidation.”\n\nVance wants local law enforcement to assist federal officers\n\nState and local elected officials have opposed the crackdown that has become a major focus of Department of Homeland Security sweeps.\n\nVance arrived in the state less than a month after Renee Good was killed. He has called Good’s death a “tragedy of her own making.”\n\nBefore his Minnesota visit, Vance warned the church protesters: “Those people are going to be sent to prison so long as we have the power to do so.\"\n\nLater in Minneapolis, he urged state and city law enforcement to help federal immigration officers.\n\n“We’re doing everything that we can to lower the temperature,” Vance said, adding that he wants “state and local officials to meet us halfway.”\n\nGreg Bovino, a U.S. Border Patrol official, said Minneapolis police failed to help federal agents Wednesday who were surrounded by protesters at a gas station. Minneapolis police responded later that they hadn't received any requests from federal agents for assistance on Wednesday.\n\nLevy Armstrong has helped lead protests after the high-profile police-involved killings of Black Americans, including George Floyd, Philando Castile and Jamar Clark. She is a former president of the NAACP’s Minneapolis branch.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted a photo on X of Levy Armstrong with her arms behind her back next to a person wearing a badge. Noem said she faces a charge under a statute that bars threatening or intimidating someone exercising a right.\n\nPatel posted on X that Chauntyll Louisa Allen, the second person Bondi said was arrested, is charged under a law that prohibits physically obstructing or using the threat of force to intimidate or interfere with a person seeking to participate in a service at a house of worship. Patel said William Kelly has also been arrested.\n\nLevy Armstrong, Kelly and Allen have all been booked about 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of Minneapolis in Sherburne County Jail, where people in federal custody are usually held.\n\nA message seeking comment was sent to Allen's and Kelly's attorney.\n\nSaint Paul Public Schools, where Allen is a board of education member, said it is aware of her arrest but will not comment on pending legal matters.\n\nAllen and Levy Armstrong are part of a community of Black Minnesota activists.\n\nKelly has defended the protest and criticized the church for associating with a pastor who works for ICE.\n\nIn court Thursday, federal magistrate judge Doug Micko granted the women bond and restricted them from traveling outside Minnesota or from going near the church. The government said it would appeal and the women remained in federal custody Thursday afternoon.\n\nLevy Armstrong’s attorney, Jordan Kushner, said he offered for her to turn herself in peacefully, but the Trump administration insisted on arresting her.\n\n“They wanted a spectacle,” Levy Armstrong’s husband, Marques Armstrong, said, recalling around 50 agents came to detain her.\n\nArrests follow a DOJ civil rights investigation\n\nThe Justice Department investigated the church protest swiftly, but found no basis for a civil rights investigation into Good's death.\n\nAdministration officials have said the officer acted in self-defense and that the driver of the Honda was engaging in “an act of domestic terrorism” when she pulled toward him. Past administrations, however, have moved quickly to probe shootings of civilians by law enforcement officials.\n\nThe Justice Department has separately opened an investigation into whether Minnesota officials impeded or obstructed federal immigration enforcement though their public statements. Prosecutors this week sent subpoenas to the offices of Gov. Tim Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her and officials in Ramsey and Hennepin counties, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nJudge rejects charges against Lemon\n\nA magistrate judge rejected federal prosecutors’ bid to charge journalist Don Lemon related to the church protest, said Kushner, Levy Armstrong’s attorney.\n\nLemon has said he was at the church as a journalist and not a protester.\n\n“Once the protest started in the church we did an act of journalism which was report on it and talk to the people involved, including the pastor, members of the church and members of the organization,” Lemon said in a video posted on social media. “That’s it. That’s called journalism.”\n\nLemon's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement that the judge’s action confirms Lemon’s work as a reporter was protected by the First Amendment.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear what the Justice Department would do after the judge’s decision. Authorities could return to a magistrate judge to again seek a criminal complaint or an indictment against Lemon before a grand jury.\n\nCNN, which fired Lemon in 2023, first reported the ruling.\n\nDurkin Richer reported from Washington. Associated Press reporters Chris Megerian in Washington; Corey Williams in Detroit; Jack Dura in Bismarck, North Dakota; and Mike Catalini in Trenton, New Jersey, contributed.",

The ruling from U.S.",
    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled on Thursday that the academics, who are party to a lawsuit alleging U.S. policy singles out noncitizens for detention or deportation over their pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses, can seek relief from the court if their immigration status is changed as retribution for taking part in the case.\n\nThe ruling from U.S. District Judge William Young comes in the wake of trial last year, in which he ruled the Trump administration violated the Constitution when it targeted non-U.S. citizens for deportation solely for supporting Palestinians and criticizing Israel. Young repeatedly chastised the administration for violating the First Amendment rights of the plaintiffs and, on Thursday, issued what he described as “remedial sanction to protect certain of the Plaintiffs’ noncitizen members from any retribution for the free exercise of their constitutional rights.”\n\nDuring the hearing in the case earlier this month, Young maintained that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and their agents had engaged in an “unconstitutional conspiracy” to limit the free speech of the plaintiffs, creating a chilling effect on their rights by their attempts to “pick off certain people.”\n\n“The big problem in this case is that the cabinet secretaries, ostensibly and president of the United States, are not honoring the First Amendment,” said Young, an appointee of the late Republican President Ronald Reagan. “There doesn’t seem to be an understanding of what the First Amendment is by this government.”\n\nIn his ruling, Young said that a noncitizen challenging his or her immigration status change would have to prove that they were a member of the American Association of University Professors and Middle East Studies Association, the two groups that sued, between March 25, 2025, and Sept. 30, 2025. They would also have to show their immigration status had not expired and had not committed any crime after Sept. 30, 2025. The Associated Press is not aware of any members of these groups whose status has changed because they are part of the lawsuit.\n\n“Upon such proof, it shall be presumed that the alteration in immigration status is in retribution for the exercise during the course of the present case of their First Amendment rights,” Young wrote.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment\n\nDuring last year's trial, witnesses for the government acknowledged that the campaign targeted more than 5,000 pro-Palestinian protesters. Other witnesses for the plaintiffs testified to how the campaign stoked fear among academics and prompted some to stop their activism.\n\nAmong the cases that have fueled the lawsuit was that of former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil. Earlier this month, a federal appeals panel reversed a lower court decision that released Khalil from an immigration jail, bringing the government one step closer to detaining and ultimately deporting the Palestinian activist.\n\nThe three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals didn’t decide the key issue in Khalil’s case: whether the Trump administration’s effort to throw Khalil out of the U.S. over his campus activism and criticism of Israel was unconstitutional.\n\nBut in its 2-1 decision, the panel ruled a federal judge in New Jersey didn’t have jurisdiction to decide the matter at this time. Federal law requires the case to fully move through the immigration courts first, before Khalil can challenge the decision, they wrote.\n\nThe decision marked a major win for the Trump administration’s sweeping campaign to detain and deport noncitizens who joined protests against Israel. But it was not immediately clear whether the government would seek to detain Khalil, a legal permanent resident, again while his legal challenges continue.\n\nAnother was the Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was released in May from six weeks of detention after being arrested on a suburban Boston street. She said she was illegally detained following an op-ed piece she co-wrote last year criticizing her school’s response to Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nDuring the latest hearing in the case, Young repeatedly seemed baffled that the country's top leaders would attempt to implement such a policy.\n\n“How could this happen? How could our government’s highest officials seek to so infringe on the rights of people lawfully here in the United States,” he told the court. “The record in this case convinces me that these high officials, and I include the president of the United States, have a fearful view of freedom.”\n\nRamya Krishnan, senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute, which argued for relief in court, said the “administration’s lawless efforts to deport pro-Palestinian advocates has spread terror in our campus communities.”\n\n“Students and scholars shouldn’t have to live in fear that ICE agents could seize them from their homes merely for engaging in political expression,” she said. “Today’s judgment makes emphatically clear that the administration’s campaign of intimidation must end.”",

    "fullText": "BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — In two decades of kicking in doors for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Joseph Bongiovanni often took on the risks of being the “lead breacher,\" meaning he was the first person into the room.\n\nOn Wednesday, he felt a familiar uncertainty awaiting sentencing for using his DEA badge to protect childhood friends who became prolific drug traffickers in Buffalo, New York.\n\n“I never knew what was on the other side of that door — that fear is what I feel today,” Bongiovanni, 61, told a federal judge, pounding the defense table as his face reddened with emotion. “I've always been innocent. I loved that job.”\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Lawrence J. Vilardo sentenced the disgraced lawman to five years in federal prison on a string of corruption counts. The punishment was significantly less than the 15 years prosecutors sought even after a jury acquitted Bongiovanni of the most serious charges he faced, including an allegation he pocketed $250,000 in bribes from the Mafia.\n\nThe judge said the sentence reflected the complexity of the mixed verdicts following two lengthy trials and the almost Jekyll-and-Hyde nature of Bongiovanni's career, in which the lawman racked up enough front-page accolades to fill a trophy case.\n\nBongiovanni once hurtled into a burning apartment building to evacuate residents through billowing smoke. He locked up drug dealers, including the first ever prosecuted in the region for causing a fatal overdose.\n\n“There are two completely polar opposite versions of the facts and polar opposite versions of the defendant,” Vilardo said, assuring prosecutors five years behind bars would pose a considerable hardship to someone who has never been to prison.\n\nDefense attorney Parker MacKay noted the judge had acknowledged Bongiovanni as a “beacon” of the Buffalo community. The government's request for a 15-year sentence, he added, was “completely unmoored to the nature of the convictions.”\n\n“As Mr. Bongiovanni told the judge at sentencing, he is innocent, and we look forward to continuing to work with him to prove that,” MacKay told The Associated Press.\n\nA jury in 2024 convicted Bongiovanni of four counts of obstruction of justice, counts of conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and making false statements to law enforcement.\n\nProsecutors said Bongiovanni's “little dark secret” caused immeasurable damage over 11 years. They likened him to Jose Irizarry, a disgraced former DEA agent serving a 12-year federal sentence after confessing to laundering money for Colombian drug cartels.\n\nBongiovanni upheld an oath not to the DEA, they argued, but to organized crime figures in the tight-knit Italian American community of his North Buffalo upbringing. During sentencing, Bongiovanni’s family dissolved into tears on the front row of the packed courtroom in downtown Buffalo.\n\nProsecutors said Bongiovanni's corruption involved as much inaction as calculated coverup. They pointed to a turning point in 2008 when Bongiovanni could have acted on intelligence about traffickers he knew whose operation would evolve into a large-scale organization with links to California, Vancouver, and New York City.\n\nHe also was accused of authoring bogus DEA reports, stealing sensitive files, throwing off colleagues, outing confidential informants, covering for a sex-trafficking strip club and helping a high school English teacher keep his marijuana-growing side hustle. Prosecutors said he brazenly urged colleagues to spend less time investigating Italians and focus instead on Black and Hispanic people.\n\n“His conduct shook the foundation of law enforcement — and this community — to its core,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Tripi told the judge. “That's what a betrayal is.”\n\nThe ex-agent's downfall came amid a sex-trafficking prosecution that took sensational turns, including an implicated judge who killed himself after the FBI raided his home, law enforcement dragging a pond in search of an overdose victim and dead rats planted outside the home of a government witness who prosecutors allege was later killed by a fatal dose of fentanyl.\n\nIt also involved the Pharoah’s Gentlemen’s Club outside Buffalo. Bongiovanni was childhood friends with the strip club’s owner, Peter Gerace Jr., who authorities say has close ties to both the Buffalo Mafia and the violent Outlaws Motorcycle Club. A separate jury convicted Gerace of a sex trafficking conspiracy and of paying bribes to Bongiovanni.\n\nThe prosecution also cast a harsh light on the DEA after a string of corruption scandals prompted at least 17 agents brought up on federal charges over the past decade. Last month, prosecutors charged another former agent with conspiring to launder millions of dollars and obtain military-grade firearms and explosives for a Mexican drug cartel.\n\nFrank Tarentino, the DEA’s northeast associate chief of operations, said Bongiovanni’s sentence “sends a powerful message that those who betray their badge will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.”",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Yankees managed to hold on to their top-rated prospects in the trade for left-hander Ryan Weathers from the Miami Marlins.\n\nFour of the Yankees' highly regarded farmhands were named to Baseball America's top 100 prospects list for 2026. They are: shortstop George Lombard Jr. (No. 46), right-hander Elmer Rodriguez (No. 59), shortstop Dax Kilby (No. 61), and right-hander Carlos Lagrange (No. 93).\n\nLombard, 20, played 108 games in Double-A last season, hitting eight home runs with a .695 OPS. Kilby, 19, was a first-round draft choice in 2025 and had an .898 OPS and 16 steals in 18 games at Single-A Tampa.\n\nBaseball America named Rodriguez the Yankees' Minor League Pitcher of the Year this past season, leading the farm system with 176 strikeouts. Lagrange can hit over 100 mph with his fastball, making him a possible Major League bullpen option in 2026.\n\nDespite being the most ready of the five players to make an impact in the Majors, outfielder Spencer Jones did not appear on Baseball America's top 100 list.\n\nThere are legitimate concerns with Jones' swing and miss and strikeout rate against MLB arms. He hit 35 home runs between Double-A Somerset and Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre but struck out 179 times in 506 plate appearances.\n\nIf Cody Bellingers signs elsewhere, Jones' chance of making the Yankees' Opening Day roster and splitting left field duties with Jasson Dominguez increases.\n\nMets offer to Kyle Tucker before Dodgers' $240 million deal revealed by former MLB GM\n\nMLB Hot Stove tracker: Live updates on news, rumors, signings and trades for 2025 free agency\n\nKyle Tucker contract details: How much deferred money did Dodgers give new star?\n\nDodgers continue to frustrate all of MLB with major Kyle Tucker signing\n\nRed Sox get big trade update on Brendan Donovan amid updated rumors\n\nFormer Cubs, Twins All-Star utilityman to sign with Rockies on two-year deal",

    "fullText": "As horrific details of the Iranian government’s suppression of protesters emerge — with internal estimates counting more than 10,000 dead — the country’s young, wealthy elite are inciting further rage by continuing to flaunt their lavish lives online as they have for years, as if the nation weren’t on the brink of collapse outside of their privileged bubble.\n\nAmid an enforced internet blackout that allows an oppressive regime to commit “genocide under the cover of digital darkness,” according to one outraged expert, reporters from the Telegraph are said to have observed “rich Iranians” partying at a nightclub in a popular holiday hot spot on the border with Turkey.\n\n“Their lifestyle has enraged the citizens of Iran, specifically Gen Z in their age group, mainly because they see how these rich kids live — with no accountability for anything that they do,” Ella Rosenberg, a senior researcher at the Jerusalem Centre for Foreign Affairs, told the Times of London.\n\nMostly the children of Iran’s ruling class, they’ve famously led hedonistic lifestyles for decades, but their jaw-dropping wealth had become more visible in recent years, due to the government’s temporarily loosened grip on the internet and social media, before the current unrest began.\n\n“They’re the equivalent of the Iranian ‘Gossip Girl’: luxury cars, living in opulent high-rises in north Tehran,” Rosenberg said.\n\nThe wealth of Iran’s young elite first came to global attention more than a decade ago, with the Instagram account @richkidsoftehran.\n\n“It depicts seemingly affluent teens flaunting Rolex watches, Porsches and Maseratis, sprawling estates and pricey attire,” The Post reported in 2014.\n\nThe Instagram account has remained active and now boasts 477,000 followers.\n\nGlamorous snaps ceased being shared on the account in 2024 — since Jan. 9, six new posts relating to current events have appeared, referring to the government as a “regime” — but other well-connected and cashed-up Iranians have become influencers in their own right.\n\nAnashid Hoseini, who is married to the son of Iran’s ambassador to Denmark, has more than 1.7 million followers, thanks to envy-inducing photos that show her dripping with jewels and toting designer handbags.\n\nHoseini is reported to live in Niavaran, an affluent neighborhood in northern Tehran, but she has not posted to her account in almost a month.\n\nIt’s unclear whether she remains in Iran amid the unrest, but many have fled the country in recent weeks seeking shelter in Van, a Turkish province about 60 miles from Iran’s border.\n\nSaid to be a popular holiday spot with affluent Iranians, the Telegraph reported seeing well-heeled types gathering in a venue that can easily cost more than $100 for entry and drinks, according to the outlet.\n\n“These people benefit from the regime. They left Iran for now, because they were worried about staying there. Here, they can feel safe,” one Iranian at the club told the paper.\n\nOther young and well-connected Iranians left their home country long ago, but have still incited anger among those less affluent citizens left behind.\n\nSasha Sobhani, the son of a former Iranian ambassador to Venezuela, became a social media star showing off his expat life in Spain, where he moved in 2019.\n\nSnaps show Sobhani surrounded by scantily clad ladies and luxury sports cars, and he has since denounced Iran.\n\nHowever, the country is seeking his extradition after accusing him of money laundering and running illegal websites.\n\nThe current uprising, which exploded Dec. 28, has morphed into the most serious threat to Iran’s clerical rulers since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nThe regime has answered with overwhelming force, deploying the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its Basij militia to crush the unrest, according to rights groups and witness accounts.\n\nSources inside Iran estimate at least 12,000 — and possibly as many as 20,000 — people may have been killed during the unrest, according to CBS News.\n\nTehran has fiercely disputed the numbers, blaming the bloodshed on what it calls “armed rioters” and “terrorists” backed by foreign powers, including the US and Israel.",

    "fullText": "State provision for psychological health services is lamentable. Until things improve, let’s not judge those who turn to an app for help\n\nIt’s a sunny afternoon in a Roman park and a peculiar, new-to-this-era kind of coming out is happening between me and my friend Clarissa. She has just asked me if I, like her and all of her other friends, use an AI therapist and I say yes.\n\nOur mutual confession feels, at first, quite confusing. As a society, we still don’t know how confidential, or shareable, our AI therapist usage should be. It falls in a limbo between the intimacy of real psychotherapy and the material triviality of sharing skincare advice. That’s because, as much as our talk with a chatbot can be as private as one with a human, we’re still aware that its response is a digital product.\n\nYet it surprised me to hear that Clarissa’s therapist has a name: Sol. I wanted mine to be nameless: perhaps, not giving it a name is consistent with the main psychoanalytical rule – that is, to keep personal disclosure to a minimum, to protect the healing space of the so-called setting.\n\nHowever, it feels very natural to Clarissa for her therapist to have a name, and she adds that all her other friends’ AI therapists have one. “So do all your other friends have AI therapists,” I ask, to which she says: “All of them do.” This startles me even more, as none of my friends in London has one.\n\nI phoned another friend, a psychotherapist in my Sicilian home town of Catania, who a few years ago retired from a role at a provincial health authority and is now working in a private capacity. He confirmed that the use of AI therapists in Italy is widespread and on the rise. He was surprised to hear that I knew of far fewer people in the UK who had opted for this route. I wondered what the contributing factors might be – and I came to the conclusion that they are a mix of culture and economic pressures.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted in 2025 by one of the leading European mental health platforms, 81% of Italians considered mental health issues a form of weakness, yet 57% cited cost as the main reason for not accessing help. In my country, sadly, the words “mental illness” (malattia mentale) still carry the eerie echo of brutal state-run hospitals. The revolutionary 1978 Basaglia law (that still forms the basis of Italian mental health legislation) closed these institutions down, which led to their gradual replacement with community-based services. But the downside of their closure is a system with insufficient resources and a lack of public awareness, perpetuating stigma and difficulties in accessing care. While workplaces should play a crucial part in this destigmatisation by offering proper care, according to the 2025 survey, 42% of workers said that their employer did not offer any mental health provision.\n\nWhile almost half of European countries have currently implemented work-related mental health prevention and promotion programmes, Italy has not. In fact, within the EU, Italy invests the least in mental health. This is alarming, as Italy ranks above the European average when it comes to the prevalence of mental disorders. In fact, it is estimated that 5 million Italians are in need of mental health support but are not able to afford it.\n\nWhen I ask my therapist friend about his experience in the Italian public health system, he told me he used to be the only therapist for a population of more than 200,000 people covering four districts in Sicily. That is why he started offering group therapy sessions. For most of his professional career, he had more than 150 clients at any given time, of which only eight were part of a group. Despite an announcement last year of government plans to expand the range of psychological services, it is unclear how far this will go in benefiting the wider population.\n\n“It feels liberating to be able to tell everything to my AI therapist, knowing it is both a free and a completely unjudging space,” says my friend Giuseppe, from Calabria, in southern Italy. “When I had real therapists, and I tried three, I always entered their office with a crippling anxiety that was the result of two factors combined: the awareness that I was paying more than I could afford and the self-consciousness of doing something that, in my small town, is still perceived as only being for severe cases. Now, I don’t feel the pressure of having to get the maximum out of a session, as it’s free, and I also don’t feel judged, because a therapy app cannot really judge!”\n\nThe more I talk to my friends, the more I’m convinced AI therapy could be a revolution in places such as Italy, where we still lack meaningful strategies to tackle the stigma around mental health conditions. When I ask Giuseppe if his queerness was also a factor in his difficulties in trusting a therapist in his home town, he agrees: “I am not out with my family, and although a therapist would be bound to professional secrecy, I still had trouble trusting someone who lives in a place where homosexuality, just like mental health discussions, is not always met with understanding.”\n\nGiuseppe’s example was comforting: thanks to his AI therapist, he was able to talk about things he had never disclosed to anyone, and get more empathetic responses than any of the real therapists he had tried offered. “I’m 43 and I still live with my parents,” he says, “because my income does not allow otherwise. My AI therapist is always available to me, always calm and supporting, and has helped me immensely in examining my life and all the steps I need to take to change my life for the better.”\n\nOf course, older generations don’t always understand. In a country such as Italy – so tied to traditions – change is not always welcome. And some ethical concerns may be justified: measuring how healthy “relationships” between vulnerable people and their AI therapists really are is not easy.\n\nStill, in a digital age where our feelings are so often commodified for profit, free, clever, never-ending support can be tantalising. And until mental health support becomes more affordable, it may be the best option on the table for many people.\n\nViola di Grado is an Italian author\n\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The shooting spawned waves of protests.\n\nThe Trump administration has sent thousands of immigration agents ​to the Minneapolis area in recent weeks as part ‌of a campaign to ramp up deportations of people in the country without authorization.\n\nTensions over the deployment have mounted considerably since an ICE agent fatally shot Good.\n\nThe court case was brought on behalf of six protesters and observers who claimed their constitutional rights ⁠had been infringed by the actions ​of ICE agents.\n\nThe order explicitly prohibits ​federal officers from detaining people who are peacefully protesting or merely observing the officers, unless there is reasonable ‍suspicion that they ⁠are interfering with law enforcement or have committed a crime.\n\nFederal agents also are banned from using pepper spray, tear ⁠gas or other crowd-control munitions against peaceful demonstrators or bystanders observing and recording ‌the immigration enforcement operations.",

    "description": "A federal judge refused Monday to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week's notice before members of Congress can visit immigration detention facilities.  U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge refused Monday to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week's notice before members of Congress can visit immigration detention facilities.\n\nU.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., concluded that the Department of Homeland Security didn't violate an earlier court order when it reimposed a seven-day notice requirement for congressional oversight visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.\n\nCobb stressed that she wasn't ruling on whether the new policy passes legal muster. Rather, she said, plaintiffs' attorneys representing several Democratic members of Congress used the wrong \"procedural vehicle\" to challenge it. The judge also concluded that the Jan. 8 policy is a new agency action that isn't subject to her prior order in the plaintiffs' favor.\n\nPlaintiffs' lawyers asked Cobb to intervene after three Democratic members of Congress from Minnesota were blocked from visiting an ICE facility near Minneapolis earlier this month — three days after an ICE officer shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis.\n\nLast month, Cobb temporarily blocked an administration oversight visit policy. She ruled Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week’s notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.\n\nA day after Good’s death, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem secretly signed a new memorandum reinstating another seven-day notice requirement. Plaintiffs’ lawyers from the Democracy Forward legal advocacy group said DHS didn't disclose the latest policy until after U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig initially were turned away from an ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building.\n\nOn Monday, Cobb ruled that the new policy is similar but different than the one announced in June 2025.\n\n“The Court emphasizes that it denies Plaintiffs’ motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge Defendants’ January 8, 2026 memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,” she wrote.\n\nDemocracy Forward spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz said they were reviewing the judge's latest order.\n\n“We will continue to use every legal tool available to stop the administration’s efforts to hide from congressional oversight,” she said in a statement.\n\nTwelve other Democratic members of Congress sued in Washington to challenge ICE’s amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities. Their lawsuit accused Republican President Donald Trump’s administration of obstructing congressional oversight of the centers during its nationwide surge in immigration enforcement operations.\n\nA law bars DHS from using appropriated general funds to prevent members of Congress from entering DHS facilities for oversight purposes. Plaintiffs’ attorneys from the Democracy Forward Foundation said the administration hasn’t shown that none of those funds are being used to implement the latest notice policy.\n\n\"Appropriations are not a game. They are a law,\" plaintiffs’ attorney Christine Coogle said during a hearing Wednesday.\n\nJustice Department attorney Amber Richer said the Jan. 8 policy signed by Noem is distinct from the policies that Cobb suspended last month.\n\n“This is really a challenge to a new policy,” Richer said.\n\nPlaintiffs' attorneys said the matter is urgent because members of Congress are negotiating funding for DHS and ICE for the next fiscal year with DHS’s annual appropriations due to expire Jan. 30.\n\n“This is a critical moment for oversight, and members of Congress must be able to conduct oversight at ICE detention facilities, without notice, to obtain urgent and essential information for ongoing funding negotiations,” the lawyers wrote.\n\nGovernment attorneys have said it’s merely speculative for the legislators to be concerned that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week. But the judge rejected those arguments last month.\n\n“The changing conditions within ICE facilities means that it is likely impossible for a Member of Congress to reconstruct the conditions at a facility on the day that they initially sought to enter,” wrote Cobb, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden.",

    "description": "Hundreds of delegates from Vietnam's ruling Communist Party gathered on Monday under tight security for a congress that will select the single-party",
    "fullText": "HANOI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Hundreds of delegates from Vietnam's ruling Communist Party gathered on Monday under tight security for a congress that will select the single-party country's top leader and set economic goals for the remainder of the decade.\n\nThe week-long event, which ​operates under opaque rules and convenes every five years, could cement and possibly expand power for the party's current general secretary, To Lam, who ‌has launched sweeping bureaucratic reforms at home and become Vietnam's public face overseas.\n\nLater in the week, on an unspecified day, about 1,600 delegates will elect a 200-person Central Committee, which will then pick ‌from a pre-arranged shortlist up to 17 to 19 members of the Politburo from which the general secretary is chosen.\n\nLam is seeking to retain his role and possibly take on the state presidency, which has recently been held by a military leader, officials briefed on the matter said. Lam, photographed smiling in state media as he entered the congress venue on Monday, is expected to address delegates on Tuesday.\n\nThe congress is likely to confirm him as general secretary, according to multiple officials, although surprises ⁠cannot be ruled out, while the decision about the presidency ‌is expected to be made at a later meeting where the outcome is even less clear.\n\nAfter the congress, the Politburo will nominate the heads of state, government and Parliament. Parliamentary elections will take place only after leaders are chosen by the ‍party.\n\nLam, 68, has launched several major reforms during his brief tenure as party chief, the country's most powerful job. He ascended to the position following the death of his predecessor, Nguyen Phu Trong, in July 2024.\n\nWidely viewed as a risk-taker, Lam introduced the most significant administrative reform in decades when he cut tens of thousands of jobs in an ​effort to speed up decisions. The impact has yet to be fully assessed as officials adapt, but approval timelines for some investment projects have shortened.\n\nThat ‌acceleration is tied in part to the scaling back of a sweeping anti‑corruption drive launched under Trong, an effort that Lam helped lead as public security minister. The campaign, which was meant to combat systemic bribery, at times paralysed government decision‑making and led to the downfall of senior figures - including two presidents - clearing Lam's path to the top.\n\nLam has also launched economic reforms and a burst of infrastructure projects, winning favour with foreign investors while stoking concerns about favouritism and waste.\n\nIn a country that allows no opposition, Lam has presided over a strengthening of the security forces and a tightening of controls over media and other critical ⁠voices.\n\nECONOMIC GROWTH, SECURITY TOP NEXT FIVE-YEAR AGENDA\n\nThe congress' delegates represent 5.6 million party members in ​a country of 100 million.\n\nUnder tight security - mobile phones will be jammed in the Hanoi building ​where the congress will take place and delegates, including those from Hanoi, are required to stay in designated accommodation - they will also refine the text of a resolution to be approved by the end of the congress, which is scheduled to wrap up ‍on January 25.\n\nA party draft released in ⁠October on the party's website suggests the final text will prioritise security and ambitious growth, targeting at least 10% annually over the next five years, from the 6.5% to 7.0% target that was missed in the first half of the decade.\n\nThe draft mentions security dozens of times and highlights ⁠the importance of diplomacy and defence in a \"more dangerous\" world. The party intends to increase its defence forces, especially in border areas, the draft text says.\n\nEnvironmental protection, which has been increasingly ‌debated recently in the heavily polluted country, has also gained prominence, according to Politburo member Nguyen Xuan Thang.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Manhattan's top federal prosecutor said Friday that a judge lacks the authority to appoint a neutral expert to oversee the public release of documents in the sex trafficking probe of financier Jeffrey Epstein and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nJudge Paul A. Engelmayer was told in a letter signed by U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton that he must reject a request this week by the congressional cosponsors of the Epstein Files Transparency Act to appoint a neutral expert.\n\nU.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, and Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, say they have “urgent and grave concerns” about the slow release of only a small number of millions of documents that began last month.\n\nIn a filing to the judge they said they believed “criminal violations have taken place” in the release process.\n\nClayton, though, said Khanna and Massie do not have standing with the court that would allow them to seek the “extraordinary” relief of the appointment of a special master and independent monitor.\n\nEngelmayer “lacks the authority” to grant such a request, he said, particularly because the congressional representatives who made the request are not parties to the criminal case that led to Maxwell's December 2021 sex trafficking conviction and subsequent 20-year prison sentence for recruiting girls and women for Epstein to abuse and aiding the abuse.\n\nKhanna said Clayton's response “misconstrued” the intent of their request.\n\n“We are informing the Court of serious misconduct by the Department of Justice that requires a remedy, one we believe this Court has the authority to provide, and which victims themselves have requested,” Khanna said in a statement.\n\n“Our purpose is to ensure that DOJ complies with its representations to the Court and with its legal obligations under our law,” he added.\n\nEpstein died in a federal jail in New York City in August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. The death was ruled a suicide.\n\nThe Justice Department expects to update the court “again shortly” regarding its progress in turning over documents from the Epstein and Maxwell investigative files, Clayton said in the letter.\n\nThe Justice Department has said the files’ release was slowed by redactions required to protect the identities of abuse victims.\n\nIn their letter, Khanna and Massie wrote that the Department of Justice’s release of only 12,000 documents out of more than 2 million documents being reviewed was a “flagrant violation” of the law’s release requirements and had caused “ serious trauma to survivors.”\n\n“Put simply, the DOJ cannot be trusted with making mandatory disclosures under the Act,” the congressmen said as they asked for the appointment of an independent monitor to ensure all documents and electronically stored information are immediately made public.\n\nThey also recommended that a court-appointed monitor be given authority to prepare reports about the true nature and extent of the document production and whether improper redactions or conduct have taken place.",

    "fullText": "The New York Yankees are entering the final phase of Aaron Judge’s prime, but their front office isn’t acting like it this offseason.\n\nNew York’s ongoing talks with Cody Bellinger (who might land elsewhere) are happening within the context of a painfully underwhelming offseason for Yankees fans.\n\nFirst, the Yankees were blindsided by Trent Grisham accepting his qualifying offer. Their acquisitions and retentions since then have been marginal at best: Amed Rosario, Ryan Yarbrough, Paul Blackburn, and Ryan Weathers.\n\nWhile the Baltimore Orioles have been killing it this offseason, and with the Toronto Blue Jays making some big moves as well, the Yankees look ridiculous with how inactive they’ve been. The Boston Red Sox were more or less quiet for awhile, but even their offseason has been miles better than New York’s, especially now that they’ve added Ranger Suárez.\n\nBleacher Report’s Zachary D. Rymer recently wrote an article talking about the MLB teams who have had the worst offseason, and the Yankees were at the top of his list.\n\n“(The Yankees) seem to be treating their offseason shopping as an optional exercise,” Rymer wrote on Wednesday. “Even bringing back Cody Bellinger, which should be a lay-up, is proving difficult.\n\n… These are the Yankees we’re talking about. No move is supposed to be too big, so no fan should be forgiving of how they’ve made only small moves so far.”\n\n“The Yankees actually project as the fourth-best team in MLB this year, but those projections are taking a lot on faith with question marks like Anthony Volpe, Austin Wells and even Giancarlo Stanton,” Rymer continued. “In other words, the last thing the Yankees should be thinking is that they can leave good enough alone.”\n\nTwo AL East Teams Reportedly Still In On Framber Valdez",

    "fullText": "A federal judge in Minnesota on Thursday ordered the release of a Liberian man four days after heavily armed immigration agents broke into his home using a battering ram and arrested him.\n\nU.S. District Judge Jeffrey Bryan said in his ruling that the agents violated Garrison Gibson’s Fourth Amendment rights against unlawful search and seizure.\n\n“To arrest him, Respondents forcibly entered Garrison G.’s home without his consent and without a judicial warrant,” he said.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has been ramping up immigration arrests in Minnesota in what the department has called its largest enforcement operation. DHS says its officers have arrested more than 2,500 people since Nov. 29.\n\nMarc Prokosch, Gibson’s attorney, said he was “thrilled” by the judge's order. He had filed a habeas corpus petition, used by courts to determine if an imprisonment is legal, and called the arrest a “blatant constitutional violation\" since the agents did not have a proper warrant.\n\nGibson’s wife was inside their Minneapolis home with the couple’s 9-year-old child during the raid. Prokosch said she was deeply shaken by the arrest.\n\nGibson, 37, was being held at an immigration detention center in Albert Lea after being held at a large camp on the Fort Bliss Army base in El Paso, Texas, according to ICE’s detainee locator.\n\nDHS did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press requesting comment on the order and has not responded to a prior email with follow-up questions about Gibson’s case.\n\nGibson, who fled the Liberian civil war as a child, had been ordered removed from the U.S., apparently because of a 2008 drug conviction that was later dismissed by the courts. He had remained in the country legally under what’s known as an order of supervision, with the requirement that he meet regularly with immigration authorities.\n\nOnly days before his arrest, Gibson had checked in with immigration authorities at regional immigration offices — the same building where agents have been staging enforcement raids in recent weeks.\n\nBryan said in his Thursday order that he agrees with Gibson's assertions that since he had already been released on an order of supervision, officials “violated applicable regulations” by not giving him enough notice that it had been revoked and the reasoning, as well as not providing him an interview right after he was detained.\n\nTricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Homeland Security Department, had said that Gibson has “a lengthy rap sheet (that) includes robbery, drug possession with intent to sell, possession of a deadly weapon, malicious destruction and theft.” She did not indicate if those were arrests, charges or convictions.\n\nCourt records indicate Gibson’s legal history shows only the one felony in 2008, along with a few traffic violations, minor drug arrests and an arrest for riding public transportation without paying the fare.\n\nThe Twin Cities — the latest target in President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement campaign — has been wracked by fear and anger in the aftermath of the killing of Renee Good, who was shot Jan. 7 during a confrontation with agents. On Wednesday, a man was shot and wounded by an immigration officer who had been attacked with a shovel and broom handle.",

    "fullText": "SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) — A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit against California that sought detailed voting records and personal data on its 23 million registered voters, concluding that the government's request was “unprecedented and illegal.”\n\nThe Trump administration's lawsuit, filed last year, contended that California and other states were illegally blocking the federal government's wide-ranging effort to scrutinize detailed voter data that states said was private and protected.\n\nThe administration “may not unilaterally usurp the authority over elections” U.S. District Judge David O. Carter in Santa Ana said in his 33-page decision.\n\nFurthermore, the attempt to gather and centralize the personal information would have a chilling effect on voter registration and threaten “the right to vote which is the cornerstone of American democracy,” the judge ruled.\n\n“There cannot be unbridled consolidation of all elections power in the executive (branch) without action from Congress,” Carter said. “This is antithetical to the promise of fair and free elections.”\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nIt has accused states of failing to respond sufficiently to questions about the procedures they take to maintain voter rolls. The department has sued 23 states, most of them controlled by Democrats, and the District of Columbia for detailed voter data that includes names, dates of birth, residential addresses, driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers.\n\nState election officials have questioned what the DOJ plans to do with that information. Last fall 10 Democratic secretaries of state wrote Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to express concern over reports that the DOJ was sharing state voter data with the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of DHS, operates a program that checks citizenship status.\n\nCalifornia Secretary of State Shirley Weber, the state's chief elections officer, said in a statement that California would “continue to challenge this administration’s disregard for the rule of law and our right to vote.”",

    "description": "Huge protests in Iran have galvanised exiled foes of the authorities but despite their hatred of the ruling clerics, a bitter schism dating to before the 1979",
    "fullText": "PARIS, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Huge protests in Iran have galvanised exiled foes of the authorities but despite their hatred of the ruling clerics, a bitter schism dating to before the 1979 Islamic Revolution still afflicts the leading opposition factions.\n\nThat split, between monarchists supporting Reza Pahlavi, son of the ousted shah, and a more organised leftist group, the Mujahedin-e Khalq, has played out online ​and even in angry arguments in street protests in Europe and North America.\n\nHow far either faction has support inside Iran, or might be able to shape events there in the future, is hard to gauge, ‌though analysts and diplomats have for decades regarded both as being far more popular among emigres than inside the country.\n\nMany other Iranians outside Iran are also deeply sceptical of both the monarchists and MEK, but have no organised opposition network comparable to those factions.\n\nThe lack of a universally ‌accepted opposition movement or figurehead has complicated international approaches towards the deadly unrest sweeping Iran, with U.S. President Donald Trump questioning Pahlavi's support even as he weighed air strikes.\n\n\"What's problematic is there has been no inclusive organisation that has been built that can bring together Iranians of all walks of life: religious, ethnic, socioeconomic,\" said Sanam Vakil, Middle East head at the Chatham House think tank in London.\n\nDuring the past two weeks of violent unrest, videos in Iranian cities have shown some demonstrators chanting in support of the ousted monarchy and the late shah's son, who has encouraged the protests.\n\nShah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled into exile in 1979 and died a year later, was a close Western ally who harked back to ⁠ancient Persian heritage in framing his rule as a national leader and moderniser. But ‌he resisted democratic change as increasing economic disparities destabilised the country.\n\nHis 65-year-old son, who is based in the U.S., says he wants democracy for Iran and has not specified any role he would seek if the current system collapsed. His supporters run one of the main Persian-language satellite television stations broadcasting into Iran.\n\nReza Pahlavi's supporters in the West have pointed to ‍the videos of protesters in Iran chanting his name as evidence his popularity is growing, saying he is the only figure able to unite the country if the Islamic Republic implodes.\n\nAmong foreign officials and diplomats following Iran there are mixed views as to whether the latest protests show that Pahlavi's role is growing.\n\nA Western diplomat said Pahlavi's name may have been used by street protesters because there were few other recognisable opposition figures, but that there was no sign he commanded the sort of domestic support that could make ​him a future leader.\n\nA European official said a big spike in protest numbers after a call for street action by foreign opponents of the government, including Pahlavi, showed his stature may be broader than was previously understood.\n\nHowever, ‌any role he played would need to be in the context of a wider democratic movement, said Iranian analyst and former diplomat Mehrdad Khonsari. \"You need a coalition of people who believe in democratic values in order to sort of lighten the weight and give greater confidence to people,\" he said.\n\nThe idea that Pahlavi may have popularity inside Iran is not shared by the MEK, whose supporters regard the pre-revolution monarchy as comparable to the current Shi'ite theocracy.\n\nIts supporters online often use the slogan \"No Monarchy, No Supreme Leader\".\n\nThe MEK is a movement fusing leftist and Islamist ideas whose cadres carried out bombings inside Iran before and after the revolution, even as mass support was growing for rival factions on the streets.\n\nThe ruling clerics banished the MEK in 1981 and it established military bases in Iraq that it used to launch attacks on Iranian troops during the 1980s Iran-Iraq war, something many Iranians remember with fury.\n\nIt was listed as a terrorist ⁠organisation in the United States until 2012, but some Western politicians have voiced backing for the group including former U.S. secretary of ​state Mike Pompeo.\n\nHowever, the European official described the MEK as widely despised inside Iran, partly because of its conduct during the Iran-Iraq war, ​and analysts say it has had little presence in the country for decades.\n\nThe group's official leader Massoud Rajavi has not been seen since 2002 and is widely thought to be dead, though the MEK has not acknowledged that. His wife, Maryam Rajavi, runs the organisation and its affiliate, the National Council for Resistance in Iran.\n\nGroup officials say their supporters are widespread in Iran and ‍active, though there has been no public sign of support ⁠for the MEK seen by Reuters during the protests.\n\nMonarchists - along with many other Iranian dissidents and Iran's current rulers - regard the MEK with intense suspicion, pointing to its history of violence and enforcement of ideological purity within its ranks.\n\nFor many Iranians, the arguments between the Islamic Republic's theocratic establishment, monarchists voicing nostalgia for the 1970s, and a revolutionary group that lost out in the early 1980s may seem outdated.\n\nEven as monarchist and ⁠MEK supporters remained prominent among émigrés and as the same faces revolved through the upper echelons of the Islamic Republic, Iran's population was doubling in size and growing more urban and educated.\n\nMost major political movements inside Iran after 1979 sought to either bolster or reform the Islamic ‌Republic, rather than sweep it away entirely, until successive waves of protest in recent years demanding more comprehensive change.\n\n\"Iranians inside Iran are, I think, not just looking to the diaspora for their future,\" ‌said Vakil.",

    "description": "Paramount suffered a legal setback in its fight for Warner Bros. Discovery, as a judge ruled Paramount \"was not misled by any omissions\" from WBD.",
    "fullText": "David Ellison's Paramount Skydance just suffered another setback, this time in its legal fight with Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nA Delaware judge ruled against Paramount, which had sued WBD in hopes of getting a court order forcing its acquisition target to quickly release information about how the company valued its cable networks.\n\nThe value of WBD's cable TV networks is a key difference between Paramount's and Netflix's rival bids. Paramount wants to buy them while Netflix does not.\n\nParamount's effort was unsuccessful, as the Delaware Court of Chancery's Morgan Zurn ruled against Paramount's motion for a summary judgment seeking expedited discovery on Thursday morning.\n\n\"Paramount has not shown it will suffer cognizable irreparable harm if expedition is not granted,\" Zurn said in her ruling.\n\nA Paramount spokesperson said in a statement that the company \"continues to urge WBD to make these disclosures so that WBD shareholders can make an informed decision.\"\n\nWBD said in a statement that the company was pleased the court \"rejected the notion that this lawsuit needed special treatment and may have other serious flaws.\"\n\nParamount has made eight offers to buy WBD, which have been rejected by WBD's board of directors in favor of its Netflix deal. However, Paramount still thinks its all-cash, $30-per-share offer for all of WBD, including its cable networks like CNN, is superior to Netflix's cash-and-stock bid of $27.75 per share for WBD's studio and HBO assets.\n\nSince Netflix does not want to buy WBD's cable TV networks, their value could determine whether WBD shareholders choose Paramount's rival, hostile bid. Paramount hoped the court would require WBD to disclose how it valued its cable channels.\n\n\"For stockholders to understand the difference between those two transactions, they need certain basic information that they don't have today,\" Quinn Emanuel lawyer Mike Barlow said on behalf of Paramount. Barlow argued WBD's shareholders \"are being harmed\" every day that they don't have WBD's valuation of its TV networks.\n\nWBD's legal team — led by Ryan McLeod from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz — said there was \"zero emergency\" to disclose WBD's valuation of its cable assets and \"no threat\" of clear, irreparable harm to Paramount that required it to immediately release that information.\n\nMcLeod, from WBD's team, argued that there wasn't a rush for WBD to disclose how it valued its cable networks, saying that Paramount's January 21 deadline for WBD shareholders to give Paramount control of their shares was an arbitrary date that could easily be moved.\n\nTo that point, Paramount's Barlow said that the company \"fully intends to extend this tender offer,\" which would give WBD shareholders more time to decide whether to tender their shares.\n\nJudge Zurn ruled in WBD's favor, reasoning that \"Paramount as a stockholder was not misled by any omissions\" from WBD, since Ellison's company wasn't deciding whether to take its own offer.",

    "fullText": "PHOENIX (AP) — Mark Brnovich, Arizona's top law enforcement officer when the state became the epicenter of efforts by President Donald Trump and his allies to find proof that the 2020 election was marred by fraud, has died. He was 59.\n\nBrnovich died after having a heart attack Monday, Katie Conner, a representative of the family, said Tuesday.\n\nColleagues and friends of Brnovich praised him for his work in public service that included stints as a judge, a prosecutor, lawyer and the director of the Arizona Department of Gaming. Former Republican Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said Brnovich's passion for the law, justice and victims were hallmarks of his career.\n\n“For those of us blessed to call him a friend, his humor, positivity, and happy warrior spirit were infectious. May he rest in peace,” Ducey said on the social platform X.\n\nBrnovich, a Republican, was in his second term as attorney general in Arizona when his office investigated the 2020 election. Arizona was among the states Joe Biden won that year to deny Trump reelection to the presidency.\n\nBrnovich released an interim report in April 2022 that outlined his concerns with some election procedures but did not provide any proof of major issues despite six months of investigation.\n\nAt the time, Brnovich was seeking the Republican nomination for a U.S. Senate seat and facing fierce criticism from Trump, who claimed he wasn’t doing enough to prosecute election fraud. Brnovich wanted an endorsement from Trump but didn't get it.\n\nWhen current Attorney General Kris Mayes took office, she revealed that Brnovich suppressed findings from his investigators. Mayes said the records showed the 2020 election “was conducted fairly and accurately by election officials.”\n\nThe documents she released also showed Brnovich withheld a separate memo that systematically refuted election conspiracies that took root on the right, including allegations of dead or duplicate voters, pre-marked ballots flown in from Asia, election servers connected to the internet and even manipulation by satellites controlled by the Italian military.\n\nMayes posted on X that she was saddened to hear of Brnovich's sudden passing and said he dedicated many years to public service. She offered condolences to his wife Susan and their family.\n\nBrnovich lost the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate in 2021. In a video launching his campaign, Brnovich described himself as the son of immigrants who fled communism in Yugoslavia. He said he used his post as attorney general to take on “crony capitalists” and government overreach, while promoting religious liberty, border security and election integrity.\n\nIn April, Trump nominated Brnovich to be ambassador to Serbia but withdrew his nomination in October.",

    "fullText": "The showdown between Elon Musk and Sam Altman is headed to court — and it's set to be a long one.\n\nOakland federal judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers on Tuesday set a new trial date for Musk's legal dispute with OpenAI — one week after saying the Tesla CEO had enough evidence for the case to be decided by a jury.\n\nJury selection is now scheduled to start on Monday, April 27. The trial will start the next day and could last four weeks, through May 22, the court docket showed. The trial had previously been scheduled for March 30.\n\nIt's the latest development in a clash of the tech titans that kicked off last year when Musk sued Altman over the ChatGPT maker's partnership with Microsoft and shift toward a for-profit model. Musk, a founder and early supporter of OpenAI, claims he contributed $38 million to OpenAI over the years under the premise that it would maintain its original altruistic, nonprofit roots.\n\nOpenAI has countered that Musk knew about its pivot toward a for-profit as early as 2018 and says its nonprofit arm still plays a central role in its governance. The company has blasted the lawsuit as baseless and has characterized it as part of a larger harassment campaign by Musk.\n\nLast week, Judge Gonzalez Rogers rejected arguments by Altman's lawyers to block the case from proceeding to trial, saying Musk had sufficient evidence to justify a jury trial.\n\n\"I think there's plenty of evidence,\" the judge said at a hearing on January 7. \"It's circumstantial, but that's how these things work.\"\n\nHundreds of exhibits were unsealed in the case last week, including a 2023 text that revealed tension in the two tech titans' relationship before Musk filed his suit.\n\n\"I don't think openai would have happened without you — and it really fucking hurts when you publicly attack openai,\" Altman texted Musk in 2023.\n\nMusk responded: \"I hear you and it is certainly not my intention to be hurtful, for which I apologize, but the fate of civilization is at stake.\"",

A federal jury convicted Wei in August of six crimes, including espionage. He was paid more than $12,000 for the information he sold, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement.\n\nWei, an engineer for the amphibious assault ship USS Essex, was one of two California-based sailors charged on Aug. 3, 2023, with providing sensitive military information to China. The other, Wenheng Zhao, was sentenced to more than two years in 2024 after he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and one count of receiving a bribe in violation of his official duties.\n\nU.S. officials have for years expressed concern about the espionage threat they say the Chinese government poses, bringing criminal cases in recent years against Beijing intelligence operatives who have stolen sensitive government and commercial information, including through illegal hacking.\n\nWei was recruited via social media in 2022 by an intelligence officer who portrayed himself as a naval enthusiast working for the state-owned China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, prosecutors said.\n\nEvidence presented in court showed Wei told a friend that the person was “extremely suspicious” and that it was “quite obviously” espionage. Wei disregarded the friend's advice to delete the contact and instead moved conversations with the intelligence officer to a different encrypted messaging app Wei believed was more secure, prosecutors said.\n\nOver the course of 18 months, Wei sent the officer photos and videos of the Essex, advised him of the location of various Navy ships and told him about the Essex's defensive weapons, prosecutors said.\n\nWei sold the intelligence officer 60 technical and operating manuals, including those for weapons control, aircraft and deck elevators. The manuals contained export control warnings and detailed the operations of multiple systems aboard the Essex and similar ships.\n\nHe was a petty officer second class, which is a enlisted sailor's rank.\n\nThe Navy's website says the Essex is equipped to transport and support a Marine Corps landing force of over 2,000 troops during an air and amphibious assault.\n\nIn a letter to the judge before sentencing, Wei apologized and said he shouldn’t have shared anything with the person who he had considered a friend. Wei said “introversion and loneliness” clouded his judgment.",

Three energy developers are challenging the administration’s freeze of their offshore wind projects in the federal courts this week.\n\nDanish energy company Orsted, Norwegian company Equinor, and Dominion Energy Virginia each sued to ask the courts to vacate and set aside the administration’s Dec. 22 order to freeze five big projects on the East Coast over national security concerns. Orsted’s hearing was first on its Revolution Wind project. Orsted said it will soon resume construction to deliver affordable, reliable power to the Northeast.\n\nThe administration did not reveal specifics about its national security concerns, but Trump said Friday while meeting with oil industry executives about investing in Venezuela that wind farms are “losers.” He said they lose money, destroy the landscape and kill birds.\n\n“I’ve told my people we will not approve windmills,” Trump said. “Maybe we get forced to do something because some stupid person in the Biden administration agreed to do something years ago. We will not approve any windmills in this country.”\n\nThe Biden administration sought to ramp up offshore wind as a climate change solution. Trump began reversing the country’s energy policies his first day in office with a spate of executive orders aimed at boosting oil, gas and coal. A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nThe Trump administration paused leases for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind. New York’s attorney general sued the Trump administration on Friday over Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind.\n\nRevolution Wind and Sunrise Wind are both major offshore wind projects by Orsted. Rhode Island and Connecticut filed their own request in court to try to save Revolution Wind.\n\n“The law takes precedent over the political whims of one man, and we will continue to fight to make sure that remains the case,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.\n\nAt Monday's hearing, attorney Janice Schneider, representing Revolution Wind, said the stop work order came at a critical stage of construction, with the project nearly 90% built and weeks away from beginning to deliver power to the electric grid. She said the delay is costing more than $1.4 million per day, and a specialized vessel has just enough time now to install the remaining turbines before its contract is up at the site in February.\n\nSchneider said they take national security issues seriously, but the government has not shared more information about its concerns with their experts who have security clearances, or shared unclassified summaries.\n\n“We do think that this court should be very skeptical of the government’s true motives here,\" Schneider said, citing Trump's comments from Friday.\n\nDepartment of Justice attorney Peter Torstensen argued that national security is paramount and protecting against new risks identified in the classified materials outweighs any alleged irreparable harm to the developers.\n\nWork on the Revolution Wind project was previously paused on Aug. 22 for what the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said were national security concerns. A month later, Judge Lamberth ruled the project could resume, citing the irreparable harm to the developers and the demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits of their claim. Orsted is building it with Skyborn Renewables.\n\nWith four offshore wind projects still stalled, Hillary Bright, executive director of offshore wind advocacy group Turn Forward, said she's hopeful that they will prevail in court and that the administration will begin to understand \"the immense benefits that these nearly complete power sources can bring to our nation’s energy and national security.”\n\nEquinor owns Empire Wind. Its limited liability company, Empire Wind LLC, said the project faces “likely termination” if construction can’t resume by this Friday because the order disrupts a tightly choreographed construction schedule dependent on vessels with very limited availability. Its hearing is Wednesday.\n\n“I would like to think that offshore wind is, and will continue to be, part of an all-of-the-above energy solution, which our country desperately needs,” said Molly Morris, Equinor’s senior vice president overseeing Empire Wind.\n\nDominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, was the first to sue. It’s asking a judge to block the order, calling it “arbitrary and capricious” and unconstitutional. Its hearing is Friday.\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations. AP is solely responsible for all content.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nThe grants supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, including battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and efforts to capture carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nThe Energy Department said the projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Russell Vought, the White House budget director, said on social media that “the Left’s climate agenda is being canceled.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said the administration’s action violated the Constitution’s equal protection requirements.\n\n“Defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024,” Mehta wrote in a 17-page opinion. The administration offered no explanation for how their purposeful targeting of grant recipients based on their electoral support for Trump — or lack of it — “rationally advances their stated government interest,” the judge added.\n\nThe ruling was the second legal setback for the administration’s rollback of clean energy program in a matter of hours. A separate federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as Trump seeks to shut it down.\n\nA spokesman for the Energy Department said officials disagree with the judge’s decision on clean energy grants.\n\nOfficials “stand by our review process, which evaluated these awards individually and determined they did not meet the standards necessary to justify the continued spending of taxpayer dollars,” spokesman Ben Dietderich said. “The American people deserve a government that is accountable and responsible in managing taxpayer funds.”\n\nProjects were canceled in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state. All 16 targeted states supported Harris.\n\nThe cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.\n\nThe city of St. Paul and a coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit after they lost grants.\n\nTrump said in an interview last fall with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects that Democrats want. “I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said in the Oct. 1 interview.\n\nVickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, one of the groups that filed the suit, said the court ruling “recognized that the Trump Department of Energy vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration, in violation of the bedrock Constitutional guarantee that all people in all states have equal protection under the law.”\n\nThe administration’s actions violated the Constitution, foundational American values and “imposed high costs on the American people who rely on clean affordable energy for their pocketbooks and for healthier lives,” Patton said.\n\nAnne Evens, CEO of Elevate Energy, one of the groups that lost funding, said the court ruling would help keep clean energy affordable and create jobs.\n\n“Affordable energy should be a reality for everyone, and the restoration of these grants is an important step toward making that possible,” she said.",

    "fullText": "Jan 12 (Reuters) - A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from terminating nearly $12 million in grant funding awarded to the American Academy of Pediatrics that was canceled ​after the medical group clashed with U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over changes ‌to vaccine policy.\n\nU.S. District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington, D.C., issued a preliminary injunction late on Sunday after finding the medical group ‌was likely to prevail on its claim that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services retaliated against it because of its advocacy in violation of its free speech rights under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.\n\nShe said \"pejorative\" statements HHS officials had made attacking AAP because of its support of childhood vaccinations and gender-affirming care indicated they ⁠had \"clear animus\" toward the group when ‌its grants were terminated.\n\n\"When force and coercion replace reason in the marketplace of ideas, the public suffers by denial of access to high-quality information,\" wrote Howell, who was ‍appointed by Democratic former President Barack Obama.\n\nAAP and HHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.\n\nHowell's ruling came after a judge in Boston last week cleared the way for AAP and other medical groups to move forward ​with a separate, earlier lawsuit they brought challenging HHS policies adopted under Kennedy that they say will ‌reduce U.S. vaccination rates.\n\nAAP said the seven grants were abruptly canceled on December 16, a day before the Boston judge heard arguments in that case, as part of an effort to discredit the group after it emerged as a vocal critic of major changes to federal vaccine policy under Kennedy, who founded the anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense before becoming the head of HHS.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ⁠and the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration administered the ​grants, which supported initiatives to reduce sudden infant death and improve care ​in rural communities, among other things.\n\nAAP broke with federal policy in August when it recommended that all young children get vaccinated against COVID-19, diverging from the U.S. Centers for ‍Disease Control and Prevention under ⁠Kennedy, which in May said healthy children can take the shots if parents and doctors agree they are needed.\n\nThe group sharply criticized a separate move by the CDC on January 5 to ⁠cut the number of vaccines it recommends every child receive as \"dangerous and unnecessary,\" and AAP continues to support gender-affirming care for ‌transgender youth, which the Trump administration has sought to restrict.",

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge said Friday that she expects to temporarily block efforts by the Trump administration to end a program that offered temporary legal protections for more than 10,000 family members of citizens and green card holders.\n\nU.S. District Judge Indira Talwani said at a hearing that she planned to issue a temporary restraining order but did not say when it would be issued. This case is part of a broader effort by the administration to end temporary legal protection for numerous groups and comes just over a week since another judge ruled that hundreds of people from South Sudan may live and work in the United States legally.\n\n“The government, having invited people to apply, is now laying traps between those people and getting the green card,” Justin Cox, an attorney who works with Justice Action Center and who argued the case for the plaintiffs, said. “That is incredibly inequitable.”\n\nThis case involved a program called Family Reunification Parole, or FRP, and impacts people from Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti and Honduras. Most of them are set to lose their legal protections, which were put in place during the Biden administration, by Jan. 14. The Department of Homeland Security terminated protections late last year.\n\nThe case involves five plaintiffs but lawyers are seeking to have any ruling cover everyone that is part of the program.\n\n“Although in a temporary status, these parolees did not come temporarily; they came to get a jump-start on their new lives in the United States, typically bringing immediate family members with them,” plaintiffs wrote in their motion. “Since they arrived, FRP parolees have gotten employment authorization documents, jobs, and enrolled their kids in school.”\n\nThe government, in its brief and in court, argued Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has the authority to terminate any parole program and gave adequate notice by publishing the termination in the federal registry. It also argued that the program's termination was necessary on national security grounds because the people had not been property vetted. It also said resources to maintain this program would be better used in other immigration programs.\n\n“Parole can be terminated at any time,” Katie Rose Talley, a lawyer for the government told the court. \"That is what is being done. There is nothing unlawful about that.\"\n\nTalwani conceded that the government can end the program but she took issue with the way it was done.\n\nThe government argued that just announcing in the federal registry that it was ending the program was sufficient. But Talwani demanded the government show how it has alerted people through a written notice — a letter or email — that the program was ending.\n\n“I understand why plaintiffs feel like they came here and made all these plans and were going to be here for a very long time,” Talwani said. “I have a group of people who are trying to follow the law. I am saying to you that, we as Americans, the United States needs to.”\n\nLower courts have largely supported keeping temporary protections for many groups. But in May, the Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to strip temporary legal protections from hundreds of thousands of immigrants for now, pushing the total number of people who could be newly exposed to deportation to nearly 1 million.\n\nThe justices lifted a lower-court order that kept humanitarian parole protections in place for more than 500,000 migrants from four countries: Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The decision came after the court allowed the administration to revoke temporary legal status from about 350,000 Venezuelan migrants in another case.\n\nThe court did not explain its reasoning in the brief order, as is typical on its emergency docket. Two justices publicly dissented.",

I was using two ways to compare them with each\nother, with three models that I'd trained locally, and with the original GPT-2 weights\nfrom OpenAI:\n\nHere were the results I got, sorted by the loss:\n\nNow, you'd expect there to be at least a loose correlation;\nthe lower the loss, the higher the IFT score. But, while we can see a difference\nbetween the OpenAI weights and our own, within our own there doesn't seem to be a\nlogical pattern.\n\nI think that the problem is that the results from the GPT-5.1\nLLM-as-a-judge are not consistent between models. That's not a complaint about\nthe code or its original design, of course -- it was originally written as part\nof the LLM book as a way of doing a quick test on an instruction fine-tuned model that\nwe'd spent the previous 238 pages writing -- just something that was a bit more efficient than\nreading hundreds of input/output pairs ourselves. It was never meant to be a tool\nto compare models in the way I'm using it now.\n\nIn this post I'll dig into why it doesn't work for this kind of thing, and see if that's something\nwe can change.\n\nLet's spec out the problem first. The instruction fine-tuning test trains our model\non the Alpaca dataset in order to\nlet it know how to follow instructions; that comprises a series of sequences like\nthis:\n\nIn the version I've settled on,\nI fine-tune on a training set of 85% of the samples, epoch by epoch, bailing out when the\nloss on a separate validation set of 5% of the samples starts rising. I then use the\nweights from the previous epoch -- that is, before validation loss started rising --\nto generate responses to the remaining 10% of the samples.\n\nOnce that's done, the script hits the OpenAI API, using GPT-5.1, default parameters for all\nof the options (eg. no explicit temperature) with queries like this:\n\nWe do that for every model-generated response in the test set, then take the\naverage of the scores and use that as our result.\n\nTo see why that's problematic, imagine this simple instruction with no separate input:\n\nOne response I've seen from my models was this:\n\nThat's obvious garbage, and should get a zero -- and GPT-5.1 consistently does that.\n\nAnother response, from OpenAI's original weights for their \"medium\" model (larger than\nthe ones I've been training), is this:\n\nThat's correct, so it deserves 100, or perhaps 95 due to being unnecessarily\nwordy (the answer \"Jane Austen\" is the suggested response in the dataset).\n\nOne of my models came up with that gem during an earlier eval. It's completely wrong,\nso it deserves a 0, right? And normally the GPT-5.1 model does that -- but sometimes\nit's a little more generous, and gives it a low, but non-zero score. When asked for\nits reason for that, it makes the logical point that while it's the wrong answer, at\nleast Sarah Palin is a real person. It's better than the \"the book wrote itself\"\ncomplete nonsense of the first response.\n\nThe problem is that the different runs against the different models are not consistent, as\nthey're all talking to GPT-5.1 separately. One model might find it in a harsh \"mood\",\nand get a lower rating than another model that found it at a more generous moment.\n\nI came to the conclusion that the best way to fix this is to do a \"batch\" -- that is, fine-tune\neach model on the Alpaca dataset that Raschka provides, and generate responses for\nthe test set and store them in a file. Then, once we've done that for all models,\nwe can score them all at once, prompting GPT-5.1 with something like this:\n\nThe theory is that doing it that way will mean that each individual query/response pair is graded consistently\nbetween models, even if there might still be inconsistencies between query/response pairs.\nThat hopefully means we'll get more consistent results and can compare the models\nbetter.\n\nRunning the first against each of our models, and then the second against all of the\noutput files, gives us this updated table (with links to the annotated JSON files\nin case anyone else wants to take a look):\n\n(Still sorted by loss so that you can compare it more easily with the one above.)\n\nThat's really interesting! The IFT score is still not correlated with the loss.\nBut there does appear to be a pattern.\n\nIt looks like we have three groups of models:\n\nI tried running the LLM-as-a-judge scoring script a few times, just to make sure\nthis wasn't some kind of random weirdness, but the pattern was always the same:\nthe OpenAI weights, the cloud FineWeb 8x A100 40 GiB, and the two local Local FineWeb-Edu\nmodels always got the best IFT scores, though sometimes they swapped positions (apart from the\nOpenAI medium model, which was of course always at the top). The other cloud\nFineWeb models and the local FineWeb one were consistently scored much lower.\n\nA hypothesis: there are two things that contribute to how good a model is at these\nIFT tests:\n\nOr to put it another way -- some of these models are smart but not knowledgeable, while\nothers are knowledgeable but not smart, and some are neither.\nI think that could explain what we're seeing here. While OpenAI never published\ntheir \"WebText\" dataset for GPT-2, the paper\ndescribes it as\n\na new web scrape which emphasizes\n document quality. To do this we only scraped web pages\n which have been curated/filtered by humans. Manually\n filtering a full web scrape would be exceptionally expensive\n so as a starting point, we scraped all outbound links from\n Reddit, a social media platform, which received at least 3\n karma.\n\nNow, the FineWeb dataset is quite similar, though I think it's a tad more curated than that.\nBut OpenAI trained\ntheir models for quite some time and did lots of tricks to get the loss as low as\npossible.\n\nonly the most \"educational\" data. Models trained on it, you might think, would\nknow more facts for a given amount of training.\n\nSo we can imagine the OpenAI models are smart but not knowledgeable, as we can our\ncloud FineWeb 8x A100 40 GiB model, which (I believe due to an accidentally-near-optimal batch\nsize) worked out well in terms of loss. They were trained on relatively sloppy datasets\nbut turned out reasonably well. Their intelligence makes up for some of their lack of\nknowledge.\n\nOur other cloud trains and the local FineWeb one are dumb and not\nknowledgeable; they were trained on the low-information FineWeb dataset, but they didn't\nwind up with a particularly amazing loss. So they get low scores.\n\nAnd finally, our local FineWeb-Edu models are still dumb, but they make up for it\n\nWell, it sounds plausible ;-) And I'd like to spend some time digging in to see if there's any indication\nif it's actually true. But after an afternoon of poking around the results, I can't really get\na handle on whether it is, or indeed how you'd test that hypothesis in any real\ndepth.\n\nTBH, I think this has zoomed so far past my \"no side quests\" limit that it's not even\nvisible in the rear view mirror, so it's probably best to shelve it as a\n\"cool idea, bro\" for now. Learning about how to run sensible evals, and how to work out\nwhat they're saying, will have to be a task for another day. I will keep on doing these\nIFT tests for future models, though, just out of interest.\n\nSo: let's get back to our regular scheduled LLM training. Next up, how do we\nupload our models to Hugging Face quickly and easily so that other people can\nplay with them.",

    "fullText": "On Jan. 7, the U.S. Supreme Court deferred ruling on the litigation challenging President Donald Trump's global tariffs\n\nThe new date for the next ruling is set for Jan. 14.\n\nWhen Trump announced sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs targeting countries across the world on Apr. 2, 2025, a day he dubbed \"Liberation Day,\" he invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).\n\nThe administration had argued that trade deficits constituted a national emergency and the president didn't need to consult with Congress to levy global tariffs.\n\nSeveral businesses affected by the decision and 12 U.S. states, mostly Democratic-governed, then went to the Supreme Court to challenge Trump's tariffs.\n\nIf the court rules that the president was wrong in invoking the emergency powers, the Trump administration will have to reimburse importers who already have paid the duties. The reimbursement is estimated to be more than $133.5 billion as per a Reuters report.\n\nBut the administration could get away with only limited repayments if the court decides to grant limited powers to the president under IEEPA.\n\nThe court's decision carries far-reaching implications for not only the global economy but also the crypto market.\n\nThe digital assets market got increasingly tied to Wall Street last year and Trump's tariff announcements frequently rattled the markets throughout 2025.\n\nIn fact, it was Trump's threat to hike tariffs on China on Oct. 10 last year that triggered the crypto flash crash in which more than $19 billion got wiped out in a day.\n\nWealthy trader moves millions ahead of Trump’s ‘big’ economic speech\n\nMysterious trader bets millions ahead of the Fed’s big announcement\n\nMysterious traders are selling ahead of Trump's 9PM address to the nation\n\nAhead of key policy announcements, mysterious crypto traders often place market orders and net millions of dollars.\n\nAs reported earlier, a trader made millions by shorting cryptocurrencies ahead of Trump's China announcement on Oct. 10.\n\nRecently, a crypto trader on Polymarket profited over $400,000 by betting on Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro's ouster.\n\nNotably, the trader had created his Polymarket account only a day earlier, triggering speculations of insider trading.\n\nOnce again, a crypto whale placed an order as markets buzzed with reports of a Supreme Court ruling expected on Jan. 9.",

    "fullText": "ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — A judge’s ruling that a Trump administration prosecutor in upstate New York was serving unlawfully has spilled into another case — with the same judge saying he can’t obtain tax return information in a criminal investigation because he lacks authority.\n\nThe ruling Thursday against prosecutor John Sarcone from U.S. District Judge Lorna G. Schofield came the same day the judge disqualified Sarcone from overseeing investigations into Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James. In that case, Schofield ruled that Sarcone was not lawfully serving as acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of New York and that any “of his past or future acts taken in that capacity are void or voidable.”\n\nSarcone is among the prosecutors around the country found by federal judges to lack authority after the Republican administration used unusual maneuvers to place them or keep them in their posts without U.S. Senate confirmation.\n\nCarl Tobias, a professor of law at the University of Richmond, said Schofield's ruling was consistent with previous decisions.\n\n“It does seem like more and more courts are coming around to this view,” he said.\n\nIn a separate ruling Thursday, Schofield denied Sarcone's application for a court order directing the IRS to disclose tax return information for a limited liability company as part of a criminal investigation. The application remains sealed and it's not clear who filed the tax returns sought in the Oct. 2 request.\n\nApplications for that tax information can only be made by officials holding specific positions, such as U.S. attorneys. The Manhattan judge said Sarcone lacked authority to authorize the application because he was not lawfully serving as acting U.S. attorney — mirroring her reasoning in the case involving James.\n\nAn email seeking comment was sent to the northern district.\n\nCourts in New Jersey, Nevada and California have held that similarly installed acting U.S. attorneys lacked lawful authority. Trump’s former personal attorney, Alina Habba,resigned as the top federal prosecutor for New Jersey in December after an appeals court said she had been serving unlawfully.",

    "fullText": "Judge says there is plenty of evidence to suggest OpenAI’s leaders made assurances nonprofit structure would be kept\n\nElon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI is to go to trial after a US judge said there is plenty of evidence to support the billionaire’s case.\n\nThe world’s richest man, who co-founded OpenAI, is suing the ChatGPT developer and its chief executive, Sam Altman, over claims its leaders violated the organisation’s founding mission by shifting to a for-profit model.\n\nThe US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, told a hearing there was plenty of evidence that suggested OpenAI’s leaders made assurances that its original nonprofit structure was going to be maintained.\n\nShe said there were enough disputed facts to let a jury consider the claims at a trial scheduled for March, rather than decide the issues herself. Rogers said she would issue a written order after the hearing that addresses OpenAI’s attempt to throw out the case.\n\nThe court dispute comes amid a broader showdown over dominance in the market for generative artificial intelligence. Musk’s xAI and its chatbot Grok are competing with OpenAI and other technology developers.\n\nMusk is seeking unspecified monetary damages from what he calls “ill-gotten gains” by OpenAI.\n\nIn a statement after the hearing, OpenAI said: “Mr Musk’s lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial.”\n\nMusk’s startup xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSteven Molo, a lead trial attorney for the billionaire and xAI, said after the hearing: “We look forward to presenting all the evidence of the defendants’ wrongdoing to the jury.”\n\nMusk contends he contributed about $38m (£28m), roughly 60% of OpenAI’s early funding, along with strategic guidance and credibility, based on assurances that the organisation would remain a nonprofit dedicated to the public benefit.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses OpenAI co-founders Altman and Greg Brockman of plotting a for-profit switch to enrich themselves, culminating in multibillion-dollar deals with Microsoft and a recent restructuring.\n\nOpenAI, Altman and Brockman have denied the claims, and have described Musk as “a frustrated commercial competitor seeking to slow down a mission-driven market leader”.\n\nMicrosoft, which is also a defendant, urged Rogers to throw out Musk’s claims against it. A lawyer for Microsoft said there was no evidence that the company “aided and abetted” OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft has been approached for comment.\n\nLawyers for OpenAI at the hearing asked Rogers to enter judgment against Musk, contending that he had not shown enough of a factual basis to sustain his allegations including fraud and breach of contract.\n\nOpenAI also contends that Musk failed to bring his allegations in a timely manner. The judge said the jury would be asked to weigh whether the lawsuit was filed outside the statute of limitations.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge Tuesday ordered Trump ally Lindsey Halligan to explain why she continues to call herself the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia even though another judge determined in November that she had been unlawfully appointed to the position.\n\nU.S. District Judge David Novak of Richmond issued a three-page order demanding to know why Halligan is still serving in the post. Halligan, who unsuccessfully prosecuted former FBI Direct James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, is also referred to as U.S. attorney by the Justice Department in official documents.\n\nThe judge's order is unusual because he issued it on his own, not at the request of defense attorneys. It came in a case involving a carjacking and attempted bank robbery suspect who was indicted last month.\n\nNovak gave Halligan seven days to respond in writing “explaining the basis for ... identification of herself as the United States Attorney, notwithstanding Judge Currie’s contrary ruling. She shall also set forth the reasons why this Court should not strike Ms. Halligan’s identification of herself as United States Attorney from the indictment in this matter.”\n\nThe judge’s order goes on to say Halligan \"shall further explain why her identification does not constitute a false or misleading statement.\" Novak also alluded to potential disciplinary action and demanded that Halligan sign her response.\n\nThe U.S. attorney’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.\n\nIn late November, U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie found that the Justice Department had violated the Constitution by appointing Halligan as U.S. attorney. That finding led to the dismissal of criminal cases against Comey and James.\n\nCurrie ruled that all actions “flowing from Ms. Halligan’s defective appointment, including securing and signing Mr. Comey’s indictment, were unlawful exercises of executive power.” She issued a separate, similar ruling in the James case, saying Halligan had exercised power she “did not lawfully possess.”\n\nNovak acknowledged Tuesday that the November ruling regarding Halligan’s appointment had been appealed but said that since the order had not been paused, it remains the “binding precedent of the district and is not subject to being ignored.”\n\nOther judges in the district have previously expressed their frustration with Halligan, including one who now places an asterisk next to Halligan’s name on every court document and next to it refers to Currie's ruling from November.\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

Each attendee was revealed through a custom Royal Rumble match using the WWE 2K25 video game on streaming platform Twitch.\n\nSeven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady, who won the inaugural Fanatics Games in 2024 and has expanded his brand with a line of card shops across the nation, will again bring his star power to the event.\n\nThe initial lineup of talent also includes: Skattebo, Travis Scott, Kevin Hart, Jay-Z, Karl-Anthony Towns, Josh Hart, Freddie Freeman, Mike Tyson, Malik Nabers, Cody Rhodes, Patrick Ewing, Jaxson Dart, Trae Young, Midge Purce, CC Sabathia, Allen Iverson, Grant Hill, Iyo Sky, Liv Morgan, Jordan Chiles, Jey Uso, Klay Thompson, Charlotte Flair, Becky Lynch, Randy Orton, Stephanie Vaquer, Tiffany Stratton, and Bianca Belair.\n\nAdditional guests are expected to be announced at a later date.\n\nFanatics Fest 2026 returns to the Javits Center on July 16-19 with an expanded four-day show. Sunday’s event will overlap with the 2026 FIFA World Cup final, which will be played just miles away at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\nFanatics Events CEO Lance Fensterman told cllct in October the show hopes to capitalize on a “once-in-a-probably-lifetime opportunity” by collaborating with FIFA. Details on what collaborations and activations at the event will look like have yet to be announced.\n\nA crowd of roughly 70,000 fans attended the first Fanatics Fest in 2024. That number grew to 125,000 in 2025 and is expected to be larger in 2026 with the event securing 25% more space from the Javits Center.\n\nWant more stories like this? \n\nBen Burrows is a reporter and editor for cllct, the premier company for collectible culture.

    "title": "'This case is going to trial': Judge rejects Sam Altman's efforts to toss Elon Musk's OpenAI lawsuit",
    "description": "An Oakland federal court judge just paved the way for a Musk-Altman showdown, rejecting OpenAI's efforts to end the case ahead of trial.",
    "fullText": "It looks like Sam Altman and Elon Musk are headed for a courtroom showdown.\n\nDuring a hearing on Wednesday, a California judge said she plans to reject Altman's lawyers' last-ditch efforts to end Musk's case against OpenAI and its CEO.\n\n\"This case is going to trial,\" US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said at a hearing to consider whether the evidence was sufficient to warrant a jury trial.\n\n\"I think there's plenty of evidence,\" she said, referring to Musk's case. \"It's circumstantial, but that's how these things work.\"\n\nIn his lawsuit filed in 2024, Musk accused OpenAI of misleading him in its decision to abandon its original nonprofit mission and structure in favor of a profit-oriented model, including through its partnership with Microsoft.\n\nMusk says he donated $38 million to the maker of ChatGPT over the years to support its mission to develop AI for the benefit of humankind. The Tesla CEO is seeking monetary damages, as well as a judgment to void Microsoft's licensing agreement with OpenAI.\n\nAt a hearing on Wednesday, an Oakland federal court judge said she felt there was enough evidence that Musk may have been deceived to allow the case to move forward to a jury. A trial is scheduled for March.\n\n\"There were assurances made, and promises made, that the structure would be maintained,\" she said. \"There was lots of information that was not shared.\"\n\nThe judge added that she also felt \"there are strong arguments by the defense.\"\n\n\"I think the jury is going to get to decide,\" she said.\n\nOpenAI lawyers have denied Musk's allegations, saying Musk was aware of the company's for-profit plans as early as 2018. OpenAI has also pointed out that it is still controlled by OpenAI's nonprofit arm.\n\n\"Mr Musk's lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial,\" a spokesperson for OpenAI told Business Insider. \"We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best resourced nonprofits ever.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMusk has filed multiple lawsuits against OpenAI. Most recently, his AI company, xAI, sued OpenAI in September, accusing it of stealing trade secrets and targeting its employees for recruitment. At the time, an OpenAI spokesperson told Business that the lawsuit is \"the latest chapter in Mr. Musk's ongoing harassment.\"\n\nMusk helped found OpenAI in 2015, but left the company in 2018. At the time he said his work with OpenAI could present a conflict of interest with Tesla's AI ambitions.\n\nSince, Musk has repeatedly criticized Altman and OpenAI, including the company's structure. Musk later went on to launch his own AI company, xAI, in 2023.",

    "fullText": "Jan 6 (Reuters) - The 92-year-old judge overseeing the Nicolas Maduro case has said he displays a Hebrew scripture from the Torah on the wall of his Manhattan chambers: “Tzedek, tzedek tirdof” — “Justice, justice you shall pursue.\"\n\nAn Orthodox Jew who has been ​on the bench for almost three decades, U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein has been outspoken about how he tries to promote fairness ‌and the impact of his faith on his judicial philosophy.\n\nHellerstein opened the court hearing on Monday by saying he wants a fair trial for the ousted Venezuelan leader, who pleaded not ‌guilty on Monday to narco-terrorism charges.\n\n\"That's my job, and that's my intent,\" Hellerstein said.\n\nON THE SEVENTH DAY HE CONTEMPLATES\n\nHellerstein said in a 2020 podcast that he schedules sentencing hearings for Fridays, so that he can spend Shabbat — the Jewish sabbath from Friday sunset to Saturday nightfall — reflecting on whether the prison sentence he handed down was appropriate.\n\nHellerstein has ruled against President Donald Trump in recent years. He has also spoken up when he believes lawyers are not ⁠best serving their clients.\n\nIn a 2013 law review article, ‌he wrote that some lawyers were \"outraged\" and accused him of \"arrogation of power\" when he rejected a $675 million settlement negotiated between New York City and injured first responders who raced to the World Trade Center after the attacks of ‍September 11, 2001.\n\nHellerstein concluded that, while no statute or rule clearly addressed whether the deal needed his blessing, he had inherent authority to reject it as inadequate.\n\nThe attorneys ended up presenting Hellerstein with a new settlement that added $125 million for victims.\n\nHellerstein \"is a man of strongly held convictions and he seeks to find a way to harmonize ​the law with his understanding of justice,\" said Mitchell Epner, a former federal prosecutor who has observed Hellerstein on the bench.\n\nHellerstein has spoken ‌candidly about how his Jewish values affect his decision-making.\n\n\"As a judge, and as a Jew, I consider that everything I do reflects God and affects His image,\" he wrote in the 2013 article.\n\nIn the 2020 podcast, Hellerstein said he believes he was \"the first Orthodox boy employed by a gentile or Jewish firm in New York City.\"\n\n\"I'm pleased to say that after me there were others, and some credited me with having broken the precedent,\" Hellerstein said.\n\nHellerstein already had a long career before President Bill Clinton nominated him to the federal bench in 1998.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1960, Hellerstein served in the ⁠Judge Advocate General's Corps, the legal arm of the United States Army.\n\nIn 1960, Hellerstein ​joined the now-defunct firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, where he ended up practicing for much ​of his career.\n\nA HISTORY OF REBUKING TRUMP'S LEGAL GAMBITS\n\nIn a high-profile case in 2020, Hellerstein ordered the release of former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen, after Trump's Justice Department tried to revoke his home confinement and return him to jail.\n\nHellerstein ‍concluded Trump's administration was retaliating against Cohen ⁠for writing a book.\n\nIn 2023, Hellerstein denied a request by Trump to move to federal court his New York criminal case relating to a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Trump was tried in state court and found guilty of 34 felony ⁠counts.\n\nIn May 2025, Hellerstein rejected an effort by the Trump administration to use a wartime law to send alleged gang members to Venezuela, saying the men had been improperly denied ‌their day in court.\n\n“This is the United States of America,\" he said. \"People are being thrown out of the country because of ‌their tattoos.”",

    "fullText": "A new study has bolstered a scathing dissent from liberal Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson that warned the court appeared to favor the rich.\n\nThe study, published Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research, investigated whether the Supreme Court has contributed to rising income inequality by ruling in favor of policies that favor wealthy parties.\n\nIts authors—two academics from Columbia University in New York and one from Yale University—found that in cases pitting the rich against the poor, Republican appointees were far more likely than their Democratic colleagues to side with the wealthier party.\n\nBack in 1953, Democratic and Republican appointees were statistically indistinguishable on the issue, with justices appointed by members of both parties favoring the rich in 45 percent of cases on average.\n\nThe average Democratic justice cast a “pro-rich” vote—which was defined as a vote that would directly shift resources to the party that was more likely to be wealthy, including votes that supported businesses over consumers or workers—just 35 percent of the time.\n\n“The results reveal a steady increase in polarization, mostly due to Republican appointees whose decisions rise from about 50 percent pro-rich share to a 70 percent pro-rich share over the course of 70 years,” the study’s authors, Andrea Prat, a Columbia economics professor, Jacob Spitz, a Columbia PhD student, Fiona Scott Morton, a Yale economics professor, and wrote.\n\nThe findings also supported a June dissent authored by Brown Jackson, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe justices held 7-2 that oil and gas companies had legal standing to challenge California’s environmental regulations requiring automakers to produce more electric vehicles and fewer gasoline-powered ones.\n\n“This case gives fodder to the unfortunate perception that moneyed interests enjoy an easier road to relief in this Court than ordinary citizens,” Brown Jackson wrote. “I worry that the fuel industry’s gain comes at a reputational cost for this Court, which is already viewed by many as being overly sympathetic to corporate interests.”\n\nThat perception could be contributing to an overall drop in public confidence in the court, according to the Times. The Daily Beast has reached out to the Supreme Court for comment.\n\nThe court’s favorability rating has plunged by 22 points over the past five years, from 70 percent in 2020 to a near-record low 48 percent late last year, the Pew Research Center reported in September.\n\nAnd although a vast majority of Americans, or 86 percent, think the justices should be non-partisan, 56 percent said the justices were doing only a fair or poor job of keeping their political views out of their legal decision-making.",

    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS (AP) — Nathan Chasing Horse, the former “Dances with Wolves” actor accused of sexual abuse, was temporarily thrown out of court Monday after he disrupted proceedings with demands he be allowed to fire his defense attorney a week before trial.\n\nJudge Jessica Peterson in Las Vegas ordered his jury trial to proceed next week as planned.\n\nChasing Horse has pleaded not guilty to 21 charges, including allegations that he sexually assaulted women and girls and that he filmed himself sexually abusing a girl younger than 14. Prosecutors allege he used his reputation as a spiritual leader and healer to take advantage of Native American women and girls over two decades.\n\nPeterson ordered him removed from court Monday for trying to speak over her. He argued that his attorney, Craig Mueller, did not come to visit him and did not file timely. He asked that a public defender who previously represented him be his attorney.\n\nMueller, a private defense attorney, told the court his client was ready and privately told the judge that one of his investigators had visited with Chasing Horse. He declined to comment to The Associated Press.\n\nBest known for portraying the character Smiles A Lot in the 1990 movie “Dances with Wolves,” Chasing Horse was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, which is home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.\n\nAfter starring in the Oscar-winning film, according to prosecutors, Chasing Horse began propping himself up as a self-proclaimed Lakota medicine man while traveling around North America to perform healing ceremonies. When he was arrested in 2023, he was living in a North Las Vegas house with his five wives, according to prosecutors.\n\nThe case sent shock waves across Indian Country. The original indictment was dismissed in 2024 after the Nevada Supreme Court ruled prosecutors abused the grand jury process when they provided a definition of grooming as evidence without any expert testimony. However, the court left open the possibility of charges being refiled, and a new indictment was brought later that year.\n\nProsecutors claim Chasing Horse led a cult called The Circle, and his followers believed he could speak with spirits. His victims went to him for medical help, according to a transcript from a grand jury hearing.\n\nProsecutors expect the trial to last three weeks. It is scheduled to begin Monday.",

    "fullText": "Embattled Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, who was convicted of obstruction last month for helping an immigrant evade federal officers, has sent her resignation letter to the governor.\n\nThe letter was sent Saturday. Republicans had been making plans to impeach her ever since her Dec. 19 conviction. A spokesperson for Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, said his office received Dugan's letter, and he would work to fill the vacancy without delay.\n\nDugan wrote that over the past decade she handled thousands of cases with “a commitment to treat all persons with dignity and respect, to act justly, deliberately and consistently, and to maintain a courtroom with the decorum and safety the public deserves.”\n\nBut she said the case against her is too big of a distraction.\n\n“As you know, I am the subject of unprecedented federal legal proceedings, which are far from concluded but which present immense and complex challenges that threaten the independence of our judiciary. I am pursuing this fight for myself and for our independent judiciary,” Dugan said in her letter.\n\nLast April, federal prosecutors accused Dugan of distracting federal officers trying to arrest a Mexican immigrant outside her courtroom and leading the man out through a private door. A federal jury convicted her of felony obstruction.\n\nThe case against Dugan was highlighted by President Donald Trump as he pressed ahead with his sweeping immigration crackdown. Democrats insisted the administration was trying to make an example of Dugan to blunt judicial opposition to the operation.\n\nRepublican Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos praised Dugan's decision.\n\n“I’m glad Dugan did the right thing by resigning and followed the clear direction from the Wisconsin Constitution,\" Vos said.\n\nDemocrat Ann Jacobs, who is chair of the Wisconsin Elections Commission board, said she agreed with Dugan that Milwaukee should have a permanent judge in place while this fight plays out.\n\n“Despite her situation, she is ever the champion of justice, wanting to remove the judiciary from a political battle over her fate. I’m sure this is terribly hard for her but she is true to her faith and her principles,” Jacobs said in a post on X.\n\nOn April 18, immigration officers went to the Milwaukee County courthouse after learning 31-year-old Eduardo Flores-Ruiz had reentered the country illegally and was scheduled to appear before Dugan for a hearing in a state battery case.\n\nDugan confronted agents outside her courtroom and directed them to the office of her boss, Milwaukee County Chief Judge Carl Ashley, because she told them their administrative warrant wasn’t sufficient grounds to arrest Flores-Ruiz.\n\nAfter the agents left, she led Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out a private jury door. Agents spotted Flores-Ruiz in the corridor, followed him outside and arrested him after a foot chase. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced in November he had been deported.",

    "description": "The teenage daughter of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made her first known visit to a sacred family mausoleum, a step that experts say bolstered her status as her father's potential heir.  The visit, which occurred on New Year’s Day on Thursday, even sparked speculation that the girl, reportedly named Kim Ju Ae and aged about 13, could be named a high-level official at the upcoming ruling Workers’ Party congress.

    "fullText": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The teenage daughter of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made her first known visit to a sacred family mausoleum, a step that experts say bolstered her status as her father's potential heir.\n\nThe visit, which occurred on New Year’s Day on Thursday, even sparked speculation that the girl, reportedly named Kim Ju Ae and aged about 13, could be named a high-level official at the upcoming ruling Workers’ Party congress.\n\nThe palace is “a place that symbolizes legitimacy of the North Korean regime” and her visit there ahead of the Workers' Party congress is a politically orchestrated move, said Cheong Seong-Chang, deputy head of the private Sejong Institute in South Korea.\n\nKim Jong Un, 41, is the third generation of his family to rule North Korea since the country's foundation in 1948. He often marks key state anniversaries by visiting the Kumsusan palace and paying respect to his father Kim Jong Il and grandfather Kim Il Sung.\n\nCheong predicted that Kim Jong Un could give his daughter the first secretary post at the Workers' Party, the party's No. 2 job, at the congress. Other experts say she is too young to accept such a high-profile post and might be provided with lower-level jobs.\n\nThe congress, the first of its kind in five years, is meant to establish new priorities in state policies and reshuffle officials. North Korea hasn't said when it will hold it, but the National Intelligence Service, South Korea's spy agency, said it likely will be held either in January or February.\n\nSince first appearing in state media in November 2022, Kim Ju Ae has accompanied her father at a slew of events including military parades and missile launches. In September, Kim Jong Un brought her on his trip to Beijing. During New Years' Day celebrations this week, she kissed her father on the cheek, showing their closeness.\n\nIn January 2024, the NIS said it viewed Kim Ju Ae as her father's likely heir. Some outside experts disagree with that assessment, citing Kim Jong Un’s relatively young age and the extremely male-dominated nature of North Korea’s power hierarchy. The NIS told lawmakers in November that Kim appeared to have no major health problems.\n\nRevealing the young Kim Ju Ae was a surprise to foreign experts because neither Kim Jong Un nor Kim Jong Il were mentioned in North Korean state media before they became adults. Some observers say Kim Jong Un likely aimed to shore up public support for his plan to extend the family's rule by repeatedly disclosing Kim Ju Ae in public events.",

    "fullText": "MLB.com | Brian Murphy: Tatsuya Imai, the top NPB player on the free agent market, is reportedly meeting with teams in Los Angeles ahead of his Friday afternoon deadline to sign. It’s unclear whether the Yankees are among those teams meeting in-person with Imai, though reports still link them, along with the Phillies and White Sox, to the right-hander. Imai, just 27-years-old, posted a 1.92 ERA over 163.2 innings in NPB last season, and may command a nine-figure guarantee.\n\nNew York Daily News | Peter Sblendorio: Now that the first quarter of the 21st century is in the books, the Daily News picked their All-Century New York team, selecting the best player from the last 25 years for each of New York’s teams. The top Yankee? None other than Aaron Judge. Judge had to beat out Derek Jeter, who won two World Series and racked up over 2,600 hits in the 2000’s, Alex Rodriguez, who won two MVP’s as a Yankee in the 21st century, and many other greats, but it’s clear that Judge’s resume has no peer. There are some debates with the other NY teams as well; Jalen Brunson, who’s played just 3.5 seasons in New York, is the Knicks’ All-Century selection, while Michael Strahan gets the nod over Eli Manning for the Giants.\n\nMLB.com | Sarah Langs: To close out 2025, the great Sarah Langs highlighted at least one amazing stat for each team from last season. For the Yankees, it of course came from Aaron Judge. Judge led MLB in batting average, OBP, and slugging percentage, the triple-slash triple crown, becoming just the fifth man in the expansion era to do so. He also set a record with 20 first-inning home runs.",

    "fullText": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — U.S. immigration officials do not plan to detain Kilmar Abrego Garcia again as long as a judge’s order banning it stands, according to a Tuesday court filing.\n\nThe plans by President Donald Trump’s administration are the latest in the saga over the Salvadoran citizen’s case that has become a lightning rod for both sides of the immigration debate as he fights to remain in the U.S. after a mistaken deportation to his home country, where he was imprisoned.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement did make clear they would detain Abrego Garcia if the order was lifted, Liana J. Castano, assistant director for field operations, wrote in the filing.\n\nTrump officials have accused Abrego Garcia of being a member of the MS-13 gang, but he has vehemently denied the accusations and has no criminal record. The administration brought him back to the U.S. in June under a court order, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paula Xinis earlier this month questioned whether government officials could be trusted to follow orders barring them from taking Abrego Garcia back into immigration custody or deporting him.\n\nA Justice Department push to indict\n\nEarlier Tuesday, a newly unsealed order in the criminal case against Abrego Garcia revealed that high-level Justice Department officials pushed for his indictment, calling it a “top priority,” only after he was mistakenly deported and then ordered returned to the U.S.\n\nAbrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty in federal court to the human smuggling charges. He is seeking to have the case dismissed on the grounds that the prosecution is vindictive, arguing the Trump administration is targeting him as punishment for the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation.\n\nTo support that argument, he has asked the government to turn over documents that reveal how the decision was made to prosecute him in 2025 for an incident that occurred in 2022.\n\nAbrego Garcia had recently been in immigration custody for three months before Xinis ordered his release on Dec. 11. In that time, the government said it planned to deport him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Liberia.\n\nIn her Dec. 11 order, Xinis found that immigration officials had no viable plan to remove Abrego Garcia from the U.S. and said he could not be held indefinitely. She issued a separate order barring ICE from re-detaining him, at least for the time being. After a hearing on the issue, Xinis ordered the government to file the brief they released Tuesday outlining whether they planned to detain Abrego Garcia again.\n\nAbrego Garcia's human smuggling case stems from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee where he was pulled over for speeding with nine passengers in the car. State troopers discussed the possibility of human smuggling among themselves. However, he was ultimately allowed to leave with only a warning. The case was turned over to Homeland Security Investigations, but there is no record of any effort to charge him until April 2025, according to court records.\n\nThe newly unsealed Dec. 3 order from U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw compelled the government to provide some documents to Abrego Garcia and his attorneys, although it does not give a lot of detail on their contents.\n\nClaims of a ‘vindictive’ prosecution\n\nEarlier, Crenshaw found that there was “some evidence” that the prosecution of Abrego Garcia could be vindictive. He specifically cited a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on a Fox News program that seemed to suggest that the Department of Justice charged Abrego Garcia because he had won his wrongful deportation case.\n\nRob McGuire, who was the Acting U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee until late December, argued that those statements were irrelevant because he alone made the decision to prosecute, and he has no animus against Abrego Garcia.\n\nIn the unsealed order, Crenshaw writes, “Some of the documents suggest not only that McGuire was not a solitary decision-maker, but he in fact reported to others in DOJ and the decision to prosecute Abrego may have been a joint decision.”\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee released a statement saying: “The emails cited in Judge Crenshaw’s order, specifically Mr. McGuire’s email on May 15, 2025, confirm that the ultimate decision on whether to prosecute was made by career prosecutors based on the facts, evidence, and established DOJ practice. Communications with the Deputy Attorney General’s Office about a high-profile case are both required and routine.”\n\nThe email referenced was from McGuire to his staff saying Blanche “would like Garcia charged sooner rather than later,” according to Crenshaw's order.\n\nThe order also shows that Aakash Singh, who works under Blanche in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, contacted McGuire about Abrego Garcia's case on April 27, the same day that McGuire received a file on the case from Homeland Security Investigations. That was several days after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Abrego Garcia's favor on April 10.\n\nOn April 30, Singh said in an email to McGuire that the prosecution was a “top priority” for the Deputy Attorney General's Office, according to the order. Singh and McGuire continued to communicate about the prosecution. On May 18, Singh wrote to McGuire and others to hold the draft indictment until they got “clearance” to file it. “The implication is that ‘clearance’ would come from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General,” Crenshaw writes.\n\nA hearing on the motion to dismiss the human smuggling case on the basis of vindictive prosecution is scheduled for Jan. 28.",

Judge Amy Berman ruled that the CFPB should continue to get its funds from the Federal Reserve, despite the Fed operating at a loss, and that the White House's new legal argument about how the CFPB gets its funds is not valid.",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — The White House cannot lapse in its funding of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal district court judge ruled on Tuesday, only days before funds at the bureau would have likely run out and the consumer finance agency would have no money to pay its employees.\n\nJudge Amy Berman ruled that the CFPB should continue to get its funds from the Federal Reserve, despite the Fed operating at a loss, and that the White House's new legal argument about how the CFPB gets its funds is not valid.\n\nAt the heart of this case is whether Russell Vought, President Donald Trump's budget director and the acting director of the CFPB, can effectively shut down the agency and lay off all of the bureau's employees. The CFPB has largely been inoperable since President Trump has sworn into office nearly a year ago. Its employees are mostly forbidden from doing any work, and most of the bureau's operations this year has been to unwind the work it did under President Biden and even under Trump's first term.\n\nVought himself has made comments where he has made it clear that his intention is to effectively shut down the CFPB. The White House earlier this year issued a “reduction in force” for the CFPB, which would have furloughed or laid off much of the bureau.\n\nThe National Treasury Employees Union, which represents the workers at the CFPB, has been mostly successful in court to stop the mass layoffs and furloughs. The union sued Vought earlier this year and won a preliminary injunction stopping the layoffs while the union's case continues through the legal process.\n\nIn recent weeks, the White House has used a new line of argument to potentially get around the court's injunction. The argument is that the Federal Reserve has no “combined earnings” at the moment to fund the CFPB’s operations. The CFPB gets its funding from the Fed through expected quarterly payments.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been operating at a paper loss since 2022 as a result of the central bank trying to combat inflation, the first time in the Fed's entire history its been operating at a loss. The Fed holds bonds on its balance sheet from a period of low interest rates during the COVID-19 pandemic, but currently has to pay out higher interest rates to banks who hold their deposits at the central bank. The Fed has been recording a “deferred asset” on its balance sheet which it expects will be paid down in the next few years as the low interest bonds mature off the Fed's balance sheet.\n\nBecause of this loss on paper, the White House has argued there are no “combined earnings” for the CFPB to draw on. The CFPB has operated since 2011, including under President Trump’s first term, drawing on the Fed’s operating budget.\n\nWhite House lawyers sent a notice to the court in early November, where they argued that the CFPB would run out of appropriations in early 2026, using the “combined earnings” argument, and does not expect to get any additional appropriations from Congress.\n\nThis combined earnings legal argument is not entirely new. It has floated in conservative legal circles going back to when the Federal Reserve started operating at a loss. The Office of Legal Counsel, which acts as the government's legal advisors, adopted this legal theory in a memo on November 7. However, this idea has never been tested in court.\n\nIn her opinion, Berman said the OLC and Vought were using this legal theory to get around the court's injunction instead of allowing the case to be decided on merits. A trial on whether the CFPB employees' union can sue Vought over the layoffs is currently scheduled for February 2026.\n\n“It appears that defendants’ new understanding of “combined earnings” is an unsupported and transparent attempt to starve the CPFB of funding and yet another attempt to achieve the very end the Court’s injunction was put in place to prevent,\" Berman wrote in an opinion.\n\n“We’re very pleased that the court made clear what should have been obvious: Vought can’t justify abandoning the agency’s obligations or violating a court order by manufacturing a lack of funding,” said Jennifer Bennett of Gupta Wessler LLP, who is representing the CFPB employees in the case.\n\nA White House spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Berman's opinion.",

    "fullText": "MIAMI (AP) — U.S. Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick reiterated her innocence Monday outside a Miami federal courthouse, where she faces charges of conspiring to steal $5 million in federal COVID-19 disaster funds.\n\nCherfilus-McCormick was scheduled to be arraigned, but her attorney requested the proceeding be rescheduled to Jan. 20 so that she could finalize her legal team. Prosecutors didn't object, and Judge Lisette Reid agreed to the new date. The hearing lasted less than five minutes.\n\n“I just want to make it very clear that I am innocent,” Cherfilus-McCormick said immediately after leaving court. “In no way did I steal any kind of funds. I'm committed to the people of Florida and my district.”\n\nCherfilus-McCormick, a Democrat, has pleaded not guilty. She is facing 15 federal counts that accuse her of stealing funds that had been overpaid to her family's health care company, Trinity Healthcare Services, in 2021. The company had a contract to register people for COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\nCherfilus-McCormick's attorney, David Oscar Markus, said the case involves mistakes that generally aren't even misdemeanors, let alone felonies. He said he believes the case is politically motivated.\n\nCherfilus-McCormick was arrested in November and then freed on a $60,000 bond. In addition to bail, the judge said Cherfilus-McCormick must surrender her personal passport, and is allowed to travel only between Florida, Washington, D.C., Maryland and the Eastern District of Virginia.\n\nShe has been allowed to retain her congressional passport so she can perform certain duties for her job.\n\nAccording to the federal indictment, prosecutors said that within two months of receiving the funds in 2021, more than $100,000 had been spent on a 3-carat yellow diamond ring for the congresswoman.\n\nThe health care company owned by Cherfilus-McCormick's family had received payments through a COVID-19 vaccination staffing contract, the indictment said. Her brother, Edwin Cherfilus, requested $50,000, but they mistakenly received $5 million and didn't return the difference.\n\nProsecutors said the funds received by Trinity Healthcare were distributed to various accounts, including to friends and relatives who then donated to Cherfilus-McCormick's campaign for Congress.\n\nCherfilus-McCormick won a special election in January 2022 to represent Florida’s 20th District, which includes parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, after Rep. Alcee Hastings died in 2021.\n\nThe charges she faces include theft of government funds; making and receiving straw donor contributions; aiding and assisting a false and fraudulent statement on a tax return; money laundering, as well as conspiracy charges associated with each of those counts.\n\nAccording to a previous statement provided by Cherfilus-McCormick's chief of staff, she doesn't plan to resign from office. She said she has cooperated with “every lawful request” and will continue to do so until the matter is resolved.",

(AP) — A Georgia judge on Monday ordered a temporary pause to a December execution that was already put on hold, saying questions about the state's clemency process must be addressed before Stacey Humphreys ' death sentence could be carried out.\n\nHumphreys, 52, was facing scheduled execution Dec. 17 but the procedure was paused just days before he was to have received a lethal injection.\n\nHe was convicted of malice murder and other crimes in the 2003 shooting deaths of Cyndi Williams, 33, and Lori Brown, 21, at the real estate office where they worked in Cobb County, northwest of Atlanta.\n\nAt issue: Humphreys' lawyers contend that two members of Georgia's parole board have conflicts of interest which would taint their participation in a clemency hearing.\n\nHumphreys’ lawyers earlier this month filed a petition asking a judge to order the two members of the parole board to recuse themselves from considering his clemency petition.\n\nThe lawyers said one of those board members, Kimberly McCoy, was previously a victim advocate with the Cobb County district attorney’s office at the time of Humphreys’ trial and was assigned to work with victims in the case.\n\nAnother board member, Wayne Bennett, was the sheriff in Glynn County, where the trial was moved because of pretrial publicity. Humphreys’ lawyers say Bennett oversaw security for the jurors and Humphreys himself during the case.\n\nIn an order filed Monday, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney wrote that “pressing ‘pause’ on the execution machinery until we answer the non-frivolous question raised by Petitioner concerning the proper composition of the Board for his clemency hearing is the correct course of action.”\n\nHe ordered lawyers for both sides to file additional legal briefs on the issue by Jan. 19.\n\nAdditionally, the judge wrote in his order that Humphreys deserves to have the conflict of interest question researched and argued thoroughly so that a parole board free of conflicts of interest can decide his case at a clemency hearing.",

    "fullText": "If appeal fails, every person in UK who made App Store purchases between 2015 and 2024 could be entitled to compensation\n\nApple is seeking to overturn a landmark £1.5bn court ruling on behalf of millions of UK customers, which found the company overcharged them for years in its App Store.\n\nThe iPhone maker has applied to the court of appeal to challenge a verdict that campaigners heralded as the start of a “tidal shift against big tech”.\n\nIt is one of a cluster of cases heading towards trial in 2026 as consumers realise the mounting cost of paying up to 30% commission – what campaigners call the “Apple tax” – on apps and in-app purchases, which more people rely on for activities from fitness to dating.\n\nThe appeal, if allowed, involves one of several class action suits against Apple and Google in which consumers, small businesses and entrepreneurs are demanding over £6bn in combined compensation. The class action cases use an opt-out system that means millions of people can be represented at once in claims of breaches of competition law.\n\n“It’s definitely a tipping point,” said Dr Rachael Kent, an academic at King’s College London who won the £1.5bn case against Apple on behalf of 36 million UK consumers. “People are pushing back against the harms from digital worlds, which they have to be living in and through every day and the financial implications of that,” she said.\n\nKent added that the win in October still felt “a bit pinch me”. If Apple’s appeal fails, every person in the UK who made App Store purchases between 2015 and 2024 could be entitled to a payout.\n\nIn the suite of class action cases, Apple and Google are accused of overcharging British consumers and developers in their app stores and, in the case of Apple, of “trapping” and overcharging customers with its iCloud data storage service.\n\nInstead of up to 30%, Apple should be charging commission of 17.5% when selling apps and 10% on in-app purchases, while app developers should pay 10%, the competition appeal tribunal found in Kent’s case.\n\nAnother of the cases is being brought by Barry Rodger, a law professor at the University of Strathclyde, on behalf of more than 2,000 app developers who he argues are collectively entitled to up to £1bn in compensation.\n\n“Small and medium-sized app developer businesses have suffered as the result of excessive profiteering by the App Store and Google Play,” he said. His case alleges Google Play has charged “excessive, arbitrary and discriminatory commissions” against developers, with the makers of dating and games apps particularly affected.\n\nHis suit is expected to reach trial at the competitions appeal tribunal in October 2026, and will be jointly managed with a claim for about £1bn on behalf of 19 million Google Play customers, who are alleged to have been overcharged. That case is being brought by the consumer activist Liz Coll and accuses Google of “excluding competition and/or charging an unlawfully high level of commission on digital purchases”, breaching competition law.\n\nColl said: “These types of large collective proceedings are new in the UK, but I’m really excited about the potential of the Kent decision to not only make people aware they were paying too much for apps through opaque commission but also that there is now a clear route to getting that put right. Where we need consumers to get really active now is in claiming back the money they’re owed.”\n\nA Google spokesperson said: “Android provides more choice than any other platform and our fees are the lowest of any major app platform. We’ll defend these cases vigorously.”\n\nGoogle argues that the class action cases seek to upend a system that has lowered prices and increased choice and that, if successful, would make downloading and using apps on Android phones more complicated and less safe.\n\nAnd in the largest of all the claims, November saw the consumer campaign group Which? announce a £3bn claim against Apple over its iCloud services, claiming it is “trapping” customers with Apple devices into using it.\n\nApple called the Which? claims unfounded and said no customers are required to use iCloud. The company said it strongly disagrees with the ruling in Kent’s case over the App Store, and the tribunal took a flawed view of the “thriving and competitive app economy”, with other platforms providing “vigorous competition”. It said most apps are subject to a 15% commission, and the App Store helps drive the UK’s digital economy, facilitating billings and sales of over $55bn (£41bn) in the UK in 2024.\n\nKent said that people are “waking up to the harms of digital life and how it can be detrimental mentally, physically and financially”.\n\n“There is a tidal shift that is happening against big tech,” she said. “Consumers are looking at all of the tools that they have to use every day. Covid really accelerated our reliance on technology and many of us went from using five apps in a week to perhaps 10 apps in a day to manage food shopping, food delivery, retail, fitness and diet tracking, keeping in close communication with friends and family, much more social media, increased screen time.\n\n“A big part of the last six years working the case has been about educating people that this is actually happening. That’s what tech giants and marketeers like Apple are so brilliant at. It’s creating an ecosystem where we are foreclosed into decision making and we don’t even realise that this is actually how it’s happening.”",

    "fullText": "CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Men who were part of the group of Venezuelan migrants that the United States government transferred earlier this year to a prison in El Salvador demanded justice on Friday, days after a federal judge in Washington ruled that the Trump administration must give them legal due process.\n\nThe men told reporters in Venezuela’s capital that they hope legal organizations can push their claims in court. Their press conference was organized by Venezuela’s government, which had previously said it had retained legal services for the immigrants.\n\nOn Monday, a federal judge ordered the U.S. government to give legal due process to the 252 Venezuelan men, either by providing court hearings or returning them to the U.S. The ruling opens a path for the men to challenge the Trump administration’s allegation that they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang and subject to removal under an 18th century wartime law.\n\nThe men have repeatedly said they were physically and psychologically tortured while at the notorious Salvadoran prison.\n\n“Today, we are here to demand justice before the world for the human rights violations committed against each of us, and to ask for help from international organizations to assist us in our defense so that our human rights are respected and not violated again,” Andry Blanco told reporters in Caracas, where roughly two dozen of the migrants gathered Friday.\n\nSome of the men shared the daily struggles they now face — including fear of leaving their home or encountering law enforcement — as a consequence of what they said were brutal abuses while in prison. The men did not specify what justice should look like in their case, but not all are interested in returning to the U.S.\n\n“I don’t trust them,” Nolberto Aguilar said of the U.S. government.\n\nThe men were flown to El Salvador in March. They were sent to their home country in July as part of a prisoner swap between the Trump administration and the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nCamilla Fabri, Venezuelan vice minister of foreign affairs for international communications, said Maduro's government is working with a bar association in the U.S. and “all human rights organizations to prepare a major lawsuit against Trump and the United States government, so that they truly acknowledge all the crimes they have committed against” the men.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge this week canceled the trial of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported, and scheduled a hearing on whether the prosecution is being vindictive in pursuing a human smuggling case against him.\n\nAbrego Garcia has become a centerpiece of the debate over immigration after the Trump administration deported him in March to a notorious prison in El Salvador. Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee.\n\nAbrego Garcia has denied the allegations, and argued that prosecutors are vindictively and selectively targeting him. Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw, Jr. wrote in Tuesday’s order that Abrego Garcia had enough evidence to hold a hearing on the topic, which Crenshaw scheduled for Jan. 28.\n\nAt that hearing, prosecutors will have to explain their reasoning for charging Abrego Garcia, Crenshaw wrote, and if they fail in that, the charges could be dismissed.\n\nWhen Abrego Garcia was pulled over in 2022, there were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was eventually allowed to continue driving with only a warning.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security agent previously testified that he did not begin investigating the traffic stop until after the U.S. Supreme Court said in April that the Trump administration had to work to bring Abrego Garcia from El Salvador, where he was deported.\n\nYears earlier, Abrego Garcia had been granted protection from deportation to his home country after a judge found he faced danger there from a gang that targeted his family. That order allowed Abrego Garcia, who has an American wife and child, to live and work in the U.S. under Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervision.\n\nMembers of President Donald Trump’s administration have accused Abrego Garcia of being a member of the MS-13 gang, but he has vehemently denied the accusations and has no criminal record.\n\nAbrego Garcia's defense attorney and the U.S. attorney's office in Nashville did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
