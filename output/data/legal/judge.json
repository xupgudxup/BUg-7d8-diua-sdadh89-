    "fullText": "Judge says there is plenty of evidence to suggest OpenAI’s leaders made assurances nonprofit structure would be kept\n\nElon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI is to go to trial after a US judge said there is plenty of evidence to support the billionaire’s case.\n\nThe world’s richest man, who co-founded OpenAI, is suing the ChatGPT developer and its chief executive, Sam Altman, over claims its leaders violated the organisation’s founding mission by shifting to a for-profit model.\n\nThe US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, told a hearing there was plenty of evidence that suggested OpenAI’s leaders made assurances that its original nonprofit structure was going to be maintained.\n\nShe said there were enough disputed facts to let a jury consider the claims at a trial scheduled for March, rather than decide the issues herself. Rogers said she would issue a written order after the hearing that addresses OpenAI’s attempt to throw out the case.\n\nThe court dispute comes amid a broader showdown over dominance in the market for generative artificial intelligence. Musk’s xAI and its chatbot Grok are competing with OpenAI and other technology developers.\n\nMusk is seeking unspecified monetary damages from what he calls “ill-gotten gains” by OpenAI.\n\nIn a statement after the hearing, OpenAI said: “Mr Musk’s lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial.”\n\nMusk’s startup xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSteven Molo, a lead trial attorney for the billionaire and xAI, said after the hearing: “We look forward to presenting all the evidence of the defendants’ wrongdoing to the jury.”\n\nMusk contends he contributed about $38m (£28m), roughly 60% of OpenAI’s early funding, along with strategic guidance and credibility, based on assurances that the organisation would remain a nonprofit dedicated to the public benefit.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses OpenAI co-founders Altman and Greg Brockman of plotting a for-profit switch to enrich themselves, culminating in multibillion-dollar deals with Microsoft and a recent restructuring.\n\nOpenAI, Altman and Brockman have denied the claims, and have described Musk as “a frustrated commercial competitor seeking to slow down a mission-driven market leader”.\n\nMicrosoft, which is also a defendant, urged Rogers to throw out Musk’s claims against it. A lawyer for Microsoft said there was no evidence that the company “aided and abetted” OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft has been approached for comment.\n\nLawyers for OpenAI at the hearing asked Rogers to enter judgment against Musk, contending that he had not shown enough of a factual basis to sustain his allegations including fraud and breach of contract.\n\nOpenAI also contends that Musk failed to bring his allegations in a timely manner. The judge said the jury would be asked to weigh whether the lawsuit was filed outside the statute of limitations.",

    "description": "A separate judge ruled in November that Halligan, a Trump ally who prosecuted James Comey and Letitia James, had been unlawfully appointed to her position.",
    "fullText": "A federal judge Tuesday ordered Trump ally Lindsey Halligan to explain why she continues to call herself the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia even though another judge determined in November that she had been unlawfully appointed to the position.\n\nU.S. District Judge David Novak of Richmond issued a three-page order demanding to know why Halligan is still serving in the post. Halligan, who unsuccessfully prosecuted former FBI Direct James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, is also referred to as U.S. attorney by the Justice Department in official documents.\n\nThe judge's order is unusual because he issued it on his own, not at the request of defense attorneys. It came in a case involving a carjacking and attempted bank robbery suspect who was indicted last month.\n\nNovak gave Halligan seven days to respond in writing “explaining the basis for ... identification of herself as the United States Attorney, notwithstanding Judge Currie’s contrary ruling. She shall also set forth the reasons why this Court should not strike Ms. Halligan’s identification of herself as United States Attorney from the indictment in this matter.”\n\nThe judge’s order goes on to say Halligan \"shall further explain why her identification does not constitute a false or misleading statement.\" Novak also alluded to potential disciplinary action and demanded that Halligan sign her response.\n\nThe U.S. attorney’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.\n\nIn late November, U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie found that the Justice Department had violated the Constitution by appointing Halligan as U.S. attorney. That finding led to the dismissal of criminal cases against Comey and James.\n\nCurrie ruled that all actions “flowing from Ms. Halligan’s defective appointment, including securing and signing Mr. Comey’s indictment, were unlawful exercises of executive power.” She issued a separate, similar ruling in the James case, saying Halligan had exercised power she “did not lawfully possess.”\n\nNovak acknowledged Tuesday that the November ruling regarding Halligan’s appointment had been appealed but said that since the order had not been paused, it remains the “binding precedent of the district and is not subject to being ignored.”\n\nOther judges in the district have previously expressed their frustration with Halligan, including one who now places an asterisk next to Halligan’s name on every court document and next to it refers to Currie's ruling from November.\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

    "fullText": "It looks like Sam Altman and Elon Musk are headed for a courtroom showdown.\n\nDuring a hearing on Wednesday, a California judge said she plans to reject Altman's lawyers' last-ditch efforts to end Musk's case against OpenAI and its CEO.\n\n\"This case is going to trial,\" US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said at a hearing to consider whether the evidence was sufficient to warrant a jury trial.\n\n\"I think there's plenty of evidence,\" she said, referring to Musk's case. \"It's circumstantial, but that's how these things work.\"\n\nIn his lawsuit filed in 2024, Musk accused OpenAI of misleading him in its decision to abandon its original nonprofit mission and structure in favor of a profit-oriented model, including through its partnership with Microsoft.\n\nMusk says he donated $38 million to the maker of ChatGPT over the years to support its mission to develop AI for the benefit of humankind. The Tesla CEO is seeking monetary damages, as well as a judgment to void Microsoft's licensing agreement with OpenAI.\n\nAt a hearing on Wednesday, an Oakland federal court judge said she felt there was enough evidence that Musk may have been deceived to allow the case to move forward to a jury. A trial is scheduled for March.\n\n\"There were assurances made, and promises made, that the structure would be maintained,\" she said. \"There was lots of information that was not shared.\"\n\nThe judge added that she also felt \"there are strong arguments by the defense.\"\n\n\"I think the jury is going to get to decide,\" she said.\n\nOpenAI lawyers have denied Musk's allegations, saying Musk was aware of the company's for-profit plans as early as 2018. OpenAI has also pointed out that it is still controlled by OpenAI's nonprofit arm.\n\n\"Mr Musk's lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial,\" a spokesperson for OpenAI told Business Insider. \"We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best resourced nonprofits ever.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMusk has filed multiple lawsuits against OpenAI. Most recently, his AI company, xAI, sued OpenAI in September, accusing it of stealing trade secrets and targeting its employees for recruitment. At the time, an OpenAI spokesperson told Business that the lawsuit is \"the latest chapter in Mr. Musk's ongoing harassment.\"\n\nMusk helped found OpenAI in 2015, but left the company in 2018. At the time he said his work with OpenAI could present a conflict of interest with Tesla's AI ambitions.\n\nSince, Musk has repeatedly criticized Altman and OpenAI, including the company's structure. Musk later went on to launch his own AI company, xAI, in 2023.",

    "fullText": "Jan 6 (Reuters) - The 92-year-old judge overseeing the Nicolas Maduro case has said he displays a Hebrew scripture from the Torah on the wall of his Manhattan chambers: “Tzedek, tzedek tirdof” — “Justice, justice you shall pursue.\"\n\nAn Orthodox Jew who has been ​on the bench for almost three decades, U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein has been outspoken about how he tries to promote fairness ‌and the impact of his faith on his judicial philosophy.\n\nHellerstein opened the court hearing on Monday by saying he wants a fair trial for the ousted Venezuelan leader, who pleaded not ‌guilty on Monday to narco-terrorism charges.\n\n\"That's my job, and that's my intent,\" Hellerstein said.\n\nON THE SEVENTH DAY HE CONTEMPLATES\n\nHellerstein said in a 2020 podcast that he schedules sentencing hearings for Fridays, so that he can spend Shabbat — the Jewish sabbath from Friday sunset to Saturday nightfall — reflecting on whether the prison sentence he handed down was appropriate.\n\nHellerstein has ruled against President Donald Trump in recent years. He has also spoken up when he believes lawyers are not ⁠best serving their clients.\n\nIn a 2013 law review article, ‌he wrote that some lawyers were \"outraged\" and accused him of \"arrogation of power\" when he rejected a $675 million settlement negotiated between New York City and injured first responders who raced to the World Trade Center after the attacks of ‍September 11, 2001.\n\nHellerstein concluded that, while no statute or rule clearly addressed whether the deal needed his blessing, he had inherent authority to reject it as inadequate.\n\nThe attorneys ended up presenting Hellerstein with a new settlement that added $125 million for victims.\n\nHellerstein \"is a man of strongly held convictions and he seeks to find a way to harmonize ​the law with his understanding of justice,\" said Mitchell Epner, a former federal prosecutor who has observed Hellerstein on the bench.\n\nHellerstein has spoken ‌candidly about how his Jewish values affect his decision-making.\n\n\"As a judge, and as a Jew, I consider that everything I do reflects God and affects His image,\" he wrote in the 2013 article.\n\nIn the 2020 podcast, Hellerstein said he believes he was \"the first Orthodox boy employed by a gentile or Jewish firm in New York City.\"\n\n\"I'm pleased to say that after me there were others, and some credited me with having broken the precedent,\" Hellerstein said.\n\nHellerstein already had a long career before President Bill Clinton nominated him to the federal bench in 1998.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1960, Hellerstein served in the ⁠Judge Advocate General's Corps, the legal arm of the United States Army.\n\nIn 1960, Hellerstein ​joined the now-defunct firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, where he ended up practicing for much ​of his career.\n\nA HISTORY OF REBUKING TRUMP'S LEGAL GAMBITS\n\nIn a high-profile case in 2020, Hellerstein ordered the release of former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen, after Trump's Justice Department tried to revoke his home confinement and return him to jail.\n\nHellerstein ‍concluded Trump's administration was retaliating against Cohen ⁠for writing a book.\n\nIn 2023, Hellerstein denied a request by Trump to move to federal court his New York criminal case relating to a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Trump was tried in state court and found guilty of 34 felony ⁠counts.\n\nIn May 2025, Hellerstein rejected an effort by the Trump administration to use a wartime law to send alleged gang members to Venezuela, saying the men had been improperly denied ‌their day in court.\n\n“This is the United States of America,\" he said. \"People are being thrown out of the country because of ‌their tattoos.”",

The Daily Beast has reached out to the Supreme Court for comment.\n\nThe court’s favorability rating has plunged by 22 points over the past five years, from 70 percent in 2020 to a near-record low 48 percent late last year, the Pew Research Center reported in September.\n\nAnd although a vast majority of Americans, or 86 percent, think the justices should be non-partisan, 56 percent said the justices were doing only a fair or poor job of keeping their political views out of their legal decision-making.",

    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS (AP) — Nathan Chasing Horse, the former “Dances with Wolves” actor accused of sexual abuse, was temporarily thrown out of court Monday after he disrupted proceedings with demands he be allowed to fire his defense attorney a week before trial.\n\nJudge Jessica Peterson in Las Vegas ordered his jury trial to proceed next week as planned.\n\nChasing Horse has pleaded not guilty to 21 charges, including allegations that he sexually assaulted women and girls and that he filmed himself sexually abusing a girl younger than 14. Prosecutors allege he used his reputation as a spiritual leader and healer to take advantage of Native American women and girls over two decades.\n\nPeterson ordered him removed from court Monday for trying to speak over her. He argued that his attorney, Craig Mueller, did not come to visit him and did not file timely. He asked that a public defender who previously represented him be his attorney.\n\nMueller, a private defense attorney, told the court his client was ready and privately told the judge that one of his investigators had visited with Chasing Horse. He declined to comment to The Associated Press.\n\nBest known for portraying the character Smiles A Lot in the 1990 movie “Dances with Wolves,” Chasing Horse was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, which is home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.\n\nAfter starring in the Oscar-winning film, according to prosecutors, Chasing Horse began propping himself up as a self-proclaimed Lakota medicine man while traveling around North America to perform healing ceremonies. When he was arrested in 2023, he was living in a North Las Vegas house with his five wives, according to prosecutors.\n\nThe case sent shock waves across Indian Country. The original indictment was dismissed in 2024 after the Nevada Supreme Court ruled prosecutors abused the grand jury process when they provided a definition of grooming as evidence without any expert testimony. However, the court left open the possibility of charges being refiled, and a new indictment was brought later that year.\n\nProsecutors claim Chasing Horse led a cult called The Circle, and his followers believed he could speak with spirits. His victims went to him for medical help, according to a transcript from a grand jury hearing.\n\nProsecutors expect the trial to last three weeks. It is scheduled to begin Monday.",

    "fullText": "Embattled Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, who was convicted of obstruction last month for helping an immigrant evade federal officers, has sent her resignation letter to the governor.\n\nThe letter was sent Saturday. Republicans had been making plans to impeach her ever since her Dec. 19 conviction. A spokesperson for Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, said his office received Dugan's letter, and he would work to fill the vacancy without delay.\n\nDugan wrote that over the past decade she handled thousands of cases with “a commitment to treat all persons with dignity and respect, to act justly, deliberately and consistently, and to maintain a courtroom with the decorum and safety the public deserves.”\n\nBut she said the case against her is too big of a distraction.\n\n“As you know, I am the subject of unprecedented federal legal proceedings, which are far from concluded but which present immense and complex challenges that threaten the independence of our judiciary. I am pursuing this fight for myself and for our independent judiciary,” Dugan said in her letter.\n\nLast April, federal prosecutors accused Dugan of distracting federal officers trying to arrest a Mexican immigrant outside her courtroom and leading the man out through a private door. A federal jury convicted her of felony obstruction.\n\nThe case against Dugan was highlighted by President Donald Trump as he pressed ahead with his sweeping immigration crackdown. Democrats insisted the administration was trying to make an example of Dugan to blunt judicial opposition to the operation.\n\nRepublican Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos praised Dugan's decision.\n\n“I’m glad Dugan did the right thing by resigning and followed the clear direction from the Wisconsin Constitution,\" Vos said.\n\nDemocrat Ann Jacobs, who is chair of the Wisconsin Elections Commission board, said she agreed with Dugan that Milwaukee should have a permanent judge in place while this fight plays out.\n\n“Despite her situation, she is ever the champion of justice, wanting to remove the judiciary from a political battle over her fate. I’m sure this is terribly hard for her but she is true to her faith and her principles,” Jacobs said in a post on X.\n\nOn April 18, immigration officers went to the Milwaukee County courthouse after learning 31-year-old Eduardo Flores-Ruiz had reentered the country illegally and was scheduled to appear before Dugan for a hearing in a state battery case.\n\nDugan confronted agents outside her courtroom and directed them to the office of her boss, Milwaukee County Chief Judge Carl Ashley, because she told them their administrative warrant wasn’t sufficient grounds to arrest Flores-Ruiz.\n\nAfter the agents left, she led Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out a private jury door. Agents spotted Flores-Ruiz in the corridor, followed him outside and arrested him after a foot chase. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced in November he had been deported.",

The visit, which occurred on New Year’s Day on Thursday, even sparked speculation that the girl, reportedly named Kim Ju Ae and aged about 13, could be named a high-level official at the upcoming ruling Workers’ Party congress.  Images carried by North Korea’s state media on Friday showed Kim Ju Ae standing in the front row with her parents and deeply bowing at Pyongyang's Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang, where the embalmed bodies of her late grandfather and great-grandfather are on display.",
    "fullText": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The teenage daughter of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made her first known visit to a sacred family mausoleum, a step that experts say bolstered her status as her father's potential heir.\n\nThe visit, which occurred on New Year’s Day on Thursday, even sparked speculation that the girl, reportedly named Kim Ju Ae and aged about 13, could be named a high-level official at the upcoming ruling Workers’ Party congress.\n\nThe palace is “a place that symbolizes legitimacy of the North Korean regime” and her visit there ahead of the Workers' Party congress is a politically orchestrated move, said Cheong Seong-Chang, deputy head of the private Sejong Institute in South Korea.\n\nKim Jong Un, 41, is the third generation of his family to rule North Korea since the country's foundation in 1948. He often marks key state anniversaries by visiting the Kumsusan palace and paying respect to his father Kim Jong Il and grandfather Kim Il Sung.\n\nCheong predicted that Kim Jong Un could give his daughter the first secretary post at the Workers' Party, the party's No. 2 job, at the congress. Other experts say she is too young to accept such a high-profile post and might be provided with lower-level jobs.\n\nThe congress, the first of its kind in five years, is meant to establish new priorities in state policies and reshuffle officials. North Korea hasn't said when it will hold it, but the National Intelligence Service, South Korea's spy agency, said it likely will be held either in January or February.\n\nSince first appearing in state media in November 2022, Kim Ju Ae has accompanied her father at a slew of events including military parades and missile launches. In September, Kim Jong Un brought her on his trip to Beijing. During New Years' Day celebrations this week, she kissed her father on the cheek, showing their closeness.\n\nIn January 2024, the NIS said it viewed Kim Ju Ae as her father's likely heir. Some outside experts disagree with that assessment, citing Kim Jong Un’s relatively young age and the extremely male-dominated nature of North Korea’s power hierarchy. The NIS told lawmakers in November that Kim appeared to have no major health problems.\n\nRevealing the young Kim Ju Ae was a surprise to foreign experts because neither Kim Jong Un nor Kim Jong Il were mentioned in North Korean state media before they became adults. Some observers say Kim Jong Un likely aimed to shore up public support for his plan to extend the family's rule by repeatedly disclosing Kim Ju Ae in public events.",

    "fullText": "MLB.com | Brian Murphy: Tatsuya Imai, the top NPB player on the free agent market, is reportedly meeting with teams in Los Angeles ahead of his Friday afternoon deadline to sign. It’s unclear whether the Yankees are among those teams meeting in-person with Imai, though reports still link them, along with the Phillies and White Sox, to the right-hander. Imai, just 27-years-old, posted a 1.92 ERA over 163.2 innings in NPB last season, and may command a nine-figure guarantee.\n\nNew York Daily News | Peter Sblendorio: Now that the first quarter of the 21st century is in the books, the Daily News picked their All-Century New York team, selecting the best player from the last 25 years for each of New York’s teams. The top Yankee? None other than Aaron Judge. Judge had to beat out Derek Jeter, who won two World Series and racked up over 2,600 hits in the 2000’s, Alex Rodriguez, who won two MVP’s as a Yankee in the 21st century, and many other greats, but it’s clear that Judge’s resume has no peer. There are some debates with the other NY teams as well; Jalen Brunson, who’s played just 3.5 seasons in New York, is the Knicks’ All-Century selection, while Michael Strahan gets the nod over Eli Manning for the Giants.\n\nMLB.com | Sarah Langs: To close out 2025, the great Sarah Langs highlighted at least one amazing stat for each team from last season. For the Yankees, it of course came from Aaron Judge. Judge led MLB in batting average, OBP, and slugging percentage, the triple-slash triple crown, becoming just the fifth man in the expansion era to do so. He also set a record with 20 first-inning home runs.",

The plans by President Donald Trump’s administration are the latest in the saga over the Salvadoran citizen’s case that has become a lightning rod for both sides of the immigration debate as he fights to remain in the U.S.",
    "fullText": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — U.S. immigration officials do not plan to detain Kilmar Abrego Garcia again as long as a judge’s order banning it stands, according to a Tuesday court filing.\n\nThe plans by President Donald Trump’s administration are the latest in the saga over the Salvadoran citizen’s case that has become a lightning rod for both sides of the immigration debate as he fights to remain in the U.S. after a mistaken deportation to his home country, where he was imprisoned.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement did make clear they would detain Abrego Garcia if the order was lifted, Liana J. Castano, assistant director for field operations, wrote in the filing.\n\nTrump officials have accused Abrego Garcia of being a member of the MS-13 gang, but he has vehemently denied the accusations and has no criminal record. The administration brought him back to the U.S. in June under a court order, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paula Xinis earlier this month questioned whether government officials could be trusted to follow orders barring them from taking Abrego Garcia back into immigration custody or deporting him.\n\nA Justice Department push to indict\n\nEarlier Tuesday, a newly unsealed order in the criminal case against Abrego Garcia revealed that high-level Justice Department officials pushed for his indictment, calling it a “top priority,” only after he was mistakenly deported and then ordered returned to the U.S.\n\nAbrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty in federal court to the human smuggling charges. He is seeking to have the case dismissed on the grounds that the prosecution is vindictive, arguing the Trump administration is targeting him as punishment for the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation.\n\nTo support that argument, he has asked the government to turn over documents that reveal how the decision was made to prosecute him in 2025 for an incident that occurred in 2022.\n\nAbrego Garcia had recently been in immigration custody for three months before Xinis ordered his release on Dec. 11. In that time, the government said it planned to deport him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Liberia.\n\nIn her Dec. 11 order, Xinis found that immigration officials had no viable plan to remove Abrego Garcia from the U.S. and said he could not be held indefinitely. She issued a separate order barring ICE from re-detaining him, at least for the time being. After a hearing on the issue, Xinis ordered the government to file the brief they released Tuesday outlining whether they planned to detain Abrego Garcia again.\n\nAbrego Garcia's human smuggling case stems from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee where he was pulled over for speeding with nine passengers in the car. State troopers discussed the possibility of human smuggling among themselves. However, he was ultimately allowed to leave with only a warning. The case was turned over to Homeland Security Investigations, but there is no record of any effort to charge him until April 2025, according to court records.\n\nThe newly unsealed Dec. 3 order from U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw compelled the government to provide some documents to Abrego Garcia and his attorneys, although it does not give a lot of detail on their contents.\n\nClaims of a ‘vindictive’ prosecution\n\nEarlier, Crenshaw found that there was “some evidence” that the prosecution of Abrego Garcia could be vindictive. He specifically cited a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on a Fox News program that seemed to suggest that the Department of Justice charged Abrego Garcia because he had won his wrongful deportation case.\n\nRob McGuire, who was the Acting U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee until late December, argued that those statements were irrelevant because he alone made the decision to prosecute, and he has no animus against Abrego Garcia.\n\nIn the unsealed order, Crenshaw writes, “Some of the documents suggest not only that McGuire was not a solitary decision-maker, but he in fact reported to others in DOJ and the decision to prosecute Abrego may have been a joint decision.”\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee released a statement saying: “The emails cited in Judge Crenshaw’s order, specifically Mr. McGuire’s email on May 15, 2025, confirm that the ultimate decision on whether to prosecute was made by career prosecutors based on the facts, evidence, and established DOJ practice. Communications with the Deputy Attorney General’s Office about a high-profile case are both required and routine.”\n\nThe email referenced was from McGuire to his staff saying Blanche “would like Garcia charged sooner rather than later,” according to Crenshaw's order.\n\nThe order also shows that Aakash Singh, who works under Blanche in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, contacted McGuire about Abrego Garcia's case on April 27, the same day that McGuire received a file on the case from Homeland Security Investigations. That was several days after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Abrego Garcia's favor on April 10.\n\nOn April 30, Singh said in an email to McGuire that the prosecution was a “top priority” for the Deputy Attorney General's Office, according to the order. Singh and McGuire continued to communicate about the prosecution. On May 18, Singh wrote to McGuire and others to hold the draft indictment until they got “clearance” to file it. “The implication is that ‘clearance’ would come from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General,” Crenshaw writes.\n\nA hearing on the motion to dismiss the human smuggling case on the basis of vindictive prosecution is scheduled for Jan. 28.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — The White House cannot lapse in its funding of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal district court judge ruled on Tuesday, only days before funds at the bureau would have likely run out and the consumer finance agency would have no money to pay its employees.\n\nJudge Amy Berman ruled that the CFPB should continue to get its funds from the Federal Reserve, despite the Fed operating at a loss, and that the White House's new legal argument about how the CFPB gets its funds is not valid.\n\nAt the heart of this case is whether Russell Vought, President Donald Trump's budget director and the acting director of the CFPB, can effectively shut down the agency and lay off all of the bureau's employees. The CFPB has largely been inoperable since President Trump has sworn into office nearly a year ago. Its employees are mostly forbidden from doing any work, and most of the bureau's operations this year has been to unwind the work it did under President Biden and even under Trump's first term.\n\nVought himself has made comments where he has made it clear that his intention is to effectively shut down the CFPB. The White House earlier this year issued a “reduction in force” for the CFPB, which would have furloughed or laid off much of the bureau.\n\nThe National Treasury Employees Union, which represents the workers at the CFPB, has been mostly successful in court to stop the mass layoffs and furloughs. The union sued Vought earlier this year and won a preliminary injunction stopping the layoffs while the union's case continues through the legal process.\n\nIn recent weeks, the White House has used a new line of argument to potentially get around the court's injunction. The argument is that the Federal Reserve has no “combined earnings” at the moment to fund the CFPB’s operations. The CFPB gets its funding from the Fed through expected quarterly payments.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been operating at a paper loss since 2022 as a result of the central bank trying to combat inflation, the first time in the Fed's entire history its been operating at a loss. The Fed holds bonds on its balance sheet from a period of low interest rates during the COVID-19 pandemic, but currently has to pay out higher interest rates to banks who hold their deposits at the central bank. The Fed has been recording a “deferred asset” on its balance sheet which it expects will be paid down in the next few years as the low interest bonds mature off the Fed's balance sheet.\n\nBecause of this loss on paper, the White House has argued there are no “combined earnings” for the CFPB to draw on. The CFPB has operated since 2011, including under President Trump’s first term, drawing on the Fed’s operating budget.\n\nWhite House lawyers sent a notice to the court in early November, where they argued that the CFPB would run out of appropriations in early 2026, using the “combined earnings” argument, and does not expect to get any additional appropriations from Congress.\n\nThis combined earnings legal argument is not entirely new. It has floated in conservative legal circles going back to when the Federal Reserve started operating at a loss. The Office of Legal Counsel, which acts as the government's legal advisors, adopted this legal theory in a memo on November 7. However, this idea has never been tested in court.\n\nIn her opinion, Berman said the OLC and Vought were using this legal theory to get around the court's injunction instead of allowing the case to be decided on merits. A trial on whether the CFPB employees' union can sue Vought over the layoffs is currently scheduled for February 2026.\n\n“It appears that defendants’ new understanding of “combined earnings” is an unsupported and transparent attempt to starve the CPFB of funding and yet another attempt to achieve the very end the Court’s injunction was put in place to prevent,\" Berman wrote in an opinion.\n\n“We’re very pleased that the court made clear what should have been obvious: Vought can’t justify abandoning the agency’s obligations or violating a court order by manufacturing a lack of funding,” said Jennifer Bennett of Gupta Wessler LLP, who is representing the CFPB employees in the case.\n\nA White House spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Berman's opinion.",

    "fullText": "MIAMI (AP) — U.S. Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick reiterated her innocence Monday outside a Miami federal courthouse, where she faces charges of conspiring to steal $5 million in federal COVID-19 disaster funds.\n\nCherfilus-McCormick was scheduled to be arraigned, but her attorney requested the proceeding be rescheduled to Jan. 20 so that she could finalize her legal team. Prosecutors didn't object, and Judge Lisette Reid agreed to the new date. The hearing lasted less than five minutes.\n\n“I just want to make it very clear that I am innocent,” Cherfilus-McCormick said immediately after leaving court. “In no way did I steal any kind of funds. I'm committed to the people of Florida and my district.”\n\nCherfilus-McCormick, a Democrat, has pleaded not guilty. She is facing 15 federal counts that accuse her of stealing funds that had been overpaid to her family's health care company, Trinity Healthcare Services, in 2021. The company had a contract to register people for COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\nCherfilus-McCormick's attorney, David Oscar Markus, said the case involves mistakes that generally aren't even misdemeanors, let alone felonies. He said he believes the case is politically motivated.\n\nCherfilus-McCormick was arrested in November and then freed on a $60,000 bond. In addition to bail, the judge said Cherfilus-McCormick must surrender her personal passport, and is allowed to travel only between Florida, Washington, D.C., Maryland and the Eastern District of Virginia.\n\nShe has been allowed to retain her congressional passport so she can perform certain duties for her job.\n\nAccording to the federal indictment, prosecutors said that within two months of receiving the funds in 2021, more than $100,000 had been spent on a 3-carat yellow diamond ring for the congresswoman.\n\nThe health care company owned by Cherfilus-McCormick's family had received payments through a COVID-19 vaccination staffing contract, the indictment said. Her brother, Edwin Cherfilus, requested $50,000, but they mistakenly received $5 million and didn't return the difference.\n\nProsecutors said the funds received by Trinity Healthcare were distributed to various accounts, including to friends and relatives who then donated to Cherfilus-McCormick's campaign for Congress.\n\nCherfilus-McCormick won a special election in January 2022 to represent Florida’s 20th District, which includes parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, after Rep. Alcee Hastings died in 2021.\n\nThe charges she faces include theft of government funds; making and receiving straw donor contributions; aiding and assisting a false and fraudulent statement on a tax return; money laundering, as well as conspiracy charges associated with each of those counts.\n\nAccording to a previous statement provided by Cherfilus-McCormick's chief of staff, she doesn't plan to resign from office. She said she has cooperated with “every lawful request” and will continue to do so until the matter is resolved.",

(AP) — A Georgia judge on Monday ordered a temporary pause to a December execution that was already put on hold, saying questions about the state's clemency process must be addressed before Stacey Humphreys ' death sentence could be carried out.\n\nHumphreys, 52, was facing scheduled execution Dec. 17 but the procedure was paused just days before he was to have received a lethal injection.\n\nHe was convicted of malice murder and other crimes in the 2003 shooting deaths of Cyndi Williams, 33, and Lori Brown, 21, at the real estate office where they worked in Cobb County, northwest of Atlanta.\n\nAt issue: Humphreys' lawyers contend that two members of Georgia's parole board have conflicts of interest which would taint their participation in a clemency hearing.\n\nHumphreys’ lawyers earlier this month filed a petition asking a judge to order the two members of the parole board to recuse themselves from considering his clemency petition.\n\nThe lawyers said one of those board members, Kimberly McCoy, was previously a victim advocate with the Cobb County district attorney’s office at the time of Humphreys’ trial and was assigned to work with victims in the case.\n\nAnother board member, Wayne Bennett, was the sheriff in Glynn County, where the trial was moved because of pretrial publicity. Humphreys’ lawyers say Bennett oversaw security for the jurors and Humphreys himself during the case.\n\nIn an order filed Monday, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney wrote that “pressing ‘pause’ on the execution machinery until we answer the non-frivolous question raised by Petitioner concerning the proper composition of the Board for his clemency hearing is the correct course of action.”\n\nHe ordered lawyers for both sides to file additional legal briefs on the issue by Jan. 19.\n\nAdditionally, the judge wrote in his order that Humphreys deserves to have the conflict of interest question researched and argued thoroughly so that a parole board free of conflicts of interest can decide his case at a clemency hearing.",

    "fullText": "If appeal fails, every person in UK who made App Store purchases between 2015 and 2024 could be entitled to compensation\n\nApple is seeking to overturn a landmark £1.5bn court ruling on behalf of millions of UK customers, which found the company overcharged them for years in its App Store.\n\nThe iPhone maker has applied to the court of appeal to challenge a verdict that campaigners heralded as the start of a “tidal shift against big tech”.\n\nIt is one of a cluster of cases heading towards trial in 2026 as consumers realise the mounting cost of paying up to 30% commission – what campaigners call the “Apple tax” – on apps and in-app purchases, which more people rely on for activities from fitness to dating.\n\nThe appeal, if allowed, involves one of several class action suits against Apple and Google in which consumers, small businesses and entrepreneurs are demanding over £6bn in combined compensation. The class action cases use an opt-out system that means millions of people can be represented at once in claims of breaches of competition law.\n\n“It’s definitely a tipping point,” said Dr Rachael Kent, an academic at King’s College London who won the £1.5bn case against Apple on behalf of 36 million UK consumers. “People are pushing back against the harms from digital worlds, which they have to be living in and through every day and the financial implications of that,” she said.\n\nKent added that the win in October still felt “a bit pinch me”. If Apple’s appeal fails, every person in the UK who made App Store purchases between 2015 and 2024 could be entitled to a payout.\n\nIn the suite of class action cases, Apple and Google are accused of overcharging British consumers and developers in their app stores and, in the case of Apple, of “trapping” and overcharging customers with its iCloud data storage service.\n\nInstead of up to 30%, Apple should be charging commission of 17.5% when selling apps and 10% on in-app purchases, while app developers should pay 10%, the competition appeal tribunal found in Kent’s case.\n\nAnother of the cases is being brought by Barry Rodger, a law professor at the University of Strathclyde, on behalf of more than 2,000 app developers who he argues are collectively entitled to up to £1bn in compensation.\n\n“Small and medium-sized app developer businesses have suffered as the result of excessive profiteering by the App Store and Google Play,” he said. His case alleges Google Play has charged “excessive, arbitrary and discriminatory commissions” against developers, with the makers of dating and games apps particularly affected.\n\nHis suit is expected to reach trial at the competitions appeal tribunal in October 2026, and will be jointly managed with a claim for about £1bn on behalf of 19 million Google Play customers, who are alleged to have been overcharged. That case is being brought by the consumer activist Liz Coll and accuses Google of “excluding competition and/or charging an unlawfully high level of commission on digital purchases”, breaching competition law.\n\nColl said: “These types of large collective proceedings are new in the UK, but I’m really excited about the potential of the Kent decision to not only make people aware they were paying too much for apps through opaque commission but also that there is now a clear route to getting that put right. Where we need consumers to get really active now is in claiming back the money they’re owed.”\n\nA Google spokesperson said: “Android provides more choice than any other platform and our fees are the lowest of any major app platform. We’ll defend these cases vigorously.”\n\nGoogle argues that the class action cases seek to upend a system that has lowered prices and increased choice and that, if successful, would make downloading and using apps on Android phones more complicated and less safe.\n\nAnd in the largest of all the claims, November saw the consumer campaign group Which? announce a £3bn claim against Apple over its iCloud services, claiming it is “trapping” customers with Apple devices into using it.\n\nApple called the Which? claims unfounded and said no customers are required to use iCloud. The company said it strongly disagrees with the ruling in Kent’s case over the App Store, and the tribunal took a flawed view of the “thriving and competitive app economy”, with other platforms providing “vigorous competition”. It said most apps are subject to a 15% commission, and the App Store helps drive the UK’s digital economy, facilitating billings and sales of over $55bn (£41bn) in the UK in 2024.\n\nKent said that people are “waking up to the harms of digital life and how it can be detrimental mentally, physically and financially”.\n\n“There is a tidal shift that is happening against big tech,” she said. “Consumers are looking at all of the tools that they have to use every day. Covid really accelerated our reliance on technology and many of us went from using five apps in a week to perhaps 10 apps in a day to manage food shopping, food delivery, retail, fitness and diet tracking, keeping in close communication with friends and family, much more social media, increased screen time.\n\n“A big part of the last six years working the case has been about educating people that this is actually happening. That’s what tech giants and marketeers like Apple are so brilliant at. It’s creating an ecosystem where we are foreclosed into decision making and we don’t even realise that this is actually how it’s happening.”",

The men did not specify what justice should look like in their case, but not all are interested in returning to the U.S.\n\n“I don’t trust them,” Nolberto Aguilar said of the U.S. government.\n\nThe men were flown to El Salvador in March. They were sent to their home country in July as part of a prisoner swap between the Trump administration and the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nCamilla Fabri, Venezuelan vice minister of foreign affairs for international communications, said Maduro's government is working with a bar association in the U.S. and “all human rights organizations to prepare a major lawsuit against Trump and the United States government, so that they truly acknowledge all the crimes they have committed against” the men.",

Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee.\n\nAbrego Garcia has denied the allegations, and argued that prosecutors are vindictively and selectively targeting him. Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw, Jr. wrote in Tuesday’s order that Abrego Garcia had enough evidence to hold a hearing on the topic, which Crenshaw scheduled for Jan. 28.\n\nAt that hearing, prosecutors will have to explain their reasoning for charging Abrego Garcia, Crenshaw wrote, and if they fail in that, the charges could be dismissed.\n\nWhen Abrego Garcia was pulled over in 2022, there were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was eventually allowed to continue driving with only a warning.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security agent previously testified that he did not begin investigating the traffic stop until after the U.S. Supreme Court said in April that the Trump administration had to work to bring Abrego Garcia from El Salvador, where he was deported.\n\nYears earlier, Abrego Garcia had been granted protection from deportation to his home country after a judge found he faced danger there from a gang that targeted his family. That order allowed Abrego Garcia, who has an American wife and child, to live and work in the U.S. under Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervision.\n\nMembers of President Donald Trump’s administration have accused Abrego Garcia of being a member of the MS-13 gang, but he has vehemently denied the accusations and has no criminal record.\n\nAbrego Garcia's defense attorney and the U.S. attorney's office in Nashville did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Days after Ghislaine Maxwell asked a judge to immediately free her from a 20-year prison sentence, the public release of grand jury transcripts from her sex trafficking case returned the spotlight to victims whose allegations helped land her behind bars.\n\nThe disclosure of the transcripts as part of the Justice Department’s ongoing release of its investigative files on Maxwell and the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein exposed how an FBI agent told grand jurors about Maxwell's critical role in Epstein’s decades-long sexual abuse of girls and young women.\n\nMaxwell, a British socialite and publishing heir, was convicted of sex trafficking in December 2021 after four women told a federal jury in New York City about how she and Epstein abused them in the 1990s and early 2000s. Epstein never went to trial. He was arrested in July 2019 on sex trafficking charges and killed himself a month later in his cell at a Manhattan federal jail.\n\nTwo weeks ago, as the Justice Department prepared to begin releasing what are commonly known as the Epstein files, Maxwell filed a habeas petition, asking a federal judge to free her on grounds that “substantial new evidence” has emerged proving that constitutional violations spoiled her trial.\n\nMaxwell claimed exonerating information was withheld and that witnesses lied in their testimony. She filed the petition on her own, without the assistance of a lawyer.\n\nThis week, the judge, Paul A. Engelmayer, scolded Maxwell for failing to remove victim names and other identifying information from her court papers. He said future filings must be kept sealed and out of public view until they have been reviewed and redacted to protect victims' identities.\n\nVictims fear Maxwell will be pardoned\n\nEpstein accuser Danielle Bensky said the release of records has only sharpened the focus on Maxwell’s crimes among their victims. Bensky said she's been involved in daily discussions with about two dozen other victims that make clear Maxwell “is a criminal who was 1,000% engaged in sexual acts.\"\n\n“I’ve heard things that would make your blood curdle. I just had a conversation with a survivor last night who said she was the puppeteer,” Bensky said.\n\nBensky said she was sexually abused by Epstein two decades ago. She said she was never personally abused by Maxwell.\n\nDelayed and heavily redacted files\n\nThe transcripts of grand jury proceedings that resulted in Maxwell's indictment were released this week in accordance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a law enacted last month after months of public and political pressure.\n\nThe Justice Department has been periodically posting records after acknowledging it would miss last Friday’s congressionally mandated deadline to release all records. It blamed the delay on the time-consuming process of obscuring victims’ names and other identifying information.\n\nOn Wednesday, the department said it may need a “few more weeks” to release the full trove after suddenly discovering more than a million potentially relevant documents. It was a stunning development after department officials suggested months ago that they'd already accounted for the vast universe of Epstein-related materials.\n\nSome of the Epstein and Maxwell grand jury records were initially released with heavy redactions — A 119-page document marked “Grand Jury-NY” — was entirely blacked out. Updated versions were posted over the weekend.\n\nFBI agent testifies Maxwell manipulated young girl\n\nAn FBI agent’s grand jury testimony, describing interviews conducted with Epstein victims, foreshadowed trial testimony a year later from four women who described Maxwell's role in their sexual abuse from 1994 to 2004.\n\nThe agent told of a woman who described meeting Maxwell and Epstein as a 14-year-old attending a Michigan summer arts camp in 1994. Flight logs showed Epstein and Maxwell went to the school sponsoring the camp because Epstein was a donor.\n\nAccording to the agent, whose name was redacted from the transcript, the girl had a chance encounter with Epstein and Maxwell one day. After learning that the girl was from Palm Beach, Florida, Epstein mentioned that he sometimes gave scholarships to students and they requested her phone number, the agent said.\n\nOnce home, the girl visited Epstein's estate with her mother for tea and the mother was impressed when Epstein said he provided scholarships, enough so that the mother said Epstein was like a “godfather,” the agent said.\n\nThe agent said the girl began regularly going to the estate as Epstein and Maxwell “groomed” her with gifts and trips to the movies, and Epstein began paying for voice lessons and giving her money that he said she should give to her struggling mother.\n\nThe agent said the girl thought her relationship with Epstein and Maxwell was strange, “but Maxwell normalized it for her. She was like a cool, older sister and made comments like, ‘This is what grownups do.’”\n\nEventually, the agent testified, the girl saw Maxwell topless at the pool. After she revealed that she hoped to be an actor and a model, Epstein told her he was best friends with the owner of Victoria's Secret and that she'll have to learn to be comfortable in her underwear and not be a prude, the agent said.\n\nThen, the agent said, the girl asked Epstein what he meant by that and the financier pulled her into his lap and masturbated. After that, the agent added, the girl's encounters with Epstein began to include sexual contact, particularly in his massage room.\n\nMaxwell was sometimes there with other girls, the agent said. One of the girls would begin massaging Epstein and Maxwell would tease the girls, the agent said.\n\n“She’d grab the girl’s breasts, and she would direct the girls on what to do,” the agent said, relaying the girl’s account. Maxwell's attitude during the encounters was ”very casual; she acted like this was normal,\" the agent said.\n\nThe released testimony appeared to reflect the testimony at Maxwell's 2021 trial by a woman who testified under the pseudonym “Jane.”\n\nAt trial, Jane said Maxwell also participated in group sessions between multiple females and Epstein that usually began with Epstein or Maxwell leading them all into a bedroom or a massage room at the Palm Beach residence.",

    "description": "A federal judge gave a green light Tuesday to New York’s so-called Green Light Law, rejecting the Trump administration’s bid to stop the state from giving people driver's licenses without having them prove they are in the country legally.  U.S. District Judge Anne M.

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge gave a green light Tuesday to New York’s so-called Green Light Law, rejecting the Trump administration’s bid to stop the state from giving people driver's licenses without having them prove they are in the country legally.\n\nU.S. District Judge Anne M. Nardacci in Albany ruled that the Republican administration — which challenged the law under President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration — had failed to support its claims that the state law usurps federal law or that it unlawfully regulates or unlawfully discriminates against the federal government.\n\nThe Justice Department sued the state over the law in February, naming Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state’s attorney general, Letitia James, as defendants. At a news conference announcing the lawsuit, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi accused the officials, both Democrats, of prioritizing “illegal aliens over American citizens.”\n\n“As I said from the start, our laws protect the rights of all New Yorkers and keep our communities safe,” James said in a statement Friday. “I will always stand up for New Yorkers and the rule of law.”\n\nA message seeking comment was left for the Justice Department.\n\nNardacci, appointed to the bench by President Joe Biden, a Democrat, wrote that her job was not to evaluate the desirability of the Green Light Law as a policy matter. Rather, she said in a 23-page opinion, it was to assess whether the Trump administration’s arguments established that the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, which gives federal laws precedence over state laws.\n\nThe administration, she wrote, has “failed to state such a claim.”\n\nThe Green Light Law was enacted partly to improve public safety on the roads, as people without licenses sometimes drove without one, or without having passed a road test. The state also makes it easier for holders of such licenses to get auto insurance, thus cutting down on crashes involving uninsured drivers.\n\nUnder the law, people who don’t have a valid Social Security number can submit alternative forms of ID that include valid passports and driver’s licenses issued in other countries. Applicants must still get a permit and pass a road test to qualify for a “standard driver’s license.” It does not apply to commercial driver’s licenses.\n\nThe Justice Department’s lawsuit sought to strike down the law as “a frontal assault on the federal immigration laws, and the federal authorities that administer them.” It highlighted a provision that requires the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles commissioner to inform people who are in the country illegally when a federal immigration agency has requested their information.\n\nIn 2020, during Trump’s first term, his administration sought to pressure New York into changing the law by barring anyone from the state from enrolling in trusted traveler programs, meaning they would spend longer amounts of time going through security lines at airports.\n\nThe governor at the time, Andrew Cuomo, offered to restore federal access to driving records on a limited basis, but said he wouldn’t let immigration agents see lists of people who had applied for the special licenses available to immigrants who couldn’t prove legal residency in the U.S. The administration ultimately restored New Yorkers’ access to the trusted traveler program after a brief legal fight.\n\nIn the lawsuit rejected Tuesday, the administration argued that it could be easier to enforce federal immigration priorities if federal authorities had unfettered access to New York’s driver information. Nardacci, echoing a 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in a county clerk’s earlier challenge to the law, wrote that such information “remains available to federal immigration authorities” through a lawful court order or judicial warrant.",

    "fullText": "On 23 December 2025, Judge Leal granted a motion brought by Vizio that sought a ruling on a position that SFC has not actually taken.\r\nVizio asked the court to rule on something that no one\r\n believes the GPLv2 requires.\n\nSpecifically, Vizio said in their\r\n motion for summary adjudication:\r\nDefendant VIZIO, Inc. [moves] this Court for summary adjudication [re] whether … GPLv2 … and … LGPLv2.1 … require the licensee [under the GPL Agreements] to\r\nprovide information necessary to install modified versions of the licensed\r\nsoftware back onto the Smart TVs with which the software was originally\r\ndistributed while ensuring the TVs continue to function properly. …\r\nVIZIO moves on the grounds that the plain language … compels the\r\nconclusion that neither license imposes a duty on licensees to provide all\r\ninformation necessary to permit reinstallation of modified software back\r\n on the same device such that the device continues to function properly.\n\nSFC has never held the position, nor do we today hold the position, that\r\n any version of the GPL (even including GPLv3!) require “that the\r\n device continues to function properly” after a user installs their\r\n modified version of the copyleft components.\n\nIndeed, as was seen with TiVo, it is\r\n completely sufficient to provide the user a mechanism to install a new\r\n firmware that removes not only all proprietary components (such\r\n as Vizio's (or TiVo's) TV application), but also other material that is a “independent and separate work” from the copylefted software. (This may include, for example, removing keys used to\r\n decode encrypted video content with the underlying hardware.) The GPL Agreements\r\n promise the users' right to a functioning Linux-based system with any other copylefted\r\n components.\n\nUnfortunately, Vizio's motion is likely\r\n to confuse the public. No reasonable consumer or copyleft activist has ever\r\n asked for this, nor expects it. GPLv3 itself even allows (under certain conditions) for the\r\n OEM vendor to cause the accompanying user-space proprietary\r\n software to cease to function. We frankly don't know where Vizio got the language for their motion.\n\nFor years, we have asked Vizio to for the complete, corresponding source\r\n code for all GPL'd and LGPL'd components on their devices so we can keep\r\n these devices out of landfills, repurpose them for new applications,\r\n and otherwise exercise our software right to repair as consumers. We (and all consumers)\r\n have expected to happen with every piece of hardware that we all\r\n have purchased since the inception of copylefted operating systems. Vizio's position here is even what we\r\n would expect with a laptop: if we buy a Microsoft Windows laptop and\r\n install a Linux-based system, we wouldn't expect the Microsoft Word application to necessarily\r\n continue working (Microsoft's software might work with Wine, but\r\n the laptop vendor wouldn't guarantee that.) Similarly, we don't expect\r\n Vizio's proprietary TV software to function when we exercise our right to\r\n software repair.\n\nLitigation is complicated and nuanced decisions by the Court are often\r\n exaggerated by third parties with a political and/or policy agenda. We will continue to advocate, in this case and elsewhere, that users and consumers are owed the installation scripts that were used to install the GPLv2'd and LGPLv2.1'd software. We do expect those who favor corporate profit over users' rights to publicly claim this ruling reaches further and means more than it says.\n\nWe still await the judge's decision on our own motion for summary adjudication. We will continue to provide nuanced and realistic information about our best understanding of this historic case and our future work to come.\n\nWe look forward to the\r\n Vizio trial where we will argue that our (and the FSF's) interpretation of the\r\n copyleft licenses is correct, accurate, and assures the software right to\r\n repair. Join us in Santa Ana next month to watch the truth unfold.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a March presidential memorandum to revoke the security clearance of prominent Washington attorney Mark Zaid, ruling that the order — which also targeted 14 other individuals — could not be applied to him.\n\nThe decision marked the administration’s second legal setback on Tuesday, after the Supreme Court declined to allow Trump to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area, capping a first year in office in which President Donald Trump’s efforts to impose a sweeping agenda and pursue retribution against political adversaries have been repeatedly slowed by the courts.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amir Ali in Washington granted Zaid's request for a preliminary injunction, after he sued the Trump administration in May over the revocation of his security clearance. Zaid's request called it an act of “improper political retribution” that jeopardized his ability to continue representing clients in sensitive national security cases.\n\nThe March presidential memorandum singled out Zaid and 14 other individuals who the White House asserted were unsuitable to retain their clearances because it was “no longer in the national interest.” The list included targets of Trump’s fury from both the political and legal spheres, including former Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, New York Attorney General Letitia James, former President Joe Biden and members of his family.\n\nThe action was part of a much broader retribution campaign that Trump has waged since returning to the White House, including directing specific Justice Department investigations against perceived adversaries and issuing sweeping executive orders targeting law firms over legal work he does not like.\n\nIn August, the Trump administration said it was revoking the security clearances of 37 current and former national security officials. Ordering the revocation of clearances has been a favored retributive tactic that Trump has wielded — or at least tried to — against high-profile political figures, lawyers and intelligence officials in his second term.\n\nZaid said in his lawsuit that he has represented clients across the political spectrum over nearly 35 years, including government officials, law enforcement and military officials and whistleblowers. In 2019, he represented an intelligence community whistleblower whose account of a conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy helped set the stage for the first of two impeachment cases against Trump in his first term.\n\n\"This court joins the several others in this district that have enjoined the government from using the summary revocation of security clearances to penalize lawyers for representing people adverse to it,\" Ali wrote in his order.\n\nAli emphasized that his order does not prevent the government from revoking or suspending Zaid’s clearance for reasons independent of the presidential memorandum and through normal agency processes. The preliminary injunction does not go into effect until January 13.\n\nZaid said in a statement, “This is not just a victory for me, it’s an indictment of the Trump administration’s attempts to intimidate and silence the legal community, especially lawyers who represent people who dare to question or hold this government accountable.\"",

    "fullText": "A federal judge upheld the Trump administration's ability to place a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications.\n\nUS District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington, DC, said in the opinion that President Donald Trump's order made on September 19 to hike visa fees \"rests on a straightforward reading of congressional statutes giving the President broad authority to regulate entry into the United States for immigrants and nonimmigrants alike.\"\n\n\"Here, Congress has decided to delegate broad power to the President to restrict entry of noncitizens '[w]henever the President finds that\" such entry 'would be detrimental to the interests of the United States,'\" wrote Howell.\n\n\"To be clear, this decision in favor of defendants is not to dismiss or discount the past and ongoing contributions of H-1B workers to the American economy that plaintiffs highlight,\" Howell added. \"The effects of the H-1B program on the American economy or national security, whether positive or negative, are simply not at issue in this case.\"\n\nThe US Chamber of Commerce and Association of American Universities, which challenged the policy in court, can appeal the decision.\n\nIn the initial court filing asking for an immediate injunction on the visa fee hike, the plaintiffs argued that presidential powers do not sweep so far as to permit the president to \"rewrite a visa program by imposing an unprecedented fee on domestic employers, and purporting to deny entry only when those domestic employers are unable or unwilling to pay.\"\n\nTrump's presidential proclamation in September, said to prevent system \"abuses\" and to encourage companies to train American workers, sent major tech companies scrambling as they raced to decipher the new rules.\n\nThe Trump administration later clarified that the fee hike only applies to new visas.\n\nH-1B visas have become a mainstay of the tech industry, enabling companies to hire highly skilled workers.",

All three girls were 12 years old at the time.\n\nGeyser and Weier later told investigators they attacked Leutner in hopes of impressing Slender Man enough that he would make them his servants and wouldn't hurt their families. Both of them were eventually committed to the Winnebago Mental Health Institute — Geyser for 40 years and Weier for 25 years.\n\nWeier earned conditional release in 2021. Wagner granted Geyser conditional release this past September despite warnings from state Department of Health Services officials that she couldn't be trusted.\n\nGeyser was placed in a Madison group home. Authorities say that on Nov. 22 she cut off her GPS monitor and fled the state with a 43-year-old companion. Police arrested both of them the next day at a truck stop outside Chicago, about 170 miles (274 kilometers) south of Madison.\n\nGeyser's companion told WKOW-TV that the two of them became friends at church and had been seeing each other daily for the last month. Geyser decided to escape because she was afraid the group home would no longer allow them to see each other, the companion said.\n\nSlender Man was created online by Eric Knudsen in 2009 as a mysterious figure photo-edited into everyday images of children at play. He grew into a popular boogeyman, appearing in video games, online stories and a 2018 movie.",

    "fullText": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to reallocate federal Homeland Security funding away from states that refuse to cooperate with certain federal immigration enforcement.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mary McElroy's ruling on Monday solidified a win for the coalition of 12 attorneys general that sued the administration earlier this year after being alerted that their states would receive drastically reduced federal grants due to their “sanctuary” jurisdictions.\n\nIn total, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency reduced more than $233 million from Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. The money is part of a $1 billion program where allocations are supposed to be based on assessed risks, with states then largely passing most of the money on to police and fire departments.\n\nThe cuts were unveiled shortly after a separate federal judge in a different legal challenge ruled it was unconstitutional for the federal government to require states to cooperate on immigration enforcement actions to get FEMA disaster funding.\n\nIn her 48-page ruling, McElroy found that the federal government was weighing states' police on federal immigration enforcement on whether to reduce federal funding for the Homeland Security Grant Program and others.\n\n“What else could defendants’ decisions to cut funding to specific counterterrorism programming by conspicuous round numbered amounts — including by slashing off the millions-place digits of awarded sums — be if not arbitrary and capricious? Neither a law degree nor a degree in mathematics is required to deduce that no plausible, rational formula could produce this result,” McElroy wrote.\n\nThe Trump-appointed judge then ordered the Department of Homeland Security to restore the previously announced funding allocations to the plaintiff states.\n\n“Defendants’ wanton abuse of their role in federal grant administration is particularly troublesome given the fact that they have been entrusted with a most solemn duty: safeguarding our nation and its citizens,\" McElroy wrote. \"While the intricacies of administrative law and the terms and conditions on federal grants may seem abstract to some, the funding at issue here supports vital counterterrorism and law enforcement programs.”\n\nMcElroy notably cited the recent Brown University attack, where a gunman killed two students and injured nine others, as an event where the $1 billion federal program would be vital in responding to such a tragedy.\n\n“To hold hostage funding for programs like these based solely on what appear to be defendants’ political whims is unconscionable and, at least here, unlawful,” the Rhode Island-based judge wrote in her ruling, issued little more than a week after the Brown shooting.\n\nDHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the department plans on fighting the order.\n\n“This judicial sabotage threatens the safety of our states, counties, towns, and weakens the entire nation,\" McLaughlin said. \"We will fight to restore these critical reforms and protect American lives.”\n\nMeanwhile, attorneys general who sued the administration applauded the order.\n\n“This victory ensures that the Trump Administration cannot punish states that refuse to help carry out its cruel immigration agenda, particularly by denying them lifesaving funding that helps prepare for and respond to disasters and emergencies,” said Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell in a statement.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A judge on Monday scolded Jeffrey Epstein’s longtime confidant Ghislaine Maxwell for including confidential victim names in court papers seeking to set aside her 2021 sex trafficking conviction and free her from a 20-year prison sentence.\n\nJudge Paul A. Engelmayer said exhibits included with Maxwell’s habeas petition — which she filed on her own, without a lawyer — will be kept under seal and out of public view “until they have been reviewed and appropriately redacted to protect the identities of victims.”\n\nAny future papers Maxwell files must be submitted under seal, the judge wrote.\n\nHe said he “reminds Maxwell, in strong terms, that she is prohibited from including in any public filings any information identifying victim(s) who were not publicly identified by name during her trial.”\n\nA message seeking comment was left with Maxwell's lawyer, David Markus.\n\nMaxwell filed the petition last Wednesday, two days before the Justice Department started releasing investigative records pertaining to her and Epstein in accordance with the recently enacted Epstein Files Transparency Act.\n\nMaxwell contends that information that would have resulted in her exoneration was withheld and that false testimony was presented to the jury. She said the cumulative effect of the constitutional violations resulted in a “complete miscarriage of justice.”\n\nEngelmayer said Maxwell has until Feb. 17, 2026, to notify him whether she plans to include any information from the so-called Epstein files in her petition and must file an amended version by March 31, 2026.\n\nA slow, heavily redacted release of files\n\nProtecting victim identifies has been a key sticking point in the Justice Department’s ongoing release.\n\nThe department has said it plans to release records on a rolling basis by the end of the year, blaming the delay on the time-consuming process of obscuring victims’ names and other identifying information. So far, the department hasn’t given any notice when new records arrive.\n\nThat approach angered some accusers and members of Congress who fought to pass the transparency act. Records that were released, including photographs, interview transcripts, call logs, court records and other documents, were either already public or heavily blacked out, and many lacked necessary context.\n\nThe Senate’s top Democrat on Monday urged colleagues to take legal action over the incremental and heavily redacted release.\n\nMinority Leader Chuck Schumer introduced a resolution that, if passed, would direct the Senate to file or join lawsuits aimed at forcing the Justice Department to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the law enacted last month that required disclosure of records by last Friday.\n\n“Instead of transparency, the Trump administration released a tiny fraction of the files and blacked out massive portions of what little they provided,” Schumer, D-N.Y. said in a statement. “This is a blatant cover-up.”\n\nIn lieu of Republican support, Schumer’s resolution is largely symbolic. The Senate is off until Jan. 5, more than two weeks after the deadline. Even then, it’ll likely face an uphill battle for passage. But it allows Democrats to continue a pressure campaign for disclosure that Republicans had hoped to put behind them.\n\nThere were few revelations in the tens of thousands of pages of records that have been released so far. Some of the most eagerly awaited records, such as FBI victim interviews and internal memos shedding light on charging decisions, weren’t there.\n\nNor were there any mentions of some powerful figures who’ve been in Epstein’s orbit, like Britain’s former Prince Andrew.\n\nSome files removed, then restored\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on Sunday defended the Justice Department’s decision to release just a fraction of the files by the deadline as necessary to protect survivors of sexual abuse by the disgraced financier.\n\nBlanche pledged that the Trump administration would meet its obligation required by law. But he stressed that the department was obligated to act with caution as it goes about making public thousands of documents that can include sensitive information. And he said legal precedent had long established that obligations to protect the privacy of victims permit authorities to go beyond deadlines to ensure they are protected.\n\nBlanche, the Justice Department’s second-in-command, also defended its decision to remove several files related to the case from its public webpage, including a photograph showing Trump, less than a day after they were posted.\n\nThe missing files, which were available Friday but no longer accessible by Saturday, included images of paintings depicting nude women, and one showed a series of photographs along a credenza and in drawers. In that image, inside a drawer among other photos, was a photograph of Trump alongside Epstein, Melania Trump and Epstein’s longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nBlanche said the documents were removed because of a concern that they might also show victims of Epstein. Blanche said the Trump photo and the other documents would be reposted once redactions, if necessary, were made to protect survivors.\n\nThe Trump photograph was returned to the public webpage without alterations Sunday after it was determined that a concern by some government workers that victims may have been depicted in the picture proved unfounded, the Justice Department said.\n\n“We are not redacting information around President Trump, around any other individual involved with Mr. Epstein, and that narrative, which is not based on fact at all, is completely false,” Blanche told NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\n\nBlanche said Trump, a Republican, has labeled the Epstein matter “a hoax” because “there’s this narrative out there that the Department of Justice is hiding and protecting information about him, which is completely false.”\n\n“The Epstein files existed for years and years and years and you did not hear a peep out of a single Democrat for the past four years and yet ... lo and behold, all of a sudden, out of the blue, Senator Schumer suddenly cares about the Epstein files,” Blanche said. “That’s the hoax.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Lawyers for former CIA Director John Brennan want the Justice Department to be prevented from steering an investigation of him and other former government officials to a “favored” judge in Florida who dismissed the classified documents case against President Donald Trump.\n\nThe request Monday is addressed to U.S. District Judge Cecilia Altonaga, the chief judge in the Southern District of Florida, where federal prosecutors are pursuing a criminal investigation related to the U.S. government assessment of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Brennan and other former officials have received subpoenas, and Brennan's lawyers say he's been advised by prosecutors that he's a target of the investigation.\n\nBrennan's lawyers say in their letter that they are concerned the Justice Department is engaged in “judge-shopping” and trying to arrange for the investigation to be transferred to U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who issued favorable rulings to Trump during the classified documents case and dismissed it last year. They asked Altonaga to exercise her “supervisory authority” as chief judge to ensure the Justice Department is unable to steer the current Russia-related matter to her.\n\n“In short, we are seeking assurance that any litigation arising out of this grand jury proceeding will be heard by a judge who is selected by the court’s neutral and impartial processes, not by the prosecution’s self-interested maneuvering contrary to the interests of justice,” wrote Brennan's attorneys, Kenneth Wainstein and Natasha Harnwell-Davis. The New York Times earlier reported on the letter.\n\nIt remains unclear what specific allegations of criminal conduct are being examined by prosecutors in Florida. But the subpoenas issued last month to Brennan and other former law enforcement and intelligence officials sought documents related to the preparation of the Obama administration’s intelligence community assessment, made public in January 2017, that detailed how Russia waged a covert influence campaign to help Trump defeat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump was investigated, but not charged, during his first term over whether his campaign conspired with Russia to tip the outcome of the election. He has long sought retribution over the Russia investigation and the officials who played a key part in it.\n\nHis Justice Department in September secured a false statement and obstruction indictment against James Comey, the FBI director at the time the Russia probe was launched, though the case against him was dismissed. Its future is in doubt thanks to a judge's ruling that blocked prosecutors, in the event they try to revive the case, from relying on communications they consider to be key evidence.\n\nBrennan's lawyers say the Trump administration Justice Department tried to “forum-shop” the investigation of him to multiple jurisdictions, including Pennsylvania, before settling in Florida. But they say prosecutors have been unable to answer basic questions about why Florida is a proper venue for the investigation given that the intelligence community assessment at issue was produced by officials in the Washington, D.C., area.\n\nThough it is not clear that the Justice Department will ultimately produce charges, Brennan's request reflects the fact that judges who oversee grand jury investigations can be called upon to make important decisions and resolve significant disputes, including over witness testimony, that can affect the course of the inquiry.\n\nThe grand jury investigation is currently based in the Miami division of the Southern District of Florida, but Brennan's lawyers say they're concerned that the Trump administration may be poised to try to transfer the case to the smaller Fort Pierce division, where Cannon is the only judge. They cited as a basis for that alarm a Justice Department decision to seek an additional grand jury in Fort Pierce even though, Brennan's lawyers say, there's no apparent caseload need.\n\n“The United States Attorney’s efforts to funnel this investigation to the judge who issued this string of rulings that consistently favored President Trump’s positions in previous litigations should be seen for what it is,” Brennan's lawyers wrote.",

    "fullText": "GREENBELT, Md. (AP) — A federal judge on Monday will hear arguments about whether Kilmar Abrego Garcia should be returned to immigration custody after being free for just over a week.\n\nAbrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation to El Salvador has become a lightning rod for both sides of the immigration debate, had been in immigration detention since August. In that time, the government has said it planned to deport him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Liberia. However, officials have made no effort to deport him to the one country he has agreed to go to — Costa Rica. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, in Maryland, has even accused the government of misleading her by falsely claiming that Costa Rica was unwilling to take him.\n\nThe government's “persistent refusal to acknowledge Costa Rica as a viable removal option, their threats to send Abrego Garcia to African countries that never agreed to take him, and their misrepresentation to the Court that Liberia is now the only country available to Abrego Garcia, all reflect that whatever purpose was behind his detention, it was not for the ‘basic purpose’ of timely third-country removal,” she wrote.\n\nXinis’ Dec. 11 order that Abrego Garcia be released from immigration custody also concluded that the immigration judge who heard his case in 2019 had failed to issue an order of removal from the U.S., and he cannot be deported anywhere without a removal order.\n\nAbrego Garcia has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the U.S. illegally from El Salvador as a teenager. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country, finding he faced danger there from a gang that had targeted his family. In March, he was mistakenly deported there anyway. U.S. officials resisted calls to bring him back until the Supreme Court weighed in. However, officials have said he cannot stay in the U.S. and have vowed to deport him to a third country.\n\nIn filings last week, government attorneys argued that, with or without a final order of removal, they are still working to deport Abrego Garcia, so they can legally detain him during the process.\n\n“If there is no final order of removal, immigration proceedings are ongoing, and Petitioner is subject to pre-final order detention,” they wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, Abrego Garcia's attorneys cited a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that “because immigration proceedings ‘are civil, not criminal’ detention must be ‘nonpunitive.’” They argued that in Abrego Garcia's case, detention is punitive because the government wants to be allowed to hold him indefinitely without a viable plan to deport him.\n\n“If immigration detention does not serve the legitimate purpose of effectuating reasonably foreseeable removal, it is punitive, potentially indefinite, and unconstitutional,” they wrote.",

The decision comes less than two months after Tesla shareholders approved a new plan that could be worth $1tn to Musk, already the world’s richest person, in a decade’s time. Musk’s fortune currently stands at an estimated $600bn.\n\nRescinding the pay deal would be “inequitable”, and would leave Musk “uncompensated for his time and efforts over a period of six years”, the Delaware supreme court justices wrote, echoing arguments from Tesla board members earlier this year.\n\nAt the company’s annual meeting in Austin, Texas, this November, shareholders had approved a stopgap measure for Musk, ensuring – regardless of how the Delaware supreme court ruled on this appeal – that he would get the $56bn his supporters say he is owed.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment or \n\nBoth of the compensation packages, as well as other pay plans approved by Tesla shareholders, require Musk to meet a number of lofty goals related to product development and increasing the company’s value to $8.5tn in order to cash out on those awards.\n\nThe case that first invalidated the original pay package was launched seven years ago when a Tesla stockholder, who held just nine shares at the time, filed a suit arguing that the plan was set up to overpay the world’s richest person. That first ruling voided the billions Musk was to receive, which left the Tesla co-founder less than pleased.\n\nNot only did Musk relocate Tesla to Texas from Delaware, where it was incorporated at the time the suit began, he also publicly lashed out against the state and specifically its court of chancery and chief judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick.\n\n“She has done more to damage Delaware than any judge in modern history,” he wrote on X, his social media platform, in February 2024.\n\nTesla stockholders in 2024 were again asked to vote on the 2018 pay package. They approved it, and once again, McCormick struck it down, ruling that the “Superstar CEO”, as she called him, had undue influence in developing his own pay package and that stockholders weren’t fully informed ahead of the vote.\n\nMusk has voiced his displeasure ever since.\n\n“Any lawyer still recommending incorporation in Delaware at this point should be sued for malpractice,” he posted online earlier this year.\n\nIn Friday’s opinion, the justices agreed with McCormick’s earlier findings that there was a breach of fiduciary duty in developing the original package and presenting it to shareholders. They ordered $1 be paid to the plaintiff in nominal damages.\n\nHowever, the five judges agreed that rescinding Musk’s full pay package wasn’t appropriate.\n\nWhile Musk has publicly called for other companies to follow his lead and leave Delaware – which has historically been home to more than 60% of Fortune 500 companies – experts have tracked only a few dozen companies that have actually done so. That includes big companies including Dropbox and Coinbase, while other tech companies like Meta have only threatened to leave.",

    "fullText": "McKINNEY, Texas (AP) — Court documents detailing the divorce of Republican U.S. Senate candidate and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and his wife, state Sen. Angela Paxton, were released Friday by order of a judge, months after she filed citing “biblical grounds.”\n\nThe initial filing showed that Angela Paxton sought the divorce on the grounds that Ken Paxton had committed adultery, but included no additional details. She had previously referenced “recent discoveries” when announcing the filing on social media in July. In a separate filing, Ken Paxton denied the allegations in the divorce petition. Future filings will also be released to the public after the Paxtons and a coalition of media outlets came to an agreement.\n\n“It’s a victory, I think, for the American public and for the Texas voters,” Tyler Bexley, an attorney for the media intervenors, told reporters after the judge ordered the documents unsealed.\n\nThe divorce and the surrounding speculation have only fueled attacks against Paxton in one of the nation’s most heated Republican primaries as he seeks to unseat Sen. John Cornyn. Whether the divorce details resonate with voters remains to be seen, with the Senate primary set for March 3. Despite years of controversy, the three-term attorney general has remained competitive in the race, which includes Rep. Wesley Hunt.\n\nThe divorce comes after 38 years of marriage, during which Angela Paxton had supported her husband through a series of legal troubles, including state and federal corruption investigations. A state securities fraud indictment against Ken Paxton was dismissed after a 2024 plea deal in which he agreed to pay restitution and complete community service, and the Justice Department dropped a federal corruption probe earlier this year.\n\nAngela Paxton also stood by Ken Paxton's side during that impeachment trial, which publicly exposed an extramarital affair. The 2023 impeachment trial ended in an acquittal for him.\n\nPaxton’s support in Texas has remained strong amid a decade of legal troubles. He won reelection in 2022 by nearly 10 percentage points.\n\nPaxton launched his bid to unseat Cornyn in April and has since drawn attacks from Senate Republicans’ campaign arm, with some in the party concerned that while Paxton could prevail in the GOP primary, he may complicate the general election and force national Republicans to spend heavily to hold the seat. On the Democratic side, U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett and state Rep. James Talarico are facing off in their party’s primary.\n\nGroups supporting Cornyn have spent more than $21 million on television ads this year, according to AdImpact, to promote the four-term senator and attack Paxton.\n\n“What Ken Paxton has put his family through is truly repulsive and disgusting,” National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesperson Joanna Rodriguez said in July. “No one should have to endure what Angela Paxton has, and we pray for her as she chooses to stand up for herself and her family during this difficult time.”\n\nPaxton has been a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, while Cornyn has at times drawn criticism within his own party for working with Democrats. Trump’s endorsement is expected to be a decisive factor in Texas, which he won in 2024 by nearly 14 percentage points. Trump has not yet endorsed in the race.\n\nJudge Robert Brotherton approved the agreement on Friday to release the records, which had been sealed following a request by Angela Paxton shortly after she filed. Another judge signed the agreed order to seal the records. In a filing after media outlets and the nonprofit Campaign for Accountability intervened to have the documents unsealed, Ken Paxton said he was opposed to the documents being publicly released.\n\nBexley said Friday that the media outlets he represents believe that voters have the right to know information about the case as “they are making decisions in the upcoming elections.”\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of Ken Paxton at https://apnews.com/hub/ken-paxton.",

(AP) — A judge on Friday ordered special elections for the Mississippi Supreme Court after earlier finding that the electoral map used to select justices violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nU.S. District Judge Sharion Aycock in August ordered Mississippi to redraw the map, which was enacted in 1987, concluding the current configuration dilutes the power of Black voters. The Friday ruling gives the Mississippi Legislature until the end of its 2026 regular session to redraw the map.\n\nSection 2, which is the primary way plaintiffs can push back against racially discriminatory election practices, is currently being challenged at the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nOnce the legislature approves a new map, Aycock wrote that she will move quickly to meet any deadlines necessary to hold the special elections in November 2026.\n\nAycock also wrote that she will defer deciding which seats will be subject to a special election until after the new map has been adopted.\n\nThe order follows a 2022 lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union, which argued the current map cuts Mississippi’s Delta region — a historically Black area — in half, diminishing the Black vote in the Central District.\n\n“Mississippi is nearly 40% Black, but has never had more than one Black Justice on the nine-member Court,\" Ari Savitzky, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project, wrote in a statement. \"We couldn’t be happier to see justice on the horizon.”\n\nIn her August ruling, Aycock noted only four Black people have served on Mississippi’s Supreme Court. All of them held the same seat in the Central District and were first appointed to the position by a sitting governor.\n\nThe Mississippi Secretary of State’s Office is appealing Aycock’s August ruling. The Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has stayed its proceedings pending the outcomes of the SCOTUS case and other related cases.\n\nThe Mississippi Secretary of State and Attorney General’s offices did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn December, two Mississippi Supreme Court justices were appointed to federal judgeships. Gov. Tate Reeves will appoint replacements to serve until new justices can be elected.\n\nIn Mississippi, Supreme Court elections are nonpartisan.",

And office-seekers aren't entitled to presidential immunity, they contend.\n\n“President Trump has the burden of proof here,” said plaintiffs' attorney Joseph Sellers. “We submit that he hasn't come anywhere close to satisfying that burden.”\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who chaired the House Homeland Security Committee, sued Trump, his personal attorney Rudolph Giuliani and members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers extremist groups over the Jan. 6 riot. Other Democratic members of Congress later joined the litigation.\n\nThe civil claims survived Trump's sweeping act of clemency on the first day of his second term, when he pardoned, commuted prison sentences and ordered the dismissal of all 1,500-plus criminal cases stemming from the Capitol siege.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge on Wednesday blocked Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 's attempt to shut down an aging oil pipeline running beneath a channel linking two of the Great Lakes, finding that only the federal government can regulate interstate pipeline safety.\n\nWhitmer, a Democrat, ordered regulators in 2020 to revoke an easement that allows Enbridge Inc. to operate a 4.5-mile (6.4) kilometer pipeline segment under the Straits of Mackinac, which link Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Whitmer made the move out of concern that the 72-year-old pipeline could rupture and cause a catastrophic spill.\n\nEnbridge filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block the revocation and the pipeline continues to operate. President Donald Trump's administration argued in filings this year that Whitmer's order interferes with U.S. foreign energy policy and that only the federal government, not the states, can regulate pipeline safety. The pipeline segment, known as Line 5, moves crude oil between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario.\n\nU.S. District Judge Robert Jonker wrote in an opinion that revoking the easement would effectively shut down Line 5. He found that Congress expressly prohibited states from regulating interstate pipeline safety in the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992. He also noted that the United States and Canada agree that Michigan's attempt to shut down the pipeline interferes with their federal foreign policy positions and trade relations.\n\n“An oil spill in Michigan's Great Lakes would undoubtedly be an environmental catastrophe. And Michigan would undoubtedly be the recipient of almost all the environmental damage that would result,” Jonker wrote. “But for better or worse, the national government has unequivocally decided to displace state power in this area and assume exclusive responsibility for interstate pipeline safety.”\n\nA message seeking comment was left for a spokesperson for Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, whose office represented Whitmer's administration in the lawsuit. A Whitmer spokesperson referred questions to Nessel.\n\nEnbridge issued a statement saying the line is safe and that Jonker's ruling protects both the United States and Canada from “significant energy disruptions.”\n\nMultiple other legal challenges are swirling around Line 5 in Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nNessel filed her own action in 2019 seeking to void the easement in the straits. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently weighing whether that case belongs in state or federal court. And a number of environmental groups and tribes have sued challenging state permits authorizing Enbridge's plan to build a protective tunnel around the straits segment. That case is pending before the Michigan state Supreme Court.\n\nIn Wisconsin, a federal judge ruled in 2023 that Enbridge must remove a section of Line 5 that runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa's reservation. The company has proposed a 41-mile (66-kilometer) route around the reservation, but the tribe and environmentalists say construction could harm the environment and the new route would still leave the region vulnerable to a spill.\n\nThe Bad River has sued in state court seeking to void state permits for the project; that case is still pending. The tribe along with a number of environmental groups also is challenging the permits through the state's contested case process, a proceeding similar to a lawsuit that will culminate with an administrative law judge's ruling.\n\nThe tribe filed a federal lawsuit on Tuesday in Washington, D.C., challenging U.S. Army Corps of Engineer permits authorizing the reroute.",

Filed by or on behalf of someone in custody, it challenges constitutional violations, such as ineffective legal counsel or unfair trials, and seeks release or other relief, often as a last resort after appeals are exhausted.\n\n“Since the conclusion of her trial, substantial new evidence has emerged from related civil actions, Government disclosures, investigative reports, and documents demonstrating constitutional violations that undermined the fairness of her proceeding,” the filing in Manhattan federal court said. “In the light of the full evidentiary record, no reasonable juror would have convicted her.”\n\nThe filing came just two days before records in her case were scheduled to be released publicly as a result of President Donald Trump's signing of the Epstein Files Transparency Act. The law, signed after months of public and political pressure, requires the Justice Department to provide the public with Epstein-related records by Dec. 19.\n\nForced to act by the new transparency law, the Justice Department has said it plans to release 18 categories of investigative materials gathered in the massive sex trafficking probe, including search warrants, financial records, notes from interviews with victims, and data from electronic devices.\n\nEpstein, a millionaire financier, was arrested in July 2019 on sex trafficking charges. A month later, he was found dead in his cell at a New York federal jail and the death was ruled a suicide. Maxwell, a British socialite, was arrested a year later and was convicted of sex trafficking in December 2021. She was interviewed by the Justice Department’s second-in-command in July and was soon afterward moved from a federal prison in Florida to a prison camp in Texas.\n\nAfter the Justice Department asked a New York federal judge to permit grand jury and discovery materials gathered prior to her trial to be released publicly, attorney David Markus wrote on her behalf that while Maxwell now “does not take a position” on unsealing documents from her case, doing so “would create undue prejudice so severe that it would foreclose the possibility of a fair retrial” if her habeas petition succeeds.\n\nThe records, Markus said, “contain untested and unproven allegations.”\n\nLast week, Judge Paul A. Engelmayer in Manhattan granted the Justice Department's request to publicly release the materials.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said during a news conference on another topic that he would follow the law and the judge's orders pertaining to the records.\n\nEngelmayer, who along with other judges had previously rejected Justice Department unsealing requests before the transparency law was passed, said the materials “do not identify any person other than Epstein and Maxwell as having had sexual contact with a minor.”",

    "description": "Ex-Salomon Brothers bond trader Howard Rubin had offered a $70 million bail package in his sex trafficking case. A judge said she couldn't be sure",
    "fullText": "Howard \"Howie\" Rubin, a once-prominent Salomon Brothers investment banker featured in the 1985 Wall Street expose \"Liar's Poker,\" must remain in a federal jail in Brooklyn indefinitely as he fights sex-trafficking charges, a judge ruled on Wednesday.\n\nIt was the third bail denial for Rubin, accused of paying women, many of them former Playboy models, $5,000 to engage in \"fetish play,\" then constraining and torturing them, including by electrocuting them against their will.\n\nMagistrate Judge Peggy Kuo said her main concern is the risk that the wealthy financier, who has a $70 million account based in the Cayman Islands, would flee the country.\n\n\"The thing that is troubling me is I don't know if I can trust Mr. Rubin,\" Kuo said in denying bail. She said she has no way of knowing for certain if Rubin is mulling, \"What does my life look like if I flee, and what does it look like if I stay?\"\n\nRubin's 10-count indictment alleges a series of attacks against 10 Jane Does between 2009 and 2019 in luxury hotels and a soundproofed bedroom \"sex dungeon\" at his Manhattan penthouse apartment.\n\nRubin, 70, of Fairfield, Connecticut, pleaded not guilty and has been held without bail since his arrest in September. Rubin was once considered one of Wall Street's most skilled and aggressive traders of complex mortgage securities, earning him roles at influential firms like Merrill Lynch and Soros Fund Management.\n\nIn his latest bid for freedom, his lawyers had offered a $70 million bond, co-signed by family members. They include his wife, who has been divorcing him since 2021, and who wrote a letter to the judge extolling his devotion to three young grandchildren, who call him \"Pops.\"\n\n\"There is no allegation that Mr. Rubin engaged in any BDSM activity since 2019,\" his lawyers wrote in bail arguments filed Tuesday. \"He has been living in Connecticut for years, devoted to the care of his grandchildren,\" they wrote.\n\nFederal prosecutors countered that no amount of bail or electronic monitoring could guarantee Rubin's return to court; they also say that he has used threats and coercion to silence his accusers, allegations Rubin denies.\n\nRubin's former personal assistant, Jennifer Powers, has been charged with pocketing millions of dollars to arrange the encounters; she has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking charges and is free on $850,000 bail.\n\nHer husband, Stephen Powers, is free on $250,000, according to court records. Both Powers have pleaded not guilty to bank and tax fraud in connection with the encounters.\n\nThree attorneys for Rubin did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. A Department of Justice spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nRubin is due back in court on January 15. If convicted of the top sex trafficking charge, he faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years and as much as life in prison.",

    "fullText": "Two years after the Supreme Court effectively ended race-conscious college admissions nationwide, Johns Hopkins University has seen a significant change in the racial makeup of its freshman class, according to newly released enrollment data.\n\nSince 2023, the number of Asian first-year undergraduate students, as measured by federal reporting standards, has risen nearly 20 percentage points, to 45.1% from 25.6%. Black first-year student representation, meanwhile, has been cut in half, dropping to 4% from 9.8%, as has the Hispanic student population, which fell to 10.1% this year from 20.8% two years ago. White freshman enrollment remained relatively flat, at 21% in 2025, compared with 19.3% in 2023. Those self-reporting as white fell more sharply to 30.9% from 39.1%.\n\nThe data offer a clear, local snapshot of how elite universities may be changing in the wake of the 2023 ruling, which prohibited schools from considering race in admissions. While universities across the country warned the decision could reduce racial diversity, Johns Hopkins’ numbers show an especially stark shift.\n\n“Since the U.S. Supreme Court decision in [Students for Fair Admissions] v Harvard, we have been navigating an evolving legal and regulatory environment,” said university spokesman J.B. Bird in an email to the Baltimore Sun. “We continue to work on opening our doors as wide as possible to students from all backgrounds and perspectives.”\n\nThe research university has seen some success in its efforts to diversify by income level, regardless of race. The 2025 freshman class has the highest-ever number of Pell grant recipients, at 24.1%, up slightly from 23.8% last year and 21.6% the year before. First-generation college student admission remained flat from last year at 20.3% percent, but up from 19.4% in 2023. Both Pell grant recipients and first-generation college students had risen steadily since 2010.\n\nThe university’s new Tuition Promise program could also increase diversity in the coming years, said Amelia, a second-year graduate student who declined to give her last name.\n\nThe program, which begins next year, with January admissions, offers a free education to students whose families earn less than $200,000, and includes living expenses for those making less than $100,000.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision is already changing higher education in more ways than student body demographics can reveal, said Bryan Cook higher education policy director of the nonpartisan Urban Institute think tank. Johns Hopkins is not unique, though the court’s decision more strongly impacted private, elite college and universities that had been trying to recruit more diverse student bodies, Cook said. Schools like community colleges that accept all applications, and state schools that rely primarily on test scores for admissions, would not be affected, he said.\n\nA lot of institutions are having to make significant changes in their policies,” Cook said. “In many cases, this is already changing the demographics of what campuses look like.”\n\nIt’s difficult to determine the whole story, he said, admissions data only shows part of what is happening.\n\n“We know nothing about the demographics of their applicant pool and how that might line up with admissions,” Cook explained. “We don’t know what’s happening universally across all schools.”\n\nThe Urban Institute reached out to universities to request applicant data to improve their understanding, publishing their findings in July of 2025.\n\n“Early analysis from 18 institutions suggests that Black students’ share of the applicant pool increased more between 2023 and 2024 than in any of the prior five years,” the report states, “but their share of the admitted student pool held constant or even decreased. Furthermore, an increasing number of applicants have chosen not to disclose their race or ethnicity.”\n\nAmong elite universities, those admitting less than half of their applicants, Black student admissions fell to 5.9% in 2024 from 6.6% in 2023, while Black admissions at less selective schools remained level.\n\nMost Americans support fair admissions, said Edward Blum, the president of Students for Fair Admissions, the organization that brought the lawsuit against Harvard, resulting in the Supreme Court decision.\n\n“Credible polling from across the political spectrum indicates that Americans agree that a student’s race or ethnicity should not be considered as a factor in whether that student is accepted or rejected at any university,” Blum said.\n\nHopkins student Aaden, who asked to only be identified by his first name.\n\n“I believe it is important to have a diverse student body,” said Aaden, a third-year chemistry student, “although I think if we were picking people because of their race, it’s not fair to Asian and white students. People with lower grades might be picked because of their race.”\n\nAaden lives in Florida, where his parents immigrated from the Caribbean. He said he hasn’t experienced racism on campus but understands how new Black and Hispanic students might feel more isolated this year.\n\nMaria Laskaris, a college counselor from TopTier Admissions, helps students prepare for and get into schools best suited for their needs, beginning younger than high school age. She agreed that the Supreme Court ruling affects primarily highly selective private institutions, but said the changes would not necessarily change how she advises minority student clients.\n\n“I would make sure that any student I advise is aware of the landscape in which they are applying to college and various policies of the colleges they’re interested in,” she said. “It’s about how you set yourself apart. What do you bring to the table that makes you stand out from other applicants?”\n\nTricia Bishop contributed to this report.\n\nHave a news tip?

    "title": "CA judge rules Tesla lied about FSD, must fix marketing within 60 days",
    "description": "Tesla engaged in false advertising for its Full Self-Driving system. Unless it fixes the issues, its license to sell in CA will be suspended.",
    "fullText": "A California judge ruled late Tuesday afternoon that Tesla engaged in “deceptive marketing” in reference to its Full Self-Driving system, and that Tesla’s license to sell and produce cars in the state should be revoked for 30 days.\n\nHowever, the California DMV has said it will give Tesla 60 days to comply and fix its marketing before going through with the suspension.\n\nThe ruling is big news in a case that has been ongoing for years now.\n\nTesla has been selling level 2 driver assist software since 2016 which it calls “Full Self-Driving” (FSD), despite that this software did not (and still does not) make its cars capable of driving themselves.\n\nThis name has attracted much consternation over the years, becoming more absurd as each of Tesla’s predicted deadlines for the advent of full autonomy blow by.\n\nTesla also provides software under the name “Autopilot,” another term that evokes some level of autonomy, though perhaps not as explicitly as the aforementioned FSD. Tesla long held the position that this word is meant to evoke airplane-like systems that still require a pilot, but can just do most of the work for them.\n\nSo eventually, in 2021, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) officially started an investigation into Tesla’s marketing claims, to determine whether the company had lied to consumers.\n\nCalifornia found that the company was saying different things to the public than it was saying to the DMV.\n\nThe DMV then sent an official inquiry to Tesla in 2022, asking for it to respond to the claim that it was creating incorrect perceptions about the capabilities of its system. Tesla’s response stated that it had been allowed to lie about FSD for so long that it should get to keep going, which was apparently not persuasive enough to the courts, and the case was then slated for trial.\n\nDuring this time, the California legislature got involved as well, passing a law that specifically banned automakers from deceiving consumers into thinking vehicles have more autonomous capabilities than they do.\n\nWell, after all these investigations and waiting, we finally have an an answer, and the judge’s ruling makes it quite clear: Tesla lied to consumers about its autonomous capabilities.\n\nThe court looked at Tesla’s marketing claims and also at surveys of people exposed to those claims and their opinion of whether a Tesla would be able to drive itself, given the marketing messages put out by the company.\n\nIt found problems both with the word Autopilot and the phrase Full Self-Driving.\n\nThe word “Autopilot” was not found to be “unambiguously false,” but the court said that its use “follows a long but unlawful tradition of ‘intentionally (using) ambiguity to mislead consumers while maintaining some level of deniability about the intended meaning.'” The court found that a reasonable person could believe that a car on Autopilot doesn’t require their constant undivided attention, which is incorrect as the driver is still fully responsible for the vehicle.\n\nOn “Full Self-Driving,” the court was even more harsh. It found that this feature name is “actually, unambiguously false and counterfactual” (comically, Tesla tried to argue here that “no reasonable person” could believe that Full Self-Driving actually means Full Self-Driving).\n\nThe court noted other language used by Tesla, including marketing copy that said “the system is designed to be able to conduct short and long distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver’s seat,” and suggested that “legal reasons” are the only things holding Tesla back from full autonomy. Tesla tried to say that this was a statement of future intent, but the court found that its use of the present tense shows otherwise.\n\nTesla has repeatedly changed its wording around FSD, first calling it Full Self-Driving Capability, then changing that to Full Self-Driving (Supervised) to emphasize the need for a driver to supervise the vehicle. The court noted these changes, and then said it would not be a burden to force Tesla to change its marketing further to clarify that its cars do not drive themselves.\n\nWhich leads us to the proposed legal remedy: the court said that the DMV could suspend or revoke Tesla’s licenses for 30 days, stopping its ability to sell or build cars in the state.\n\nTesla’s first factory is in Fremont, California, where it still builds around half a million vehicles a year and employs some ~20,000 employees. Tesla says this remedy would be “draconian,” but the court said that without this option, there’s no reason to believe Tesla would stop its misrepresentations to the public.\n\nThe court also examined the possibility of financial restitution, but deemed that inappropriate. Since the case did not establish any quantifiable financial harm done by Tesla’s misrepresentation and noted the impracticality of accounting for that harm.\n\nThis ruling does not yet mean that Tesla can’t sell cars in California, which is its largest market in the US by far. The court noted that the DMV has the option of suspension or revocation, which the DMV can do at its discretion. And the DMV has said that it will allow Tesla 60 days to comply with the order before it takes action, and that it would focus on Tesla’s dealer license rather than its manufacturing license.\n\nThis would mean, specifically, that Tesla not refer to a level 2 driving system as “Autopilot” or using language that suggests these vehicles are autonomous. It will have to change its marketing materials and stop making public statements misleading the public about its autonomous capabilities.\n\nTesla said after the ruling that “sales in California will continue uninterrupted.” But we’ll see what happens in 60 days, and what sort of changes Tesla does or does not make to its deceptive marketing.\n\nTuesday’s ruling is just one of many legal cases against Tesla right now, specifically having to do with FSD. One relevant case is a class action lawsuit in California claiming Tesla misled customers about its cars self-driving capabilities. This ruling could provide fuel for that lawsuit, given a California judge has already gone on the record with an official determination that Tesla misled the public about FSD.\n\nThe 30% federal solar tax credit is ending this year.

    "description": "The judge ruled Tesla should have to suspend manufacturing and sales in California for 30 days, but the DMV stayed those rulings for 90 days to allow Tesla to comply.",
    "fullText": "An administrative law judge has ruled that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing that gave customers a false impression of the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving driver assistance software, a pivotal development in a years-long case initiated by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nThe judge agreed with the state DMV’s request to suspend Tesla sales for 30 days as a penalty for its actions, but the DMV stayed the order and is giving Tesla 60 days to modify or remove any deceptive language before implementing the suspension, according to multiple outlets. The judge also recommended suspending Tesla’s manufacturing license for 30 days, but the DMV stayed that order, too, according to Bloomberg News.\n\n“The DMV’s decision today confirms that the department will hold every vehicle manufacturer to the highest safety standards to keep California’s drivers, passengers and pedestrians protected,” DMV director Steve Gordon said in a statement. “Tesla can take simple steps to pause this decision and permanently resolve this issue — steps autonomous vehicle companies and other automakers have been able to achieve in California’s nation-leading and supportive innovation marketplace.”\n\nTesla said in a post on X that: “Sales in California will continue uninterrupted.”\n\n“This was a ‘consumer protection’ order about the use of the term ‘Autopilot’ in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there’s a problem,” the company wrote.\n\nAfter the 60-day window, Tesla can appeal the decision and should Tesla comply, the suspensions will be dropped. But it’s not immediately clear what steps the DMV wants Tesla to take, beyond telling the company to “take action regarding its use of the term ‘autopilot.’” The DMV did not immediately respond to a request for clarification, or to a request regarding Tesla’s apparent plan to ignore the decision.\n\nTesla has faced multiple investigations from the California Attorney General, the Department of Justice, and the Securities and Exchange Commission over similar allegations that its marketing around partial autonomy systems was misleading. The company has also faced (and now settled) a number of personal civil lawsuits over crashes involving its Autopilot technology.\n\nThe case brought by the CA DMV has been winding through the state’s Office of Administrative Hearings for years. The agency essentially accused Tesla of making customers believe that its advanced driver assistance systems were capable of high levels of autonomy. This led to overconfidence in the systems, the DMV alleged, which has contributed to dozens of crashes and multiple deaths. Tesla refuted these claims by saying its marketing was protected speech.\n\nA shutdown of sales in California, even temporary, could have a major impact on Tesla’s business as it remains the company’s largest market in the United States. A manufacturing suspension could also hurt Tesla’s business. While the company has constructed a massive factory in Austin, Texas (and moved its official headquarters to the same location), it still relies on its Fremont, California factory to make hundreds of thousands of vehicles, including all North American-bound Model 3 sedans.\n\nThe judge’s decision comes at a moment when Tesla is advancing its Robotaxi service test in Austin. Over the weekend, the company removed the safety monitors from its small fleet in the city. It had been offering rides to customers in the city for the last six months, but with a safety monitor either in the driver’s or passenger’s seat. Those vehicles are running a different version of Tesla’s driving software than what the automaker’s customers have in their cars, CEO Elon Musk has said.\n\nThis story has been updated to include information from the DMV’s press release and Tesla’s response.",

    "fullText": "Tesla may have to rebrand Autopilot.\n\nSteve Gordon, the Director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles, said in a media briefing on Tuesday that Tesla has 90 days to amend its advertising language or face a 30-day suspension from selling in California.\n\nGordon said on Tuesday that the DMV is specifically asking Tesla to change the name \"Autopilot\" to clarify that the company has advanced driving systems, which do not equate to an automated system or an autonomous vehicle. Changes must be made within 90 days, or the DMV will \"enforce the cessation of sales.\"\n\n\"My guess is that they will pursue some remedy,\" said Gordon of what Tesla might do next, \"but the easiest one for them is just to come into compliance.\"\n\nIn response to the DMV's decision, a Tesla spokesperson told Business Insider that this is \"a 'consumer protection' order about the use of the term 'Autopilot' in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there's a problem.\"\n\n\"Sales in California will continue uninterrupted,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nOn November 21, Administrative Judge Juliet E. Cox made a proposed decision about whether Tesla has misled consumers into thinking its cars are more capable of driving themselves than they actually are, and transmitted it to the DMV for consideration. The document containing the proposal, however, has been withheld from the public and won't be released till December 22.\n\nGordon said during the Tuesday briefing that Cox recommended both a suspension of Tesla's license to sell and to manufacture in California. The DMV, however, decided not to pursue a suspension of the license to manufacture and put a temporary 90-day stay on the suspension of the license to sell for Tesla to make amends.\n\n\"They're very important to the state,\" said Gordon of Tesla. \"We want to be fair to them and give them a chance to see if they can find a resolution now that there is a ruling from the administrative law judge.\"\n\n\"If you look at the Q3 report of this year, Tesla has the top-selling car, the Model Y, in its segment,\" Gordon added. \"We felt that the leverage via the sales channel was sufficient to get compliance.\"\n\nThe notice to Tesla follows a weeklong hearing in July at the administrative court in Oakland. In 2022, the DMV sued Tesla, accusing the carmaker of misleading consumers through Tesla's advertisements and by naming its driver assistance technologies \"Full Self-Driving\" and \"Autopilot.\"\n\nTesla, which had a rocky year, denied that the company had ever tried to conceal the fact that its vehicles cannot fully drive themselves.\n\nThe DMV sought to suspend Tesla's ability to sell cars in the state for at least 30 days and award consumers monetary damages.\n\nThe CA DMV wrote in its complaint that on multiple occasions in 2021 and 2022, Tesla's website advertised its FSD driver assistance system as being \"designed to be able to conduct short and long-distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver's seat.\"\n\nTesla's lawyers said during the hearing that the company has always informed buyers that they \"cannot fully rely\" on FSD or Autopilot.\n\n\"Cars with Full Self-Driving capabilities are currently not capable of driving themselves,\" said Attorney Matthew Benedetto, a member of Tesla's legal team, during the hearing.",

    "fullText": "A High Court judge has thrown out a legal claim from a man who claimed to represent a Saudi prince in an alleged sale of Reform UK treasurer Nick Candy’s penthouse.\n\nMichael Brown brought “hopeless” legal action against Mr Candy and a group of eight others, including One Hyde Park, the Knightsbridge complex that contains Mr Candy’s penthouse, Judge Neil Cadwallader said.\n\nMr Brown, who represented himself at a Tuesday hearing but left halfway through citing medical reasons, appeared to be seeking £659 million over an alleged fraudulent valuation of the penthouse and an alleged breach of contract, the judge said.\n\n“The nature of the claim is extremely difficult to discern from the brief details given in the claim form and the witness evidence of the claimant, while expanding these details somewhat does not make the matter any clearer,” the judge said.\n\nHe added: “Not only were these claims hopeless, they were misconceived and baseless and bound to fail.”\n\nDavid Lascelles, for Mr Candy, said in written submissions that Mr Brown had contacted Mr Candy’s representatives in 2016, saying that a Saudi prince was interested in buying the penthouse at One Hyde Park.\n\nIn July of that year, Mr Candy provided a letter from the estate agency Savills which showed an estimated value of £160 million and that a full valuation could be given if negotiations progressed.\n\nMr Lascelles said that two days later, however, Mr Brown sent an email saying he had received racist abuse at the hotel next to One Hyde Park, the Mandarin Oriental.\n\nHe said that he could not recommend the sale of the penthouse, meaning the sale was off.\n\nIn 2018, Mr Brown brought legal action at the High Court against Mr Candy, his company Candy Capital, and One Hyde Park, attempting to claim £1.5 billion, but this was thrown out by a judge.\n\nMr Lascelles said: “The claimant now seeks to resurrect the claims already found to be totally without merit.”\n\nHe continued: “It is a reasonable inference that the claimant is seeking to deploy these proceedings to exert pressure and to generate publicity by scurrilous allegations, rather than to pursue any properly arguable legal claim.\n\n“He has wasted significant public resources, including the time of numerous judges, masters and employees of HM Courts and Tribunals Service, against whom he has also made serious and wholly unfounded allegations of wrongdoing.”\n\nMr Brown was made bankrupt following the previous litigation after he failed to pay legal costs.\n\nAt the hearing on Tuesday, he said he was made bankrupt as a result of fraud.\n\nHe said: “Any reasonable person would say that is a kangaroo court. This is the basic principle, I am entitled to have a fair trial and a completely fair fight.\n\n“How can it be a fair fight if I am outnumbered?”\n\nHe also asked the court to allow his case to continue because he was “hoping to get the backing of Elon Musk”.\n\nIf that happens, the case “will be all over”, he added.\n\nMr Brown also claimed that lawyers for Mr Candy had “cheated” by confirming a witness statement as true when they knew it to be false.\n\nHe said that this amounted to contempt of court, but it was refused by Judge Cadwallader, who described Mr Brown’s claims as “incoherent”.\n\nThe judge said: “Mr Brown attempted to suggest that the lawyers acting for the defendants were clever people and used to the exercise of working out what the claim means, but that is no answer.\n\n“They are entitled not to have to guess.”\n\nHe continued: “Accordingly, I will make an order dismissing the claimant’s claim on all these grounds against all the defendants.”\n\nJudge Cadwallader also ordered a civil restraining order to prevent Mr Brown from bringing further legal action about the same issue and ordered him to pay costs.",

    "fullText": "Paris Saint-Germain have been ordered by a Paris labour court to pay Kylian Mbappe €60 million in unpaid salary and bonuses, bringing an end to a prolonged legal dispute between the club and their former forward.\n\nThe ruling, delivered earlier today, follows months of proceedings after Mbappe claimed PSG withheld wages and contractual bonuses in the final months of his deal before his free transfer to Real Madrid in the summer of 2024.\n\nThe France captain argued that payments for April, May and June of that year were never made, despite being stipulated in his contract.\n\nJudges ruled in Mbappe’s favour, concluding that PSG failed to pay three months of salary as well as an ethics bonus and a signing bonus.\n\nThe court noted that these outstanding sums had already been recognised by the French Professional Football League in decisions taken in September and October last year, strengthening the player’s case.\n\nPSG attempted to argue that Mbappe had agreed to forgo the payments as part of an informal arrangement linked to his reintegration into the squad during the 2023-24 season.\n\nHowever, the court stated that the club was unable to provide any written agreement proving that the player had waived his contractual rights, leading to that defence being dismissed.\n\nMbappe’s lawyer, Frederique Cassereau, welcomed the ruling and described it as a predictable outcome under French labour law. She said the decision simply reflected the fact that salaries and bonuses written into a contract must be paid in full.\n\nWhile Mbappe succeeded in securing the €60m award, the court rejected several additional claims made on his behalf.\n\nAllegations of moral harassment, concealed work and breaches of the employer’s duty of care were all dismissed, and the court declined to reclassify his fixed-term contract as a permanent one, which limited the scope for further compensation.\n\nPSG had also accused Mbappe of acting disloyally by concealing his intention not to renew his contract, arguing that this deprived the club of the chance to secure a significant transfer fee.\n\nThe judges ruled that such considerations were not relevant to the core issue of unpaid remuneration and therefore had no bearing on the outcome.\n\nMbappe spent seven years at PSG after initially joining from Monaco in 2017, winning six Ligue 1 titles and 15 major trophies. He left as the club’s all-time leading scorer with 256 goals in 308 appearances.\n\nThe verdict closes a contentious chapter in the relationship between PSG and their former talisman and confirms the club’s obligation to settle the outstanding payments in full.",

    "fullText": "SYDNEY (AP) — A judge sentenced a Sydney taekwondo instructor on Tuesday to life in prison without possibility of release for murdering a 7-year-old student and the boy’s parents.\n\nKwang Kyung Yoo, 51, sat with his head bowed as Justice Ian Harrison said he would never be eligible for parole.\n\nHarrison said Yoo has been motivated by the jealousy he felt for the family’s financial success.\n\n“I’m satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of these offenses is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of a life sentence,” Harrison told the New South Wales Supreme Court.\n\nHarrison said Yoo had no reason to murder the boy or his parents in February last year.\n\nState law prevents child victims of crime from being identified, so the boy’s parents also can’t be named.\n\nYoo and his victims were all born in South Korea.\n\nYoo had pleaded guilty to the three murders at an earlier court appearance. He had no prior criminal record.\n\nYoo had strangled the boy and his 41-year-old mom in his Lion’s Taekwondo and Martial Arts Academy in western Sydney. He owed tens of thousands of dollars at the time and was behind in rent on the academy.\n\nHe took the mother’s Apple watch and drove her luxury BMW car to the family home where he stabbed the boy’s 39-year-old father to death.\n\nYoo was injured in the struggle in the home and drove himself to hospital where he told medical staff he had been attacked in a supermarket car park. Police arrested him at the hospital.\n\nAfter his arrest, Yoo could not explain how he intended to get the family’s money and later detailed his remorse.\n\nThe former instructor, whose students called him Master Lion, did not look at the victims’ family and other supporters as they sobbed in the court’s public gallery after the sentence was handed down.\n\n“These killings were horrific and violent acts, senselessly cruel and cynical, perpetrated without a trace of human compassion,” the judge said.\n\nWhile the crimes were planned — with Yoo surveilling the family’s home beforehand — he made no attempt to conceal his crimes from the CCTV cameras in his academy or try to conceal the bodies.\n\nAt a sentence hearing in November, the judge heard Yoo had lied about meeting the wealthiest Australian, Gina Rinehart, qualifying for the Sydney Olympics in 2000, owning a Lamborghini luxury car and living in Sydney’s wealthy eastern suburbs.\n\nTo impress his own wife, he would send emails to himself, pretending to be important people. He sometimes used the title professor.\n\nHarrison noted that Yoo had told a psychologist his lies became bigger and bigger as his wife and students asked more questions.\n\nThe judge noted Yoo had been burdened since childhood with unrealistic expectations from his parents and South Korean culture about the level of success he needed to achieve.\n\nYoo was handed a box of tissues as the judge described his deep remorse for the hurt and pain that he had caused.\n\nIn a letter to the judge, Yoo said he was “held captive by sin” and that he wanted to give himself to Jesus Christ.\n\n“I wish I could turn back time so this didn’t happen,” Yoo wrote. “I pray every day for the people I have hurt.”\n\nYoo’s lawyers had argued that he should be given a minimum nonparole period rather than a life sentence without possibility of release. The maximum penalty for someone convicted of murder in New South Wales is life imprisonment, with a standard nonparole period of 20 years for the murder of an adult and 25 years for the murder of a child.",

(AP) — A judge on Monday disbarred Hunter Biden in Connecticut for violating the state's attorney conduct rules, a decision that comes after complaints were made about the federal gun and tax charges Biden was convicted of before being pardoned last year by his father, former President Joe Biden.\n\nIn an agreement with the state office that disciplines lawyers, Hunter Biden consented to being disbarred and admitted to attorney misconduct, but he did not admit to any criminal wrongdoing.

He agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor and felony charges hours after jury selection was set to begin.\n\nThe Connecticut judge found that Hunter Biden violated several ethical rules for lawyers, including engaging in conduct “involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\" In a court document, Hunter Biden admitted to some but not all of the misconduct allegations. The judge also cited the Washington disbarment.\n\nPaul Dorsey, one of the two people who filed the complaints about the former president's son, told the judge during Monday's hearing that he objected to the agreement because Hunter Biden did not admit to committing crimes. But Leanne Larson, an attorney with the Office of Chief Disciplinary Counsel, cited the pardon.\n\nHunter Biden was admitted to the Connecticut bar in 1997, a year after graduating from Yale Law School.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration said in a court filing Monday that the president’s White House ballroom construction project must continue for unexplained national security reasons and because a preservationists' organization that wants it stopped has no standing to sue.\n\nThe filing was in response to a lawsuit filed last Friday by the National Trust for Historic Preservation asking a federal judge to halt President Donald Trump's project until it goes through multiple independent reviews and a public comment period and wins approval from Congress.\n\nThe administration's 36-page filing included a declaration from Matthew C. Quinn, deputy director of the U.S. Secret Service, the agency responsible for the security of the president and other high-ranking officials, that said more work on the site of the former White House East Wing is still needed to meet the agency’s “safety and security requirements.” The filing did not explain the specific national security concerns; the administration has offered to share classified details with the judge in a private, in-person setting without the plaintiffs present.\n\nThe East Wing had sat atop a emergency operations bunker for the president.\n\nQuinn said even a temporary halt to construction would “consequently hamper” the agency's ability to fulfill its statutory obligations and its protective mission.\n\nA hearing in the case was scheduled for Tuesday in federal court in Washington.\n\nThe government’s response offered the most comprehensive look yet at the ballroom construction project, including a window into how it was so swiftly approved by the Trump administration bureaucracy and its expanding scope.\n\nThe filings assert that final plans for the ballroom have yet to be finalized despite the continuing demolition and other work to prepare the site for eventual construction. Below-ground work on the site continues, wrote John Stanwich, the National Park Service’s liaison to the White House, and work on the foundations is set to begin in January. Above-ground construction “is not anticipated to begin until April 2026, at the earliest,” he wrote.\n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation did not respond to email messages seeking comment.\n\nThe privately funded group last week asked the U.S. District Court to block Trump's project.\n\n“No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever — not President Trump, not President Biden, and not anyone else,” the lawsuit states. “And no president is legally allowed to construct a ballroom on public property without giving the public the opportunity to weigh in.”\n\nTrump had the East Wing torn down in October as part of his plan to build an estimated $300 million, 90,000-square-foot (27,432-square-meter) ballroom able to accommodate about 1,000 people before his term ends in January 2029. He says presidents before him long have wanted an event space larger than the rooms currently at the White House, and says the ballroom would end the practice of entertaining visiting foreign dignitaries in large, temporary pavilions on the south grounds.\n\nThe Trust asserts that the plans should have been submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission, the Commission of Fine Arts and Congress before any action was taken. The lawsuit notes that the Trust wrote to those entities and the National Park Service on Oct. 21, after East Wing demolition began, urging a stop to the project and asking the administration to comply with federal law, but received no response.\n\nThe lawsuit cites several federal statutes and rules detailing the role the planning and fine arts commission and lawmakers play in U.S. government construction projects.\n\nThe administration argued in its response that the president has the authority to modify the White House and included the extensive history of changes and additions to the Executive Mansion since it was built more than 200 years ago. It also asserted that the president is not subject to the statutes cited by the plaintiffs.\n\nDepartment of Justice attorneys said in the filing that the plaintiff's claims about the East Wing demolition are “moot” because the tear-down cannot be undone. The administration also argues that claims about future construction are “unripe” because the plans are not final.\n\nThe administration also contends that the Trust cannot establish “irreparable harm” because above-ground construction is not expected until spring. It argues that the reviews sought in the lawsuit, consultation with the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, “will soon be underway without this Court's involvement.”\n\nTrump's ballroom project has prompted criticism in the historic preservation and architectural communities, and among his political adversaries, but the lawsuit is the most tangible effort thus far to alter or stop his plans for an addition that itself would be nearly twice the size of the White House before the East Wing was torn down.\n\nIn 2000, the National Park Service's Comprehensive Design Plan for the White House first identified the need for a larger event space to address an increase in visitors and to provide a venue suitable for major events, according to the administration's filing.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge expressed skepticism about a pair of lawsuits that victims of Jeffrey Epstein had filed against two banks, suggesting he may dismiss them before they have a chance to go to trial.\n\nAt the outset of a Monday afternoon hearing in Manhattan federal court, US District Judge Jed Rakoff unfavorably compared the lawsuits against Bank of America and BNY Mellon to two similar lawsuits he had previously overseen, against JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank. JPMorgan agreed to settle the case for $290 million. Deutsche Bank agreed to settle for $75 million.\n\nRakoff said the language in the lawsuits against Bank of America and BNY Mellon — which were brought by the same attorneys and filed in October — was \"frequently conclusory\" and appeared to lack sufficient detail to demonstrate what the banks did wrong. He called the lawsuits \"a model of high-pitched rhetoric.\"\n\n\"'Knows' without saying by whom is vague. 'Affiliated' without saying what that means is vague,\" Rakoff told David Boies, an attorney who brought the case. \"A lot of that language is in the complaint.\"\n\nAt the end of the hearing, Rakoff gave the lawyers who brought the lawsuits on behalf of Epstein victims — David Boies, Sigrid McCawley, Brad Edwards, and Brittany Henderson — two weeks to revise their cases with more specific details about their allegations.\n\nThe judge said they would be permitted to use material they had already gathered as part of the discovery process in the case, but should put a hold on additional depositions and subpoenas until he issued a ruling, which he said could come at the end of January.\n\nThe lawsuits allege that Bank of America and BNY Mellon aided in Epstein's sex-trafficking operation by providing him with banking services and then ignoring red flags tied to his transactions.\n\nEpstein, a well-connected financier, killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on criminal sex-trafficking charges. One of his associates, Ghislaine Maxwell, is serving a 20-year prison sentence for trafficking girls to him.\n\nMonday's hearing was scheduled for the judge to weigh motions to dismiss the two lawsuits outright.\n\nCharlotte Taylor, an attorney at the law firm Jones Day representing Bank of America, argued the lawsuits consisted of \"recycled boilerplate allegations\" and that they could not prove the bank provided anything other than \"routine banking services\" to Epstein and his associates. Felicia Ellsworth, an attorney at WilmerHale, said the plaintiffs couldn't prove anyone at BNY Mellon had the \"state of mind\" to be found liable.\n\nBoies told Rakoff that the banks should have noticed enough smoke around the transactions from bank accounts belonging to Epstein and his associates to know there was a fire. Aside from Epstein's 2008 criminal conviction in Florida, he had been dogged by civil litigation for years, Boies said.\n\nRakoff expressed skepticism that the pattern of facts alleged in the lawsuit would be enough.\n\n\"Last I checked, that's not enough to survive a motion to dismiss,\" Rakoff said. \"You need to have enough allegations as to specific facts.\"\n\nFollowing the hearing, lawyers for the Epstein victims appeared eager to revise their lawsuits and include the information they obtained through the discovery process. Rakoff said that material may be redacted on the public docket.\n\n\"I think he's giving us a chance,\" Sigrid McCawley, an attorney at Boies Schiller Flexner, told Business Insider.",

But time has been unusually unkind to the US supreme court decision that upheld the law banning TikTok, the short-form video platform. The court issued its ruling less than a year ago, but it is already obvious that the deference the court gave to the government’s national security arguments was spectacularly misplaced. The principal effect of the court’s ruling has been to give our own government enormous power over the policies of a speech platform used by tens of millions of Americans every day – a result that is an affront to the first amendment and a national security risk in its own right.\n\nCongress passed the TikTok ban in 2023 citing concerns that the Chinese government might be able to access information about TikTok’s American users or covertly manipulate content on the platform in ways that threatened US interests. The ban was designed to prevent Americans from using TikTok starting in January 2025 unless TikTok’s China-based corporate owner, ByteDance Inc, sold its US subsidiary before then.\n\nMany first amendment advocates and scholars – including the two of us – expected the court to be intensely suspicious of the law. After all, TikTok is one of the most popular speech platforms in the country, and banning foreign media is a practice usually associated with the world’s most repressive regimes. Even more damningly, a long list of legislators forthrightly acknowledged that their support for the ban stemmed not only from general concerns about what users might see on the app but from a desire to suppress specific kinds of content – especially videos showing the devastation caused by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza and other content deemed to be sympathetic to Palestinians. For laws that affect speech, motivations like that are usually fatal.\n\nBut the justices upheld the ban – unanimously – in a thin and credulous opinion issued just a week after oral argument. Apparently untroubled by legislators’ censorial motivations, the court said the law could be justified by privacy concerns, and it accepted without serious scrutiny the government’s argument that the ban was necessary to protect users’ data.\n\nPrivacy and security experts had told the court that banning TikTok would not in fact meaningfully constrain China’s ability to collect Americans’ data, and that if the government wanted to address legitimate privacy concerns online it could do so without so dramatically curtailing Americans’ free speech rights. But the court said that it was not the court’s job to second-guess the executive branch’s decisions about national security and foreign affairs.\n\nThis is not how the first amendment is supposed to work. For one thing, courts are not supposed to close their eyes when the government says it wants to control what people can say or hear. A law motivated by a desire to suppress particular categories of content – to suppress “misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda”, as the House committee report on the bill put it – should at the very least be subject to stringent review.\n\nAnd courts are not supposed to allow the government to side-step that review simply by declaring that national security requires censorship. That is the central lesson of the last hundred years of first amendment doctrine.\n\nDuring the first Red Scare, courts allowed the government to use the Espionage Act to imprison hundreds of activists for nothing more than opposing the war. The cases from that time are regarded as stains on first amendment history, and modern first amendment doctrine evolved as a reaction against these mistakes. Courts are supposed to have learned that it is their job to protect the democratic process by being skeptical of purported national security justifications for suppressing speech.\n\nEvents since the Supreme Court upheld the TikTok ban have only underscored why the justices were wrong to defer to the government’s arguments. The court issued its ruling on 17 January because the ban was meant to go into effect two days later. But even after the court rushed to judgment, Donald Trump issued an order saying he would suspend enforcement of the law for 75 days.\n\nSince then, he has extended this suspension four more times without any legal basis—and he may extend it again. Meanwhile, TikTok remains freely available. Legislators who were insistent that TikTok poses an urgent threat to American security cannot be reached for comment. All of this makes a mockery of the government’s earlier claims that TikTok was an urgent national security risk – and of the court that deferred to those claims.\n\nEven worse, the court’s decision means that TikTok now operates under the threat that it could be forced offline with a stroke of the president’s pen. Conservatives and liberals alike have expressed concerns for years about government officials using threats to “jawbone” social media companies into changing their content-moderation policies, but no previous administration has enjoyed the power to extinguish a platform simply by enforcing existing law.\n\nWhether TikTok is already conforming its policies to Trump’s preferences – as many American universities, media companies and law firms have been doing – is difficult to know. Even if the platform is not conforming now, though, it may well in the future, because Trump has been brokering a deal to have the platform transferred to his ideological allies.\n\nPlainly, the court cannot be blamed for all of this. It could not have predicted that President Trump would simply refuse to enforce the law. Still, we could have avoided this ending if the court had not bungled the beginning. If the court had carefully scrutinized the government’s national security arguments, it would have seen that the TikTok ban, for all of its novelty, is actually just a familiar example of the government exploiting national security fears to intimidate courts into giving it power that the constitution puts off limits.\n\nThe court would have understood that the ban itself created a serious national security risk – the kind of risk the modern first amendment was intended to prevent – by giving the government far-reaching influence over public discourse online.\n\nOver the coming months, the supreme court will confront other cases in which the government invokes national security to justify the suppression of speech. The court’s analysis of those cases should be haunted by the TikTok case and its embarrassing, scandalous coda. We need the court to play its constitutionally appointed role – and not simply defer credulously to political actors deploying the rhetoric of national security in the service of censorship.\n\nEvelyn Douek is an assistant professor at Stanford Law School\n\nJameel Jaffer is inaugural director of the Knight first amendment institute at Columbia University",

    "fullText": "However, Apple can collect ‘appropriate’ fees from external App Store links, says court.\n\nHowever, Apple can collect ‘appropriate’ fees from external App Store links, says court.\n\nApple has lost its appeal of a massive district court ruling in its ongoing antitrust dispute with Epic Games.\n\nThat April ruling from Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said that Apple “willingly” failed to comply with a 2021 order allowing mobile app developers to link to payment options outside of Apple’s, and she barred Apple from charging a commission on in-app purchases using external payment links, among other restrictions. In today’s opinion, the three-judge Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel largely affirmed Gonzalez Rogers’ contempt findings and the limits on Apple. But it asked the judge to consider options that would let Apple charge reasonable fees for external link purchases.\n\nGonzalez Rogers’ ruling took issue with a series of moves Apple made to discourage developers from using external payment methods, including adding a 27 percent fee for external payments, requiring developers to restrict links to plain text instead of allowing them to make buttons, and showing users a fullscreen warning when they tapped an external link. The appeals court agreed that “Apple claimed to comply with the injunction, but it instead prohibited developers from using buttons, links, and other calls to action without paying a prohibitive commission to Apple, and it restricted the design of the developers’ links to make it difficult for customers to use them.”\n\nBut the appeals court ruling said Gonzalez Rogers had gone too far in one area: prohibiting Apple from collecting any fee on in-app purchases from developers. “Rather than coercing Apple to comply with the spirit of the Injunction with a reasonable, non-prohibitive commission, the district court used blunt force to ban all commissions, abusing its discretion,” according to the opinion.\n\nThe panel has recommendations about an “appropriate commission or fee limitation,” including that Apple charge based on the necessary costs for “its coordination of external links for linked-out purchases.”\n\nThe opinion also says that while Apple can’t force developers to make their own options less visible or appealing than Apple’s default, it can restrict developers from placing buttons, links, or “other calls to action” in “more prominent fonts, larger sizes, larger quantities, and more prominent places than Apple uses for its own buttons, links, or other calls to action.”\n\nApple and Epic didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department violated the constitutional rights of a close friend of James Comey and must return to him computer files that prosecutors had hoped to use for a potential criminal case against the former FBI director, a federal judge said Friday.\n\nThe ruling from U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly represents not only a stern rebuke of the conduct of Justice Department prosecutors but also imposes a dramatic hurdle to government efforts to seek a new indictment against Comey after an initial one was dismissed last month.\n\nThe order concerns computer files and communications that investigators obtained years earlier from Daniel Richman, a Comey friend and Columbia University law professor, as part of a media leak investigation that concluded without charges. The Justice Department continued to hold onto those files and conducted searches of them this fall, without a new warrant, as they prepared a case charging Comey with lying to Congress five years ago.\n\nRichman alleged that the Justice Department violated his Fourth Amendment rights by retaining his records and by conducting new warrantless searches of the files, prompting Kollar-Kotelly to issue an order last week temporarily barring prosecutors from accessing the files as part of its investigation.\n\nThe Justice Department said the request for the return of the records was merely an attempt to impede a new prosecution of Comey, but the judge again sided with Richman in a 46-page order Friday that directed the Justice Department to give him back his files.\n\n“When the Government violates the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures by sweeping up a broad swath of a person’s electronic files, retaining those files long after the relevant investigation has ended, and later sifting through those files without a warrant to obtain evidence against someone else, what remedy is available to the victim of the Government’s unlawful intrusion?” the judge wrote.\n\nOne answer, she said, is to require the government to return the property to the rightful owner.\n\nThe judge did, however, permit the Justice Department to file an electronic copy of Richman's records under seal with the Eastern District of Virginia, where the Comey investigation has been based, and suggested prosecutors could try to access it later with a lawful search warrant.\n\nThe Justice Department alleges that Comey used Richman to share information with the news media about his decision-making during the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. Prosecutors charged the former FBI director in September with lying to Congress by denying that he had authorized an associate to serve as an anonymous source for the media.\n\nThat indictment was dismissed last month after a federal judge in Virginia ruled that the prosecutor who brought the case, Lindsey Halligan, was unlawfully appointed by the Trump administration. But the ruling left open the possibility that the government could try again to seek charges against Comey, a longtime foe of President Donald Trump. Comey has pleaded not guilty, denied having made a false statement and accused the Justice Department of a vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Comey saga has a long history.\n\nIn June 2017, one month after Comey was fired as FBI director, he testified that he had given Richman a copy of a memo he had written documenting a conversation he had with Trump and had authorized him to share the contents of the memo with a reporter.\n\nAfter that testimony, Richman permitted the FBI to create an image, or complete electronic copy, of all files on his computer and a hard drive attached to that computer. He authorized the FBI to conduct a search for limited purposes, the judge noted.\n\nThen, in 2019 and 2020, the FBI and Justice Department obtained search warrants to obtain Richman's email accounts and computer files as part of a media leak investigation that concluded in 2021 without charges. Those warrants were limited in scope, but Richman has alleged that the government collected more information than the warrants allowed, including personal medial information and sensitive correspondence.\n\nIn addition, Richman said the Justice Department violated his rights by searching his files in September, without a new warrant, as part of an entirely separate investigation.\n\n“The Court further concludes that the Government’s retention of Petitioner Richman’s files amounts to an ongoing unreasonable seizure,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote. “Therefore, the Court agrees with Petitioner Richman that the Government has violated his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures.”",

    "fullText": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia must be freed from immigration detention while he fights his deportation, a judge ruled Thursday, handing a major victory to the immigrant whose wrongful deportation to a notorious prison in El Salvador made him a flashpoint of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement to let Abrego Garcia go immediately, writing that federal authorities had detained him again after his return to the United States without any legal basis.\n\n“For this reason, the Court will GRANT Abrego Garcia’s Petition for immediate release from ICE custody,” the judge wrote.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security sharply criticized the decision and vowed to appeal, calling the ruling “naked judicial activism” by a judge appointed during the Obama administration.\n\n“This order lacks any valid legal basis, and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary. The judge gave prosecutors until 5 p.m. EST to formally respond to the release order.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment, and messages seeking comment from Abrego Garcia’s attorney were not immediately returned.\n\nAbrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national with an American wife and child, has lived in Maryland for years but entered the U.S. illegally as a teenager. An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that he could not be deported to El Salvador because he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family. When he was mistakenly sent there in March, his case became a rallying point for those who oppose President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement actions.\n\nA court later ordered his return to the United States. Since he cannot be removed to El Salvador, ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries. His federal suit claims the Trump administration is illegally using the removal process to punish Abrego Garcia for the public embarrassment caused by his deportation.\n\nIn her order releasing Abrego Garcia, Xinis wrote that federal authorities “did not just stonewall” the court, “They affirmatively misled the tribunal.” The judge was referencing the successive list of four African countries that officials had sought to remove Abrego Garcia seemingly without commitments from those countries, as well as officials' affirmations that Costa Rica withdrew its offer to accept him, a claim later proven untrue.\n\n“But Costa Rica had never wavered in its commitment to receive Abrego Garcia, just as Abrego Garcia never wavered in his commitment to resettle there,” the judge wrote.\n\nXinis also rejected the government’s argument that she lacked jurisdiction to intervene on a final removal order for Abrego Garcia, because she found no final order had been filed.\n\nSeparately, Abrego Garcia is asking an immigration court to reopen his case so he can seek asylum in the United States.\n\nHe is also criminally charged in Tennessee, where he has pleaded not guilty to human smuggling. He has asked the federal court to dismiss the case, arguing the prosecution is vindictive. His defense attorney in Tennessee, Sean Hecker, declined to comment.\n\nA judge in that case has ordered an evidentiary hearing after previously finding some evidence that the charges “may be vindictive.” The judge also noted several statements by Trump administration officials that “raise cause for concern,” including a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that seemed to suggest the Justice Department charged Abrego Garcia because he won his wrongful deportation case. ___\n\nLoller reported from Nashville, Seewer reported from Toledo, Ohio and Lauer reported from Philadelphia.

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge has allowed a Tufts University student from Turkey to resume research and teaching while she deals with the consequences of having her visa revoked by the Trump administration, leading to six weeks of detention.\n\nThe arrest of Rümeysa Öztürk, a PhD student studying children's relationship to social media, was among the first as the Trump administration began targeting foreign-born students and activists involved in pro-Palestinian advocacy. She had co-authored an op-ed criticizing her university’s response to Israel and the war in Gaza. Caught on video in March outside her Somerville residence, immigration enforcement officers took her away in an unmarked vehicle.\n\nÖztürk has been out of a Louisiana immigrant detention center since May and back on the Tufts campus. But she's been unable to teach or participate in research as part of her studies because of the termination of her record in the government's database of foreign students studying temporarily in the U.S.\n\nIn her ruling Monday, Chief U.S. District Judge Denise J. Casper wrote that Öztürk is likely to succeed on claims that the termination was “arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law and in violation of the First Amendment.”\n\nGovernment argued that termination was legal\n\nThe government’s lawyers unsuccessfully argued that the Boston federal court lacked jurisdiction and that Öztürk’s Student and Exchange Visitor Information System record (SEVIS) record was terminated legally after her visa was revoked, making her eligible for removal proceedings.\n\n“There’s no statute or regulation that’s been violated by the termination of the SEVIS record in this case,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Sauter said during a hearing last week. The Associated Press sent an email Tuesday seeking comment from Sauter on whether the government plans to appeal.\n\nIn a statement, Öztürk, who plans to graduate next year, said while she is grateful for the court's decision, she feels “a great deal of grief” for the education she has been “arbitrarily denied as a scholar and a woman in my final year of doctoral studies.”\n\n“I hope one day we can create a world where everyone uses education to learn, connect, civically engage and benefit others — rather than criminalize and punish those whose opinions differ from our own,” said Öztürk, who is still challenging her arrest and detention.\n\nThe then-30-year-old was one of four students who wrote the opinion piece in the campus newspaper. It criticized the university’s response to student activists demanding that Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel.\n\nÖztürk, who is Muslim, was meeting friends in March for iftar, a meal that breaks a fast at sunset during Ramadan, according to her lawyer, Mahsa Khanbabai. Her student visa had been revoked several days earlier, but she was not informed of that, her lawyers said. The government asserted that terminating her SEVIS record two hours after her arrest was a proper way of informing Tufts University about her visa revocation.\n\nA State Department memo said Öztürk's visa was revoked following an assessment that her actions “‘may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization’ including co-authoring an op-ed that found common cause with an organization that was later temporarily banned from campus.”\n\nÖztürk running out of time to pursue teaching, research goals\n\nWithout her SEVIS status reinstated, Öztürk said she couldn't qualify as a paid research assistant and couldn't fully reintegrate into academic life at Tufts.\n\n“We have a strange kind of legal gaslighting here, where the government claims it’s just a tinkering in a database, but this is really something that has a daily impact on Ms. Öztürk’s life,” her attorney, Adriana Lafaille of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, said in court.\n\n“We are running out of time to make this right. Each day that goes by is a day that she is being prevented from doing the work that she loves in the graduate program that she came here to be part of. Each day that this happens is a day that the government is allowed to continue to punish her for her protected speech.”\n\nÖztürk, meanwhile, has maintained a full course load and fulfilled all requirements to maintain her lawful student status, which the government hasn't terminated, her lawyer said.\n\nRecord created to collect information on international students\n\nSEVIS is mandated by Congress in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 and administered by the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement “to collect information relating to nonimmigrant foreign students” and “use such information to carry out the enforcement functions of” ICE.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, when a SEVIS record is terminated, a student loses all on and/ or off-campus employment authorization and allows ICE agents to investigate to “confirm the departure of the student.”\n\nMcCormack reported from Concord, New Hampshire.",

    "fullText": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin judge on Tuesday refused to step aside as requested by President Donald Trump's former attorney who faces felony forgery case related to the 2020 election in the battleground state.\n\nThe judge also refused to cancel a Monday preliminary hearing for Trump's former attorney, who also previously worked as a judge in the same county where he is being prosecuted, and two other former Trump associates.\n\nThe three former Trump aides face 11 felony charges each in relation to their roles in the 2020 fake elector scheme. They are: Jim Troupis, who was Trump’s attorney in Wisconsin in the 2020 election; Kenneth Chesebro, an attorney who advised Trump's campaign; and Mike Roman, Trump’s director of Election Day operations in 2020.\n\nTroupis, joined by the other two defendants, argued in a motion filed Monday that all of the judges in Dane County were biased against him. Troupis was a judge in the county for one year from 2015 to 2016.\n\nHe also alleged that the judge hearing his case, Dane County Circuit Judge John Hyland, had solicited help from a retired judge in writing an August order refusing to dismiss the case against him.\n\nTroupis argued in the motion that the retired judge who “carries personal animus” toward Troupis from their time together on the bench actually wrote the order. Troupis asked for an evidentiary hearing in another county.\n\nHe included an expert analysis of the writing style that compares the order to the writing style of retired Dane County Judge Frank Remington. Troupis' attorney also attached a Nov. 25 letter he wrote to Hyland claiming that other attorneys told him that Remington actually wrote the August order because the writing style matched Remington’s in a civil case they litigated before him.\n\nHyland rejected those arguments and Troupis' call for moving the case to another county.\n\n“The Court is satisfied that no person other the assigned staff attorney and I had a hand in drafting or editing the decision which this Court signed and entered,” Hyland wrote.\n\nHyland also wrote that he had “no personal animus or prejudice toward any of the litigants” and was satisfied that he could fairly hear the case. He declined to step aside as requested.\n\nHyland also said that Troupis presented no evidence to support his claim that every other judge in the country was prejudiced against him and therefore can’t fairly hear the case.\n\nTroupis’ attorney, Joe Bugni, did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nTroupis, Chesebro and Roman each face 11 felony charges for allegedly using forgery in an attempt to defraud each of the 10 Republican electors who cast their ballots for Trump in 2020 as part of a plan to submit paperwork falsely claiming that the Republican had won the battleground state that year.\n\nTrump lost Wisconsin in 2020 but fought to have the defeat overturned. He won the state in both 2016 and 2024.\n\nThe Wisconsin Department of Justice, which is prosecuting the case, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe state charges against the Trump attorneys and aide are the only ones in Wisconsin. None of the electors have been charged. The 10 Wisconsin electors, Chesebro and Troupis all settled a lawsuit that was brought against them in 2023.\n\nFederal prosecutors who investigated Trump’s conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, said the fake electors scheme originated in Wisconsin.\n\nThe Wisconsin complaint details how Troupis, Chesebro and Roman created a document that falsely said Trump had won Wisconsin’s 10 Electoral College votes and then attempted to deliver the document to then-Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nThe Trump associates have argued that no crime took place. But the judge in August rejected their arguments in allowing the case to proceed.\n\nA judge threw out a similar case in Michigan in September. And last year, a special prosecutor dropped a federal case alleging Trump conspired to overturn the 2020 election. A Georgia election interference case was dropped by prosecutors earlier last month, and another similar case remains in Nevada.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge investigating whether Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem should face a contempt charge over flights carrying migrants to El Salvador said Monday he wants to hear from a whistleblower and top Justice Department official.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington ordered the government to make Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign available for testimony on Dec. 16. Boasberg wants to hear a day earlier from fired Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni.\n\nThe order for testimony ratchets up the extraordinary clash between the judicial and executive branches.\n\nIn March, Boasberg ordered the Republican administration to turn around two planes carrying Venezuelan migrants.\n\nInstead, the planes landed in El Salvador hours later, touching off the contempt probe. Boasberg is trying to determine whether the administration willfully ignored his order and should be referred for prosecution on a contempt charge.\n\nReuveni has filed a whistleblower complaint alleging a Justice Department official suggested the Trump administration might have to ignore court orders as it prepared to deport Venezuelan migrants it accused of being gang members. The administration has said the allegations are untrue.\n\nThe Justice Department has said Ensign conveyed Boasberg’s oral order and a subsequent written order to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIn a written declaration submitted to the court Friday, Noem said she made the decision not to return the planes to the U.S. after receiving “privileged legal advice” from the Homeland Security Department’s acting general counsel and “through him from the senior leadership of the Department of Justice.”\n\nBoasberg, who was nominated to the federal bench by President Barack Obama, a Democrat, called Noem’s declaration “cursory.”\n\n“As this declaration does not provide enough information for the Court to determine whether her decision was a willful violation of the Court’s Order, the Court cannot at this juncture find probable cause that her actions constituted criminal contempt,” the judge wrote in Monday's order.\n\nThe administration has said it did not violate Boasberg’s order. The judge’s directive to return the planes was made verbally in court but not included in his written order, government attorneys said in a court filing in November.\n\nThat order blocked the administration from removing “any of the individual Plaintiffs from the United States for 14 days,” but said nothing about the flights already airborne, they said.\n\nThe two planes had already departed U.S. territory and airspace, so the migrants aboard them had already been “removed” and therefore fell outside of the court’s order, Justice Department lawyers said in the court filing.\n\nJustice Department attorneys in a court filing Friday objected to any “live testimony,” urging Boasberg instead to “proceed promptly” with a criminal contempt referral if he believed his order was “sufficiently clear in imposing an obligation to halt the transfer of custody for detainees who had already been removed from the United States.”",
