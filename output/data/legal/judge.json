A new YouGov poll surveying 1,931 U.S. adults found that 60 percent approved of the ruling. In a 6-3 ruling on Friday, the Supreme Court determined that Trump overstepped his authority by imposing sweeping global tariffs without congressional approval.",

    "fullText": "Levi Colwill’s absence has been hard to ignore during the 2025/26 campaign, with Chelsea noticeably lacking his composure and defensive presence. There’s still no clear timeline for when he’ll be back on the pitch.\n\nColwill suffered an ACL injury on the very first day of pre-season training, having only been given a short break following a busy summer.\n\nChelsea’s Club World Cup involvement, which ended in victory, left them with little time to recover. Injuries have since affected several key players, including Cole Palmer, Romeo Lavia and Liam Delap.\n\nSince taking over as manager, Liam Rosenior hasn’t had the chance to use the England international and it’s affected his ability to establish a consistent back two.\n\nBobby Vincent asked Rosenior if Colwill might play for Chelsea this season, and the manager expressed hope that he would.\n\nHe said: “I’m hopeful. I’m hopeful because he’s an outstanding player. Again, no time frames. You have to take these long-term injuries day by day. And also, it’s not about when he comes back, it’s about him staying fit when he is back.”\n\nChelsea have had a history of bringing players back too quickly from injuries, something many point to as a reason behind Reece James and Lavia’s repeated issues.\n\nColwill is also in talks over a new contract at Chelsea, which only adds to his motivation to get back on the pitch as soon as possible.\n\nChelsea made it their mission to sign a new centre-back in January, with their efforts to bring in Jeremy Jacquet not successful.\n\nDespite recalling Mamadou Sarr and having the impending return of Aaron Anselmino, reports have not disappeared that they would be interested in signing a new centre-back.\n\nThe club are seemingly looking at all options at present though before committing once again.\n\nFIFA looks to expand Club World Cup, but Chelsea haven’t even qualified yet\n\nBlueCo set to change direction with new Chelsea transfer policy\n\nMoises Caicedo explains why Liam Rosenior impressed him instantly",

    "description": "Marc Bowker, a small business owner, said Trump continues to cause uncertainty for small businesses after Supreme Court tariff ruling.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Marc Bowker, owner of Alter Ego Comics, a comic book shop in Lima, Ohio, after the Supreme Court overturned some of President Donald Trump's tariffs. This story has been edited for length a clarity.\n\nMy first reaction to the Supreme Court decision was, \"This is awesome and long overdue.\" The second was, \"Okay, what's next?\"\n\nThen I saw the president say there would now be a new 10% global tariff and that the Supreme Court justices who ruled against him are unpatriotic and unloyal. So it feels like this is going to drag on forever and ever until he gets his way. It's like death by a thousand paper cuts.\n\nI think there are more questions remaining than answers. I appreciate the Supreme Court siding with Americans and American businesses, but it feels like it's going to be a tug-of-war that may go on throughout this entire administration.\n\nThis administration has created a level of uncertainty in the small business landscape that I haven't seen in 23 years of owning my store.\n\nIn addition to being a small-business owner in America, I'm a consumer in America, so I'm paying more for everything that my family consumes, from food to physical products. It's a one-two punch for us.\n\nI've kept a spreadsheet of every shipment that had a tariff charge, and as of today, we've paid over $12,000 since Trump started all of this.\n\nWe've had to pass on a percentage of that to our customers, and as a result, we've seen a slowdown in orders. Some are taking a wait-and-see mentality, or they just don't want to pay the extra fee.\n\nComics themselves — a lot of which are printed in Canada — have not been impacted by tariffs. But for me and for other comic book stores, action figures, board games, and comic book supplies, like storage items, are being impacted. Action figures account for about 65% of my shop's revenue, and they are made in China.\n\nA lot of these orders are made far in advance, too. We were being charged tariffs on items ordered in 2023 and 2024. There's stuff I need to order next week that ships in June of 2027. Is the tariff going to be 6%? Is it going to be zero? Is it going to be 100%? I have no idea.\n\nAs for the tariff costs small businesses have already paid, are we getting that back? Probably not. Are the corporations that paid the bulk of the tariffs going to be reimbursed? Where does that come from? I feel like this is just going to cause more paperwork, more red tape, more headaches. I don't know what the next step is.\n\nIf I could wave a magic wand, yes, there would be some reimbursement of the fees that all American businesses have had to pay. If I had to settle for something, it would be that, effective today, there are no more of these Trump tariffs.\n\nIt's hard to be excited about the Supreme Court ruling when, within hours, the White House says it's going to push back with more tariffs.\n\nThe administration is throwing so much at us every day that we can't make any progress. It's hard to see what the future will look like.\n\nI would hate to see this stretch on the next three years of the administration. It's going to take all this extra time that could be spent running our businesses and serving our customers, just trying to stop the government from getting its hands in our pockets.\n\nIt really feels like our elected officials are not listening to us. Historically, the Republican Party has been promoted as the party of business in the United States. If they truly were, they would be listening to constituents who are saying these tariffs are hurting our businesses.",

    "description": "America's supply-chain bosses are experiencing a fresh bout of uncertainty after Friday's tariff ruling by the Supreme Court.",
    "fullText": "Friday's tariff ruling has once again put America's supply-chain bosses in a bind.\n\nMany made strategic changes after the levies were announced last year, and the new ruling — plus Trump's strong reaction to it — are now clouding their path forward. With the commander in chief fighting back, COOs must decide whether to proceed as if the court's decision is impenetrable or wait to see if the White House can successfully keep the tariffs intact.\n\n\"Tariffs are written in DC, and they're felt in the COO's inbox,\" Jason Schloetzer, a professor at Georgetown's McDonough School of Business, told Business Insider. \"It's kind of an impossible job.\"\n\nIn a news conference held shortly after the ruling, Trump lashed out at the court's justices who sided against him, saying they should be \"absolutely ashamed\" and accusing them, without evidence, of being \"swayed by foreign interests.\" He also said \"alternatives\" would be used to preserve his trade agenda and that he'd tap a separate authority to impose a 10% global tariff on top of existing tariffs.\n\n\"President Trump has been abundantly clear: Tariffs are here to stay, and the America Last era of American workers being ripped off is over,\" White House Spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. \"The Administration will be pursuing other legal authorities to maintain President Trump's America First trade and economic agenda while continuing to implement a pro-growth agenda of tax cuts, deregulation, and energy abundance.\"\n\nTrump's alternative was announced Friday night. Trump signed a proclamation that would implement a temporary 10% import surcharge for 150 days, starting on February 24, under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. The executive order also carved out exemptions for certain categories, including critical minerals and some agricultural products.\n\nAny strategies Trump deploys will likely face legal and other hurdles that could take months to resolve, said Schloetzer. In the meantime, \"COOs will just press the pause button\" on decisions involving sourcing, factory locations, labor, and other expenses, he added.\n\nMany companies are still grappling with the impact of actions they took last year to cope with Trump's tariff hikes, said Rob Lalka, who teaches entrepreneurship at Tulane University.\n\nFor example, he said that some companies responded by raising prices on consumer goods, which in turn affected people's spending habits and opinions of those businesses.\n\n\"That disruption is something you can't reverse,\" he said.\n\nNow, with the fate of Trump's tariffs up in the air, COOs are experiencing the kind of whiplash that can be debilitating, said Lalka, especially for those at startups and small businesses with limited resources.\n\n\"They're the ones who are often working with the thinnest margins,\" he said.\n\nFriday's ruling could also benefit companies financially through refunds. The Supreme Court ruled that the federal government illegally collected more than $133 billion in taxes from American businesses.\n\nYet while business groups such as the US Chamber of Commerce and the National Retail Federation hailed the court's decision, Trump administration officials have suggested that issuing refunds would be a messy process.\n\nFor now, the burden of figuring out how to keep operations humming will fall largely on COOs, said Schloetzer.\n\n\"CEOs can always focus on talking about long-term strategies, and CFOs can focus on modeling what these things might mean for margins,\" he said. \"But COOs actually have to be the ones in the short-term that are delivering.\"\n\nThose in manufacturing have it particularly bad, he added, because such companies may need to move components across multiple countries.\n\n\"It really is difficult to think through what the margin implications would be,\" said Schloetzer. \"They've got to just be pulling their hair out.\"\n\nBrian Smith, COO of Omni Containment Systems, an Elgin, Illinois, manufacturer of HVAC cleaning systems, is feeling the heat.\n\n\"It's very frustrating … because of the journey that we just went on for one year in altering our import-export strategies,\" he said.\n\nOmni, which imports goods from Spain and exports to Canada, lost sales last year due to the Trump administration's tariffs, Smith said. The company managed, however, and Smith said he thought \"things had kind of stabilized\" in recent months.\n\n\"This will take us right back to where we were in the first and second quarter of last year, which was complete uncertainty,\" he said.\n\nSmith added that it's hard to know how this will play out with suppliers and buyers.\n\n\"We're going to have to have some conversations with our larger customers who buy multiple machines and discuss what influence this is going to have,\" he said.\n\nAnother unknown he's wrestling with is whether a refund is headed Omni's way for the tariffs the company has paid to date.\n\n\"What are they going to do with all the money they collected?\" said Smith of the payments that the federal government illegally collected from US businesses, per the Supreme Court's decision. \"If they could just answer that question, it would be helpful either way.\"",

    "description": "The watch world is rejoicing over the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tariffs as dealers say the prices of pre-owned Swiss watches could dip.",
    "fullText": "The watch world breathed a collective sigh of relief over the Supreme Court's decision on President Donald Trump's trade policy.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision on Friday, the court ruled that imposing most of Trump's tariffs exceeded his authority under a 1970s law. The ruling is a hefty blow to the policies he put in place against foreign countries, which companies have had to reckon with for nearly a year.\n\nWatch dealers have told Business Insider that they and their shoppers stand to benefit from the ruling. Pre-owned watch retailer SwissWatchExpo CEO Eugene Tutunikov said it would likely lead to lower pre-owned watch prices in the next six months — he expects declines of 2% to 3%. Without tariffs looming overhead, the market is poised to snap back faster than retail prices as sellers set their prices and buyers take the deals.\n\n\"Supply will loosen up, and purchasing power goes right back to the collector where it belongs,\" Tutunikov said.\n\nA break from tariffs would make the entry point for luxury watch collecting more accessible.\n\nCue the celebrations among Swiss watch lovers who've been caught in a storm of retail price increases from leading brands like Rolex over the past year. Supply chain constraints also made it harder to do business in the secondhand market.\n\nTariff tensions between Switzerland and the US have been up and down since Trump's Liberation Day. US imports of Swiss goods faced a baseline tariff of 10% from April 2025 until Trump eventually raised it to 39%, sending shockwaves through the watch industry. The two countries continued negotiations until Trump agreed to lower the rate to 15% after speaking with Rolex and other Swiss companies.\n\nTrump clapped back at the nation's highest court over its Friday ruling, saying he'd find alternative ways to keep his trade agenda intact.\n\n\"The Supreme Court did not overrule tariffs. They merely overruled a particular use of IEPPA tariffs,\" Trump said, citing the law referenced in the court's ruling.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court's move is still a win in the books of watch dealers who've said the decision would allow pricing in the pre-owned market to return to being based on value and demand rather than tariffs.\n\n\"If they are indeed lifted, we expect it would meaningfully improve sentiment across the industry, increase access to important pieces, and ultimately benefit collectors, retailers, and brands alike,\" said Joshua Ganjei, CEO of European Watch Company, which sells pre-owned and vintage watches.",

Following the announcement, Jefferies analysts highlighted five stocks that they say have the \"largest upside benefit\" on the court's decision.\n\n\"The removal of IEEPA tariffs introduces a meaningful margin tailwind across our consumer discretionary coverage,\" the analysts wrote.\n\n\"While the ruling eliminates the legal authority for these tariffs, questions remain around remedies—most notably whether companies will be entitled to refunds for duties already paid,\" they added.\n\nHere are five stocks that Jefferies sees as best-positioned to gain after the SCOTUS tariff decision.\n\nJefferies analysts said Signet Jewelers is a primary beneficiary of the tariff decision.\n\nThe company sources roughly half of its inventory from India since the country is a global hub for both natural and lab-grown diamonds.\n\nWith the SCOTUS ruling, Signet Jewelers' weighted‑average tariff exposure falls to 0% from 15.1%, creating an opportunity for margin expansion and earnings growth, Jefferies analysts wrote.\n\nPrior to the SCOTUS ruling, Yeti had a nearly 15% exposure to tariff-related sources, concentrated in its US revenue.\n\nThe company told investors there was a $0.35 earning per share impact from the IEEPA tariffs, meaning that the decision will eliminate tariff pressures going forward.\n\nSharkninja proactively mitigated tariff impact by diversifying its supply chain, supply concessions, strategic pricing, and promotions.\n\nEven with these efforts, the company still saw tariff-related margin headwinds.\n\nSCOTUS's decision will turn this pressure into a benefit for the company, as the already successful operational shifts, along with the removal of the tariffs, will further boost earnings.\n\nNike embedded a 7.7% tariff exposure into its fiscal 2026 guidance. This would have amounted to a $1.5 billion cost for the athletic wear company.\n\n\"The elimination of IEEPA tariffs now flips this dynamic into a margin tailwind, supporting incremental gross margin expansion through FY26,\" Jefferies wrote.\n\nBirkenstock worked a nearly 7% weighted‑average tariff impact into their guidance.\n\nThe SCOTUS news turns the margin headwind into a tailwind to fuel outperformance compared to the company's outlook, Jefferies said.",

JB Pritzker sent a letter to Trump calling for refunds to families in his state.\n\n\"Your tariff taxes wreaked havoc on farmers, enrage our allies, and sent grocery store prices through the roof,\" Pritzker said in the letter. \"On behalf of the people of Illinois, I demand a refund of $1,700 for every family in Illinois.\"\n\nThe governor also sent an invoice billing that amount for more than 5.1 million Illinois families, totaling more than $8.6 billion. The invoice said it was \"PAST DUE - DELINQUENT.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment, White House spokesman Kush Desai responded in part by saying if Pritzker \"really cared about delivering economic relief for Illinois, he'd start with his own state government instead of chasing another stupid headline.\"\n\nThe offices of Newsom and Pritzker did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBoth Newsom and Pritzker are considered potential candidates for the presidential election in 2028, and they've both been highly critical of Trump.\n\nThe governors appeared to be basing their requests for refunds of that amount on a report released this month by Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee in Congress. The report found American families paid an average of $1,745 in tariff costs between February 2025 and January 2026, for a total of over $231 billion paid by consumers.\n\nOther studies, including from Harvard Business School and The Budget Lab at Yale, have found that tariff costs are largely paid by American businesses and consumers.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday ruled that tariffs issued under the IEEPA, a national security act, had exceeded the president's authority. Trump denounced the decision and said he would pursue additional tariffs through other avenues.\n\nIn November, Trump touted the money being collected from tariffs and floated the idea of sending $2,000 tariff dividend checks to middle and low-income Americans, though issuing such checks would likely have required an act of Congress. In January, Trump gave mixed messages about his plans for tariff rebate checks.\n\nNow, with the IEEPA tariffs struck down, it's likely some American businesses will try to receive refunds for the tariff costs they paid.\n\nDespite Democrats' stance on the issue, there's a lot of uncertainty about whether or how refunds would happen.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling did not touch on issuing tariff refunds.\n\nWhen Trump was asked Friday if the government would now have to issue refunds, he said, \"I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years.\"\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Friday it was \"unlikely\" Americans would receive tariff refunds.\n\n\"I got a feeling the American people won't see it,\" Bessent said, adding, \"My sense is that could be dragged out for weeks, months, years.\"",

    "description": "The court heard arguments last year on whether Trump exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) when imposing tariffs on goods from virtually every US trading partner.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court scrambled the US trade landscape Friday when it struck down the centerpiece of President Trump’s second-term tariff program, ruling 6-3 that his sweeping blanket tariffs are illegal.\n\nThe ruling came just over one year into Trump’s second term and after skeptical questioning from key justices during oral arguments last November and appears set to immediately halt a massive section of Trump’s tariffs. Those tariffs were first announced last year on “Liberation Day” using a 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).\n\n“IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs,” read the decision, written by Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nTrump attacked the high court in his first response Friday, particularly the justices in the majority, saying they were a \"disgrace to our nation.\" He hinted that the administration would pursue alternative methods toward implementing its trade goals.\n\nThe ruling also raised the question of refunds, which could return an estimated $129 billion to importers in the months ahead. It upholds two lower courts — including the US Court of International Trade — that previously found Trump did not have the authority to impose global tariffs using the 1977 law.\n\nThe decision will likely have wide-ranging ramifications, affecting global trade, consumers, companies, inflation and the pocketbooks of every American. In recent weeks, Trump has already made plans to roll back some tariffs on metals, including on steel and aluminum goods, as he and his administration seek to battle an affordability crisis ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nThe US Supreme Court changed the US trade agenda on Friday, ruling that blanket tariffs are illegal and striking down President Trump's most sweeping tariffs.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision, the court held that the 1977 International Emergency Powers ACT (IEEPA) does not give Trump the authority to impose taxes without approval from Congress.\n\nThis ruling will mean that much of the administration's current tariff agenda will be brought to a halt, especially those tariffs first announced in April last year, on what has come to be known as Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.\n\nToday, economists at Penn-Wharton said that over $175 billion in tariff revenue may need to be refunded if the Supreme Court rules against Trump's tariffs.\n\nHowever, according to SCOTUSblog, the court mentioned nothing about whether the government should go about returning the billions of dollars it made from importers.\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas, Brett Kavanaugh, and Samuel Alito all dissented.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh, in his dissent, said, \"The United States may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers who paid the IEEPA tariffs, even though some importers may have already passed on costs to consumers or others.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court majority that struck down President Trump's ability to issue blanket tariffs on US trading partners did not address the issue of refunds — that is, will companies be able to get them for the duties they paid ... that are now ruled unconstitutional?\n\nThough the Supreme Court majority didn't address it, the dissenting minority did. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who authored the dissent, noted that the process could be a \"mess\" for the US Treasury to navigate.\n\nAfter the US Supreme Court struck down President Trump's tariffs, what are his options?\n\nTrump himself has said previously that the law he used to implement the tariffs is an essential tool in his toolbox. But other members of the administration have suggested that the White House could simply rebuild his tariff regime through other — albeit more cumbersome — methods.\n\nThe Associated Press has a good rundown of his options:\n\nThey run through them all here — read more.\n\nUS stocks rose in the immediate aftermath of the Supreme Court's decision to strike down President Trump's most sweeping tariffs. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led gains.\n\nSectors with more exposure to tariffs saw a bigger bounce. The Dow Jones Transportation Average (^DJT) popped around 1%. Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) saw outsize gains, as did Stanley Black & Decker (SWK).\n\nHead over to our markets blog for full coverage of the stock market's reaction to the ruling.\n\nNovartis (NVS) CEO Vas Narasimhan met with President Trump at the White House on Wednesday, where the president said the company is set to build 11 plants in the US.\n\nTrump hit Switzerland with 39% tariffs last year, but then agreed to cut the duties to 15% in November. Last month, Novartis said it expected to be protected from tariffs under some agreements with the US and strong domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe Trump administration is pushing back on claims from the New York Federal Reserve that US consumers and businesses are bearing the brunt of higher costs due to President Trump's tariffs.\n\n\"The paper is an embarrassment,\" National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think it's the worst paper I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nHowever, data from the JPMorgan Chase Institute, released Thursday, also found that tariffs paid by midsize US businesses tripled in 2025.\n\nYahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports on the latest news on Trump's tariffs:\n\nJapan plans to invest up to $36 billion in US oil, gas, and critical mineral projects, part of Tokyo's $550 billion commitment under the trade agreement it struck with President Trump last year.\n\n“Our MASSIVE Trade Deal with Japan has just launched!” Trump posted on Tuesday on social media. “The scale of these projects are so large, and could not be done without one very special word, TARIFFS.”\n\nJapan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said that the projects will help build more resilient supply chains through partnerships in crucial areas for economic security.\n\nThe Supreme Court has added next Friday, Feb. 20, as a decision day, the first time in weeks it could potentially issue a verdict on the closely watched case involving President Trump's tariffs.\n\nNext Friday is listed as a non-argument session and conference day on the high court's calendar.\n\nThe high court heard arguments on the tariff case in November on an expedited basis, and both liberal- and conservative-leaning justices asked skeptical questions about Trump's authority to impose the tariffs.\n\nThe duties at issue are Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, in which the president slapped levies ranging from 10% to 50% on imports from virtually all US trading partners. The Trump administration has said a defeat at the Supreme Court would only prompt it to impose the duties via other legal means — though Trump himself has said those processes would be more cumbersome and has implored the court to uphold the tariffs.\n\nOn Wednesday night, President Trump pressured House Republicans to support his tariffs, even though rising living costs have upset many voters.\n\nWhile six Republicans voted against his current tariffs on Canadian goods, 210 others remained loyal to Trump. But experts say this could harm them in the upcoming midterm elections, as many voters remain concerned about rising prices.\n\nA report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York argues that Americans are paying for almost all of the additional costs from President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nPresident Trump's tariffs faced a rebuke on Wednesday as the US House of Representatives voted to pass a resolution seeking to terminate the national emergency measures Trump used to impose tariffs on Canada. Six Republicans voted with Democrats to scrap Trump's tariffs against the US's neighbor.\n\nYahoo Finance's Washington Correspondent Ben Werschkul outlines the outcome of yesterday's vote by the US House of Representatives and what it means for Trump's tariffs:\n\nThe US and Japan are nearing the completion of the first of three projects that Tokyo agreed to fund as part of its $550 billion investment in the US and tariff agreement.\n\nBloomberg reports that the three projects include a data center led by SoftBank Group Corp. (9984.T), a deep-sea oil terminal in the Gulf of Mexico, and semiconductors.\n\nAccording to the report, SoftBank didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nConfusion over the trade deal between the US and India emerged on Wednesday after the White House adjusted language around agricultural goods.\n\nIn the updated statement, the US has removed a reference to pulses, a staple food in India that includes lentils and chickpeas.\n\nIn the old version, the statement says that India will remove tariffs on \"certain pulses\", whereas in the new version, the word \"pulses\" has been removed. The old version also says India is \"committed to buying more American products,\" whereas the new statement says \"... intends to buy...\"\n\nThe countries appear to have made other changes to the statement, too.\n\nThe US House of Representatives will vote on Wednesday on whether to reject some of President Trump's tariffs. The vote comes months ahead of the midterm elections, at a time when many Americans are concerned about the rising cost of living.\n\nToday's vote will start with a resolution to stop Trump's tariffs on Canada, which currently include a 35% tariff on imported items such as steel, aluminum, and copper, as well as a 25% duty on non-US cars. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the free trade agreement Trump has threatened to scrap, does exempt some of these goods.\n\nThe House vote will proceed despite Speaker Mike Johnson's attempt to block it.\n\nTrump has there would be no extra cost to the American people. A report from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation has found that these tariffs will amount to an average tax increase per US household of $1,000 in 2025 and $1,300 in 2026.\n\nThe Financial Times reports that the Trump administration is planning to exempt hyperscalers Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and Microsoft (MSFT) from forthcoming chip tariffs as Big Tech races to build data centers to power artificial intelligence.\n\nMexico is trying to send fuel to Cuba to prevent a power collapse, but it is searching for a way to do this without being hit by tariffs from the US.\n\nWashington has threatened tariffs on any country that attempts to help Cuba by supplying fuel.\n\nCuba has been under a 60-year embargo from the US dating back to the 1960s.\n\nEstee Lauder (EL) shares slumped 10% before the bell on Thursday, despite beating analysts' estimates on earnings per share and revenue, but tariff woes caused the beauty group's shares to tumble.\n\nThe Trump administration will be launching a $12 billion \"emergency warehouse\" for critical minerals needed to build cars, phones, and jets. The plan will include buying and storing these minerals now. The US hopes this will reduce its and other countries' reliance on China for supplies.\n\nThe critical mineral's stockpile news was released on Monday, and Vice President JD Vance plans to deliver a keynote speech on Wednesday at a meeting with the Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials from Europe, Asia, and Africa.\n\nThe Trump administration said on Tuesday that it plans to reduce India's tariffs on American industrial goods to zero from 13.5%, but will allow India to protect its farmers from foreign competition.\n\nThe US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer made the statement a day after President Trump agreed to reduce tariffs on New Delhi, claiming India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to stop purchasing Russian Oil.\n\nTrump hit India with 50% tariffs last year, 25% of which was a penalty for purchasing Russian oil, which Trump claimed was helping to fund the war in Ukraine.\n\nPresident Trump announced Monday that the \"reciprocal\" tariff rate on goods from India would drop to 18% from 25%, but that announcement underplayed the extent of the tariff reduction in evidence Monday in what the president described as a trade deal between the two nations.\n\nA White House official confirmed that, in addition to the reduction Trump outlined, the White House is also planning to drop a separate tariff of 25% on Indian goods over its Russian oil purchases, which previously amounted to a 50% tariff on Indian goods.\n\nThe new total tariff rate of 18% was what Prime Minister Narendra Modi quickly touted in his own social media post after the call with Trump, offering “Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India” but not outlining any of the changes on his end, which Trump listed.\n\nTrump said Monday that India had agreed to stop buying Russian oil and also reduce their tariffs and non-tariff barriers against the United States \"to ZERO.\"\n\nPresident Trump on Monday said the US and India had agreed to a trade deal after he spoke with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nTrump said the baseline US tariff rate on goods from India would drop to 18% from 25%. The US president also claimed that Modi had \"agreed to stop buying Russian Oil.\" India is also currently facing an additional 25% \"secondary\" tariff on its purchases of Russian oil.\n\n\"Our amazing relationship with India will be even stronger going forward,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nModi also agreed to buy American products \"at a much higher level,\" Trump said.\n\nThe apparent US deal with India comes as US trade partners are clinching long-negotiated deals in a rebuke to the Trump tariff regime. India and the EU announced a trade deal last week that the EU dubbed the \"mother of all deals,\" which came after years of negotiations between the two sides.\n\nPresident Trump is planning to launch a $12 billion minerals stockpile, according to Bloomberg News, in a bid to counter the US's reliance on China for rare earth materials.\n\nThe initiative has been dubbed Project Vault and will combine $1.67 billion in private capital with a $10 billion loan from the US Export-Import Bank. It is hoped that this venture will help acquire and store minerals for automakers, tech companies and other manufacturers.\n\nRare earth materials are key components used in a variety of products, such as smartphones, cars and rechargeable batteries. China has the largest reserve of rare earths and last year restricted exports of the materials due to Trump's tariffs. In November, China lifted the restrictions as part of a one-year trade truce with the US.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that her country will look for alternate ways to help Cuba, including \"diplomatic\" solutions after President Trump signed an order to levy tariffs on countries that supply Cuba with oil, Reuters reported. Mexico is one of the last nations that supplies Cuba with oil.\n\nThe US trade deficit — the value of imports minus the value of exports — swung wider in November as trade continued to shift in response to the Trump administration's tariff policies.\n\nPresident Trump's global tariffs have failed to stop Toyota Motors (TM), the Japanese car company said on Thursday that it had sold a record 11.3 million vehicles globally in 2025.\n\nToyota Motors will retain its position as the world's top-selling automaker in 2025, and its recent sales growth has come despite Trump's aggressive tariff policies.\n\nTrump initially imposed 25% tariffs on Japanese automakers but reduced them to 15% after reaching a deal with Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.\n\nThe stock rose 2% during early trading on Thursday.",

    "description": "A federal judge threw out on Wednesday an administrative board's decision endorsing the Trump administration's policy of subjecting thousands of people arrested",
    "fullText": "Feb 18 (Reuters) - A federal judge threw out on Wednesday an administrative board's decision endorsing the Trump administration's policy of subjecting thousands of people arrested during its immigration crackdown to mandatory detention.\n\nU.S. District ‌Judge Sunshine Sykes in Riverside, California, vacated the decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals after finding the ‌administration had failed to comply with her earlier order declaring unlawful the underlying policy of denying detainees the chance to seek release on bond.\n\nSykes' Wednesday ruling, ​in a class action lawsuit that covers migrants nationwide, is more sweeping than decisions by hundreds of other U.S. judges holding the policy is unlawful and ordering detainees to be freed or given bond hearings.\n\nSykes, appointed by former Democratic President Joe Biden, called the administration's actions \"shameless\" and accused it of trying to continue its \"campaign of illegal action\" by still refusing bond hearings despite her prior ruling.\n\n\"Respondents ‌have far crossed the boundaries of constitutional ⁠conduct,\" Sykes wrote.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Justice, which oversees the board, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSykes' ruling means the board's decision can ⁠no longer be used by immigration judges to deny bond hearings, said Niels Frenzen, a professor at the University of Southern California's Gould School of Law who represented the plaintiffs.\n\n\"We hope that DHS and the immigration courts will now comply with the court's orders to ​provide ​bond hearings to the thousands of noncitizens who have been arrested,\" he ​said in a statement.\n\nFederal immigration law prescribes mandatory ‌detention for \"applicants for admission\" to the United States, while their cases proceed in immigration courts and they are ineligible for bond hearings.\n\nBucking a long-standing interpretation of the law, the DHS last year - as part of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown - took the position that non-citizens already residing in the United States, and not only those who arrive at a port of entry at the border, qualify as applicants for admission.\n\nThe Board of Immigration Appeals, which is part of the Justice Department, issued a decision ‌in September that adopted that interpretation, leading to immigration judges nationally employed ​by the department to mandate detention.\n\nSykes in a ruling in December declared ​the DHS policy unlawful but stopped short of vacating ​the board's decision.\n\nBut she said it was clear further relief was needed after Chief Immigration Judge Teresa ‌Riley issued guidance instructing her colleagues that they ​are not bound by Sykes' ruling ​and that they should continue following the board's decision.\n\nThose immigration judges are employed by the Justice Department.\n\nSykes, in Wednesday's decision, criticized DHS for repeatedly and inaccurately suggesting that operations by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement were limited to targeting ​criminal non-citizens who were the \"worst of the ‌worst.\"\n\n\"Maybe that phrase merely mirrors the severity and ill-natured conduct by the government,\" Sykes wrote. \"Even though these press ​releases might contain an inkling of truth, they ignore a greater, more dire reality.\"",

    "description": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in Los Angeles about social media's impact on youth. The judge cracked down on smart glasses in court.",
    "fullText": "As Mark Zuckerberg was ushered into the Los Angeles Superior Court early on Wednesday morning, one accessory in his entourage stood out: Meta Ray-Ban glasses.\n\nZuckerberg, wearing a navy blue suit and tie, arrived without any glasses. Flanking either side of him as he walked up to the courthouse were longtime executive assistant Andrea Besmehn and an unidentified man donning Meta's Ray-Ban glasses.\n\nMeta declined to comment about the accessory choice.\n\nAI-powered smart glasses weren't just a hot accessory in the California sun. They were a hot topic inside the courtroom.\n\nThe judge presiding over the trial announced that anyone using glasses to record inside the courtroom would be \"held in contempt of the court,\" according to CNBC.\n\nThis isn't the first trial where Meta's glasses have caused issues.\n\nLast year, while Meta battled the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust allegations, New York Times reporter Mike Isaac posted on X (formerly Twitter) that he had been reprimanded by the court for wearing Meta Ray-Bans.\n\ndo not wear camera glasses in federal buildings folks 😞\n\nThe glasses cameo came as Zuckerberg took the stand in a Los Angeles trial accusing major social media companies of building addictive products that harm young users. The case centers on a now-20-year-old plaintiff, identified in court filings as \"KGM,\" who alleged that Instagram and YouTube worsened her depression and suicidal thoughts after she started using the apps as a child. TikTok and Snap have already settled, leaving Meta and Google's YouTube as the remaining defendants in the trial, which could shape similar lawsuits nationwide.\n\nThe trial underway in Los Angeles is focused on design features that plaintiffs say keep teens scrolling. Zuckerberg's testimony follows an earlier appearance from Instagram chief Adam Mosseri.\n\nMeta's Ray Ban smart glasses have become a surprise hit. On the company's earnings call last month, Zuckerberg said that sales of the glasses more than tripled in 2025, and compared the moment to the shift from flip phones to smartphones.\n\nMeta has increasingly positioned the glasses as a vehicle for its AI ambitions. In addition to taking pictures and playing music, users can ask questions to Meta AI, Meta's AI assistant, about anything that they're looking at through the glasses.\n\nLast week, the New York Times reported that Meta is planning to add facial recognition technology to the glasses.",

    "fullText": "ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — A judge on Tuesday granted a request for a hearing to learn more about an investigation that led to charges against former University of Michigan football coach Sherrone Moore, who was arrested soon after he was fired for a relationship with his executive assistant.\n\nIt's a victory for Moore and lawyer Ellen Michaels who is defending him against charges of felony home invasion, stalking and illegal entry. They ultimately want the case dismissed.\n\nMoore, 40, is accused of entering the woman’s apartment without permission and threatening to kill himself in front of her on Dec. 10. Authorities quoted him as saying she was to blame for him losing one of the top college football jobs in the country. She had spoken to university officials.\n\nJudge J. Cedric Simpson expressed concern that a police detective didn’t disclose Moore's employer-employee relationship with the woman — a “glaring omission” — when a magistrate authorized a warrant for his arrest.\n\n“Defendant’s due process may have been violated,” Simpson said.\n\n\"This was not solely this personal relationship. The magistrate should have been able to look at that,\" said the judge, who set a March 2 hearing to hear from police and other witnesses.\n\nThe woman ended the personal relationship a few days before Moore's firing and did not answer a dozen calls or respond to some text messages from him before his dismissal, police said.\n\nMichaels said a coach calling and texting an executive assistant that many times was reasonable while Moore was preparing his team for a bowl game.\n\n“It’s not stalking if the communication has a legitimate purpose,” Michaels said.\n\nBefore Simpson set the hearing, Washtenaw County assistant prosecutor Kati Rezmierski said it wasn't necessary and would be outside the judge's discretion.\n\nMoore coached the Wolverines for two seasons as the successor to Jim Harbaugh, who won a national championship before quitting to become coach of the NFL’s Los Angeles Chargers. Kyle Whittingham, who coached Utah for two decades, is Michigan’s new coach.\n\nMichaels accused the woman's personal lawyer of giving information to police to “villainize Mr. Moore and maximize the chances of obtaining a large settlement from the deep pockets of the University of Michigan.”",

    "fullText": "The Trump administration suffered a stinging defeat on Presidents Day after a Bush-appointed judge ruled against it while citing the dystopian novel 1984.\n\nU.S. District Judge Cynthia Rufe ruled on Monday that an exhibit about nine people enslaved by George Washington be reinstated after the Trump administration ordered its removal last month.\n\nThe National Park Service removed the exhibit from Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia in response to an executive order from Trump that was aimed at “restoring truth and sanity to American history.” The order instructed the Interior Department to ensure that the nation’s museums, parks and landmarks do not display anything that “inappropriately disparage Americans past or living.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House and the National Park Service for comment.\n\nNews cameras and onlookers recorded staff removing the exhibit late last month, with one park employee reportedly telling the Philadelphia Inquirer, “I’m just following my orders.”\n\nThe exhibit was located at the President’s House site in Philadelphia, where George and Martha Washington lived along with nine people enslaved by the couple when the city was briefly the nation’s capital.\n\nRufe ruled that all materials must be restored in their original condition while a lawsuit challenging the legality of the removal filed by Philadelphia mayor Cherelle Parker plays out.\n\nTrump’s executive order, issued on March 27, 2025, and titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” stated that, “Over the past decade, Americans have witnessed a concerted and widespread effort to rewrite our Nation’s history, replacing objective facts with a distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.”\n\n“This revisionist movement seeks to undermine the remarkable achievements of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light.”\n\nIn her ruling, Rufe referenced George Orwell’s 1984, writing, “As if the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell’s 1984 now existed, with its motto ‘Ignorance is Strength,’ this Court is now asked to determine whether the federal government has the power it claims — to dissemble and disassemble historical truths when it has some domain over historical facts.”\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to whitewash history at multiple historical sites around the country, including removing a pride flag from the Stonewall National Monument in New York City just last week and erasing references to transgender people on the National Park Service’s website for the monument.\n\nReferences to the dispossession and mistreatment of Native Americans were also removed from an exhibit at Grand Canyon National Park, and roadside displays addressing climate change, pollution and mining were also flagged for potential removal.\n\nSenior vice president of government affairs for the National Parks Conservation Association Kristen Brengel told the Washington Post that the White House’s efforts should “offend every American.”\n\n“We are capable of hearing about our tragedies and our victories, and this systematic erasure should concern everyone in our country.”\n\nMS NOW’s Rachel Maddow celebrated the ruling on the Monday night edition of her show, quoting extensively from the ruling—noting that Rufe was appointed by Republican President George W. Bush—and telling viewers, “Happy Presidents’ Day, Philadelphia. You are getting your history put back up by court order at the President’s House.”",

    "fullText": "Another heavy defeat for Wales. Yet another record loss at the Principality Stadium.\n\nIt is hard to judge Welsh rugby results these days after Steve Tandy's side suffered a 54-12 thrashing by France in Cardiff. It is just the same old story as they now turn their attention to the visit of Scotland next Saturday.\n\nWales suffered more misery as Les Bleus romped to an eight-try victory with the hosts wilting again for a 13th straight Six Nations defeat.\n\nFrance transformed a Test match into an exhibition of carefree rugby as the visitors claimed their biggest Six Nations triumph in the Welsh capital.\n\nHome hammerings have become the norm with Wales having conceded 50 points on more than five occasions in under a year at the Principality Stadium.\n\nArgentina, South Africa, England and France have all achieved record wins in Cardiff in the past 11 months, while Wales have now suffered 10 successive Six Nations home losses in a sequence that stretches back four years.\n\nLowest Cardiff Six Nations crowd amid rugby turmoil\n\nCan anyone stop 'massive favourites' France in Six Nations?\n\nWelsh rugby is in continued disarray and has suffered a new lowest ever Six Nations crowd for Cardiff, as supporters begin to vote with their feet.\n\nFrench fans took over the Principality Stadium and Welsh rugby bosses should be grateful they attended in such numbers.\n\nGiven all of this, you might have expected to see a dejected Welsh response after the game. Witnessing the players in another losing huddle after even more heartbreak is tough to watch.\n\nWales coach Tandy tried to remain positive, viewing it as an improvement on the opening 48-7 defeat by England - correct, although coming from a very low bar.\n\nThere should not be much cause for optimism but Wales are desperately trying to find it as they cite a better set-piece and discipline.\n\n\"We are disappointed with the scoreline but there was \n\n\"I know you're all looking at me like I'm stupid, with the path we're on, but there were glimpses with the set-piece and intent of how we wanted to go after the game.\n\n\"There was enough where we can go back on Tuesday and work on things.\n\n\"It's not the scoreline we want but it's part of the journey we're on. Every nation is at different stages.\n\n\"We've got to focus on the things we did better, like discipline, and recognise there's areas we need to grow.\"\n\nThis was the fifth time in six games under Tandy that Wales have shipped more than 40 points.\n\nThere have been 302 points and 42 tries conceded during Tandy's tenure, an average of 50 points and seven tries per game.\n\nWales have now lost 23 out of the previous 25 Test matches since the 2023 World Cup.\n\nSo Tandy was asked how he could justify any positivity to fans who had witnessed Wales suffer another heavy defeat.\n\n\"I'm a coach, I understand as well,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"Most people see the outcome and people will comment on things without always seeing the data.\n\n\"I've got an understanding of where we are. We've got young players and combinations coming in, we have to go through and experience it.\"\n\nTandy insists his view is an optimistic one.\n\n\"I knew the challenge that it was, coming into Wales,\" he added.\n\n\"It excites me about where we can go. Hopefully we can look back in 18 months time or whenever it is, and this was a part of it.\n\n\"We can't click our fingers and be one of the best in the world. It's a process.\"\n\nTandy also pointed to Wales having played the top four ranked sides in the world in the past four matches, with those losses against New Zealand, South Africa, England and France.\n\n\"There's also the context of the six games we've played,\" said Tandy, whose solitary win came against Japan with the last kick of the game.\n\n\"If you look at the teams we're playing, not that it's an excuse for the numbers of points we're conceding, we're playing ruthless sides.\n\n\"So there has to be an understanding of who we're playing. We know where we want to be as a team, but also know where we are.\n\n\"We're 11th in the world and have won two in 20-plus games.\"\n\nThe former Ospreys coach insists patience is required, stressing improvements \"won't come overnight\".\n\n\"For me as a coach, it's seeing where we are growing,\" outlined Tandy.\n\n\"You might not see the bits adding together but I believe it when I'm seeing the training week, with the mindset of the boys and how they keep coming back.\n\n\"We've got some young kids and it'll take time.\"\n\nTandy accepted it was demoralising to concede more than 50 points again at home.\n\n\"That's where we're at this time,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"We've conceded lots of yellow cards and points.\n\n\"It's not an effort-based thing. There's things we need to tidy up.\n\n\"It's something we're working hard to address.\"\n\nThe former Scotland and Lions defence coach insisted there is a balance to getting everything right as a team.\n\n\"It's at the forefront of what we're trying to do but with the game at the minute, there are more points being scored than before.\n\n\"With the way it's being refereed, you get on the wrong side of them and it can rack up pretty easily.\n\n\"It's something we're working hard to address. We're not going to win games by conceding 50 points.\n\n\"We're keen to address and build confidence in what we're trying to do.\"\n\nWales captain Dewi Lake agreed with Tandy's assessment that his side had delivered an improved performance against France.\n\n\"It's weird to say looking at the scoreline but we were much better than we were last week for large parts of that game,\" claimed Lake.\n\n\"France are a team near the top of the world and can create things out of absolutely nothing.\n\n\"They scored some world-class tries and have some world-class individuals.\n\n\"We know there's things to mop up but we won't hide away from that fact, or that we're disappointed with the scoreboard.\n\n\"But, all in all, we were much more positive.\"\n\nLake says the character of his squad cannot be questioned.\n\n\"The boys are never going to give up on a result or a Test match or a ball on the floor, anything like that,\" said Lake.\n\n\"As captain, I don't need to say anything. Those boys are ready to go anyway.\"\n\nWelsh fans will not doubt the players' heart.\n\nThey are, though, right to question the quality of the national squad and the WRU's stewardship of the game in Wales.\n\nRecord defeats are being normalised and the world rugby public are pitying this once proud nation.\n\nThat is where Welsh rugby currently stands. It is hard to be optimistic about that.",

    "fullText": "Ole Miss quarterbacks coach Joe Judge released a statement Saturday after a quote from a court appearance went viral, insisting that his comments about fathers of newborns prioritizing their sleep were \"taken out of context.\"\n\nThe comments were given Thursday during the hearing for Rebels quarterback Trinidad Chambliss' request for an injunction to play a sixth season of college football. That injunction was granted Friday.\n\nOne clip of Judge's testimony took off in particular, in which Judge recounts telling the partners of players with young children that they need to prevent those children from waking them up in the middle of the night.\n\nNEW: Ole Miss coach Joe Judge tells pregnant partners of players during the season that the father has to play good football.\n\n“He needs to be in another room, detached… he ain’t waking up for midnight feedings.” pic.twitter.com/LQG7t0fQtX\n\n— College Transfer Portal (@CollegeFBPortal) February 12, 2026\n\nNotably, that clip identifies Judge as an Ole Miss coach and refers to unspecified players, but what it does not mention is the conversation at the time was about Judge's experience dealing with sleep disorders while in NFL player development with the New England Patriots.\n\nIn his statement, Judge clarified that the conversations about playing football while raising a child were only in the NFL, never the collegiate level:\n\n\"Some of my comments from Thursday have been taken out of context, so l'd like to provide some clarity. In a discussion about Trinidad's sleep apnea, I was trying to point out the importance that the NFL places on sleep for recovery and performance in addition to the education of balancing family dynamics during the football season.\n\n\"These are discussions I was a part of at the professional level from veteran players based on their own experience managing similar situations. These are not discussions we've had at the collegiate level. As a husband and father of four children, I understand those challenges first hand and would never diminish the commitment to family. We share that same dedication to family with our players and always support them through any challenges they face in their personal.\"\n\nJudge worked under Bill Belichick from 2012 to 2019, became head coach of the New York Giants in 2020, then moved back to the Patriots after his firing in 2022. He joined Ole Miss in 2024 and currently holds the titles of quarterbacks coach and \"head coach of offense\" (John David Baker is the offensive coordinator under head coach Pete Golding).\n\nIn the interest of clarity and not taking Judge out of context, here is the larger exchange about dealing with NFL players with sleep disorders:\n\nQ: \"Can a sleep disorder affect a player's ability?\"\n\nQ: \"Has that occurred in your past where you have encountered players with sleep disorders?\"\n\nQ: \"And what did you do for those players?\"\n\nA: \"Well, we got them the CPAP machines. We tracked their sleep. We made sure they were evening out their sleep cycles, that they're properly rested. That was several players over the course of years.\n\n\"And then there was also the players that we would have to educate — this is always a tough conversation to have. It's not a popular opinion, this is the truth, we would have to educate significant others who may have been pregnant during the season, or were going to have a baby during the season, and you'd have to educate them on — you have this baby in the middle of the season, that father has to play good football. It's a day-by-day production business. He has to be ready to perform and go out there and play, and when I say that is, you need to let him sleep. He needs to be in another room, detached.\n\n\"You have to explain to the mother, 'Listen, he ain't waking up for the midnight feedings. After the season, he's full metal jacket. You can do whatever you want with him, he'll change every diaper. In season, he's got to have a different priority.\n\n\"Now, there were examples to use from that. We had some older veteran players — I can or can't share names if you want me too — who had multiple children who would sleep in other rooms. Their wives would bring in family or a nursing aid to help throughout the night, and those players continue to play high-level football. We had other players who are young who quite simply did what every other father in the world does, waking up, changing diapers, doing feedings, and led to injuries, led to soft-tissue injuries, not being rested, not being recovered, not being ready to roll.\"\n\nQ: \"That never occurred to me, that newborns can affect injuries on the football field. But who had to deliver that message?\"\n\nQ: \"And to whom did you deliver the message?\"\n\nA: \"About as good as you'd expect (laughs).\"",

    "description": "Ole Miss assistant coach and former Giants head coach Joe Judge made waves on Thursday with his testimony in the Trinidad Chambliss eligibility case.",
    "fullText": "Ole Miss assistant coach and former Giants head coach Joe Judge made waves on Thursday with his testimony in the Trinidad Chambliss eligibility case. Judge is now trying to put the toothpaste back in the tube.\n\nOn Friday morning, Judge explained to PFT (in a message sent through PFT Live co-host Chris Simms) that his comments about educating spouses and significant others about the importance of letting players get their sleep when a newborn baby is in the house related to his time with NFL players, not college players. On Saturday, Judge provided a more lengthy statement about the distinction on Twitter.\n\n\"Some of my comments from Thursday have been taken out of context, so I'd like to provide some clarity,\" Judge said. \"In a discussion about Trinidad's sleep apnea, I was trying to point out the importance that the NFL places on sleep for recovery and performance in addition to the education of balancing family dynamics during the football season.\n\n\"These are discussions I was a part of at the professional level from veteran players based on their own experience managing similar situations. These are not discussions we've had at the collegiate level. As a husband and father of four children, I understand those challenges first hand and would never diminish the commitment to family. We share that same dedication to family with our players and always support them through any challenges they face in their personal lives.\"\n\nThe most obvious response to Judge's clarification is this: If his comments had no relevance to college athletes, why did he say what he said within the context of testimony in a case about the eligibility of a college football player?\n\nBeyond that, Judge's explanation that he would never diminish the commitment to family ignores the fact that, at the NFL level, he did.\n\nThe bigger point is this. Judge was working with Chambliss's lawyers in an effort to help him secure an extra year of eligibility. Ole Miss wants him back for another year, so that he can help them win as many games as possible. Judge, as a result, said what he believed he needed to say in order to make the case that the sleep issues arises arising from Chambliss's respiratory problem should qualify for a medical redshirt as to his 2022 season at Ferris State.\n\nIt was a strategy, a calculation aimed at helping Ole Mis get the player they want. In lieu of telling Chambliss's lawyers that making the point about shielding NFL players from responsibility to care for newborns during football season was a bridge too far, Judge was all in with whatever it took to help win the case.\n\nJudge is now trying to have it both ways. He made the point he made to help Ole Miss get Chambliss for another year. Now, Judge wants to avoid the consequences of what he said by saying he never said anything like that to college players, only NFL players.\n\nIt would be better for Judge to just accept the win in the Chambliss case and take the heat for what he said. Judge told the court the story about football players and infants and sleep because he thought it would help Ole Miss get Chambliss for the 2026 season. It worked. It's now too late for Judge to try to say he didn't say what he said.",

    "fullText": "The construction of U.S. President Donald Trump’s White House ballroom was halted by a federal judge in mid-February 2026.\n\nAs of this writing, a federal judge has yet to rule on the legal status of the construction project. In a social media post, Trump stated that the project is moving \"ahead of schedule,\" while a White House spokesperson told us that the project is still in the \"demolition phase.\"\n\nA social media rumor that emerged around Feb. 10, 2026, claimed a federal judge had halted U.S. President Donald Trump's White House ballroom construction project.\n\nTrump began the demolition of the White House's East Wing in October 2025 in order to replace it with a 90,000-square-foot ballroom. In December 2025, the nonprofit National Trust for Historic Preservation sued the administration, arguing the project began without necessary approvals or congressional authority.\n\nIn mid-February 2026, numerous readers asked us to confirm whether a federal judge had halted construction on the ballroom. A Feb. 10 Facebook post stated:\n\nTrump's infamous new White House ballroom and bunker has been scrapped by a federal judge and the national trust preservation committee. It was also discovered the $400 million in ballroom donor money has either disappeared or simply never existed. 🤔\n\nThe image of the White House (below) shows the former site of the East Wing, built in 1902 and renovated in 1942, completely demolished with several bulldozers and skip loaders clearing the last of the rubble.\n\nGSA has to now hire a construction company to fill the east wing (trump improperly had demolished) with dirt and sod. The Judge and committee have also ruled trump \"cannot as much as paint a wall in the white house without a permit and committee approval\".\n\nAs of this writing, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon, the judge overseeing the case, had yet to issue a decision on the status of the ballroom construction project. We reached out to the White House; a spokesperson told us the ballroom was not yet being constructed and the project was still in the \"demolition stage.\"\n\nWe therefore rate the claim that a judge has halted the construction as false. We will update the story when the court releases a decision.\n\nThe National Trust argued that the project proceeded without receiving authorization from Congress and with inadequate environmental assessments.\n\nOn Dec. 17, 2025, Leon denied the National Trust's motion for a temporary restraining order on the project and temporarily allowed work to continue. The judge's order noted that because the ballroom plans had not been finalized, there was no \"imminent risk of irreparable aesthetic harm.\"\n\nAccording to arguments filed by the Trump administration in January 2026, previous presidents did not require congressional approval to carry out construction or renovations on White House grounds. The government also said above-ground construction would not begin until April 2026.\n\nIn late January 2026, Leon expressed skepticism that the administration had the legal authority to tear down the East Wing and proceed with construction. However, he said he would make a decision in the coming weeks, likely in February 2026, on whether or not to allow a preliminary injunction, which would stop the construction work for the duration of the case.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg's reporting, Leon predicted the issue would also be appealed to a federal appeals court and possibly the Supreme Court. According to court records viewed on Feb. 12, Leon had not issued such an injunction.\n\nThe White House didn't specify how much money it had raised and who the private donors were, directing us to Trump's most recent statement instead. On Feb. 10, 2026, Trump posted on TruthSocial that the construction project \"is on budget, and ahead of schedule.\" He also shared digital renderings of what the potential ballroom would look like.\n\nOn Jan. 25, Trump posted that the project was privately funded and would cost $300 million to $400 million dollars:\n\nI'm building, on top of everything else that I am doing, one of the greatest and most beautiful Ballrooms anywhere in the World, with more than 300 Million Dollars of Great American Patriots' money, and working closely with, right from the beginning, the United States Military and Secret Service. This is a GIFT (ZERO taxpayer funding!) to the United States of America, of 300 to 400 Million Dollars (depending on the scope and quality of interior finishes!), for a desperately needed space [...]\n\nIn November 2025, the White House released a list of donors for the ballroom project, which included charitable organizations, sports team owners, tech companies, media companies and billionaires. The Associated Press reported an additional corporation as well as an artificial intelligence chipmaker that also donated to the project. The administration did not reveal how much each donor contributed.\n\nSnopes has covered numerous claims on the East Wing demolition and Trump's plans for a White House ballroom.\n\n\"A Crane Used in the Ballroom Construction Hovers above The White...\" Getty Images, 10 Feb. 2026, https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/crane-used-in-the-ballroom-construction-hovers-above-the-news-photo/2260298495.

    "fullText": "RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — A judge sentenced an 18-year-old who acknowledged killing five people in a North Carolina mass shooting to life in prison without parole Friday, rejecting arguments that he deserved the chance for release decades from now.\n\nAustin David Thompson was 15 during the Oct. 13, 2022, attack that began at his Raleigh home when he shot and repeatedly stabbed his 16-year-old brother, James.\n\nEquipped with firearms and wearing camouflage, Thompson then fatally shot four others — including an off-duty city police officer — in his neighborhood and along a greenway. He was arrested in a shed after a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his head.\n\nThompson pleaded guilty last month to five counts of first-degree murder and five other counts less than two weeks before his scheduled trial.\n\nThompson, who did not speak publicly in court, was led away in handcuffs after the sentencing. Family members of the shooting victims cried as the sentence was handed down. Thompson’s attorneys announced plans to appeal the sentence.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Paul Ridgeway had the option to sentence him to life in prison with the chance for parole after at least 25 years, but Thompson did not face the death penalty given his age at the time of the crimes.\n\n“It’s hard to conceive of a greater display of malice,” Ridgeway said after chronicling the events of that day, adding that Thompson's months of planning and fantasizing before the rampage confirmed he is the rare juvenile offender “whose crime reflects irreparable corruption” and thus required a life without parole sentence.\n\nDuring the sentencing hearing that began last week, prosecutors revealed the previously confidential contents of a handwritten note with Thompson’s name and the shooting date found at his family's house in the Hedingham subdivision.\n\nThe note said the “reason I did this is because I hate humans they are destroying the planet/earth,” adding that he killed James Thompson ”because he would get in my way.”\n\nThompson “cannot tell you why he wrote that note the way that he did,” defense lawyer Deonte’ Thomas said, noting that he had no history of ecological-based anger. “And he cannot tell you why he ran down the streets of Hedingham terrorizing people that day.”\n\nBut “he is not unredeemable, he is not incorrigible,” Thomas added in asking Ridgeway to give him the opportunity one day to tell parole commissioners he could “still be a productive person in society.”\n\nThompson's attorneys argued that the rampage happened during a dissociative episode caused by medicine he regularly took for acne. A psychiatrist who interviewed Thompson and a geneticist testified to bolster the explanation, but Ridgeway rejected the theory Friday, saying the facts belied the argument.\n\nThe judge seemed to account strongly for the prosecution's evidence of Thompson’s internet search history leading up to the attack. They said it included school shootings and was related to guns, assaults and bomb-making materials, including details that Ridgeway said appeared to match his deadly actions.\n\nNicole Connors, 52; Raleigh police Officer Gabriel Torres, 29; Mary Marshall, 34; and Susan Karnatz, 49, also were killed in the rampage. Two other people were wounded, including another police officer involved in the search for Thompson.\n\n“In the blink of an eye, everything changed for those people and for the people that they left behind,” Wake County assistant prosecutor Patrick Latour said Thursday while urging a sentence with no potential parole. “And the thing that made it change was not some acne medication. It was the defendant’s knowing, researched, well-thought-out, planned, decisive actions.”\n\nJasmin Torres, the widow of Gabriel Torres and the mother of their 5-year-old daughter, asked Ridgeway last week to sentence Thompson to life without parole, calling him a “monster.”\n\nRob Steele, Marshall's fiance at the time of her death, said after the hearing that while five consecutive sentences of life without parole were “what we were all hoping for,” Thompson still “ended five lives for reasons that I still don’t really understand in this case.”\n\nThompson’s parents testified they couldn’t explain why their son committed the violence, calling him a normal, happy kid who did well in school and showed no signs of destruction.\n\nThompson’s father pleaded guilty in 2024 to improperly storing his handgun that authorities said was found when his son was arrested. He received a suspended sentence and probation.\n\n“We both lost our children, one at the hand of the other. We never saw this coming and still cannot make sense of it,” mother Elise Thompson said last week while telling the families of shooting victims she will “forever be sorry for the pain that this has caused you.”",

    "description": "A federal judge ruled on Tuesday that prosecutors could access the Claude chat transcripts of a finance startup founder accused of fraud.",
    "fullText": "Thinking about using ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity to collect your thoughts for an email to your lawyers? Don't assume your chat will stay confidential.\n\nA federal judge ruled on Tuesday that prosecutors could access Claude chat transcripts generated by Brad Heppner, a finance startup founder accused of defrauding a company out of $150 million.\n\nThe chats occurred after Heppner received a subpoena, hired lawyers, and learned that he was a target of prosecutors, his lawyer said in court.\n\nHeppner, who helped start the finance firm Beneficient, was arrested last year and charged with wire and securities fraud for conduct that allegedly led to the downfall of GWG Holdings.\n\nInvestigators seized \"dozens of electronic devices\" when they arrested Heppner at his Dallas mansion, prosecutors said, and Heppner's lawyers have insisted that 31 chats with Anthropic's Claude bot on those devices are privileged.\n\n\"Mr. Heppner — using an AI tool — prepared reports that outlined defense strategy, that outlined what he might argue with respect to the facts and the law that we anticipated that the government might be charging,\" his lawyer said.\n\n\"The purpose of his preparing these reports was to share them with us so that he could discuss defense strategy with us.\"\n\nEven though Heppner had privileged conversations with his lawyers, Judge Jed Rakoff said he \"disclosed it to a third-party, in effect, AI, which had an express provision that what was submitted was not confidential,\" according to a transcript of the hearing.\n\nThe government noted that Claude's privacy policy specified that chats could be disclosed. Prosecutors also said that the chats couldn't be protected by the \"work product privilege,\" which can guard materials prepared at a lawyer's direction, because Heppner's lawyers didn't ask him to use Claude.\n\nThe decision has lawyers buzzing.\n\n\"My gut reaction is that the decision is directionally correct,\" Moish Peltz, an attorney whose post about the decision ricocheted around X, told Business Insider. \"There's a lot of materials that should be kept as privileged that people are putting into AI.\"\n\nThe proliferation of chatbots where people are inputting sensitive legal information, another wrote, has created \"a discovery nightmare.\"\n\nNoah Bunzl, an employment lawyer, told Business Insider that people might find it \"somewhat shocking\" that their legal confidences could be lost by sharing them with a chatbot.\n\nThe case isn't the first where an executive's use of a chatbot was the subject of legal debate.\n\nIn November, PC Gamer reported on a dispute involving the acquisition of a video-game company, where a company official's use of ChatGPT to try to avoid paying an earn-out was mentioned in court records.\n\nAnd after The New York Times sued OpenAI for allegedly violating its news article copyrights, a judge required OpenAI to retain millions of chat logs to potentially review them for copyright infringement.\n\nBunzl said he has noticed that in civil discovery, lawyers are increasingly asking for their adversary's AI chats. It's \"a whole other world of discoverable information,\" he said.\n\nStill, attorneys at the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton, who analyzed the Heppner decision, said it was the first they were aware of where someone's use of an AI tool may have resulted in \"a loss of privilege\" over privileged material. They said courts may view businesses' use of purpose-built AI tools differently.\n\nArlo Devlin-Brown, a white-collar defense lawyer, told Business Insider he thought AI models could potentially improve attorney-client information. But given the ambiguity in the law, people have to be vigilant.\n\n\"Until the law has been clarified, lawyers should caution their clients that inputting otherwise privileged information into an AI tool could risk exposure in litigation,\" he said in an email.\n\nRepresentatives for the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and Anthropic, and lawyers for Heppner, didn't immediately reply to requests for comment.",

    "description": "Circuit Judge Mark Hayes has ruled in favor of Spartanburg County in a years-long dispute over the prominent display of a Confederate flag near I-85.",
    "fullText": "A Confederate flag that has been on prominent display along Interstate 85 in Spartanburg County has been ordered to fly no longer, according to a ruling by Judge Mark Hayes.\n\nOn Jan. 29, Hayes rejected the Adam Washington Ballenger Camp #68, Sons of Confederate Veterans' appeal of a decision by the Spartanburg Planning and Development Department, which said the 120-foot flagpole was in violation of county regulations.\n\nThe flag was located on Teaberry Road, near I-85.\n\nAccording to the county, because the lot was vacant and had no primary use, such as a residence or business, the “accessory” use of the flagpole was noncompliant with land-use rules.\n\nIn 2023, the Spartanburg County Board of Zoning Appeals ruled in favor of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, overturning the county's decision.\n\nThe matter then went to the circuit civil court, with the county seeking to overturn the zoning appeals board’s decision.\n\nThe Confederate flag has long been a politically contentious symbol in South Carolina. Critics point to its connection to white supremacist groups and the South's history of slavery. Flag defenders have described it as a symbol of regional pride and respect for their ancestors.\n\nWhile the flag's display along I-85 -- in a location where more than 80,000 passed by on an average day -- sparked controversy, the flag flew for many years in a place of even greater prominence: the South Carolina statehouse.\n\nThe Confederate flag was placed atop the statehouse in 1961 in a move to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Civil War.\n\nIt was also in the midst of the Civil Rights era, and Southern states were resisting the push for equality for Black citizens. The flag became a symbol of that resistance for many.\n\nMore: Debate over Confederate flag took on psychology of its own\n\nSouth Carolina kept the Confederate flag flying above the statehouse until 2000, when a compromise was reached to place a smaller version of the flag on the Confederate soldier monument in front of the Capitol building.\n\nThe compromise followed years of debate over the flag's meaning and its appropriateness as a state symbol.\n\nIn 1999, the national NAACP called for a boycott of South Carolina, putting economic pressure on the state.\n\nEventually, the state's business leaders signaled support for removing the flag from the statehouse dome.\n\nFormer Gov. Nikki Haley called for its removal from the statehouse grounds altogether in 2015 after white supremacist Dylann Roof murdered nine people inside the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.\n\nThe flag could once be seen driving south on I-85 and was located off Teaberry Road in Spartanburg County.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Greenville News: Spartanburg County Confederate flag along I-85 ordered to be removed",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian Vladyslav Heraskevych remain banned from 2026 Winter Olympics skeleton competition after his appeal was rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Friday.\n\nThe slider was banned by ruling body IBSF based on International Olympic Committee (IOC) rules over a dispute concerning a helmet he wanted to wear in the event to honour athletes killed in the war with Russia.\n\nThe court said in a statement following an emergency ruling that the sole arbitrator appointed for this matter \"whilst fully sympathetic to Mr Heraskevyc's commemoration, is bound by rules in the IOC Athlete Expression Guidelines.\"\n\nThe arbitrator considers that these guidelines \"provide a reasonable balance between athletes' interests to express their views, and athletes' interests to receive undivided attention for their sporting performance on the field of play.\"\n\nHeraskevych had argued that \"the exclusion is disproportionate, unsupported by any technical or safety violation and causes irreparable sporting harm to him.\"\n\nThe CAS arbitrator said that she was sympathetic with Heraskevych's attempt to \"raise awareness for the grief and devastation suffered by the Ukrainian people.\"\n\nBut she added that the limitations imposed by the IOC to express views during competitions on the field of play are \"reasonable and proportionate, considering the other opportunities for athletes to raise awareness (in mixed zones, in press conferences, on social networks, or in Mr Heraskevych’s case, wearing the helmet during four training runs).\"\n\nHeraskevych had already ruled out racing\n\nEarlier, Heraskevych appeared to have ruled out racing at the Olympics even if he won his appeal against the exclusion.\n\n\"It looks like this train has left,\" the 27-year-old, draped in the Ukrainan flag, told reporters after emerging from a two-and-a-half-hour hearing. \"I cannot do another race so it is done.\"\n\nHis CAS hearing began at a hotel in Milan on Friday and he said he was \"positive\" that his appeal would be upheld.\n\nThe court has set up an ad hoc division to deal with Olympic appeals quickly.\n\nThe first two runs of the Olympic skeleton competition in Cortina took place without Heraskevych, despite him finishing among the top six in all five training runs. The medal runs are scheduled for later on Friday.\n\nA reinstatement would be complicated and the athlete said racing in a symbolic one run was unlikely given the sport is dangerous.\n\n\"From a competitive perspective this makes no sense,\" he said, as he slammed the IOC's \"mockery\" for removing his Games accreditation and then giving it him back despite his racing ban.\n\nHeraskevych had refused repeated warnings from the IOC to give up wearing his helmet.\n\nThe IOC does not allow any kind of political statements in competition. He says this is different as it is a commemoration and not political, something he believes other athletes have been allowed to do.\n\nBut IOC president Kirsty Coventry told a news conference: \"The rules are the rules and I believe in the rules.\n\n\"We have to allow for athletes to express themselves but also to keep athletes safe.\"\n\nShe said political messaging is permitted away from actual competition, in press conferences for example, but that athletes themselves had agreed that the actual events should be neutral.\n\n\"I think he in some ways understood (the rules), but was very committed to his beliefs, but sadly it doesn't change the rules,\" Coventry said.\n\nHeraskevych was excluded shortly before the start of the first run in Cortina d'Ampezzo on Thursday.\n\nIn his appeal, he requested the annulment of the decision and \"that CAS reinstates him in the 2026 [Olympic Winter Games] with immediate effect, or in the alternative, that the athlete performs a CAS supervised official run pending the final decision.\"\n\nAround 40 members of the European Parliament have backed the slider and have written to the IOC, calling the ban wrong.\n\nPress reaction in Europe has also been largely against the IOC, while some Russian media in contrast have said the body has been too soft in giving his accreditation back.\n\nRussia as a nation is not allowed at the Games because of the war, but some individual Russian athletes are competing as neutrals after proving they have not actively supported the conflict.",

Rosen said “newly discovered evidence” in the criminal case against Alfredo Alejandro Aljorna and Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis “is materially inconsistent with the allegations against them” made in a criminal complaint and at a court hearing last month.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Paul A. Magnuson dismissed the case with prejudice, meaning the charges against the two men cannot be resubmitted.\n\nThe dismissal follows a string of high-profile shootings involving federal immigration agents where eyewitness statements and video evidence have called into question claims made to justify using deadly force. Dozens of felony cases against protesters accused of assaulting or impeding federal officers have also crumbled.\n\nA lawyer for Aljorna and Sosa-Celis said Friday that they and their families are “overjoyed” that all the charges have been dismissed. Had they been convicted, the two immigrants would have faced years in federal prison.\n\n“The charges against them were based on lies by an ICE agent who recklessly shot into their home through a closed door,” said Brian D. Clark, a lawyer for the two men. “They are so happy justice is being served by the government’s request to dismiss all charges with prejudice.”\n\nAn FBI investigator said in an affidavit that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers attempted to conduct a traffic stop on a vehicle driven by Aljorna on Jan. 14. He crashed the vehicle and fled on foot toward an apartment complex. An immigration officer chased Aljorna who — according to the government — violently resisted arrest.\n\nAs the officer and Aljorna struggled on the ground, Sosa-Celis and another man came out of a nearby apartment and attacked the officer with a snow shovel and a broom handle, according to the complaint. The officer, who was not named in court filings, fired his handgun, striking Sosa-Celis in the upper right thigh. The men fled into a nearby apartment, and were arrested.\n\nA request for comment from the U.S. Attorney for Minnesota received an automated response Friday saying the office no longer has a public information officer. There has been a wave of staff departures from the federal prosecutor's office since the Trump administration launched Operation Metro Surge, a concentrated immigration enforcement effort targeting the Twin Cities. The Justice Department in Washington has not responded to a request for comment.\n\nThe day after the shooting, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem attacked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, accusing the Democrats of “encouraging impeding and assault against our law enforcement which is a federal crime, a felony.”\n\n“What we saw last night in Minneapolis was an attempted murder of federal law enforcement,\" Noem said in a Jan. 15 statement. “Our officer was ambushed and attacked by three individuals who beat him with snow shovels and the handles of brooms. Fearing for his life, the officer fired a defensive shot.”\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has not responded to requests for comment Friday asking whether Noem stands by those statements. The department also did not respond to questions about whether there was any investigation into the shooting or whether the ICE officer would face disciplinary action.\n\nClark, the lawyer for Aljorna and Sosa-Celis, called Friday for the identify of the ICE agent to be made public and that he \"be charged for his crime.”\n\nRosen's motion seeking to drop the charges did not detail what new evidence had emerged or what falsehoods had been in the government's prior filings, but cracks began to appear in the government's case during a Jan. 21 court hearing to determine whether the accused men could be released pending trial.\n\nIn court, the ICE officer's account of the moments before the shooting differed significantly from testimony from the two defendants and three eyewitnesses. The ICE officer’s account that he was assaulted with a broom and snow shovel was also not corroborated by available video evidence.\n\nAljorna and Sosa-Celis denied assaulting the agent with a broom or a snow shovel. Neither video evidence nor testimony from a neighbor and the men’s romantic partners supported the agent’s account that he had been attacked with a broom or shovel or that a third person was involved.\n\nFrederick Goetz, a lawyer representing Aljorna, said his client had a broomstick in his hand and threw it at the agent as he ran toward the house. Attorney Robin Wolpert, representing Sosa-Celis, said he had been holding a shovel but was retreating into the home when the officer fired, wounding him. The men’s attorneys said the prosecution’s case relied wholly on testimony from the agent who fired the gun.\n\nNeither Aljorna and Sosa-Celis had violent criminal records. Both had been working as DoorDash delivery drivers at night in an attempt to avoid encounters with federal agents, their attorneys said.\n\nAljorna and Sosa-Celis retreated into a nearby home and they barricaded the door to prevent federal agents from entering, according to the FBI agent. Federal officers used tear gas to try to force the men out of their home, he added. Out of concern for the safety of two children inside the home — both under the age of 2 — Aljorna and Sosa-Celis turned themselves over to authorities.\n\nBiesecker reported from Washington.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NCAA’s absence spoke almost as loudly as the judge’s ruling.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon in a Mississippi courtroom, Trinidad Chambliss was granted a preliminary injunction that effectively awards him an extra year of eligibility, clearing the way for the Ole Miss quarterback to play in 2026.\n\nBut as Judge Robert Whitwell prepared to deliver his decision, one detail stood out. The NCAA’s counsel had already left the courtroom and was not present for the final ruling. The hearing in Pittsboro, Miss. marked the culmination of a fight between Chambliss, Ole Miss officials and the NCAA over whether a medically sidelined 2022 season at Ferris State Bulldogs should count against his eligibility clock.\n\nIn 20+ years of law practice, I've never seen opposing counsel leave the court before the decision was rendered.

The NCAA denied his waiver request three separate times, including an initial application, an appeal and a reconsideration request submitted with additional medical documentation.\n\nThe association maintained that he was not denied the opportunity to compete and therefore did not qualify for a medical hardship waiver.\n\nOle Miss officials sharply disagreed, arguing that the documented medical circumstances warranted approval at the staff level. After exhausting internal NCAA channels, Chambliss filed suit in Chancery Court, seeking both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.\n\nMore: Demond Williams bombshell could've resulted in Lane Kiffin being fired at LSU\n\nThe financial stakes are substantial. Chambliss’ return to Oxford is tied to a compensation package reportedly exceeding $5 million in name, image and likeness earnings.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from transferring 20 inmates with commuted death sentences to the nation’s highest security federal prison, warning that officials cannot employ a “sham” process for deciding where to incarcerate the prisoners for the rest of their lives.\n\nU.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly ruled late Wednesday that the government cannot send the former death row inmates to the “Supermax” federal prison in Florence, Colorado, because it likely would violate their Fifth Amendment rights to due process.\n\nKelly cited evidence that officials from the Republican administration “made it clear” to the federal Bureau of Prisons that the inmates had to be sent to ADX Florence — “administrative maximum\" — to punish them because Democratic President Joe Biden had commuted their death sentences.\n\n“At least for now, they will remain serving life sentences for their heinous crimes where they are currently imprisoned,” wrote Kelly, who was nominated to the bench by President Donald Trump.\n\nIn December 2024, less than a month before Trump returned to the White House, Biden commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row, converting their punishments to life imprisonment.\n\nOn his first day back in office, Trump issued an executive order directing Attorney General Pam Bondi to house the 37 inmates “in conditions consistent with the monstrosity of their crimes and the threats they pose.”\n\nTwenty of the 37 inmates are plaintiffs in the lawsuit before Kelly, who issued a preliminary injunction blocking their transfers to Florence while the lawsuit proceeds. All were incarcerated in Terre Haute, Indiana, when Biden commuted their death sentences.\n\nGovernment lawyers argued that the bureau has broad authority to decide what facilities the inmates should be redesignated for after their commutations.\n\n“BOP’s designation decisions are within its exclusive purview and are intended to preserve the safety of inmates, employees, and surrounding communities,” they wrote.\n\nThe judge concluded that the inmates have not had a meaningful opportunity to challenge their redesignations because it appears the outcome of the review process was predetermined.\n\n\"But the Constitution requires that whenever the government seeks to deprive a person of a liberty or property interest that the Due Process Clause protects — whether that person is a notorious prisoner or a law-abiding citizen — the process it provides cannot be a sham,\" Kelly wrote.\n\nThe Florence prison has housed some of the most notorious criminals in federal custody, including Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Mexican drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. The prison is “unmatched in its draconian conditions,” the inmates' attorneys argued.\n\n“The categorical redesignations challenged here deprived Plaintiffs of an opportunity to show why they should not be condemned to a life bereft of human contact, in a cell the size of a parking spot, where they will see nothing out the window but a strip of sky,” they wrote.\n\nGovernment attorneys said other courts have held that the conditions are not objectively cruel and unusual.\n\n“Plaintiffs fail to show that conditions at ADX are atypical for them,” they wrote.",

    "title": "Zillow just dealt a big blow to Compass — but it may be too little too late",
    "description": "The home-search giant can continue banning some real estate listings from its site, a judge ruled. Homebuyers still face a messy search process.",
    "fullText": "Search for a home on Compass.com, the website of America's largest real estate brokerage, and you'll find a familiar layout: a map of available homes, a bunch of price tags, a lineup of shimmering kitchens and golden-hour facades. It all looks a lot like Zillow, the near-ubiquitous home search site.\n\nThere is one key difference between Compass' site and Zillow, though: a prominently displayed black box.\n\nBehind the black box sits a heap of listings beyond Zillow's reach, so-called \"Private Exclusives\" that can only be seen with the help of a Compass agent. The intrigue is undeniable: \"Unlock 347 (8%) more homes you won't find anywhere else,\" the box urges when I search in the Austin area. In Los Angeles, there are apparently 366 homes that can only be unearthed by contacting Compass. New York City boasts nearly 450 homes you can't find on Zillow, Realtor.com, or any other home-search portal.\n\nEach of these homes is technically in violation of Zillow's hotly debated \"Listing Access Standards,\" rules the search giant unveiled last April to crack down on agents — many of them at Compass — sharing homes in some places but not others. The country's most popular home-search portal has gone so far as to ban some listings from its vaunted website, which Zillow says is necessary to stem the rising tide of exclusive listings and preserve a fair and open marketplace: \"If a listing is online, it should be online everywhere,\" begins one of the company's blog posts.\n\nThe ban prompted a swift legal response from Compass, which sued Zillow in federal court, claiming the search site was using its monopoly power to quash competition. Compass may not want its listings on Zillow right away, but it does want them there eventually: CEO Robert Reffkin has likened the \"private exclusive\" phase to a movie trailer that drums up hype before a wider release. If Zillow bans listings, that wide release loses its luster.\n\nOn Friday, Zillow scored an early victory in the legal battle: A judge denied Compass's request for a preliminary injunction, which would have forced Zillow to stop enforcing its new rules. Compass' lawyers failed to show that Zillow is actually a monopoly, the judge concluded, so the so-called \"Zillow Ban\" lives — for now.\n\nThe judge's ruling is a big step in the real estate listing war, but the future of home search still looks murky.\n\nFor one thing, it's not even clear that Zillow really wants to enforce its own rules. Under the company's Listing Access Standards, agents who market a home publicly — posting a sign in the front yard, advertising the listing on their brokerage's website, or merely teasing its existence via Compass' black box — have one business day to share the home with everyone or risk having it blacklisted from Zillow. During the injunction hearing, though, the company revealed that it had sent about 1,200 warnings and banned just 50 homes from its site over a roughly four-month period last year. Internal documents also showed executives fretting over the risks of turning away agents and their listings. It's not a great look for the biggest name in home search to openly admit that it can't — or won't — show you every home for sale. Zillow may keep up its tepid enforcement of the ban, and it may very well deter some agents, especially those reliant on Zillow's reach, from following Compass' lead. But it won't stop these \"exclusive listings\" from proliferating.\n\n\"Zillow's not going to go out and ban thousands of listings,\" says Mike DelPrete, a tech strategist and scholar-in-residence at the University of Colorado Boulder. \"They'd be shooting themselves in the foot.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Compass just keeps getting more powerful. Since the courtroom proceedings in November, the company has sidestepped regulatory scrutiny (thanks to some savvy politicking) to close on its acquisition of the second-largest brokerage in the US, Anywhere Real Estate, which owns household names like Corcoran, Century 21, and Coldwell Banker, among others. The combined company, including franchisees, would account for almost a quarter of nationwide home sales volume based on last year's figures, according to an analysis by T3 Sixty, a real estate management consulting firm. More agents mean more listings, which makes Compass' stockpile of exclusive homes all the more valuable. If Compass continues to advertise listings only on its own platforms — in internal databases or simply on the public-facing side of its website — it could attract even more agents and clients by promising them an edge in home search. \"Come here,\" the pitch goes, \"and you'll get access to a VIP room filled with the area's hottest listings.\" As one longtime real estate executive told me last year, \"Listings are fuel.\"\n\nThe legal setback doesn't amount to a total loss for Compass. Its antitrust case against Zillow will continue to wind its way through the courts, and the company could still prevail in a jury trial. Or Compass could simply decide to pursue its vision regardless of the courtroom result. \"We'll never give up,\" Reffkin, Compass' CEO, told me at company headquarters late last year, when I pressed him on the possibility that the legal battle doesn't go his way. Even if Zillow blocks some listings from its platform, Compass may plow ahead under the assumption that buyers and their agents will gravitate toward any place that offers them a leg up in their home search. And while Zillow may come out on top in the courtroom, the underlying state of play probably won't change. Compass still maintains thousands of home listings that are unavailable on other search portals. Other big brokerages are following suit, building up their own stockpiles of exclusive inventory in preparation for a world in which listings are more closely guarded rather than shared broadly from the get-go.\n\nIf you're looking to buy a house, this reality could make choosing an agent all the more fraught. Not only will you have to gauge their grasp on the local market or their negotiating chops, but you'll also have to consider how many listings you could gain early access to by choosing their brokerage. Some agents have always been able to unlock more inventory than others, via \"private listing networks\" or chummy relationships with potential sellers in the area. But if brokerages encourage more of their agents to share homes internally before making their broader debut, bigger companies like Compass could gain a decisive advantage, particularly in markets where they control a significant share of listings. This shift could make it more difficult to shrug off an agent and go it alone, or weaken your negotiating position if you want to bargain down your agent's fees. It also raises the real possibility of house-hunting FOMO: Even if the vast majority of these listings are eventually shared everywhere, you may have already missed the chance to be first in line for your dream home.\n\nFor now, these are still mostly hypothetical — the judge's ruling on a Friday morning didn't alter the status quo. It did, however, offer a preview of the messiness to come: more legal barbs, more blog posts, and, most importantly, more listings squirreled away in private databases or posted beyond Zillow's reach. Homebuyers, take note: The old way of searching for homes is fading fast.\n\nJames Rodriguez is a correspondent on Business Insider's Discourse team.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — A federal judge on Monday blocked a California law from going into effect that would ban federal immigration agents from covering their faces, but they will still be required to wear clear identification showing their agency and badge number.\n\nCalifornia became the first state to ban most law enforcement officers from wearing facial coverings under a bill that was signed in September following the summer of high-profile raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Trump administration filed a lawsuit in November challenging the laws, arguing that they would threaten the safety of officers who are facing harassment, doxing, and violence and that they violated the constitution because the state is directly regulating the federal government.\n\nJudge Christina Snyder said she issued the initial ruling because the mask ban as it was enacted did not also apply to state law enforcement authorities, discriminating against the federal government. The ruling could have national implications as states grapple with how to deal with federal agents enforcing the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.\n\nIt left open the possibility to future legislation banning federal agents from wearing masks if it applied to all law enforcement agencies, with Snyder writing \"the Court finds that federal officers can perform their federal functions without wearing masks.” The ruling will go into effect Feb. 19.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the bill in September banning some law enforcement officers from wearing masks, neck gaiters, and other facial coverings. It was slated to go into effect Jan. 1 but was put on hold due to the lawsuit.\n\nIn addition to exempting state law enforcement officers, it made exceptions for undercover agents, protective equipment like N95 respirators or tactical gear, and other situations where not wearing a mask would jeopardize an operation. Snyder sided with the federal government, which argued this exemption was discriminatory against federal agents.\n\nNewsom also signed into law a measure requiring law enforcement to wear clear identification showing their agency and badge number while on the job, which was challenged by the federal government but upheld by the judge.\n\nCalifornia State Sen. Scott Weiner, who proposed the original bill to ban facial coverings, said Monday he would immediately introduce new legislation to include state police in the law.\n\n“ICE and Border Patrol are covering their faces to maximize their terror campaign and to insulate themselves from accountability,” Weiner said in a news release. “We will ensure our mask ban can be enforced.”\n\nAt a Jan. 14 hearing, Snyder repeatedly asked the government’s lawyer, Tiberius Davis, to explain why banning masks would impede the federal law enforcement in carrying out their duties, if officers rarely wore masks prior to 2025.\n\nDavis cited claims by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that there has been a multifold increase in assaults and threats against federal officers. He also brought up an incident in Los Angeles where three women are being accused of livestreaming while following an ICE agent home and posting the address on Instagram.\n\n“There is real deterrence on the officer’s safety and ability to perform their duties,” Davis said.\n\nCameron Bell, California Department of Justice attorney, challenged his claims, saying there was no concrete evidence that federal agents can’t perform their duties without facial coverings.\n\nBell referenced declarations from U.S citizens who have been detained by federal agents but thought they were being kidnapped.\n\n“It’s obvious why these laws are in the public interest,” Bell said.\n\nThe federal government also argued in legal briefs that allowing California’s legislation could lead other states to be “emboldened to impose similar unconstitutional restraints.”\n\nDavis cited a statement from Newsom in July 2025 during an interview posted online where he discussed the mask ban bill, saying, “It appears that we don’t have the legal authority for federal agents but we do for other law enforcement authorities.”\n\nLos Angeles County supervisors voted in December to enact a local ordinance banning law enforcement from wearing masks that went into effect Jan. 8. However, the sheriff’s department said it would not enforce the ordinance until after the court ruled on the statewide mask ban. The Los Angeles Police Department had also said it wouldn’t enforce the mask ban.",

    "fullText": "(Reuters) Feb 8 - On the edge of Venezuela’s main oil city Maracaibo, members of a local branch of the ruling socialist party went door-to-door in the weeks after U.S. forces captured President Nicolas Maduro, asking residents if they still supported the party that has run the country for nearly 20 years. The result: about half of members said they no longer did.\n\n“The response is very bad,” said a person who helped lead the effort. “There is division among us.”\n\nWhile Reuters was not able to independently verify the canvassing results, the reported drop in support aligned with ​information gathered from three other parts of the country.\n\nThe news agency spoke to 13 party members or local leaders across four states who reported fractures in the United Socialist Party (PSUV) following the U.S. attack. All of them expressed a deep sense of uncertainty and many voiced worries about their economic future.\n\nThe government’s ‌patronage system, which bought a form of party loyalty through financial benefits and food parcels, also appears to be under pressure, with five of the sources saying some contributions had stopped since Maduro’s capture.\n\nSix of the people described distrust among party loyalists and spreading suspicion of interim President Delcy Rodriguez. Eight said they had seen a drop in participation and support at their local party branch, with two of them estimating a ‌70% fall in attendance at events like marches and local assembly meetings.\n\nThe people Reuters spoke to all requested anonymity for fear of reprisal, with several saying local leaders were encouraging the party faithful to snitch on any members losing faith in the cause, a common tactic for weeding out popular dissent in Venezuela. Reuters has withheld the names of the people it interviewed to protect their safety.\n\nThere are no recent public numbers on party membership and while Reuters talked to people observing falling participation in four geographically dispersed states, the news agency could not determine what the situation was across all 24 states in the country. Most foreign media do not have permanent staff in the country and Venezuelans are generally reluctant to speak freely with reporters because of potential reprisals.\n\nNeither the Venezuelan government nor PSUV responded to Reuters requests for comment on the eroding support for the party and the fraying of its patronage system.\n\nCalls for national unity in the face of threats to Venezuela have been a constant in Rodriguez’s speeches and public appearances since Maduro's removal, and she has also cheered the resilience of the ⁠country's people and pledged economic development for all.\n\nDespite decrying Maduro’s detention as a kidnapping, Rodriguez appears to be complying with ‌U.S. demands to open the country to American oil companies and has also met with the director of the Central Intelligence Agency to discuss cooperation against drug trafficking.\n\nFraying party support at the grassroots level would be a problem for Rodriguez. Reuters has previously reported how she is already battling to shore up her rule by putting allies in positions of power to shield herself from the potential threat posed by Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, who also heads the PSUV and has close connections to the security services and colectivos - the hardline motorcycle-riding ‍enforcement arm of the party.\n\nPublicly, Cabello has stressed unity. On Jan. 12, he used his weekly press conference as party leader to emphasize Rodriguez has \"all the support of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela.”\n\nNeither U.S. President Donald Trump nor Rodriguez has seriously addressed the question of elections since Maduro’s ouster, but the anecdotal dwindling of local support appears to point to an uncomfortable truth for the PSUV: Maduro’s exit has done little to improve popularity, according to the party members Reuters interviewed.\n\nA local party leader in the northern state of Aragua said the party had no way to grow or ​win elections, “even if we had Che Guevara or Gandhi as a candidate.\"\n\n“You have a situation where the apparatus of repression is fragmenting and on top of that the remaining grassroots base is demobilizing. That’s a huge challenge for governability,” said Ricardo Rios, head of Caracas-based analysis and consultancy firm Poder & Estrategia.\n\nStill, local support for the party ‌may revive. Venezuela has already received $500 million from crude sales and any significant economic improvement could help boost funding of the party and get membership perks, which have historically helped buttress support, flowing again.\n\nIn response to Reuters questions about the problems facing the Socialist Party, a senior White House official said: “The country is stable, illegal migration has stopped, drug flows have halted, and the new oil deal will generate economic prosperity for both the Venezuelan and American people.\"\n\nAll of Venezuela's top officials are long-time members of the PSUV. The party was created in 2007 by merging the disparate political and social forces that swept socialist President Hugo Chavez to power in 1999. That movement also came to bear his name - ‘Chavismo.’\n\nThe reasons given for falling local support varied. Some said people were wary of being associated with the party if the opposition were to win power, fearing some form of retribution. Others said uncertainty was causing infighting in ⁠the party. Nearly all spoke of disillusionment and questioned the loyalty of the new leadership to the Chavista cause.\n\nAdding to people’s hardship are problems with the delivery of party handouts, both food and ​financial, that have hit local branches, five sources said. They said members in three states - Zulia, Aragua and Falcon – were deserting the party because the government had stopped making bonus payments and distributing welfare. Reuters ​was not able to independently verify the information it gathered about stalling handouts.\n\nGovernment payments, which through various different benefits can for some add up to over $100 a month, are a vital income for millions in Venezuela, where the monthly minimum wage is less than $1 and poverty is rampant. Inflation is also estimated by analysts to have topped 400% in 2025.\n\nThe complexity of Venezuela's welfare system, with an array of benefits delivered at different times to different people, meant Reuters was unable to get a complete picture of the status of all payments and food ‍parcels, with some of those interviewed saying certain bonuses were still arriving while others were ⁠not.\n\nOne source in Zulia state said that in their district 600 people had not received their “family bonus”, a direct welfare payment of up to $65 given to help with living costs. Three sources also reported that food parcels, known as CLAP, have not been delivered, with some adding that problems with these deliveries predate the capture of Maduro but have continued since.\n\nIn the municipality of Mara, in the northwest border with Colombia, one party member said there were old-school Socialist Party members still committed to the cause and “clapping like seals” but that even they are “turning because they haven't been paid their bonuses.\"\n\nAbout 70% of local party members and ⁠public employees in Mara ignored calls to participate in two recent pro-Maduro marches, the person said, leading bosses to threaten people with firings. Reuters could not establish the size of the marches or if there were any firings as a result.\n\nFour of the people Reuters spoke to reported that even the motorbike-riding ‘colectivos’ were attending fewer events and have not been mobilized to push people into public support of the government. Their ‌members have been responsible for killing opposition figures and anti-government protesters, according to reports, which Reuters has not independently confirmed, from organizations like Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe person in Mara said many colectivo members are now working as motorbike taxi drivers, failing to show up to marches despite threats from ‌local authorities to revoke their mototaxi work permits, the person said. \"They hide, they fake an illness and a few have gone to Colombia.\"",

    "description": "Attorneys for the federal government have until next Thursday to reach an agreement with human rights lawyers who are seeking to ensure the right to counsel for people detained at an Immigration and C...",
    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Attorneys for the federal government have until next Thursday to reach an agreement with human rights lawyers who are seeking to ensure the right to counsel for people detained at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Minnesota, a judge said Friday.\n\nAdvocates said people held at the facility on the edge of Minneapolis who face possible deportation are denied adequate access to lawyers, including in-person meetings. Attorney Jeffrey Dubner said detainees are allowed to make phone calls, but ICE personnel are typically nearby.\n\nU.S. District Judge Nancy Brasel told Justice Department attorney Christina Parascandola that there seemed to be a “very wide factual disconnect” between what the human rights lawyers allege and the government’s claims of adequate access at what ICE depicts as only a temporary holding facility.\n\nParascandola said people detained at the facility have access to counsel and unmonitored phone calls at any time and for as long as they need. She conceded she had never been there.\n\nBrasel called her argument “a tough sell,” noting there was far more evidence in the case record to back up the plaintiffs’ claims than the government’s assurances.\n\n“The gap here is so enormous I don’t know how you're going to close it,\" the judge said.\n\nRather than ruling on the spot, Brasel told both sides to keep meeting with a retired judge who's mediating and who has helped narrow some of the gaps already. She noted at the start of the hearing that both sides agreed that “some degree of reasonable access” to legal counsel is constitutionally necessary but that they differed on the details of what that should look like.\n\nIf the sides don't reach at least a partial agreement by 5 p.m. Thursday, Feb. 12, the judge said she'll issue her order then. She didn't specify which way she'd rule.\n\nA member of Congress decries conditions at detention center\n\nThe facility is part of the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, which is a center of ICE operations and has been the scene of frequent protests.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Kelly Morrison, of Minnesota, said in a statement Friday that conditions at the detention center continue to be poor. The physician said she learned in her visit Thursday night that the facility has no protocols in place to prevent the spread of measles to Minnesota from Texas. At least two cases were reported at a major ICE detention center in Texas this week.\n\nSome Minnesota detainees including families with children have been sent to the Texas facility, and some have returned to Minnesota after courts intervened, including 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father.\n\n“It’s abundantly clear that Whipple is not at all equipped to handle what the Trump Administration is doing with their cruel and chaotic ‘Operation Metro Surge,’” Morrison said in a statement. “I am stunned by the inability or unwillingness of the federal agents to answer some of the most basic questions about their operations and protocols.”\n\nEven though a federal judge ruled Monday that members of Congress have the right to make unannounced visits to ICE facilities, Morrison said in a statement that agents attempted to deny her entry for nearly a half-hour and demanded that she leave before eventually letting her in.\n\nOn her first attempt last month, Morrison and fellow Minnesota Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar and Angie Craig were turned away.\n\nAfter she was able to enter the facility last weekend, Morrison said no real medical care was being offered to people held there.\n\nCraig and Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum said they were turned away despite the court order when they tried to visit the facility overnight.\n\n“We have heard countless reports that detainees are being held in unlivable conditions at Whipple,” the two representatives said in a statement. “We have every reason to believe that this administration is once again lying through their teeth and trying to hide what we all know to be true -- that they are ignoring due process and treating immigrants as political pawns, not people.”\n\nMan charged with fel ony for wrecking anti-ICE sculpture\n\nA supporter of the immigration crackdown who posted a video on social media of himself kicking down an anti-ICE sculpture outside the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul was released from jail Friday after being charged with a felony count of damage to property.\n\nLt. Mike Lee, a spokesperson for the Minnesota State Patrol, said Capitol Security observed Jake Lang, 30, of Lake Worth, Florida, damaging the display Thursday afternoon. He was arrested a short distance away. The ice sculpture spelled out “Prosecute ICE.”\n\nAt his first court appearance, Lang was released pending trial but ordered to stay at least three blocks away from the Capitol. Court records don't list an attorney who could comment on his behalf.\n\nLang was drowned out by a large crowd last month when he attempted to hold a small rally in Minneapolis in support of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Lang was previously charged with assaulting an officer and other crimes before receiving clemency as part of President Donald Trump’s sweeping intervention on behalf of Jan. 6 defendants last year.",

    "fullText": "A widely covered Minnesota court hearing in which a federal prosecutor told a judge \"this job sucks\" saw the same judge reveal that \"hundreds\" of the people brought before him for immigration proceedings during Operation Metro Surge have the legal right to live in the United States.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Jerry W. Blackwell said the \"overwhelming majority\" of people brought to his court by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs & Border Protection (CBP) since the Trump administration's crackdown started have been \"lawfully present\" in the country.\n\nIt backs up the growing number of witness accounts and victim testimonies that the federal operation has expanded way beyond the supposed scope of targeting undocumented immigrants with violent criminal histories, with refugees, legal permanent residents, and even U.S. citizens being swept up in the crackdown.\n\n\"The overwhelming majority of the hundreds seen by this court have been found to be lawfully present,\" Blackwell said during the Feb. 3 hearing in St. Paul. \"They live in their communities. Some are separated from their families.\"\n\nThe reason for the hearing on Tuesday was \"compliance with court orders,\" with Blackwell seeeking answers from the federal government on why lawful citizens are being held in custody when they \"should have been left alone\" and \"not arrested in the first place.\"\n\nBlackwell said the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and ICE \"are not above the law,\" adding: \"They wield extraordinary power, and that power has to exist within constitutional limits.\"\n\nThe issue at hand during the hearing was the detention of \"large numbers of people, including individuals who are lawfully present in the United States,\" and the DOJ, in some cases, failing to meet its obligation of releasing them from custody upon order, and thus violating their constitutional rights.\n\nDuring the hearing, federal prosecutor Julie T. Le bemoaned the way immigration cases are being handled , saying: \"What do you want me to do? The system sucks. This job sucks. And I am trying [with] every breath that I have so that I can get you what you need,\" saying it's like \"pulling teeth\" to get federal agencies into compliance.\n\n\"I am here just trying to make sure that the agency understands how important it is to comply with all the court orders, which they have not done in the past or currently,\" she said.\n\nBut Blackwell responded: \"Having what you feel are too many detainees, too many cases, too many deadlines, and not enough infrastructure to keep up with it all, is not a defense to continued detention. If anything, it ought to be a warning sign.\"\n\nBlackwell said he's found himself having to send upwards of a half a dozen emails asking for the date, time, and location of someone who was ordered to be released, only to be ignored as the individuals remained in custody against their rights.\n\nBlackwell was addressing Ana H. Voss, an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Minnesota, and Le, who said she was working as an ICE attorney for DHS in immigration court before she \"stupidly\" volunteered to work the detail in Minnesota.\n\n\"I have to be honest, we have no guidance or direction on what we need to do,\" Le told Blackwell. \"And so when you showed up, they just throw you in the well, and then here we go.\"\n\nLe said she was receiving orders to have detainees released via her DOJ email, which she claimed she was having trouble accessing.\n\n\"So are you telling the court that you were brought in brand new, a shiny, brand new penny into this role, and you received no proper orientation or training on what you were supposed to do?\" Blackwell said.\n\n\"I have to say yes to that question, Your Honor,\" Le replied.\n\nBlackwell presented an example where a man was arrested by ICE on Jan. 10, a man Blackwell said had no criminal history \"that warranted mandatory custody,\" and as such he ordered his release on Jan. 15.\n\nWhile the order mandated his release within 48 hours, Le claimed she didn't see it until Jan. 17. The judge again ordered the man's release on Jan. 19, by which point he had been sent to a detention center in Texas.\n\nThe man was then scheduled to be flown from El Paso, Texas, to Minneapolis on Jan. 20 for release, but he wound up being transferred to a detention center in New Mexico, and he wasn't due back in Minnesota for his release until Jan. 24.\n\n\"And this is already nine days after this person has been ordered released and found to have been unlawfully detained in the first place,\" Blackwell said.\n\nIn the end, the man wasn't released until Jan. 28 – a full 13 days after Blackwell ordered he be set free.\n\nBlackwell said he had to ask multiple times for an explanation from Le about why the man's flight from New Mexico to Minnesota was delayed for alleged \"safety concerns,\" but Le allegedly never responded.\n\nAccording to the transcript, Le said she \"was told if we provided all information, the protesters will show up at the airport, and the agent and other people will be in danger.\" Le did not say who instructed her not to respond.\n\n\"So I took it to heart,\" Le explained, \"because during that time, it was very heated here in Minnesota with all the protests that was going on. Any public thing that was going on is at risk. Even myself is also at risk for putting my name and myself in here, Your Honor. That's the safety concern that I have.\"\n\nNotably, Jan. 24, the day the man was due to return to Minnesota and be released, is the day that CBP agents fatally shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti in south Minneapolis.\n\nThe judge replied to Le: \"What we really want is simply compliance, because on the other side of this is somebody who should not have been arrested in some instances in the first place, who is being held in jail or put in shackles for days, if not a week-plus, after they've been ordered released.\"\n\nBlackwell noted that he's learned of situations where someone ordered for release \"is put out on the street with just the clothes on their backs and have to figure out how to get back here when they should not have been arrested here in the first place, let alone flown halfway across the continent of North America.\"\n\nDHS officials tout more than 4,000 arrests under Operation Metro Surge, but the department has not provided solid data to confirm the assertion, nor addressed whether the lawfully present residents cited repeatedly by Blackwell are reflected in that tally.",

He wasn’t selected in the 2023 draft, but he played for the Motor City Cruise in the NBA’s G League as recently as mid-January.\n\nHis lawyers argued that Bediako remains within his five-year college eligibility window. The NCAA denied Alabama’s initial petition, and NCAA President Charlie Baker and SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey have made it clear they are opposed to Bediako’s reinstatement.\n\nCrimson Tide coach Nate Oats said Friday that, regardless of the outcome of the case, Bediako will be allowed to remain on scholarship and work toward a college degree.",

    "description": "Luigi Mangione left court shouting \"double jeopardy\" after a Manhattan judge set a trial date that edges ahead of his federal trial date.",
    "fullText": "A state court judge in New York set a July 8 trial date in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on Friday, ending a nearly yearlong battle over who — federal or state prosecutors — will be first to try the accused killer, Luigi Mangione.\n\nThe short, contentious hearing ended with Mangione shouting to a courtroom audience of press and admirers about \"double jeopardy\" as he was led back to jail.\n\n\"It's the same trial twice,\" he said as he was escorted out of the courtroom in a jail uniform and handcuffs. \"One plus one equals two. Double jeopardy by any common sense definition.\"\n\nThe decision was a loss for his defense lawyers, who had urged that Mangione's state murder trial be held some time after his federal fatal stalking trial. That federal trial will now go second, with jury selection set for September 8 and opening statements for October 13.\n\n\"The defense will not be ready on July 8,\" defense lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo told the judge, during the hearing's most heated moment.\n\n\"Be ready!\" New York Supreme Court Justice Gregory Carro answered angrily.\n\nFriedman Agnifilo told the judge that her team, which includes her husband, Marc Agnifilo, has been extremely busy winning victories for their client. In September, she said, the team convinced Carro to drop the top charge in the state indictment, murder as an act of terrorism. Last week, she said, Mangione's federal judge tossed that indictment's top two counts, removing the risk of the death penalty.\n\nBut as she started to tell Carro, \"we haven't been twiddling our thumbs,\" the judge cut her off.\n\n\"Great,\" he interrupted, his voice impatient. \"You've done a great job. So be ready on July 8.\"\n\nWho gets to try Mangione first — New York or the feds — was a thorny question that was fought over for nearly a year in neighboring courthouses in lower Manhattan. And it's a battle that's all about double jeopardy.\n\nMangione's defense lawyers accuse lead state prosecutor Joel Seidemann of pushing to go first, before the feds, because going second would violate New York case law against double jeopardy — the state's restriction on trying someone twice for the same crime.\n\nSeidemann \"does not want his case to be double-jeopardied out because he did all that work,\" Friedman Agnifilo told the judge in court.\n\nSeidemann snapped back that the defense is seeking to deprive the state of New York from prosecuting \"a murder that happened in Midtown Manhattan, on our streets, to a guest in our city.\"\n\n\"All I can say is double jeopardy is something that was meant to protect people and they're using it as a weapon,\" Agnifilo Friedman said as she left the courthouse.\n\n\"This is a tug of war between two prosecutorial offices,\" she added — suggesting that the war, lost moments earlier by Mangione, may not be over.\n\nMangione, who is charged in both indictments with fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The father of two from Minnesota was ambushed from behind as he entered a Midtown Manhattan hotel to deliver remarks at an annual investor conference.\n\nMangione has been held without bail since his arrest on December 9, 2024 following a five-day manhunt.\n\nHe remains at the federal Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where last week a man was arrested on charges that he had impersonated an FBI agent in a botched effort to free an inmate — Mangione, according to a law enforcement source",

    "fullText": "Preliminary EU ruling says app shifts brains of users into ‘autopilot mode’, with concerns for children and vulnerable adults\n\nTikTok could be forced into changes to make the app less addictive to users after the EU indicated the platform had breached the bloc’s digital safety rules.\n\nThe EU’s executive arm said in a preliminary ruling that the popular app had infringed the Digital Services Act (DSA) due to its “addictive design”.\n\nThe European Commission said TikTok, which has more than 1 billion users worldwide, had not adequately assessed how its design could harm the physical and mental wellbeing of users including children and vulnerable adults.\n\nThe preliminary ruling accused TikTok of ignoring indicators of compulsive use, such as the amount of time children spend on the app at night.\n\nThe commission said it was considering forcing changes to the app’s design, including alterations to its powerful algorithm that pushes content to users.\n\n“At this stage, the commission considers that TikTok needs to change the basic design of its service,” it said in a statement. “For instance, by disabling key addictive features such as ‘infinite scroll’ over time, implementing effective ‘screen time breaks’, including during the night, and adapting its recommender system.”\n\nThe commission said TikTok’s safety regime appeared to be inadequate, singling out the screentime management and parental control tools as not doing enough to mitigate the risks created by the app’s addictive design. The screentime management features were too easy to dismiss and parental controls were time-draining to install, the preliminary ruling added.\n\nThe commission said its preliminary views did not prejudge the outcome of the investigation and TikTok would have the opportunity to challenge its findings.\n\nOnline safety campaigners have urged politicians to tackle features on social media platforms that encourage users to stay online. The crossbench peer and online safety campaigner Beeban Kidron, a leading voice in the UK debate, has urged the British government to “detoxify the dopamine loops” of addictive social media platforms.\n\nBreaches of the DSA can result in a fine totalling up to 6% of a company’s annual turnover, as well as the imposition of remedies such as an app redesign. TikTok does not publish its revenues, but according to estimates from the World Advertising Research Centre it will post revenues of $35bn (£26bn) this year.\n\nTikTok said it rejected the commission’s findings. “The commission’s preliminary findings present a categorically false and entirely meritless depiction of our platform, and we will take whatever steps are necessary to challenge these findings through every means available to us,” a spokesperson for the company said.\n\nLast year Elon Musk’s X was fined €120m (£104m) for a breach of the DSA in the first-ever fine under the legislation. The breaches included what the EU said was a “deceptive” blue-tick verification badge given to users, and impeding research around what adverts the platform had hosted.",

    "fullText": "While copyright and licensing currently form the core legal \nstructures that support Free Software, a September 2025 ruling from the \nSpanish Supreme Court provides a legal precedent that underlines the \nimportance of transparency in source codes and algorithms, and support \nfor the Freedom to Study!\n\nIn 2009, the Spanish central government passed a law to\naward a so-called “social bonus” to an estimated 5 million\nhouseholds, in order to subsidise their electricity costs. A 2016 court\nruling later compelled the government to introduce stricter rules\nregulating who could receive this social bonus. All existing\nbeneficiaries were required to re-register by the end of 2018, whereupon\ntheir eligibility for the social bonus would be re-evaluated by a\nsoftware known as BOSCO, administered by the Spanish Ministry for Green\nEnergy Transition (the “Ministry”).\n\nFollowing this re-evaluation, close to 1.5\nmillion beneficiaries were approved for the social bonus. This was\nalmost a million fewer than the 2.4 million under the previous scheme,\nand significantly less than the estimated 4.5 million who fulfilled the\ncriteria to receive the social bonus in the first place. Several\napplicants who had been rejected contacted Civio, a non-profit based in Madrid that\nworks to investigate\nshortcomings in the public sector and advocate for positive changes\nto support transparency and social support, raising suspicions that the\nBOSCO software had failed to properly review their claims.\n\nAs highlighted by AlgorithmWatch,\none of the complaints to Civio involved a retired widower who applied\nfor the social bonus under means testing. Under the regulations, she\nwould still be eligible for the bonus due to her status as a retiree and\na widower, even if her income exceeded the maximum to be eligible under\nmeans testing. BOSCO nevertheless discarded her application\nautomatically.\n\nCivio therefore contacted the Ministry to ask for BOSCO’s source\ncode, in order to confirm the veracity of the testimonials that they had\nreceived, as well as to check for other malfunctions. In response, the\nCouncil\nof Transparency and Good Governance (the “Council”), Spain’s freedom\nof information authority, denied Civio’s request, on the grounds of\nprotection of “intellectual property rights”, and protection of personal\ndata. This in turn prompted Civio to file\nan administrative appeal, which kicked off the lengthy judicial\nprocess that concluded in September 2025 in the Supreme Court of Spain\n(the “Court”).\n\nThe Supreme\nCourt ruling displayed a general support of transparency and the\nFreedom to Study, by clearly stating that Civio’s initial request for\naccess to BOSCO’s source code should be granted. In doing so, the Court\nhas now established a concrete legal precedent in Spain that the Freedom\nto Study is constitutionally necessary in the context of publicly\nadministered software programmes a algorithms, and in accordance with\nprinciples inherent to a democratic state .\n\nExplaining its position, the Court stated that:\n\n“… the right to access to public information transcends its\nstatus as an objective principle governing the actions of public\nadministrations, to constitute a constitutional right that can be\nexercised, as a subjective right, against administrations, derived from\nthe demands of democracy and transparency, and inseparably linked to the\ndemocratic rule of law set out in Article 1 of our\nConstitution.”\n\nIn simpler terms, the Court’s analysis on the importance of public\ntransparency relating to software programmes and algorithms can be\nbroken down into the following key findings:\n\nIn reviewing Civio’s request for access to BOSCO’s source code, the\nCourt was quick to emphasise that the validity of public administrations\nto make use of automated decision-making systems was not in question.\nIndeed, it recognised that such automated processes were often essential\nfor efficiency and adequate provision of public services.\n\nRather, the Court stressed the need for the principle of transparency\nto continue to be observed even in the use of such automatic systems, as\nenshrined in Article 105.b of the Spanish\nConstitution. It is therefore a legal requirement in Spain for\npublic administrations to allow citizens to access fundamental features\nof the algorithms used in decision-making, or their source code.\n\nThe Court considered such transparency to be associated with an\nimportant broader concept that it called “digital or electronic\ndemocracy”:\n\n“Digital democracy is not only a technological extension of\nrepresentative democracy, but also the fruit of a real structural\ntransformation in the democratic functioning of public authorities,\ncharacterised by the validity of the principles of transparency,\nparticipation, and accountability in a digital environment, where access\nto public information and algorithmic transparency play an essential\nrole in guaranteeing it.”\n\nPublic authorities are therefore obliged to allow citizens to\nunderstand how algorithms used in decision-making that affect citizens\nwork. The Spanish Supreme Court considers that doing so would be inline\nwith the principles of digital democracy, in order to allow citizens to\nknow, control, and participate in public management.\n\nIn Spain, Article 14(1)(j) of the Spanish Law on\nTransparency, Access to Public Information and Good Governance (the\n“LTAIBG”) allows access of information to be limited if such access is\ndetrimental to what they referred to as “intellectual property rights”.\nIndeed, throughout the litigation of this case, the Ministry relied on\nthis provision to argue on the vague and unspecific claim that BOSCO’s\nsource code was protected generally by “intellectual property rights”,\nwhich gave the Ministry the option to refuse to share BOSCO’s source\ncode with Civio.\n\nSimilarly, Article 14(1)(a) of the LTAIBG restricted access of public\ninformation on national or public security grounds, and was also relied\non by the Ministry in its arguments to refuse access to BOSCO’s source\ncode.\n\nThe Court found that, while the right to access of public information\nis neither unlimited nor absolute, the restrictions stated in the LTAIBG\nmust be applied in a manner that is justified and proportionate. This in\nturn has to be decided by a weighing of the interests at stake, namely\nthe importance of the access to public information on the one hand, and\nthe importance of protecting the rights of the copyright holders of\nBOSCO, or of any national security concerns, on the other. Indeed, it\nconsidered that while copyright and security concerns are important\nconsiderations, they cannot be invoked as automatic shields for\nsecrecy.\n\nWhen weighing these interests against each other, the Court gave\nparticular importance to Civio’s request for BOSCO’s source code. It\nrecognized that the public relevance of Civio’s investigation into\nwhether BOSCO was functioning correctly was of significant magnitude: it\nserved to ensure the protection of consumers who are in a more fragile\nsocial and economic situation, specifically in this case to protect them\nagainst energy poverty.\n\nAccordingly, the Court found that the mere risk of possible harm to\nthe “intellectual property rights” of the public administration was not\nsufficiently important enough to be considered valid grounds for\nrefusing Civio’s right of access, when weighed against the significance\nof Civio’s investigation.\n\nSimilarly, when considering possible risks to public security, the\nCourt found that a request for source code and algorithmic transparency\ndoes not contain or include personal data of the citizens applying for\nthe social bonus. This was sufficient for the Court to consider that the\npublic interest for Civio to access BOSCO’s source code outweighed any\npublic security concerns.\n\nInterestingly, the Court further noted that even if access to BOSCO’s\nsource code could potentially increase certain security risks,\ntransparency itself can contribute towards counterbalancing this risk,\nsince it would:\n\nthat the right of access to public information takes on special\nrelevance in light of how digital technologies are exercised in the use\nof public powers and the provision of public services. Such use of\ncomputerized and automated decision-making systems in public\nadministration, especially when their purpose is the recognition of\nsocial rights, must necessarily entail transparency of the computer\nprocesses followed in such actions.\n\nThis kind of transparency, which the Court recognized to include the\npossibility of access to source code, has the effect of providing\ncitizens with the necessary information for their understanding and\nknowledge of their operation, in order to make it possible to check the\nconformity of such systems against the applicable regulatory\nprovisions.\n\nIndeed, the Court recognized that such fundamental principles of\ntransparency and access to public information in the public use of\ndigital technology are not just unique to Spanish jurisdiction, but are\nalso the logical extension of Article 42 of the Charter\nof Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the “CFR”):\n\n“Any citizen of the Union, and any natural or legal person residing\nor having its registered office in a Member State, has a right of access\nto documents of the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the\nUnion, whatever their medium.”\n\nThe Spanish Supreme Court’s conclusions in the BOSCO case clearly\nlays out the importance of transparency of source code and algorithms in\npublic administrations, and how they are important to the healthy\nfunctioning of societies that depend on digital technology. It is\ngratifying to see a European court clearly lay out how important it is\nto have public access to knowledge on how software and algorithms work,\nespecially when they have significant impact on the lives of individuals\nat large.\n\nNevertheless, while we appreciate the recognition of the importance\nof transparency in publicly administered source code by the Spanish\nSupreme Court here, this case only establishes this limited standard in\nSpain. While the aforementioned Article 42 of the CFR can be\ninterpreted to include algorithmic transparency and access to source\ncode used by public administrations, the interpretation taken by the\nSpanish Supreme Court is still not a unified stance seen throughout the\nEU.\n\nStill, some positive steps can be seen in other European\njurisdictions. For example, in France, the Digital Republic Law (\"Loi\npour une République numérique”) of 2016 codifies source code as part\nof government documentation that must be released in certain\ncircumstances. Of course, this does not necessarily mean that all\npublicly administered source code is immediately available in practice\nin France, as there have been cases in the past of the French\ncourts blocking access even after the Digital Republic Law came into\nforce.\n\nThere also remain other EU jurisdictions that are resistant to the\npublic access of state administered code. For example, in the\nNetherlands, the Debat\nDirect app, which allows the public to view livestreams of the\ndebates in the Dutch House of Representatives (Tweede Kamer), is only\navailable in the Apple, Google, and Microsoft app stores and is not\navailable under a Free Software licence. When FSFE Dutch volunteer Jos\nvan den Oever was unable to run the app on his devices and made a\nrequest for the Debat Direct source code from the Dutch parliament,\nthe resulting legal proceedings unfortunately resulted in a ruling that\nthe code should remain unavailable to the public.\n\nIn addition to the Freedom to Study, an informed and empowered\ncitizenry also needs other\nfreedoms that come with Free Software, in order to enjoy true\nsovereignty in our current society that is defined by its reliance on\ndigital technology. We therefore ask that the European courts take a\nleaf from the Spanish Supreme Court’s book in weighing the true social\ncosts of non-free publicly administered algorithms and programmes,\nespecially when faced with arguments for the mere sake of protection of\nintellectual property.\n\nIndeed, this is exactly why the FSFE’s Public Money? Public Code! (PMPC)\ncampaign has been working to ensure that this philosophy of\ntransparency, collaboration, and innovation in public administrations is\nupheld throughout Europe. Software used by public administrations have\nthe ability to closely affect the lives of the public, regardless of\nwhether or not these members of the public are users of the software.\nHaving such software be released as Free Software returns control of\npublic administration to the people, and is a crucial step to ensure\ndigital democracy.",

    "fullText": "A Los Angeles Superior Court judge denied UCLA’s attempt to force a lawsuit over its potential move from the Rose Bowl into arbitration.\n\nIn a ruling issued Tuesday, Judge Joseph Lipner rejected UCLA’s motions to compel arbitration and stay the case, clearing the way for the breach-of-contract lawsuit to proceed in court.\n\n“The court DENIES the motions to compel arbitration. The Court DENIES the motions to stay proceedings,” according to the minute order. “UCLA also filed a motion to quash deposition subpoenas and enter a protective order. The Court DENIES UCLA’s motion to quash.”\n\nIn addition to UCLA’s request, the judge also denied similar arbitration motions filed by Kroenke Sports & Entertainment LLC and StadCo LA LLC, both entities affiliated with SoFi Stadium.\n\nThe City and the Rose Bowl Operating Company welcomed the decision, saying the ruling clears the way for the case to move forward in court.\n\n“For more than forty years, UCLA has benefited from a unique partnership with the City of Pasadena and the Rose Bowl, a partnership that was memorialized in a carefully negotiated contract that extends through 2044,” the statement said. “That agreement was the foundation for hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer-backed investments made to modernize and preserve one of the most iconic sports venues in the world. In return, UCLA made a clear and binding commitment to play its home football games at the Rose Bowl through 2044 and expressly waived any right to terminate that commitment early, and we are confident that a court will agree.”\n\nUCLA is currently in a legal battle with the City of Pasadena and the Rose Bowl Operating Company. The city and the company sued the prestigious university to prevent the university from breaking its lease. UCLA is under contract with the Rose Bowl through 2044.\n\nThe post Judge Forces Arbitration in Multi-Million Dollar Rosel Bowl Lawsuit appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "description": "U.S. immigration agents in Oregon must stop arresting people without warrants unless there's a likelihood of escape, a federal judge ruled Wednesday.  U.S.",
    "fullText": "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — U.S. immigration agents in Oregon must stop arresting people without warrants unless there's a likelihood of escape, a federal judge ruled Wednesday.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mustafa Kasubhai issued a preliminary injunction in a proposed class-action lawsuit targeting the Department of Homeland Security's practice of arresting immigrants they happen to come across while conducting ramped-up enforcement operations — which critics have described as “arrest first, justify later.”\n\nThe department, which is named as a defendant in the suit, did not immediately comment in response to a request from The Associated Press.\n\nSimilar actions, including immigration agents entering private property without a warrant issued by a court, have drawn concern from civil rights groups across the country amid President Donald Trump's mass deportation efforts.\n\nCourts in Colorado and Washington, D.C., have issued rulings like Kasubhai’s, and the government has appealed them.\n\nIn a memo last week, Todd Lyons, the acting head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, emphasized that agents should not make an arrest without an administrative arrest warrant issued by a supervisor unless they develop probable cause to believe that the person is in the U.S. illegally and likely to escape from the scene before a warrant can be obtained.\n\nBut the judge heard evidence that agents in Oregon have arrested people in immigration sweeps without such warrants or determining escape was likely.\n\nThe daylong hearing included testimony from one plaintiff, Victor Cruz Gamez, a 56-year-old grandfather who has been in the U.S. since 1999. He told the court he was arrested and held in an immigration detention facility for three weeks even though he has a valid work permit and a pending visa application.\n\nCruz Gamez testified that he was driving home from work in October when he was pulled over by immigration agents. Despite showing his driver's license and work permit, he was detained and taken to the ICE building in Portland before being sent to an immigration detention center in Tacoma, Washington. After three weeks there, he was set to be deported until a lawyer secured his release, he said.\n\nHe teared up as he recounted how the arrest impacted his family, especially his wife. Once he was home they did not open the door for three weeks out of fear and one of his grandchildren did not want to go to school, he said through a Spanish interpreter.\n\nAfterward a lawyer for the federal government told Cruz Gamez he was sorry about what he went through and the effect it had on them.\n\nKasubhai said the actions of agents in Oregon — including drawing guns on people while detaining them for civil immigration violations — have been “violent and brutal,” and he was concerned about the administration denying due process to those swept up in immigration raids.\n\n“Due process calls for those who have great power to exercise great restraint,” he said. “That is the bedrock of a democratic republic founded on this great constitution. I think we’re losing that.”\n\nThe lawsuit was brought by the nonprofit law firm Innovation Law Lab, whose executive director, Stephen Manning, said he was confident the case will be a “catalyst for change here in Oregon.”\n\n“That is fundamentally what this case is about: asking the government to follow the law,” he said during the hearing.\n\nThe preliminary injunction will remain in effect while the lawsuit proceeds.",

The small fields out there throughout the course of the year, their players get full points.\"\n\nThe Spaniard added he believes \"there's work to be done\".\n\n\"While it's good for some people, it could cause some players to actually lose world ranking points instead of gaining them because finishing 11th is basically a missed cut, and we're already adding to the divisor.\n\n\"But I'm thankful that LIV Golf got their foot in the door, and there's a possibility for us to walk in the room and be recognised as a tour, as we should be.\"\n\nSetting out its reasons for the restrictions, OWGR said LIV Golf's eligibility failures included an average field size of 57 for 2026 versus the minimum of 75 set out in the ranking body's regulations and \"self-selection of players with players being recruited rather than earning their place on the tour in many cases\".\n\nLIV has described OWGR's stance as \"unprecedented\", saying someone finishing 11th in one of its events would be \"treated the same as a player finishing 57th\".\n\nThe circuit has also highlighted events such as the Hero World Challenge (20 players), and the PGA Tour's end-of-season play-off events the Tour Championship (30) and BMW Championship (49) - and the European DP World Tour Championship (52) - as having smaller fields and no cut but still receiving world ranking points for all participants.\n\nRahm was among six players, also including England's Tyrell Hatton, tied for fourth after the first round at Riyadh Golf Club on Wednesday.\n\nBelgian Thomas Detry claimed a share of the lead on his LIV debut.\n\nThe 33-year-old, whose most recent win came at the PGA Tour's Phoenix Open last February, shot a bogey-free seven-under-par 65 to tie Peter Uihlein.\n\n\"First day on the job, so a little bit of a change for me, so a bit nervous,\" said Detry, who is part of Dustin Johnson's 4Aces GC.\n\nAustralia's Elvis Smylie, another rookie, is one off the lead, with Rahm and Hatton in a group two back, while Bryson DeChambeau and Sergio Garcia are at four under.\n\nThe event also marks LIV's switch from a 54-hole format to 72.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk will have to sit for a deposition for lawyers to examine his role in dismantling USAID, a Maryland judge ruled.\n\nIn an eight-page order released on Tuesday, US District Judge Theodore Chuang rejected a request from Musk and officials linked to the Department of Government Efficiency to forgo a deposition.\n\nIt ordered him, along with former acting USAID director Peter Marocco and Department of State official Jeremy Lewin, to be deposed. Musk's legal team had tried to use the \"apex doctrine\" to avoid the deposition, a rule that allows high-ranking government officials to avoid depositions in some situations.\n\nThe deposition is part of a lawsuit against Musk and DOGE officials, filed by current and terminated USAID employees, who remain anonymous.\n\nChuang said that it was unclear whether Musk, Marocco, and Lewin were \"properly deemed to be high-ranking government officials.\"\n\nHe said most of the designated heads of the project were operating in informal or acting roles during the time when USAID was dismantled.\n\nIn the filing, Chuang added that Musk and the other officials failed to provide evidence as to why they chose to shut down the USAID headquarters and website, another reason the deposition was necessary.\n\nThe filing also listed Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Kenneth Jackson, a state department official, and Amy Gleason, a DOGE administrator, as defendants in the case.\n\nUSAID, the US Agency for International Development, distributes foreign aid and supports humanitarian causes globally. It was the top target for Musk-led DOGE at the start of President Donald Trump's second term last January.\n\nUSAID cuts were part of Musk's efforts to slash spending on government agencies that DOGE deemed wasteful. In February last year, USAID officials announced that the agency would cut its staff from 10,000 to just 300, furloughing the rest.\n\nMusk stepped back from DOGE in May.\n\nRepresentatives for Musk, USAID, and the Department of State did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge was skeptical of President Donald Trump’s argument to try to move the appeal of his hush money conviction to federal court — after lawyers already took their shot in two other courts.\n\nJudge Alvin Hellerstein suggested Trump’s attorneys missed their chance by first taking the US Supreme Court’s decision on presidential immunity to the state court judge who oversaw the criminal trial and not to a federal judge until almost two months later.\n\n“You made a choice. You sought two bites at the apple,” Hellerstein told Trump’s lawyers Wednesday.\n\nHe also quizzed Trump’s lawyer over the argument that the case should move to federal court because Trump could claim as a defense that he has immunity. Calling the arguments “provocative,” he said he would issue a ruling later.\n\nTrump’s attorneys are trying to get the appeal of his hush money conviction moved into federal court where the judges could interpret challenges involving federal preemption and presidential immunity. Removal would also plow a quicker path to have the appeal heard by the US Supreme Court.\n\nTrump was convicted in 2024 of 34 state charges of falsifying business records in connection with hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nDuring oral arguments on Wednesday, Hellerstein said Trump’s attorneys appeared to make a strategic decision to bring the Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity first to Judge Juan Merchan, the state judge who oversaw the trial, before trying to move the case to federal court which it did 58 days after the decision came down.\n\nJeffrey Wall, an attorney for Trump, pushed back against Hellerstein’s comment that he was trying to get another bite at the apple.\n\n“It would have been disrespectful in spades” to Judge Merchan if they bypassed him, Wall said. He said they had to move quickly before the state judge because Trump was set to be sentenced by him 10 days later.\n\nHellerstein said Trump’s attorneys missed the 30-day window allowed under the statute to move the case into federal court and their burden now was whether there was “good cause” to allow them to try again.\n\n“All your doing is saying your good cause is you’re afraid to anger the state court and you want to give the state court the first chance” to rule on the Supreme Court decision before trying the argument in federal court, the judge said.\n\n“You’ve made a strategic decision. You’re seeing where you can get a better decision and that is indicative of the intent,” the judge said.\n\n“My thesis is that was fatal to you,” Hellerstein said.\n\nTrump is simultaneously appealing his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records to influence the 2016 presidential election in state court. That appeal can ultimately be brought to the US Supreme Court but it has additional layers of review.\n\nHellerstein had previously rejected Trump’s effort to move the case into federal court, finding the argument that Trump had presidential immunity didn’t apply. Trump later tried again after the Supreme Court’s ruling on presidential immunity. He argued the use of evidence, including testimony from Trump’s former White House advisor Hope Hicks and his tweets while in office, were improperly used and his conviction should be overturned.\n\nAt the time Hellerstein denied that motion for removal, writing, “Private schemes with private actors, unconnected to any statutory or constitutional authority or function of the executive, are considered unofficial acts.”\n\nTrump appealed and in November the Second Circuit Court of Appeals sent it back to Hellerstein to conduct further analysis considering the Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity.\n\nOn Wednesday, Wall, the attorney for Trump, argued when the Manhattan district attorney’s office introduced evidence of what they argued were official acts — such as Trump’s tweets, trial testimony from his former White House aide Hope Hicks, and testimony about conversations Trump had with his attorney general — it changed the case and now it should be moved into federal court.\n\n“The district attorney held those keys in his hand. He didn’t have to introduce that evidence at trial to prove up his case. Once he did this became a prosecution relating to those official acts,” Wall argued.\n\n“Is that enough to make it a federal case? I think the answer to that is obviously yes,” Wall said.\n\nThe attorney added, “I don’t think you have to get to the bottom of this. It’s all for the Second Circuit.”\n\nWall said that the judge doesn’t have to decide the merits of the argument on immunity, only that they have what is called a “colorable defense” to move the case into federal court.\n\nSteven Wu, an attorney for the district attorney’s office, argued that a fight over evidence is not a defense to criminal charges.\n\n“The defendant seems to assume that because evidence of official acts is introduced that somehow transforms the nature of the criminal action. That’s just not true. The charges arise out of conduct that is wholly unofficial and private,” Wu said.\n\nDuring Wednesday’s argument, while the judge was skeptical of many of Trump’s legal arguments, he acknowledged a technical maneuver that appealed to him.\n\n“That’s a delicious thought because I then dump the whole problem on the Court of Appeals,” Hellerstein said.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A government lawyer who told a judge that her job “sucks” during a court hearing stemming from the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota has been removed from her Justice Department post, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nJulie Le had been working for the Justice Department on a detail, but the U.S. attorney in Minnesota ended her assignment after her comments in court on Tuesday, the person said. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel matter. She had been working for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement before the temporary assignment.\n\nAt a hearing Tuesday in St. Paul, Minnesota, for several immigration cases, Le told U.S. District Judge Jerry Blackwell that she wishes he could hold her in contempt of court “so that I can have a full 24 hours of sleep.”\n\n“What do you want me to do? The system sucks. This job sucks. And I am trying every breath that I have so that I can get you what you need,” Le said, according to a transcript.\n\nLe's extraordinary remarks reflect the intense strain that has been placed on the federal court system since President Donald Trump returned to the White House a year ago with a promise to carry out mass deportations. ICE officials have said the surge in Minnesota has become its largest-ever immigration operation since ramping up in early January.\n\nSeveral prosecutors have left the U.S. Attorney’s office in Minnesota amid frustration with the immigration enforcement surge and the Justice Department’s response to fatal shootings of two civilians by federal agents. Le was assigned at least 88 cases in less than a month, according to online court records.\n\nBlackwell told Le that the volume of cases isn't an excuse for disregarding court orders. He expressed concern that people arrested in immigration enforcement operations are routinely jailed for days after judges have ordered their release from custody.\n\n“And I hear the concerns about all the energy that this is causing the DOJ to expend, but, with respect, some of it is of your own making by not complying with orders,” the judge told Le.\n\nLe said she was working for the Department of Homeland Security as an ICE attorney in immigration court before she “stupidly” volunteered to work the detail in Minnesota. Le told the judge that she wasn't properly trained for the assignment. She said she wanted to resign from the job but couldn't get a replacement.\n\n\"Fixing a system, a broken system, I don’t have a magic button to do it. I don’t have the power or the voice to do it,\" she said.\n\nHomeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Le was a probationary attorney.\n\n“This conduct is unprofessional and unbecoming of an ICE attorney in abandoning her obligation to act with commitment, dedication, and zeal to the interests of the United States Government,” McLaughlin said in a statement.\n\nLe and the U.S. Attorney's office in Minnesota didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nKira Kelley, an attorney who represented two petitioners at the hearing, said the flood of immigration petitions is necessary because “so many people being detained without any semblance of a lawful basis.”\n\n“And there’s no indication here that any new systems or bolded e-mails or any instructions to ICE are going to fix any of this,” she added.",

    "description": "An attorney with the NCAA said Tennessee QB Joey Aguilar's \"sudden change of tune\" makes his request seem unnecessary. A Knox County judge had already granted it.",
    "fullText": "An attorney with the NCAA said Tennessee quarterback Joey Aguilar's \"sudden change of tune\" made his request for a temporary restraining order seem unnecessary. But the Feb. 4 filing came too late. A Knox County judge had already granted the request.\n\nAguilar was granted a temporary restraining order against NCAA eligibility rules by Chancellor Chris Heagerty on Feb. 4, the first step toward Aguilar’s potential return for the Vols in the 2026 season.\n\nHeagerty filed his decision at 8:22 a.m. NCAA attorney Taylor Askew didn’t file his motion until 9:14 a.m., according to the court filings.\n\nThe order gives Aguilar a 15-day window, prohibiting the NCAA from restricting his eligibility because he played junior college football before his Division I career. But it's just a short-term measure. The next step for Aguilar is to seek a preliminary injunction, which could extend his eligibility to the 2026 season. A hearing on the injunction is scheduled for Feb. 6.\n\nAguilar, 24, has spent seven years in college football, but only three seasons at NCAA member schools. That's why he is challenging the NCAA eligibility rules regarding junior college players.\n\nThe NCAA’s filing was specifically geared toward Aguilar not receiving the temporary restraining order, though the arguments go to the larger point of keeping him from obtaining another year of eligibility.\n\nHere are the NCAA’s reasons against the temporary restraining order:\n\nThe 2024 federal court ruling granting Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia another year of eligibility was meant to be “at to Pavia” alone and several similar requests in Tennessee have been denied including UT basketball’s Zakai Zeigler and UT baseball’s Alberto Osuna\n\nWhen Aguilar was part of the ongoing Pavia lawsuit, he didn’t request a temporary restraining order, just a preliminary injunction allowing him to play football this fall. “His sudden change of tune makes his current request for a TRO seem unnecessary.” Any cause for urgency is because Aguilar waited to file.\n\nIn a statement, reported by On3 after the temporary restraining order was granted, the NCAA said the order “illustrates the impossible situation created by differing court decisions …”\n\n“We will continue to defend the NCAA’s eligibility rules against repeated attempts to rob high school students of the opportunity to compete in college and experience the life-changing opportunities only college sports can create.\n\n“The NCAA and its member schools are making changes to deliver more benefits to student-athletes, but the patchwork of state laws and inconsistent, conflicting court decisions make partnering with Congress essential to provide stability for all college athletes.”\n\nHeagerty gave four reasons for the temporary restraining order:\n\nPlaintiff has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of his claim that the NCAA’s “JUCO rule” violated the Tennessee Trade Practices Act.\n\nImmediate and irreparable injury will result to the Plaintiff if the restraining order is not issued. Every day that Aguilar’s future remains uncertain leaves him unable to prepare for the next step of his career.\n\nThe balance of harms favor Plaintiff. The requested relief runs only to Aguilar. And the NCAA suffers no harm if Aguilar can play NCAA football for a fourth full season. The NCAA waived the JUCO rule for Aguilar and hundreds of other athletes in 2025.\n\nNo adequate remedy of law exists before a hearing can be had due to the time-sensitive nature of Plaintiff’s claim. Each day that passes leaves Aguilar unable to prepare and jeopardizes major career opportunities, lost time and opportunities that cannot be fully calculated or remedied with money damages.\n\nHeagerty is a well-respected chancellor who has served in that role since 2021. He received both his bachelor's and law degrees from University of Tennessee. He began teaching as an adjunct professor at the school’s Winston College of Law in the fall. All three Knox County chancellors have ties to the University of Tennessee at Knoxville.\n\nSports reporter Adam Sparks contributed to this report.\n\nTyler Whetstone is an investigative reporter focused on accountability journalism.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge said Tuesday that he knows of no U.S. Supreme Court precedent to justify the Pentagon's censuring of a sitting U.S. senator who joined a videotaped plea for troops to resist unlawful orders from the Trump administration.\n\nSen. Mark Kelly had a front-row seat in a courtroom as his attorneys urged U.S. District Judge Richard Leon to block the Pentagon from punishing the Arizona Democrat, a retired U.S. Navy pilot. Leon didn't immediately rule from the bench on Kelly's claims that Pentagon officials violated his First Amendment free speech rights.\n\nBut the judge appeared to be skeptical of key arguments that a government attorney made in defense of Kelly's Jan. 5 censure from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\n“You're asking me to do something the Supreme Court has never done,” the judge told Justice Department attorney John Bailey. “Isn't that a bit of a stretch?”\n\nBailey argued that Congress decided that retired military service members are subject to the same Uniform Code of Military Justice that applies to active-duty troops.\n\n“Retirees are part of the armed forces,” Bailey said. “They are not separated from the services.”\n\nBenjamin Mizer, one of Kelly's lawyers, said they aren't aware of any ruling to support the notion that military retirees have “diminished speech rights.” And he argued that the First Amendment clearly protects Kelly's speech in this case.\n\n“And any other approach would be to make new law,” Mizer added.\n\nLeon, who was nominated to the bench by Republican President George W. Bush, said the Pentagon's actions against Kelly could have a chilling effect on “many, many other retirees who wish to voice their opinion.”\n\nThe judge said he hopes to issue a ruling by next Wednesday. Kelly shook hands with two government attorneys after the hearing.\n\nIn November, Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers appeared on a video in which they urged troops to uphold the Constitution and not to follow unlawful military directives from the Trump administration.\n\nRepublican President Donald Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition “punishable by DEATH” in a social media post days later. Hegseth said Kelly’s censure was “a necessary process step” to proceedings that could result in a demotion from the senator’s retired rank of captain and subsequent reduction in retirement pay.\n\nThe 90-second video was first posted on a social media account belonging to Sen. Elissa Slotkin. Reps. Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander and Chrissy Houlahan also appeared in the video. All of the participants are veterans of the armed services or intelligence communities.\n\nThe Pentagon began investigating Kelly in late November, citing a federal law that allows retired service members to be recalled to active duty on orders of the defense secretary for possible court-martial or other punishment.\n\nHegseth has said Kelly was the only one of the six lawmakers to be investigated because he is the only one who formally retired from the military and still falls under the Pentagon’s jurisdiction.",

Musk, who is Tesla and SpaceX's CEO, launched a lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman in February 2024, accusing Altman of jeopardizing its nonprofit mission.\n\nMusk said that he contributed $38 million to OpenAI, thinking it would remain a nonprofit. He was one of the company's founders, along with Altman, PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel, and others.\n\nDespite OpenAI's attorneys' attempts to have the case thrown out, a California judge said in a January hearing that there was enough evidence to go to trial, which is set for April.\n\nThe billionaire duo have been trading barbs on social media. Musk attacked OpenAI's ChatGPT on January 20, writing \"Don't let your loved ones use ChatGPT.\" He was responding to an X post alleging that the chatbot has been linked to multiple deaths since 2022.\n\nAltman responded to Musk's post, slamming Tesla's Autopilot system as unsafe, and questioning xAI's Grok chatbot.

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge is set to hear arguments Wednesday after an appeals court directed him to take a fresh look at President Donald Trump’s bid to erase his hush money conviction.\n\nThe 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in November ordered U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein to reconsider his decision to keep the case in state court instead of moving it to federal court, where Trump can seek to have it thrown out on presidential immunity grounds.\n\nA three-judge panel ruled that Hellerstein erred by failing to consider “important issues relevant” to Trump’s request to move the New York case to federal court. They said they \"express no view” on how he should rule.\n\nTrump, a Republican, is not expected to attend Wednesday's arguments in federal court in New York City, which were preceded by lengthy written submissions from Trump's lawyers and the Manhattan district attorney's office, which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court.\n\nHellerstein, who was nominated by Democratic President Bill Clinton, has twice denied Trump’s requests to move the case.\n\nThe first was after Trump’s March 2023 indictment; the second followed Trump’s May 2024 conviction and a subsequent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that presidents and former presidents cannot be prosecuted for official acts.\n\nIn the later ruling, at issue in the 2nd Circuit decision, Hellerstein said Trump’s lawyers had failed to meet the high burden of proof for changing jurisdiction and that Trump’s conviction for falsifying business records involved his personal life, not official actions that the Supreme Court ruled are immune from prosecution.\n\nThe 2nd Circuit panel said Hellerstein’s ruling, which echoed his previous denial, “did not consider whether certain evidence admitted during the state court trial relates to immunized official acts or, if so, whether evidentiary immunity transformed” the hush money case into one that relates to official acts.\n\nThe three judges said Hellerstein should closely review evidence that Trump claims relate to official acts.\n\nIf Hellerstein finds the prosecution relied on evidence of official acts, the judges said, he should weigh whether Trump can argue those actions were taken as part of his White House duties, whether Trump “diligently sought” to have the case moved to federal court and whether the case can even be moved to federal court now that Trump has been convicted and sentenced in state court.\n\nTrump was convicted in May 2024 of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal a hush money payment to adult film actor Stormy Daniels, whose allegations of an affair with Trump threatened to upend his 2016 presidential campaign. He was sentenced to an unconditional discharge, leaving his conviction intact but sparing him any punishment.\n\nTrump denies Daniels’ claim and said he did nothing wrong. He has asked a state appellate court to overturn the conviction.",

It required 7-days’ warning for visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities being funded exclusively by the “Big Beautiful Bill” that Republicans passed last summer. That bill did not include the rider.\n\nCobb rejected the policy, crediting the lawmakers’ contention that it would be logistically difficult to segregate which expenses are being funded by which law.\n\n“Defendants’ declarant provides almost no details or specifics as to how DHS and ICE would accomplish this task in the face of the practical challenges raised by Plaintiffs,” wrote Cobb, an appointee of former President Biden.\n\nThe Hill has reached out to a DHS spokesperson for comment.\n\nThe suit was filed by 13 Democratic members of Congress: Joe Neguse (Colo.), Adriano Espaillat (N.Y.), Bennie Thompson (Miss.), Jamie Raskin (Md.), Robert Garcia (Calif.), Lou Correa (Calif.), Jason Crow (Colo.), Veronica Escobar (Texas), Dan Goldman (N.Y.), Jimmy Gomez (Calif.), Raul Ruiz (Calif.), Norma Torrez (Calif.) and Kelly Morrison (Minn.).\n\nTheir latest push in court came after the lawmakers said they tried to visit an ICE facility in Minnesota three days after the fatal shooting of Renée Good by a federal agent.\n\n“The Court’s decision today to grant a temporary restraining order against ICE’s unlawful effort to obstruct congressional oversight is a victory for the American people. We will keep fighting to ensure the rule of law prevails,” Neguse, a member of House Democratic leadership, said in a statement.\n\nThe lawmakers are represented by American Oversight and Democracy Forward Foundation, two organizations that regularly back lawsuits against the Trump administration.",

Jackson case that overturned the federal right to an abortion.\n\nThe court has also been rocked by revelations about disagreements among the justices, including a bitter debate about a case involving Idaho’s abortion ban, a battle over the court’s toothless ethics rules, and a confidential memo in which Roberts pushed to grant Trump broad immunity from prosecution.\n\nRoberts’ decision to impose NDAs came just weeks after the Times quoted from the confidential immunity memos, according to the Times.\n\nThe move comes as critics are calling for more transparency at the Supreme Court, which is facing record-low public trust as the conservative justices greenlight the vast majority of Trump’s policies.\n\nRoberts, however, went in the other direction and mandated more secrecy, not less.\n\nThe last time prior to 2024 that Supreme Court clerks were asked to sign a document agreeing to abide by the court’s confidentiality rules appears to have been in the late 1990s, after a former clerk published a tell-all book in 1998, according to the Times.\n\nThose documents, however, did not amount to legal NDAs, according to some of the clerks that signed them.\n\nThe switch to formal contracts is “a sign of the court’s own weakness” and the erosion of internal cohesion, Mark Fenster, a University of Florida law professor, told the Times.",

    "description": "Like so many Lafayette immigrant stories, Judge Randy Williams’ story involved a love and Purdue University.",
    "fullText": "Anyone who ever spent any time in Tippecanoe Superior 1 over the last 17 years likely noticed Judge Randy Williams’ upstate New York accent. Sometimes, it's hard to miss.\n\nEven though Williams has lived here for nearly 40 years, his accent persists.\n\nSo how does a New Yorker settle in small-town Indiana?\n\nLike so many immigrant stories of Lafayette transplants, Williams’ story involved a love and Purdue.\n\nAs a young attorney practicing first in Albany, New York, and later in his hometown of Rome, New York, Williams never imagined a career in a mostly quiet Midwestern city.\n\nThat was before he met and dated Shay Daley.\n\n“Shay came out here in the summer '87, starting with her master's program in clinical psychology,” Williams said, noting he was working for a law firm in Rome. “We had the long-distance thing going on.\n\n“And at one point, I think the suggestion was, ‘Well, why don't you move out here?’ And I said, ‘I'm not going to move out there unless we're married.’\"\n\nSo much for a surprise engagement.\n\n“We got engaged in March of '88, got married in July of '88,” Williams recalled.\n\nThey honeymooned, and then Williams moved to Lafayette, where he briefly lived the life of an unemployed lawyer.\n\n“Now, honestly, did I think I'd be here, you know, 37 years?” Williams rhetorically asked. “Once I did get here, there were a few (law) firms that thought, ‘Oh, you're just here. You're a short-timer, so why would we even bother?’ I think that was the attitude.”\n\nTo earn money, Williams started substitute teaching. During a world civics class, they were studying Rome — the empire in Europe and Africa, not his hometown.\n\nWhen he shared with the students he was from Rome, they started asking him how an unemployed attorney found himself substitute teaching in front of a Jefferson High School class. Long story short, one of the students, Annie Deets, was in the class.\n\nThe next day, Williams got a call from a local attorney and Annie Deets's father, Charles, who interviewed him and hired him.\n\nFor the next 17 years, Williams built his career here as an attorney, first at Deets law firm then at Ball Eggleston law firm.\n\n“Maybe at that point, I was thinking we'll stay around a while,” he joked of his early days in the community as he built his law practice.\n\nThrough the years, Williams and Daley bought a house, which was only supposed to be their five-year home, he said. They still live there today after more than 35 years. They became parents there to a daughter, Rachel, and a son, Sam.\n\nHe started an unofficial career as a soccer coach, first for his daughter's team, then for other teams. He'd played four years of soccer at Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, back in the 1970s when the game's popularity was low, so he knew more than most about the game.\n\nHe retired three times from coaching soccer before it finally stuck in 2020 during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nAs for notable cases while he was a defense attorney, none stands out, he said. “I was unassuming,” he joked.\n\nWilliams' law career took a turn in 2008.\n\n“It was time,\" Williams said of his run for Tippecanoe Superior 1 judge. \"There was a court that was going to be open, and I had done a lot of work in here as a (temporary) judge. I had tried cases. I had been reversed.\"\n\nWilliams didn't see running for judge as an entitlement or a calling.\n\n“There wasn't the thought that this is what I was was born and raised to do. It wasn't,\" he said. \"I thought I could help, I guess.\"\n\nRunning for public office required his family consent, he said.\n\n“There were family discussions because, you know, if your dad becomes a judge, you may hear things, you may read things, see things that you may not like. Is that something you'll be OK with?” he said recalling the family talks before his run for office.\n\nThrough the 17 years on the bench, Williams said most of the cases stand out for one reason or another, but he chose not to comment on any specific cases. In some, there might be post-conviction motions pending.\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, Jan. 16, friends, colleagues, peers and well-wishers stopped by the Superior 1 courtroom to celebrate Williams's retirement with him.\n\nIndiana Supreme Court Chief Justice Loretta Rush was among those who visited, as were defense attorneys, other judges, deputy prosecutors, bailiffs, and many of Williams's friends.\n\nSteve Meyer, who plans to retire as Tippecanoe Superior 2 judge next year, worked with Williams at the Ball Eggleston law firm, where they molded a friendship that continued in their respective roles as judges.\n\nMeyer attended Williams's retirement shindig Friday, Jan. 16 — two days before a gunman shot Meyer and his wife, Kim. Both are going to make a full recovery.\n\nBut the shooting, as well as Meyer's participation in this profile, made it seem necessary to postpone publishing this story until it was known whether Meyer and his wife would be OK.\n\nMeyer and Williams came up through their careers as defense attorneys.\n\nMeyer telephoned Williams on Jan. 20, two days after the shooting, Williams said last week.\n\n“It was like the weight of the world had been lifted from my shoulders to hear him,” Williams said. “It’s good to hear him.”\n\nThe shooting caused ripple effects for judges throughout the state, and Rush, a Lafayette resident, has spoken with the state's judges and justices about the situation.\n\nProsecutors allege that Meyer's shooting was a criminal gang activity intended to stop Thomas Moss' Jan. 20 trial on gun, domestic battery and criminal recklessness.\n\nCases are randomly assigned to courts, and Williams recognized that Meyer's shooting could have been happened to any judge to whom the case was assigned.\n\n“I don’t want to think about it too much,” Williams said about the random draw. “I’ll be a little more cautious now.”\n\nInitially, Williams wondered whether the shooting might be political because Meyer is the only Democrat judge.\n\n“You don’t know. You just don’t know,” he said, referring to the strife and division in society at this point in history. “It’s a scary thing.”\n\nThe judges have pulled together to keep Tippecanoe Superior 2 on track with hearings and trials.\n\n“We’re just so glad that he’ll be back. We don’t know when,” Williams said. “I think the judges have stayed strong and done a really nice job.\"\n\n“He's a good friend, and he's probably my closest friend in the local judiciary,” Meyer said during a Jan. 12 interview in his office.\n\n“He's a great sounding board because when things happen, I know I can always go to him and maybe run an idea by or discuss an issue, and he does the same with me,\" Meyer said in an interview before the shooting. \"I always get, I think, reliable, sound feedback that I appreciate.”\n\n“I'm actually going to miss seeing him on regular basis and miss his advice and sounding board,\" Meyer said.\n\nBefore Meyer became Judge Meyer, he at times defended clients in Williams's court.\n\n“I think he always had a pretty good temperament, pretty fair and balanced, and I always knew that I'd get a good hearing there,” Meyer said.\n\nTippecanoe County Prosecutor Pat Harrington became familiar with Williams while they were both up-and-coming defense attorneys.\n\n“He is a solid judge,\" Harrington said. “He is always consistent in his interpretation of the law, and he's always polite.”\n\n“Today we go into court on high-tech crime evidence, and some of the evidence comes in with the stipulation with the defense attorney because it's science,\" Harrington said.\n\nBefore cell-phone data and electronic data were accepted as science, legal precedent had to be set for how to admit that data into evidence.\n\n“The landmark case that set the legal standard for the high-tech crime unit's cell-phone, electronic data, it was his case,\" Harrington said. \"He made all those evidentiary decisions.\"\n\nThose decisions were upheld by the Indiana Supreme Court.\n\nBefore Williams's retirement celebration in his courtroom on Jan. 16, he was in his office boxing up decades of mementos, including those from his days coaching soccer and keepsakes from his lifelong passion for baseball and the New York Yankees.\n\nHarry Rocheville, a bailiff at the courthouse, a Boston Red Sox fan and a retired police officer from Salem, Massachusetts, walked into the office that afternoon with a box labeled \"Yankees Junk!\"\n\nRed Sox fans generally are not fond of the Yankees or their fans.\n\n“The only bad thing about Judge Williams is he’s a Yankees’ fan,” Rocheville jokingly said weeks earlier.\n\nIronically, Williams's son, Sam, turned out to be a Red Sox fan.\n\n'It wouldn't be a father-son relationship if we didn't have something like that,\" Williams joked.\n\nAs a kid, Williams watched his idol, famed New York Yankee Mickey Mantle, play in the 1960s, but he never was able to meet him. He has a baseball card collection that includes most, if not all, of Mantle's cards.\n\nWilliams admitted he's fortunate to have seen the Yankees play in every stadium they've had, and he has some treasured signed baseballs and a Yankees' ticket stub from the last season they used paper tickets.\n\nWilliams' love of baseball is well known by those who know him or visited his office.\n\nHe played shortstop during his four years at Hamilton College, and played summer ball when school wasn't in session.\n\nEven though he's lived in Lafayette for nearly 40 years, he still makes it back to watch the Yankees.\n\nWhen the Journal & Courier interviewed Williams in December, he pointed to a corner of his office, where he had a 5-foot wooden sculpture representing Babe Ruth.\n\n\"Shay got me that one year for Christmas,\" Williams said of the Babe Ruth sculpture. \"She said, 'It can't stay home.' So I had that over in my office over at Ball Eggleston.\"\n\nHe had no idea where he's going to put it now that he's retired.\n\nA bookcase on a wall in his office had a Yankees' cap hanging on one end and a pitted and scuffed batting helmet on the other end.\n\nWilliams' keepsake helmet is from his college days, and he was wearing it in practice when a loose pitch came his way.\n\n“I got beaned,” Williams said of the pitch that hit him in the side of the head. “We then changed to flaps.”\n\nOfficially, Williams is retired now, but he's still frequently in the office.\n\nUnofficially, he'll continue to be on the judicial benches in Indiana serving as a senior judge where needed. He also has a few Superior 1 cases he needs to tidy up.\n\nHe also plans to continue to teach at Purdue University. His wife, Shay, is not retiring, Williams said.\n\nThe voters will choose Williams's replacement in the November elections. Until then, Indiana Gov. Mike Braun appointed Kevin McDaniel to fill out his term. Before he was appointed, McDaniel filed to run for Tippecanoe Superior 1 judge.\n\nReach Ron Wilkins at rwilkins@jconline.com.

    "fullText": "At -125, Shohei Ohtani is breathing rarefied air at his current price.\n\nConsider last year, when he was the overwhelming preseason favorite to win NL MVP, and he was still only +150 by the end of March, per Sports Odds History. That was already crazy, because the shortest number we've generally seen in recent years is +200 or +300.\n\nBelow, we'll look at the early MLB odds for the 2026 season, and AL & NL MVP, as the likes of Alex Bregman (Chicago Cubs) and Kyle Tucker (Los Angeles Dodgers) have found new homes since our previous look.\n\nHere are the last 10 winners of the AL and NL MVP Award, with Shohei Ohtani leading the way as a four-time winner, with two in the AL and two in the NL. Only Frank Robinson has also won MVP awards in both leagues.\n\nBarry Bonds holds the record for most MVP awards (seven)\n\nThe New York Yankees have won the most MVPs in MLB history with 25, while the St. Louis Cardinals are second, leading all NL teams, with 21. No player for the Arizona Diamondbacks, New York Mets, or Tampa Bay Rays has ever won MVP.\n\nMost sportsbooks will display odds in the American format as listed above. When Goldschmidt ran away with the MVP award in 2022 his odds had a minus (-) sign ahead of the number for a large part of the season.\n\nThat means that a bettor in August had to wager $6,000 to win $100 by betting on Goldy to win MVP. Before the season starts, almost every player will have a plus (+) sign ahead of their odds.\n\nThat means a bettor would have profited $200 for a $100 wager on Ohtani before the season started.\n\nIf American odds aren't your thing, simply use a tool like our odds converter to switch the odds to decimal or fractional format. Most online sportsbooks also give you the option to change the odds format that you see.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

The complaint against U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg was dismissed on Dec.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal appeals court judge has dismissed a misconduct complaint filed by the Justice Department against a judge who clashed with President Donald Trump ’s administration over deportations to a notorious prison in El Salvador.\n\nThe complaint against U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg was dismissed on Dec. 19 by Jeffrey S. Sutton, chief judge of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals but the order only came to light this weekend.\n\nThe complaint stemmed from remarks that Boasberg, the chief judge in the district court in the nation’s capital, allegedly made in March 2025 to Chief Justice John Roberts and other federal judges at a judicial conference saying the administration would trigger a constitutional crisis by disregarding federal court rulings. The meeting took place days before Boasberg issued an order blocking deportation flights that Trump was carrying out by invoking wartime authorities from an 18th century law.\n\nIn the dismissal order, Sutton said the Justice Department never provided a listed attachment to provide proof of what Boasberg said or the context of the alleged statement at the closed-door conference.\n\n“A recycling of unadorned allegations with no reference to a source does not corroborate them. And a repetition of uncorroborated statements rarely supplies a basis for a valid misconduct complaint,\" said Sutton, who was appointed by President George W. Bush to the appeals court circuit that covers Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee.\n\nSpokespeople for the Justice Department and for Boasberg's court did not immediately return messages seeking comment.\n\nEven if Boasberg had made the comments, Sutton said it would not be “so far afield\" from topics discussed at the gathering and would not violate ethics rules. Sutton noted that Roberts' 2024 year-end report raised general concerns about threats to judicial independence, security concerns for judges and respect for court orders throughout the nation's history.\n\nThe misconduct complaint was filed with Judge Sri Srinivasan, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, but Srinivasan asked Roberts to transfer it to another appeals court circuit because it was still considering appeals related to the deportation case, according to the dismissal order. Roberts transferred it to the 6th Circuit, it said.",

    "fullText": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Utah Gov. Spencer Cox signed a bill Saturday that expands the state Supreme Court from five justices to seven as frustration has mounted among Republican lawmakers over a string of defeats before the tribunal.\n\nRepublican advocates for the change argued that it would help improve the court's efficiency. But legal experts said it could have the opposite effect and set a dangerous precedent at a time of tension between the branches of government. The state's judiciary did not ask for more justices on the high court.\n\nDemocrats, who were united in opposition to the bill, called timing suspicious. Last week the Legislature asked the court to overturn a redistricting ruling that gave Democrats a strong shot at picking up one of Utah’s four Republican-held congressional seats in the fall.\n\nNew justices could be in place when the court decides the fate of the congressional map.\n\nBecause the bill received approval from more than two-thirds of legislators, it took effect immediately after the governor signed it, allowing him to bypass a several-month waiting period to start adding justices.\n\nIn Utah, justices are appointed by the governor and approved by the state Senate. Justices in many other states are elected.\n\nMost states have five or seven Supreme Court justices, but a few have nine. Cox, a Republican, has said the additions would put Utah in line with other states of its size. He has denied that the policy is politically motivated, noting that Republican governors and senators have made all recent appointments.\n\nOnce he fills the new seats, Cox will have appointed five of the seven sitting justices.\n\nLast month Republican lawmakers took authority from state Supreme Court justices to select their own chief justice and gave that power to the governor.\n\n“Seven sets of eyes reviewing the most complex and difficult issues our state has ever faced is better than having only five sets of eyes,” said House Majority Leader Casey Snider, a Republican sponsor of the bill.\n\nJohn Pearce, who recently retired as associate chief justice, said this month that he doubted the change would make the court more efficient.\n\n“The more sets of comments you have to take into account, the longer the process takes,” Pearce said. “If what the Legislature is hoping to do is speed up the work of the court, it's going to be counterproductive.”\n\nTwo states — Arizona and Georgia — have added justices in the past decade after making similar arguments about efficiency.\n\nIn the first few years after Arizona grew its court in 2016, several past and present justices said it made things less efficient because more people had to review opinions before they could be published.\n\nArizona's court now issues slightly more rulings per year, while Georgia's issues slightly fewer than before.\n\nUtah Chief Justice Matthew Durrant told legislators on the opening day of the 2026 session that the court had “essentially no backlog” and urged them to add judges to lower courts, where the need is greater. Bill sponsors responded by adding some lower court judges and clerks.\n\nThe Utah State Bar has raised concern over the expansion and other proposals that it said would weaken the judiciary's independence. Among them is a bill that would create a new trial court with exclusive jurisdiction to hear constitutional challenges. The proposal would limit the ability of other judges and courts to block potentially unconstitutional state laws with injunctions.\n\nRepublicans have also been collecting signatures to try to place on the November ballot an initiative that would restore their ability to draw voting districts that deliberately favor a political party, a practice known as gerrymandering.\n\nLee reported from Santa Fe, New Mexico.",

    "fullText": "Jan 31 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court judge has dismissed a judicial misconduct complaint by U.S. Justice Department against a judge who clashed with President Donald ​Trump's administration over its move to deport several Venezuelans to El Salvador.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam ‌Bondi took the rare step in July of announcing the complaint against Chief U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington, D.C., alleging ‌he made improper comments about Trump during a meeting of the judiciary's policymaking body, the Judicial Conference.\n\nChief U.S. Circuit Judge Jeffrey Sutton of the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in a newly-released order dated December 19 said the alleged statements, even if true, would not violate judicial ethics rules.\n\nThe Justice Department did not ⁠respond on Saturday to requests for ‌comment. Boasberg, an appointee of Democratic former President Barack Obama, declined to comment.\n\nBondi announced the complaint days after Boasberg said he might initiate disciplinary proceedings against ‍Justice Department lawyers for their conduct in a lawsuit brought by Venezuelans challenging their removal to a Salvadoran prison.\n\nBoasberg in April concluded the administration appeared to have acted \"in bad faith\" when it hurriedly assembled three deportation flights ​on March 15, at the same time that he was conducting emergency court proceedings to assess ‌the effort's legality.\n\nThe DOJ's complaint focused on comments attributed to Boasberg by the conservative media outlet The Federalist during a meeting of U.S. Judicial Conference in March that was attended by Chief U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Roberts.\n\nThe Justice Department alleged Boasberg expressed his concern to Roberts and others that the administration would disregard court rulings and trigger \"a constitutional crisis.\"\n\nThe DOJ argued those comments ran afoul of the ⁠judicial code of conduct, and that Boasberg wrongly acted ​on his belief in the litigation over the Venezuelans, who ​were removed from the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nDue to potential conflicts among judges in D.C., Roberts transferred the complaint to the Cincinnati-based 6th Circuit's Judicial Council.\n\nSutton ‍said the DOJ lacked ⁠proof Boasberg made such statements, which even if uttered would not be improper during the judicial policymaking body's closed-door meeting.\n\n\"In these settings, a judge’s expression of anxiety about executive-branch compliance with ⁠judicial orders, whether rightly feared or not, is not so far afield from customary topics at these meetings—judicial independence, judicial ‌security, and inter-branch relations—as to violate the Codes of Judicial Conduct,\" Sutton wrote.",

    "fullText": "I previously wrote a post called “What Is Good Code? On the Illusion of Readability” where I discussed how subjective and context-dependent the formula “good code = readable code” really is.\n\nThe conclusion that people judge readability differently is fair enough. But if you trace the mechanics behind it — where that sense of “this is easy to read” actually comes from — you start to find some hints.\n\nSo that’s what this post is about. How humans understand code, and what makes certain forms of information feel easier to process.\n\nIn a 2020 fMRI study conducted at MIT, researchers observed which brain regions activate when programmers read code. The results were interesting.\n\nAccording to the study, reading code primarily activated the Multiple Demand Network — the region responsible for logical reasoning and complex cognitive tasks — rather than the language network. The language regions weren’t completely uninvolved, but the Multiple Demand Network response was dominant.\n\nPut simply, when our brains read code, they rely more on logical reasoning than language processing.\n\nThe study confirmed that five brain regions related to working memory, attention, and language processing showed pronounced activation during code comprehension. Meanwhile, Default Mode Network activity (the regions active when the brain is resting) decreased. In other words, reading code is a fairly expensive operation for the brain.\n\nSo far, this might seem unsurprising. But the more interesting findings come from the differences between experts and novices. Skilled developers showed lower overall brain activation levels when reading code. Not because they were trying less, but because they were processing more efficiently. Novice developers, on the other hand, showed widespread brain activation — meaning they were consciously processing nearly everything one piece at a time.\n\nNovices tended to read code like natural language text, top to bottom. Experts followed the program’s execution flow. Same code, fundamentally different processing.\n\nTo understand why some code reads easily while other code refuses to organize itself in your head, you need to know about working memory.\n\nIn 1956, cognitive psychologist George A. Miller published the famous paper “The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two”, revealing that human short-term memory capacity is roughly 7±2 items. Subsequent research has revised this downward — according to Cowan (2001) and others, the number of chunks that can be simultaneously held in working memory converges around 3–4. Though this figure can vary depending on the type of task, level of expertise, and modality of information.\n\nThink about what we load into our heads when reading code. The current value of a variable, the direction of control flow, the order of function calls, the state of the current scope — all of these occupy working memory slots. When those slots fill up, the brain struggles to take in new information. That’s the moment when you get that “this code feels complicated” sensation.\n\nTo put it in programming terms, working memory is like a fixed-size stack.\n\nReal working memory is a far more complex system than a stack, but the analogy works well enough for intuiting the key property: “there’s a capacity limit, and exceeding it causes things to break down.” The stack size is roughly 4, and exceeding it causes a stack overflow. In practice, the items occupying each slot aren’t uniform in size, and interference between items also occurs, so the exact number matters less than the fact that capacity is limited. And the moment that capacity hits its limit is exactly when you feel “this code is hard to read.”\n\nLet’s compare code that rapidly exhausts working memory with code that doesn’t.\n\nThis function isn’t wrong, but it demands too many things be held in the reader’s working memory simultaneously.\n\nThe condition on order.status, the check on order.items, the discount branching by customer.tier, the null check on the coupon, the domestic/international tax branching, the final price calculation — trying to fit all of this context into 3–4 slots is what makes the brain scream.\n\nIf we can break this context into appropriately sized units, we can save working memory slots needed to understand each operation.\n\nIn this version, the amount you need to hold in your head at each step is noticeably reduced. The behavior is identical, but by packaging information into consistent units, we control how much context occupies each working memory slot.\n\nWhen reading calculateDiscount, you only need to focus on discount logic. When reading processOrder, you can understand the overall flow without knowing each calculation’s implementation details. Each function is digestible within working memory’s capacity, which is why it feels easier to understand. This is also why proper abstraction at appropriate granularity matters in design. Of course, the reverse is also true — splitting things too finely means you spend working memory on jumping between functions and tracking context. The goal isn’t splitting for its own sake, but reducing how much you need to hold in your head at once.\n\nHere’s a natural question: if working memory only has about 4 slots, how on earth do we comprehend hundreds of lines of code?\n\nThe answer lies in a cognitive mechanism called chunking. Chunking means grouping multiple small units of information into a single meaningful cluster. According to research from the University of Zurich, chunking reduces working memory load by retrieving compressed chunk representations from long-term memory to replace individual element representations. The freed-up capacity is then used to process new incoming information.\n\nThink about phone numbers. Trying to remember 01012345678 as eleven individual digits would far exceed working memory capacity. But split it as 010-1234-5678, and you only need to remember three chunks. Better yet, if 010 is already familiar as “Korean mobile prefix,” it’s automatically processed as a single chunk, meaning you really only need to memorize two new chunks.\n\nThe same thing happens with code. Look at what happens when a skilled developer reads this:\n\nA novice developer has to load each individual element into working memory: the users variable, how .filter works, arrow function syntax, the u.isActive property access, how .map works, another arrow function…\n\nFor a skilled developer, users.filter(...).map(...) is recognized as a single chunk: “filter array then transform.” Having seen this pattern hundreds or thousands of times, they pull a stored chunk from long-term memory and use just one working memory slot. The remaining slots can be allocated to higher-level thinking like “why is this being filtered?” or “where does the result get used?”\n\nThis is the same principle that allows chess masters to glance at a board and grasp the entire situation. Chess masters don’t memorize individual piece positions one by one — they recognize familiar formation patterns as single chunks. That’s why they can quickly recall meaningfully arranged boards but perform no better than novices with randomly placed pieces.\n\nCode works the same way. Idiomatic code is easy to read not because it’s “correct,” but because it matches chunks already stored in the developer’s long-term memory.\n\nAnd what makes a pattern idiomatic is shaped by external factors: the language’s design intent, standard library conventions, and the community’s repeated choices. It’s not simply “familiar because it’s used a lot” — it’s that convergence driven by multiple forces created that familiarity. This is also why project-specific unique patterns or overly creative code are hard to read. When existing chunks don’t match, the brain has to decompose everything into individual elements for processing, and working memory saturates almost instantly.\n\nThis is where Daniel Kahneman’s dual process theory becomes relevant. Kahneman divided human thinking into two systems:\n\nMost of our everyday judgments are handled by System 1. Driving a car, or sensing your partner’s mood from a single word over the phone — that’s all System 1. When encountering new information, System 1 doesn’t create entirely new patterns; it matches against patterns already stored.\n\nWhen System 1 gets stuck, that’s when System 2 gets called in. The moment you consciously think “what is this?” and begin analyzing — that’s System 2 engaging. And when you apply this framework to code reading, it explains a remarkable amount.\n\nReadable code is code that’s mostly processed by System 1’s pattern recognition, with minimal System 2 involvement.\n\nWhen skilled developers read code, familiar patterns are handled automatically by System 1. for loops, if-else branches, map/filter/reduce chaining, try-catch blocks — these have been seen thousands of times, so they’re processed without conscious effort. System 2 stays in a comfortable low-power mode, simply approving the information that System 1 surfaces.\n\nBut when an unexpected pattern appears, things change.\n\nBoth express the same intent. But the moment you see the second version, System 1 sends an “I don’t know” signal, and System 2 begins its expensive analysis. You have to unwind the double negation, run De Morgan’s law in your head, and figure out why that final undefined check is necessary. This transition itself is a cognitive cost.\n\nKahneman called this phenomenon cognitive strain. The more System 2 intervenes, the more energy the brain consumes and the more fatigue it experiences. The subjective feeling of “hard-to-read code” is really the cognitive cost arising from pattern matching failure triggering a system switch.\n\nFrom this perspective, feedback like “this is hard to understand” in code reviews isn’t just a matter of taste — it’s closer to a signal that system-switching costs are actually occurring. The magnitude of that cost varies by individual experience and chunk composition, but the fact that the cost occurs is real.\n\nReadable code depends not only on logical structure but on visual structure as well. This is where the perceptual principles of Gestalt psychology come in.\n\nGestalt psychology studies how the human brain prioritizes perceiving overall patterns and structures over individual elements. Several of its core principles connect directly to code readability.\n\nElements that are close together are perceived as a group. Let’s look at two versions of the same code to see why this grouping matters.\n\nThe second version just adds a single blank line, yet the brain automatically recognizes two groups: “user info processing” and “permission-based data retrieval.”\n\nAccording to Gestalt research, proximity is an even stronger grouping cue than similarity of color or shape. This principle is used directly in UI design — related information is placed close together and unrelated information is spaced apart, precisely for this reason.\n\nSimilarly, the reason blank lines and indentation matter in code isn’t just aesthetics — it’s because the brain’s perceptual system uses them to parse structure.\n\nLike proximity, elements that look alike are also perceived as belonging to the same group. This explains why consistent naming matters in code.\n\nIn the first version, despite all three being the same kind of operation — data fetching — the naming conventions are inconsistent. userData, get_orders, pmtHistory each have different forms, and fetchUser, retrieveOrderList, loadPayments lack any consistency. The brain can’t recognize these as the same group and processes each line as a separate item, consuming working memory.\n\nIn the second version, the pattern is clear. The consistent fetch + resourceName structure causes all three lines to be recognized as a single chunk: “data fetching in the same pattern.”\n\nThe law of continuity states that we perceive elements as a single continuous entity when they follow a natural flow of direction. In code, this relates to the linearity of execution flow.\n\nOur brains find top-to-bottom, left-to-right flow natural. Deep nesting, complex callbacks, and scattered goto statements are hard to read because they violate the law of continuity.\n\nThis is also why early return patterns feel easier to read than nested if statements. Once edge cases are filtered out, the remaining code flows in a single direction from top to bottom.\n\nThe first version forces your eyes to zigzag right and left as indentation deepens. The brain has to maintain “which condition am I currently inside” in working memory at each nesting level.\n\nThe second version filters out exceptions first, then flows naturally from top to bottom. Because it aligns with the law of continuity, the cost for the brain to parse the structure drops significantly.\n\nThere’s a framework that systematically organizes everything discussed so far: John Sweller’s Cognitive Load Theory.\n\nAccording to this theory, cognitive load during learning or problem-solving breaks down into three types:\n\nAccording to this theory, what we should pursue when writing readable code is minimizing extraneous load.\n\nIntrinsic load can’t be reduced — it’s inherent to the problem. Code implementing a distributed consensus algorithm will be complex no matter how well it’s written. The problem to avoid is when extraneous load from “how it’s expressed” piles unnecessarily on top of intrinsic load.\n\nFrom this perspective, patterns that improve readability — consistent naming, appropriate function decomposition, clear type declarations, meaningful blank lines — are all acts of reducing extraneous cognitive load. They let the brain’s limited resources avoid being wasted on extraneous load and focus on processing intrinsic load (the actual problem).\n\nA 2023 systematic literature review found something interesting as well. Among studies investigating the relationship between source code metrics and actually measured cognitive load, few traditional code metrics showed consistently high correlation with actual cognitive load, and even when correlation was found, results tended to vary depending on task conditions and measurement methods. In other words, what we “measure” as complexity and what a developer’s brain actually “feels” as complex can be different things.\n\nThis is a significant finding. Mechanically measurable metrics capture a code’s surface-level complexity, but the cognitive load a developer’s brain actually experiences is influenced by subjective perception — pattern familiarity, chunking efficiency, and visual structural clarity.\n\nI mentioned earlier that expert and novice brain activation patterns differ. This isn’t just “more experience means you get better.” A 2024 study published in Scientific Reports measured brainwaves from 62 Python programmers while observing their neural responses to intentionally inserted syntax errors and semantic errors in code.\n\nThe results were striking. Skilled programmers showed distinct brainwave patterns for syntactic violations versus semantic violations. This parallels how the brain produces different brainwave responses to grammatical errors versus semantic errors when reading natural language. It means that programming experience forms neural circuits in the brain specialized for processing specific languages and patterns.\n\nIn other words, coding experience physically changes the brain’s structure. Through neuroplasticity, code patterns encountered repeatedly are stored as schemas in long-term memory, and these schemas become the foundation for chunking. System 1’s ability to automatically process code is the result of accumulated schemas.\n\nFurthermore, because schemas form based on the patterns an individual has been exposed to, people who repeatedly encounter the same patterns in the same codebase end up sharing similar schemas. Flip this around, and maintaining a consistent code style within a team isn’t a matter of taste — it’s the process of forming shared chunks in team members’ brains. The reason coding conventions matter isn’t just uniformity; it’s collective cognitive efficiency.\n\nOne of the theories gaining attention in recent cognitive science is predictive coding. According to this theory, the brain doesn’t passively receive information — it constantly predicts what information will come next and only performs additional processing when the actual input differs from its prediction.\n\nThe same applies when reading code. Our brains constantly predict what the next line will be.\n\nA skilled developer’s brain reading this code is already predicting “it’ll probably parse the response data and return it.” And when return response.data; actually appears, the prediction was correct, so virtually no additional cognitive cost is incurred.\n\nBut what if something completely unexpected shows up?\n\nWhat the brain predicted from the name fetchUserProfile was “a function that fetches a user profile and returns it.” But then event bus emission, localStorage writes, and analytics tracking appear — actions outside the prediction. Each time, the brain generates a prediction error signal and invokes System 2 to analyze why this code is here.\n\nThe reason the second version feels hard to read is that the function is named fetchUserProfile, but internally it does things that have nothing to do with that name. The more closely a name’s set expectation matches the actual behavior, the fewer prediction errors occur and the less cognitive cost is incurred.\n\nThis applies not just within functions but to interface design as well. Let me use component interfaces familiar to frontend developers like myself as an example.\n\nThe first component follows value, onChange, placeholder — an interface shared by virtually every input component in the React ecosystem. A developer’s System 1, having encountered this pattern countless times, processes it as “it’s an input component” and moves on.\n\nThe second uses user, setUser, blank — an interface either tightly coupled to business logic or with unclear meaning. Until you figure out which fields of the user object it touches internally and when blank is actually used, you can’t use it with confidence. You have to look at the internal implementation every time, and each time, prediction errors occur.\n\nIn other words, to write readable code, we need to maximize predictability at every level of the codebase — not just function names, but variable names, file structure, directory organization, and API design.\n\nSummarizing everything so far, the substance behind the subjective feeling of “readable code” is this:\n\nLooking at this list, you’ll notice something interesting. None of these mean “correct code.”\n\nReadability and correctness are separate axes. Code can be perfectly correct but impossible to read, and code can be easy to read but wrong. That said, readable code also makes bugs easier to find — with lower extraneous load, the brain can focus its resources on finding logical errors.\n\nThere’s one caveat, though. Kahneman also warned about System 1’s biases. System 1 is fast, but that speed comes at the cost of bias. A classic example is familiarity bias. It’s true that you feel patterns familiar to you as “readable code,” but whether that’s objectively optimal is a separate question. A developer fluent in functional programming might find for loops “hard to read,” and vice versa. In those cases, the feeling of “hard to read” may not reflect the code’s objective quality but the bias of chunks stored in your own System 1.\n\nWhen giving “this is hard to understand” feedback in code reviews, it’s worth asking yourself once: is this genuinely high-cognitive-load code, or is it simply a pattern not registered in my System 1? If the former, refactoring is needed. If the latter, it might actually be an opportunity to expand your chunk library.\n\n“Readable code” isn’t just a matter of feeling or taste. It’s a natural outcome produced by human cognitive architecture — working memory capacity limits, chunking mechanisms, dual process systems, Gestalt perceptual principles, and predictive coding.\n\nThe reason I said “readability is subjective” in my previous post comes down to exactly this. Chunking depends on individual experience, and the patterns registered in System 1 differ from person to person.\n\nWhen two people look at the same code and one finds it easy while the other finds it hard, it’s not just a difference in taste — it’s because the schemas accumulated in their brains are different. The very reason readability is inevitably subjective is embedded in our cognitive structure.\n\nMany developers stop their thinking at “good code is readable code.” But if readable code is the answer, then what exactly is readable code? That’s a question worth asking yourself, and exploring in depth. Stopping your thinking in a vague domain is the most dangerous thing of all.\n\nWhat Happens in the Brain When We Read Code\n\nChunking: The Brain’s Data Compression Algorithm\n\nSystem 1 and System 2: Intuition and Analysis\n\nGestalt Principles: How Visual Structure Affects Code Comprehension\n\nCognitive Load Theory: Three Types of Load\n\nExperience Physically Changes the Brain\n\nPredictive Coding: The Brain Doesn’t Read Code — It Predicts\n\nSo What Is “Good Code,” Really?",

In Philadelphia, the materials were put in a pickup truck and then into storage, leading Rufe to voice concerns about whether they were damaged.\n\n“Although many people feel strongly about this (exhibit) one way, other people may disagree or feel strongly another way,” said Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregory in den Berken.\n\n“Ultimately,” he said, “the government gets to choose the message it wants to convey.”\n\n“That is a dangerous statement you are making. It is horrifying to listen to,” she said. “It changes on the whims of someone in charge? I’m sorry, that is not what we elected anybody for.”\n\nRufe heard hours of testimony Friday from former city officials who had helped plan the exhibit, and said the city had kicked in $1.5 million toward the project. She plans to visit both the storage area and the site before ruling on the city’s request to have the exhibit restored. But she asked the Justice Department lawyers to ensure that nothing else is disturbed.\n\nIn den Berken said the Park Service routinely changes its exhibits and tours, and argued that the government cannot be forced to tell a certain story. But lawyers for the city and other advocates said the park service does not have “carte blanche” to interpret the nation’s history as it sees fit.\n\nThe exhibit includes biographical details about the nine people enslaved by George and Martha Washington at the presidential mansion. Now, only their names — Austin, Paris, Hercules, Christopher Sheels, Richmond, Giles, Oney Judge, Moll and Joe — remain engraved into a cement wall.\n\nMichael Coard, an attorney representing one of the advocacy groups supporting the exhibit, said the president was ignoring the power held by Congress, the judiciary and the American people.\n\n“It’s one thing to whisper that type of dictatorial power. But to send lawyers into a public courtroom to make that argument is absolutely frightening,” he said. “I'm really worried about the state of America.”\n\nRufe said she planned to rule quickly, noting the surge of visitors expected to visit the nation's birthplace this year to mark its 250th anniversary of being founded.\n\nResidents who have visited the site have shed tears, left flowers and left a handmade sign that said “Slavery was real.”",

    "fullText": "PANAMA CITY (AP) — Panama's president moved to assure the public on Friday that critical ports at both ends of the Panama Canal will continue to operate without interruption — a day after the country’s Supreme Court ruled that the concession held by a subsidiary of Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison Holdings was unconstitutional.\n\nThe court's decision late Thursday advances a U.S. aim to block any influence by China over the strategic waterway and immediately drew a sharp rebuke from Beijing.\n\nPanamanian President José Raúl Mulino said that until the court's ruling is executed — a period of time he did not specify — Panama's Maritime Authority would work with Panama Ports Company, the CK Hutchison subsidiary, to ensure continuing operations at the port.\n\nOnce the concession is formally ended, a local subsidiary of Danish logistics company A.P. Moller-Maersk will operate the ports in a transitional phase until a new concession can be bid and awarded, Mulino said.\n\n“Panama moves forward, its ports will continue operating without interruption and we will continue serving the world at the logistics center of excellence that we are,” Mulino said in a recorded video address.\n\nThe court’s ruling followed an audit by Panama’s comptroller, which alleged irregularities in the 25-year extension of the concession, granted in 2021.\n\nThe Trump administration made blocking China’s influence over the Panama Canal one of its priorities in the hemisphere. Panama was U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s first overseas stop as the United States’ top diplomat. On Friday, Rubio said on X that “the United States is encouraged by the recent Panamanian Supreme Court’s decision to rule port concessions to China unconstitutional.”\n\nDespite the insistence by Panama’s government and the canal authority that China has no influence over its operations, Rubio made clear that the U.S. viewed the operation of the ports as a national security issue. U.S. President Donald Trump had gone so far as to say Panama should return the canal to U.S. control.\n\nThe court’s brief statement gave no guidance on what would happen to the ports now.\n\nThe ruling draws backlash from Hong Kong\n\nCK Hutchison’s subsidiary, Panama Ports Company, said it has not been notified yet about the decision but insisted its concession was the result of transparent international bidding.\n\nIt said in its statement that the ruling “lacks legal basis and jeopardizes not only PPC and its contract, but also the well-being and stability of thousands of Panamanian families who depend directly and indirectly on port activity, but also the rule of law and legal certainty in the country.”\n\nIt said that it reserves all rights to proceed legally in Panama or elsewhere, but gave no more details.\n\nThe Hong Kong government firmly rejected the ruling in a statement, saying it strongly opposes any foreign government using coercive, repressive or other unreasonable means to seriously harm the business interests of Hong Kong enterprises. It said the Panamanian government should respect the spirit of contracts and provide a fair business environment.\n\n“Given the current situation in Panama, Hong Kong enterprises should carefully review their existing and future investments there,\" it said.\n\nIn Beijing, China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, told reporters that China would take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of “the Chinese company,” without elaborating on the potential steps.\n\nPolitical analyst Edwin Cabrera said once the parties are notified, the issue of what to do with the ports goes to Panama’s executive branch, specifically the Panama Maritime Authority.\n\n“I have the impression from conversations that I have had with some people that the operation (of the ports) will not stop,” Cabrera said.\n\nA sale deal that apparently angered Beijing\n\nCK Hutchison Holdings announced a deal last year to sell its majority stake in the Panamanian ports and others around the world to an international consortium that included BlackRock Inc. But the deal appeared to stall over objections by the Chinese government.\n\nThe company said last July that it was considering seeking a Chinese investor to join as a significant member of the consortium, a move that some interpreted as way to please Beijing, but CK Hutchison hasn't said more since.\n\nThe awkward position the company found itself in highlights the challenges Hong Kong business elites face in navigating Beijing’s expectations of national loyalty, especially when relations between China and the United States are strained. CK Hutchison is owned by the family of Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing.\n\nLast year, Panama’s comptroller audited the concession to the Panama Ports Company, which had held the contract to operate the ports since 1997. The concession was renewed in 2021 for 25 years, during the prior Panamanian administration.\n\nComptroller Anel Flores said the audit found payments that were not made, accounting errors and the apparent existence of “ghost” concessions operating within the ports since 2015. The company denied those allegations.\n\nThe audit determined that the irregularities had cost the government about $300 million since the concession was extended and an estimated $1.2 billion during the original 25-year contract.\n\nFlores also said the extension was granted without the required endorsement of his office.\n\nOn July 30, the comptroller challenged the Panama Ports Company’s contract to operate the ports before the Supreme Court.",

    "fullText": "A law enforcement agency executing the Trump administration's immigration crackdown has been described as a serial violator of court orders in Minnesota.\n\nThe declaration didn't come from the Democratic governor or Minneapolis' Democratic mayor, who have repeatedly traded barbs with President Donald Trump. It was a federal judge with a conservative pedigree who has added a powerful voice to a saga that has stirred the nation.\n\n“ICE is not a law unto itself,” Chief U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz wrote this week, referring to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nSchiltz wasn't referring to the tactics of immigration officers, who have killed two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis, burst into homes with battering rams, smashed windows and pulled people from cars, and tossed tear gas at irate protesters.\n\nRather, after surveying other judges in his court, Schiltz was talking about the government's failure to comply with nearly 100 court orders since Jan. 1 in 74 cases in which people arrested during Operation Metro Surge have sued seeking release or other relief. Even that number, he said, is \"almost certainly substantially understated.\"\n\n“This list should give pause to anyone — no matter his or her political beliefs — who cares about the rule of law. ... ICE has every right to challenge the orders of this Court, but, like any litigant, ICE must follow those orders unless and until they are overturned or vacated,” Schiltz wrote.\n\nTricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Homeland Security Department, called Schiltz's declaration a “diatribe from this activist judge.\"\n\n“We will not be deterred by activists either in the streets or on the bench,” she said in a statement.\n\nDeputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller also slammed the judge’s comments on social media: “The judicial sabotage of democracy is unending.”\n\nSchiltz is among several judges who have called out the federal government and tried to keep officials accountable during a remarkable surge of immigration enforcement. U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez prohibited officers from using tear gas or pepper spray against peaceful protesters in Minnesota, though an appeal has put it on hold.\n\nIn November, a Chicago federal judge put similar limits on the use of force and said a Border Patrol commander lied about threats faced by officers. An appeals court halted the remedy, and the lawsuit was recently dropped as tensions eased.\n\nSchiltz, 65, has been a judge for about 20 years after being nominated by Republican President George W. Bush. He served as a law clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a noted conservative jurist, and was a practicing attorney and law professor.\n\n“This is not a judge who courts controversy,” said Mark Osler, a former federal prosecutor who teaches law at the University of St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis.\n\n“He has a deep belief in the rule of law,\" Osler said. “Our social contract includes that when government officials are ordered by the courts to do something, there should be a good faith effort to make that happen. When we lose that we lose the accountability for government that an ordered society requires.\"\n\nOn Monday, Schiltz said he was taking the “extraordinary” step of ordering ICE's acting director, Todd Lyons, to appear and explain why he should not be held in contempt for the agency's failure to comply with orders. The Department of Homeland Security responded by calling him an “activist judge.” Schiltz canceled the hearing after an immigrant in that case was released.\n\nSchiltz acknowledged to Fox News Digital that he has donated to Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, which gives free counsel to immigrants, and Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid. He said he believes poor people should get access to legal help.",

    "fullText": "Luigi Mangione will not face the death penalty in the 2024 ambush shooting and murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, a federal judge ruled on Friday.\n\nIn a written order issued an hour before a scheduled hearing in her Manhattan courtroom, US District Judge Margaret M. Garnett dismissed the two death penalty-eligible counts against Mangione.\n\nInstead, Mangione will face two fatal stalking counts at a trial that could begin in October: crossing state lines to cause Thompson's death, and using the internet to plan and carry out the CEO's death.\n\nBoth charges carry a maximum possible punishment of life in prison without parole.\n\nIn her order, Garnett used the word \"absurdity\" to describe the \"legal infirmities\" of the two charges she dismissed.\n\nBoth charges had required proof of stalking as being, in itself, a crime of violence, a requirement she said prosecutors failed to demonstrate.\n\nDuring the months he allegedly planned the murder, Mangione failed to place the CEO \"in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily harm\" or cause him \"emotional distress,\" as required by the statute, she wrote.\n\nThompson was unaware of Mangione's actions prior to being shot from behind outside a Manhattan hotel on December 4, 2024, according to prosecutors' own account of the killing.\n\n\"The stalking offenses charged in counts one and two are not 'crimes of violence' as a matter of law, and counts three and four must be dismissed,\" she wrote.\n\nProsecutors said Friday that they have not decided if they will appeal the judge's ruling.\n\nUS Attorney Pam Bondi announced in April that prosecutors will seek the death penalty.\n\n\"Luigi Mangione's murder of Brian Thompson — an innocent man and father of two young children — was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America,\" Bondi wrote then.\n\n\"After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump's agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again.\"\n\nIn a separate ruling Friday morning, the judge said she would allow the jury to see the most serious evidence against Mangione: The contents of his backpack, which, upon his arrest, contained a gun and a journal linked to the killing.",

    "description": "Luigi Mangione will not face the death penalty after a U.S. judge on Friday dismissed murder and weapons charges against the accused",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Luigi Mangione will not face the death penalty after a U.S. judge on Friday dismissed murder and weapons charges against the accused killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian ​Thompson, in a major blow to federal prosecutors.\n\nU.S. District Judge Margaret Garnett in Manhattan said she felt constrained by Supreme ‌Court precedents to dismiss the murder charge, saying it was legally incompatible with the two stalking charges Mangione still faces, while acknowledging that ordinary people might be ‌dumbfounded by the outcome.\n\nMangione, 27, still faces possible life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted on the stalking charges.\n\nDominic Gentile, a federal prosecutor, told Garnett at a routine court hearing on Friday the government has not decided whether it will appeal.\n\nThompson, who led UnitedHealth Group's health insurance business, was shot and killed on December 4, 2024 outside the Hilton hotel in midtown Manhattan.\n\nMangione pleaded not guilty to all ⁠charges stemming from Thompson's death, and has been ‌jailed since his arrest in Pennsylvania five days after the killing.\n\nWhile public officials widely condemned Thompson's killing, Mangione became a folk hero of sorts to many Americans who decry high costs for medical care ‍and health insurer practices.\n\nGarnett has scheduled jury selection in the case to begin in September, with the evidence phase of trial beginning October 12.\n\nMangione has also pleaded not guilty to separate murder, weapons and forgery charges in a New York state court in Manhattan.\n\nNo trial date in that case has been ​set. Prosecutors in that case suffered their own setback in September, when the judge dismissed two terrorism-related counts against Mangione.\n\nJUDGE ACKNOWLEDGES 'TORTURED AND ‌STRANGE' LEGAL ANALYSIS\n\nIn a 39-page decision, Garnett said federal prosecutors could pursue their murder and weapons charges only if the stalking charges qualified as \"crimes of violence.\"\n\nShe said the charges did not qualify because any use of force could be achieved through reckless, as opposed to intentional, conduct.\n\nThe judge said prosecutors and Mangione agreed that this fell short of the kind of \"force\" the Supreme Court required to make out a crime of violence.\n\nGarnett acknowledged the \"apparent absurdity\" of the legal landscape, saying no one would seriously question that Mangione's alleged conduct -- crossing state ⁠lines to kill a specific healthcare executive with a handgun equipped with ​a silencer -- was violent criminal conduct.\n\nShe said her analysis may strike ordinary people, ​and many lawyers and judges, as \"tortured and strange,\" but it \"represents the court's committed effort to faithfully apply the dictates of the Supreme Court to the charges in this case. The law must be the court's only concern.\"\n\nIn ‍a separate decision, Garnett rejected Mangione's ⁠bid to exclude evidence seized from his backpack when he was arrested.\n\nMangione argued that evidence found in the backpack, including a 9-millimeter pistol, silencer and journal entries, should be suppressed because police obtained it without a warrant.\n\nThe judge said it ⁠was standard practice for local police to search closed bags that might reasonably contain dangerous objects, and the police had probable cause to conduct a search. She ‌also said the contents would have been discovered inevitably through a federal search warrant.",

    "fullText": "EL PASO, Texas (KTSM) — El Paso District Court Judge Marlene Gonzalez is stepping back from cases involving migrant children, following allegations that she behaved impartially and prejudiced toward them in hearings.\n\n“As a judge, the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct prevents me from submitting to an interview or commenting on a case that I have recused myself from hearing. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to provide this response,” read a statement from Gonzalez who noted she voluntarily recused herself from hearings regarding unaccompanied migrant children’s cases.\n\nOn Dec. 17, 2025, attorneys from Estrella del Paso – an immigrant advocacy organization – filed a motion to recuse Gonzalez from hearings involving unaccompanied migrant children – children entering the U.S. illegally and without a parent or guardian.\n\nIn the court filing, attorneys and social services workers with the organization submitted written declarations detailing allegations that Gonzalez showed a “pattern and practice of cruelty” towards migrant children during the hearings.\n\nThe declarations made allegations that Gonzalez would subject children to humiliating interrogations about why they left their country, and that on multiple occasions she shamed the children for abandoning their parents.\n\nIn one account an attorney alleged that Gonzalez interrogated a 17-year-old Guatemalan boy who testified that he fled his country to Mexico from an abusive alcoholic father, but that he was kidnapped and beat up twice while in Mexico. The attorney alleged that in response, Gonzalez “harangued” the boy: “Why didn’t you stay in another part of Mexico? It’s beautiful, and it’s big. Why didn’t you stay in another part of Mexico?” the document read.\n\nIn another hearing involving a 16-year old Venezuelan girl from Venezuela who had been a victim of child prostitution, an attorney alleged that Gonzalez scolded the child “not to engage in prostitution.”\n\nThe filing went on to note that despite these alleged practices by Gonzalez, she would “unexpectedly” grant children their petitions seeking Special Immigrant Juvenile Visas, but that she recently began denying the petitions without providing any reasoning in 2025.\n\nEstrella del Paso declined an interview request with KTSM and instead offered the following statement:\n\n“For nearly 40 years, Estrella del Paso has provided legal representation and other legal services to immigrants in El Paso. We are a non-profit law firm. As attorneys, we take our legal and ethical duties to our clients very seriously, and we file every motion and document with the court with these duties in mind. The motion filed includes several detailed examples that our legal team took time and detailed care to compile. For accuracy and completeness, we encourage you to refer directly to that filing. We will not comment on the motions or our interactions with the court. All our clients are owed a duty of confidentiality, and we will not violate this duty, especially in the case of vulnerable children.”\n\nGonzalez’s current term runs through 2028.",

    "description": "Jeffrey Epstein's victims have accused Bank of America of facilitating Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking operation.",
    "fullText": "Sex trafficking victims of Jeffrey Epstein scored a mixed victory in court on Thursday after a federal judge tossed one of their lawsuits against a bank — but greenlit part of another case against a different bank.\n\nUS District Judge Jed Rakoff allowed portions of a proposed class-action lawsuit filed by victims against Bank of America to move forward, but dismissed other parts of the case.\n\nRakoff dismissed the entirety of a similar lawsuit the victims had filed against another bank, BNY.\n\nThe Epstein victims had accused Bank of America of ignoring red flags for Epstein's sex-trafficking operation. Their lawsuit said the bank facilitated millions of dollars — including over $170 million from former Apollo CEO Leon Black, who said he paid Epstein for tax advice — into Epstein's accounts. They said the funds were used in part to pay hush money to victims.\n\nRakoff dismissed the parts of the lawsuit that alleged the bank \"knowingly participated\" in Epstein's sex-trafficking operation, as well as allegations that it failed to follow know-your-customer laws in monitoring Epstein's accounts.\n\nBut the judge allowed the victims' claims that Bank of America was a \"knowing beneficiary\" of the sex-trafficking operation to move forward.\n\nThe judge tossed an entire lawsuit that the same lawyers filed against BNY, also known as Bank of New York Mellon Corp. The lawsuit had alleged BNY ignored red flags while processing Epstein's wire transfers and by extending credit to a modeling agency financed by Epstein and owned by Jean-Luc Brunel, who died in his prison cell in 2022 while awaiting trial in France for rape charges.\n\nDavid Boies, an attorney representing the Epstein victims, said he would appeal the dismissal of the BNY lawsuit.\n\n\"We are pleased that the Court sustained our sex trafficking claims against Bank of America, and we look forward to trying that case in May,\" Boies said in a statement. \"We respectively disagree with the Court's dismissal of the complaint against Bank of New York Mellon and we will seek appellate review.\"\n\nRakoff had expressed skepticism about the strength of both lawsuits during a December hearing in his lower Manhattan courtroom. He called them both \"a model of high-pitched rhetoric\" and compared them unfavorably to earlier lawsuits the same attorneys had brought on behalf of Epstein victims against JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, which settled for $290 million and $75 million, respectively.\n\nAt the end of the December hearing, Rakoff gave the lawyers two weeks to file amended versions of their lawsuits with more detail.\n\nThe revisions appeared not to satisfy Rakoff. He dismissed the counts \"with prejudice\" — meaning the lawyers won't get another chance to amend their lawsuits — and said he would issue an opinion explaining his reasoning by February 13.\n\n\"We are pleased with the court's decision dismissing the lawsuit in its entirety, which reinforces that BNY had no involvement in Epstein's crimes,\" BNY spokesperson Ryan Wells told Business Insider. \"BNY has great sympathy for the victims of Jeffrey Epstein and believes his crimes should be fully investigated and prosecuted.\"\n\nIn court, Bank of America lawyers said it offered nothing more than \"routine banking services\" for Epstein. Bill Haldin, a spokesperson for the bank, said it looked forward to \"a full review of the facts\" as the case moved forward.\n\n\"We are pleased the court dismissed most of the claims,\" Haldin said. \"On the remaining claims, it's important to understand the underlying facts have not been reviewed at this stage of the litigation.\"\n\nRakoff had previously put the lawsuits on a fast track, setting deadlines for summary judgment for the spring, which will give Bank of America another chance to have the case dismissed. A trial is scheduled for May.\n\nThe litigation is playing out in the same courthouse where victims have pressed judges to force the Department of Justice to publish its internal files related to Epstein, the well-connected pedophile who killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex-trafficking charges.\n\nThe Justice Department has blown past a December 19 deadline required by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed in November, to release all of its files. Victims and members of Congress have asked judges to appoint an independent monitor to oversee the release of the files. Judges have said they don't have the power to make such an appointment.\n\nIn a court filing Tuesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said the department had reviewed \"millions of pages of materials, applying redactions as appropriate\" and would publish them \"in the near term.\"",

    "description": "In a hearing, a judge advised YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson and Virtual Dining Concepts to settle their legal dispute over MrBeast Burger.",
    "fullText": "A judge urged MrBeast and his burger business partner to settle their legal battle to avoid airing \"dirty laundry\" — but paved the way for the case to go to trial.\n\nAt a hearing on Thursday, New York County Supreme Court Judge Jennifer Schecter appeared skeptical about the damages sustained by either side, both of which are suing the other. Despite that, she ruled that both cases could proceed.\n\nVDC said it looked \"forward to having our day in court.\" MrBeast's reps declined to comment.\n\nYouTube's top star, MrBeast (real name Jimmy Donaldson), launched MrBeast Burger, a largely delivery-only venture selling burgers and fried chicken sandwiches, with Virtual Dining Concepts in 2020. Donaldson hoped it would become the cornerstone of a food empire, but the partnership was plagued by tensions over undercooked orders and Donaldson's demands for more control of the business.\n\nIn July 2023, Donaldson's company sued VDC, portraying the YouTuber as a victim seeking to escape an unfair contract that had tarnished his reputation as a philanthropic, family-friendly entertainer. VDC fired back with its own lawsuit, saying Donaldson had walked away from a promising deal and failed to meet various contractual obligations, including appearances and promos.\n\nA big issue for the judge was the level of damages claimed by both sides. She said the evidence presented by MrBeast about bad Yelp reviews over MrBeast Burger orders seemed \"very compelling.\" But she said she was \"very skeptical\" that they \"would materially and irreparably harm the MrBeast brand under the circumstances.\"\n\nThe judge took special interest in MrBeast's argument that VDC owes him royalties over burger sales.\n\nVDC says MrBeast's camp instructed the company to reinvest his royalty share back into the business. MrBeast's side says it's entitled to royalties now that the partnership has fallen apart.\n\nThe judge urged the parties to think about seeking a business solution rather than a legal one, given the cost of fighting the case in court.\n\n\"If they can't take each other anymore, they should be thinking about a buyout, and it may be costly, but at the end of the day, maybe that's what these parties both should want,\" she said.\n\nThe judge also admitted some fascination with the case involving the world's biggest YouTuber and his ill-fated business venture.\n\nDuring the hour-and-a-half hearing, MrBeast's lawyer, Steven Marenberg, alleged that the burger complaints harmed the YouTuber's reputation.\n\nHe said the \"systemic, deep\" dissatisfaction with MrBeast Burger could \"impact, irreparably,\" the YouTuber's brand.\n\nShawn Rabin, VDC's lawyer, countered by claiming that MrBeast wanted to lower the value of the business so he could \"buy it on the cheap\" and take control of it.",

    "fullText": "A federal appeals court ruled late Wednesday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it ended legal protections that gave hundreds of thousands of people from Venezuela permission to live and work in the United States.\n\nA three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that found Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem exceeded her authority when she ended temporary protected status for Venezuelans.\n\nThe decision, however, will not have any immediate practical effect after the U.S. Supreme Court in October allowed Noem's decision to take effect pending a final decision by the justices.\n\nAn email late Wednesday night to the Department of Homeland Security was not immediately returned.\n\nThe 9th Circuit panel also upheld the lower court's finding that Noem exceeded her authority when she decided to end TPS early for hundreds of thousands of people from Haiti.\n\nA federal judge in Washington is expected to rule any day now on a request to pause the termination of TPS for Haiti while a separate lawsuit challenging it proceeds. The country’s TPS designation is scheduled to end on February 3.\n\nNinth Circuit Judges Kim Wardlaw, Salvador Mendoza, Jr. and Anthony Johnstone said in Wednesday's ruling that the TPS legislation passed by Congress did not give the secretary the power to vacate an existing TPS designation. All three judges were nominated by Democratic presidents.\n\n“The statute contains numerous procedural safeguards that ensure individuals with TPS enjoy predictability and stability during periods of extraordinary and temporary conditions in their home country,” Wardlaw, who was nominated by President Bill Clinton, wrote for the panel.\n\nWardlaw said Noem's “unlawful actions have had real and significant consequences” for Venezuelans and Haitians in the United States who rely on TPS.\n\n“The record is replete with examples of hard-working, contributing members of society — who are mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, and partners of U.S. citizens, pay taxes, and have no criminal records — who have been deported or detained after losing their TPS,” she wrote.\n\nTemporary Protected Status, or TPS, authorized by Congress as part of the Immigration Act of 1990, allows the Homeland Security secretary to grant legal immigration status to people fleeing countries experiencing civil strife, environmental disaster or other “extraordinary and temporary conditions” that prevent a safe return to that home country.\n\nDesignations are granted for terms of six, 12 or 18 months, and extensions can be granted so long as conditions remain dire. The status prevents holders from being deported and allows them to work, but it does not give them a path to citizenship.\n\nIn ending the protections, Noem said that conditions in both Haiti and Venezuela had improved and that it was not in the national interest to allow immigrants from the two countries to stay on for what is a temporary program.\n\nMillions of Venezuelans have fled political unrest, mass unemployment and hunger. The country is mired in a prolonged crisis brought on by years of hyperinflation, political corruption, economic mismanagement and an ineffectual government.\n\nHaiti was first designated for TPS in 2010 after a catastrophic magnitude 7.0 earthquake killed and wounded hundreds of thousands of people, and left more than 1 million homeless. Haitians face widespread hunger and gang violence.\n\nMendoza wrote separately that there was “ample evidence of racial and national origin animus” that reinforced the lower court's conclusion that Noem's decisions were “preordained and her reasoning pretextual.”\n\n“It is clear that the Secretary’s vacatur actions were not actually grounded in substantive policy considerations or genuine differences with respect to the prior administration’s TPS procedures, but were instead rooted in a stereotype-based diagnosis of immigrants from Venezuela and Haiti as dangerous criminals or mentally unwell,” he wrote.\n\nAttorneys for the government have argued the secretary has clear and broad authority to make determinations related to the TPS program and those decisions are not subject to judicial review. They have also denied that her actions were motived by racial animus.",

    "description": "Michael Harris II, Sal Stewart and Luis Robert Jr. are on the rise in our 5x5 player rankings for 2026.",
    "fullText": "Moving on from the “way too early” rankings, this is the first official edition of the top 300 for 2026. Players are ranked for 5x5 mixed leagues using a one-catcher format. I include the mixed-league disclaimer because I do reward upside, particularly past the top 200 or so.\n\n⚾️ Coming soon: MLB returns to NBC and Peacock in 2026! In addition to becoming the exclusive home of Sunday Night Baseball, NBC Sports will broadcast MLB Sunday Leadoff, “Opening Day” and Labor Day primetime games, the first round of the MLB Draft, the entire Wild Card round of the postseason, and much more.\n\n- Falling off: Grant Taylor (234th), Christian Moore (289th), Troy Johnston (296th)\n\n- Just a little update here, and it's mostly because I wanted to make my new feelings known about MacKenzie Gore after last week's trade. Gore was my No. 85 SP before getting sent to the Rangers, leaving him about 10 spots off the original top 300, but that was largely because I have the Nationals as the second worst situation for pitchers in the league. Dealing with poor defense and especially poor catching, Nationals pitchers have had ERA far in excess of their FIPs the last two years (4.72 FIP, 5.35 ERA season), and their bullpen figures to be especially poor this year.\n\nI'm not quite as sure what to make about the situation in Texas, largely because Globe Life Field has been all over the map; it had one of the best park factors for hitters in 2023, only to play as a significant pitchers' park in 2024 and an extreme one in 2025. It's been especially tough on right-handed power the last two years. Maybe that won't keep up, but if it does, it's especially great for a left-handed flyball pitcher like Gore. As a result, I have Gore all of the way up to 35th among SPs now, and he checks in at No. 135 overall here.\n\n- The other significant change is Seranthony Domínguez going from 26th to 21st among RPs after signing on to close for the White Sox. Grant Taylor fell from 23rd to 28th, leaving him just off the list. I wasn't projecting him for many saves in the first place, but this does take away some of his upside. I still think he'll be fantastic in a multi-inning setup role.\n\n- Moore and Johnston lost some playing time in my projections with the Angels re-signing Yoán Moncada and the Rockies acquiring Edouard Julien. Julien could play second for Colorado, but he's a liability there. I have him slightly outhitting Johnston, though his limited home run and steal potential keeps him off the list.\n\n- Harrison Bader didn't make the top 300 while he was still a free agent, and though he'll obviously be a regular in San Francisco, he's further away now after joining the Giants.\n\n- Having Michael Harris II ranked 30th overall isn’t something I saw coming when I started doing my projections. I’ve been just as disappointed by his lack of progress as everyone else; his OPS has gone from .853 in his rookie season to .808, .722 and .678 the last three years. And yet I found so much more to be encouraged about than I thought I would, enough to think that he’s quite a bit more likely to duplicate his second half of 2025 (.299/.315/.430, 14 HR) than his first half (.210/.234/.317). He scores this highly for me even though, because I have him batting seventh, he’s projected for the second fewest plate appearances of anyone in my top 50 hitters (only Jazz Chisholm Jr. has fewer). If he gets off to a nice start and finds himself moving up the Braves lineup, I think the potential is there for him to be the steal of the year.\n\n- Sal Stewart’s placement here at No. 57 is another one that’ll raise eyebrows. I’m actually rather disappointed the Reds traded Gavin Lux, since that should help Stewart’s ADP some. Really, though, I wasn’t worried about Lux or anyone else being in Stewart’s way, no matter how hesitant Terry Francona was to use him last September. Stewart just hammers the baseball in a way that separates him from everyone else on the Reds roster, save Elly De La Cruz. He’ll bat lower in the order initially, but he could quickly settle into the cleanup spot. There’s no reason he can’t make a run at 100 RBI, and his value would only increase if the Reds get him some extra position eligibility by playing him at third or second.\n\n- Luis Robert Jr. moved up about 15 spots to No. 74 with Tuesday's trade to the Mets. Citi Field is a little bit of an upgrade for him in the ballpark department, and he's certainly in a better lineup now, even if the trade means he's more likely to spend most of the year batting in the bottom half of the order. On the plus side, that will free him up to continue stealing bases.\n\n- Neither the Robert addition nor the Bo Bichette signing did anything for one of my favorite picks this year, Brett Baty. Still, I'm keeping the faith. Baty is athletic enough to handle left field, and even if Carson Benge emerges there, I'd still take Baty over Mark Vientos as a DH against right-handers. Baty showed 25-homer power last season, and his contract rates are a little better than his strikeout percentages suggest. If he can get the ball into the air with a little more frequency this year, he should bust out.\n\n- On the White Sox side of things, Lenyn Sosa (No. 219) and Brooks Baldwin (no. 268) both moved up with Robert out of the mix. Luisangel Acuña seems poised for a shot to replace Robert in center, but while he could steal 40 bags as an everyday guy, I think his bat will probably force him into a utility role. Sosa isn't necessarily a good regular for a major league team, either, given his middling defense and atrocious walk rate, but he hit 22 homers last season and managed a solid .264 average in the process. He ought to be the White Sox's primary DH. Baldwin seems like an unexciting, jack-of-all-trades sort, but his EV numbers took a nice jump last year and he's gone 9-for-9 stealing bases in 136 big-league games. He could be a sneaky 15 HR/15 SB guy if he's in the lineup most of the time.\n\n- I was already lower than most on Freddy Peralta for this season, and the trade to the Mets didn't help, dropping him from 27th to 35th among starting pitchers. Still, it would have been considerably worse if the Mets hadn't upgraded their defense this winter. The Brewers are just so strong there and, aided by their ballpark, make their hurlers appear better than they actually are; their pitchers have a league-low .274 BABIP over the last three years, with Peralta himself coming in at .265.\n\n- There are still only 27 relievers in the top 300, though that number will swell as closing situations start to clear up a little this spring. The unrepresented teams are the Athletics, Diamondbacks, Nationals, Rangers, Rockies and Twins, while the Brewers and Astros each have two relievers on the list. Also present is free agent Serathony Domínguez, who I suspect will wind up closing for one of those unrepresented teams (or maybe the White Sox). The relievers on those clubs closest to making the list were Arizona's Kevin Ginkel (34th among RPs), the Athletics' Mark Leiter Jr. (37th), the Twins' Cole Sands (42nd) and the Rockies' Victor Vodnik (47th).",

    "fullText": "Members of a motorcycle club and a street gang clearly targeted an Indiana judge for assassination, police said Tuesday, days after officers arrested five people in connection with the attack.\n\nPolice and prosecutors at a news conference praised what they characterized as a relentless effort to track down who opened fire on Tippecanoe County Superior Court Judge Steven Meyer and his wife, Kim, at their home in Lafayette on Jan. 18. Both Meyer and his wife suffered gunshot wounds but survived.\n\nThe Lafayette Police Department, the FBI, the Indiana State Police and the Purdue University Police Department launched a search for the shooter that went on for days before apprehending five people in synchronized arrests Thursday evening, including four in Indiana and one in Lexington, Kentucky. Court appearances for the suspects were set for Wednesday in Indiana and Kentucky.\n\n“This attack was more than an assault on two citizens,” LaFayette Police Chief Scott Galloway said. “This was an assault on the rule of law itself.”\n\nProsecutors allege that the attack was designed to derail a domestic abuse case against Thomas Moss, a member of the Detroit-based Phantom MC motorcycle club with ties to the Vice Lords street gang.\n\nAccording to a probable cause affidavit, the Vice Lords offered the victim in the case $10,000 not to testify against Moss but she refused.\n\nWith Moss' trial set to begin on Jan. 20 in front of Meyer, another Phantom MC member, Blake Smith, purchased a shotgun. A masked man traveled to the Meyers' home armed with that shotgun on Jan. 18. He lured the couple to the door by saying he was looking for his dog, shot them through the door and fled.\n\n“(Meyer) was targeted,” Indiana State Police Lt. Col. Al Williamson said at Tuesday's news conference. “They went after him for a reason.”\n\nPolice recovered the mask, the shooter's clothing and the shotgun discarded near the Meyers' home. DNA on the mask matched Raylen Ferguson, an associate of the Almighty Vice Lord Nation from Lexington, Kentucky, according to the affidavit.\n\nSurveillance video showed a car that was parked near the Meyers' home had traveled from Kentucky toward Lafayette on Jan. 16 and traveled toward Smith's residence in the hour after the shootings, according to the affidavit.\n\nMoss, Ferguson and Smith each face multiple charges, including attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Amanda Milsap, whom prosecutors allege offered the bribe in the domestic abuse case, faces bribery and obstruction counts. Zeneda Greer, a woman Ferguson lives with, has been charged with helping a criminal and obstruction. Prosecutors have accused her of traveling to Lafayette with Ferguson.\n\nMilsap's attorney, Earl McCoy, didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Online court records did not list attorneys for Moss, Ferguson or Blake. Jail records indicate Greer is being held in Lexington. Online court records in that state did not list an attorney for her.",

    "fullText": "Patrick Schiltz, Minnesota’s chief federal judge, on Monday ordered Todd Lyons, the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to appear personally before the court Friday, acknowledging that the order marked an “extraordinary step.”\n\nThe order stems from the case of a man who has been in immigration detention since he was arrested earlier this month. Schiltz noted that on Jan. 14 the court told the Trump administration to provide the man with a bond hearing within seven days, noting that if they didn’t meet that deadline, the man would have to be immediately released. The judge said the administration did neither of those things and the man remains in custody as of Monday evening.\n\nPolitics: Fox News Host Grills Kristi Noem With Devastating Question On Alex Pretti Shooting\n\n“This is one of dozens of court orders with which respondents have failed to\ncomply in recent weeks,” Schiltz wrote in his brief order.\n\nThe judge noted that the court has been “extremely patient” with the administration, even though it launched its immigration enforcement operation in the state without making any provisions for the hundreds of lawsuits that would inevitably arise as a result.\n\nSchiltz, an appointee of former Republican President George W. Bush, went on to condemn the administration for failing to follow through on its pledges to obey judicial orders and take the steps required to do so.\n\n“The Court’s patience is at an end,” he warned. “Accordingly, the Court will order Todd Lyons, the Acting Director of ICE, to appear personally before the Court and show cause why he should not be held in contempt of Court.”\n\nPolitics: Harry Enten Names The Trump Official Who Is A 'Political Disaster' Right Now\n\n“The Court acknowledges that ordering the head of a federal agency to personally appear is an extraordinary step, but the extent of ICE’s violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have been tried and failed,” he added.\n\nLike this article? Keep independent journalism alive. Support HuffPost.\n\nHowever, Schiltz made clear that if the court gets notified that the man has been released from custody, Lyons will no longer be required to appear in court and the Friday hearing will be canceled.\n\nThis is not the first time Schiltz has chastised the administration. Last week, Schiltz ripped the Justice Department over the approach it took to bring charges against former CNN anchor Don Lemon and four others in connection with an anti-ICE protest in St. Paul.\n\nSchiltz declined to reverse a lower court’s ruling rejecting DOJ’s demand, but the department chose to further escalate the matter, urging the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals to order Schiltz to act.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is headed to Iowa on Tuesday as part of the White House’s midterm-year pivot toward affordability, even as his administration remains mired in fallout over a second fatal shooting by federal immigration officers in in Minneapolis.\n\nIn a display of reducing tensions, Trump said he had “great calls” with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Jacob Frey on Monday, after federal immigration officers killed a protester for the second time in two weeks. Trump’s sudden shift toward a more conciliatory approach is just the latest in a string of moments where he's taken maximalist positions, only to appear to retreat.\n\nThe Trump White House has tried to blame Democratic leaders for the protests. But after videos suggest his administration wrongly labeled ICU nurse Alex Pretti an active threat to the ICE agents who shot him, the administration is trying to recalibrate its crackdown, putting White House border czar Tom Homan in charge of its Minnesota immigration operations among other moves and announcing that Greg Bovino was leaving the city.\n\nThe chief federal judge in Minnesota, meanwhile, ordered Todd Lyons, the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to appear before him Friday to explain why he shouldn’t be held in contempt for Trump administration failures to hold hearings for detained immigrants.\n\nTrump disputes staff and says slain Alex Pretti was not an ‘assassin’\n\nTrump was asked if the killed Minneapolis protester was an “assassin” as a key aide has claimed and the president answered “no.”\n\nThe president added, however, that protesters “can’t have guns” as Pretti did and “it’s just a very unfortunate incident.” Trump has said he wants the death investigated.\n\nOn Saturday, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller on social media described Pretti as an “assassin” who “tried to murder federal agents.” Vice President JD Vance shared the post on X as well.\n\nTrump says he’s going to be ‘watching over’ investigation into Pretti’s killing, which he calls ‘very sad’\n\nThe president was asked as he left the White House on Tuesday whether he thought Pretti’s killing was justified and he responded by saying that a “big investigation” was underway.\n\n“I want to see the investigation. I’m going to be watching over it, and I want a very honorable and honest investigation. I have to see it myself,” he said.\n\nHe was also asked about Pretti’s family and said in response, he said: “I love everybody. I love all of our people. I love his family. And it’s a very sad situation.”\n\nTrump says Noem isn’t going to resign\n\nAsked by reporters as he left the White House on Tuesday for a trip to Iowa whether Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is going to step down, Trump had a one-word answer: “No.”\n\nDemocrats in Congress have called for Noem’s exit after federal agents fatally shot two people in Minneapolis protesting immigration enforcement actions.\n\nTrump sent his border czar Tom Homan to Minneapolis and said on Tuesday that Homan was meeting with both the mayor and Minnesota governor.\n\nMinnesota resident says ‘world-changing events’ so close to home have been ‘overwhelming’\n\nChristina Leeson, who lives in the Minneapolis suburb Edina and was at Pretti’s vigil Tuesday morning, said Bovino’s leave is encouraging, though she’s hesitant to believe things are over since Tom Homan is coming in.\n\n“It’s just overwhelming, the amount of world-changing events that have happened within a 3-mile radius,” she said, referring to the death of Renee Good earlier in January, and George Floyd in 2020.\n\n“I feel like this is usually the time of year where I think we all kind of question why we live in Minnesota when it’s, you now, negative zero or below zero for weeks on end,” she said.\n\nLeeson said the way the community has come together in recent weeks has been a reminder of “the community, and how much we care for our neighbors and look out for each other, and are going to come out, and stand for what we believe is right no matter what.”\n\nWalz has made his priorities clear to Homan, governor’s office says\n\n“Governor Walz met with Tom Homan this morning and reiterated Minnesota’s priorities: impartial investigations into the Minneapolis shootings involving federal agents, a swift, significant reduction in the number of federal forces in Minnesota, and an end to the campaign of retribution against Minnesota,” the governor’s office announced.\n\n“The Governor and Homan agreed on the need for an ongoing dialogue and will continue working toward those goals, which the President also agreed to yesterday. The Governor tasked the Minnesota Department of Public Safety as the primary liaison to Homan to ensure these goals are met,” the statement said.\n\nImmigration agents still active across the Twin Cities\n\nIf they’ve changed tactics with the shift in tone from the White House, it wasn’t immediately clear in the Minneapolis and St. Paul area.\n\nThe streets appeared largely quiet Tuesday morning in South Minneapolis neighborhoods where unmarked convoys of immigration agents have been regular sights in recent weeks, including the neighborhoods where two people were killed by federal agents.\n\nBut Associated Press staff saw carloads of agents in northeast Minneapolis and in the suburb of Little Canada.\n\nEvery living former Democratic president has now addressed Pretti’s killing\n\nFormer President Joe Biden said on social media on Tuesday that the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis “betrays our most basic values as Americans.”\n\nFormer President Barack Obama said Sunday that the killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti by a U.S. Border Patrol officer should be a “wake-up call to every American” and warned that “our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault.”\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton’s statement Sunday said that “over the course of a lifetime, we face only a few moments where the decisions we make and the actions we take will shape our history for years to come.”\n\n“This is one of them,” Clinton said. “If we give our freedoms away after 250 years, we might never get them back.”\n\nCivil rights leaders to meet with Minnesota attorney general\n\nNAACP president Derrick Johnson and League of United Latin American Citizens president Roman Palomares will hold community events in Minneapolis on Tuesday before meeting with Ellison.\n\nThe events include a visit to the site where Alex Pretti was shot and killed by federal immigration officers for a “moment of reflection,” according to a press release from LULAC, and a “Community Conversation” held at NAACP’s Minneapolis headquarters.\n\nTrump immigration crackdown contributes to drop in US population growth rate\n\nTrump’s crackdown on immigration contributed to a year-to-year drop in the nation’s growth rate as the U.S. population reached nearly 342 million people in 2025, according to population estimates released Tuesday by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe 0.5% growth rate was a sharp drop from 2024’s immigration-fueled rate of almost 1%, which grew the population to an estimated 340 million.\n\nBirths outnumbered deaths last year by 519,000 people last year and 1.3 million people immigrated, compared with 2.8 million immigrants in 2024.\n\nIn the past 125 years, the lowest growth rate was during the coronavirus pandemic, when the population grew by just 0.16% in 2021. Before that, the lowest rate was just under 0.5% in 1919 during the Spanish flu.\n\n▶ Read more about how Trump policies are affecting U.S. population numbers\n\nMinnesota attorney general wants more than talk from Trump administration\n\nKeith Ellison said he hopes Trump’s “Operation Metro Surge” will end immediately. Asked on MS NOW’s “Morning Joe” Tuesday if Trump’s newly conciliatory posture has led to more federal cooperation with state and local officials in Minneapolis, Ellison said “not that I’ve seen so far.”\n\n“You should understand, Minnesota is abiding by the law as written. We, under the 10th Amendment, the federal government doesn’t have the authority to convert us into its deputies,” Ellison said. “And what the federal government has done is said, ‘well, if you don’t do it our way, we’re going to saturate your state with 4,000 ICE agents until you cry uncle and obey.’ And that’s unconstitutional and illegal.”\n\n“It’s a good thing” Trump talked with Minnesota’s governor and Minneapolis’ mayor, Ellison said. “But we need to see some results ... they’ve got to show, not just say.”\n\nBrandi Carlile donating to defense of Minnesota ICE detainees\n\nDescribing herself as “heartbroken and angry for Minnesota,” the singer-songwriter says her foundation will grant $25,000 to a Minnesota organization that provides legal defense to people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n“Over the past month, the community there has continued to set an incredible example for the rest of us, demonstrating the power of uniting to protect our neighbors and defend what is right,” she posted on Instagram Monday. “Now, more than ever, it is vital that we continue to hold each other and take action to stop the hate that is spreading through our country.”\n\nCarlile said the Looking Out Foundation is granting the money to help The Advocates for Human Rights provide free legal assistance to detainees.\n\nFetterman calls on Trump to fire Noem\n\nPennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman is calling on Trump to fire Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem after federal agents fatally shot two protesters in Minneapolis.\n\n“Americans have died,” Fetterman said in a direct appeal to Trump. “She is betraying DHS’s core mission and trashing your border security legacy.”\n\nFetterman, a Democrat who has increasingly voted with Republicans, said Trump should “NOT make the mistake President Biden made for not firing a grossly incompetent DHS Secretary.”\n\nFetterman voted with Democrats in April 2024 to dismiss a trial against Biden’s Homeland Security Secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, after he was impeached by the Republican-led House.\n\nWhat to know about Gregory Bovino\n\nThe field commander of Trump’s immigration crackdown in Minneapolis is leaving the city after federal agents fatally shot two people.\n\nBovino had been the go-to architect for the large-scale immigration crackdowns ordered by Trump and the public face of his administration’s city-by-city sweeps. The Border Patrol chief led agents in Los Angeles, Chicago and New Orleans before he headed to Minnesota in December for what the Department of Homeland Security called its largest-ever immigration enforcement operation.\n\n“We’re going to turn and burn to that next target and the next and the next and the next, and we’re not going to stop,” Bovino said in an interview.\n\n▶ Read more about Bovino’s career, methods and approach\n\nMelania Trump, on morning show, calls for unity\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump said in a Fox News interview Tuesday that Americans needed to come together as protests continue in Minneapolis.\n\n“I’m against the violence. So, if — please, if you protest, protest in peace. And we need to unify in these times,” she said.\n\nMelania Trump’s comments went beyond her husband’s in calling for calm, though he has softened his rhetoric in recent days while continuing to blame Democrats for the violence.\n\nShe also echoed the president’s previous statements that he had a “great call” Monday with Walz and Frey, adding they were working together to ensure protests were “without riots.”\n\nThe interview with Ainsley Earnhardt on “Fox & Friends” was pegged to the upcoming release of a new documentary about the first lady.\n\nThis item has been corrected. Melania Trump said “if you protest,” not “if we protest.”\n\nTrump says his calls with Minnesota Democratic leaders were ‘great’\n\nIn a display of reducing tensions, Trump said in a radio interview broadcast Tuesday that he had “great calls” with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Jacob Frey on Monday, after federal immigration officers killed a protester for the second time in two weeks.\n\nThe Trump White House has tried to blame Democratic leaders for the protests. But after videos suggest his administration wrongly labeled Alex Pretti an active threat to ICE agents, the administration is trying to recalibrate its crackdown, putting White House border czar Tom Homan in charge of its Minnesota immigration operations among other moves.\n\n“Actually, they were both great conversations,” the president said on the show “Sid & Friends In The Morning” on 77 WABC in New York City. “So let’s hope that turns out to be so.”\n\nICE chief must appear in court to explain why detainees have been denied due process\n\nThe chief federal judge in Minnesota says the Trump administration has failed to comply with orders to hold hearings for detained immigrants. He’s ordered Todd Lyons, Trump’s acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to appear before him Friday to explain why he shouldn’t be held in contempt.\n\n“This Court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result,” Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz wrote in the order dated Monday.\n\nMessages were sent Tuesday to ICE and a DHS spokesperson seeking a response.\n\nICE agents will have a security role at Milan Cortina Olympics\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents will have a security role during the upcoming Milan Cortina Winter Games, according to information shared with local media by sources at the U.S. Embassy in Rome. The Associated Press independently confirmed the information with two sources at the embassy.\n\nThe sources who confirmed ICE participation on Tuesday said that federal ICE agents would support diplomatic security details and would not run any immigration enforcement operations.\n\nDuring previous Olympics, several federal agencies have supported security for U.S. diplomats, including the investigative component of ICE called Homeland Security Investigations, the sources said. They could not be named because they are not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nMilan Mayor Giuseppe Sala said that ICE would not be welcome in his city, which is hosting most ice sports during the Feb. 6-22 Winter Games.\n\n▶ Read more about the ICE agents' planned role in Milan\n\n—- By Trisha Thomas and David Biller\n\nBovino is set to leave Minneapolis as Trump reshuffles the leadership of his immigration crackdown\n\nBorder Patrol commander Gregory Bovino is expected to leave Minneapolis on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the matter, as the Trump administration reshuffles leadership of its immigration enforcement operation and scales back the federal presence after a second fatal shooting by federal officers.\n\nTrump said he was placing his border czar, Tom Homan, in charge of the mission, with Homan reporting directly to the White House, after Bovino drew condemnation for claiming the man who was killed, Alex Pretti, had been planning to “massacre” law enforcement officers, a characterization that authorities had not substantiated.\n\nBovino’s leadership of highly visible federal crackdowns, including operations that sparked mass demonstrations in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and Minneapolis, has drawn fierce criticism from local officials, civil rights advocates and congressional Democrats.\n\nA person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press that Bovino is among the federal agents leaving Minneapolis. The person was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the operation and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.\n\n▶ Read more about Trump's ICE enforcement leadership reshuffle\n\nTrump administration’s trust and credibility tested in wake of Pretti’s death in Minneapolis\n\nTrust is one of a president’s most valuable currencies, especially in a time of crisis. During his second term, Trump has persistently undermined the trust and credibility of major universities, national law firms and media and taken punitive actions against them. His supporters largely either endorsed those actions or stayed mum.\n\nNow the credibility question is aimed at his administration. While the criticism is not directly aimed at the president by his supporters, it is a sign that trust is eroding over some of his most important policies.\n\nThe White House seemed to try to ease the conflict Monday. Trump and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz spoke and both suggested their conversation was productive. Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino, who has been at the center of the administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement surge nationwide, is expected to soon leave Minneapolis.\n\nStill, lawmakers from both parties — including many Republicans — called for independent investigations and, perhaps most importantly, trust after administration officials gave one account of the shooting in Minneapolis, while contemporaneous video provided a decidedly different one.\n\n▶ Read more about how Trump's credibility is increasingly being questioned\n\nTrump will visit Iowa in a bid to focus on affordability during fallout from Minneapolis shooting\n\nTrump is headed to Iowa on Tuesday as part of the White House’s midterm-year pivot toward affordability while his administration remains mired in the fallout in Minneapolis over a second fatal shooting by federal immigration officers this month. Even as some top administration officials moved quickly to malign Alex Pretti, the White House said Monday that Trump was waiting until an investigation into the shooting was complete.\n\nWhile in Iowa, the Republican president will make a stop at a local business and then deliver a speech on affordability, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. The remarks will be at the Horizon Events Center in Clive, a suburb of Des Moines.\n\nThe trip will also highlight energy policy, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said last week. It’s part of the White House’s strategy to have Trump travel out of Washington once a week ahead of the midterm elections to focus on affordability issues facing everyday Americans — an effort that keeps getting diverted by crisis.\n\nMinnesota killing produces backlash against Trump administration from Second Amendment advocates\n\nProminent Republicans and gun rights advocates helped elicit a White House turnabout this week after bristling over the administration’s characterization of Alex Prettibas responsible for his own death because he lawfully possessed a weapon.\n\nThe death produced no clear shifts in U.S. gun politics or policies, even Trump shuffles the lieutenants in charge of his militarized immigration crackdown. But important voices in Trump’s coalition have called for a thorough investigation of Pretti’s death while also criticizing inconsistencies in some Republicans’ Second Amendment stances.\n\nIf the dynamic persists, it could give Republicans problems as Trump heads into a midterm election year with voters already growing skeptical of his overall immigration approach. The concern is acute enough that Trump’s top spokeswoman sought Monday to reassert his brand as a staunch gun rights supporter.\n\n“The president supports the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding American citizens, absolutely,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.\n\nLeavitt qualified that “when you are bearing arms and confronted by law enforcement, you are raising … the risk of force being used against you.”\n\n▶ Read more about the backlash among gun rights advocates",

    "fullText": "Jan 26 (Reuters) - Attorneys for Meta Platforms and other social media companies asked a California federal judge on Monday to block several school districts from taking their lawsuits against the companies to trial, arguing that federal law protects them from claims they ​knowingly addicted young users.\n\nAt a hearing before U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, lawyers for the companies clashed with counsel ‌for six school districts from states across the country, who argue the platforms' design has harmed students' mental health and forced districts to spend money and staff time to address the fallout.\n\nThe companies urged ‌the judge to rule that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which generally shields platforms like Meta's Facebook and Instagram from liability over user-generated content, bars the cases from proceeding to the first trials in federal court over the claims.\n\nJonathan Blavin, an attorney for the social media companies, said the schools’ allegations rely on evidence that includes such content, placing the claims within the protections of Section 230.\n\n\"If that evidence is entirely excluded, I think the record here is incredibly thin,\" Blavin said. \"It's just ⁠not there.\"\n\nLawyers for the school districts countered that their ‌claims are not based on user-content but on platform features they say are intentionally designed to keep young people on the social media sites as long as possible.\n\nAndre Mura, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said their experts had examined broad studies of ‍students who had used social media to support their findings that it had harmed them.\n\n“The literature shows the increase in the risk of harm is not based on content,” he said.\n\nTHOUSANDS OF LAWSUITS IN STATE, FEDERAL COURT\n\nMeta, Snapchat and parent Snap Inc., YouTube and parent Alphabet Inc., and TikTok and parent ByteDance are facing thousands of lawsuits in both federal and ​state court over claims they knowingly designed their platforms to have features that addict children and teens, fueling a mental health crisis.\n\nThe first trial testing ‌the claims in state court is slated for this week in Los Angeles.\n\nThe federal cases have been consolidated into multidistrict litigation before Rogers and include lawsuits brought by families, school districts and state governments.\n\nMonday's hearing focused only on cases filed by school districts, which claim they have been hurt financially from having to manage student mental health issues and social problems like cyberbullying. Rogers is considering whether to enter judgment for the companies in six of those lawsuits, selected as so-called \"bellwether\" or test cases, ahead of the first trials in federal court, currently scheduled to begin in June.\n\nBellwether trials are used to gauge how juries may respond to similar ⁠claims and help establish settlement values for the other similar cases in the litigation.\n\nIn rulings ​on the companies’ motions to dismiss in 2023 and 2024, Rogers said the cases could go ​forward, but Section 230 limited many of their claims, including some about specific features of the platforms.\n\nOn Monday, Rogers agreed that the plaintiffs had a lot of evidence that seemed to be based on content and said that should the cases go forward, there ‍would be a lengthy debate about what ⁠could be shown to the juries.\n\nBut even if the actual content played some role, Rogers said that juries were often asked to examine a problem with several causes and determine which were primarily to blame.\n\n“It’s not like we have a white and a yolk, it’s all scrambled together,” Rogers ⁠said. “That’s a very common circumstance. Why should this be any different?”\n\nThe case is In Re: Social Media Adolescent Addiction/Personal Injury Products Liability Litigation, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District ‌of California, No. 4:22-md-03047.\n\nFor plaintiffs: Andre Mura of Gibbs Mura; Previn Warren of Motley Rice\n\nFor defendants: Jonathan Blavin of Munger Tolles & Olson; ‌Ashley Hardin of Williams & Connolly; Christian Pistilli of Covington & Burling",

    "description": "The president raised a fuss about his ballroom project as a federal judge considers an injunction.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Sunday railed against legal efforts to stop the construction of a massive ballroom on the grounds of the White House.\n\n“There is no practical or reasonable way to go back,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “IT IS TOO LATE!”\n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation last month sued to block the construction of the ballroom after Trump last year demolished the East Wing with little notice to make room for the new building, which will dwarf the main residence.\n\n“The so-called ‘preservationists,’ who get their money from the most unusual of places, should not be allowed to stop this desperately needed addition to our GREAT White House, a place that a President has never needed permission to change or enhance, because of the special grounds on which it sits, no matter how big (and important!), that enhancement may be.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Richard Leon last week questioned the administration’s legal authority on the project and seemed skeptical as he considers a potential injunction. The judge said he would decide next month.\n\nTrump has said the up to $400 million cost of the ballroom will be funded by private donations, raising ethical and other questions that the White House has yet to answer.\n\nBut on Sunday, he defended the planned facility as “a great, big, beautiful gift to the United States of America” and complained that the East Wing had been “bastardized” by previous renovations.\n\nTrump also said that the lawsuit has caused “top secret” information about the project to emerge.\n\nPolitics: U.S. Senator Comes Out And Says It About Trump: 'Invoke The 25th Amendment'\n\n“Additionally, in this instance, it is being done with the design, consent, and approval of the highest levels of the United States Military and Secret Service. The mere bringing of this ridiculous lawsuit has already, unfortunately, exposed this heretofore Top Secret fact. Stoppage of construction, at this late date, when so much has already been ordered and done, would be devastating to the White House, our Country, and all concerned.”\n\nWhile he did not get more specific, the East Wing was known to house the Presidential Emergency Operations Center ― aka the “underground bunker,” which Trump reportedly used during protests in 2020 ― and the new project is likely to replace and/or upgrade the facility.\n\nTrump has been obsessed with the project, which he frequently brings up unprompted. Earlier this month, he even interrupted a White House meeting with oil industry executives to get up, wander over to a window, and stare at the construction site.\n\nTrump on Sunday fired off messages on Truth Social about a number of topics including complaints about the NFL, Canada and journalist Don Lemon. He also wrote some messages about the ongoing unrest in Minneapolis, which has only grown more tense after federal agents shot and killed 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti.\n\nPolitics: National Trust Warns Trump's Ballroom Will 'Overwhelm' White House\n\nBut it was his message about the ballroom that he pinned to the top of his feed.\n\nThe Architect Doing Trump's Ballroom Also Thinks It's Way Too Big: Report\n\n'I Can't Watch': Trump Fires Off Unexpected Whine At The Worst Possible Time\n\nHere's Who Has Been Surprisingly Willing To Defy Trump In His Second Term",

Ted Cruz traveled to Cancun in 2021 as a winter storm caused extended outages across the state.\n\nCruz was seen this week leaving Texas as reports of the winter storm's intensity grew.\n\nCruz returned to Texas Friday.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A report by former special counsel Jack Smith on his investigation into President Donald Trump's hoarding of classified documents belongs in the “dustbin of history\" and should remain sealed, the Justice Department said in a sharply worded court filing Friday.\n\n“The illicit product of an unlawful investigation and prosecution belongs in the dustbin of history. The United States will leave it there,” prosecutors wrote.\n\nThe department's position echoes that of Trump, whose lawyers this week asked U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon to permanently block the release of the Smith report. It adds to the likelihood that a detailed report on a criminal investigation once seen as posing significant legal peril to Trump might continue to remain hidden from public view.\n\nSmith and his team produced a two-volume report on investigations into Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Biden and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, after he left the White House following his first term.\n\nBoth investigations produced indictments that were abandoned by Smith's team after Trump's November 2024 election win in light of longstanding Justice Department legal opinions that say sitting presidents cannot face federal prosecution.\n\nThe volume on the election investigation was released in the final days of the Biden administration. But Cannon, a Trump-appointed judge in Florida who issued multiple favorable rulings for Trump and his two co-defendants in the classified documents case, last year granted a defense request to at least temporarily halt the release of the report dealing with that case. That edict meant that Smith could not discuss the substance of that investigation when he testified Thursday before the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe injunction is set to lift on February 24.\n\nBut Jason Reding Quiñones, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, where the case was filed, said in a three-page court filing that the report should remain sealed. He and another prosecutor in that office, Manolo Reboso, wrote that Smith's investigation was “unlawful from its inception.”\n\nThey also wrote that Attorney General Pam Bondi had determined that the report was “an internal deliberative communication that is privileged and confidential and should not be released” outside the Justice Department.\n\n“Smith not only weaponized the Department of Justice against a leading presidential candidate in pursuit of an anti-democratic end, but he did so without legal authority and while targeting constitutionally protected activity,” the prosecutors wrote.\n\nSmith, during his testimony Thursday, defended his investigations of Trump and insisted that he had acted without regard to politics and had no second thoughts about the criminal charges he brought.\n\n“No one should be above the law in our country, and the law required that he be held to account. So that is what I did,” Smith said of Trump.",

    "description": "A federal judge in Georgia on Friday dismissed a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit seeking voter information from the state, ruling the federal government had sued in the wrong city.  U.S.",
    "fullText": "ATLANTA (AP) — A federal judge in Georgia on Friday dismissed a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit seeking voter information from the state, ruling the federal government had sued in the wrong city.\n\nU.S. District Judge Ashley Royal found the government should have sued Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in Atlanta, and not in a separate federal judicial district in Macon, where the secretary of state also has an office.\n\nRoyal dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice, meaning the Justice Department can refile it. The department declined to comment Friday.\n\nThe Justice Department has now filed lawsuits against 24 states and the District of Columbia seeking voter information as part of its effort to collect detailed voting data, including dates of birth and driver’s license and Social Security numbers. A federal judge in California rejected the lawsuit against that state on privacy grounds, while a judge in Oregon has suggested he may dismiss the case there.\n\nThe Trump administration characterizes the lawsuits as an effort to ensure election security, and the Justice Department says the states are violating federal law by refusing to provide voter lists and information.\n\nRaffensperger has been the rare Republican to decline the demand, saying Georgia law prohibits the release of voters' confidential personal unless certain qualifications are met. Raffensperger argues the federal government hasn't met those conditions. He says he shared the public part of the voter roll and information about how Georgia removes ineligible or outdated registrations in December.\n\n“I will always follow the law and follow the Constitution,” Raffensperger said in a statement Friday. “I won't violate the oath I took to stand up for the people of this state, regardless of who or what compels me to do otherwise.”\n\nThe refusal to hand over the records has become an issue in Raffensperger's 2026 run for governor. Raffensperger in January 2021 famously refused a demand from President Donald Trump in a phone call to “find” enough votes to overturn Democrat Joe Biden’s win in Georgia's 2020 presidential election. Many Trump-loving Republicans still hold a grudge against Raffensperger.\n\nThe issue flared just Thursday in a hearing by a state Senate committee where multiple Republican state senators slammed Raffensperger for failing to comply, saying he legally could do so. The committee voted along party lines to advance a resolution calling on Raffensperger to hand over the data and calling it the “latest example of a pattern of behavior by the secretary and his office to refuse oversight of his administration of Georgia’s elections.”\n\nState Sen. Randy Robertson, a Republican from Cataula who filed the resolution, said the dismissal is “frustrating” because even if the Justice Department refiles the lawsuit, the problem will take longer to resolve.\n\n“As public officials we all should participate in any investigation done by a law enforcement agency,” Robertson told The Associated Press Friday.\n\nRobertson is one of many Republican lawmakers backing Lt. Gov. Burt Jones over Raffensperger for the GOP governor nomination. Jones, who already has Trump's endorsement for governor, was one of 16 state Republicans who signed a certificate that Trump had won Georgia and declaring themselves the state’s “duly elected and qualified” electors.",
