    "fullText": "SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) — A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit against California that sought detailed voting records and personal data on its 23 million registered voters, concluding that the government's request was “unprecedented and illegal.”\n\nThe Trump administration's lawsuit, filed last year, contended that California and other states were illegally blocking the federal government's wide-ranging effort to scrutinize detailed voter data that states said was private and protected.\n\nThe administration “may not unilaterally usurp the authority over elections” U.S. District Judge David O. Carter in Santa Ana said in his 33-page decision.\n\nFurthermore, the attempt to gather and centralize the personal information would have a chilling effect on voter registration and threaten “the right to vote which is the cornerstone of American democracy,” the judge ruled.\n\n“There cannot be unbridled consolidation of all elections power in the executive (branch) without action from Congress,” Carter said. “This is antithetical to the promise of fair and free elections.”\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nIt has accused states of failing to respond sufficiently to questions about the procedures they take to maintain voter rolls. The department has sued 23 states, most of them controlled by Democrats, and the District of Columbia for detailed voter data that includes names, dates of birth, residential addresses, driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers.\n\nState election officials have questioned what the DOJ plans to do with that information. Last fall 10 Democratic secretaries of state wrote Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to express concern over reports that the DOJ was sharing state voter data with the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of DHS, operates a program that checks citizenship status.\n\nCalifornia Secretary of State Shirley Weber, the state's chief elections officer, said in a statement that California would “continue to challenge this administration’s disregard for the rule of law and our right to vote.”",

    "fullText": "The internet has a surprising new muse: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nPowell is famously mild-mannered. About four times a year, he emerges from meetings with Federal Reserve governors and regional bank presidents to hold press conferences on their analysis of jobs data, inflation reports, and subsequent interest rate projections (the infamous \"dot plot\").\n\nNot exactly typical fodder for going viral. But on Monday, after Powell released a video saying he'd been subpoenaed by the Justice Department as part of a pressure campaign, he started getting the meme treatment.\n\n\"I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy,\" Powell said in Sunday's two-minute video. \"But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"\n\nSocial media thought it was a banger.\n\nIn this house, Jerome Powell is a herohttps://t.co/VNfAnNCan3 pic.twitter.com/B6LRbKBD7D\n\nhttps://t.co/gHat9QbklK pic.twitter.com/IPxgoITbyx\n\nA post shared by Archegos Capital (@archegoscapital)\n\nYou know things are bad when the most boring person doing the most boring job for decades has to come out and say, “Stop trying to arrest us for doing math” https://t.co/3YCfPBFIae\n\nJerome Powell walking to the office this morning pic.twitter.com/wYibAekAmy\n\nMarco Rubio finding out he has to be chairman of the Federal Reserve pic.twitter.com/Ajzro16AuS\n\nWE ARE JEROME POWELL! pic.twitter.com/faTyYRcXLa\n\nNo the Resistance is fine, I just didn’t realize it would be lead by Jerome Powell https://t.co/JJvzkmylOo\n\nPresident Donald Trump has called on Powell, whose term doesn't end until May 2026, to lower interest rates more quickly.

    "description": "Stocks, bonds, and the dollar fell amid the DOJ's investigation into Powell. Credit card stocks plunged after Trump said interest should be capped.",
    "fullText": "The \"sell America\" trade is seeing a revival on Monday.\n\nInvestors were reacting to developments over the weekend, including a proposal to cap credit card interest rates and the Department of Justice's criminal investigation of Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nMajor indexes were down in early morning trading, with the Dow dropping more than 400 points as investors took in the news.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Monday:\n\nThe Justice Department's probe relates to the Fed Chair's testimony last year about the renovation of the Fed's office buildings, a project Trump has criticized for its cost.\n\nTrump, who said he has decided on his pick to replace Powell when the Fed Chair's term ends his May, said he had no knowledge of the probe when speaking to NBC Sunday evening.\n\n\"I don't know anything about it, but he's certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings,\" he said.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe market has a complicated reaction to situations when it appears that Trump is applying pressure on Powell. The president has demanded that the Fed chief lower interest rates for years, including in his first term. The concern is that if rates are lowered prematurely, it could backfire and cause inflation to flare up again, which would force the central bank to turn hawkish and potentially hike rates down the road.\n\nThe knee-jerk reaction among investors is something markets have seen before.\n\n\"All these moves suggest a possible return of the 'sell America' trade,\" Paul Hickey, the co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, wrote in a note on Monday, referring to the broad sell-off in US assets in 2025 as investors fretted over tariffs and the health of the economy.\n\n\"Investors rushed to cut their exposure to US assets,\" David Morrison, a senior market analyst at Trade Nation, wrote in a note, pointing to concerns about the Fed's independence. \"Investors were also rattled by the Fed Chair's robust response,\" he added, referring to the video statement from Powell released on Sunday.\n\nHere were the moves investors saw Monday morning.\n\nTreasury yields were up as US debt securities faced selling pressure. The benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield climbed two basis points.\n\n\"Treasury yields are higher, and the curve is steeper amid fresh attacks on the Federal Reserve's independence,\" John Canavan, a lead analyst at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note on Monday.\n\nInvestors have shed Treasurys in other times when the president has meddled with the Fed or threatened Powell. Yields spiked last April when Trump first said he could fire the Fed chair, with the president tempering his views following big bouts of selling in the Treasury market.\n\nGold, which acts as a hedge against inflation and a haven during bouts of geopolitical turmoil, soared to records, rising 2% and breaking through $4,600 for the first time on Monday.\n\nThe precious metal is up 4% from levels at the start of the year and just recorded its best-ever annual run since 1979, around the time inflation began to soar in the US.\n\nDemand for safe havens looks \"strong,\" particularly as investors continue to weigh tensions between the US and other countries, like Venezuela and Greenland, Trade Nation's Morrison said.\n\nOther metals that typically rally alongside gold, like silver and copper, were also up.\n\nThe US Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, declined 0.4% on Monday, a possible sign that investors are reducing their exposure to dollar assets due to concerns about the Fed's independence.\n\n\"The investigation into Mr Powell has raised concerns about the Fed's autonomy, an unfavourable backdrop for the greenback,\" Morrison said.\n\n\"The broader fear is that the move could continue to erode Fed autonomy, which may raise long-term inflation expectations and be bearish for the greenback,\" Enrique Diaz-Alvarez, the chief economist at Ebury, wrote in a note.\n\nThe financial sector was rocked after Trump proposed that credit card interest rates be capped at 10% for a one-year period in a post on Truth Social.\n\n\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration. AFFORDABILITY!\" Trump wrote on his social media platform.\n\n\"Trump's proposal to cap credit card rates at 10% for a year added another layer of uncertainty, particularly for banks,\" Morrison added.",

He described the move as a part of a broader effort to pressure the central bank on monetary policy.\n\nProminent economists and business leaders are reacting as the news hit markets at the start of the trading week. They weighed in on how the DOJ move affects the Fed's independence, a question also raised by Sen. Thom Tillis. On Sunday, the Republican said he would oppose nominees for the Fed.\n\n\"If there were any remaining doubt about whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,\" Tillis said in a statement.\n\nHere's what leaders in economics and business are saying:\n\nProminent economist Mohamed El-Erian called for Powell's resignation months ago to protect the Fed's independence amid the feud with Trump.\n\nOn Sunday, El-Erian wrote on X that the inquiry into Powell is damaging for the US central bank.\n\n\"For those of us who value the operational autonomy of central banks, the risk is that this situation could expose deeper issues — further undermining the credibility of a Fed whose public standing is already fragile,\" wrote El-Erian, who is a former co-chief investment officer at Pimco.\n\nLinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman raised concerns about the Fed's independence.\n\n\"Question to all those who said Trump would be better for the economy: is attacking the Fed's independence what you had in mind?\" wrote the prominent Democratic donor on X.\n\nPeter Schiff, the chief economist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, attributed the gold price surge to fresh record highs on Sunday evening to the investigation into Powell.\n\n\"I am not a fan of Powell, but I agree with him on Trump's motivation,\" Schiff, whose firm managed $1.4 billion last year, wrote on X.\n\nIn April, Schiff said Trump's next Fed Chair pick would be a \"loyal soldier.\"\n\nMichael A. Gayed, a renowned investment manager, said direct action against a sitting Fed Chair is \"without modern precedent,\" in an edition of his Lead-Lag substack report published on Sunday evening.\n\nThe inquiry into Powell raises questions about whether the long-standing boundaries between fiscal power, prosecutorial authority, and monetary independence are beginning to blur, Gayed said. The concern was less about any single case and more about the future precedent it may establish.\n\n\"Should investors conclude that future Fed officials could face legal consequences for policy decisions that conflict with political priorities, the incentive structure governing monetary policy could change,\" said Gayed.\n\nThat shift could increase inflation risk premiums and weaken confidence in long-duration financial assets tied to stable policy expectations, he added.",

The Fed chair said the subpoenas were the latest move in the Trump administration's pressure campaign on the central bank to lower interest rates.\n\n\"No one — certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve — is above the law,\" Powell said. \"But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.\"\n\nPowell also suggested that this latest threat won't lead to his departure from his position, which President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for. Powell said he would continue to do his job.\n\nThe dollar and US stock futures fell on concerns about the Fed's independence on Sunday. Gold, seen as a haven investment, rose as much as 2%.\n\nFollowing Powell's statement, Trump denied having any knowledge of the Justice Department's investigation into the central bank.\n\n\"I don't know anything about it, but he's certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings,\" Trump said of Powell in an interview with NBC News Sunday night.\n\nThe $2.5 billion planned headquarters renovations have become a major talking point for White House officials, who have accused Powell of overspending and breaking oversight laws.\n\nIn July, Trump said that Powell's actions were \"sort of\" grounds for dismissal but later said he was \"highly unlikely\" to fire Powell, unless it was for \"fraud.\" Powell has defended the renovations.\n\nTrump has urged the Federal Reserve — an independent government agency — to lower interest rates as part of his plan to spur the American economy.\n\nIn its December meeting, the Fed cut rates to a range of 3.5%—3.75%, following similar reductions in September and October. After the meeting, Trump called Fed Chair Jerome Powell \"a stiff\" who approved a \"rather small\" cut and said the cut could have been \"at least doubled.\"\n\nThe president has also targeted Lisa Cook, a Fed governor. In August, he asked her to resign immediately due to allegations that Cook had committed illicit activity related to two mortgage loans.

    "description": "Major gauges made slight losses as Wall Street prepares for a week of major releases against a backdrop of global volatility.",
    "fullText": "US stock futures dropped Sunday night as Wall Street reacted to the Trump administration opening a criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) and futures on the S&P 500 (ES=F) fell 0.5%. Contracts tied to the Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) slumped 0.8%.\n\nInvestors were rattled late Sunday evening after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell released a statement revealing that the Department of Justice had subpoenaed the US central bank.\n\nIn an uncharacteristic video address, Powell stated \"the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June.\"\n\nPowell claimed that the move was a direct attack for the setting of interest rates that \"serve the public\" rather than \"following the preferences of the President.\"\n\nThe tumultuous start follows a strong finish to last week, when stocks climbed to fresh record highs. Both the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Dow (^DJI) closed Friday at new peaks, extending a rally that pushed the S&P 500 up more than 1% for the week. The Dow and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) posted even stronger gains, rising 2.3% and 1.9%, respectively.\n\nThe significant escalation in Trump’s feud with the Fed chair comes as markets are bracing for the latest consumer inflation report, due Tuesday. The release comes on the heels of Friday’s December jobs report, which showed continued cooling in the labor market without signaling a sharp economic slowdown.\n\nTaken together, the data has reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will remain on hold for now, with CME FedWatch offering a 95% probability of rates staying the same.\n\nBeyond the economic calendar, geopolitical developments remain a wildcard. President Trump is reportedly weighing potential action involving Iran, while also escalating pressure on Cuba over Venezuelan oil shipments. Late last week, Trump also renewed controversial comments about Greenland, saying the US could pursue control of the Danish territory “whether they like it or not.”\n\nInvestors are now turning their attention to the first major catalysts of 2026: earnings season and key inflation data. Several of Wall Street’s biggest banks are set to report in the coming days, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS).\n\nVISHNU VARATHAN, HEAD OF ⁠MACRO RESEARCH, ASIA EX-JAPAN, ‌MIZUHO, SINGAPORE\n\n\"The Fed independence question is now well and alive and maybe subject to re-evaluation every few meetings.\n\n\"I think ‍I'm still not sure how sustained and adversarial the attack on the Fed might be. There could be a scenario where Trump could still appoint someone with ​some credibility and allow this person to run the show - so ‌that's probably why markets aren't panicking as yet.\"\n\nANDREW LILLEY, CHIEF RATES STRATEGIST AT BARRENJOEY, SYDNEY\n\n\"Trump is pulling at the loose threads of central bank independence. I don't even believe that he expects that Chair Powell will be charged... The only reason that he's taking these steps is that ⁠he knows that he's not going to ​take control of the Fed, so he ​wants to exert as much undue pressure as he can.\n\n\"It is not good. Don't get me wrong, but I think ‍it will amount to ⁠nothing. Investors won't be happy about it, but it shows actually Trump has no other levers to pull. The cash rate ⁠will stay what the majority of the FOMC wants them to be.\"",

    "description": "Jeffrey Epstein's wills named figures like Larry Summers and Jes Staley as possible executors, DOJ files show.",
    "fullText": "As he planned for his death, Jeffrey Epstein listed powerful friends and associates from Wall Street as the people who would take care of his affairs.\n\nVersions of Epstein's will released Tuesday by the Justice Department featured former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, former Barclays CEO Jes Staley, and former Bear Stearns CEO Jimmy Cayne as potential executors of his estate.\n\nThe final version of Epstein's will — which was signed in August of 2019, while he was in jail awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges in Manhattan, and shortly before he killed himself — listed his longtime personal lawyer, Darren Indyke, and accountant Richard Kahn as his estate executors.\n\nThe older versions of Epstein's will were released following the passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which required the Justice Department to make its Epstein-related files public. In addition to Epstein's 2019 indictment, his associate Ghislaine Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2021 for trafficking girls to him, and in 2008, he pleaded guilty to a crime involving sexual misconduct with a minor.\n\nThe files include references to many of Epstein's powerful associates, including President Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton. Inclusion in the documents isn't an indication of wrongdoing.\n\nCayne, who died in 2021, was listed as a co-executor for Epstein's estate in versions of Epstein's will signed in 2003 and 2004. Epstein worked at Bear Stearns in the 1980s, before becoming a financial advisor to billionaires Les Wexner and Leon Black.\n\nCayne's daughter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn 2012, Epstein listed Staley — who was then an executive at JPMorgan Chase — as a backup executor to his will. In 2013, Staley was promoted to co-executor status, alongside Indyke.\n\nStaley kept the position as co-executor of Epstein's will in the 2014 version as well. By then, Epstein had listed Summers as a backup executor.\n\nAn attorney for Staley didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Staley said in a 2019 letter to a UK regulator that he did not have a close relationship with Epstein.\n\nStaley stepped down as the CEO of Barclays in 2021 following an investigation into his ties with Epstein from the British bank regulator, which banned him from working in the financial industry. A UK court earlier this year upheld Staley's ban, finding that he lied about having a \"purely professional\" relationship with Epstein.\n\nSummers stepped down from his teaching post at Harvard and from his board seat at OpenAI following the release of numerous emails between him and Epstein by the House Oversight Committee last month.\n\nSteven Goldberg, a spokesperson for Summers, said in a statement that the economist was not involved in Epstein's financial life.\n\n\"Mr. Summers had absolutely no knowledge that he was included in an early version of Epstein's will and had no involvement in his financial matters or the administration of his estate,\" Goldberg said in a statement to Business Insider.\n\nEpstein also included another prominent figure in the penultimate version of his will. A draft of the will, released by the House Oversight Committee earlier this year, listed top Goldman Sachs lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler as the backup estate executor.\n\nRuemmler, through JPMorgan, declined to comment when the will was released by the House Oversight Committee earlier this month.",

    "title": "Impeachable: Pam Bondi Defied Federal Law by Erasing Epstein Photos to Protect Trump",
    "description": "The DOJ removed already-public Epstein files in defiance of a disclosure statute, prompting bipartisan outrage and impeachment talk from the law’s authors.",
    "fullText": "(Evan Vucci/The Associated Press)\n\nThe Justice Department is now engaged in an open cover-up carried out in direct violation of federal law.\n\nOver the weekend, the department quietly removed 16 photographs from the Epstein files website it created to comply with a disclosure statute passed by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump. The removals came without notice or explanation. Among the deleted images was one of the few photographs that even indirectly featured Trump, a picture of a credenza drawer inside Jeffrey Epstein’s Manhattan home containing other photographs, including at least one of Trump. Twelve others depicted Epstein’s third-floor massage room, a central crime scene in the federal investigation. Some images of the same room remain public. Others disappeared.\n\nWhen Democrats on the House Oversight Committee asked whether the Trump-related image had been taken down, the Justice Department declined to respond.\n\nWhat followed made matters worse.\n\nIn a post on X quoting Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, the Justice Department claimed that “photos and other materials will continue being reviewed and redacted consistent with the law in an abundance of caution as we receive additional information.” Blanche’s original post asserted that the department had released Epstein materials “under the Epstein Files Transparency Act” and that additional disclosures would follow “as our review continues, consistent with the law and with protections for victims.”\n\nThat explanation fails under the statute the department invoked.\n\nCongress did not authorize a rolling review. The Epstein Files Transparency Act compels the Justice Department to release all Epstein-related materials in its possession. The law imposes a mandatory disclosure obligation and permits only limited redactions to protect victims. It grants no authority to retract, revise, or curate records after release. Once the department published those materials, the law required that they remain available to the public.\n\nRemoving them placed the department in direct conflict with the statute Congress enacted.\n\nThat conflict was immediately recognized. Blanche’s post received a community note stating that the law requires the release of all files and allows only narrow redactions to protect victims, adding that the department’s partial release and extensive redactions violated the statute. The Justice Department’s own post received a community note citing the statute directly and stating that retractions and redactions to protect politically exposed persons are not permitted. Community Notes appear only when users with differing political viewpoints agree on their accuracy, underscoring how broadly that conclusion was shared.\n\nThe department’s own explanation confirms it is violating the law it claims to follow.\n\nThe sequence exposes motive. The files went live. Political reaction followed. The department then altered the public record. Compliance held only until presidential exposure appeared, then gave way to erasure.\n\nIn November, I described the Trump Justice Department’s handling of the Epstein files as a cover-up. Last week, I wrote that the administration’s delay in disclosure created a political problem rather than an immediate legal one. That assessment reflected weak enforcement mechanisms and an approach built on delay rather than open defiance.\n\nRemoving already released material that implicates the president converts a credibility crisis into a statutory violation and a far larger political emergency. Congress passed the Epstein disclosure statute precisely to eliminate executive discretion. Lawmakers acted because the Justice Department repeatedly demonstrated it could not be trusted to manage politically sensitive material involving powerful figures. The law mandated disclosure to prevent executive self-protection.\n\nThe department seized that discretion anyway.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi had lawful options. She could have sought judicial review. She could have consulted Congress. She could have acknowledged that the statute permits no removal authority and sought amendment. Each path would have preserved institutional legitimacy. She chose concealment and false justification instead.\n\nThis erasure differs from earlier Trump-era document fights in a crucial way. Prior disputes centered on whether materials must be disclosed. This episode involves evidence already released to the public under statutory standards. The department determined the images satisfied the law’s requirements, then removed them once the political cost became apparent.\n\nEvery disclosure statute now faces the same test: compliance survives only until it threatens the president. Months of delay, sweeping redactions, and staged releases already convinced much of the public that the Justice Department prioritized Trump’s standing over transparency, victims, and the public interest. The image removals confirm that conclusion decisively.\n\nA Justice Department that edits evidence to shield the president forfeits legitimacy. Oversight collapses when obedience ends at political inconvenience. The rule of law depends on statutes binding the executive even when compliance proves costly.\n\nCongress wrote a law to prevent exactly this abuse. The president signed it. The attorney general is now violating it to protect him. That meets any reasonable standard for impeachment.\n\nThe backlash on Capitol Hill was immediate and bipartisan. Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, who co-authored the Epstein Files Transparency Act, and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who forced the House vote compelling disclosure, both said the Justice Department failed to comply with the law. Khanna has confirmed that he and Massie are drafting impeachment and contempt measures against Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\nCongress now faces a choice. It can accept that disclosure laws apply only when politically painless. It can normalize the disappearance of already public evidence. It can allow executive power to override legislative command.\n\nOr it can enforce the law it wrote.\n\nThis is a cover-up enforced through executive defiance. The question now is whether Congress will enforce its own laws.\n\nThe post Impeachable: Pam Bondi Defied Federal Law by Erasing Epstein Photos to Protect Trump first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Angel Ureña, the deputy chief of staff to Bill Clinton, spoke out after his boss was featured prominently in Epstein files released by the Trump DOJ.",
    "fullText": "Angel Ureña, the deputy chief of staff to Bill Clinton, spoke out after his boss was featured prominently in Epstein files released by the Trump DOJ, accusing the current administration of trying to use the former president as a “scapegoat.”\n\n“The White House hasn’t been hiding these files for months only to dump them late on a Friday to protect Bill Clinton,” Ureña, who has worked for Clinton for several decades, said in statement on X. “This is about shielding themselves from what comes next, or from what they’ll try and hide forever. So they can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, this isn’t about Bill Clinton. Never has, never will be.”\n\nAs Ureña went on, he called out Trump chief of staff Susie Wiles, noting the latter said on the record that “Donald Trump was wrong about Bill Clinton” and his claim that the prominent Democrat visited Epstein’s infamous private island multiple times. (Wiles later clarified that there was “no evidence” proving Trump’s claims.)\n\n“There are two types of people here,” Clinton’s deputy chief of staff continued. “The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We’re in the first. No amount of stalling by people in the second group will change that.”\n\nPer Ureña, “everyone, especially MAGA, expects answers, not scapegoats.”\n\nRepresentative for the White House and the DOJ did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment.\n\nThe federal government began releasing files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, a month after President Trump ordered their release following a bipartisan push in Congress. As journalists began to comb through the files, photos of Clinton and Michael Jackson surfaced — though, large chunks of the files had also been redacted.\n\nMany have criticized the DOJ over the release, with many noting the Epstein Files Transparency Act meant the government was meant to hand over all of the documents Friday.\n\nThough, the White House has sung a different tune over the files drop. White House spokesperson Abigail Johnson said in a statement that “the Trump Administration is the most transparent in history.”\n\n“By releasing thousands of pages of documents, cooperating with the House Oversight Committee’s subpoena request, and President Trump recently calling for further investigations into Epstein’s Democrat friends, the Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have,” she said.\n\nThe post Bill Clinton’s Deputy Chief of Staff Hits Back at Trump Administration Over Epstein Files Drop: ‘They’ll Try and Hide Forever’ appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "description": "The DOJ has released new documents on Jeffrey Epstein, the well-connected financier who died in jail while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.",
    "fullText": "The Justice Department has officially released documents on Jeffrey Epstein, the well-connected financier who killed himself in jail while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in 2019.\n\nFriday's disclosure is the first of what are expected to be several rounds of document releases over the coming weeks as the DOJ scrambles to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law in November.\n\nThe documents contain a trove of photos, some of which feature famous names such as former President Bill Clinton, Michael Jackson, and singer Diana Ross.\n\nWhile a past relationship with Epstein is no indication of wrongdoing, his victims and other members of the public have pushed for the disclosure in hopes that the DOJ's records might shed light on those connections and law enforcement's handling of the case.\n\nSo what else do the latest Epstein files contain? Business Insider reporters have begun looking through the documents and photos and we'll be reporting out highlights as they're discovered.\n\nA bipartisan duo of House lawmakers responsible for pushing the Epstein files bill through Congress is displeased with the Justice Department's release of documents thus far and publicly proposing remedies.\n\n\"Unfortunately, today's document release by @AGPamBondi and @DAGToddBlanche grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law that @realDonaldTrump signed just 30 days ago,\" Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, wrote on X. \"@RepRoKhanna is correct.\"\n\nA bipartisan duo of House lawmakers responsible for pushing the Epstein files bill through Congress is displeased with the Justice Department's release of documents thus far and publicly proposing remedies.\n\n\"Unfortunately, today's document release by @AGPamBondi and @DAGToddBlanche grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law that @realDonaldTrump signed just 30 days ago,\" Rep.

Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, said it was unacceptable that many documents remain redacted, despite the law allowing only narrow exceptions and requiring explanations for such redactions. He threatened the possibility of impeachment if Justice Department officials do not comply, though such action would require at least some Republican support.\n\n\"Thomas Massie and I are exploring all options,\" Khanna said in a video posted on X. \"It can be the impeachment of people at Justice, inherent contempt, or referring for prosecution those who are obstructing justice.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, Epstein's longtime friend and sex trafficking accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, features heavily in the files dropped on Friday. The files include photos of them traveling together and her dressed up in a uniform.\n\nThe daughter of a British media Tycoon, Maxwell was a constant presence in Epstein's life over the decades. The two were even romantically involved at one point.\n\nMaxwell is serving a 20-year sentence at a minimum-security federal prison in Texas for her role in Epstein's sex trafficking operation.Read full story\n\nSome redactions to the files are drawing ire online.\n\n\"Breaking News: The Epstein Files,\" wrote Julie K. Brown, a journalist whose investigation at the Miami Herald led to the arrest of Epstein, alongside a screenshot of a fully redacted document.\n\nSome redactions to the files are drawing ire online.\n\n\"Breaking News: The Epstein Files,\" wrote Julie K.

Spacey himself has faced sexual misconduct allegations, but has been cleared of charges in jury trials in New York and London.\n\nRepresentatives for Spacey and Clinton did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe DOJ has been investigating Epstein for the better part of two decades, starting around 2006 after local police in Palm Beach, Florida, began looking into complaints that he was luring young girls to his mansion by promising them money for massages.\n\nIt's no wonder then that the agency has so much data that Friday's drop — despite being a partial release —was broken into four parts.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton, pop star Michael Jackson, and singer Diana Ross are among the wealthy and powerful individuals included in the thousands of images released by the Justice Department.\n\nBeing featured in the photographs released, or having a tie to Epstein, is not an indication of wrongdoing, and it's unclear what the context of some of the photos might be. Clinton has long been connected to Epstein and took multiple trips on the disgraced financier's private plane.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton, pop star Michael Jackson, and singer Diana Ross are among the wealthy and powerful individuals included in the thousands of images released by the Justice Department.\n\nBeing featured in the photographs released, or having a tie to Epstein, is not an indication of wrongdoing, and it's unclear what the context of some of the photos might be. Clinton has long been connected to Epstein and took multiple trips on the disgraced financier's private plane.\n\nIn the newly released photos, Clinton is seen alongside Michael Jackson and singer Diana Ross. Another set of photos show the former president swimming and later relaxing in what appears to be a hot tub.\n\nJackson was also previously connected to Epstein, including a mention in court documents related to the prosecution of Epstein's co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nRepresentatives for Clinton, Ross, and Jackson's estate did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nThe Epstein files archive is organized into sections and divided by topic: court records, DOJ dislcosures, Freedom of Information Act requests, and disclosures from the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.\n\nAlthough the library contains a search function, it has limited functionality as the site notes, which warns that the search results may be \"unreliable\" due to the format of the documents.\n\nThe Epstein files archive is organized into sections and divided by topic: court records, DOJ dislcosures, Freedom of Information Act requests, and disclosures from the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.\n\nAlthough the library contains a search function, it has limited functionality as the site notes, which warns that the search results may be \"unreliable\" due to the format of the documents.\n\nMany of the documents are so heavily redacted, it is difficult to discern the context of the files. Others are duplicates of previously released records. There are also many, many photos.\n\nA note on the homepage indicates that, should additional responsive documents be identified in accordance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, they will be added to the archive.\n\nIncluded among the photos were images of former President Bill Clinton, Mick Jagger, and Michael Jackson at gatherings with Epstein. One collection of photos included a series of nude photographs, redacted so as not to be explicit.\n\nOther images appear to be from Epstein's Manhattan home, including photos of his bedroom, risque wall art, what appeared to be an effigy hanging from the staircase, and a taxidermied tiger.\n\n\"The Trump Administration is the most transparent in history. By releasing thousands of pages of documents, cooperating with the House Oversight Committee's subpoena request, and President Trump recently calling for further investigations into Epstein's Democrat friends, the Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have. And while President Trump is delivering on his promises, Democrats like Hakeem Jeffries and Stacey Plaskett have yet to explain why they were soliciting money and meetings from Epstein after he was a convicted sex offender. The American people deserve answers.\" Abigail Jackson WH spokeswoman\n\nThe DOJ added several warning notices about its Epstein documents. One advised that \"certain portions of this library may not be appropriate for all readers\" due to their descriptions of sexual assault.\n\nAnother warned that some people's personal information could be shared, and suggested that it was the fault of the legislation.\n\nThe DOJ added several warning notices about its Epstein documents.

However, queue numbers were only valid for 10 minutes before expiring, resulting in the loss of your place in line.\n\n\"We are currently experiencing extremely high volume of search requests at this time,\" reads a display screen where viewers were forced to wait in line. \"We have placed you in a waiting queue and we will process your search request as soon as we can.

You can find them here.\n\nThe big question is what they contain and whether they are searchable.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said earlier Friday that the DOJ will not release its complete trove of documents on Friday as required by the legislation. He said to expect \"several hundred thousand documents today,\" including photos, and the rest \"over the next couple of weeks.\"\n\nIn speaking to Fox News on Friday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said to expect at least some photos in Friday's batch of documents.\n\n\"I expect that we're going to release several hundred thousand documents today, and those documents will come in all different forms — photographs and other materials associated with the investigation into Mr. Epstein,\" Blanche said.\n\nIn speaking to Fox News on Friday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said to expect at least some photos in Friday's batch of documents.\n\n\"I expect that we're going to release several hundred thousand documents today, and those documents will come in all different forms — photographs and other materials associated with the investigation into Mr. Epstein,\" Blanche said.\n\nIn recent weeks, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have released new photos they obtained through subpoenas of Epstein's estate. We've seen titans of industry like Richard Branson, Bill Gates, and Sergey Brin.\n\nSchiff responded to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who told Fox News on Friday morning that the DOJ would \"release several hundred thousand documents today,\" but would fall short of releasing all files.\n\n\"The Epstein Files Transparency Act is clear: while protecting survivors, ALL of these records are required to be released today,\" Schiff wrote on Bluesky. \"Not just some.\"\n\nSchiff responded to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who told Fox News on Friday morning that the DOJ would \"release several hundred thousand documents today,\" but would fall short of releasing all files.\n\n\"The Epstein Files Transparency Act is clear: while protecting survivors, ALL of these records are required to be released today,\" Schiff wrote on Bluesky. \"Not just some.\"\n\n\"The Trump administration can't move the goalposts. They're cemented in law,\" Schiff added.\n\nThe Epstein Files Transparency Act, signed into law on November 19, states that the documents can be released no \"later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\" According to the law, the attorney general needs to \"make publicly available in a searchable and downloadable format all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in the possession of the Department of Justice.\"\n\nIn 2019, ahead of Epstein's arrest and suicide, Steve Bannon filmed what he said were 15 hours of interviews with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThat footage has remained under wraps. If the footage was on Epstein's hard drives, however, the DOJ might have obtained it when the FBI seized his electronic devices around the time of his arrest on sex-trafficking charges.\n\nRecently released text messages between Epstein and Bannon have shed some light on the project, which was intended to be a promotional documentary to burnish Epstein's reputation.\n\nRead that story here:Read full story\n\nJustice Department officials told multiple news outlets earlier today that the files will be released at 3 p.m. ET.\n\nThe DOJ has now missed that deadline. By law, it has until midnight tonight to release all of its files related to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nJustice Department officials told multiple news outlets earlier today that the files will be released at 3 p.m. ET.\n\nThe DOJ has now missed that deadline. By law, it has until midnight tonight to release all of its files related to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nWhile the specifics of what will be in the files released on Friday aren't clear, here is some of what is anticipated:\n\nThe Justice Department is pushing back on criticism that it is not meeting the statutory deadline, characterizing it as an \"initial deadline\" — though the law does not call it that.\n\n\"The Trump administration is providing levels of transparency that prior administrations never even contemplated,\" the Justice Department's office of public affairs wrote on X. \"The initial deadline is being met as we work diligently to protect victims.\"\n\nThe Justice Department is pushing back on criticism that it is not meeting the statutory deadline, characterizing it as an \"initial deadline\" — though the law does not call it that.\n\n\"The Trump administration is providing levels of transparency that prior administrations never even contemplated,\" the Justice Department's office of public affairs wrote on X. \"The initial deadline is being met as we work diligently to protect victims.\"\n\nThe White House initially opposed the transparency law until enough Republican lawmakers broke with GOP leadership to join House Democrats, forcing a vote on the bill. After it became clear Congress would move ahead anyway, Trump flipped his stance on the legislation.\n\nDuring Epstein's 2019 arrest, the FBI searched his Manhattan townhouse and his home in the US Virgin Islands. In the process, they obtained more than 70 computers, iPads, and hard drives, along with financial documents and binders full of CDs.\n\nThose seized materials form the heart of the \"Epstein files,\" which could shed even more light on the deepest, darkest secrets of the notorious pedophile.\n\nThose could include more emails and text messages, as well as internal prosecutorial records. The Justice Department has overseen two different criminal investigations into Epstein's sexual abuse of teenage girls. The first took place in Florida and led to a widely criticized plea deal in 2008. The second was the Manhattan-based investigation, which led to Epstein's 2019 arrest and Maxwell's prosecution.\n\n\"We are now examining all legal options in the face of this violation of federal law,\" Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Robert Garcia of California said in a joint statement. \"The survivors of this nightmare deserve justice, the co-conspirators must be held accountable, and the American people deserve complete transparency from DOJ.\"\n\nRaskin and Garcia serve as the top Democrats on the powerful House Judiciary Committee and the Oversight Committee, respectively. Since Democrats control neither chamber of Congress, their power to force the immediate disclosure of the documents is more limited.\n\nEarlier today, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the Justice Department would not meet the legal deadline imposed by bipartisan legislation that President Donald Trump signed into law in November that requires the DOJ to release \"all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" regarding Epstein and his conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\n\"I expect that we're going to release more documents over the next couple of weeks, so today several hundred thousand and then over the next couple weeks, I expect several hundred thousand more,\" Blanche said during an interview on Fox News.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell, Epstein's co-conspirator, was found guilty of sex trafficking and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Civil lawsuits involving Epstein, Maxwell, banks affiliated with Epstein, and the US Virgin Islands government have shaken loose even more details about his life. Various drips and drabs have also entered the public domain through Freedom of Information Act requests, government reports, and an inquiry from the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nAll of that may pale in comparison to what the Justice Department has in its possession.\n\nYes. In recent months, the House Oversight Committee has made public Epstein-related documents it obtained through subpoenas, including emails provided by his estate and never-before-seen photos of some of Epstein's powerful acquaintances, including Trump, Bill Gates, Larry Summers, and Steve Bannon.\n\nThose disclosures have already led to some fallout. Summers, a former Treasury Secretary, has been barred from the American Economic Association for life and is no longer teaching classes at Harvard University, pending an investigation.\n\nEpstein killed himself in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. He was known for rubbing elbows with powerful people — even after he was convicted of soliciting sex from a minor in 2008. Over the years, he has counted Trump, Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and other titans of finance, law, politics, and science among his acquaintances.\n\nWhile a past relationship with Epstein is no indication of wrongdoing, his victims and other members of the public have pushed for the disclosure in hopes that the DOJ's records might shed light on those relationships and law enforcement's handling of the case.",
