Ro Khanna revealed the names of “six wealthy, powerful men” that the Department of Justice had redacted from the Epstein files “for no apparent reason.” Speaking on the House floor, the Democratic congressman named billionaire businessman and former Victoria’s Secret CEO Leslie Wexner, 88; Emirati businessman Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, 71; as well as Salvatore Nuara, Zurab Mikeladze, Leonic Leonov, and Nicola Caputo, as appearing in unredacted files related to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. “My question is, why did it take Thomas Massie and me going to the Justice Department to get these six men’s identities to become public?” Khanna asked representatives on Tuesday. He did not detail evidence of any wrongdoing against them.",

    "fullText": "Newly released documents detail convicted sex offender’s early backing of bitcoin and Coinbase\n\nMillions of files related to Jeffrey Epstein have brought to light his ties to the highest echelons of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nDocuments published last week by the US Department of Justice reveal Epstein bankrolled the “principal home and funding source” for bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, during its nascent stages; he also invested $3m in Coinbase in 2014, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, and cut a check that same year to Blockstream, a prominent bitcoin-focused technology firm. Both crypto startups accepted Epstein’s investments in 2014 – six years after his 2008 conviction in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a minor.\n\nDespite murmurings among crypto communities online about the need for a sector-level reckoning around the Epstein files’ revelations, most industry players predict few consequences for crypto companies or the sector writ large. Some see Epstein as a “skeptical investor” who pulled out of his crypto investments prematurely; others go so far as to claim Epstein was attempting to “undermine bitcoin”.\n\nThe crypto companies that secured Epstein’s investment have grown into multibillion-dollar giants, especially Coinbase, which went public on the Nasdaq in 2021, and whose co-founder, Brian Armstrong, has heavily influenced crypto regulation in the United States.\n\nEpstein’s 2014 investment in Coinbase was brokered by the crypto evangelist Brock Pierce, a former child actor and a co-founder of Tether, the world’s largest issuer of stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency whose value is typically pegged to a national currency.\n\nDocuments published by the justice department reveal Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of Coinbase who spearheaded its fundraise, liaised with Pierce about Epstein’s investment in the company and sought to meet with Epstein “if convenient”. Additional filings suggest Epstein sold half of his shares to Pierce’s firm, Blockchain Capital, for $15m in 2018.\n\nA spokeswoman for Coinbase declined to comment; Pierce did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nEpstein’s financing of bitcoin’s development stemmed from his role as a donor to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Over the course of 20 years, MIT accepted more than $800,000 from Epstein, who also facilitated more than $7m in donations from other wealthy individuals.\n\nIn communications from 2015 between Joichi Ito, then director of MIT’s Media Lab, a tech-focused research institute, and Epstein, Ito wrote that Epstein’s “gift funds” were used to “underwrite” the launch of the Digital Currency Initiative, an offshoot of the Lab tasked with researching and developing open-source crypto technologies; in the same email thread, Ito explained that the Lab’s role was to serve as the “principal home and funding source” for bitcoin. The Digital Currency Initiative did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn 2014, Ito brokered Epstein’s investment in Blockstream, which builds bitcoin-focused tech solutions. Epstein made a $500,000 early-stage investment in the company through an investment fund he co-owned with Ito. Email communications reveal Blockstream’s co-founders, Adam Back and Austin Hill, were invited by Epstein to meet in St Thomas, close to Little Saint James, the private island Epstein owned.\n\nOn Twitter, Back claimed that Blockstream understood Epstein to be a “limited partner in Ito’s fund”, which later divested from Blockstream “due to a potential conflict of interest, and other concerns” – meaning that “Blockstream has no direct nor indirect financial connection with Jeffrey Epstein, or his estate”.\n\nIn communications with an Italian investor, Epstein noted that he “like[d]” Back. Hill continued communicating with Epstein into 2017, checking in with his “friend” following a storm in the Caribbean. “Just checking that your Island is OK,” reads the email thread’s subject line. Representatives for Blockstream and Hill did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLuke Dashjr, an early contributor to bitcoin’s development as well as to Blockstream, has called for Adam Back to resign from his role as Blockstream’s CEO over ties to Epstein. In an interview with the Guardian, Dashjr said Epstein’s interest in bitcoin – namely, his “attempts to undermine” bitcoin’s network, early-stage companies, and developers – was a sign that “evil men often seek to destroy what is good”.\n\nCharlotte Fang, the founder of Remilia, which makes NFTs and other crypto-based art, said “only unserious people might care” about Epstein’s investment in bitcoin and Coinbase; in the latter case, “only the financially unsophisticated” would assume that he had “any degree of influence over the direction” of the exchange, as his seven-figure investment was a small part of Coinbase’s fundraise.\n\n“Bitcoin is a decentralized technology that required no funding, and Epstein was evidently a skeptical investor, who got in later than I did, and exited earlier than he should have,” Fang said.\n\n“Generally speaking, retail consumers will not change their habits” around crypto following this recent release of Epstein files, according to Kadan Stadelmann of Komodo, a crypto platform. Investor practices, including their dependence on connections to cut checks, will probably adhere to the status quo, he added. Some competitor crypto exchanges might see new customers who are leaving Coinbase following these new allegations, he hypothesized – as long as these exchanges didn’t take money from “similar unsavory sources”.\n\nAs to why Epstein was so interested in crypto, and in Coinbase specifically? “Epstein might have liked Coinbase’s IPO prospects,” he surmised.\n\nCryptocurrencies’ technological capabilities may have also played a role in Epstein’s interest in the sector, said Antulio Rosales, a professor at York University who studies crypto.\n\n“There’s his possibility of seeing markets without any ethical commitments, and without any pressures of social norms and of the law itself,” he said.",

    "description": "The files contained victim-identifying information and needed to be further redacted, DOJ officials said.",
    "fullText": "The Justice Department has removed thousands of files linked to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein from its website, it said in a court filing.\n\nIn a Thursday letter to judges in the Southern District of New York, DOJ officials said they had removed approximately 9,500 documents, in part because they originally included information that identified Epstein's victims.\n\nThe letter was signed by US Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, and US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Jay Clayton. It was filed in the court docket for the criminal cases against Epstein and his co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell. Victims' lawyers had asked judges to ensure the Justice Department would protect their privacy.\n\nThe Justice Department said in the letter that the takedowns were \"temporary\" while the documents were reviewed for additional redactions.\n\nIt added that in recent days, following the documents' release, victims of Epstein and their counsels had identified new names and identifiers for redaction \"that were not identified prior to publication.\"\n\n\"Additionally, many of the documents flagged by victims and victim counsel for further review were not necessarily identifying of a particular victim based on the face of the document, itself, and were not obviously sensitive in nature,\" the letter said.\n\nThe letter said these documents would be further redacted and then reposted. It requested the judges to \"not take any further protective measures\" while the department is reviewing the documents.\n\nThe DOJ's letter comes days after the Justice Department, on January 31, released 3 million Epstein-related files to the public. The latest tranche of files included big names from the tech and business spheres, such as Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and Reid Hoffman.\n\nIn the court filing, the Justice Department said the hiccups could be attributed to the sheer volume of records \"from multiple offices and investigations spanning over twenty years\" it needed to prepare for public release following the passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, as well as the \"technical capabilities of the document management systems\" and \"human error.\"\n\nA Justice Department spokesperson told Business Insider that it \"takes victim protection very seriously.\"\n\n\"The Department had 500 reviewers looking at millions of pages for this very reason, to meet the requirements of the act while protecting victims,\" the spokesperson said. \"When a victim's name is alleged to be unredacted, our team is working around the clock to fix the issue and republish appropriately redacted pages as soon as possible.\"",

    "fullText": "The Department of Justice released the latest batch of files pertaining to the crimes and communications of Jeffrey Epstein this past Friday afternoon, and while everyone was more than prepared to see the names of various celebrities and prominent political figures, almost no one was expecting to discover a direct tie between Epstein and the owner of the New England Patriots, Robert Kraft.\n\nAs Kraft’s team continues to prepare for their championship outing against the Seattle Seahawks at Super Bowl LX on February 8th, the 84-year-old American businessman finds himself in the midst of a potential legacy-shattering scandal, which allseems to stem from his 2019 misdemeanor charge for solicitation of prostitution.\n\nIn an email exchange between Epstein and Jack Goldberger, a notable criminal defense attorney, Goldberger wrote, “See, Kraft got arrested. Should take local news away from us.” Epstein responded by simply stating, “Yes. I’m trying to have him hire you.” The exchange is dated as February 22nd of 2019, and just six days later, on the 28th, ESPN reported that the Patriots’ owner had hired Goldberger as one of his attorneys.\n\nThe history between Epstein and Goldberger is that the defense attorney once helped the late s*x trafficker reach a non-prosecution deal with the Miami U.S. Attorney’s office in 2008 to end an investigation into Epstein’s sexual abuse of 40+ victims. In an unfortunate turn of events, however, this doesn’t appear to be the only instance in which Kraft seemingly followed the advice of Epstein.\n\nIn a separate text exchange, Goldeberger, who was saved in Epstein’s phone as “Jack,” informed Epstein about the ongoing formation of Kraft’s legal team.\n\n“Many people advising him, but after call, he called back and said he wants me and my Quinn Emanuel guy to handle it. The other guy trying to weasel in was Dan Conley. Don’t know anything about him, but having a Boston guy come down and trying to overpower these line assistants would be a huge mistake, and Kraft got it.”\n\nJust a few days later, in early March of 2019, it was reported by Yahoo Finance and Law.com that Kraft had brought on William “Bill” Burck, the co-managing partner in Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan’s Washington, D.C., office, to assist with his then-ongoing legal troubles. Although the real concern lies within Epstein’s response to Goldberger’s text, which simply stated, “You need to know about a past issue with Kraft that may come to light.”\n\nTo make matters even worse for the NFL, it turns out that Kraft wasn’t the only owner who was mentioned throughout the three million records that were released. The New York Giants’ Steve Tisch, the Carolina Panthers’ David Tepper, the Washington Commanders‘ Josh Harris, and several others were all mentioned in the latest release as well.\n\nWith their largest event of the year being just around the corner, it’s safe to say that this bombshell couldn’t have come at a worse time for the league, which will now have to spend its celebratory media week explaining away these various issues.\n\nThe post DOJ Files: Jeffrey Epstein Urged Patriots Owner Robert Kraft to Hire Jack Goldberger in 2019 Case appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "The chairman of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games has said he \"deeply regrets\" decades-old flirty emails with Ghislaine Maxwell - the jailed associate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nCasey Wasserman's messages to Maxwell, sent in 2003, were among millions of files published by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) on Friday.\n\nIn one exchange, Wasserman wrote to Maxwell: \"I think of you all the time... So what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?\"\n\nMaxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting and trafficking teenage girls to be sexually abused by the disgraced financier Epstein prior to his death in custody in 2019.\n\n\"I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light,\" Wasserman said in a statement obtained by news agency AFP.\n\nHe also emphasised that he had \"never had a personal or business relationship with Epstein\".\n\n\"As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane,\" Wasserman said.\n\n\"I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.\"\n\nWhile the files do not show any wrongdoing on the part of those featured, including Wasserman, they have raised renewed questions for those who associated with the influential financier.\n\nThe BBC has approached Wasserman for comment.\n\nWasserman founded a sports and entertainment agency in 2002, and is a trustee of the non-profit Clinton Foundation, according to the Olympics website.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell agreed last month to testify under oath before the congressional committee investigating the federal government's handling of the Epstein files.\n\nThe committee also summoned both former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to testify.\n\nThe former president appeared in photographs with Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nBill Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing by survivors of Epstein's abuse and has denied knowledge of his sex offending.\n\nEpstein, who was convicted of sexual offences in 2008, was found dead in his New York prison cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.",

    "description": "Among the latest Epstein files dump is a list of wild complaints made withe the FBI that include wild allegations against President Donald Trump and others.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump arrives for the premiere of first lady Melania Trump’s movie “Melania” at The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center For The Performing Arts, Thursday, Jan. 29, 2026, in Washington. \n\nAmong the latest Epstein files dump is a list of wild complaints made with the FBI that include wild allegations against President Donald Trump and others from uncorroborated tips.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced on Friday that thousands of new documents related to the case of convicted child sex predator Jeffrey Epstein were being released.\n\nThe latest drop comes as the administration has faced complaints from critics over its failure to release all the files by a December 19 deadline previously set by Congress.\n\nOn Friday, Blanche announced 3.5 million new files were being released to comply with the Epstein Transparency Act. Among them is a list of allegations made against the president, a former friend of Epstein’s. In FBI email communications — which note some of the allegations come secondhand — various allegations are listed that involve Trump, Epstein, and others.\n\nIt should be noted that these complaints are uncorroborated tips to the FBI, and the existence of those tips does not indicate eventual credibility.\n\nBlanche said the White House had no oversight on the latest documents released. He told Fox News that there has been no evidence of criminal conduct by the president found in the Epstein files.\n\n“In none of these communications, even when doing his best to disparage President Trump, did Epstein suggest President Trump had done anything criminal or had any inappropriate contact with any of his victims,” he said.\n\nTrump himself has long denied any wrongdoing in his friendship with Epstein.\n\nSince their original publication, the complaints mentioning Trump have been removed from the DOJ website with a “page not found” message being given to people trying to search for them. The complaints, however, have been widely copied and shared on social media.\n\nCNN’s Jake Tapper was among those who noted the DOJ pulling the files.\n\nDOJ has since killed this link. This is what was there: https://t.co/urnzMvyccO pic.twitter.com/qXXmQNYhu7\n\nTrump Accused of Raping Teenager\n\nIn a complaint made by a friend, the president was accused of forcing a 13-14-year-old to perform oral sex on him.\n\n“[Redacted] reported an unidentified female friend who was forced to perform oral sex on President Trump approximately 35 years ago in NJ. The friend told Alexis that she was approximately 13-14 years old when this occurred, and the friend allegedly bit President Trump while performing oral sex. The friend was allegedly hit in the face after she laughed about biting President Trump. The friend said she was also abused by Epstein,” the complaint reads.\n\nIn the “response” column, it is noted that an investigator was sent to Washington to conduct an interview.\n\nTrump Accused of Being Present While Newborn ‘Murdered’\n\nAnother in Epstein’s orbit also made allegations of “sex trafficking” and murder. The unidentified person was following up on a tip given to the NYPD in which the person alleged they were raped at 13. The person also alleged Trump regularly paid them to perform sexual acts and claimed he was present when her newborn child was murdered.\n\n“Complainant reported Donald Trump participated regularly in paying money to force her to perform sex acts with him and alleged Trump was present when her uncle murdered her newborn child,” notes on the complaint read.\n\nAccording to the paperwork, there was “no contact made.”\n\nMar-a-Lago ‘Calendar Girls’ Parties\n\nAnother complaint — for which there was no contact information provided — alleged that “calendar girls” parties at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago involved genital measurements for children.\n\n“Jeffrey Epstein would bring the children in and trump would auction them off. He measured the children’s vulva and vaginas by entering a finger and rated the children on tightness,” the complaint reads.\n\nThe person alleged people like Elon Musk, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump were present at these alleged parties.\n\nRobin Leach and Trump’s Head of Security\n\nOne complainant claimed they witnessed a “sex trafficking ring at the Trump Golf Course” in Rancho Palo Verdes, California between 1995 and 1996. The person alleged Ghislaine Maxwell, a former Epstein associate now serving 20 years for sex trafficking, was a “madam” and “broker” for deals involving girls.\n\nThe person claimed they witnessed Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous host Robin Leach “strangle a young girl” at a party. The person also alleged a threat from Trump’s head of security if she “ever talked.” She claimed she was told she would “end up as fertilizer for the back nine holes like the other c*nts” if she spoke about what she had seen.\n\nEpstein Gives Bill Gates Advice on Hiding Alleged STD From Wife\n\nAlso a part of the new file dump is a draft email Epstein was writing to himself in July 2013. In it, he addressed Bill Gates, accusing him of recently disregarding their “friendship.” In the lengthy message, he also made mention of Gates allegedly asking him to delete some past communications.\n\n“TO add insult to the injury you them (sic) implore me to please delete the emails regarding your std, your request that I provide you antibiotics that you can surreptitiously give to Melinda and the description of your penis,” he wrote.\n\nCheck out the Epstein files released so far here.\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect the latest changes to the available Epstein files.\n\nThe post DOJ Removes New Epstein Files That Mention Wild Trump Sex Allegations, Including Rape first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the DOJ will withhold or redact about 200,000 pages that it has deemed protected by \"various privileges.\"",
    "fullText": "After sifting through \"two Eiffel Towers' worth\" of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the Justice Department has concluded that some 200,000 documents will be at least partially withheld from the public, it said in a letter to Congress on Friday.\n\nThe disclosure came as Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced at a press conference that the DOJ would be concluding its Epstein data dump with the release of another 3 million files related to the well-connected financier who killed himself in jail while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in 2019.\n\nThree new tranches of files were published on the DOJ's website on Friday morning. Blanche said they would include 2,000 videos and 180,000 images, and that additional files would be posted on the site throughout the day.\n\nIn total, some 3.5 million files will be made public in compliance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which was passed into law in November and requires the Justice Department to publish its Epstein-related files.\n\nThe Justice Department will also withhold or redact about 200,000 pages that it says are protected by \"various privileges,\" including attorney-client, \"deliberative process,\" and \"work product\" privileges.\n\nBlanche, at the press conference Friday morning, said the Epstein files didn't contain information that would justify charges against any additional men for abusing women.\n\n\"There's this built-in assumption that somehow there's this hidden tranche of information about men, that we know about, that we're covering up or that we're choosing not to prosecute — that is not the case,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think the public and you all are going to uncover information about men who abuse women, unfortunately,\" he added.\n\nStill, victims and lawmakers are expected to be on the lookout for files that might reveal more about who else in Epstein's orbit may have been investigated, including prosecution memos, where prosecutors deliberate the strength of potential criminal charges.\n\nPreviously released files indicated that at least some Justice Department officials believed that other people associated with Epstein could be \"co-conspirators\" of his, although most of their names were redacted.\n\nSeveral emails included in an earlier disclosure referred to \"10 co-conspirators\" of Epstein who were served grand jury subpoenas.\n\nThe email exchange was partially redacted, but one email included the names of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 of trafficking girls to Epstein for sex and sentenced to 20 years in prison, and Jean-Luc Brunel, an associate of Epstein who killed himself in 2022 while awaiting trial in France on rape charges.\n\nIt also named Les Wexner, a billionaire who took financial advice from Epstein and later said he regretted his relationship with the financier. Wexner has not been charged with any crime and has said Epstein deceived him.\n\nA spokesperson for Wexner didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.\n\nThe names of other people in the email were redacted.\n\nMaxwell is the only other person the Justice Department has charged with participating in Epstein's sex-trafficking operation.\n\nBlanche said the Department would withhold \"anything that would jeopardize an active investigation,\" but did not say whether an ongoing investigation existed.\n\nIn November, Attorney General Pam Bondi said she asked Jay Clayton, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, to examine a request from President Donald Trump to investigate Epstein's ties to JPMorgan Chase, former President Bill Clinton, and several business leaders.\n\n\"Jay Clayton, in New York, is in charge of any potential investigations, and I'm not going to comment beyond that,\" Blanche said Friday.\n\nBlanche also said the Justice Department was not withholding any files for national security or foreign policy purposes, even though the Epstein Files Transparency Act allowed for it. And on Friday, the department asked a Manhattan judge to unseal material from the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, which represents numerous Epstein victims, that it had given to prosecutors after a grand jury subpoena.\n\nIn the letter to Congress, Bondi and Blanche write that it would provide members of the House and Senate judiciary committees with a report summarizing redactions and list \"all government officials and politically exposed persons named or referenced in the released materials.\"",

    "title": "Elon Musk discussed plans to party with Jeffrey Epstein on his Caribbean island, newly released emails show",
    "description": "Elon Musk planned visits to Jeffrey Epstein's island, DOJ emails show. Epstein repeatedly sought meetings with Musk, who previously denied visiting.",
    "fullText": "In November 2012, Jeffrey Epstein emailed Elon Musk about sending a helicopter to whisk the Tesla and SpaceX CEO to his private island in the Caribbean.\n\n\"how many people will you be for the heli to island,\" Epstein asked Musk in an email exchange, which was made public Friday by the Justice Department.\n\nMusk said he'd need just two seats — for himself and his then-partner, Tallulah Riley.\n\n\"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\" Musk asked.\n\nThe emails, released Friday, were part of a cache of 3 million files the Justice Department released from its yearslong investigation into the convicted sex offender. They include several exchanges between Epstein, Musk, and their assistants.\n\nIt's unclear whether Musk ever made the trip, and a representative didn't immediately return a request for comment.\n\nEpstein — who counted President Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and various other prominent politicians and businessmen among his acquaintances — killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. He had registered as a pedophile in 2008, after pleading guilty to less severe sex offenses.\n\nShortly after Epstein's arrest in July 2019, Musk said he had declined invitations to Epstein's island in the US Virgin Islands and recounted only one meeting with him. Musk has not been accused of wrongdoing.\n\n\"Several years ago, I was at his house in Manhattan for about 30 minutes in the middle of the afternoon with Talulah [Riley], as she was curious about meeting this strange person for a novel she was writing,\" he told Vanity Fair at the time. \"We did not see anything inappropriate at all, apart from weird art. He tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island. I declined.\"\n\nMusk has since said in social media posts that he \"refused\" to visit Epstein's island despite multiple attempts from Epstein.\n\nThe emails released Friday appear to show him planning to visit Epstein's island at least twice.\n\nIn addition to the November 2012 planned visit, Musk indicated he would visit Epstein's island in January 2014.\n\n\"Will be in the BVI/St Bart's area over the holidays,\" Musk wrote to Epstein in December 2013, referring to the British Virgin Islands. \"Is there a good time to visit?\"\n\nEpstein said he'd be available for the first week of January.\n\n\"always space for you,\" Epstein told Musk.\n\nAfter some back-and-forth about their schedules, Musk appeared to confirm that he would visit Epstein on January 2 of 2014.\n\n\"When should we head to your island on the 2nd?\" Musk wrote.\n\nThe emails show Epstein planning to meet Musk on other occasions as well.\n\nIn February of 2013, Musk's personal assistant tried to nail down plans for a meeting at SpaceX's offices in California. Epstein's assistant said Musk had suggested the location.\n\n\"Shall we organize a lunch for Elon and Jeffrey to get together at SpaceX in the coming weeks?\" Musk's assistant wrote. \"Elon is generally available at SpaceX on Mon, Thurs and Fri each week.\"\n\nIt isn't clear from the emails reviewed by Business Insider if that meeting took place. Musk has previously said that Epstein never \"toured\" SpaceX's facilities.\n\nIn early March of that year, Epstein directly asked Musk about his availability.\n\n\"now its time for fun,\" Epstein told Musk.\n\nIn the emails, Musk told Epstein he was busy with work at Tesla and SpaceX. Epstein suggested he get more sleep.\n\n\"benefit analysis would probably show , tesla doing better with you getting more sleep,\" he said.\n\n\"Normally I would agree, as I have found that my total daily productivity is optimal at around 6 to 6.5 hours of sleep.\"\n\nThe two may have met later that spring. In another email exchange, dated April 2013, Epstein's assistant said he planned to meet Musk at the Milken Institute economic conference.\n\nThe Justice Department emails also show Epstein inquiring with Musk about Solar City, a solar electricity company that was later acquired by Tesla. Epstein said in September 2012 that he wanted to use its services for his properties in the US Virgin Islands and New Mexico.\n\n\"is there any one at Solar City that my guys can talk to about electriying the caribean island?\" Epstein asked. \"or the new mexico ranch\"",

    "fullText": "Luigi Mangione will not face the death penalty in the 2024 ambush shooting and murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, a federal judge ruled on Friday.\n\nIn a written order issued an hour before a scheduled hearing in her Manhattan courtroom, US District Judge Margaret M. Garnett dismissed the two death penalty-eligible counts against Mangione.\n\nInstead, Mangione will face two fatal stalking counts at a trial that could begin in October: crossing state lines to cause Thompson's death, and using the internet to plan and carry out the CEO's death.\n\nBoth charges carry a maximum possible punishment of life in prison without parole.\n\nIn her order, Garnett used the word \"absurdity\" to describe the \"legal infirmities\" of the two charges she dismissed.\n\nBoth charges had required proof of stalking as being, in itself, a crime of violence, a requirement she said prosecutors failed to demonstrate.\n\nDuring the months he allegedly planned the murder, Mangione failed to place the CEO \"in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily harm\" or cause him \"emotional distress,\" as required by the statute, she wrote.\n\nThompson was unaware of Mangione's actions prior to being shot from behind outside a Manhattan hotel on December 4, 2024, according to prosecutors' own account of the killing.\n\n\"The stalking offenses charged in counts one and two are not 'crimes of violence' as a matter of law, and counts three and four must be dismissed,\" she wrote.\n\nProsecutors said Friday that they have not decided if they will appeal the judge's ruling.\n\nUS Attorney Pam Bondi announced in April that prosecutors will seek the death penalty.\n\n\"Luigi Mangione's murder of Brian Thompson — an innocent man and father of two young children — was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America,\" Bondi wrote then.\n\n\"After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump's agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again.\"\n\nIn a separate ruling Friday morning, the judge said she would allow the jury to see the most serious evidence against Mangione: The contents of his backpack, which, upon his arrest, contained a gun and a journal linked to the killing.",

    "description": "A key GOP senator is vowing to oppose Warsh's nomination until the DOJ probe into Fed Chair Jerome Powell is resolved. Here's why that's a big deal.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has a Jerome Powell-sized problem with installing Kevin Warsh as the new Fed chair.\n\nA key Republican senator has vowed to oppose the confirmation of any nominee to be the next Federal Reserve chairman until the Department of Justice's probe into Powell, the current chair, is resolved.\n\nThat senator — Thom Tillis of North Carolina — happens to sit on the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, which considers Fed chair nominations. If all Democrats join Tillis in opposing Warsh's confirmation, Warsh's nomination will effectively be stuck in committee.\n\nIn a post on X on Friday, Tillis made clear that he has nothing against Warsh, who has otherwise been lauded as a strong pick by both Republicans and economists.\n\n\"Kevin Warsh is a qualified nominee with a deep understanding of monetary policy,\" Tillis wrote, later adding: \"Protecting the independence of the Federal Reserve from political interference or legal intimidation is non-negotiable.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Powell revealed that the DOJ issued grand jury subpoenas to the Federal Reserve related to recent renovations at the building.\n\nPowell called the probe an effort to exert pressure on the central bank's monetary policy, and central bankers from around the world have rallied to Powell's defense.\n\nTrump has said that he had no knowledge of the subpoenas before Powell made them public.\n\nIn a statement, White House spokesman Kush Desai said that Warsh is \"eminently qualified to serve\" as the next Fed chair and that the White House \"looks forward to working with the Senate to quickly confirm him and get the Federal Reserve back on track.\"\n\nTrump appeared unmoved by Tillis's opposition, telling reporters in the Oval Office later on Friday that it's \"too bad.\"\n\nHe also suggested that Warsh's confirmation may have to wait until Tillis is out of office. The North Carolina senator's term ends in January 2027.\n\n\"If he doesn't approve, we'll just have to wait until somebody comes in that will approve it,\" Trump said.\n\nUnder Senate rules, before the full chamber can vote on a nominee, it must be reported \"favorably\" by the committee with jurisdiction, which requires a majority vote.\n\nDemocrats are expected to broadly oppose Warsh's confirmation, with many raising concerns about the independence of the Fed.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the committee, said in a statement on Friday that \"no Republican purporting to care about Fed independence should agree to move forward with this nomination\" under the circumstances.\n\nIf Tillis and every Democrat vote against Warsh's nomination, that leads to a deadlocked 12-12 committee vote.\n\nIt would take 60 votes in the Senate to bypass that committee vote and bring his nomination to the floor — an unlikely prospect, given that it requires Democratic support.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune has acknowledged the predicament. According to POLITICO, when asked on Thursday whether Warsh could be confirmed without Tillis's support, Thune said: \"Uh, probably not.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Tillis opted not to seek reelection, making it far more difficult for Trump to exert pressure on him to change his mind.",

    "description": "The Federal Reserve will likely hold rates steady at its January meeting, even as Jerome Powell faces mounting pressure from Trump amid the DOJ probe.",
    "fullText": "The Federal Reserve will make its first rate decision of the year on Wednesday — and all eyes are on Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nThe central bank's leaders have a near-total chance of holding rates steady this week, according to market-based projections from CME FedWatch. After three cuts in 2025, the Fed has penciled in one rate cut for the new year. In the long run, these rate decisions will affect the job market, consumer prices, and corporate America.\n\nBut there's a shadow over January's Fed meeting: The Department of Justice recently launched a probe into Powell's handling of renovations to the central bank's buildings. The Trump administration alleges that the chair gave false testimony at a June Congressional appearance, though Powell said the move should \"be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure\" on the Fed.\n\n\"This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,\" he said in a video statement released January 11.\n\nFed decisions impact mortgage and credit card rates, auto loans, inflation, and labor market churn over time. A slow but not catastrophically weak job market, combined with higher-than-ideal but relatively tame inflation, will probably mean a pause in rate cuts for now.\n\n\"There's little chance the Fed will vote to cut rates this week, as the data in-hand doesn't justify it,\" said NerdWallet's senior economist Elizabeth Renter, adding, \"The Fed's monetary policy job is a balancing act and their decision to keep rates as-is indicates the risks to either side of their dual mandate are relatively equal.\"\n\nThe central bank's dual mandate — to keep prices stable and the job market strong — has been tricky to balance lately. The US added fewer jobs than expected in December, the unemployment rate is hovering above 4%, and the inflation rate remained at 2.7%. If Fed leaders opt to hold rates steady rather than cut, it will be good news for inflation, at the risk of slowing down an already-sluggish jobs landscape.\n\nFor consumers, a hold means that interest rates for homes, cars, and credit cards would largely remain unchanged. The Fed also hopes to push inflation closer to its 2% goal. For job seekers, however, still-high borrowing costs could push companies toward layoffs or hiring freezes.\n\nThe Fed has made more headlines than usual this month. Powell announced grand jury subpoenas from the Trump administration through a video message posted online. And Governor Lisa Cook's case has reached the Supreme Court, following accusations of mortgage fraud from Trump.\n\nThe Powell probe has raised alarm about Fed independence with politicians, economists, and business leaders. North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis and other congressional leaders said they will now oppose all nominees to the Fed chair role from the Trump administration.\n\nWith Powell's term up in May, Trump is set to choose a successor as soon as this week. Frontrunners include Trump's economic advisor Kevin Hassett, Fed Governor Christopher Waller, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and Chief Investment Officer of global fixed income at BlackRock Rick Rieder.\n\nThe president has been vocal in his desire for lower interest rates and hopes the next Fed chair will consult with him more closely on policy decisions.\n\n\"The hope is that whoever takes Powell's role next will be similarly data driven and level headed,\" Renter said.",

(AP) — A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit against California that sought detailed voting records and personal data on its 23 million registered voters, concluding that the government's request was “unprecedented and illegal.”\n\nThe Trump administration's lawsuit, filed last year, contended that California and other states were illegally blocking the federal government's wide-ranging effort to scrutinize detailed voter data that states said was private and protected.\n\nThe administration “may not unilaterally usurp the authority over elections” U.S. District Judge David O. Carter in Santa Ana said in his 33-page decision.\n\nFurthermore, the attempt to gather and centralize the personal information would have a chilling effect on voter registration and threaten “the right to vote which is the cornerstone of American democracy,” the judge ruled.\n\n“There cannot be unbridled consolidation of all elections power in the executive (branch) without action from Congress,” Carter said. “This is antithetical to the promise of fair and free elections.”\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nIt has accused states of failing to respond sufficiently to questions about the procedures they take to maintain voter rolls. The department has sued 23 states, most of them controlled by Democrats, and the District of Columbia for detailed voter data that includes names, dates of birth, residential addresses, driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers.\n\nState election officials have questioned what the DOJ plans to do with that information. Last fall 10 Democratic secretaries of state wrote Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to express concern over reports that the DOJ was sharing state voter data with the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of DHS, operates a program that checks citizenship status.\n\nCalifornia Secretary of State Shirley Weber, the state's chief elections officer, said in a statement that California would “continue to challenge this administration’s disregard for the rule of law and our right to vote.”",

About four times a year, he emerges from meetings with Federal Reserve governors and regional bank presidents to hold press conferences on their analysis of jobs data, inflation reports, and subsequent interest rate projections (the infamous \"dot plot\").\n\nNot exactly typical fodder for going viral. But on Monday, after Powell released a video saying he'd been subpoenaed by the Justice Department as part of a pressure campaign, he started getting the meme treatment.\n\n\"I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy,\" Powell said in Sunday's two-minute video. \"But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"\n\nSocial media thought it was a banger.\n\nIn this house, Jerome Powell is a herohttps://t.co/VNfAnNCan3 pic.twitter.com/B6LRbKBD7D\n\nhttps://t.co/gHat9QbklK pic.twitter.com/IPxgoITbyx\n\nA post shared by Archegos Capital (@archegoscapital)\n\nYou know things are bad when the most boring person doing the most boring job for decades has to come out and say, “Stop trying to arrest us for doing math” https://t.co/3YCfPBFIae\n\nJerome Powell walking to the office this morning pic.twitter.com/wYibAekAmy\n\nMarco Rubio finding out he has to be chairman of the Federal Reserve pic.twitter.com/Ajzro16AuS\n\nWE ARE JEROME POWELL! pic.twitter.com/faTyYRcXLa\n\nNo the Resistance is fine, I just didn’t realize it would be lead by Jerome Powell https://t.co/JJvzkmylOo\n\nPresident Donald Trump has called on Powell, whose term doesn't end until May 2026, to lower interest rates more quickly.

    "fullText": "The \"sell America\" trade is seeing a revival on Monday.\n\nInvestors were reacting to developments over the weekend, including a proposal to cap credit card interest rates and the Department of Justice's criminal investigation of Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nMajor indexes were down in early morning trading, with the Dow dropping more than 400 points as investors took in the news.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Monday:\n\nThe Justice Department's probe relates to the Fed Chair's testimony last year about the renovation of the Fed's office buildings, a project Trump has criticized for its cost.\n\nTrump, who said he has decided on his pick to replace Powell when the Fed Chair's term ends his May, said he had no knowledge of the probe when speaking to NBC Sunday evening.\n\n\"I don't know anything about it, but he's certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings,\" he said.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe market has a complicated reaction to situations when it appears that Trump is applying pressure on Powell. The president has demanded that the Fed chief lower interest rates for years, including in his first term. The concern is that if rates are lowered prematurely, it could backfire and cause inflation to flare up again, which would force the central bank to turn hawkish and potentially hike rates down the road.\n\nThe knee-jerk reaction among investors is something markets have seen before.\n\n\"All these moves suggest a possible return of the 'sell America' trade,\" Paul Hickey, the co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, wrote in a note on Monday, referring to the broad sell-off in US assets in 2025 as investors fretted over tariffs and the health of the economy.\n\n\"Investors rushed to cut their exposure to US assets,\" David Morrison, a senior market analyst at Trade Nation, wrote in a note, pointing to concerns about the Fed's independence. \"Investors were also rattled by the Fed Chair's robust response,\" he added, referring to the video statement from Powell released on Sunday.\n\nHere were the moves investors saw Monday morning.\n\nTreasury yields were up as US debt securities faced selling pressure. The benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield climbed two basis points.\n\n\"Treasury yields are higher, and the curve is steeper amid fresh attacks on the Federal Reserve's independence,\" John Canavan, a lead analyst at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note on Monday.\n\nInvestors have shed Treasurys in other times when the president has meddled with the Fed or threatened Powell. Yields spiked last April when Trump first said he could fire the Fed chair, with the president tempering his views following big bouts of selling in the Treasury market.\n\nGold, which acts as a hedge against inflation and a haven during bouts of geopolitical turmoil, soared to records, rising 2% and breaking through $4,600 for the first time on Monday.\n\nThe precious metal is up 4% from levels at the start of the year and just recorded its best-ever annual run since 1979, around the time inflation began to soar in the US.\n\nDemand for safe havens looks \"strong,\" particularly as investors continue to weigh tensions between the US and other countries, like Venezuela and Greenland, Trade Nation's Morrison said.\n\nOther metals that typically rally alongside gold, like silver and copper, were also up.\n\nThe US Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, declined 0.4% on Monday, a possible sign that investors are reducing their exposure to dollar assets due to concerns about the Fed's independence.\n\n\"The investigation into Mr Powell has raised concerns about the Fed's autonomy, an unfavourable backdrop for the greenback,\" Morrison said.\n\n\"The broader fear is that the move could continue to erode Fed autonomy, which may raise long-term inflation expectations and be bearish for the greenback,\" Enrique Diaz-Alvarez, the chief economist at Ebury, wrote in a note.\n\nThe financial sector was rocked after Trump proposed that credit card interest rates be capped at 10% for a one-year period in a post on Truth Social.\n\n\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration. AFFORDABILITY!\" Trump wrote on his social media platform.\n\n\"Trump's proposal to cap credit card rates at 10% for a year added another layer of uncertainty, particularly for banks,\" Morrison added.",

He described the move as a part of a broader effort to pressure the central bank on monetary policy.\n\nProminent economists and business leaders are reacting as the news hit markets at the start of the trading week. They weighed in on how the DOJ move affects the Fed's independence, a question also raised by Sen. Thom Tillis. On Sunday, the Republican said he would oppose nominees for the Fed.\n\n\"If there were any remaining doubt about whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,\" Tillis said in a statement.\n\nHere's what leaders in economics and business are saying:\n\nProminent economist Mohamed El-Erian called for Powell's resignation months ago to protect the Fed's independence amid the feud with Trump.\n\nOn Sunday, El-Erian wrote on X that the inquiry into Powell is damaging for the US central bank.\n\n\"For those of us who value the operational autonomy of central banks, the risk is that this situation could expose deeper issues — further undermining the credibility of a Fed whose public standing is already fragile,\" wrote El-Erian, who is a former co-chief investment officer at Pimco.\n\nLinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman raised concerns about the Fed's independence.\n\n\"Question to all those who said Trump would be better for the economy: is attacking the Fed's independence what you had in mind?\" wrote the prominent Democratic donor on X.\n\nPeter Schiff, the chief economist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, attributed the gold price surge to fresh record highs on Sunday evening to the investigation into Powell.\n\n\"I am not a fan of Powell, but I agree with him on Trump's motivation,\" Schiff, whose firm managed $1.4 billion last year, wrote on X.\n\nIn April, Schiff said Trump's next Fed Chair pick would be a \"loyal soldier.\"\n\nMichael A. Gayed, a renowned investment manager, said direct action against a sitting Fed Chair is \"without modern precedent,\" in an edition of his Lead-Lag substack report published on Sunday evening.\n\nThe inquiry into Powell raises questions about whether the long-standing boundaries between fiscal power, prosecutorial authority, and monetary independence are beginning to blur, Gayed said. The concern was less about any single case and more about the future precedent it may establish.\n\n\"Should investors conclude that future Fed officials could face legal consequences for policy decisions that conflict with political priorities, the incentive structure governing monetary policy could change,\" said Gayed.\n\nThat shift could increase inflation risk premiums and weaken confidence in long-duration financial assets tied to stable policy expectations, he added.",

The Fed chair said the subpoenas were the latest move in the Trump administration's pressure campaign on the central bank to lower interest rates.\n\n\"No one — certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve — is above the law,\" Powell said. \"But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.\"\n\nPowell also suggested that this latest threat won't lead to his departure from his position, which President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for. Powell said he would continue to do his job.\n\nThe dollar and US stock futures fell on concerns about the Fed's independence on Sunday. Gold, seen as a haven investment, rose as much as 2%.\n\nFollowing Powell's statement, Trump denied having any knowledge of the Justice Department's investigation into the central bank.\n\n\"I don't know anything about it, but he's certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings,\" Trump said of Powell in an interview with NBC News Sunday night.\n\nThe $2.5 billion planned headquarters renovations have become a major talking point for White House officials, who have accused Powell of overspending and breaking oversight laws.\n\nIn July, Trump said that Powell's actions were \"sort of\" grounds for dismissal but later said he was \"highly unlikely\" to fire Powell, unless it was for \"fraud.\" Powell has defended the renovations.\n\nTrump has urged the Federal Reserve — an independent government agency — to lower interest rates as part of his plan to spur the American economy.\n\nIn its December meeting, the Fed cut rates to a range of 3.5%—3.75%, following similar reductions in September and October. After the meeting, Trump called Fed Chair Jerome Powell \"a stiff\" who approved a \"rather small\" cut and said the cut could have been \"at least doubled.\"\n\nThe president has also targeted Lisa Cook, a Fed governor. In August, he asked her to resign immediately due to allegations that Cook had committed illicit activity related to two mortgage loans. In September, a federal judge ruled that Cook can keep her job at the central bank for now.\n\nThe DOJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

    "fullText": "US stock futures dropped Sunday night as Wall Street reacted to the Trump administration opening a criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) and futures on the S&P 500 (ES=F) fell 0.5%. Contracts tied to the Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) slumped 0.8%.\n\nInvestors were rattled late Sunday evening after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell released a statement revealing that the Department of Justice had subpoenaed the US central bank.\n\nIn an uncharacteristic video address, Powell stated \"the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June.\"\n\nPowell claimed that the move was a direct attack for the setting of interest rates that \"serve the public\" rather than \"following the preferences of the President.\"\n\nThe tumultuous start follows a strong finish to last week, when stocks climbed to fresh record highs. Both the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Dow (^DJI) closed Friday at new peaks, extending a rally that pushed the S&P 500 up more than 1% for the week. The Dow and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) posted even stronger gains, rising 2.3% and 1.9%, respectively.\n\nThe significant escalation in Trump’s feud with the Fed chair comes as markets are bracing for the latest consumer inflation report, due Tuesday. The release comes on the heels of Friday’s December jobs report, which showed continued cooling in the labor market without signaling a sharp economic slowdown.\n\nTaken together, the data has reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will remain on hold for now, with CME FedWatch offering a 95% probability of rates staying the same.\n\nBeyond the economic calendar, geopolitical developments remain a wildcard. President Trump is reportedly weighing potential action involving Iran, while also escalating pressure on Cuba over Venezuelan oil shipments. Late last week, Trump also renewed controversial comments about Greenland, saying the US could pursue control of the Danish territory “whether they like it or not.”\n\nInvestors are now turning their attention to the first major catalysts of 2026: earnings season and key inflation data. Several of Wall Street’s biggest banks are set to report in the coming days, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS).\n\nVISHNU VARATHAN, HEAD OF ⁠MACRO RESEARCH, ASIA EX-JAPAN, ‌MIZUHO, SINGAPORE\n\n\"The Fed independence question is now well and alive and maybe subject to re-evaluation every few meetings.\n\n\"I think ‍I'm still not sure how sustained and adversarial the attack on the Fed might be. There could be a scenario where Trump could still appoint someone with ​some credibility and allow this person to run the show - so ‌that's probably why markets aren't panicking as yet.\"\n\nANDREW LILLEY, CHIEF RATES STRATEGIST AT BARRENJOEY, SYDNEY\n\n\"Trump is pulling at the loose threads of central bank independence. I don't even believe that he expects that Chair Powell will be charged... The only reason that he's taking these steps is that ⁠he knows that he's not going to ​take control of the Fed, so he ​wants to exert as much undue pressure as he can.\n\n\"It is not good. Don't get me wrong, but I think ‍it will amount to ⁠nothing. Investors won't be happy about it, but it shows actually Trump has no other levers to pull. The cash rate ⁠will stay what the majority of the FOMC wants them to be.\"",

    "description": "Jeffrey Epstein's wills named figures like Larry Summers and Jes Staley as possible executors, DOJ files show.",
    "fullText": "As he planned for his death, Jeffrey Epstein listed powerful friends and associates from Wall Street as the people who would take care of his affairs.\n\nVersions of Epstein's will released Tuesday by the Justice Department featured former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, former Barclays CEO Jes Staley, and former Bear Stearns CEO Jimmy Cayne as potential executors of his estate.\n\nThe final version of Epstein's will — which was signed in August of 2019, while he was in jail awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges in Manhattan, and shortly before he killed himself — listed his longtime personal lawyer, Darren Indyke, and accountant Richard Kahn as his estate executors.\n\nThe older versions of Epstein's will were released following the passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which required the Justice Department to make its Epstein-related files public. In addition to Epstein's 2019 indictment, his associate Ghislaine Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2021 for trafficking girls to him, and in 2008, he pleaded guilty to a crime involving sexual misconduct with a minor.\n\nThe files include references to many of Epstein's powerful associates, including President Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton. Inclusion in the documents isn't an indication of wrongdoing.\n\nCayne, who died in 2021, was listed as a co-executor for Epstein's estate in versions of Epstein's will signed in 2003 and 2004. Epstein worked at Bear Stearns in the 1980s, before becoming a financial advisor to billionaires Les Wexner and Leon Black.\n\nCayne's daughter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn 2012, Epstein listed Staley — who was then an executive at JPMorgan Chase — as a backup executor to his will. In 2013, Staley was promoted to co-executor status, alongside Indyke.\n\nStaley kept the position as co-executor of Epstein's will in the 2014 version as well. By then, Epstein had listed Summers as a backup executor.\n\nAn attorney for Staley didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Staley said in a 2019 letter to a UK regulator that he did not have a close relationship with Epstein.\n\nStaley stepped down as the CEO of Barclays in 2021 following an investigation into his ties with Epstein from the British bank regulator, which banned him from working in the financial industry. A UK court earlier this year upheld Staley's ban, finding that he lied about having a \"purely professional\" relationship with Epstein.\n\nSummers stepped down from his teaching post at Harvard and from his board seat at OpenAI following the release of numerous emails between him and Epstein by the House Oversight Committee last month.\n\nSteven Goldberg, a spokesperson for Summers, said in a statement that the economist was not involved in Epstein's financial life.\n\n\"Mr. Summers had absolutely no knowledge that he was included in an early version of Epstein's will and had no involvement in his financial matters or the administration of his estate,\" Goldberg said in a statement to Business Insider.\n\nEpstein also included another prominent figure in the penultimate version of his will. A draft of the will, released by the House Oversight Committee earlier this year, listed top Goldman Sachs lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler as the backup estate executor.\n\nRuemmler, through JPMorgan, declined to comment when the will was released by the House Oversight Committee earlier this month.",

    "title": "Impeachable: Pam Bondi Defied Federal Law by Erasing Epstein Photos to Protect Trump",
    "description": "The DOJ removed already-public Epstein files in defiance of a disclosure statute, prompting bipartisan outrage and impeachment talk from the law’s authors.",
    "fullText": "(Evan Vucci/The Associated Press)\n\nThe Justice Department is now engaged in an open cover-up carried out in direct violation of federal law.\n\nOver the weekend, the department quietly removed 16 photographs from the Epstein files website it created to comply with a disclosure statute passed by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump. The removals came without notice or explanation. Among the deleted images was one of the few photographs that even indirectly featured Trump, a picture of a credenza drawer inside Jeffrey Epstein’s Manhattan home containing other photographs, including at least one of Trump. Twelve others depicted Epstein’s third-floor massage room, a central crime scene in the federal investigation. Some images of the same room remain public. Others disappeared.\n\nWhen Democrats on the House Oversight Committee asked whether the Trump-related image had been taken down, the Justice Department declined to respond.\n\nWhat followed made matters worse.\n\nIn a post on X quoting Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, the Justice Department claimed that “photos and other materials will continue being reviewed and redacted consistent with the law in an abundance of caution as we receive additional information.” Blanche’s original post asserted that the department had released Epstein materials “under the Epstein Files Transparency Act” and that additional disclosures would follow “as our review continues, consistent with the law and with protections for victims.”\n\nThat explanation fails under the statute the department invoked.\n\nCongress did not authorize a rolling review. The Epstein Files Transparency Act compels the Justice Department to release all Epstein-related materials in its possession. The law imposes a mandatory disclosure obligation and permits only limited redactions to protect victims. It grants no authority to retract, revise, or curate records after release. Once the department published those materials, the law required that they remain available to the public.\n\nRemoving them placed the department in direct conflict with the statute Congress enacted.\n\nThat conflict was immediately recognized. Blanche’s post received a community note stating that the law requires the release of all files and allows only narrow redactions to protect victims, adding that the department’s partial release and extensive redactions violated the statute. The Justice Department’s own post received a community note citing the statute directly and stating that retractions and redactions to protect politically exposed persons are not permitted. Community Notes appear only when users with differing political viewpoints agree on their accuracy, underscoring how broadly that conclusion was shared.\n\nThe department’s own explanation confirms it is violating the law it claims to follow.\n\nThe sequence exposes motive. The files went live. Political reaction followed. The department then altered the public record. Compliance held only until presidential exposure appeared, then gave way to erasure.\n\nIn November, I described the Trump Justice Department’s handling of the Epstein files as a cover-up. Last week, I wrote that the administration’s delay in disclosure created a political problem rather than an immediate legal one. That assessment reflected weak enforcement mechanisms and an approach built on delay rather than open defiance.\n\nRemoving already released material that implicates the president converts a credibility crisis into a statutory violation and a far larger political emergency. Congress passed the Epstein disclosure statute precisely to eliminate executive discretion. Lawmakers acted because the Justice Department repeatedly demonstrated it could not be trusted to manage politically sensitive material involving powerful figures. The law mandated disclosure to prevent executive self-protection.\n\nThe department seized that discretion anyway.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi had lawful options. She could have sought judicial review. She could have consulted Congress. She could have acknowledged that the statute permits no removal authority and sought amendment. Each path would have preserved institutional legitimacy. She chose concealment and false justification instead.\n\nThis erasure differs from earlier Trump-era document fights in a crucial way. Prior disputes centered on whether materials must be disclosed. This episode involves evidence already released to the public under statutory standards. The department determined the images satisfied the law’s requirements, then removed them once the political cost became apparent.\n\nEvery disclosure statute now faces the same test: compliance survives only until it threatens the president. Months of delay, sweeping redactions, and staged releases already convinced much of the public that the Justice Department prioritized Trump’s standing over transparency, victims, and the public interest. The image removals confirm that conclusion decisively.\n\nA Justice Department that edits evidence to shield the president forfeits legitimacy. Oversight collapses when obedience ends at political inconvenience. The rule of law depends on statutes binding the executive even when compliance proves costly.\n\nCongress wrote a law to prevent exactly this abuse. The president signed it. The attorney general is now violating it to protect him. That meets any reasonable standard for impeachment.\n\nThe backlash on Capitol Hill was immediate and bipartisan. Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, who co-authored the Epstein Files Transparency Act, and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who forced the House vote compelling disclosure, both said the Justice Department failed to comply with the law. Khanna has confirmed that he and Massie are drafting impeachment and contempt measures against Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\nCongress now faces a choice. It can accept that disclosure laws apply only when politically painless. It can normalize the disappearance of already public evidence. It can allow executive power to override legislative command.\n\nOr it can enforce the law it wrote.\n\nThis is a cover-up enforced through executive defiance. The question now is whether Congress will enforce its own laws.\n\nThe post Impeachable: Pam Bondi Defied Federal Law by Erasing Epstein Photos to Protect Trump first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Angel Ureña, the deputy chief of staff to Bill Clinton, spoke out after his boss was featured prominently in Epstein files released by the Trump DOJ.",
    "fullText": "Angel Ureña, the deputy chief of staff to Bill Clinton, spoke out after his boss was featured prominently in Epstein files released by the Trump DOJ, accusing the current administration of trying to use the former president as a “scapegoat.”\n\n“The White House hasn’t been hiding these files for months only to dump them late on a Friday to protect Bill Clinton,” Ureña, who has worked for Clinton for several decades, said in statement on X. “This is about shielding themselves from what comes next, or from what they’ll try and hide forever. So they can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, this isn’t about Bill Clinton. Never has, never will be.”\n\nAs Ureña went on, he called out Trump chief of staff Susie Wiles, noting the latter said on the record that “Donald Trump was wrong about Bill Clinton” and his claim that the prominent Democrat visited Epstein’s infamous private island multiple times. (Wiles later clarified that there was “no evidence” proving Trump’s claims.)\n\n“There are two types of people here,” Clinton’s deputy chief of staff continued. “The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We’re in the first. No amount of stalling by people in the second group will change that.”\n\nPer Ureña, “everyone, especially MAGA, expects answers, not scapegoats.”\n\nRepresentative for the White House and the DOJ did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment.\n\nThe federal government began releasing files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, a month after President Trump ordered their release following a bipartisan push in Congress. As journalists began to comb through the files, photos of Clinton and Michael Jackson surfaced — though, large chunks of the files had also been redacted.\n\nMany have criticized the DOJ over the release, with many noting the Epstein Files Transparency Act meant the government was meant to hand over all of the documents Friday.\n\nThough, the White House has sung a different tune over the files drop. White House spokesperson Abigail Johnson said in a statement that “the Trump Administration is the most transparent in history.”\n\n“By releasing thousands of pages of documents, cooperating with the House Oversight Committee’s subpoena request, and President Trump recently calling for further investigations into Epstein’s Democrat friends, the Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have,” she said.\n\nThe post Bill Clinton’s Deputy Chief of Staff Hits Back at Trump Administration Over Epstein Files Drop: ‘They’ll Try and Hide Forever’ appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "The Justice Department has officially released documents on Jeffrey Epstein, the well-connected financier who killed himself in jail while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in 2019.\n\nFriday's disclosure is the first of what are expected to be several rounds of document releases over the coming weeks as the DOJ scrambles to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law in November.\n\nThe documents contain a trove of photos, some of which feature famous names such as former President Bill Clinton, Michael Jackson, and singer Diana Ross.\n\nWhile a past relationship with Epstein is no indication of wrongdoing, his victims and other members of the public have pushed for the disclosure in hopes that the DOJ's records might shed light on those connections and law enforcement's handling of the case.\n\nSo what else do the latest Epstein files contain? Business Insider reporters have begun looking through the documents and photos and we'll be reporting out highlights as they're discovered.\n\nA bipartisan duo of House lawmakers responsible for pushing the Epstein files bill through Congress is displeased with the Justice Department's release of documents thus far and publicly proposing remedies.\n\n\"Unfortunately, today's document release by @AGPamBondi and @DAGToddBlanche grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law that @realDonaldTrump signed just 30 days ago,\" Rep.

Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, said it was unacceptable that many documents remain redacted, despite the law allowing only narrow exceptions and requiring explanations for such redactions. He threatened the possibility of impeachment if Justice Department officials do not comply, though such action would require at least some Republican support.\n\n\"Thomas Massie and I are exploring all options,\" Khanna said in a video posted on X. \"It can be the impeachment of people at Justice, inherent contempt, or referring for prosecution those who are obstructing justice.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, Epstein's longtime friend and sex trafficking accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, features heavily in the files dropped on Friday. The files include photos of them traveling together and her dressed up in a uniform.\n\nThe daughter of a British media Tycoon, Maxwell was a constant presence in Epstein's life over the decades. The two were even romantically involved at one point.\n\nMaxwell is serving a 20-year sentence at a minimum-security federal prison in Texas for her role in Epstein's sex trafficking operation.Read full story\n\nSome redactions to the files are drawing ire online.\n\n\"Breaking News: The Epstein Files,\" wrote Julie K.

Spacey himself has faced sexual misconduct allegations, but has been cleared of charges in jury trials in New York and London.\n\nRepresentatives for Spacey and Clinton did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe DOJ has been investigating Epstein for the better part of two decades, starting around 2006 after local police in Palm Beach, Florida, began looking into complaints that he was luring young girls to his mansion by promising them money for massages.\n\nIt's no wonder then that the agency has so much data that Friday's drop — despite being a partial release —was broken into four parts.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton, pop star Michael Jackson, and singer Diana Ross are among the wealthy and powerful individuals included in the thousands of images released by the Justice Department.\n\nBeing featured in the photographs released, or having a tie to Epstein, is not an indication of wrongdoing, and it's unclear what the context of some of the photos might be.

There are also many, many photos.\n\nA note on the homepage indicates that, should additional responsive documents be identified in accordance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, they will be added to the archive.\n\nIncluded among the photos were images of former President Bill Clinton, Mick Jagger, and Michael Jackson at gatherings with Epstein. One collection of photos included a series of nude photographs, redacted so as not to be explicit.\n\nOther images appear to be from Epstein's Manhattan home, including photos of his bedroom, risque wall art, what appeared to be an effigy hanging from the staircase, and a taxidermied tiger.\n\n\"The Trump Administration is the most transparent in history.

He said to expect \"several hundred thousand documents today,\" including photos, and the rest \"over the next couple of weeks.\"\n\nIn speaking to Fox News on Friday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said to expect at least some photos in Friday's batch of documents.\n\n\"I expect that we're going to release several hundred thousand documents today, and those documents will come in all different forms — photographs and other materials associated with the investigation into Mr. Epstein,\" Blanche said.\n\nIn speaking to Fox News on Friday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said to expect at least some photos in Friday's batch of documents.\n\n\"I expect that we're going to release several hundred thousand documents today, and those documents will come in all different forms — photographs and other materials associated with the investigation into Mr. Epstein,\" Blanche said.\n\nIn recent weeks, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have released new photos they obtained through subpoenas of Epstein's estate. We've seen titans of industry like Richard Branson, Bill Gates, and Sergey Brin.\n\nSchiff responded to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who told Fox News on Friday morning that the DOJ would \"release several hundred thousand documents today,\" but would fall short of releasing all files.\n\n\"The Epstein Files Transparency Act is clear: while protecting survivors, ALL of these records are required to be released today,\" Schiff wrote on Bluesky. \"Not just some.\"\n\nSchiff responded to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who told Fox News on Friday morning that the DOJ would \"release several hundred thousand documents today,\" but would fall short of releasing all files.\n\n\"The Epstein Files Transparency Act is clear: while protecting survivors, ALL of these records are required to be released today,\" Schiff wrote on Bluesky. \"Not just some.\"\n\n\"The Trump administration can't move the goalposts. They're cemented in law,\" Schiff added.\n\nThe Epstein Files Transparency Act, signed into law on November 19, states that the documents can be released no \"later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\" According to the law, the attorney general needs to \"make publicly available in a searchable and downloadable format all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in the possession of the Department of Justice.\"\n\nIn 2019, ahead of Epstein's arrest and suicide, Steve Bannon filmed what he said were 15 hours of interviews with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThat footage has remained under wraps. If the footage was on Epstein's hard drives, however, the DOJ might have obtained it when the FBI seized his electronic devices around the time of his arrest on sex-trafficking charges.\n\nRecently released text messages between Epstein and Bannon have shed some light on the project, which was intended to be a promotional documentary to burnish Epstein's reputation.\n\nRead that story here:Read full story\n\nJustice Department officials told multiple news outlets earlier today that the files will be released at 3 p.m. ET.\n\nThe DOJ has now missed that deadline. By law, it has until midnight tonight to release all of its files related to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nJustice Department officials told multiple news outlets earlier today that the files will be released at 3 p.m. ET.\n\nThe DOJ has now missed that deadline. By law, it has until midnight tonight to release all of its files related to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nWhile the specifics of what will be in the files released on Friday aren't clear, here is some of what is anticipated:\n\nThe Justice Department is pushing back on criticism that it is not meeting the statutory deadline, characterizing it as an \"initial deadline\" — though the law does not call it that.\n\n\"The Trump administration is providing levels of transparency that prior administrations never even contemplated,\" the Justice Department's office of public affairs wrote on X. \"The initial deadline is being met as we work diligently to protect victims.\"\n\nThe Justice Department is pushing back on criticism that it is not meeting the statutory deadline, characterizing it as an \"initial deadline\" — though the law does not call it that.\n\n\"The Trump administration is providing levels of transparency that prior administrations never even contemplated,\" the Justice Department's office of public affairs wrote on X. \"The initial deadline is being met as we work diligently to protect victims.\"\n\nThe White House initially opposed the transparency law until enough Republican lawmakers broke with GOP leadership to join House Democrats, forcing a vote on the bill. After it became clear Congress would move ahead anyway, Trump flipped his stance on the legislation.\n\nDuring Epstein's 2019 arrest, the FBI searched his Manhattan townhouse and his home in the US Virgin Islands. In the process, they obtained more than 70 computers, iPads, and hard drives, along with financial documents and binders full of CDs.\n\nThose seized materials form the heart of the \"Epstein files,\" which could shed even more light on the deepest, darkest secrets of the notorious pedophile.\n\nThose could include more emails and text messages, as well as internal prosecutorial records. The Justice Department has overseen two different criminal investigations into Epstein's sexual abuse of teenage girls. The first took place in Florida and led to a widely criticized plea deal in 2008. The second was the Manhattan-based investigation, which led to Epstein's 2019 arrest and Maxwell's prosecution.\n\n\"We are now examining all legal options in the face of this violation of federal law,\" Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Robert Garcia of California said in a joint statement. \"The survivors of this nightmare deserve justice, the co-conspirators must be held accountable, and the American people deserve complete transparency from DOJ.\"\n\nRaskin and Garcia serve as the top Democrats on the powerful House Judiciary Committee and the Oversight Committee, respectively. Since Democrats control neither chamber of Congress, their power to force the immediate disclosure of the documents is more limited.\n\nEarlier today, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the Justice Department would not meet the legal deadline imposed by bipartisan legislation that President Donald Trump signed into law in November that requires the DOJ to release \"all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" regarding Epstein and his conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\n\"I expect that we're going to release more documents over the next couple of weeks, so today several hundred thousand and then over the next couple weeks, I expect several hundred thousand more,\" Blanche said during an interview on Fox News.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell, Epstein's co-conspirator, was found guilty of sex trafficking and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Civil lawsuits involving Epstein, Maxwell, banks affiliated with Epstein, and the US Virgin Islands government have shaken loose even more details about his life. Various drips and drabs have also entered the public domain through Freedom of Information Act requests, government reports, and an inquiry from the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nAll of that may pale in comparison to what the Justice Department has in its possession.\n\nYes. In recent months, the House Oversight Committee has made public Epstein-related documents it obtained through subpoenas, including emails provided by his estate and never-before-seen photos of some of Epstein's powerful acquaintances, including Trump, Bill Gates, Larry Summers, and Steve Bannon.\n\nThose disclosures have already led to some fallout. Summers, a former Treasury Secretary, has been barred from the American Economic Association for life and is no longer teaching classes at Harvard University, pending an investigation.\n\nEpstein killed himself in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. He was known for rubbing elbows with powerful people — even after he was convicted of soliciting sex from a minor in 2008. Over the years, he has counted Trump, Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and other titans of finance, law, politics, and science among his acquaintances.\n\nWhile a past relationship with Epstein is no indication of wrongdoing, his victims and other members of the public have pushed for the disclosure in hopes that the DOJ's records might shed light on those relationships and law enforcement's handling of the case.",
