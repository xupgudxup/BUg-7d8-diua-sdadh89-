    "description": "The Justice Department released a tranche of its records on disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, a partial disclosure that will only serve to keep interest in — and questions about — the case stoked. The material included court records and evidence from the legal case against Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence on sex trafficking charges. Among the documents were a heavily redacted contact book a “masseuse list” that shows 254 entries, all of them blacked out. Some of the other documents had already been publicly disclosed, including more than 20,000 pages of documents released by the House Oversight Committee.

    "fullText": "The Justice Department has officially released documents on Jeffrey Epstein, the well-connected financier who killed himself in jail while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in 2019.\n\nFriday's disclosure is the first of what are expected to be several rounds of document releases over the coming weeks as the DOJ scrambles to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law in November.\n\nThe documents contain a trove of photos, some of which feature famous names such as former President Bill Clinton, Michael Jackson, and singer Diana Ross.\n\nWhile a past relationship with Epstein is no indication of wrongdoing, his victims and other members of the public have pushed for the disclosure in hopes that the DOJ's records might shed light on those connections and law enforcement's handling of the case.\n\nSo what else do the latest Epstein files contain? Business Insider reporters have begun looking through the documents and photos and we'll be reporting out highlights as they're discovered.\n\nA bipartisan duo of House lawmakers responsible for pushing the Epstein files bill through Congress is displeased with the Justice Department's release of documents thus far and publicly proposing remedies.\n\n\"Unfortunately, today's document release by @AGPamBondi and @DAGToddBlanche grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law that @realDonaldTrump signed just 30 days ago,\" Rep.

Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, said it was unacceptable that many documents remain redacted, despite the law allowing only narrow exceptions and requiring explanations for such redactions. He threatened the possibility of impeachment if Justice Department officials do not comply, though such action would require at least some Republican support.\n\n\"Thomas Massie and I are exploring all options,\" Khanna said in a video posted on X. \"It can be the impeachment of people at Justice, inherent contempt, or referring for prosecution those who are obstructing justice.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, Epstein's longtime friend and sex trafficking accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, features heavily in the files dropped on Friday. The files include photos of them traveling together and her dressed up in a uniform.\n\nThe daughter of a British media Tycoon, Maxwell was a constant presence in Epstein's life over the decades. The two were even romantically involved at one point.\n\nMaxwell is serving a 20-year sentence at a minimum-security federal prison in Texas for her role in Epstein's sex trafficking operation.Read full story\n\nSome redactions to the files are drawing ire online.\n\n\"Breaking News: The Epstein Files,\" wrote Julie K.

Spacey himself has faced sexual misconduct allegations, but has been cleared of charges in jury trials in New York and London.\n\nRepresentatives for Spacey and Clinton did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe DOJ has been investigating Epstein for the better part of two decades, starting around 2006 after local police in Palm Beach, Florida, began looking into complaints that he was luring young girls to his mansion by promising them money for massages.\n\nIt's no wonder then that the agency has so much data that Friday's drop — despite being a partial release —was broken into four parts.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton, pop star Michael Jackson, and singer Diana Ross are among the wealthy and powerful individuals included in the thousands of images released by the Justice Department.\n\nBeing featured in the photographs released, or having a tie to Epstein, is not an indication of wrongdoing, and it's unclear what the context of some of the photos might be. Clinton has long been connected to Epstein and took multiple trips on the disgraced financier's private plane.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton, pop star Michael Jackson, and singer Diana Ross are among the wealthy and powerful individuals included in the thousands of images released by the Justice Department.\n\nBeing featured in the photographs released, or having a tie to Epstein, is not an indication of wrongdoing, and it's unclear what the context of some of the photos might be.

Others are duplicates of previously released records. There are also many, many photos.\n\nA note on the homepage indicates that, should additional responsive documents be identified in accordance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, they will be added to the archive.\n\nIncluded among the photos were images of former President Bill Clinton, Mick Jagger, and Michael Jackson at gatherings with Epstein. One collection of photos included a series of nude photographs, redacted so as not to be explicit.\n\nOther images appear to be from Epstein's Manhattan home, including photos of his bedroom, risque wall art, what appeared to be an effigy hanging from the staircase, and a taxidermied tiger.\n\n\"The Trump Administration is the most transparent in history. By releasing thousands of pages of documents, cooperating with the House Oversight Committee's subpoena request, and President Trump recently calling for further investigations into Epstein's Democrat friends, the Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have. And while President Trump is delivering on his promises, Democrats like Hakeem Jeffries and Stacey Plaskett have yet to explain why they were soliciting money and meetings from Epstein after he was a convicted sex offender. The American people deserve answers.\" Abigail Jackson WH spokeswoman\n\nThe DOJ added several warning notices about its Epstein documents. One advised that \"certain portions of this library may not be appropriate for all readers\" due to their descriptions of sexual assault.\n\nAnother warned that some people's personal information could be shared, and suggested that it was the fault of the legislation.\n\nThe DOJ added several warning notices about its Epstein documents.

He said to expect \"several hundred thousand documents today,\" including photos, and the rest \"over the next couple of weeks.\"\n\nIn speaking to Fox News on Friday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said to expect at least some photos in Friday's batch of documents.\n\n\"I expect that we're going to release several hundred thousand documents today, and those documents will come in all different forms — photographs and other materials associated with the investigation into Mr. Epstein,\" Blanche said.\n\nIn speaking to Fox News on Friday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said to expect at least some photos in Friday's batch of documents.\n\n\"I expect that we're going to release several hundred thousand documents today, and those documents will come in all different forms — photographs and other materials associated with the investigation into Mr. Epstein,\" Blanche said.\n\nIn recent weeks, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have released new photos they obtained through subpoenas of Epstein's estate. We've seen titans of industry like Richard Branson, Bill Gates, and Sergey Brin.\n\nSchiff responded to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who told Fox News on Friday morning that the DOJ would \"release several hundred thousand documents today,\" but would fall short of releasing all files.\n\n\"The Epstein Files Transparency Act is clear: while protecting survivors, ALL of these records are required to be released today,\" Schiff wrote on Bluesky. \"Not just some.\"\n\nSchiff responded to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who told Fox News on Friday morning that the DOJ would \"release several hundred thousand documents today,\" but would fall short of releasing all files.\n\n\"The Epstein Files Transparency Act is clear: while protecting survivors, ALL of these records are required to be released today,\" Schiff wrote on Bluesky. \"Not just some.\"\n\n\"The Trump administration can't move the goalposts. They're cemented in law,\" Schiff added.\n\nThe Epstein Files Transparency Act, signed into law on November 19, states that the documents can be released no \"later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\" According to the law, the attorney general needs to \"make publicly available in a searchable and downloadable format all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in the possession of the Department of Justice.\"\n\nIn 2019, ahead of Epstein's arrest and suicide, Steve Bannon filmed what he said were 15 hours of interviews with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThat footage has remained under wraps. If the footage was on Epstein's hard drives, however, the DOJ might have obtained it when the FBI seized his electronic devices around the time of his arrest on sex-trafficking charges.\n\nRecently released text messages between Epstein and Bannon have shed some light on the project, which was intended to be a promotional documentary to burnish Epstein's reputation.\n\nRead that story here:Read full story\n\nJustice Department officials told multiple news outlets earlier today that the files will be released at 3 p.m. ET.\n\nThe DOJ has now missed that deadline. By law, it has until midnight tonight to release all of its files related to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nJustice Department officials told multiple news outlets earlier today that the files will be released at 3 p.m. ET.\n\nThe DOJ has now missed that deadline. By law, it has until midnight tonight to release all of its files related to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nWhile the specifics of what will be in the files released on Friday aren't clear, here is some of what is anticipated:\n\nThe Justice Department is pushing back on criticism that it is not meeting the statutory deadline, characterizing it as an \"initial deadline\" — though the law does not call it that.\n\n\"The Trump administration is providing levels of transparency that prior administrations never even contemplated,\" the Justice Department's office of public affairs wrote on X. \"The initial deadline is being met as we work diligently to protect victims.\"\n\nThe Justice Department is pushing back on criticism that it is not meeting the statutory deadline, characterizing it as an \"initial deadline\" — though the law does not call it that.\n\n\"The Trump administration is providing levels of transparency that prior administrations never even contemplated,\" the Justice Department's office of public affairs wrote on X. \"The initial deadline is being met as we work diligently to protect victims.\"\n\nThe White House initially opposed the transparency law until enough Republican lawmakers broke with GOP leadership to join House Democrats, forcing a vote on the bill. After it became clear Congress would move ahead anyway, Trump flipped his stance on the legislation.\n\nDuring Epstein's 2019 arrest, the FBI searched his Manhattan townhouse and his home in the US Virgin Islands. In the process, they obtained more than 70 computers, iPads, and hard drives, along with financial documents and binders full of CDs.\n\nThose seized materials form the heart of the \"Epstein files,\" which could shed even more light on the deepest, darkest secrets of the notorious pedophile.\n\nThose could include more emails and text messages, as well as internal prosecutorial records. The Justice Department has overseen two different criminal investigations into Epstein's sexual abuse of teenage girls. The first took place in Florida and led to a widely criticized plea deal in 2008. The second was the Manhattan-based investigation, which led to Epstein's 2019 arrest and Maxwell's prosecution.\n\n\"We are now examining all legal options in the face of this violation of federal law,\" Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Robert Garcia of California said in a joint statement. \"The survivors of this nightmare deserve justice, the co-conspirators must be held accountable, and the American people deserve complete transparency from DOJ.\"\n\nRaskin and Garcia serve as the top Democrats on the powerful House Judiciary Committee and the Oversight Committee, respectively. Since Democrats control neither chamber of Congress, their power to force the immediate disclosure of the documents is more limited.\n\nEarlier today, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the Justice Department would not meet the legal deadline imposed by bipartisan legislation that President Donald Trump signed into law in November that requires the DOJ to release \"all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" regarding Epstein and his conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\n\"I expect that we're going to release more documents over the next couple of weeks, so today several hundred thousand and then over the next couple weeks, I expect several hundred thousand more,\" Blanche said during an interview on Fox News.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell, Epstein's co-conspirator, was found guilty of sex trafficking and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Civil lawsuits involving Epstein, Maxwell, banks affiliated with Epstein, and the US Virgin Islands government have shaken loose even more details about his life. Various drips and drabs have also entered the public domain through Freedom of Information Act requests, government reports, and an inquiry from the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nAll of that may pale in comparison to what the Justice Department has in its possession.\n\nYes. In recent months, the House Oversight Committee has made public Epstein-related documents it obtained through subpoenas, including emails provided by his estate and never-before-seen photos of some of Epstein's powerful acquaintances, including Trump, Bill Gates, Larry Summers, and Steve Bannon.\n\nThose disclosures have already led to some fallout. Summers, a former Treasury Secretary, has been barred from the American Economic Association for life and is no longer teaching classes at Harvard University, pending an investigation.\n\nEpstein killed himself in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. He was known for rubbing elbows with powerful people — even after he was convicted of soliciting sex from a minor in 2008. Over the years, he has counted Trump, Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and other titans of finance, law, politics, and science among his acquaintances.\n\nWhile a past relationship with Epstein is no indication of wrongdoing, his victims and other members of the public have pushed for the disclosure in hopes that the DOJ's records might shed light on those relationships and law enforcement's handling of the case.",
