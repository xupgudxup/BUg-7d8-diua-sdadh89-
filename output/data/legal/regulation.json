    "description": ": Watchdogs warn models that can generate realistic images of people must comply with data protection laws",
    "fullText": "A global coalition of privacy watchdogs has fired a warning shot at the generative AI industry, saying companies churning out realistic synthetic images can't pretend that data protection rules don't apply.\n\nThe joint statement [PDF] signed by more than 60 regulators, including the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC), boils down to a simple point: if your model can convincingly fake a person, you don't get to pretend data protection law doesn't exist.\n\n\"Recent developments – particularly AI image and video generation integrated into widely accessible social media platforms – have enabled the creation of non-consensual intimate imagery, defamatory depictions, and other harmful content featuring real individuals,\" said the signatories. \"We are especially concerned about potential harms to children and other vulnerable groups, such as cyberbullying and/or exploitation.\"\n\nThe warning lands weeks after the ICO and DPC opened formal probes into Elon Musk's xAI following reports that its Grok chatbot produced sexual images of real people without their consent.\n\nThe group says organizations dabbling in generative AI need to build safeguards from the start and think carefully about risks such as non-consensual imagery, misuse of someone's likeness, and potential harms to children – all areas where the tech has raced ahead of social norms and, in some cases, common sense.\n\nThe regulators stress that the law already covers this, and that firms don't get a free pass just because the content came from a machine.\n\nWilliam Malcolm, executive director of Regulatory Risk & Innovation at the ICO, said: \"People should be able to benefit from AI without fearing that their identity, dignity or safety are under threat. AI already plays a large role in all our lives, and everybody has a right to expect that AI systems handling their personal data will do so with respect. Responsible innovation means putting people first: anticipating the risks and building in meaningful safeguards to ensure autonomy, transparency, and control.\n\n\"Public trust is foundational to the successful adoption and use of AI. Joint regulatory initiatives like this show global commitment to high standards of data protection in AI systems and help provide regulatory certainty. We expect those developing and deploying AI to act responsibly. Where we find that obligations have not been met, we will take action to protect the public.\"\n\nThe joint statement on AI-generated imagery suggests that if companies want to keep pushing ever more realistic AI into everyday products, they should expect regulators to keep asking awkward questions about how it all works. ®",

    "description": "Daron Acemoglu told Fortune Donald Trump’s AI policy could jeopardize U.S. democracy, but AI proponents say any regulation would hamper AI innovation.",
    "fullText": "Most critics of President Donald Trump view him as the ultimate threat to American democracy. But to Nobel prize-winning economist Daron Acemoglu, Trump’s merely a fever, the result of an infection that’s been brewing for years before he rode down the golden escalator to announce his presidency.\n\nThe MIT economist has spent decades studying the origins of economic and political decay, specializing in how institutions foster inclusive growth—or succumb to extractive systems. In the 2012 book Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty, Acemoglu and co-writer James A. Robinson argue that nations proper because of their political institutions. In 2024, Acemoglu won the Nobel Prize in economics, alongside Robinson and Simon Johnson, for demonstrating how political and economic institutions shape prosperity.\n\nHow do experts differ on AI's job impact?\n\nWhat is Acemoglu's 'pro-worker' AI development approach?\n\nWhy does Acemoglu view Trump as symptom, not cause?\n\nHow could AI-driven inequality threaten American democracy?\n\nAcemoglu argued that while Trump’s authoritarian tendencies are weakening the country’s institutions, the president is not the root cause of the broader structural problems. He warned the country is headed down a grim path and outlined two shifts relative to AI development he sees as critical to avoiding deeper decline: cracking down on economic inequality and tempering job destruction. “If we go down this path of destroying jobs [and] creating more inequality, U.S. democracy is not going to survive,” he told Fortune.\n\nOne: The proliferation of economic inequality\n\nAccording to Acemoglu, AI-driven job displacement could be catastrophic and further entrench inequality. He notes the U.S. is currently seeing unprecedented levels of wealth inequality, and traditional policy has failed to close the gap. “We may need wealth taxes because anything else we do today is still going to lead to this huge wealth gap that exists in this country.”\n\nThe economist pointed to California’s proposed “billionaire tax,” a ballot initiative which would impose a one-time 5% wealth tax on all individuals in the state with a net worth of $1 billion or more. But even that doesn’t go far enough, according to the economist. “It’s not enough to tax the rich,” he said. “You really need ways in which workers of all sorts of skills can take part in the growth process.”\n\nBut AI proponents say Acemoglu’s diagnosis of AI development is counterintuitive. Adam Thierer, senior fellow at the think tank R Street Institute and longtime advocate for technological innovation, believes AI will spawn opportunities, driving the economy into the future. “The way we get new and better jobs and opportunities is through technological improvements in society and our economy,” Thierer told Fortune.",

In 2022, the DMV had accused Tesla of misleading consumers by using “autopilot” and “full self-driving” for its advanced driver-assistance features.\n\nThe DMV narrowed its focus in December to the term “autopilot” as Tesla revised its use of the term “full self-driving” to clarify that driver supervision is required. “Autopilot” enables Tesla vehicles to accelerate, brake and remain within their lanes on highways. “Full self-driving” allows vehicles to change lanes and respond to traffic signals on city streets.\n\nThe judge had recommended that regulators suspend Tesla’s license to sell cars for 30 days, but the regulators gave the company a 90-day window to make changes. They decided it had done that sufficiently to fix the deceptive marketing.\n\nThe reprieve from the California DMV comes as Tesla and other electric vehicle makers grapple with a plunge in demand after the expiration of key tax credits that had boosted sales. Musk has switched the company’s focus toward robotaxis equipped with self-driving technology, as well as humanoid robots.",

    "fullText": "As Gavin Newsom departs, ultra-wealthy flex wealth and influence to fight regulation and keep the boom going\n\nTech billionaires are leveraging tens of millions of dollars to influence California politics in a marked uptick from their previous participation in affairs at the state capitol. Behemoths such as Google and Meta are getting involved in campaigns for November’s elections, as are venture capitalists, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs and Palantir’s co-founders. The industry’s goals run the gamut – from fighting a billionaire tax to supporting a techie gubernatorial candidate to firing up new, influential super political action committees (Pacs).\n\nThe phenomenon squarely fits the moment for the state’s politics – with 2026 being the year that Politico has dubbed “the big tech flex”.\n\nGavin Newsom, California’s tech-friendly governor who’s been quick to veto legislation that cramps the sector’s unfettered growth, is reaching his term limit. That means Silicon Valley needs to find a new ally. The industry may have found its candidate in an upstart mayor from San Jose, Matt Mahan.\n\nSilicon Valley’s businesses and billionaires – some of the richest and most powerful on earth, most of which are headquartered in California – are in the midst of a massive AI boom. Industry insiders say tech companies need to ensure they can continue to flourish without regulations getting in the way.\n\n“This is a golden opportunity and a golden moment for tech to reset its priorities and its perceptions,” said David McCuan, a political science professor at Sonoma State University who studies state lobbying.\n\nRather than going all-in on one candidate or issue, McCuan said the tech sector is using a multi-pronged attack in California. Tech billionaires are contributing to campaigns ranging from candidates for governor to local city council and school board races. They are also donating heavily to groups campaigning for relaxed taxation and minimal regulation around AI.\n\n“If you’re an uber-zillionaire, you give money early and often,” McCuan said. “They have more wealth and resources than they’ve ever had before, so that allows them to play on both sides of the aisle and up and down the ballot and across issues like never before.”\n\nUnlike other industries, such as oil and pharma, tech has been relatively tame when it comes to lobbying in the state. The industry has tended to focus on narrow state issues and instead spent big and broad at the federal level (aside from Uber and Lyft’s massive $200m ballot measure campaign in 2020). That ethos has changed. California is now ground zero for tech titans working to become omnipresent in politics.\n\nRobert Singleton, the senior director of policy in California for the tech industry group Chamber of Progress, said this moment has been brewing for a long time and it just needed the right thing to set it off.\n\n“The introduction of that billionaire tax obviously galvanized a lot of wealthy individuals who don’t want to see that happen, and who will spend money to make sure it doesn’t happen,” Singleton said. “That tipped them into wanting to get more involved.”\n\nThe “California Billionaire Tax Act”, often referred to simply as the billionaire tax, is a proposal that would require any California resident worth more than $1bn to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state. It’s sponsored by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, and if it receives enough signatures from California voters, it will go to the ballot in November.\n\nWhen the proposal was put forward at the end of last year, many among tech’s billionaire elite threw a tantrum.\n\nSome opened offices or bought mansions in Florida or Texas, vowing to leave California for good. The fleeing rich included Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel, whose current net worth is $25bn; Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth around $255bn and $240bn respectively; and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, whose net worth is not publicly known. Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, worth $229bn, has also bought a property in south Florida valued between $150 and $200m.\n\nThiel has additionally led the charge in donating to a lobbying group, the California Business Roundtable, which has pledged to fight the wealth tax. The Palantir co-founder handed over $3m to the political action committee in late December. Other major donors include realtors, entrepreneurs and private equity firms. James Siminoff, who founded the camera-embedded Ring doorbell company, also donated $100,000, according to public records.\n\n“The most powerful money in politics is to be on the no-side of a ballot measure,” said McCuan. “You can even pre-empt something getting to the ballot, like a billionaire’s tax, by explaining to everyone out there that this is a bad idea for economic growth.”\n\nTech investors and venture capitalists have been extremely vocal in their opposition to the tax, saying that the state will lose revenue as billionaires flee and it will hurt the state’s ability to be economically competitive.\n\nJust this week, Chamath Palihapitiya, a former Facebook executive and current venture capital investor, wrote “the loss of this tax revenue was totally avoidable but is now forever”. Balaji Srinivasan, an investor and former chief technology officer of Coinbase, wrote, “the most successful tech founders of all time have now exited the failed state of California”.\n\nAdding on, Paul Graham, the co-founder of seed capital firm Y Combinator, wrote: “It’s important that people like Zuck and Larry Page are willing to move in response to the proposed wealth tax. It shows politicians what will happen if they try things like this.”\n\nJoining the billionaires, Newsom has pledged to fight the tax, saying it will “drive a race to the bottom” and stifle innovation as the ultra-wealthy leave. “This will be defeated – there’s no question in my mind,” Newsom told the New York Times in January. “I’ll do what I have to do to protect the state.”\n\nOutcry over taxes is just one of the ways the tech sector is ramping up its influence campaign. Several Super Pacs have popped up over the past few months and tech is injecting these committees with tens of millions.\n\nMcCuan said this strategy is helpful for the ultra-wealthy because it allows them to stay behind the scenes, while donating limitless money.\n\n“You could create some amorphous sounding organization like ‘Californians for All That is Good and Right Under the Sun’,” McCuan said. “And who knows what the hell that is, but that entity becomes the vehicle to which others give money … and it becomes very difficult to unpeel and unfurl what is going on.”\n\nMeta launched two new Super Pacs last fall, which are focused on dialing back AI regulation and supporting AI-friendly candidates. The company contributed $45m to one, the American Technology Excellence Project, which will operate in several states but hasn’t yet established a committee in California. The other, Mobilizing Economic Transformation Across (Meta) California, is state-specific and has received one $20m contribution from Meta.\n\nThe social media giant has also matched Google in infusing a separate Super Pac called California Leads with a total of $10m. Ron Conway, a longtime Democratic tech donor, has also donated $100,000 to this committee, which says it aims to support favorable candidates in the state but will not just focus on issues affecting the tech industry, according to Politico.\n\nThe crypto industry is getting into Super Pacs too, debuting a group called Grow California. The committee opened with $10m from crypto executive Chris Larsen and evangelist Tim Draper. Larsen told the New York Times he plans to give $30m more. The focus of Grow California is to “rebuild a state capital” and shape the state’s legislature.\n\n“We have a group of people who are not acting in a pragmatic way. They’re not looking for balance. They’re completely fucking owned by one side,” Larsen, who’s the chair of crypto company Ripple, told Politico. “So we’re going to work on taking out those people who are not working for the people of California.”\n\nWhile the tech industry is now pushing its influence at the state level, San Francisco has already experienced many of these same tactics at the city level. Backed with Silicon Valley money, several different 501(c)(4) groups formed over the past couple election cycles to throw support behind preferred mayoral and board of supervisor candidates. They also bankrolled successful recall campaigns for a progressive district attorney and members of the school board.\n\nThe California governor’s race has been a crowded field without notable frontrunners. Newsom had been a long-time friend of the tech industry, hosting Google’s Page and Brin as guests at his wedding and referring to Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff as “family”. His departure appears to have Silicon Valley fretting.\n\nSingleton, from the Chamber of Progress, said Newsom had long recognized “how pivotal the technology industry is in California”.\n\nBut then, late last month, Mahan, a moderate Democrat and the mayor of San Jose, announced his candidacy. Before Mahan got involved in politics in 2020, he had a career in the tech sector. He was an undergraduate at Harvard with Zuckerberg, and in 2014 co-founded a startup with funding from Conway, Benioff and Napster co-founder Sean Parker.\n\nMahan appears to be the savior the tech industry had been searching for. Since his candidacy announcement just two weeks ago, millions have poured into his campaign. According to public records, he’s received donations from several venture capitalists, along with Roblox CEO David Baszucki, Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan, GitHub co-founder Chris Wanstrath, Cloudkitchen co-founder Diego Berdakin, and Ring founder Siminoff.\n\nMahan has even courted donors who helped launch companies known for working with the Trump administration, including Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale and Anduril co-founder Matt Grimm and his wife Kimberly Grimm, according to public records.\n\nGoogle’s Brin has also backed Mahan, maxing out the limit for an individual campaign donation at $78,400. Several of Mahan’s other tech backers also maxed out their donations. At this point, Mahan has now raised more than double the two most prominent democrats in the race, Eric Swalwell and Katie Porter.\n\nAs political races and ballot measure campaigns continue to heat up across California in 2026, tech’s influence is only expected to grow.\n\n“It’s going to be a fun session,” Singleton said. That’s for sure.”",

    "description": "Snowpack levels across a wide swath of western US states are among the lowest seen in decades, even as regulators struggle to negotiate water rights in the region.",
    "fullText": "western US are facing record low snowpack levels in the middle of the winter season. The snowpack crisis, which could mean a drier, more wildfire-prone summer, is coming as states are racing unsuccessfully against a deadline to agree on terms to share water in the Colorado River Basin, the source of water for 40 million people across seven states in the West.\n\n“Barring a genuinely miraculous turnaround” in the remainder of the winter, says Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources, the low snowpack “has the potential to worsen both the ecological and political crisis on the Colorado Basin, and then also produce really adverse wildfire conditions in some parts of the West.”\n\nData provided by the US Department of Agriculture show that as of February 12, snowpack was at less than half its normal level in areas across nine Western states—some of the lowest levels seen in decades. It’s common for a particular basin or small area of the West to have low snowpack at this time of year. What’s worrisome, Swain says, is how widespread the snow drought is, stretching in a swath from the bottom of Washington to much of Arizona and New Mexico, and touching as far east as Colorado.\n\n“The numbers are really, really bad,” Swain says. “If this were November, they might be less meaningful. We're not in November—we're heading toward mid-February. The normal numbers are pretty high. To be at half of them means that, in absolute terms, the deficit is large.”\n\nAs much of the East Coast has frozen in the first weeks of the year, many Western states are experiencing some of their warmest winters on record: Parts of Colorado saw temperatures close to 80 degrees Fahrenheit at the start of this week. While precipitation has remained steady in many states—parts of Washington even saw disastrous flooding in December—it’s simply not cold enough in many areas for snow to fall or stay in snowpack.\n\nA study released last year by researchers at Dartmouth found that climate change has led to a reduction in snowpack levels across the northern hemisphere over the past 40 years. A snowpack deficit has some worrisome implications for the West for the rest of the year. Forests with low snowpack dry out faster, and are less resilient against wildfire when the hot season comes. (Wildfire-ravaged forests may also, in turn, be less prepared to keep snowpack around; some recent research has shown that in areas that have recently been burned, snow melts faster than other places.)\n\nMuch of the water supply for the West, including the crucial Colorado River Basin, is set during the winter. Snowpack that accumulates in the cold months melts in the spring; in years with healthy snowpack levels, that water makes its way into streams and reservoirs. Current conditions pose a threat to this dynamic.\n\n“In some places, we don't have a traditional drought—what we've got is a snow drought, where precipitation has been near or above average, but where record warmth has really been driving just a complete decimation of the existing snowpack,” says Swain. The warmth in other areas, he says, has “caused the precipitation that has fallen—which in some cases has been reasonably abundant—to fall as rain, even at 7,000 and 9,000 feet elevation.”\n\nSwain says it’s still early enough in the season that there could be some significant storms to help replenish snow levels in some areas. “The problem is that we've accumulated such a large deficit right now—even if we have near or somewhat above average snowfall for the next few weeks, that might just sort of keep pace with the usual accumulation for the rest of February, without really erasing the accumulated deficit,” he says.",

    "description": "Anthropic and OpenAI now have their own well-funded political groups that will square off in the midterm elections over artificial intelligence safety and regulation.",
    "fullText": "Silicon Valley’s dueling artificial intelligence start-ups now have dueling super PACs.\n\nAnthropic, the safety-focused A.I. company formed by former OpenAI executives, said on Thursday that it was putting $20 million into a new super PAC operation that will be in opposition to super PACs backed by OpenAI’s leaders and investors.\n\nThe donation effectively kicks off a new conflict between the rivals, with this year’s midterm elections as the battleground. At the heart of the disagreement between the companies is whether to regulate the artificial intelligence industry with more safety guardrails around the powerful technology. Anthropic generally favors politicians who are more pro-regulation than OpenAI does.\n\nThe New York Times reported in November that the group Anthropic donated to, Public First Action, was in talks with the company to fund its effort to help ensure that OpenAI did not amass too much political power. The regulation-skeptical super PACs backed by OpenAI’s leaders and investors are called Leading the Future.\n\nIn a blog post on Thursday, Anthropic did not name OpenAI but warned that “vast resources have flowed to political organizations that oppose” A.I. safety efforts.\n\n“The A.I. policy decisions we make in the next few years will touch nearly every part of public life,” the company wrote. “We don’t want to sit on the sidelines while these policies are developed.”\n\nAnthropic’s funding will supercharge an effort to elect federal lawmakers who favor more extensive A.I. regulation, a position at odds with the Trump administration.\n\nPublic First is a dark-money nonprofit, which means it is not required to disclose its donors but can air television ads on behalf of candidates. On Thursday, it said it would begin a television ad campaign “thanking” Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican who is running for governor in her state, for her work on tech policy.\n\nPublic First also funds two allied super PACs. One, Defending Our Values PAC, said it would begin an ad campaign on behalf of Senator Pete Ricketts, Republican of Nebraska, who faces re-election in 2026 and has also been outspoken on A.I. safety.\n\nThe Public First effort was started as a rejoinder to the Leading the Future super PACs backed by OpenAI leaders and investors, which have publicly reported raising over $50 million so far. About half of that came from the OpenAI investor Andreessen Horowitz and about half from the family of Greg Brockman, president and co-founder of OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI, which was until recently a traditional nonprofit, has not been allowed to make direct political contributions. But the company has mounted an aggressive Washington policy push over the last several years, which now includes an expressly political component through its aligned super PACs.\n\nAnthropic, by contrast, is making a contribution in its own name. The San Francisco-based company had spent at least five months “actively working” on a super PAC strategy, said Jack Clark, a co-founder, in September, as part of a broader effort to find its way in Washington.\n\nAnthropic’s $20 million contribution carries some political risks. While OpenAI has been largely embraced by the Trump administration, Anthropic and its chief executive, Dario Amodei, have been perceived as a thorn in the White House’s side. Administration officials such as David Sacks, the White House’s A.I. chief, have regularly and publicly criticized Anthropic. Mr. Sacks said in October that the company was promoting a “state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the start-up ecosystem.”",

    "fullText": "With many unable to access or afford qualified therapists, AI is filling the mental healthcare vacuum, amid calls for tighter regulation\n\nOn a quiet evening in her Abuja hotel, Joy Adeboye, 23, sits on her bed clutching her phone, her mind racing and chest tightening. On her screen is yet another abusive message from her stalker – a man she had met nine months earlier at her church.\n\nHe had asked Adeboye out; when she declined, he began sending her intimidating, insulting and blackmailing messages on social media, as well as spreading false information about her online. There were even death threats.\n\nThe experience is taking its toll on her mental health, leaving her struggling to cope. Family and friends she confided in did not take it seriously, and she cannot afford in-person therapy or counselling. As the feeling of panic rose at the sight of his words, she turns to an alternative: a WhatsApp chatbot called Chat Kemi.\n\n“Good evening, Resilient Joy,” the bot types. “How are you today?”\n\n Adeboye hesitates, then starts typing: “Someone is defaming me online and threatening to kill me, because I refused to date him. I am depressed and confused. What should I do?”\n\nThe chatbot, which Adeboye had heard about at an event on gender-based violence run by an NGO, advises her to deactivate her social media accounts and provide all necessary information about the person making the threats to someone she trusts.\n\nFor the first time in months, Adeboye says, she felt less alone.\n\nAI platforms offering first-line mental health support have proliferated over the past year, with early trials in the US showing mixed results. In Nigeria, where AI has been embraced in many sectors and industries, a growing number of people turn to chatbots for virtual therapy.\n\nNigeria’s health system, including its mental health provision, has long been underfunded. Between 2015 and 2025, Nigeria has consistently spent less than 5% of its budget to healthcare, with 4.2% allocated for 2026, far less than the 15% target that African Union member states agreed to as part of the 2001 Abuja Declaration. It is not known how many people in Nigeria live with mental health conditions but, with only 262 psychiatrists in a country of 240 million people, most do not get adequate treatment.\n\nThe shortages have been exacerbated by the Trump administration dismantling USAID, which has badly hit services in Nigeria, especially at the primary level, having a devastating effect on patients in communities already struggling with HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and other health challenges. More than 90% of Nigerians have no health insurance, and now face uncertainty over access to services and feelings of helplessness over rising costs.\n\nPrivate healthcare is expensive; one therapy session can cost between 50,000 naira (£27) – the equivalent of a week’s worth of groceries. Cultural stigma remains strong; many Nigerians still associate mental illness with spiritual weakness or witchcraft.\n\nCommercial and nonprofit AI initiatives are starting to fill this vacuum. HerSafeSpace is an organisation that offers free and instant legal and emotional assistance to victims of technology-facilitated gender-based violence in five west and central African countries. Its Chat Kemi service is available in local and international languages.\n\n“These services don’t replace therapy,” says its founder, Abideen Olasupo. Instead, the chatbot uses a referral system to direct users and specific cases to mental health, legal or psychosocial professionals or organisations, should the need arise.\n\n“Our major objective is to support young girls, who are particularly vulnerable to gender-based violence, especially online,” he says.\n\nOther platforms in Nigeria offering similar services include FriendnPal, whose AI chatbot provides emotional support, matches patients with licensed therapists and includes mood tracking, psycho-education and ASMR tools to alleviate stress and anxiety.\n\nIts pay-as-you-go model gives users instant access to tailored therapy sessions that can include homework or assessments, according to Esther Eruchie, who created the service in response to the loss of her mother after years of depression caused by her 20-year-old brother’s death.\n\nAnother platform, Blueroomcare, connects clients with licensed therapists through video, voice, text and in-app messaging. It offers in-person outpatient and virtual care at partner clinics nationwide, includes a free wellness assessment, and charges between 5,000 and 51,000 naira for a therapist subscription plan.\n\n“Therapy was often too expensive, and there weren’t enough professionals to meet the demand,” says Moses Aiyenuro, who founded Blueroomcare after his own struggles with depression. “I wanted to build a platform that lowers the barriers to care.”\n\nThe technology used by these apps follows scripts written by licensed Nigerian psychologists and therapists who deliver care to users.\n\nIn Lagos, Oluwakemi Oluwakayode, a mother of four, started using FriendnPal’s chatbot after watching her eight-year-old daughter endure frequent seizures due to cerebral palsy.\n\n“Sometimes, it gave very standard replies,” she admits. “But I could finally say things I couldn’t share with my family. That alone gave me relief.”\n\nLater, the app connected her with a licensed therapist – something she says she would never have considered without AI easing her into it.\n\nDr Joy Aifuobhokhan, a Lagos-based public health doctor, says these platforms’ advantage is that they are more affordable and efficient than conventional therapy. “Digital platforms save time otherwise spent preparing, commuting and waiting [to be seen] at physical consultation centres,” she says.\n\nBut some experts caution that AI cannot provide the same level of expertise as a qualified therapist. “These platforms borrow from clinical methods like CBT [cognitive behavioural therapy] and mindfulness,” says Dr Nihinlola Olowe, a psychologist at Live Still Counselling Services, a Nigerian-based mental health practice.\n\n“They can be useful for coping, but they cannot replace the depth or judgment of professional care.”\n\nEruchie says FriendnPal has run more than 10,000 sessions in the past year, while Olasupo says HerSafeSpace has 1,600 users across three continents. Blueroomcare declined to say how many users it had.\n\nBut measuring the impact based on numbers alone is a challenge. “The real story lies in the engagement,” says Olasupo. “It’s exciting to see that users aren’t just using the app and leaving – they’re coming back again and again.”\n\nFor many patients, the immediacy and anonymity of a chatbot is key to its appeal but the ease of digital care could come at the cost of privacy. Avril Eyewu-Edero, a cybersecurity expert, believes that without introducing strong database protections in Nigeria, sensitive information – such as medical histories – becomes vulnerable the moment it enters an AI system.\n\n“If startups fail to prioritise privacy and encryption from the outset, adoption will stall. Nigerians are eager but wary,” she says.\n\nFounders of the services acknowledge these uncertainties, often highlighting their use of end-to-end encryption, unique codes that identify users or devices without including personally identifiable information, and strict non-sharing policies – even with government authorities, unless compelled by a court order.\n\nNow, medical professionals are calling on the Nigerian government to develop enforceable national standards for AI. Dr Alero Roberts, a public health consultant and lecturer at the University of Lagos’s medical college, says: “AI chatbots for mental health are an innovative solution, but without robust regulation, we are venturing blindly into potentially dangerous territory.\n\n“Robots can’t interpret human emotion as humans do. For people in crisis, like suicidal thoughts or psychosis, human contact is crucial. Someone, even a non-professional, can recognise the need for urgent intervention,” she says. “This is often lost with AI; strong governance is essential.”\n\nUnlike medicines or hospitals, AI mental health platforms operate in a regulatory grey zone. Nigeria’s 2023 Data Protection Act sets baseline privacy standards but lacks specific AI regulations for healthcare.\n\n“The main issue is enforcement, not a lack of laws,” says Ayotunde Abiodun of SBM Intelligence, a thinktank that provides analysis on political, economic and social issues in Nigeria and across west Africa.\n\nBabatunde Bamigboye, head of regulations at the Nigeria Data Protection Commission, a statutory body set up under the 2023 law, says: “Any use involving personal data must comply with the act. The framework focuses on data ethics, testing within sandboxes, and risk mitigation. AI in Nigeria is governed, but not via AI-specific laws.”\n\nIn Lagos, Oluwakayode continues to use FriendnPal. One day, she hopes to afford in-person therapy, but for now, the bot is her companion.\n\n“I know it’s not a real human,” she says. “But at 2am, it feels like someone is there for me. And that’s enough to keep me going.”",

    "description": "A super PAC backed by Andreessen Horowitz, OpenAI, and other tech leaders has targeted New York Assembly member Alex Bores' congressional campaign, marking its first attack against a lawmaker supporting AI regulation.",
    "fullText": "A pro-AI super PAC backed by Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI President Greg Brockman has chosen New York Assembly member Alex Bores — and his congressional bid — as its first target.\n\nThe PAC, dubbed Leading the Future, formed in August with a more than $100 million commitment to support policymakers with a light-touch — or a no-touch — approach to AI regulation. And that means going after policymakers who want to regulate AI. The super PAC has backing from a number of other prominent leaders in tech, including Palantir co-founder and 8VC managing partner Joe Lonsdale as well as AI search engine Perplexity.\n\n“I appreciate how straightforward they’re being about it,” Bores told a room of journalists Monday evening at a Journalism Workshop on AGI impacts and governance in Washington, D.C. “When they say, ‘Hey, we’re going to spend millions against Alex because he might regulate Big Tech and put basic guardrails on AI,’ I just basically forward that to my constituents.”\n\nBores, who’s running to represent the state’s 12th Congressional District, said AI anxieties are on the rise among his constituents, who worry about everything from data centers pushing up utility bills and worsening climate change to chatbots impacting kids’ mental health and automation transforming the job market.\n\nBores is the chief sponsor of New York’s bipartisan RAISE Act, which requires large AI labs to have a safety plan in place to prevent critical harms, follow their own safety plan, and disclose critical safety incidents, like bad actors stealing an AI model. The bill also prohibits AI firms from releasing models with unreasonable risks of critical harm and imposes civil penalties of up to $30 million if companies fail to live up to these standards. The legislation is currently awaiting Gov. Kathy Hochul’s signature.\n\nBores said while drafting and redrafting the bill, he consulted with the large AI firms like OpenAI and Anthropic. Those negotiations led to the removal of provisions like third-party safety audits, which he says the industry refused to accept. Nevertheless, the RAISE Act, and Bores himself, appears to have incurred the ire of Silicon Valley.\n\nZac Moffatt and Josh Vlasto, heads of Leading the Future, told Politico that they would work on a multibillion-dollar effort to sink Bores’ campaign.\n\nIn a statement sent to TechCrunch, they accused Bores of advancing “ideological and politically motivated legislation that would handcuff not only New York’s, but the entire country’s ability to lead on AI jobs and innovation.” The pair said “bills like the RAISE Act threaten American competitiveness, limit economic growth, leave users exposed to foreign influence and manipulation, and undermine our national security.”\n\n“The RAISE Act is a clear example of the patchwork, uninformed, and bureaucratic state laws that would slow American progress and open the door for China to win the global race for AI leadership,” Moffatt and Vlasto said in the emailed statement. “America needs one clear and consistent national regulatory framework for AI that strengthens our economy, creates jobs for American workers, supports vibrant communities, and protects users.”\n\nMany in Silicon Valley have pushed to prohibit states from passing regulation that relates to AI. Earlier this year, a provision blocking state AI laws was slipped into the federal budget bill and was later removed. Now, lawmakers like Sen. Ted Cruz are seeking to resurrect it through other legislative avenues.\n\nBores said he is concerned such a movement could continue to gain legs at a time when the federal government has passed no meaningful AI regulation. Where federal government moves slow, states are like startups — they can function as policy laboratories and move fast to test what works.\n\n“The question should be, has Congress solved the problem?” Bores said. “If Congress solves the problem, then it can tell the states to get out of the way, but if they’re not going to pass a bill that’s actually addressing any of the problems…and then [saying that states can’t do anything] that just doesn’t make sense to me.”\n\nBores also noted he has been in contact with policymakers in other states to work on standardizing legislation, which could combat Silicon Valley’s “patchwork” objection. He also believes that lawmakers should ensure there are no redundancies with the EU AI Act.\n\nBores emphasized that AI regulation isn’t meant to limit innovation, and that he has rejected bills that he thinks would have unintended consequences for the industry.\n\n“Having basic rules of the road, literal or metaphorical, is actually a very pro-innovation stance if done well,” Bores said. “I fundamentally believe that the AI that wins is going to be the AI that is trustworthy. And the pushback from industry to say that government has no role in establishing that trust is one that I think you’re seeing people reject at every level.”",

    "fullText": "Regulators in China want banks to dial back their holdings of US Treasury bonds.\n\nThe move, reported by Bloomberg on Monday, is likely to fuel fresh talk about the \"sell America\" trade and the appeal of the dollar. Chinese authorities cited concentration risk and volatility in US debt markets as the reasons for scaling back.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Chinese banks have been urged to limit new purchases, while those with high exposure have been told to dial back their investments.\n\nTreasury yields, which move inversely to prices, were slightly higher on Monday morning. The dollar dropped more sharply, with the Dollar Index down almost 1% on the news. The fresh dip in the greenback follows its recent decline to four-year lows.\n\nWhile the report notes that the regulators framed the directive around financial stability, rather than geopolitical maneuvering, it's likely to spur more debate in the market about countries' willingness to keep lending to the US.\n\nThe \"sell America\" trade, in which investors dump dollar-denominated assets from stocks to Treasurys, was a focal point of markets last year. It's been fueled by a combination of fiscal concerns amid record-high US debt and deficit spending, as well as weaker trust in US institutions amid threats to central bank independence and ongoing tariff threats. It's also been a force behind the debasement trade, which has boosted gold and other metals in the last year.\n\nBloomberg added that regulators did not specify how much exposure they believe Chinese banks should have to US debt at this time.\n\nData from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange shows that as of September 2025, Chinese banks collectively held $298 billion in US dollar-denominated bonds, but it's not clear how much of that is US Treasury debt.\n\nDonald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke by phone last week, and could meet in Beijing in April.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (PIX11) — A New Jersey mother is sharing her daughter’s story in hopes of changing how high-caffeine drinks are labeled across the country, and the effort is now reaching Capitol Hill.\n\n“That was the day when my life changed forever,” Jill Katz said. It’s been years since her daughter Sarah died. In 2022, the 21-year-old college student went into cardiac arrest while out with friends. Her mother says it all started with a cup of lemonade, packed with caffeine.\n“She was at a friend’s birthday party, in college, and she collapsed. She didn’t make it,” Katz said. “It’s the call that keeps parents awake at night.”\n\nSarah had a heart condition, and her family says she had always been mindful about what she ate and drank. According to her mother, she didn’t realize that 30 ounces of the drink she ordered at a popular restaurant chain contained as much as 390 milligrams of caffeine.\n\nFor context, the FDA says most healthy adults should consume no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, so the drink Sarah had was close to that limit in a single serving. “With grief, there is no restoration, but transformation,” Katz said. “Being involved with her legacy and being able to save other people’s lives in her memory.”\n\nMore: Latest News from Around the Tri-State\n\nThe restaurant chain has since removed the item from its menu following multiple lawsuits.\n\nCaffeine is widely used to boost energy by stimulating metabolism and making the heartbeat faster. Doctors, however, say high doses can be risky, especially for people with underlying conditions.\n\nAccording to the Caffeine Informer database, a single shot of espresso contains about 77 milligrams of caffeine. Energy drinks can range from 80 to 300 milligrams, depending on the brand and size. “When you stimulate so much, and the heart is not prepared for that, they can just collapse,” said cardiologist Dr. Daniel Garcia.\n\nGarcia says the lack of consistent labeling and regulation around caffeine can be dangerous for everyone, from college students to older adults. “As a cardiologist, I advise completely against any energy drink or high-content caffeine drink,” he said. “You don’t know exactly what the amount is and how your body is going to respond.”\n\nNow, Sarah’s death is drawing attention from lawmakers.\n\nNew Jersey Congressman Rob Menendez is pushing for the Sarah Katz Caffeine Safety Act, federal legislation that would require clearer warnings about caffeine in foods and beverages.\n\nRequire companies to clearly list caffeine content on bottles, cans, and packaging.\n\nRequire chain restaurants to disclose caffeine levels on menus.\n\nFlag items with 150 milligrams or more of caffeine with a visible “high caffeine” warning.\n\nAdd advisory language about recommended daily caffeine limits.\n\nOrder federal health agencies to study caffeine’s health effects and launch public education campaigns.\n\nSupporters say the goal is not to ban caffeinated drinks, but to make sure consumers know what they’re getting before they take a sip. “People need to know what they’re putting in their bodies,” Katz said. “We’re not talking about limiting or banning. We’re talking about making an informed choice.”\n\nThe bill has bipartisan support in Congress, with a total of 14 cosponsors, both Republicans and Democrats.",

    "description": "F1 will introduce widespread regulation changes this year and the style required to race the new cars is vastly different to anything the drivers have experienced before",
    "fullText": "Andrea Kimi Antonelli is confident that Formula 1’s more inexperienced drivers will benefit from the 2026 regulation overhaul due to the need to adapt.\n\nF1 promises to look totally different this year with changes to both the chassis, lighter by 32kg plus less downforce, and engine, more reliant on electric power, after four years of ground effect cars.\n\nThere has been vast talk about how drivers will therefore need to adapt their style due to active aerodynamics and energy management playing a bigger role, with some claiming that the 2026 cars go against everything they were taught in karting.\n\nBut the younger drivers, like those who have only been in F1 since last year, may benefit from this overhaul because they’re already used to constantly changing cars and don’t really have one distinct style of racing to fall back on.\n\nAntonelli is one of those, having been fast-tracked to F1 by never contesting more than one season of a junior championship before making his Mercedes grand prix debut at the age of 18.\n\n“For all the rookies that joined F1 last year, coming into this year with a new car is kind of good, because obviously we've been used to drive a different car every year,” said the Italian teen.\n\n“So we've been used to try and adapt as quickly as possible to a new car. So of course on that side, it's good that we have a new car this year, because it's a reset for everyone. Especially for us, that we've been used to every year to a new car, it's good because we've been used to that. Maybe it will help us out to understand the car a bit quicker than others.”\n\nThe Mercedes driver therefore thinks it levels the playing field as everybody has to start from scratch, as opposed to last season where he came in at perhaps a disadvantage to others.\n\n“This is a massive rule change and it kind of resets everything because everyone has to relearn the car,” he added. “So on that side, it's better because obviously last year was last year's, the last year of the old regulation and most of the drivers, they knew the car very, very well and they've been developing that car.\n\n“While this year is definitely completely new, so on the driving side, it's a big opportunity because whoever understands it the best way and earlier than the others can really make the difference.”\n\nThat isn’t to say, however, that the veterans will struggle and automatically get beaten by the youngsters, because being inexperienced still proved costly for Antonelli last season.\n\nAlthough he impressed on occasions with three podiums and a Miami sprint pole, he also suffered many unforced crashes in practice and sometimes struggled with the pressures of being a highly-rated rookie - his home race at Imola being an example.\n\n“The other drivers are not stupid and they're pretty good,” said the 19-year-old. “So I think they will figure it out very quickly as well.\n\n“Experience still counts. With how you approach the year, every weekend, the experience still helps and because, of course, I've done one year in F1 and I've learned a lot, but this year, definitely I will have a different approach at times, but I feel I still need to learn quite a bit.\n\n“So on the experience side, there will still be a bit of a difference, but on the driving side, I think we're all on the same level now as we have the new car. So I think that is going to be a big, big opportunity.”\n\nMercedes rivals push for intervention over F1 engine loophole - but how realistic is it?\n\nGeorge Russell predicts F1 team most likely to challenge the top four in 2026\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "description": "Electric and gas providers more than doubled rate increase requests to state regulators last year, often citing soaring demand from AI data centers.",
    "fullText": "The average American's skyrocketing electric bill has caught the attention of everyone from President Donald Trump to Microsoft executives — just don't expect lower rates in 2026.\n\nElectric and gas utilities asked state regulators to approve $31 billion in rate increases last year, more than double the $15 billion they sought in 2024, a new study from PowerLines, a nonprofit that advocates for utility customers, found.\n\nThe surge in requests from utilities to tack on additional charges to customer bills comes as Big Tech companies continue their sweeping buildout of power-hungry AI data centers across the country. Many utilities have attributed rate increases to unprecedented demand from data centers.\n\nWhile some of those requests are still pending approval, many — including the majority of a $9 billion increase for customers of one Florida power company — have been pushed through and will start showing up on customer bills this year.\n\n\"Gas and electricity are the two fastest drivers of inflation, and not by a little bit more. It's significantly more than what we're used to seeing,\" said Charles Hua, founder and executive director of PowerLines.\n\nTo track rate hikes, PowerLines used publicly available data from investor-owned utilities in the US.\n\nCustomers in southern states were hit hardest by rate-hike requests last year, PowerLines found. Utilities in the region sought approval for more than $14 billion in rate increases. Much of that came from Florida Power and Light's $9 billion rate hike request — nearly all of which regulators approved.\n\nFPL cited population growth and extreme weather events as key factors in its decision to raise rates by such a significant amount.\n\nIn Virginia, residential customers of Dominion Energy, which also delivers power to the world's largest data center hub, will see their bills increase by an average of $13.60 by 2027.\n\nInvestor-owned utilities in the US are on track to spend $1.1 trillion on a massive expansion of the power grid between 2025 and 2029, according to the Edison Electric Institute, a powerful industry lobbying group. It has cited data centers and AI as key drivers of utility spending.\n\nThe majority of residential ratepayers in the US are customers of investor-owned utilities like NextEra Energy, Duke Energy, and Southern Company. These large, publicly traded companies turn a profit for shareholders by recovering the costs of constructing new power plants and lines, plus interest, from their customer bases.\n\nBig Tech and its enormous appetite for power are facing growing public backlash.\n\nEarlier this month, Microsoft said it would be a \"good neighbor\" and \"pay its own way\" for the electricity it uses as it scales its AI data center fleet.\n\nIn a Truth Social post preceding Microsoft's announcement, Trump said his administration will work with tech companies to ensure their data center electricity consumption won't drive up bills for everyone else.\n\n\"I never want Americans to pay higher electricity bills because of data centers,\" Trump said in the post.\n\nSome power grid researchers are skeptical of the forecast demand. They have warned that utilities risk overbuilding new power plants and transmission lines that will have to be paid for but ultimately won't be needed.\n\nHua is pushing regulators to take a closer look at forecast power demand from utilities, which stand to profit from building new infrastructure that could lead to rate hikes. Steering utilities to first consider the latest electric grid-enhancing technologies before building new power plants to serve data centers could also help lower customer electric bills, Hua said.\n\n\"Utilities don't profit on making the grid more efficient. They are constantly trying to build new infrastructure. That's their job,\" said Hua. \"This moment is the perfect justification.\"",

    "fullText": "Tech chiefs waxed poetic about AI to delegates at Davos. Plus, the ‘human’ drama of AI startups and why Tesla is thriving in Texas\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. This week’s edition is a team effort: my colleague Heather Stewart reports on the plans for AI’s world domination at Davos; I examine how huge investments have followed AI companies with little to their names but drama and dreams; and Nick Robins-Early spotlights how lax regulation of autonomous driving in Texas allowed Tesla to thrive.\n\nWhen they weren’t discussing Donald Trump, delegates at the World Economic Forum last week were being dazzled by the prospects for artificial intelligence.\n\nUp and down the main street of the Swiss Alps town, almost every shopfront was temporarily emblazoned with the neon slogan of a tech firm – or a consultancy promising to tell executives how to incorporate AI into their business. Cloudflare’s wood-panelled HQ urged delegates to “connect, protect and build together”, and Wipro’s shouted: “Dream Solve Prove Repeat.”\n\nAt the conference, tech CEOs laid out their hopes for how the physical manifestations of AI will blanket the world in the coming years. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella told a rapt audience about how “token factories”, as he calls datacenters, will have to be distributed across the world, to diffuse the benefits of AI globally.\n\n“To me, a long term, scalable solution is to have all of these token factories part of the real economy connected to the grid, connected to the telco network – and that’s what will drive that scale, whether it’s in the global south, or in the developed world,” Nadella said.\n\nMeanwhile Google was showing off the latest iteration of its Google Glasses to excited delegates; and there were endless sessions in the Davos congress centre about the technology’s potential benefits – including a breathless chat with late addition to the schedule Elon Musk, though with the SpaceX IPO apparently looming, he was keenest to talk about going to Mars.\n\nAway from the glitzy shopfronts, though, there was significant concern being expressed that all this proves to be an epic bubble.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, DeepMind chief Demis Hassabis warned that some aspects of AI investment do look, “bubble-like”, but insisted that, “if the bubble bursts, we [ie Google, not society at large] will be fine”.\n\nNadella offered one test for how we would know if it is a bubble – which I didn’t find reassuring. “A tell-tale sign of this as a bubble, is if all we’re talking about are the tech firms,” he said.\n\nMuch of Silicon Valley has been captivated over the past week by a “very human drama”, as the Wall Street Journal put it. Thinking Machines Lab, a startup founded by former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati, fired her own chief technology officer, Barret Zoph, over a relationship with a colleague and a recent lack of productivity, per the Journal. Within hours, her ex-employee – along with one of her co-founders and a third employee – had reportedly signed offers with OpenAI, which they left just last year to join her startup. The three had told her they disagreed with the direction of the company in the meeting that ended with Zoph’s firing, according to the Journal. For his part, Zoph told the Journal that Murati had fired him simply for telling her he was considering another job.\n\nAs dishy as the drama might be, the stakes of Murati’s mess differ from a juicy celebrity entanglement that might be chronicled in TMZ or Page Six, two of my favorite publications. The stakes in San Francisco are billions of real dollars and more than $10bn potential ones. Murati’s company has raised $2bn in venture capital since its founding in February 2025. It is valued at $12bn. The talent involved in these California productions – not movies but rather AI tools used by hundreds of millions of people – takes on superstar significance.\n\nThinking Machines has released one product, Tinker, in October 2025, meant to streamline the customization of large language models, a rather niche concern in comparison with ChatGPT’s ambitions to replace Google search or Claude’s coding aptitude.\n\nThe massive investment and resulting valuation are chasing little in terms of real offerings from the company. A new company profiled in the New York Times last week, Humans&, has naught but a dream, an ugly website – and several hundred million dollars. Researchers from Google, Anthropic, and Elon Musk’s xAI, including one who helped develop the notorious Grok AI tool, founded the company just three months ago. They aim to facilitate collaboration between humans and machines rather than separation – “innovations in long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning, memory, and user understanding”, per the site. If that sounds gauzy, it is because the company has not launched a product.\n\nHumans& has raised $480m from Nvidia, Jeff Bezos, and Google, per the New York Times. It is valued at $4.48bn. It has – say it with me one more time – not launched a product.\n\nWhatever fears of an AI bubble may be circulating, the money is still flowing, chasing after the future with an enormous but uncertain bet in the present.\n\nElon Musk announced last week that Tesla had removed human safety monitors from its Robotaxis in Austin, Texas, as the company moves to expand its autonomous vehicle business. As with most things Musk, the reality was a bit more complicated – Tesla’s vice-president of software later clarified on X that the company had deployed “a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors”.\n\nWhat Tesla’s test-run of fully driverless vehicles did highlight, however, was the difference between how much leeway Texas gives autonomous vehicles compared with California, the birthplace of autonomous driving in the US and the home of the highest number of self-driving cars in the country. The Texas department of motor vehicles does not have regulatory authority over autonomous vehicles in the state, instead autonomous vehicles are governed by the state’s transportation code. Although a new government authorization system for autonomous vehicles is set to be implemented in the coming months, there’s currently no application process required for autonomous vehicle operators in the state. \n\n “Autonomous vehicles on Texas roads are subject to all traffic laws and can be cited for safety violations, but do not yet require specific authorization to operate,” the Texas DMV said.\n\nAlso surprising is the state’s lack of regulations on operating an autonomous vehicle if it’s for personal, non-commercial use. As long as it complies with some stipulations, such as traffic laws and safety standards, an autonomous vehicle can drive around Texas without anyone in the car.\n\n “Any motor vehicle equipped with an automated driving system may operate in this state,” the Texas transportation code states. “An automated motor vehicle may operate in this state with the automated driving system engaged, regardless of whether a human driver is physically present in the automated motor vehicle.”\n\nMeanwhile in California, the state’s department of motor vehicles requires three stages of testing and permitting for commercial autonomous vehicles. Regulators are also in the process of considering new rules that could add even more requirements on vehicle operators. Tesla caused confusion last October when Musk announced a ride-hailing service in the Bay Area, only for regulators to say that the company did not have authorization to operate paid or unpaid autonomous rides to the public. On the Robotaxi section of Tesla’s website, it only mentions Texas.",

    "description": "Regulators said the company’s lack of controls had led to the widespread use of deepfakes created with the chatbot Grok.",
    "fullText": "European Union regulators on Monday announced an investigation of Elon Musk’s social media platform X after the authorities said that it had failed to stop the spread of sexualized images generated by artificial intelligence.\n\nThe inquiry is likely to escalate a confrontation between Europe and the United States over the regulation of online content. Mr. Musk and his allies in the Trump administration have sharply criticized European Union internet regulations as an attack on free speech and American companies.\n\nThe European authorities said that X was being investigated for possible violation of the Digital Services Act, alleging that the company had not properly addressed the “systemic risks” of integrating the A.I. chatbot Grok into its service. Starting in late December, sexually explicit images generated by Grok, including of children, flooded the service, drawing worldwide criticism from victims and regulators.\n\nMr. Musk was facing mounting scrutiny in Europe even before this latest Grok controversy. Last month, X was fined 120 million euros, or about $140 million, for violating Digital Services Act rules around deceptive design, advertising transparency and data sharing with outside researchers.\n\nThe European authorities have another investigation underway about X’s recommender algorithm and policies for preventing the spread of illicit content.\n\n“Nonconsensual sexual deepfakes of women and children are a violent, unacceptable form of degradation,” Henna Virkkunen, the European Commission executive vice president who oversees enforcement of the Digital Service Act, said in a statement. “We will determine whether X has met its legal obligations under the D.S.A., or whether it treated rights of European citizens — including those of women and children — as collateral damage of its service.”\n\nThe European Commission, the executive body for the 27-nation European Union, did not give a timeline for the investigation, but said that it had the authority to order X to make changes during the inquiry in the “absence of meaningful adjustments” to the service.\n\nA spokeswoman for X referred to a previous statement the company had made about Grok. “We remain committed to making X a safe platform for everyone and continue to have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, nonconsensual nudity and unwanted sexual content,” the statement said.\n\nThe latest investigation illustrates a growing divide between the European Union and the United States over free speech and regulation of the internet. European officials argue that the lack of safeguards on platforms like X has allowed hate speech, misogyny and violent content to flourish online. Mr. Musk and the Trump administration have said efforts to force the companies to more proactively police the services amounts to censorship.\n\nThe Digital Services Act, passed in 2022, requires companies to meaningfully address the spread of illegal content, the definition of which varies from country to country in the European Union. It can include material that targets individuals based on their race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality or religion.\n\nEuropean regulators said that the integration of Grok into X exposed “citizens in the E.U. to serious harm.” The British authorities are also investigating the issue.\n\nThe problems began last month. In response to simple user prompts on X, the chatbot automatically created and publicly posted manipulated photographs of real people, including children, to remove their clothes, put them in skimpy clothing or pose them in sexualized situations.\n\nAs criticism grew, X limited Grok’s A.I. image creation to users who paid for premium features, which reduced the number of images. X later expanded those guardrails, saying that it would no longer allow anyone to prompt Grok’s X account for “images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis.”\n\nEuropean Union regulators said that they would take X’s policy changes into account during the investigation.",

It is being used to automate administrative tasks or even help with core operations, including processing insurance claims and assessing customers’ credit-worthiness.\n\nBut the UK has failed to develop any specific laws or regulations to govern their use of AI, with the FCA and Bank of England claiming general rules are sufficient to ensure positive outcomes for consumers. That means businesses have to determine how existing guidelines apply to AI, leaving MPs worried this could put consumers and financial stability at risk.\n\n“It is the responsibility of the Bank of England, the FCA and the government to ensure the safety mechanisms within the system keeps pace,” said Meg Hillier, chair of the Treasury committee. “Based on the evidence I’ve seen, I do not feel confident that our financial system is prepared if there was a major AI-related incident and that is worrying.”\n\nThe report flagged a lack of transparency around how AI could influence financial decisions, potentially affecting vulnerable consumers’ access to loans or insurance. It said it was also unclear whether data providers, tech developers or financial firms would be held responsible when things went wrong.\n\nMPs said AI also increased the likelihood of fraud, and the dissemination of unregulated and misleading financial advice.\n\nIn terms of financial stability, MPs found that rising AI use increased firms’ cybersecurity risks, and left them overly reliant on a small number of US tech companies, such as Google, for essential services. Its uptake could also amplify “herd behaviour”, with businesses making similar financial decisions during economic shocks and “risking a financial crisis”.\n\nThe Treasury committee is now urging regulators to take action, including the launch of new stress tests that would assess the City’s readiness for AI-driven market shocks. MPs also want the FCA to publish “practical guidance” by the end of the year, clarifying how consumer protection rules apply to AI use, and who would be held accountable if consumers suffer any harm.\n\n“By taking a wait-and-see approach to AI in financial services, the three authorities are exposing consumers and the financial system to potentially serious harm”, the report said.\n\nThe FCA said it had already “undertaken extensive work to ensure firms are able to use AI in a safe and responsible way”, but would review the report’s findings “carefully”.\n\nA spokesperson for the Treasury said: “We’ve been clear that we will strike the right balance between managing the risks posed by AI and unlocking its huge potential.”\n\nThey added that this involved working with regulators to “strengthen our approach as the technology evolves”, and appointing new “AI champions” covering financial services “to ensure we seize the opportunities it presents in a safe and responsible way”.\n\nA spokesperson for the Bank of England said it had “already taken active steps to assess AI-related risks and reinforce the resilience of the financial system, including publishing a detailed risk assessment and highlighting the potential implications of a sharp fall in AI-affected asset prices. We will consider the committee’s recommendations carefully and will respond in full in due course.”",

    "fullText": "CHICAGO (AP) — Caleb Williams' last throw in regulation was a backpedaling, fourth-down rainbow that landed in Cole Kmet's hands in the corner of the end zone for a breathtaking touchdown.\n\nHis last throw of the game was the beginning of the end for Chicago's surprising season.\n\nWilliams almost rallied the Bears to another memorable win on Sunday night. But he threw his third interception in overtime and Matthew Stafford drove the Los Angeles Rams to Harrison Mevis' winning field goal in a 20-17 victory in the divisional round of the playoffs.\n\n“It's tough. In these moments, you feel that you let your team down,” Williams said. “You feel this or that. It’s a good lesson learned for us, first time being in this situation for me and for us as a team. I’m excited for what’s to come. But obviously going to go back and watch this and figure out how I can be better, and that’s the exciting part.”\n\nThe 24-year-old Williams led Chicago to an NFL-record seven wins this season when trailing in last 2 minutes of regulation. He threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to DJ Moore with 1:43 left in a 31-27 victory over Green Bay in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nThis time, the Bears (12-7) were losing 17-10 when they got the ball back with 1:50 left in the fourth quarter. And, just like before, Williams delivered.\n\nFacing a fourth-and-4 at the Rams 14 with 27 seconds left, Williams took a shotgun snap and surveyed the field. The No. 1 pick in the 2024 draft was forced to backpedal as the pocket collapsed, and he scampered all the way back to the 40 with Jared Verse, Josaiah Stewart and Braden Fiske all in pursuit for the Rams.\n\nWilliams turned, saw Kmet in the end zone and threw the ball in his direction just as Verse and Stewart got to the second-year QB.\n\n“I ended up getting a little bit of pressure, so try and break contain and just break angles and slow those guys down so that when I do turn around, I can have a little bit more time possibly to find somebody,” Williams said, “and they did a good job containing me, so I just gained a little bit more depth, and I saw Cole one-on-one over there.”\n\nKmet wrestled with Rams cornerback Cobie Turner before hauling in the pass, sending a charge through the crowd of 60,253 on a frigid night at Soldier Field.\n\n“It felt like a pretty easy pitch-and-catch and kind of felt like it was in slow motion,” Kmet said. “I can’t believe Caleb.”\n\nBears coach Ben Johnson called the throw “ridiculous.”\n\n“There’s some things that you just can’t coach. ... He’s got a knack, he’s clutch,” Johnson said.\n\nAccording to Next Gen Stats, Williams' pass traveled 51.2 yards in the air for the longest completed pass by air distance in the red zone since at least 2016. He made the throw from 26.5 yards behind the line of scrimmage; no quarterback since 2016, according to Next Gen Stats, had completed a pass from a depth of more than 22 yards.\n\nIt had a completion probability of 17.8%.\n\n“It was the most special throw that I’ve ever seen. I’ve seen him do that so many times this year,” Bears safety Kevin Byard said.\n\nWilliams also threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Moore on fourth down on the first play of the second quarter. But his three interceptions were costly.\n\nThe Bears had a chance to win the game in overtime. They drove to the Los Angeles 48 before Williams was picked off by Rams safety Kam Curl on a deep ball intended for Moore.\n\n“Just a miscommunication between him and I,” Williams said. \"Tried to flatten him off under the safety, and he kept it vertical from what I saw, obviously, in the moment.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "description": "An ugly first regulation loss at Ball Arena.",
    "fullText": "After a long winter’s nap the Colorado Avalanche hosted the Nashville Predators in their ongoing seven-game home stand. It was the fourth and final meeting between these teams this season and by far the ugliest as Colorado dropped their first regulation game at home in a 7-3 defeat.\n\nA Ryan O’Reilly hat trick punctuated the loss. Brock Nelson scored two goals and Martin Nečas added one for Colorado. Mackenzie Blackwood made 28 saves in defeat.\n\nIt took all of 30 seconds for the game’s first score, unfortunately it was from the visitors. Ryan O’Reilly got free in front of the net and swiftly put a backhand past Mackenzie Blackwood in his return to the crease. That lead didn’t last long as Nashville immediately gave it back a minute later when Brock Nelson deposited his own puck at the net front past Juuse Saros.\n\nAction calmed down a bit after the early scoring barrage but déjà vu struck as Nashville got on the board again from O’Reilly as he was awarded a goal after Samuel Girard placed a perfect tip on the puck right through Blackwood’s five-hole. The Avalanche responded back with another Nelson goal as he deflected a Josh Manson shot. And that’s how the first period would end, a 2-2 tie.\n\nTo start the second period the Avalanche had their chances but after a failed Avalanche power play, O’Reilly completed the hat trick with his own tipped shot to give Nashville the lead again. Your move, Brock Nelson. But the equalizer never came as Nashville scored their fourth goal on a rush from Michael Bunting to end the period 4-2 in Nashville’s favor.\n\nThere were quick signs of life to start the third period as Martin Nečas received a slap pass from Nathan MacKinnon in the slot to bring Colorado within one just a minute into the frame.\n\nIt would be Nashville who scored the next goal, though, as the Colorado comeback attempt was thwarted. Zakhar Bardakov was assessed a questionable interference penalty which was reviewed and the Predators converted on the subsequent power play. Filip Forsberg got a shot past Blackwood in traffic to restore the two-goal lead with five minutes to go.\n\nFrom there it was desperation mode for the Avalanche as they pulled the goalie and gave up two shorthanded goals to Steven Stamkos and Michael McCarron for a 7-3 Nashville final. An ugly loss for Colorado’s first regulation defeat at Ball Arena this season.\n\nThis was Mackenzie Blackwood’s first start this month and it’s fair to wonder if he was shaking off the rust but giving up five goals on 28 shots really isn’t a great performance. With Scott Wedgewood allegedly healthy now too it will be interesting to see how Jared Bednar chooses to split starts as the schedule picks up moving forward.\n\nQuietly the Avalanche are in a 2-3-1 stretch which coincides with the loss of Gabe Landeskog and Devon Toews. This step back is understandable with the key players missing but assuming full health down the stretch and in the playoffs is faulty especially as it’s a war of attrition to go deep into the summer. The squad can’t just dominate with a full roster.\n\nJared Bednar said there were no positives tonight. “We didn’t do enough to win the hockey game.”\n\n— Meghan Angley (@megangley) January 17, 2026\n\nA weekend off and then the Washington Capitals come to town for a Monday matinee at 2 p.m. MT on the Martin Luther King holiday.",

    "fullText": "STOCKHOLM/LONDON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's Grok chatbot is testing Europe's ability to clamp down on deepfakes and digital undressing of images online, even after regulators scored a rare win by forcing Musk's xAI to curb the creation of sexualized images.\n\nxAI said late on Wednesday ​it had restricted image editing for Grok AI users after the chatbot churned out thousands of sexualized images of women and minors that alarmed global regulators.\n\nThe ‌climb-down by Musk, who initially laughed off the trend, highlights the difficulty of policing AI tools that make it cheap and easy to create explicit content. It is the latest clash between Europe and Musk, following rows ‌over election interference, content moderation and free speech.\n\nMany regulators are still scrambling to develop laws and rules to govern AI, with question marks over what constitutes nudity, how to define consent, and who bears responsibility: the user or the platform.\n\n\"It's really a grey zone with regards to the creation of the nude images,\" Ängla Pändel, a Stockholm-based data protection and privacy lawyer with Mannheimer Swartling, told Reuters.\n\nBritish regulator Ofcom, one of the most vocal on the issue, welcomed the move by Musk, but said its investigation into xAI over the Grok images would continue.\n\n\"Our formal investigation remains ⁠ongoing,\" a spokesperson said. \"We are working round the clock to ‌progress this and get answers into what went wrong and what's being done to fix it.\"\n\nSTRONGEST ENFORCEMENT STILL NEEDED, OFFICIALS SAY\n\nEarlier this month, Grok created hyper-realistic images of women on X manipulated to look like they were in tiny bikinis, degrading poses or even covered in bruises. ‍Some minors were digitally stripped down to swimwear.\n\nUntil Wednesday, Reuters found the chatbot still produced sexualized images privately on demand. That appeared to have been curbed at least in certain geographies on Thursday.\n\nMusk's xAI said it was blocking users from generating images of people in skimpy attire in \"jurisdictions where it's illegal\". It did not identify those jurisdictions.\n\nIn Malaysia and Indonesia the government has imposed temporary bans on Grok, ​while EU and UK regulators called the images unlawful. The UK, France and Italy launched probes, but faced calls for tougher action.\n\n\"Stronger enforcement under the Digital Services Act (DSA) ‌is needed to stop apps and platforms that sexualise or nudify women and children,\" said Christian Democrat MEP Nina Carberry, who called the latest move a \"positive step\".\n\n⁠A European Commission spokesperson said that if the Grok changes were not effective, the Commission would still use the full enforcement toolbox of the EU's DSA against the platform.\n\nLEGAL GREY AREA, HEAVY BURDEN ON VICTIMS\n\nThe UK's Online Safety Act makes the sharing of intimate images without consent, including AI-generated deepfakes, a 'priority offence', said Alexander Brown, a UK-based data protection lawyer at Simmons & Simmons.\n\n\"This means X must take proactive, proportionate steps to prevent such content from appearing on its platform and to swiftly remove it when detected,\" he said.\n\nBritain's regulator can fine a company up to 10% ⁠of revenue in the most serious cases of non-compliance or ask a court to require internet service ​providers to block the site.\n\nFor individuals, taking platforms to court is \"a really difficult and heavy process,” said ​Anders Bergsten, a lawyer at Mannheimer Swartling, citing the emotional toll on victims.\n\nDeepfakes have existed for years, well before the advent of the AI apps, though they were largely confined to the darker corners of the web. The publishing power of X gives Grok unprecedented reach.\n\n\"The frictionless publishing capability enables ‍the deepfakes to spread at scale,\" said U.S.-based ⁠lawyer Carrie Goldberg, who works with cyber harassment victims.\n\nLaws in Britain and Sweden make the non-consensual sharing of nude images illegal. Britain is widening the law to include the making of such images.\n\nUnder the DSA, suspending a service is considered a last resort. The EU AI Act also does not have any provision for nude ⁠images of adults, only transparency obligations for deepfakes, experts said.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer welcomed X's move on Thursday but warned: \"Free speech is not the freedom to violate consent. Young women's images are not public property, ‌and their safety is not up for debate.\"\n\n\"If we need to strengthen existing laws further, we are prepared to do that.\"",

    "description": "A physics professor said AI apocalypse talk distracts from real harms like labor abuse, copyright theft, and weak regulation happening right now.",
    "fullText": "Fixation on futuristic AI catastrophe scenarios is allowing companies to evade accountability for the very real harms their technology is already causing, a professor says.\n\nIn an essay published this week, Tobias Osborne, a professor of theoretical physics at Leibniz Universität Hannover and a cofounder of the scientific communication firm Innovailia, said debates about superintelligent machines and a hypothetical \"singularity\" have become a dangerous distraction.\n\nWhile policymakers and technologists argue over whether AI could one day threaten humanity's survival, he wrote, the industry is inflicting \"real harm right now. Today. Measurably.\"\n\n\"The apocalypse isn't coming,\" Osborne wrote. \"Instead, the dystopia is already here.\"\n\nThe AI debate has increasingly been shaped by doomsday scenarios — including warnings that superintelligent systems could wipe out humanity by design or by accident, become uncontrollable, or trigger civilizational collapse — fears amplified by prominent AI researchers, tech leaders, and government reports.\n\nIn comments to Business Insider, Osborne said the fixation on such scenarios has a concrete effect on regulation and accountability.\n\n\"By framing themselves as guardians against civilizational catastrophe, AI firms are treated like national-security actors rather than product vendors, which dilutes liability and discourages ordinary regulation,\" he said.\n\nThat shift, Osborne said, allows companies to externalize harm while benefiting from regulatory deference, secrecy, and public subsidies.\n\nHe added that some of the most overlooked risks today include psychological harm linked to chatbot use and widespread copyright and data expropriation.\n\nApocalypse-style narratives persist, he said, because they are easy to market, difficult to falsify, and help shift corporate risk onto the public.\n\nWhile the European Union has begun rolling out the AI Act — a sweeping regulatory framework that will phase in stricter rules through 2026 — the US is moving in the opposite direction, with federal efforts focused on limiting state-level AI regulation and keeping national standards \"minimally burdensome.\"\n\nOsborne's essay laid out a long list of present-day harms he believes are being sidelined.\n\nIt includes the exploitation of low-paid workers who label AI training data, the mass scraping of artists' and writers' work without consent, the environmental cost of energy-hungry data centers, and a flood of AI-generated content that makes it harder for people to find trustworthy information online.\n\nHe also takes aim at the popular idea that AI is racing toward a runaway intelligence explosion.\n\nIn the essay, Osborne described such claims as \"a religious eschatology dressed up in scientific language,\" saying that such scenarios collapse when confronted with physical limits, such as energy consumption and thermodynamics.\n\n\"These aren't engineering problems waiting for clever solutions,\" he wrote. \"They're consequences of physics.\"\n\nRather than focusing on speculative future threats, Osborne said policymakers should apply existing product liability and duty-of-care laws to AI systems, forcing companies to take responsibility for the real-world impacts of their tools.\n\nOsborne said that he is not opposed to AI itself.\n\nIn his essay, he highlighted the genuine benefits large language models can offer, especially for people with disabilities who struggle with written communication.\n\nBut he warned that without accountability, those benefits risk being overshadowed.\n\n\"The real problems,\" he wrote, \"are the very ordinary, very human problems of power, accountability, and who gets to decide how these systems are built and deployed.\"",

    "description": "Energy regulators and advocates are cautiously optimistic about Microsoft's promise to \"pay its own way\" for the power needed to serve its AI footprint.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft is promising to cover the costs of electricity needed to power its rapidly growing fleet of data centers in suburban and rural communities across the US.\n\nIn a speech on Tuesday, Brad Smith, the president and vice chair of the Big Tech giant, said that going forward, Microsoft will \"pay utility rates that are high enough to cover our electricity costs.\"\n\nIt's a bold pledge to make at a time when AI is fueling a historic surge in demand for power in the US, and electric bills are surging for the average American utility customer.\n\nIt is also one that state regulators have heard before as utilities, their data center customers, and consumer advocates argue over who will bear the cost of new infrastructure needed to serve AI's enormous appetite for power.\n\nBut as the impact of data centers on electricity rates becomes an increasingly hot political flashpoint, Microsoft may have no other choice but to follow through, and the rest of Big Tech might not be far behind.\n\n\"There is no free lunch for tech players, and Trump is watching,\" said Dan Ives, global head of tech research at Wedbush Securities.\n\nIves expects other Big Tech companies to follow Microsoft's lead and make similar pledges addressing local concerns around major data center buildouts sooner rather than later.\n\n\"I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,\" President Trump wrote Monday night in a post on Truth Social.\n\nThe \"big technology companies who build them,\" the president said, \"must pay their own way.\"\n\nTrump wrote that his administration had collaborated with Microsoft on the company's pledge to cover its electricity costs, and alluded to future announcements by other companies.\n\nWhen asked for further comment, the White House Press Office pointed to President Trump's post on Truth Social.\n\nMicrosoft's four-part plan to ensure it is paying its fair share of electricity costs was laid out in a blog post this week. The plan consists of asking utilities and regulators to set their rates high enough to cover their data center costs, collaborating with utilities to cover the costs of new infrastructure, looking for ways to operate data centers more efficiently, and advocating for affordable, reliable power at the state and federal levels.\n\nWhen asked for further comment, a spokesperson for Microsoft pointed to the company's blog post.\n\nConsumer advocates are cautiously optimistic about Microsoft's promise to pay its fair share, but eager to see more details — especially from the utilities that serve the data centers.\n\n\"These are only rough concepts that don't get at the root of the problem, which is the scale and speed at which the industry is moving,\" said Julie Bolthouse, director of land use at Virginia's Piedmont Environmental Council.\n\nDominion Energy, Virginia's largest public utility, has said it is in contract talks with data center customers for 47 gigawatts of new demand — double Dominion's current peak load.\n\nBolthouse is concerned about the legitimacy of that demand — and who might end up footing the bill if it never comes to fruition.\n\n\"The current process of unreviewed contracts between utilities and data centers has broken the planning process and threatens the reliability of the system,\" said Bolthouse.\n\nCharles Hua, founder and director of Powerlines, a nonprofit that advocates for utility regulation reform, said that data centers can be \"good grid citizens\" if local utilities prioritize investment in grid-enhancing technologies and energy efficiency over building new power plants.\n\n\"Doing so will require states to reimagine our outdated system of utility regulation and make necessary changes to center consumers going forward,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "The Toronto Maple Leafs were a tired bunch on Tuesday night in their 6-1 loss to the Utah Mammoth.\n\nIt was never going to be the easiest game for Toronto, given it was the second half of a back-to-back. What made it especially difficult, though, was the marathon they endured against the Colorado Avalanche the night before, which the Maple Leafs won in overtime.\n\nAuston Matthews played a team-high 25:29, four minutes more than William Nylander, who had the next most ice time among forwards. Four of Toronto's six defensemen played more than 20 minutes.\n\nOne storyline entering Tuesday's game was that Matias Maccelli was returning to Utah for the first time since being traded to Toronto in the offseason. Maccelli had the game-winner (and an assist) in his first game against his former club back in Toronto in early November.\n\n\"It's good to be back,\" Maccelli smiled before the game. \"Just try to focus on the game now, and then after the game, say hi to a couple of friends and go on.\"\n\nAnother (smaller) note was Calle Jarnkrok coming in for Nick Robertson, who's day-to-day with a lower-body injury after blocking a shot against the Avalanche.\n\nUtah erased any thought about those storylines quickly on Tuesday.\n\nThree minutes in, Michael Carcone beat Dennis Hildeby after a cross-ice pass by Mammoth defenseman Nate Schmidt. The play started after Nylander and Matthews had a miscommunication and gave up the puck in the neutral zone.\n\nfire drill goal against \n\nMatthews saved a goal beforehand, Hildeby was knocked over and lost his stick pic.twitter.com/7grrOUQ4gZ\n\n— Omar (@TicTacTOmar) January 14, 2026\n\nToronto pushed back quite a bit, but didn't get too many consistent chances. And even when they did earn opportunities, Karel Vejmelka came up big for the Mammoth.\n\nThe second period is when Utah really opened the game up.\n\nDylan Guenther scored back-to-back goals in under a minute and a half, which included a rocket of a shot that beat Dennis Hildeby over the shoulder. Given Hildeby's size (standing at 6-foot-7), he'd definitely like to have that one back.\n\nDylan Guenther doubles the lead\n\nwhat a shot pic.twitter.com/QspMvUpjJt\n\n— Omar (@TicTacTOmar) January 14, 2026\n\nLater in the period, whilst it was 3-0 for the Mammoth, JJ Peterka threw the puck on net from the half wall, which beat a screened Hildeby to put Utah up 4-0.\n\nCalle Jarnkrok, however, did get the Maple Leafs on the board in the third period. He put in a rebound off an Oliver Ekman-Larsson point shot for his sixth goal of the season. But that would be all Toronto could muster up as they lost their first game in regulation since Dec. 21 (11 games ago), a 5-1 loss to the Dallas Stars.\n\nCalle Jarnkrok gets the Leafs on the board 🚨 pic.twitter.com/igpajVIDSM\n\n— Omar (@TicTacTOmar) January 14, 2026\n\nUtah added two more goals late in the third period. Hildeby finished the game, allowing six goals on 40 shots. It's the second time Hildeby has allowed six goals in a game this season.\n\nYou can't take very much from this game on the Maple Leafs' side. Utah, like Toronto, is on the bubble of a playoff spot, and was desperate for a win. Tie that together with the Maple Leafs arriving in Utah early Tuesday morning following their game against the Avalanche — it's honestly a recipe for disaster.\n\nUnless Toronto's opponent is playing as tired as they are, this game was a scheduled loss for the Maple Leafs.\n\nDon't put too much stock into this game. The biggest positive I'd say was seeing Toronto push back in the third period following Jarnkrok's goal. It's pleasant to see the Maple Leafs continue to fight back in what was likely a difficult game — physically and mentally.\n\nNext stop: Vegas for a reunion with Mitch Marner and the Golden Knights.",

    "fullText": "When I tell people that I'm estranged from my mom, I'm nearly always met with an apology. My reply is always to assure them it's OK, because ultimately, it is OK.\n\nGoing no contact with my mom six years ago was a difficult decision to make, but it has had an incredible impact on the way I show up as a parent to my sons, now 8 and 10.\n\nUltimately, I believe the decision to take a step back from my relationship with my mom has made me a better mother.\n\nOn the surface, my own childhood certainly looked idyllic. My dad worked, and my mom stayed home. I did well in school. I was involved. If I expressed interest in an activity, my mom signed me up. She schlepped me around town, to games and competitions, to art classes and orchestra practices. I stood out academically; my report cards always read \"a pleasure to have in class.\" I was a rule follower by nature, seemingly clinging to the order and structure that school offered me.\n\nAt home, I remember raised voices and arguments being the norm. I often busied myself with schoolwork and activities to avoid the chaos of home. It was a win-win. The adults in my life could point to my accomplishments as a sign of their success, and I could stay occupied in spaces that offered structure, praise for my efforts, and refuge from the discomfort that I remember feeling at home.\n\nNow that I'm a mother, I find myself looking back on childhood memories, discovering them colored by a new understanding of the dynamics that had played out. I can see a little girl so overwhelmed and flooded with feelings that she couldn't make sense of them.\n\nWhile I can now empathize a bit with my mother, who dealt with some extenuating circumstances that would be difficult for anyone to navigate, I also recognize that it was probably not the best environment for me to be in as a little girl.\n\nI now have a deeply feeling kid of my own, and boy, can we rile one another up. He quickly escalates when things aren't perfect, the tears and yelling so deeply familiar. I see myself in him, but it also feels different now. I know I can stop the cycle.\n\nI remember feeling such big feelings in such a small body as a child. Just like my son, the sobs came readily for me, too. Any frustration, any struggle, and it would rise in my chest, spilling out despite my best efforts. There wasn't anyone to guide me through making sense of it, but it doesn't need to be that way for my boys. I listen to them and support them.\n\nWhat I learned in unpacking my own past is that the cycle of rupture and repair doesn't have to continue. Distancing myself from my mother has made a new way of approaching life and motherhood a possibility. My job is to model regulation and support my sons, even when their feelings and struggles are hard.\n\nWhile I no longer resent my mom, I do wish she had done the work to save me from the burden I carried for so long. I hope that eventually my sons can look back and appreciate the work I'm putting in every day to make sure we have a long, healthy relationship that has us enjoying each other's company for many years.",

    "fullText": "A Trump administration official credited the president with making small business owners “excited” to pay their taxes thanks to tax cuts and less regulation.\n\nKelly Loeffler, administrator of the Small Business Administration, told Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures that “small business optimism is above its 52-year average.”\n\nLoeffler said a lot of the optimism is due to the Working Families Tax Cut in Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill.”\n\n“Small businesses finally have certainty about what their tax rate’s going to be,” Loeffler said. “That 20% pass-through deduction, now the 179 expensing that means higher limits on the ability to expense immediately for purchases they make in capital equipment, and also R&D expensing.”\n\nThose factors, according to Loeffler, actually have small business owners jazzed about writing a check to Uncle Sam.\n\n“I don’t think small business owners have ever been so excited to pay their taxes thanks to President Trump!” Loeffler said. “He brought us the blue collar boom in his first term, and now he’s going to add to that the small business boom.”\n\nHost Cheryl Casone, in for Maria Bartiromo, asked Loeffler about “those onerous federal regulations under the Biden administration,” and whether removing them “could be another way to boost the health of small business.”\n\n“Absolutely. Regulation is a tax on a small business, and under President Trump in his first year, about $200 billion in regulations have been cut,” Loeffler said.\n\nThe SBA’s goal for 2026 is “to make sure that small businesses are able to have relief after four very active years of regulating under Joe Biden that heaped trillions of dollars on the backs of small businesses,” Loeffler said. “So, we’re leading a strike force at the SBA to roll back even more regulations.”\n\nLoeffler has been criticized for aggressively cutting staff at the SBA, and for rolling back Biden administration changes “aimed at easing access to credit for the smallest enterprises,” The New York Times reported.\n\n“The changes are especially problematic for Black, Hispanic and immigrant entrepreneurs,” the report continued. “In the name of eradicating diversity, equity and inclusion practices, the Small Business Administration is shedding programs aimed at helping disadvantaged businesses, including those run by women.”\n\nWatch above via Sunday Morning Futures on Fox News.\n\nThe post Trump Official Brags On Fox News: ‘I Don’t Think Small Business Owners Have Ever Been So Excited to Pay Their Taxes!’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "title": "‘Artificial stupidity’ made AI trading bots spontaneously form cartels when left unsupervised, Wharton study reveals",
    "description": "AI bots told to act as trading agents in simulated markets engaged in pervasive collusion, raising new questions about how financial regulators have previously addressed this tech.",
    "fullText": "Sasha Rogelberg is a reporter and former editorial fellow on the news desk at Fortune, covering retail and the intersection of business and popular culture.\n\nArtificial intelligence is just smart—and stupid—enough to pervasively form price-fixing cartels in financial market conditions if left to their own devices.\n\nA working paper posted earlier this year on the National Bureau of Economic Research website from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology found when AI-powered trading agents were released into simulated markets, the bots colluded with one another, engaging in price fixing to make a collective profit.\n\nIn the study, researchers let bots loose in market models, essentially a computer program designed to simulate real market conditions and train AI to interpret market-pricing data, with virtual market makers setting prices based on different variables in the model. These markets can have various levels of “noise,” referring to the amount of conflicting information and price fluctuation in the various market contexts. While some bots were trained to behave like retail investors and others like hedge funds, in many cases, the machines engaged in “pervasive” price-fixing behaviors by collectively refusing to trade aggressively—without being explicitly told to do so.\n\nIn one algorithmic model looking at price-trigger strategy, AI agents traded conservatively on signals until a large enough market swing triggered them to trade very aggressively. The bots, trained through reinforcement learning, were sophisticated enough to implicitly understand that widespread aggressive trading could create more market volatility.\n\nIn another model, AI bots had over-pruned biases and were trained to internalize that if any risky trade led to a negative outcome, they should not pursue that strategy again. The bots traded conservatively in a “dogmatic” manner, even when more aggressive trades were seen as more profitable, collectively acting in a way the study called “artificial stupidity.”\n\n“In both mechanisms, they basically converge to this pattern where they are not acting aggressively, and in the long run, it’s good for them,” study co-author and Wharton finance professor Itay Goldstein told Fortune.\n\nFinancial regulators have long worked to address anti-competitive practices like collusion and price fixing in markets. But in retail, AI has taken the spotlight, particularly as companies using algorithmic pricing come under scrutiny. This month, Instacart, which uses AI-powered pricing tools, announced it will end its program where some customers saw different prices for the same item on the delivery company’s platform. It follows a Consumer Reports analysis found in an experiment that Instacart offered nearly 75% of its grocery items at multiple prices.\n\n“For the [Securities and Exchange Commission] and those regulators in financial markets, their primary goal is to not only preserve this kind of stability, but also ensure competitiveness of the market and market efficiency,” Winston Wei Dou, Wharton professor of finance and one of the study’s authors, told Fortune.\n\nWith that in mind, Dou and two colleagues set out to identify how AI would behave in a financial market by putting trading agent bots into various simulated markets based on high or low levels of “noise.” The bots ultimately earned “supra-competitive profits” by collectively and spontaneously deciding to avoid aggressive trading behaviors.\n\n“They just believed sub-optimal trading behavior as optimal,” Dou said. “But it turns out, if all the machines in the environment are trading in a ‘sub-optimal’ way, actually everyone can make profits because they don’t want to take advantage of each other.”\n\nSimply put, the bots didn’t question their conservative trading behaviors because they were all making money and therefore stopped engaging in competitive behaviors with one another, forming de-facto cartels.\n\nWith the ability to increase consumer inclusion in financial markets and save investors time and money on advisory services, AI tools for financial services, like trading agent bots, have become increasingly appealing. Nearly one-third of U.S. investors said they felt comfortable accepting financial planning advice from a generative AI-powered tool, according to a 2023 survey from financial planning nonprofit CFP Board. A report published in July from cryptocurrency exchange MEXC found that among 78,000 Gen Z users, 67% of those traders activated at least one AI-powered trading bot in the previous fiscal quarter.\n\nBut for all their benefits, AI trading agents aren’t without risks, according to Michael Clements, director of financial markets and community at the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Beyond cybersecurity concerns and potentially biased decision-making, these trading bots can have a real impact on markets.\n\n“A lot of AI models are trained on the same data,” Clements told Fortune. “If there is consolidation within AI so there’s only a few major providers of these platforms, you could get herding behavior—that large numbers of individuals and entities are buying at the same time or selling at the same time, which can cause some price dislocations.”\n\nJonathan Hall, an external official on the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee, warned last year of AI bots encouraging this “herd-like behavior” that could weaken the resilience of markets. He advocated for a “kill switch” for the technology, as well as increased human oversight.\n\nClements explained many financial regulators have so far been able to apply well-established rules and statutes to AI, saying for example, “Whether a lending decision is made with AI or with a paper and pencil, rules still apply equally.”\n\nSome agencies, such as the SEC, are even opting to fight fire with fire, developing AI tools to detect anomalous trading behaviors.\n\n“On the one hand, you might have an environment where AI is causing anomalous trading,” Clements said. “On the other hand, you would have the regulators in a little better position to be able to detect it as well.”\n\nAccording to Dou and Goldstein, regulators have expressed interest in their research, which the authors said has helped expose gaps in current regulation around AI in financial services. When regulators have previously looked for instances of collusion, they’ve looked for evidence of communication between individuals, with the belief that humans can’t really sustain price-fixing behaviors unless they’re corresponding with one another. But in Dou and Goldstein’s study, the bots had no explicit forms of communication.\n\n“With the machines, when you have reinforcement learning algorithms, it really doesn’t apply, because they’re clearly not communicating or coordinating,” Goldstein said. “We coded them and programmed them, and we know exactly what’s going into the code, and there is nothing there that is talking explicitly about collusion. Yet they learn over time that this is the way to move forward.”\n\nThe differences in how human and bot traders communicate behind the scenes is one of the “most fundamental issues” where regulators can learn to adapt to rapidly developing AI technologies, Goldstein argued.\n\n“If you use it to think about collusion as emerging as a result of communication and coordination,” he said, “this is clearly not the way to think about it when you’re dealing with algorithms.”\n\nA version of this story was published on Fortune.com on August 1, 2025.",

    "fullText": "The US just escalated its clash with Europe over tech regulation.\n\nThe State Department said it has barred five Europeans, including the EU's former Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton and four members of digital campaign groups, from entering the country over what it called \"censorship\" of tech platforms.\n\nThe visa bans were met with backlash from European leaders on X, who accused Washington of intimidation and political overreach.\n\nThe dispute centers on the EU's Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, which imposes obligations on major tech platforms — many of which are based in the US — to police content and curb anti-competitive behavior. Companies in breach of it can be fined up to 6% of their global annual revenue.\n\nIn a post on X late Tuesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the State Department would block leading figures of what he called \"the global censorship-industrial complex\" from entering the US.\n\n\"For far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose,\" Rubio wrote. \"The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship.\"\n\nFor far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose.

Rogers, the undersecretary of state for public diplomacy, named Breton among the five European individuals sanctioned, accusing him of using the EU's Digital Services Act to pressure Elon Musk and X during his tenure as commissioner for the internal market.\n\nShe also named Imran Ahmed of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, Clare Melford of the Global Disinformation Index, and HateAid co-CEOs Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon, accusing them of pressuring US platforms over online speech. None of the four campaigners immediately responded to a Business Insider request for comment.\n\nRubio added that the US was \"ready and willing to expand this list\" unless officials reversed course, framing the move as a defense of free expression and US sovereignty.\n\nThe back-and-forth has largely played out on X, a platform that was hit with a $140 million fine earlier this month for breaching the Digital Services Act.\n\nBreton responded in Tuesday X post by invoking McCarthy-era politics, asking, \"Is McCarthy's witch hunt back?\"\n\nHe added, \"To our American friends: 'Censorship isn't where you think it is.'\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron also condemned the visa restrictions, describing them in a Wednesday X post as coercive measures aimed at undermining Europe's digital sovereignty.\n\n\"The rules governing the European Union's digital space are not meant to be determined outside Europe,\" he said.\n\nThe European Commission \"strongly\" condemned the US decision, adding that the EU has the sovereign right to regulate its digital market and would seek clarification from US authorities.\n\nIs McCarthy’s witch hunt back? 🧹\n\nAs a reminder: 90% of the European Parliament — our democratically elected body — and all 27 Member States unanimously voted the DSA 🇪🇺\n\nTo our American friends: “Censorship isn’t where you think it is.”\n\n\"Freedom of speech is the foundation of our strong and vibrant European democracy,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wrote on X on Wednesday. \"We are proud of it. We will protect it.\"\n\nGérard Araud, France's former ambassador to the US, said the dispute reflects a deeper rupture, writing on X that \"the West\" no longer exists and that Europe is now alone in defending its interests and values.\n\nHodenberg and Ballon told Business Insider in a joint statement that they are \"not surprised\" by the move, calling it an \"act of repression by a government that is increasingly disregarding the rule of law and trying to silence its critics by any means necessary.\"\n\n\"Despite the significant strain and restrictions placed on us and our families by US government measures, we will continue our work with all our strength — now more than ever,\" the duo said.\n\nThe dispute has been years in the making — and Musk's X has often been at the center of it.\n\nMusk cheered the US move to sanction the officials, writing on X: \"This is so great.\"\n\nThis is so great 🤩 https://t.co/fXAfNbwEVf\n\nBreton repeatedly clashed with Musk after he bought Twitter in 2022 and pledged to loosen moderation in the name of free speech.\n\nAs the then-internal market commissioner, Breton warned that X could face fines or even be barred from the European Union if it failed to comply with EU law, later overseeing a formal investigation into the platform regarding disinformation and content moderation.\n\nThose confrontations turned X into a symbol of the broader transatlantic fight over who sets the rules for online speech — a conflict that has now spilled from regulation into geopolitics.",

Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, those targeted will generally be barred from entering the US, and some may face removal proceedings if already in the country.\n\nRubio did not name those targeted, but under secretary for public diplomacy Sarah Rogers identified them on X, accusing the individuals of “fomenting censorship of American speech”.\n\nThe five named were: Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate; Josephine Ballon and Anna-Lena von Hodenberg, leaders of HateAid, a German organization; Clare Melford, who runs the Global Disinformation Index’; and former EU commissioner Breton.\n\nThe visa bans come after the administration’s National Security Strategy this month said European leaders were censoring free speech and suppressing opposition to immigration policies that it said risk “civilisational erasure” for the continent.\n\nRogers called Breton – who served as the European Commissioner for the internal market from 2019-2024 – “a mastermind” of the DSA.\n\nMelford, co-founder of the Global Disinformation Index (GDI), said in a video posted online in 2024 that she co-founded the organisation “to try to break the business model of harmful online content” by reviewing online news websites to allow advertisers to “choose whether or not they want to fund content that is polarising and divisive and harmful, or whether they want to steer their advertising back towards more quality journalism.”\n\nA spokesperson for GDI called the US action “immoral, unlawful, and un-American” and “an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship.”\n\nMost Europeans are covered by the Visa Waiver Program, which means they don’t necessarily need visas to come into the US. They do, however, need to complete an online application prior to arrival under a system run by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), so it is possible that at least some of these five people have been flagged to DHS, a US official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss details not publicly released.\n\nWith Reuters, the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse",

    "title": "Americans Have Mixed Views of AI – and an Appetite for Regulation",
    "description": "A supermajority of Americans say that AI should be regulated to protect privacy and ensure safety.",
    "fullText": "AI is sweeping the American economy. A majority of Americans are either using AI tools or have tried them. But AI use is only half the story – a supermajority of Americans say that AI should be regulated to protect privacy and ensure safety. And many remain worried about potential job losses stemming from the emerging technology. \n\nIt’s time we did more to understand the national attitudes around AI use, regulation, and favorability.\n\nMost of our respondents had used AI at least once: 58% report using or trying AI, specifically tools like ChatGPT or Claude, divided evenly between fairly regular users (30% use at least a few times a month) and more infrequent users (29% have used AI, but only once a month or less). Nonusers are more likely to be older (62% of people over 65 have never used AI), not have gone to college (47%), or to work in service jobs (35%). Only 18% of white-collar workers say they have never used AI.\n\nAmong those who do use AI, 63% have at least tried it out for work purposes, and 34% report using it at work consistently (a few times a month or more). Work usage, like AI usage overall, is more common among white-collar workers, a majority of whom (55%) use it consistently. Personal use of AI is more common: 91% have at least tried using an AI chatbot or writing tool, and 54% report consistently using it in their personal lives. Gen Z turns to AI more often than its older counterparts, with 68% regularly engaging AI for personal use (compared to just 40% among Boomers).\n\nPersonal AI use encompasses a bunch of different types of application, but by far the most common is information gathering and answering questions (63%). Frequent AI users are especially likely to use AI as an alternative to traditional Google search or other research tools (68%). If this use case continues, messaging and communication on anything from public health to election campaigns will be filtered through AI models before reaching people. This could potentially change how messages are interpreted (particularly given the use of AI summaries), or significantly alter their reach in difficult-to-measure ways. Those interested in talking effectively to Americans should consider how their messaging strategy would work with these AI intermediaries, how their messages will be interpreted by AI, and if what they say will still reach their intended audience.\n\nWhile they know the names of the tools (ChatGPT, etc.), respondents don’t know much about the companies responsible for AI products. This is in contrast with older tech companies: Only 5% haven’t heard of Google, and 79% are favorable toward the company. For Amazon, favorability is at 80%. When asked about OpenAI, 42% hadn’t heard enough to form an opinion. For Anthropic, this figure hit 81%.\n\nAmericans don’t view AI as favorably as other emerging technologies from the past quarter century. Cell phones (76% total positive; net +68), the internet (75% total positive; net +66), and solar energy (72% total positive; net +65) are all viewed as having a very positive impact on society. AI (38% total positive; net +8) is \n\nWhen Americans are asked to think about potential future impacts on society, opinions of AI remain mixed, at a nearly even split of respondents between positive, negative, and uncertain impacts. Respondents believe that things like solar energy (70%), personalized medicine (57%), and nuclear energy (43%) will have positive future impacts, but are more skeptical of cryptocurrency (24% positive, 40% say it will have a negative impact) and self-driving cars (23% positive, 50% negative).\n\nWe also wanted to get a sense of how important Americans believe certain technologies to be. To provide some sense of perspective, we asked them to compare these new technologies to some they’re more familiar with. “Extremely important” corresponded to the steam engine and electricity, “moderately important” corresponded to the smartphone, and “not very” corresponded to the digital camera.\n\nWith these comparisons in mind, the median respondent puts AI on par with the invention of the smartphone. Only 7% believe that it’s more important than any other technology, with 16% of frequent AI users believing this, compared to just 5% of infrequent/nonusers.\n\nDespite uncertainty about AI’s overall importance, 70% of Americans say this technology will dramatically transform work, though they’re much less certain about the exact nature of this transformation. A plurality believes that it will make work easier (49%), but a majority believes that AI will bring down wages (55%), including pluralities or majorities across education, race, and partisanship. More respondents think it will hurt the economy (37%) than think it will decrease growth (29%), probably reflecting concern about wages. The perception that AI will replace human workers or outcompete them for jobs is a common one: 51% think AI will replace work done by humans, versus 33% who believe AI will supplement the work humans do. Service workers are especially convinced AI will replace (59%) rather than supplement (30%).\n\nA majority of Americans (56%) think that within 10 years, AI will be capable of performing most tasks that most people do at work. However, this drops significantly when respondents are asked about when AI will be able to do most tasks in their own job or field, with 43% thinking this will happen within 10 years, with no notable differences by educational attainment or work type. Customer service representatives are generally agreed to be replaceable within 10 years (64%), followed by accountants (56%) and manufacturing workers (54%). Fewer than 1 in 3 Americans think electricians, truck drivers, or doctors could be replaced by AI in the next 10 years.\n\nAround two-thirds of Americans (67%) are more concerned about the government doing too little to regulate the dangers of AI, versus doing too much and stifling progress (12%). At the same time, they don’t support a full ban on AI advancement, preferring progress to continue with requirements for safety testing (62%). Americans’ preference for safety regulations over the fastest possible progress holds even when they’re presented with the idea that regulating AI would put the U.S. behind China: Only 15% prefer a world where the U.S. government doesn’t regulate AI at all to compete with other countries like China over one where AI research continues under regulation, even if it develops slower than other countries (67%).\n\nEven in the most extreme case — presenting the choice between no further progress in AI at all and totally unregulated AI — only 34% would support unregulated AI development, versus 30% who think the government should ban research to improve AI, with a 36% plurality saying they’re unsure.\n\nIn terms of perceived dangers from AI, Americans’ biggest concern is AI taking jobs and causing unemployment (42%), followed by concerns about privacy (35%) and misinformation (33%). These are also the top three areas Americans prioritize for regulation. Respondents are not especially concerned about AI wiping out humanity (12%), but express greater concern about the use of AI resulting in loss of human control (32%).\n\nWhile respondents see AI as better than humans at being “efficient” by a wide margin (+44 points), AI has virtually no advantage on “being convenient to those they’re trying to help” (+2). Humans are still seen as wildly better in terms of being moral (+53), making complex decisions (+30), protecting privacy (+28), and being transparent (+18).\n\nWe also asked about the potential for replacing humans in specific governmental tasks, since this has been talked up by some AI proponents. There are only two specific tasks (from our list tested in this survey, at least) where AI is seen as better than human government employees. One is identifying trends in data (+18) and the other is correctly verifying the information in forms (+8).\n\nOn anything less concrete and data-focused, respondents strongly prefer humans. Human government employees are preferred over AI by 77 points for judging criminal trials, by 59 points for conducting airport screenings, and by 55 points for answering questions about government services like Social Security. Public interest in AI replacement of humans in government and other tasks is minimal.\n\nThis survey was run by Tavern Research via an online sample of 2,301 American adults fielded over web panels from August 1, 2025 to August 6, 2025. The margin of error is +/- 3%.\n\nNOTE: Because this is a web-based survey, we expect the total usage of AI to be slightly higher than the numbers found in non-web-based surveys. This should not affect the other conclusions.\n\nA question that was interesting, but didn’t lead to a larger conclusion, was asking what actually happens when you ask a tool like ChatGPT a question. 45% think it looks up an exact answer in a database, and 21% think it follows a script of prewritten responses.",

    "description": "As a parent, self-regulation is hard — especially when things feel out of control. As someone who studies this, here's how I'm working to improve.",
    "fullText": "As someone who researches self-regulation for a living, it's a little ironic to admit that I can really struggle with regulating my emotions as a parent.\n\nOver the past few months, I've been writing a book about improving young children's self-regulation. I've read through a ton of research, written many chapters, and published papers on this very topic, but when my 3-year-old purposely dumps water on the floor, my initial response is to yell.\n\nBut, after all that research, I've discovered two things to be true: my 3-year-old needs more help developing his self-regulation — and so do I. Even with all of my knowledge in this area, I have found it challenging to follow my own advice, especially when things get stressful at home.\n\nClinically speaking, self-regulation is the ability to regulate your behaviors and emotions, which can include quickly shifting your attention away from what you are doing to another task (cooking dinner and managing your toddler's behavior) as well as trying to suppress an action that you know is inappropriate (harsh tones or yelling) and replacing it with a better action (calmly talking).\n\nI've noticed that I especially struggle with shifting my attention, which has become even harder since we recently welcomed our second son into our family. With two kids, my attention is being pulled in several different directions now, which makes completing simple tasks ever harder.\n\nI may try to clean up after dinner, while my 3-year-old is demanding that he wants to go outside with me instead of my wife, and my baby is covered in food, and there's double the noise. This significantly increases the demands on my own self-regulation, and has led to my struggling to keep a calm tone with my energetic 3-year-old.\n\nProfessionally, I know the greatest gift I can give my sons is being a well-regulated father. What we model in the home is critically important in our children's development. Research indicates that when parents exhibit anxious behavior, children are more likely to develop anxiety. The same is true for modeling physical activity, healthy eating habits, and cell phone use. How we parent our children is related to how they develop self-regulation. Even with the knowledge that my struggles with self-regulation can be directly linked to my sons' development, it's still been a struggle to make changes in my behavior.\n\nThere are many ways to help develop self-regulation in young children, like through free play and games. The games you played as a child, such as Red Light, Green Light, have been shown to help develop these regulatory skills. Your child's ability to stop when they want to keep going is the same skill they'll need in real-life situations, like pausing instead of running away from you at the store.\n\nThere are a few things I am doing to try to manage my own regulation. First, I am trying to build awareness of when and where I am feeling the most frustrated throughout the day. For me, that usually ends up being when we need to get out the door in the morning and at dinner time. To help, my wife and I have brainstormed ways to change our routines, which have helped reduce frustrations all around.\n\nThese frustrating moments, of course, are a recurring part of family life. In these moments, like when our children refuse to sleep, I have tried to make deep breathing a key first step in calming my body.\n\nI have also started to self-talk, using my inner monologue to remind myself that my kids will eventually fall asleep; they just need a little support. That awareness has been very helpful.\n\nFinally, I have started incorporating more regular cardio into my routine, which was challenging to do with the limited time I have in my day, but it has been worth it. Through activating different parts of the brain, cardio has been shown to enhance self-regulation, improve mood, and reduce stress. I almost always feel better after a sweat session.\n\nAll of these strategies are helping me stay more engaged and present with my kids. As they continue to grow, I want to show them that I, too, can work and improve my own behavior, just as we are asking them to. Being more thoughtful and purposeful with self-regulation has led to a happier and calmer home, and who doesn't want that?",

    "fullText": "The US economy is pumped up on tech-bro vanity. The inevitable correction must prompt a global conversation about intelligent machines, regulation and risk\n\nIf AI did not change your life in 2025, next year it will. That is one of few forecasts that can be made with confidence in unpredictable times. This is not an invitation to believe the hype about what the technology can do today, or may one day achieve. The hype doesn’t need your credence. It is puffed up enough on Silicon Valley finance to distort the global economy and fuel geopolitical rivalries, shaping your world regardless of whether the most fanciful claims about AI capability are ever realised.\n\nChatGPT was launched just over three years ago and became the fastest-growing consumer app in history. Now it has about 800m weekly users. Its parent company, OpenAI, is valued at about $500bn. Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, has negotiated an intricate and, to some eyes, suspiciously opaque network of deals with other players in the sector to build the infrastructure required for the US’s AI-powered future. The value of these commitments is about $1.5tn. This is not real cash, but bear in mind that a person spending $1 every second would need 31,700 years to get through a trillion-dollar stash.\n\nAlphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple, Meta (formerly Facebook) and Microsoft, which has a $135bn stake in OpenAI, are all piling hundreds of billions of dollars on the same bet. Without all these investments, the US economy would be flatlining.\n\nEconomic analysts and historians of previous industrial frenzies, from the 19th-century railroads to the dotcom boom-and-bust at the turn of the millennium, are calling AI a bubble.\n\nAltman has said: “There are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now.” Not his part, naturally. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, has called it a bubble, but the “good” kind that accelerates economic progress. A good bubble, in this analysis, finances infrastructure and expands the boundaries of human knowledge. These benefits endure after the bubble bursts and justify the ruin of people (little people, not Bezos people) who get hurt along the way.\n\nThe bullishness of the tech fraternity is a heady mix of old-fashioned hucksterism, plutocratic megalomania and utopian ideology.\n\nAt its core is a marketing pitch: current AI models already out-perform people at many tasks. Soon, it is supposed, the machines will achieve “general intelligence” – cognitive versatility like ours – leading to emancipation from the need for any human input. Generally, intelligent AI can teach itself and design its successors, advancing through mind-boggling exponents of capability towards higher dimensions of super-intelligence.\n\nThe company that crosses that threshold will have no trouble covering its debts. The men who realise this vision – and the dominant evangelists are all men – will be to omniscient AI what ancient prophets were to their gods. That’s a good gig for them. What happens to the rest of us in this post-sapiens order is a bit hazier.\n\nThe US isn’t the only superpower to have an interest in AI, so the Silicon Valley dash for maximum awesomeness has geopolitical implications. China has taken a different approach, dictated in part by the Communist party tradition of centralised industrial planning, but also by the simple fact of running second in the race to innovate. Beijing is pushing for a faster, wider implementation of lower-spec (but still powerful) AI at every level of the economy and society. China is betting on a general boost from ordinary AI. The US is gunning for an extraordinary leap in general AI.\n\nSince the prize in that race is global supremacy, there are few incentives for either side to fret about risks, or Neither the US nor China is interested in submitting a strategically vital industry to standards co-written with foreigners.\n\nIn the absence of global governance, we will depend on the integrity of robber barons and authoritarian apparatchiks to build ethical guardrails around systems already being embedded in tools we use for work, play and education.\n\nEarlier this year, Elon Musk announced that his company was developing Baby Grok, an AI chatbot aimed at children as young as three. The adult version has voiced white supremacist views and proudly self-identified as “MechaHitler”. That flagrancy has at least the virtue of candour. It is easier to spot than the subtler encodings of prejudice in bots that haven’t been given the kind of hard ideological steers that Musk gives his algorithms.\n\nNot all AI systems are large language models (LLMs) like Grok. But all LLMs are vulnerable to hallucinations and delusions gleaned from the material on which they are trained. They don’t “understand” a question and “think” about it like a conscious mind. They take a prompt, test the probability of its key terms occurring frequently together in their training data and assemble a plausible-sounding answer. Often the result is accurate. Usually it is convincing. It can also be garbage. As the volume of AI-generated content grows online, the ratio of slop to quality in the LLMs’ diets shifts accordingly. Fed on junk, they cannot be trusted to disgorge nutritious information.\n\nOn this trajectory a bleak destination comes into view: a synthetic pseudo-reality mediated by the sycophantic mechanical offspring of narcissist Silicon Valley oligarchs. But that isn’t the only available path. Nor is it necessarily the likeliest one. The irrational exuberance of the AI boosters and their cynical coupling with the Trump administration is a familiar story of human greed and myopia, not a new stage in evolution. The product is truly phenomenal but flawed in ways that encode the deformed character of its progenitors, whose talents are salesmanship and financial engineering. They have built spectacular engines that prioritise a brilliant performance of intelligence over the real thing.\n\nThe real bubble is not stock valuations but the inflated ego of an industry that thinks it is just one more datacentre away from computational divinity. When the correction comes, when the US’s Icarus economy hits the cold sea, there will be a chance for other voices to be heard on the subject of risk and regulation. It may not come in 2026, but the moment is nearing when the starkness of the choice on offer and the need to confront it becomes unavoidable. Should we build a world where AI is put to the service of humanity, or will it be the other way round? We won’t need ChatGPT to tell us the answer.\n\nRafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

    "fullText": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Federal regulators will allow tech companies to effectively plug massive data centers directly into power plants, issuing a long-awaited order Thursday, as the Trump administration urges it to help the U.S. lead the world in artificial intelligence and revive domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's unanimous order is designed to clear up pressing issues around so-called “colocation” agreements in the nation's largest grid territory, which stretches across mid-Atlantic states to parts of Illinois and Indiana.\n\nBut it could become a blueprint for how FERC handles an October request from Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, to ensure that data centers and large manufacturers get the power they need as quickly as possible.\n\nIt also comes amid concerns that the mid-Atlantic territory covering some 65 million people will face electricity shortages in the coming years, as the build out of data centers outpaces the speed of new power sources coming online.\n\nLaura Swett, FERC’s chair, told Thursday's meeting that clearing the way for massive energy users — like data centers — to get electricity straight from power plants was a “critical step to give investors and consumers more certainty on how FERC believes we can solve the problem of meeting historic surging demand and realize our greatest potential as a country.”\n\nIt would, she said, also protect regular ratepayers, even as evidence mounts in various states that regular ratepayers are bearing the cost of new power plants and transmission lines to feed energy hungry data centers.\n\nPower plant owners applauded the step, as their share prices rose steeply in Thursday's trading. Advanced Energy United, whose members provide solar and wind power, said the FERC order should help clarify how big power users can set up their own power sources.\n\nThe Edison Electric Institute, which represents for-profit utilities, said only that it would “continue to work” to support rapid data center connection, protect ratepayers from cost-shifts and strengthen the grid for everyone.\n\nJeff Dennis, executive director of the Electricity Customer Alliance, said the order showed that FERC is trying to address looming issues around fast-growing power demand and underscored the urgency to reform grid policy.\n\nThursday's order grew out of a dispute between power plant owners and electric utilities over a proposed colocation deal between Amazon’s cloud-computing subsidiary and the owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.\n\nFor tech giants, such arrangements represent a quick fix to quickly get power while avoiding a potentially longer and more expensive process of hooking into a fraying electric grid that serves everyone else.\n\nBut utilities protested that it allows big power users to avoid paying them to maintain the grid. Some consumer advocates maintained that diverting energy from existing power plants to data centers could drive up energy prices without an answer for how rising power demand will be met for regular ratepayers.\n\nFERC's Thursday order sets up a couple new regulatory tracks.\n\nIt requires the operator of the mid-Atlantic grid, PJM Interconnection, to develop rates and conditions for different colocation scenarios involving new power plants or sources.\n\nThat could mean allowing a big power user to pay for only the transmission services they use, considerably less than they might otherwise pay to connect to the grid through a utility.\n\nThe order also could require a big power user that colocates with an existing power plant to pay the cost to replace the energy that it diverts away from the broader electric grid.\n\nFollow Marc Levy on X at https://x.com/timelywriter.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge on Wednesday blocked Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 's attempt to shut down an aging oil pipeline running beneath a channel linking two of the Great Lakes, finding that only the federal government can regulate interstate pipeline safety.\n\nWhitmer, a Democrat, ordered regulators in 2020 to revoke an easement that allows Enbridge Inc. to operate a 4.5-mile (6.4) kilometer pipeline segment under the Straits of Mackinac, which link Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Whitmer made the move out of concern that the 72-year-old pipeline could rupture and cause a catastrophic spill.\n\nEnbridge filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block the revocation and the pipeline continues to operate. President Donald Trump's administration argued in filings this year that Whitmer's order interferes with U.S. foreign energy policy and that only the federal government, not the states, can regulate pipeline safety. The pipeline segment, known as Line 5, moves crude oil between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario.\n\nU.S. District Judge Robert Jonker wrote in an opinion that revoking the easement would effectively shut down Line 5. He found that Congress expressly prohibited states from regulating interstate pipeline safety in the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992. He also noted that the United States and Canada agree that Michigan's attempt to shut down the pipeline interferes with their federal foreign policy positions and trade relations.\n\n“An oil spill in Michigan's Great Lakes would undoubtedly be an environmental catastrophe. And Michigan would undoubtedly be the recipient of almost all the environmental damage that would result,” Jonker wrote. “But for better or worse, the national government has unequivocally decided to displace state power in this area and assume exclusive responsibility for interstate pipeline safety.”\n\nA message seeking comment was left for a spokesperson for Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, whose office represented Whitmer's administration in the lawsuit. A Whitmer spokesperson referred questions to Nessel.\n\nEnbridge issued a statement saying the line is safe and that Jonker's ruling protects both the United States and Canada from “significant energy disruptions.”\n\nMultiple other legal challenges are swirling around Line 5 in Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nNessel filed her own action in 2019 seeking to void the easement in the straits. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently weighing whether that case belongs in state or federal court. And a number of environmental groups and tribes have sued challenging state permits authorizing Enbridge's plan to build a protective tunnel around the straits segment. That case is pending before the Michigan state Supreme Court.\n\nIn Wisconsin, a federal judge ruled in 2023 that Enbridge must remove a section of Line 5 that runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa's reservation. The company has proposed a 41-mile (66-kilometer) route around the reservation, but the tribe and environmentalists say construction could harm the environment and the new route would still leave the region vulnerable to a spill.\n\nThe Bad River has sued in state court seeking to void state permits for the project; that case is still pending. The tribe along with a number of environmental groups also is challenging the permits through the state's contested case process, a proceeding similar to a lawsuit that will culminate with an administrative law judge's ruling.\n\nThe tribe filed a federal lawsuit on Tuesday in Washington, D.C., challenging U.S. Army Corps of Engineer permits authorizing the reroute.",

    "title": "Netflix's bid to buy Warner Bros. hinges on a key question: Who does it actually compete with?",
    "description": "Netflix and Warner Bros. have a deal, but regulators must approve the move. The question of how to define Netflix's market is a major consideration.",
    "fullText": "Would buying Warner Bros. give Netflix too much power?\n\nThe streaming giant is telling regulators it won't, and antitrust experts say the answer ultimately depends on how you define who Netflix competes with.\n\nDoes Netflix compete with only paid streaming services, a market where it dominates? What about the TV dinosaurs it disrupted, or the social video services nipping at its heels? Could sleep even be a competitor, as its cofounder Reed Hastings famously suggested?\n\nRival suitor Paramount Skydance has slammed the Netflix-Warner Bros. mega-deal as anticompetitive, arguing that it would harm consumers and Hollywood talent. Netflix is by far the largest paid subscription video streamer, and it would become even stronger with the addition of WBD's studio assets, including HBO and the Warner Bros. library (stocked with fare like Harry Potter and DC Comics).\n\nNetflix, for its part, is advocating for a definition that considers total US TV viewing time. The streamer, which has expressed confidence in its regulatory case, pointed to this in a letter to its employees on Monday.\n\n\"Even after combining with Warner Bros., our view share would only move from 8% to 9% in the US — still well behind YouTube (13%) and a potential Paramount/WBD combination (14%),\" Netflix's co-CEOs wrote on Monday, citing Nielsen data. A Netflix spokesperson referred to those remarks when asked for comment.\n\nConvincing antitrust regulators of that could be an uphill battle.\n\n\"Antitrust regulators are likely to define the relevant market narrowly,\" said Anthony Palomba, a business professor at the University of Virginia. \"The FTC and DOJ have consistently treated streaming as a discrete competitive arena, separate from linear television, theatrical distribution, or social video platforms.\"\n\nThe president has said the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal \"could be a problem.\"\n\n\"They have a very big market share, and when they have Warner Brothers, you know, that share goes up a lot,\" he said of Netflix.\n\nReuben Miller, the head of antitrust at financial data service Dealreporter, said Netflix's bid would \"be challenged and litigated unless Netflix can convince Trump to come down on their side.\"\n\nHere's how regulators could determine Netflix's competitive market and, by extension, the future of the media business.\n\nA Netflix-Warner Bros. combination would be a colossus. Netflix and HBO Max have accounted for 39% of US paid subscription streaming revenue in 2025, per S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nAny firm with 30% to 40% market share has historically drawn scrutiny from the US government. If regulators see paid streamers as a distinct market, Netflix's Warner Bros. deal could be in trouble.\n\nConsumers may not view social media apps — even when they are watched on a TV screen — as close substitutes for Netflix, Disney+, or Hulu, Palomba said. If so, a Netflix-HBO Max combination could limit choice or lead to price hikes.\n\nThere are few recent parallels to Netflix's Warner Bros. acquisition, Dealreporter's Miller said. One could be Charter Communications, which was allowed to expand its cable operation in 2016, though streamers were in their early days then. Miller said it felt like the government was protecting the nascent streaming industry. However, consumer behavior has changed so dramatically since then that he's unsure if those market definitions would be applicable.\n\n\"The incentive is to start with the assumption that a merger is illegal,\" Miller added. \"They're going to start with as narrow a definition as possible, so they'll probably start with paid streaming. And then the onus is on Netflix to try and get them to expand that market definition.\"\n\nAlthough Netflix is easily the most viewed paid streamer in the US, it's not the top streamer on TV screens.\n\nThat would be free YouTube, whose viewership share has soared relative to Netflix in recent years. At the end of 2022, Netflix and YouTube each commanded 7.5% of viewership on US TVs. But as of October, YouTube had a 12.9% share while Netflix took second place at 8%, according to Nielsen.\n\nAlong with its paid peers, Netflix is also battling free streamers like The Roku Channel and Fox's Tubi that are popular among Gen Z.\n\nWhen adding free streamers into the marketplace, Netflix and HBO Max together accounted for just over a fifth of US streaming minutes in October, MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote on Monday. While 20% share is powerhouse status, it might not be a dealbreaker from an antitrust perspective.\n\nNetflix has argued that it's competing against all of traditional TV, not just streamers.\n\nIts viewership share ranks sixth among TV media distributors, versus its second-place spot in streaming. When measured against cable and broadcast TV, Netflix's 8% share in October was slightly behind the 8.2% share for Paramount, which includes its cable channels and CBS.\n\nAnd since Netflix isn't trying to buy WBD's cable networks like CNN, it could argue that it's only adding a fraction of the media conglomerate's viewership time.\n\nNetflix would undoubtedly love a broad definition of its competitive market that includes TikTok, Instagram, and even video podcasts and video games, which are also spaces where the streamer competes.\n\nSome media insiders see an ultra-broad competitive landscape as a bridge too far.\n\n\"My clients are not pitching shows to YouTube,\" a TV agent said.\n\nCorey Martin of LA-based law firm Granderson Des Rochers said that \"to compare Netflix to YouTube, or even TikTok, is like comparing apples and oranges.\" He said the same applied to video games.\n\nConsumers tend to think of paid streamers like Netflix or Disney+ when they want to watch movies, TV, or sports, Martin said, but \"they don't necessarily think about YouTube or TikTok.\"\n\n\"Directly, it's hard to say that a video game is competing with a movie, or a video game is competing with the TV, even though they do consume our attention,\" said Rahul Telang, a business professor at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nHowever, some see truth in the idea of an all-consuming battle for attention.\n\nBernstein analyst Laurent Yoon said Netflix may be a leader in long-form video, but others have better sports offerings. Yoon also wrote in a mid-December note that attention has shifted to short-form video on Instagram and TikTok, and even new micro dramas.\n\n\"Critics may claim these are apples and oranges, but we heard the same argument about linear vs. streaming only a decade ago,\" Yoon wrote.",

    "fullText": "PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Regulators voted Thursday to extend a shutdown preventing New England fishermen from catching shrimp, a historic industry that has recently fallen victim to warming oceans.\n\nNew England fishermen, especially those from Maine, used to catch millions of pounds of small pink shrimp in the winter, but the business has been under a fishing moratorium since 2014. Rising temperatures have created an inhospitable environment for the shrimp, and their population is too low to fish sustainably, scientists have said.\n\nAn arm of the regulatory Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission voted Thursday to shut down the fishery for at least another three years. Abundance of the shrimp remained “poor” this year despite slightly improved environmental conditions, the Atlantic States said in documents.\n\nThe decision came after shrimp harvesters were allowed to catch a small number of shrimp as part of an industry-funded sampling and data collection program. The fishermen, who battled some rough weather, caught only 70 shrimp totaling less than 3 pounds.\n\nHowever, \"even with the bad weather, exceptionally low catch levels observed throughout the program reinforce concerns about the viability of the northern shrimp stock in the Gulf of Maine,” the documents state.\n\nNew England shrimp were a winter delicacy when the fishery was active, and fishermen sometimes caught more than 10 million pounds (4,536 kilograms) of them in a year. The small pink shrimp were a small part of the country's large wild caught shrimp industry, which catches some of the most valuable seafood in the world.\n\nMaine's catch of shrimp cratered in 2013, when fishermen caught less than 600,000 pounds (272,155 kilograms) of the crustaceans after hauling more than eight times that the previous year. Fishing groups have sometimes lobbied for the shrimping industry to be reopened on a smaller scale basis, but most former Maine shrimpers have moved on to other species.",

    "fullText": "Dec 9 (Reuters) - Beijing is set to limit access to Nvidia's advanced H200 chips despite U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to allow the ​export of the technology to China, the Financial Times reported on ‌Tuesday, citing two people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nRegulators in Beijing have been discussing ways to ‌permit limited access to the H200, Nvidia's second-best generation of artificial intelligence chips, according to the report.\n\nSuch a move would add a hurdle to Nvidia and other top U.S. chipmakers' ability to address the China market, after Trump's Monday announcement appeared ⁠to settle a debate over ‌whether these companies should keep their global lead by selling AI chips to China or withhold shipments.\n\nNvidia shares, which had risen ‍as much as 2% in premarket trading, pared gains after the report and were last up about 0.6%. The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for ​comment on the report.\n\nBeijing has been pushing back against domestic firms' use of ‌U.S. technology, especially Nvidia chips, as it retaliates against American restrictions.\n\nEarlier U.S. restrictions banned the sale of advanced AI processors to China, weighing on Nvidia's ability to grow in one of the world's largest markets for AI chips and development.\n\nThe export of the H200 chips will be permitted with a 25% fee levied ⁠on such sales, Trump said in a ​post on Truth Social on Monday.\n\nIpek Ozkardeskaya, senior ​analyst at Swissquote Bank, said the approval alone may have limited impact on Nvidia's business in China unless it is allowed to ‍export other chip ⁠lines such as Blackwell or Rubin.\n\nShares of AMD and Intel also pared gains and were last up about 0.3% in premarket trading. So far ⁠this year, Nvidia has gained nearly 40% compared with the S&P 500 benchmark index's 16.4% rise ‌in the same period.",

    "fullText": "The Avs had an opportunity to be the first team to 50 points tonight, but ultimately, they drop their second loss of the road trip in the shootout to the Nashville Predators 4-3, finishing their east coast trip 2-1-1.\n\nBrock Nelson starts out the scoring with a beautiful deke and a shot that cracks Jusse Saros early. Unfortunately, Scott Wedgewood, in his first game back has a few not-so-good bounces that lead to goals. Jonathan Marchessault capitalizes on a poorly-tracked puck, and Reid Schaefer catches a stagnant Wedgewood to find the league.\n\nArtturi Lehkonen keeps the Avs from heading into the first intermission down and ties it up to make it 2-2 heading into the second period.\n\nA second period that ends scoreless, a ‘no goals’ commercial come to life. The Avs drew a few power plays, but nothing comes of them, and they head into the third on a split power play.\n\nThe third period goes scoreless until just above the seven-minute mark. Wedgewood looks much better in this period, making the first initial saves, but the Preds get it back out high and Brady Skjei finds a lane through traffic (thanks to an unfortunate screen from Sam Malinski) to put Nashville back in the lead.\n\nFear not, with eight seconds left, Cale Makar finds his first goal on the power play in a while, and they grab a point out of a game that they maybe didn’t deserve to.\n\nOvertime is scoreless, but Ryan O’Reilly scores first in the shootout, and he’ll be the lone shootout scorer to push Nashville to win 4-3.\n\nI think he picked up his performance as the game went on, and there’s certainly a conversation to be had about defensive coverage…\n\nBut as far as routine saves go, seems like the two Nashville scored in the first were fairly textbook.\n\nIf at first you don't score, shoot again! pic.twitter.com/hjh5tISYc4\n\n— Nashville Predators (@PredsNHL) December 10, 2025\n\nAnd I get it, right. This is Wedgewood’s first game back since his injury (back tightness per Coach Jared Bednar). Totally fine, especially considering he earned this game back a bit with his performance in the third period. But if you track the puck on the first goal better and lateral movement isn’t nonexistent on the second goal, this game is infinitely easier for the Avs.\n\nDoesn’t help that concussion spotters pull him after Filip Forsberg’s shootout attempt… So, the Avs may have another Wedgewood injury to worry about.\n\nI mean, Cale Makar finally getting his first power play goal since April 3rd, 2025 is an accomplishment, sure. That’s also a goal at 6-on-4, so I’m not counting that one (as pretty as it might be).\n\n8 WITH 8 SECONDS TO GO🥬 pic.twitter.com/iiKIgWeFQ2\n\n— Colorado Avalanche (@Avalanche) December 10, 2025\n\nThis game has an entirely different identity if the Avs can convert on one of the three 5-on-4 opportunities they had in the second period.\n\nI’m not even sure what has to change, except for maybe putting more than just seven shots on goal in six minutes of having a man-advantage.\n\nUltimately, it’s the power play that saves them, but with the third-period lull, you have to get more out of your units in a game like this.",

It marked the 15th day in league history to feature a pair of game-tying goals within the final 15 seconds of regulation, and fourth in the past decade, according to the NHL.\n\nThe Islanders finished 2-0 against the Golden Knights this season.
