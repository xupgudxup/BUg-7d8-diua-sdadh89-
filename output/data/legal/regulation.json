    "fullText": "State department accuses group of pressuring tech firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints through regulation of disinformation\n\nThe state department has barred five Europeans from the US, accusing them of leading efforts to pressure tech firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints, in the latest attack on European regulations that target hate speech and misinformation.\n\nSecretary of state Marco Rubio said the five people targeted with visa bans – who include former European Commissioner Thierry Breton – have led “organized efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetize, and suppress American viewpoints they oppose.”\n\n“These radical activists and weaponized NGOs have advanced censorship crackdowns by foreign states – in each case targeting American speakers and American companies,” Rubio said in an announcement.\n\nIn recent months, Trump officials have ordered US diplomats to build opposition to the European Union’s landmark Digital Services Act (DSA), which is intended to combat hateful speech, misinformation and disinformation, but which Washington says stifles free speech and imposes costs on US tech companies.\n\nLate on Tuesday night, Breton posted on social media: “Is McCarthy’s witch hunt back?”\n\nTuesday’s move is part of a Trump administration campaign against foreign influence over online speech, using immigration law rather than platform regulations or sanctions. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, those targeted will generally be barred from entering the US, and some may face removal proceedings if already in the country.\n\nRubio did not name those targeted, but under secretary for public diplomacy Sarah Rogers identified them on X, accusing the individuals of “fomenting censorship of American speech”.\n\nThe five named were: Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate; Josephine Ballon and Anna-Lena von Hodenberg, leaders of HateAid, a German organization; Clare Melford, who runs the Global Disinformation Index’; and former EU commissioner Breton.\n\nThe visa bans come after the administration’s National Security Strategy this month said European leaders were censoring free speech and suppressing opposition to immigration policies that it said risk “civilisational erasure” for the continent.\n\nRogers called Breton – who served as the European Commissioner for the internal market from 2019-2024 – “a mastermind” of the DSA.\n\nMelford, co-founder of the Global Disinformation Index (GDI), said in a video posted online in 2024 that she co-founded the organisation “to try to break the business model of harmful online content” by reviewing online news websites to allow advertisers to “choose whether or not they want to fund content that is polarising and divisive and harmful, or whether they want to steer their advertising back towards more quality journalism.”\n\nA spokesperson for GDI called the US action “immoral, unlawful, and un-American” and “an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship.”\n\nMost Europeans are covered by the Visa Waiver Program, which means they don’t necessarily need visas to come into the US. They do, however, need to complete an online application prior to arrival under a system run by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), so it is possible that at least some of these five people have been flagged to DHS, a US official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss details not publicly released.\n\nWith Reuters, the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse",

    "title": "Americans Have Mixed Views of AI – and an Appetite for Regulation",
    "description": "A supermajority of Americans say that AI should be regulated to protect privacy and ensure safety.",
    "fullText": "AI is sweeping the American economy. A majority of Americans are either using AI tools or have tried them. But AI use is only half the story – a supermajority of Americans say that AI should be regulated to protect privacy and ensure safety. And many remain worried about potential job losses stemming from the emerging technology. \n\nIt’s time we did more to understand the national attitudes around AI use, regulation, and favorability.\n\nMost of our respondents had used AI at least once: 58% report using or trying AI, specifically tools like ChatGPT or Claude, divided evenly between fairly regular users (30% use at least a few times a month) and more infrequent users (29% have used AI, but only once a month or less). Nonusers are more likely to be older (62% of people over 65 have never used AI), not have gone to college (47%), or to work in service jobs (35%). Only 18% of white-collar workers say they have never used AI.\n\nAmong those who do use AI, 63% have at least tried it out for work purposes, and 34% report using it at work consistently (a few times a month or more). Work usage, like AI usage overall, is more common among white-collar workers, a majority of whom (55%) use it consistently. Personal use of AI is more common: 91% have at least tried using an AI chatbot or writing tool, and 54% report consistently using it in their personal lives. Gen Z turns to AI more often than its older counterparts, with 68% regularly engaging AI for personal use (compared to just 40% among Boomers).\n\nPersonal AI use encompasses a bunch of different types of application, but by far the most common is information gathering and answering questions (63%). Frequent AI users are especially likely to use AI as an alternative to traditional Google search or other research tools (68%). If this use case continues, messaging and communication on anything from public health to election campaigns will be filtered through AI models before reaching people. This could potentially change how messages are interpreted (particularly given the use of AI summaries), or significantly alter their reach in difficult-to-measure ways. Those interested in talking effectively to Americans should consider how their messaging strategy would work with these AI intermediaries, how their messages will be interpreted by AI, and if what they say will still reach their intended audience.\n\nWhile they know the names of the tools (ChatGPT, etc.), respondents don’t know much about the companies responsible for AI products. This is in contrast with older tech companies: Only 5% haven’t heard of Google, and 79% are favorable toward the company. For Amazon, favorability is at 80%. When asked about OpenAI, 42% hadn’t heard enough to form an opinion. For Anthropic, this figure hit 81%.\n\nAmericans don’t view AI as favorably as other emerging technologies from the past quarter century. Cell phones (76% total positive; net +68), the internet (75% total positive; net +66), and solar energy (72% total positive; net +65) are all viewed as having a very positive impact on society. AI (38% total positive; net +8) is \n\nWhen Americans are asked to think about potential future impacts on society, opinions of AI remain mixed, at a nearly even split of respondents between positive, negative, and uncertain impacts. Respondents believe that things like solar energy (70%), personalized medicine (57%), and nuclear energy (43%) will have positive future impacts, but are more skeptical of cryptocurrency (24% positive, 40% say it will have a negative impact) and self-driving cars (23% positive, 50% negative).\n\nWe also wanted to get a sense of how important Americans believe certain technologies to be. To provide some sense of perspective, we asked them to compare these new technologies to some they’re more familiar with. “Extremely important” corresponded to the steam engine and electricity, “moderately important” corresponded to the smartphone, and “not very” corresponded to the digital camera.\n\nWith these comparisons in mind, the median respondent puts AI on par with the invention of the smartphone. Only 7% believe that it’s more important than any other technology, with 16% of frequent AI users believing this, compared to just 5% of infrequent/nonusers.\n\nDespite uncertainty about AI’s overall importance, 70% of Americans say this technology will dramatically transform work, though they’re much less certain about the exact nature of this transformation. A plurality believes that it will make work easier (49%), but a majority believes that AI will bring down wages (55%), including pluralities or majorities across education, race, and partisanship. More respondents think it will hurt the economy (37%) than think it will decrease growth (29%), probably reflecting concern about wages. The perception that AI will replace human workers or outcompete them for jobs is a common one: 51% think AI will replace work done by humans, versus 33% who believe AI will supplement the work humans do. Service workers are especially convinced AI will replace (59%) rather than supplement (30%).\n\nA majority of Americans (56%) think that within 10 years, AI will be capable of performing most tasks that most people do at work. However, this drops significantly when respondents are asked about when AI will be able to do most tasks in their own job or field, with 43% thinking this will happen within 10 years, with no notable differences by educational attainment or work type. Customer service representatives are generally agreed to be replaceable within 10 years (64%), followed by accountants (56%) and manufacturing workers (54%). Fewer than 1 in 3 Americans think electricians, truck drivers, or doctors could be replaced by AI in the next 10 years.\n\nAround two-thirds of Americans (67%) are more concerned about the government doing too little to regulate the dangers of AI, versus doing too much and stifling progress (12%). At the same time, they don’t support a full ban on AI advancement, preferring progress to continue with requirements for safety testing (62%). Americans’ preference for safety regulations over the fastest possible progress holds even when they’re presented with the idea that regulating AI would put the U.S. behind China: Only 15% prefer a world where the U.S. government doesn’t regulate AI at all to compete with other countries like China over one where AI research continues under regulation, even if it develops slower than other countries (67%).\n\nEven in the most extreme case — presenting the choice between no further progress in AI at all and totally unregulated AI — only 34% would support unregulated AI development, versus 30% who think the government should ban research to improve AI, with a 36% plurality saying they’re unsure.\n\nIn terms of perceived dangers from AI, Americans’ biggest concern is AI taking jobs and causing unemployment (42%), followed by concerns about privacy (35%) and misinformation (33%). These are also the top three areas Americans prioritize for regulation. Respondents are not especially concerned about AI wiping out humanity (12%), but express greater concern about the use of AI resulting in loss of human control (32%).\n\nWhile respondents see AI as better than humans at being “efficient” by a wide margin (+44 points), AI has virtually no advantage on “being convenient to those they’re trying to help” (+2). Humans are still seen as wildly better in terms of being moral (+53), making complex decisions (+30), protecting privacy (+28), and being transparent (+18).\n\nWe also asked about the potential for replacing humans in specific governmental tasks, since this has been talked up by some AI proponents. There are only two specific tasks (from our list tested in this survey, at least) where AI is seen as better than human government employees. One is identifying trends in data (+18) and the other is correctly verifying the information in forms (+8).\n\nOn anything less concrete and data-focused, respondents strongly prefer humans. Human government employees are preferred over AI by 77 points for judging criminal trials, by 59 points for conducting airport screenings, and by 55 points for answering questions about government services like Social Security. Public interest in AI replacement of humans in government and other tasks is minimal.\n\nThis survey was run by Tavern Research via an online sample of 2,301 American adults fielded over web panels from August 1, 2025 to August 6, 2025. The margin of error is +/- 3%.\n\nNOTE: Because this is a web-based survey, we expect the total usage of AI to be slightly higher than the numbers found in non-web-based surveys. This should not affect the other conclusions.\n\nA question that was interesting, but didn’t lead to a larger conclusion, was asking what actually happens when you ask a tool like ChatGPT a question. 45% think it looks up an exact answer in a database, and 21% think it follows a script of prewritten responses.",

    "description": "As a parent, self-regulation is hard — especially when things feel out of control. As someone who studies this, here's how I'm working to improve.",
    "fullText": "As someone who researches self-regulation for a living, it's a little ironic to admit that I can really struggle with regulating my emotions as a parent.\n\nOver the past few months, I've been writing a book about improving young children's self-regulation. I've read through a ton of research, written many chapters, and published papers on this very topic, but when my 3-year-old purposely dumps water on the floor, my initial response is to yell.\n\nBut, after all that research, I've discovered two things to be true: my 3-year-old needs more help developing his self-regulation — and so do I. Even with all of my knowledge in this area, I have found it challenging to follow my own advice, especially when things get stressful at home.\n\nClinically speaking, self-regulation is the ability to regulate your behaviors and emotions, which can include quickly shifting your attention away from what you are doing to another task (cooking dinner and managing your toddler's behavior) as well as trying to suppress an action that you know is inappropriate (harsh tones or yelling) and replacing it with a better action (calmly talking).\n\nI've noticed that I especially struggle with shifting my attention, which has become even harder since we recently welcomed our second son into our family. With two kids, my attention is being pulled in several different directions now, which makes completing simple tasks ever harder.\n\nI may try to clean up after dinner, while my 3-year-old is demanding that he wants to go outside with me instead of my wife, and my baby is covered in food, and there's double the noise. This significantly increases the demands on my own self-regulation, and has led to my struggling to keep a calm tone with my energetic 3-year-old.\n\nProfessionally, I know the greatest gift I can give my sons is being a well-regulated father. What we model in the home is critically important in our children's development. Research indicates that when parents exhibit anxious behavior, children are more likely to develop anxiety. The same is true for modeling physical activity, healthy eating habits, and cell phone use. How we parent our children is related to how they develop self-regulation. Even with the knowledge that my struggles with self-regulation can be directly linked to my sons' development, it's still been a struggle to make changes in my behavior.\n\nThere are many ways to help develop self-regulation in young children, like through free play and games. The games you played as a child, such as Red Light, Green Light, have been shown to help develop these regulatory skills. Your child's ability to stop when they want to keep going is the same skill they'll need in real-life situations, like pausing instead of running away from you at the store.\n\nThere are a few things I am doing to try to manage my own regulation. First, I am trying to build awareness of when and where I am feeling the most frustrated throughout the day. For me, that usually ends up being when we need to get out the door in the morning and at dinner time. To help, my wife and I have brainstormed ways to change our routines, which have helped reduce frustrations all around.\n\nThese frustrating moments, of course, are a recurring part of family life. In these moments, like when our children refuse to sleep, I have tried to make deep breathing a key first step in calming my body.\n\nI have also started to self-talk, using my inner monologue to remind myself that my kids will eventually fall asleep; they just need a little support. That awareness has been very helpful.\n\nFinally, I have started incorporating more regular cardio into my routine, which was challenging to do with the limited time I have in my day, but it has been worth it. Through activating different parts of the brain, cardio has been shown to enhance self-regulation, improve mood, and reduce stress. I almost always feel better after a sweat session.\n\nAll of these strategies are helping me stay more engaged and present with my kids. As they continue to grow, I want to show them that I, too, can work and improve my own behavior, just as we are asking them to. Being more thoughtful and purposeful with self-regulation has led to a happier and calmer home, and who doesn't want that?",

    "fullText": "The US economy is pumped up on tech-bro vanity. The inevitable correction must prompt a global conversation about intelligent machines, regulation and risk\n\nIf AI did not change your life in 2025, next year it will. That is one of few forecasts that can be made with confidence in unpredictable times. This is not an invitation to believe the hype about what the technology can do today, or may one day achieve. The hype doesn’t need your credence. It is puffed up enough on Silicon Valley finance to distort the global economy and fuel geopolitical rivalries, shaping your world regardless of whether the most fanciful claims about AI capability are ever realised.\n\nChatGPT was launched just over three years ago and became the fastest-growing consumer app in history. Now it has about 800m weekly users. Its parent company, OpenAI, is valued at about $500bn. Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, has negotiated an intricate and, to some eyes, suspiciously opaque network of deals with other players in the sector to build the infrastructure required for the US’s AI-powered future. The value of these commitments is about $1.5tn. This is not real cash, but bear in mind that a person spending $1 every second would need 31,700 years to get through a trillion-dollar stash.\n\nAlphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple, Meta (formerly Facebook) and Microsoft, which has a $135bn stake in OpenAI, are all piling hundreds of billions of dollars on the same bet. Without all these investments, the US economy would be flatlining.\n\nEconomic analysts and historians of previous industrial frenzies, from the 19th-century railroads to the dotcom boom-and-bust at the turn of the millennium, are calling AI a bubble.\n\nAltman has said: “There are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now.” Not his part, naturally. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, has called it a bubble, but the “good” kind that accelerates economic progress. A good bubble, in this analysis, finances infrastructure and expands the boundaries of human knowledge. These benefits endure after the bubble bursts and justify the ruin of people (little people, not Bezos people) who get hurt along the way.\n\nThe bullishness of the tech fraternity is a heady mix of old-fashioned hucksterism, plutocratic megalomania and utopian ideology.\n\nAt its core is a marketing pitch: current AI models already out-perform people at many tasks. Soon, it is supposed, the machines will achieve “general intelligence” – cognitive versatility like ours – leading to emancipation from the need for any human input. Generally, intelligent AI can teach itself and design its successors, advancing through mind-boggling exponents of capability towards higher dimensions of super-intelligence.\n\nThe company that crosses that threshold will have no trouble covering its debts. The men who realise this vision – and the dominant evangelists are all men – will be to omniscient AI what ancient prophets were to their gods. That’s a good gig for them. What happens to the rest of us in this post-sapiens order is a bit hazier.\n\nThe US isn’t the only superpower to have an interest in AI, so the Silicon Valley dash for maximum awesomeness has geopolitical implications. China has taken a different approach, dictated in part by the Communist party tradition of centralised industrial planning, but also by the simple fact of running second in the race to innovate. Beijing is pushing for a faster, wider implementation of lower-spec (but still powerful) AI at every level of the economy and society. China is betting on a general boost from ordinary AI. The US is gunning for an extraordinary leap in general AI.\n\nSince the prize in that race is global supremacy, there are few incentives for either side to fret about risks, or Neither the US nor China is interested in submitting a strategically vital industry to standards co-written with foreigners.\n\nIn the absence of global governance, we will depend on the integrity of robber barons and authoritarian apparatchiks to build ethical guardrails around systems already being embedded in tools we use for work, play and education.\n\nEarlier this year, Elon Musk announced that his company was developing Baby Grok, an AI chatbot aimed at children as young as three. The adult version has voiced white supremacist views and proudly self-identified as “MechaHitler”. That flagrancy has at least the virtue of candour. It is easier to spot than the subtler encodings of prejudice in bots that haven’t been given the kind of hard ideological steers that Musk gives his algorithms.\n\nNot all AI systems are large language models (LLMs) like Grok. But all LLMs are vulnerable to hallucinations and delusions gleaned from the material on which they are trained. They don’t “understand” a question and “think” about it like a conscious mind. They take a prompt, test the probability of its key terms occurring frequently together in their training data and assemble a plausible-sounding answer. Often the result is accurate. Usually it is convincing. It can also be garbage. As the volume of AI-generated content grows online, the ratio of slop to quality in the LLMs’ diets shifts accordingly. Fed on junk, they cannot be trusted to disgorge nutritious information.\n\nOn this trajectory a bleak destination comes into view: a synthetic pseudo-reality mediated by the sycophantic mechanical offspring of narcissist Silicon Valley oligarchs. But that isn’t the only available path. Nor is it necessarily the likeliest one. The irrational exuberance of the AI boosters and their cynical coupling with the Trump administration is a familiar story of human greed and myopia, not a new stage in evolution. The product is truly phenomenal but flawed in ways that encode the deformed character of its progenitors, whose talents are salesmanship and financial engineering. They have built spectacular engines that prioritise a brilliant performance of intelligence over the real thing.\n\nThe real bubble is not stock valuations but the inflated ego of an industry that thinks it is just one more datacentre away from computational divinity. When the correction comes, when the US’s Icarus economy hits the cold sea, there will be a chance for other voices to be heard on the subject of risk and regulation. It may not come in 2026, but the moment is nearing when the starkness of the choice on offer and the need to confront it becomes unavoidable. Should we build a world where AI is put to the service of humanity, or will it be the other way round? We won’t need ChatGPT to tell us the answer.\n\nRafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

    "fullText": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Federal regulators will allow tech companies to effectively plug massive data centers directly into power plants, issuing a long-awaited order Thursday, as the Trump administration urges it to help the U.S. lead the world in artificial intelligence and revive domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's unanimous order is designed to clear up pressing issues around so-called “colocation” agreements in the nation's largest grid territory, which stretches across mid-Atlantic states to parts of Illinois and Indiana.\n\nBut it could become a blueprint for how FERC handles an October request from Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, to ensure that data centers and large manufacturers get the power they need as quickly as possible.\n\nIt also comes amid concerns that the mid-Atlantic territory covering some 65 million people will face electricity shortages in the coming years, as the build out of data centers outpaces the speed of new power sources coming online.\n\nLaura Swett, FERC’s chair, told Thursday's meeting that clearing the way for massive energy users — like data centers — to get electricity straight from power plants was a “critical step to give investors and consumers more certainty on how FERC believes we can solve the problem of meeting historic surging demand and realize our greatest potential as a country.”\n\nIt would, she said, also protect regular ratepayers, even as evidence mounts in various states that regular ratepayers are bearing the cost of new power plants and transmission lines to feed energy hungry data centers.\n\nPower plant owners applauded the step, as their share prices rose steeply in Thursday's trading. Advanced Energy United, whose members provide solar and wind power, said the FERC order should help clarify how big power users can set up their own power sources.\n\nThe Edison Electric Institute, which represents for-profit utilities, said only that it would “continue to work” to support rapid data center connection, protect ratepayers from cost-shifts and strengthen the grid for everyone.\n\nJeff Dennis, executive director of the Electricity Customer Alliance, said the order showed that FERC is trying to address looming issues around fast-growing power demand and underscored the urgency to reform grid policy.\n\nThursday's order grew out of a dispute between power plant owners and electric utilities over a proposed colocation deal between Amazon’s cloud-computing subsidiary and the owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.\n\nFor tech giants, such arrangements represent a quick fix to quickly get power while avoiding a potentially longer and more expensive process of hooking into a fraying electric grid that serves everyone else.\n\nBut utilities protested that it allows big power users to avoid paying them to maintain the grid. Some consumer advocates maintained that diverting energy from existing power plants to data centers could drive up energy prices without an answer for how rising power demand will be met for regular ratepayers.\n\nFERC's Thursday order sets up a couple new regulatory tracks.\n\nIt requires the operator of the mid-Atlantic grid, PJM Interconnection, to develop rates and conditions for different colocation scenarios involving new power plants or sources.\n\nThat could mean allowing a big power user to pay for only the transmission services they use, considerably less than they might otherwise pay to connect to the grid through a utility.\n\nThe order also could require a big power user that colocates with an existing power plant to pay the cost to replace the energy that it diverts away from the broader electric grid.\n\nFollow Marc Levy on X at https://x.com/timelywriter.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge on Wednesday blocked Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 's attempt to shut down an aging oil pipeline running beneath a channel linking two of the Great Lakes, finding that only the federal government can regulate interstate pipeline safety.\n\nWhitmer, a Democrat, ordered regulators in 2020 to revoke an easement that allows Enbridge Inc. to operate a 4.5-mile (6.4) kilometer pipeline segment under the Straits of Mackinac, which link Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Whitmer made the move out of concern that the 72-year-old pipeline could rupture and cause a catastrophic spill.\n\nEnbridge filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block the revocation and the pipeline continues to operate. President Donald Trump's administration argued in filings this year that Whitmer's order interferes with U.S. foreign energy policy and that only the federal government, not the states, can regulate pipeline safety. The pipeline segment, known as Line 5, moves crude oil between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario.\n\nU.S. District Judge Robert Jonker wrote in an opinion that revoking the easement would effectively shut down Line 5. He found that Congress expressly prohibited states from regulating interstate pipeline safety in the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992. He also noted that the United States and Canada agree that Michigan's attempt to shut down the pipeline interferes with their federal foreign policy positions and trade relations.\n\n“An oil spill in Michigan's Great Lakes would undoubtedly be an environmental catastrophe. And Michigan would undoubtedly be the recipient of almost all the environmental damage that would result,” Jonker wrote. “But for better or worse, the national government has unequivocally decided to displace state power in this area and assume exclusive responsibility for interstate pipeline safety.”\n\nA message seeking comment was left for a spokesperson for Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, whose office represented Whitmer's administration in the lawsuit. A Whitmer spokesperson referred questions to Nessel.\n\nEnbridge issued a statement saying the line is safe and that Jonker's ruling protects both the United States and Canada from “significant energy disruptions.”\n\nMultiple other legal challenges are swirling around Line 5 in Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nNessel filed her own action in 2019 seeking to void the easement in the straits. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently weighing whether that case belongs in state or federal court. And a number of environmental groups and tribes have sued challenging state permits authorizing Enbridge's plan to build a protective tunnel around the straits segment. That case is pending before the Michigan state Supreme Court.\n\nIn Wisconsin, a federal judge ruled in 2023 that Enbridge must remove a section of Line 5 that runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa's reservation. The company has proposed a 41-mile (66-kilometer) route around the reservation, but the tribe and environmentalists say construction could harm the environment and the new route would still leave the region vulnerable to a spill.\n\nThe Bad River has sued in state court seeking to void state permits for the project; that case is still pending. The tribe along with a number of environmental groups also is challenging the permits through the state's contested case process, a proceeding similar to a lawsuit that will culminate with an administrative law judge's ruling.\n\nThe tribe filed a federal lawsuit on Tuesday in Washington, D.C., challenging U.S. Army Corps of Engineer permits authorizing the reroute.",

    "title": "Netflix's bid to buy Warner Bros. hinges on a key question: Who does it actually compete with?",
    "description": "Netflix and Warner Bros. have a deal, but regulators must approve the move. The question of how to define Netflix's market is a major consideration.",
    "fullText": "Would buying Warner Bros. give Netflix too much power?\n\nThe streaming giant is telling regulators it won't, and antitrust experts say the answer ultimately depends on how you define who Netflix competes with.\n\nDoes Netflix compete with only paid streaming services, a market where it dominates? What about the TV dinosaurs it disrupted, or the social video services nipping at its heels? Could sleep even be a competitor, as its cofounder Reed Hastings famously suggested?\n\nRival suitor Paramount Skydance has slammed the Netflix-Warner Bros. mega-deal as anticompetitive, arguing that it would harm consumers and Hollywood talent. Netflix is by far the largest paid subscription video streamer, and it would become even stronger with the addition of WBD's studio assets, including HBO and the Warner Bros. library (stocked with fare like Harry Potter and DC Comics).\n\nNetflix, for its part, is advocating for a definition that considers total US TV viewing time. The streamer, which has expressed confidence in its regulatory case, pointed to this in a letter to its employees on Monday.\n\n\"Even after combining with Warner Bros., our view share would only move from 8% to 9% in the US — still well behind YouTube (13%) and a potential Paramount/WBD combination (14%),\" Netflix's co-CEOs wrote on Monday, citing Nielsen data. A Netflix spokesperson referred to those remarks when asked for comment.\n\nConvincing antitrust regulators of that could be an uphill battle.\n\n\"Antitrust regulators are likely to define the relevant market narrowly,\" said Anthony Palomba, a business professor at the University of Virginia. \"The FTC and DOJ have consistently treated streaming as a discrete competitive arena, separate from linear television, theatrical distribution, or social video platforms.\"\n\nThe president has said the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal \"could be a problem.\"\n\n\"They have a very big market share, and when they have Warner Brothers, you know, that share goes up a lot,\" he said of Netflix.\n\nReuben Miller, the head of antitrust at financial data service Dealreporter, said Netflix's bid would \"be challenged and litigated unless Netflix can convince Trump to come down on their side.\"\n\nHere's how regulators could determine Netflix's competitive market and, by extension, the future of the media business.\n\nA Netflix-Warner Bros. combination would be a colossus. Netflix and HBO Max have accounted for 39% of US paid subscription streaming revenue in 2025, per S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nAny firm with 30% to 40% market share has historically drawn scrutiny from the US government. If regulators see paid streamers as a distinct market, Netflix's Warner Bros. deal could be in trouble.\n\nConsumers may not view social media apps — even when they are watched on a TV screen — as close substitutes for Netflix, Disney+, or Hulu, Palomba said. If so, a Netflix-HBO Max combination could limit choice or lead to price hikes.\n\nThere are few recent parallels to Netflix's Warner Bros. acquisition, Dealreporter's Miller said. One could be Charter Communications, which was allowed to expand its cable operation in 2016, though streamers were in their early days then. Miller said it felt like the government was protecting the nascent streaming industry. However, consumer behavior has changed so dramatically since then that he's unsure if those market definitions would be applicable.\n\n\"The incentive is to start with the assumption that a merger is illegal,\" Miller added. \"They're going to start with as narrow a definition as possible, so they'll probably start with paid streaming. And then the onus is on Netflix to try and get them to expand that market definition.\"\n\nAlthough Netflix is easily the most viewed paid streamer in the US, it's not the top streamer on TV screens.\n\nThat would be free YouTube, whose viewership share has soared relative to Netflix in recent years. At the end of 2022, Netflix and YouTube each commanded 7.5% of viewership on US TVs. But as of October, YouTube had a 12.9% share while Netflix took second place at 8%, according to Nielsen.\n\nAlong with its paid peers, Netflix is also battling free streamers like The Roku Channel and Fox's Tubi that are popular among Gen Z.\n\nWhen adding free streamers into the marketplace, Netflix and HBO Max together accounted for just over a fifth of US streaming minutes in October, MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote on Monday. While 20% share is powerhouse status, it might not be a dealbreaker from an antitrust perspective.\n\nNetflix has argued that it's competing against all of traditional TV, not just streamers.\n\nIts viewership share ranks sixth among TV media distributors, versus its second-place spot in streaming. When measured against cable and broadcast TV, Netflix's 8% share in October was slightly behind the 8.2% share for Paramount, which includes its cable channels and CBS.\n\nAnd since Netflix isn't trying to buy WBD's cable networks like CNN, it could argue that it's only adding a fraction of the media conglomerate's viewership time.\n\nNetflix would undoubtedly love a broad definition of its competitive market that includes TikTok, Instagram, and even video podcasts and video games, which are also spaces where the streamer competes.\n\nSome media insiders see an ultra-broad competitive landscape as a bridge too far.\n\n\"My clients are not pitching shows to YouTube,\" a TV agent said.\n\nCorey Martin of LA-based law firm Granderson Des Rochers said that \"to compare Netflix to YouTube, or even TikTok, is like comparing apples and oranges.\" He said the same applied to video games.\n\nConsumers tend to think of paid streamers like Netflix or Disney+ when they want to watch movies, TV, or sports, Martin said, but \"they don't necessarily think about YouTube or TikTok.\"\n\n\"Directly, it's hard to say that a video game is competing with a movie, or a video game is competing with the TV, even though they do consume our attention,\" said Rahul Telang, a business professor at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nHowever, some see truth in the idea of an all-consuming battle for attention.\n\nBernstein analyst Laurent Yoon said Netflix may be a leader in long-form video, but others have better sports offerings. Yoon also wrote in a mid-December note that attention has shifted to short-form video on Instagram and TikTok, and even new micro dramas.\n\n\"Critics may claim these are apples and oranges, but we heard the same argument about linear vs. streaming only a decade ago,\" Yoon wrote.",

    "fullText": "PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Regulators voted Thursday to extend a shutdown preventing New England fishermen from catching shrimp, a historic industry that has recently fallen victim to warming oceans.\n\nNew England fishermen, especially those from Maine, used to catch millions of pounds of small pink shrimp in the winter, but the business has been under a fishing moratorium since 2014. Rising temperatures have created an inhospitable environment for the shrimp, and their population is too low to fish sustainably, scientists have said.\n\nAn arm of the regulatory Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission voted Thursday to shut down the fishery for at least another three years. Abundance of the shrimp remained “poor” this year despite slightly improved environmental conditions, the Atlantic States said in documents.\n\nThe decision came after shrimp harvesters were allowed to catch a small number of shrimp as part of an industry-funded sampling and data collection program. The fishermen, who battled some rough weather, caught only 70 shrimp totaling less than 3 pounds.\n\nHowever, \"even with the bad weather, exceptionally low catch levels observed throughout the program reinforce concerns about the viability of the northern shrimp stock in the Gulf of Maine,” the documents state.\n\nNew England shrimp were a winter delicacy when the fishery was active, and fishermen sometimes caught more than 10 million pounds (4,536 kilograms) of them in a year. The small pink shrimp were a small part of the country's large wild caught shrimp industry, which catches some of the most valuable seafood in the world.\n\nMaine's catch of shrimp cratered in 2013, when fishermen caught less than 600,000 pounds (272,155 kilograms) of the crustaceans after hauling more than eight times that the previous year. Fishing groups have sometimes lobbied for the shrimping industry to be reopened on a smaller scale basis, but most former Maine shrimpers have moved on to other species.",

    "fullText": "The Avs had an opportunity to be the first team to 50 points tonight, but ultimately, they drop their second loss of the road trip in the shootout to the Nashville Predators 4-3, finishing their east coast trip 2-1-1.\n\nBrock Nelson starts out the scoring with a beautiful deke and a shot that cracks Jusse Saros early. Unfortunately, Scott Wedgewood, in his first game back has a few not-so-good bounces that lead to goals. Jonathan Marchessault capitalizes on a poorly-tracked puck, and Reid Schaefer catches a stagnant Wedgewood to find the league.\n\nArtturi Lehkonen keeps the Avs from heading into the first intermission down and ties it up to make it 2-2 heading into the second period.\n\nA second period that ends scoreless, a ‘no goals’ commercial come to life. The Avs drew a few power plays, but nothing comes of them, and they head into the third on a split power play.\n\nThe third period goes scoreless until just above the seven-minute mark. Wedgewood looks much better in this period, making the first initial saves, but the Preds get it back out high and Brady Skjei finds a lane through traffic (thanks to an unfortunate screen from Sam Malinski) to put Nashville back in the lead.\n\nFear not, with eight seconds left, Cale Makar finds his first goal on the power play in a while, and they grab a point out of a game that they maybe didn’t deserve to.\n\nOvertime is scoreless, but Ryan O’Reilly scores first in the shootout, and he’ll be the lone shootout scorer to push Nashville to win 4-3.\n\nI think he picked up his performance as the game went on, and there’s certainly a conversation to be had about defensive coverage…\n\nBut as far as routine saves go, seems like the two Nashville scored in the first were fairly textbook.\n\nIf at first you don't score, shoot again! pic.twitter.com/hjh5tISYc4\n\n— Nashville Predators (@PredsNHL) December 10, 2025\n\nAnd I get it, right. This is Wedgewood’s first game back since his injury (back tightness per Coach Jared Bednar). Totally fine, especially considering he earned this game back a bit with his performance in the third period. But if you track the puck on the first goal better and lateral movement isn’t nonexistent on the second goal, this game is infinitely easier for the Avs.\n\nDoesn’t help that concussion spotters pull him after Filip Forsberg’s shootout attempt… So, the Avs may have another Wedgewood injury to worry about.\n\nI mean, Cale Makar finally getting his first power play goal since April 3rd, 2025 is an accomplishment, sure. That’s also a goal at 6-on-4, so I’m not counting that one (as pretty as it might be).\n\n8 WITH 8 SECONDS TO GO🥬 pic.twitter.com/iiKIgWeFQ2\n\n— Colorado Avalanche (@Avalanche) December 10, 2025\n\nThis game has an entirely different identity if the Avs can convert on one of the three 5-on-4 opportunities they had in the second period.\n\nI’m not even sure what has to change, except for maybe putting more than just seven shots on goal in six minutes of having a man-advantage.\n\nUltimately, it’s the power play that saves them, but with the third-period lull, you have to get more out of your units in a game like this.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Emil Heineman scored in the fourth round of the shootout after New York allowed a tying goal in the closing seconds of regulation, and the Islanders beat the Vegas Golden Knights 5-4 on Tuesday night.\n\nIlya Sorokin made 33 saves in regulation and overtime before stopping all four Vegas attempts in the shootout.\n\nBo Horvat scored twice, while Marc Gatcomb and Simon Holmstrom also scored for the Islanders, who moved to 5-0 against Pacific Division opponents.\n\nPavel Dorofeyev tied the game for Vegas with 14 seconds remaining in regulation. Just before the end of the third period, New York's Kyle MacLean was called for a high stick, but the Islanders weathered the penalty.\n\nHeineman scored the winner in the shootout by beating Carter Hart with a shot just under his glove. The Islanders trailed 2-0 in the first period before scoring three straight goals.\n\nIvan Barbashev, Mitch Marner and Noah Hanifin added goals for the Golden Knights as their four-game win streak was halted.\n\nHart lost for the first time in three starts since returning to the NHL. The 27-year-old goalie was one of five 2018 Canada world junior hockey players acquitted of sexual assault in July.\n\nWhile Dorofeyev tied the game with 14 seconds left, Beckett Sennecke scored the equalizer for Anaheim with a second remaining at Pittsburgh as the Ducks went on to win 4-3 in a shootout. It marked the 15th day in league history to feature a pair of game-tying goals within the final 15 seconds of regulation, and fourth in the past decade, according to the NHL.\n\nThe Islanders finished 2-0 against the Golden Knights this season. They won 4-3 at Vegas on Nov. 13 courtesy of Jean-Gabriel Pageau's short-handed goal in overtime.\n\nGolden Knights: At Philadelphia on Thursday night.\n\nIslanders: Host Anaheim on Thursday night.\n\nAP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",
