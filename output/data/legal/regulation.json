    "fullText": "Dec 9 (Reuters) - Beijing is set to limit access to Nvidia's advanced H200 chips despite U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to allow the ​export of the technology to China, the Financial Times reported on ‌Tuesday, citing two people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nRegulators in Beijing have been discussing ways to ‌permit limited access to the H200, Nvidia's second-best generation of artificial intelligence chips, according to the report.\n\nSuch a move would add a hurdle to Nvidia and other top U.S. chipmakers' ability to address the China market, after Trump's Monday announcement appeared ⁠to settle a debate over ‌whether these companies should keep their global lead by selling AI chips to China or withhold shipments.\n\nNvidia shares, which had risen ‍as much as 2% in premarket trading, pared gains after the report and were last up about 0.6%. The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for ​comment on the report.\n\nBeijing has been pushing back against domestic firms' use of ‌U.S. technology, especially Nvidia chips, as it retaliates against American restrictions.\n\nEarlier U.S. restrictions banned the sale of advanced AI processors to China, weighing on Nvidia's ability to grow in one of the world's largest markets for AI chips and development.\n\nThe export of the H200 chips will be permitted with a 25% fee levied ⁠on such sales, Trump said in a ​post on Truth Social on Monday.\n\nIpek Ozkardeskaya, senior ​analyst at Swissquote Bank, said the approval alone may have limited impact on Nvidia's business in China unless it is allowed to ‍export other chip ⁠lines such as Blackwell or Rubin.\n\nShares of AMD and Intel also pared gains and were last up about 0.3% in premarket trading. So far ⁠this year, Nvidia has gained nearly 40% compared with the S&P 500 benchmark index's 16.4% rise ‌in the same period.",

    "fullText": "The Avs had an opportunity to be the first team to 50 points tonight, but ultimately, they drop their second loss of the road trip in the shootout to the Nashville Predators 4-3, finishing their east coast trip 2-1-1.\n\nBrock Nelson starts out the scoring with a beautiful deke and a shot that cracks Jusse Saros early. Unfortunately, Scott Wedgewood, in his first game back has a few not-so-good bounces that lead to goals. Jonathan Marchessault capitalizes on a poorly-tracked puck, and Reid Schaefer catches a stagnant Wedgewood to find the league.\n\nArtturi Lehkonen keeps the Avs from heading into the first intermission down and ties it up to make it 2-2 heading into the second period.\n\nA second period that ends scoreless, a ‘no goals’ commercial come to life. The Avs drew a few power plays, but nothing comes of them, and they head into the third on a split power play.\n\nThe third period goes scoreless until just above the seven-minute mark. Wedgewood looks much better in this period, making the first initial saves, but the Preds get it back out high and Brady Skjei finds a lane through traffic (thanks to an unfortunate screen from Sam Malinski) to put Nashville back in the lead.\n\nFear not, with eight seconds left, Cale Makar finds his first goal on the power play in a while, and they grab a point out of a game that they maybe didn’t deserve to.\n\nOvertime is scoreless, but Ryan O’Reilly scores first in the shootout, and he’ll be the lone shootout scorer to push Nashville to win 4-3.\n\nI think he picked up his performance as the game went on, and there’s certainly a conversation to be had about defensive coverage…\n\nBut as far as routine saves go, seems like the two Nashville scored in the first were fairly textbook.\n\nIf at first you don't score, shoot again! pic.twitter.com/hjh5tISYc4\n\n— Nashville Predators (@PredsNHL) December 10, 2025\n\nAnd I get it, right. This is Wedgewood’s first game back since his injury (back tightness per Coach Jared Bednar). Totally fine, especially considering he earned this game back a bit with his performance in the third period. But if you track the puck on the first goal better and lateral movement isn’t nonexistent on the second goal, this game is infinitely easier for the Avs.\n\nDoesn’t help that concussion spotters pull him after Filip Forsberg’s shootout attempt… So, the Avs may have another Wedgewood injury to worry about.\n\nI mean, Cale Makar finally getting his first power play goal since April 3rd, 2025 is an accomplishment, sure. That’s also a goal at 6-on-4, so I’m not counting that one (as pretty as it might be).\n\n8 WITH 8 SECONDS TO GO🥬 pic.twitter.com/iiKIgWeFQ2\n\n— Colorado Avalanche (@Avalanche) December 10, 2025\n\nThis game has an entirely different identity if the Avs can convert on one of the three 5-on-4 opportunities they had in the second period.\n\nI’m not even sure what has to change, except for maybe putting more than just seven shots on goal in six minutes of having a man-advantage.\n\nUltimately, it’s the power play that saves them, but with the third-period lull, you have to get more out of your units in a game like this.",

Just before the end of the third period, New York's Kyle MacLean was called for a high stick, but the Islanders weathered the penalty.\n\nHeineman scored the winner in the shootout by beating Carter Hart with a shot just under his glove. The Islanders trailed 2-0 in the first period before scoring three straight goals.\n\nIvan Barbashev, Mitch Marner and Noah Hanifin added goals for the Golden Knights as their four-game win streak was halted.\n\nHart lost for the first time in three starts since returning to the NHL. The 27-year-old goalie was one of five 2018 Canada world junior hockey players acquitted of sexual assault in July.\n\nWhile Dorofeyev tied the game with 14 seconds left, Beckett Sennecke scored the equalizer for Anaheim with a second remaining at Pittsburgh as the Ducks went on to win 4-3 in a shootout. It marked the 15th day in league history to feature a pair of game-tying goals within the final 15 seconds of regulation, and fourth in the past decade, according to the NHL.\n\nThe Islanders finished 2-0 against the Golden Knights this season. They won 4-3 at Vegas on Nov. 13 courtesy of Jean-Gabriel Pageau's short-handed goal in overtime.\n\nGolden Knights: At Philadelphia on Thursday night.\n\nIslanders: Host Anaheim on Thursday night.\n\nAP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",
