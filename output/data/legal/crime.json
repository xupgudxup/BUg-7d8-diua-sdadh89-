    "fullText": "A California man was arrested on suspicion of murder Friday after a brazen daytime attack in affluent Beverly Hills, where authorities allege he dragged another man with his car, ultimately killing the victim.\n\nPolice said the incident happened at 12:42 p.m. with multiple 911 callers reporting an assault with a deadly weapon near Wilshire and San Vicente boulevards.\n\nAuthorities say a verbal dispute between Christopher Cornelius, 54, of San Bernardino, and the unidentified victim escalated into a violent attack. Witnesses reported that Cornelius beat the man with a metal object, like a pipe or hammer.\n\nCornelius then allegedly drove a white sedan onto the wrong side of the road, struck the victim with his car as he was trying to get up off the ground, and dragged him roughly 100 to 200 feet along San Vicente Boulevard. A graphic video of the horrifying attack was posted to social media.\n\nOfficers found the victim critically injured, and he later died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.\n\nPolice established a containment area and quickly arrested Cornelius, who was found hiding in a nearby building.\n\nCornelius was arrested on a murder charge and is being held on $2 million bail. Police said he has an extensive criminal history, and have not released any additional details about the victim or if he had a connection to Cornelius.\n\nThe Independent contacted the Beverly Hills Police Department \n\nHomicides are rare in the wealthy enclave of Beverly Hills, with the city’s last reported criminal homicide in 2022, according to crime reports on the department’s website. Violent crimes, such as robberies and serious assaults, are also far less common than in surrounding areas of Los Angeles.\n\nAnyone with information about the assault is asked to contact the BHPD at 310-550-4951 or text “TIP BHPDALERT” followed by the tip information to 888777.",

    "description": "More than a year before an American military operation deposed Nicolás Maduro, a senior aide to President Donald Trump argued that the Venezuelan leader had been dispatching gang members into the United States.  \"If you’re a dictator of a poor country with a high crime rate, wouldn’t you send your criminals to our open border?” Stephen Miller told reporters in the closing stretch of Trump's 2024 comeback campaign.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — More than a year before an American military operation deposed Nicolás Maduro, a senior aide to President Donald Trump argued that the Venezuelan leader had been dispatching gang members into the United States.\n\n\"If you’re a dictator of a poor country with a high crime rate, wouldn’t you send your criminals to our open border?” Stephen Miller told reporters in the closing stretch of Trump's 2024 comeback campaign.\n\nMiller now serves as the White House chief of staff for policy, where he plays a prominent role in promoting Trump's policy agenda. His bombastic style and zero-sum worldview have made him a lightning rod within the administration. Critics argue that Miller’s rhetoric about foreign nations and immigrants echoes racist and imperialist ideas that have undergirded military actions by the U.S. and other nations for centuries.\n\nA joint statement from the governments of Spain and five Latin American countries following the Venezuela operation called for countries in the region to engage in “mutual respect, the peaceful settlement of disputes, and nonintervention,” while Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called the administration's Venezuela policy “old-fashioned imperialism.”\n\n“Advocating for policies that put American citizens first isn’t racist. Anyone who says so is either intentionally lying or just plain stupid,” said White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson.\n\nHere's a look at how Miller laid the rhetorical groundwork for this month's attack on Venezuela and what his comments say about the administration's broader worldview.\n\nMiller argues that Western nations’ aid to developing world was ‘reverse colonization’\n\nShortly after the U.S. operation that captured Maduro, Miller wrote on social media: “Not long after World War II the West dissolved its empires and colonies and began sending colossal sums of taxpayer-funded aid to these former territories (despite have already made them far wealthier and more successful). The West opened its borders, a kind of reverse colonization, providing welfare and thus remittances, while extending to these newcomers and their families not only the full franchise but preferential legal and financial treatment over the native citizenry. The neoliberal experiment, at its core, has been a long self-punishment of the places and peoples that built the modern world.\"\n\nMiller argues that Venezuelan oil was stolen from US oil industry\n\nTwo weeks before Maduro's arrest, Miller in December echoed arguments by Trump that the Venezuelan oil industry was stolen from American oil companies:\n\n“American sweat, ingenuity and toil created the oil industry in Venezuela. Its tyrannical expropriation was the largest recorded theft of American wealth and property. These pillaged assets were then used to fund terrorism and flood our streets with killers, mercenaries and drugs,” Miller wrote on social media.\n\nMiller says Venezuelan government is in service to US\n\nMiller in January claimed to reporters that U.S. military power had ensured compliance from the Caracas government.\n\n“We have an oil embargo in Venezuela for them to do any kind of commerce. They need our permission. We have our massive fleet or armada still present there. This is an active and ongoing U.S. government military operation, and so, of course, we set the terms and conditions,\" Miller said.\n\nHe added: “Our conversations are that we are very much getting full, complete and total cooperation from the government of Venezuela, and as a result of that cooperation, the people of Venezuela are going to become richer than they ever have before. And of course, the United States is going to benefit from this massively in terms of economic, security and military cooperation, counter-narcotics, counterterrorism and every other dimension of our security.\"\n\nMiller calls for a world order based on strength, says US military occupation of Greenland would not be opposed\n\nDuring a wide-ranging January interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Miller repeatedly argued for the primacy of American power and criticized the international order the U.S. once led.\n\n“You can talk all you want about international niceties and everything else. But we live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world,\" said Miller.\n\nMiller also dismissed concerns that Trump's vows to take Greenland from Denmark, a fellow member of the NATO military alliance, may trigger a military conflict with Europe.\n\n“Nobody’s going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland,\" said Miller.\n\nMiller argues that Western nations engaged in ‘groveling’ to former colonies\n\nIn the same interview, Miller said it would be “absurd and preposterous” and “not even a serious question” to propose the administration support Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado's bid to lead the country because the military would not back her.\n\nTapper then asked whether the South American country should hold elections.\n\nMiller replied: “The United States is using its military to secure our interests unapologetically in our hemisphere. We’re a superpower, and under President Trump, we are going to conduct ourselves as a superpower. It is absurd that we would allow a nation in our own backyard to become the supplier of resources to our adversaries, but not to us, to hoard weapons from our adversaries, to be able to be positioned as an asset against the United States, rather than on behalf of the United States.”\n\nThe anchor pressed Miller on whether sovereign countries had the right to conduct their own affairs.\n\nMiller explained the administration’s stance: “The Monroe Doctrine and the Trump Doctrine is all about securing the national interest of America. For years, we sent our soldiers to die in deserts in the Middle East to try to build them parliaments, to try to build them democracies, to try to give them more oil, try to give them more resources. The future of the free world, Jake, depends on America being able to assert ourselves and our interests without apology.\" He called for an end to \"This whole period that happened after World War II, where the West began apologizing and groveling and engaging in these massive reparations schemes.”\n\nHe also defended the administration's operation and echoed his past claims that Maduro had sent criminals into the U.S.: “We’re not going to let tinpot communist dictators send rapists into our country, send drugs into our country, send weapons into our country.\"\n\nMiller criticizes anti-ICE protests following immigration crackdown in Minneapolis\n\nMiller has returned to promoting the administration's stance on domestic issues like immigration and partisan politics.\n\nOn Tuesday, following nationwide protests after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman in Minnesota, Miller wrote on social media: “Americans voting overwhelmingly for mass deportation. Congress passed laws requiring it and then passed new legislation to fully fund it. The response of the Democrat Party and its activists has been to support and orchestrate violent resistance against federal law enforcement.”\n\nHe later added in a separate post, “In case it isn’t clear by now, if Democrats won they would have made every city into Mogadishu or Kabul or Port-au-Prince.\"",

Not long after the tool was released, however, users began populating the mission directory with recreations of Charlie Kirk's assassination, with one titled \"We are Charlie Kirk\" being perhaps the most prominent of them.\nNow, according to a January 13 Variety report, Rockstar Games has removed this and added Kirk's name to its repository of banned words. Sources told Variety that the \"profanity filter\" the company refers to internally will be renamed to underscore that the tool isn't used only to flag obscenities but also various harmful content, too.",

    "description": "Simon Foster says he will give report into force’s handling of Maccabi Tel Aviv fan ban ‘careful consideration’ in deciding Craig Guildford’s fate\nHere are extracts from three interesting comment articles about the digital ID U-turn.\nAilbhe Rea in the New Statesman in the New Statesmans says there were high hopes for the policy when it was first announced.\nI remember a leisurely lunch over the summer when a supporter of digital IDs told me how they thought Keir Starmer would reset his premiership. Alongside a reorganisation of his team in Number 10, and maybe a junior ministerial reshuffle, they predicted he would announce in his speech at party conference that his government would be embracing digital IDs. “It will allow him to show he’s willing to do whatever it takes to tackle illegal immigration,” was their rationale.",
    "fullText": "Simon Foster, the Labour West Midlands police and crime commissioner (PCC), has indicated that he will not sack Craig Guildford, the chief constable, on the basis of the report out today.\n\nIn a statement, Foster says that he understands, and shares, the concerns expressed by many people about the force’s handling of the Maccabi Tel Aviv fan ban. But he also signals that it would be wrong to rush to judgment.\n\nHe says he did not get the Andy Cooke report in advance, and that he wants to give it “careful and detailed consideration”.\n\nHe also points out that Cooke is due to publish a further, final report on West Midlands police, and that in his letter (or preliminary report) published today he says his views may “develop or change” as more information comes in.\n\nHe says the Commons home affairs committee has not published its report yet.\n\nIt is my statutory duty to hold the chief constable to account for the totality of policing in the West Midlands.\n\nIn order to give all these issues full and proper consideration, I will be taking this matter to a meeting of my accountability and governance board, held in public, on Tuesday 27 January 2026 and asking questions of the chief constable.\n\nIn consideration of these matters, it is vital that all involved act in accordance with due process and the law at all times.\n\nThe reference to “totality of policing” may be significance. As Vikram Dodd has reported, in some respects Guildford, who became chief constable in 2022, has a good record. The force is now solving 15% of crime, up from 3% when he took over. “Violent crime is down, and times to answer emergency calls, which were among the worst in the country, are now among the best,” Dodd says.",

    "description": "The criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell is likely to further complicate Donald Trump's timeline for naming his replacement.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's search to replace Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has taken a major turn in the new year.\n\nOn Sunday, Powell confirmed an explosive report that he is facing a criminal investigation related to his prior testimony to Congress about the $2.5 billion renovation to the Fed's headquarters.\n\nIn a video statement, Powell said that the probe was in retaliation for his decision to ignore Trump's wishes on rate cuts.\n\n\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said.\n\nTrump told NBC News that he had nothing to do with the grand jury subpoenas sent to the Fed, adding that Powell is \"certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings.\"\n\nNews of the probe has complicated Trump's path to replacing Powell, whose term ends in May.\n\nHere's where Trump's search stands and who is on top of his list.\n\nKevin Hassett, one of Trump's top economic advisors, has long been considered a likely pick to replace Powell.\n\nAs of January, Hassett is tied with Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor, at 40% for the odds of being Trump's pick at both Kalshi and Polymarket.\n\nAsked about the criminal probe into Powell, Hassett said it made sense to investigate why the Fed's renovations overran their initial cost estimates. (The Fed has said costs went up due to changes in design, the increase in cost of materials, and unforeseen complications such as a larger amount of asbestos than anticipated.)\n\n\"I think that it's really important to understand where the taxpayer money goes, and understand why it goes this way or that,\" Hassett told reporters outside the White House on January 12.\n\nBefore joining Trump's orbit, Hassett advised a succession of Republican presidential nominees on economic policy, including George W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney.\n\nDuring Trump's first term, Hassett served as director of the president's Council of Economic Advisors. He returned to the White House during the COVID-19 pandemic and was severely criticized for publishing a model showing coronavirus deaths hitting zero by May 15, 2020.\n\nIn October 1999, Hassett cowrote with journalist Jason Glassman \"Dow 36,000: The New Strategy for Profiting From the Coming Rise in the Stock Market.\" Some economists have heavily criticized the book, largely because the index took more than 22 years to reach that threshold.\n\nTrump has long praised Warsh, the other Kevin on his shortlist to replace Powell.\n\nIn December, Trump told The Wall Street Journal that Warsh was at the top of his list.\n\n\"I think you have Kevin and Kevin. They're both—I think the two Kevins are great,\" he told the publication. \"I think there are a couple of other people that are great.\"\n\nMonths earlier, Trump told reporters that Hassett, Warsh, and current Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller were \"the top three.\"\n\nIn leading prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket, Warsh's odds surged in mid-December, then shrank, and are now trending higher once again.\n\nBack in his first term, Trump reportedly considered Warsh to lead the Fed before he chose to nominate Powell in 2017.\n\nWarsh spent his early years at Morgan Stanley, working as a specialist in mergers and acquisitions. President George W. Bush nominated him to the Fed in 2006 after Warsh served as an economic advisor in the Bush White House.\n\nDrawing on his Wall Street ties, Warsh played a pivotal role in the central bank's response to the 2008 global financial crisis. When he left the Fed in 2011, the Times called him the Fed's chief liaison to Wall Street.\n\nFrom the sidelines, Warsh has echoed Trump's criticism of Powell, calling for \"regime change\" at the Fed.\n\n\"The specter of the miss they made on inflation, it has stuck with them,\" Warsh told CNBC in July. \"So one of the reasons why the president, I think, is right to be pushing the Fed publicly is we need regime change in the conduct of policy.\"\n\nFed Gov. Christopher Waller, who currently serves alongside Powell on the central bank, has previously said that he thought his interview went well.\n\nIn late November, Waller told Fox News he was pleased about his conversation with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has led Trump's search process.\n\nIn mid-December, CNBC reported that unnamed senior administration officials said Waller had a \"strong interview\" with Trump himself.\n\nDespite optimism in the press, Waller's odds have collapsed in leading prediction markets. As of January, Waller is under 10% at both Kalshi and Polymarket.\n\nWaller, a longtime regional Fed official, was seen as a convention pick when Trump nominated him to the central bank in 2019. Simultaneously, Trump also nominated Judy Shelton, a former campaign advisor and a Fed critic. The fight over Shelton's nomination soon spilled over onto Waller's.\n\nIn December 2020, the Senate confirmed Waller 48-47, the narrowest margin for any Fed governor since 1980, per The New York Times.\n\nIn July, Waller joined Gov. Michelle Bowman (another Trump first-term pick) in opposing the Fed's decision not to cut interest rates, the first dual dissent in more than 30 years.\n\nThere's also a big Wall Street name on Trump's shortlist.\n\nRick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, has spent decades on Wall Street, dating back to his time at Lehman Brothers.\n\nRieder is responsible for managing roughly $2.4 trillion in assets, per BlackRock. He's served as a member of the Fed's Investment Advisory Committee on Financial Markets.\n\nFederal Reserve Gov. Michelle Bowman was once thought to be a potential contender, but hasn't received the same buzz as other hopefuls in recent months.\n\nIn 2018, Trump appointed Bowman to the central bank.\n\nAfter confirmation, she was reappointed in 2020. In June, she was narrowly confirmed as the vice chair of supervision.\n\nBowman started as an intern for Sen. Bob Dole. During the George W. Bush administration, she held posts at FEMA and the Homeland Security Department. She was vice president at Farmers and Drovers Bank in Kansas, her family's bank, before becoming the state's top banking official.\n\nIn September 2024, Bowman became the first Fed governor to vote against an interest rate decision since 2005. In July, she again voted against holding rates steady, though this time Waller joined her dissent.\n\nTrump's shortlist at one point reportedly had almost a dozen names.\n\nCNBC previously reported that the following are no longer under consideration: David Zervos, Managing Director and Chief Market Strategist at Jefferies; Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan; former St. Louis Fed President James \"Jim\" Bullard; Fed Gov. Philip Jefferson; and Marc Sumerlin, a former economic advisor to President George W. Bush.\n\nFormer Fed Gov. Larry Lindsey told CNBC that he withdrew from contention.",

    "title": "The controversy behind Jerome Powell's Senate testimony, from the VIP dining room to the special elevators",
    "description": "Jerome Powell says the criminal investigation centers on a June Senate hearing, where he got into a heated exchange over the Fed's renovation plans.",
    "fullText": "In an extraordinary video Sunday night, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said he had been served with grand jury subpoenas as part of a criminal investigation into his testimony about the Fed's Washington, DC, headquarters.\n\nWhile much has been made over whether the probe is a pretext for President Donald Trump to remove Powell as Fed chairman, far less attention has been paid to what Powell actually said in the June Senate testimony that sparked the Justice Department investigation.\n\nWhile criminal probes and grand jury hearings are tightly guarded secrets, here is what we know so far:\n\nAt the June hearing, Powell got into a heated exchange with Sen. Tim Scott, the Republican chair of the Senate banking committee, who criticized the Federal Reserve for \"lavish renovations\" of its main offices.\n\nPowell's responses to Scott's questions prompted one of Trump's allies in the House of Representatives to send a criminal referral to the Justice Department, accusing Powell of perjury.\n\nIn one of the statements singled out by Rep. Anna Paulina Luna as potentially perjurious, Powell said one of the Federal Reserve's buildings never had a \"serious\" renovation. Luna said the building was renovated between 1999 and 2003.\n\nLuna also accused Powell of making a false statement during an exchange with Scott when Powell denied the Federal Reserve would implement some of the more opulent-sounding features it had previously planned.\n\nAt the Senate hearing, Scott pressed Powell with questions about a planning document that said the central bank's historic Marriner S. Eccles building would install \"rooftop garden terraces\" and \"ornate water features,\" as well as new elevators for board members to take to a \"VIP dining suite.\"\n\nPowell dismissed Scott's comments about the project as \"flatly misleading.\"\n\nThe Eccles building had been using the same elevator since the building was built in the 1930s, he said. Other issues Scott raised were \"no longer in the plans,\" Powell told him.\n\n\"There's no special elevators. There are old elevators that have been there,\" he said. \"There are no new water features. There's no beehives, and there's no roof terrace gardens.\"\n\nPowell testified before the Senate Banking Committee in June, following the Federal Reserve's semiannual report, where he discussed the challenges of using interest rates to combat inflation, which he said could remain high due to Trump's tariff policies.\n\nAside from his criticism of the central bank's slow movement on interest rates, Scott criticized the more than $2 billion plan to renovate the Eccles building and the 1951 Constitution Avenue building. He said the changes to those offices \"feel more like they belong in the Palace of Versailles.\"\n\nPowell told senators that the Eccles building had long been in need of renovation for safety reasons. The renovation began in 2022 and is overseen by members of the Federal Reserve board, who are all confirmed by the Senate. Trump nominated Powell himself in his first term in 2017.\n\n\"When I was the administrative governor, before I became chair, I came to understand how badly the Eccles building really needed a serious renovation,\" he said. \"Never had one. It was not really safe and it was not waterproof.\"\n\nThe following month, Luna said Powell had broken the law by perjuring himself and making false statements to Congress.\n\nShe sent a criminal referral to Attorney General Pam Bondi, asking the Justice Department to open an investigation into the Federal Reserve chairman.\n\nIt isn't clear if Luna's referral formed the basis for the ongoing criminal investigation into Powell. A representative for the US Attorney's Office in Washington, DC, declined to comment.\n\nLuna's letter said Powell's statements at the hearing contradicted a Federal Reserve planning document, which said the central bank's buildings would get new rooftop gardens, outdoor water jets, and a private dining room.\n\nA spokesperson for Luna said her letter relied on the same 2021 document that Scott had asked Powell about in the June hearing.\n\nPowell told the senator the renovation project had already scrapped some luxurious-sounding features and that the plans had \"continued to evolve.\"\n\nThe renovation would be thrifty with building materials, Powell said.\n\n\"There's no new marble,\" he said. \"We took down the old marble, we're putting it back up. We'll have to use new marble where some of the old marble broke.\"\n\nA two-page fact sheet on the Federal Reserve's website about the renovations of the two historic buildings reiterates what Powell said. \"No new VIP dining rooms are being constructed as part of the project,\" \"There is no VIP elevator,\" \"There are no new water features,\" some bullet points read.\n\nLuna also said Powell lied to Congress when he said the Federal Reserve's Eccles building had \"never had\" a \"serious renovation.\"\n\n\"This statement is also false,\" Luna wrote. \"The Federal Reserve Board conducted a comprehensive renovation of the Eccles Building from 1999 to 2003, which included the replacement of the roof, all major systems, and a full refurbishing of interior and courtyard spaces.\"\n\nLuna accused Powell of making another false statement to Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought when he wrote a letter saying changes to the construction plans were intended to \"simplify construction and reduce the likelihood of further delays and cost increases.\"\n\nTrump has denied knowing about the DOJ's probe, but he has not been shy about voicing his dissatisfaction with the Federal Reserve for not lowering interest rates faster.\n\nHe has said he would like to fire Powell, and made the unusual move of announcing plans to select Powell's replacement ahead of the expiration of Powell's 10-year term in 2028. Trump has also attempted to fire Lisa Cook, a Biden appointee on the Federal Reserve board, in a case that will be heard before the Supreme Court next week.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's renovation plans have irked Trump, who complained about the project's cost during a July tour of the construction site with Powell and Scott.\n\nIn his statement Sunday, Powell said the Justice Department subpoena \"should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"\n\n\"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings,\" he said, adding, \"Those are pretexts.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with a comment from a Rep. Luna spokesperson.",

    "title": "Seattle order to stop drug arrests ‘creating havoc’ for people fending off addicts surviving on theft: expert",
    "description": "Seattle's new drug enforcement approach sparks debate as police and advocates warn of rising crime and open-air drug markets returning to streets.",
    "fullText": "Seattle’s new approach to drug enforcement is triggering alarm among police and public safety advocates, who warn the city is quietly sliding back toward the conditions that once fueled crime, open-air drug markets and deadly overdoses.\n\nCity leaders last week pushed back against criticism that they had effectively stopped prosecuting drug users, saying there had been no formal policy change. The clarification came in an email from the Seattle Police Department, which said officers were still expected to enforce drug laws despite an internal communication that sparked backlash.\n\n\"There has been no policy change,\" new Seattle Mayor Katie Wilson previously said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"You’ll know when I announce a policy change, because I’ll announce a policy change.\"\n\nCritics, however, say the reality on the ground tells a different story.\n\nSeattle Leaders Slammed For Police Order To Stop Prosecuting Drug Users\n\nAndrea Suarez, founder of the nonprofit We Heart Seattle, which works with people experiencing homelessness and addiction, said the city's policies have created a \"safe place\" for drug addicts and criminals.\n\n\"It will trap people longer in the cycle of addiction, creating havoc in our communities as they survive off theft, by and large,\" she said.\n\nConservative radio host and Seattle-based commentator Jason Rantz told Fox News Digital city officials are downplaying concerns by insisting nothing has changed, even as enforcement practices shift in practice.\n\nAccording to Rantz, the change did not originate with Wilson but with the Seattle City Attorney’s Office, which he said has signaled prosecutors will decline to pursue most drug cases except those deemed \"egregious.\"\n\n\"That’s de facto decriminalization,\" Rantz said, regardless of how city officials describe it. He warned that when officers believe arrests will not be charged, enforcement inevitably collapses. \"Officers aren’t going to risk injury or their careers for arrests they know won’t stick.\"\n\nRantz said the city risks returning to conditions it has already experienced — widespread public drug use, open-air dealing and surging overdoses. He pointed to past diversion-based approaches that failed to deliver promised results, arguing Seattle is repeating a cycle with well-documented consequences.\n\nMeet The Socialist Mamdani-style Mayor Just Elected To Run West Coast's 5Th Largest City\n\n\"This isn’t speculation,\" Rantz said. \"We’ve already lived this.\"\n\nAs a resident who lives and works in Seattle, Rantz said the effects are already felt daily. He described routinely encountering people actively using fentanyl or meth while walking his dog and said many residents, particularly downtown workers and small business owners, live with constant fear that city leaders dismiss.\n\nThat fear, he said, is not unfounded. Rantz cited a recent attack on an elderly woman who was struck in the face with a board containing a nail, leaving her blind. The suspect has a long criminal history but remained on the streets.\n\nBlue Cities U-turn On Distributing Drug Supplies To Addicts After Progressive Policies Fail To Stem Epidemic\n\n\"These crimes are random,\" Rantz said. \"It can happen to anyone — a tourist, a worker, someone just going to a doctor’s appointment.\"\n\nRantz also warned the shift could worsen Seattle’s ongoing police staffing crisis. City leaders said last year that the department was 260 officers short, KOMO News reported.\n\n\"If cops can’t police, they won’t stay,\" Rantz said, warning retirements and resignations could push the department toward dysfunction.\n\nIncumbent Seattle Mayor Concedes To Mamdani-style 'Socialist' Who Tapped Her Parents For Money While Running\n\nRantz argued the people most harmed by lax enforcement are the same ones city leaders say they are trying to help.\n\n\"The first victims are the homeless and drug-addicted individuals themselves,\" he said. \"Instead of getting help, they’re being emboldened to continue habits that will kill them — while the rest of the city pays the price in crime and disorder.\"\n\nPublic safety advocates working directly on the streets say those concerns are already playing out.\n\nSeattle's Socialist Mayor May Be 'Less Constrained' Than Mamdani, Washington Post Warns\n\nSuarez said drug activity has rapidly spread into residential neighborhoods and public spaces.\n\n\"Today looked more like Gotham City than the Emerald City,\" Suarez wrote in a post on X, citing growing drug scenes in Beacon Hill, Mount Baker, city parks and along sidewalks.\n\nSuarez told Fox News Digital that diverting offenders away from prosecution removes a critical point of accountability.\n\n\"Not prosecuting for possession and public consumption and instead diverting to Community Court or the LEAD program simply removes rock bottom for an addict,\" Suarez said.\n\nShe questioned what actually happens after an officer decides to arrest someone or divert them, arguing the process remains unclear years after diversion programs were introduced.\n\n\"Nobody can explain what the system within the system is once an officer decides to arrest or hand off to LEAD (Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion),\" Suarez said. \"It is 2026, and we still do not have answers on how this proclaimed, award-winning, evidence-based program is better than sweating it out in jail.\"\n\nSuarez warned that diversion without consequences can trap people in addiction and fuel property crime. She also argued Seattle’s permissive approach has turned the city into a magnet for drug activity.\n\n\"Seattle has been and seems to forever be a safe place for drug addicts and criminals to come to easily score and use drugs and avoid accountability,\" Suarez said. \"It is why our homeless numbers never improve.\"\n\n\"We have an inflow crisis in ‘Freeattle,’\" she added.\n\nSeattle Leaders Slammed For Police Order To Stop Prosecuting Drug Users\n\nThe Seattle Police Officers Guild also weighed in, releasing a statement from President Mike Solan sharply criticizing the city’s direction. Solan described the decision to limit arrests for open drug use as \"horrifically dangerous\" and warned it would lead to \"more death and societal decay.\"\n\n\"This is commonly referred to as ‘suicidal empathy,’\" Solan said. He added that officers are reluctant to refer cases to diversion programs they believe are ineffective and said Seattle’s streets have already shown the fallout from similar policies: \"death, decay, blight and crime.\"\n\n\"Now, with this resurrected insane direction, death, destruction and more human suffering will be supercharged,\" Solan warned.\n\nIn response to concerns raised by police, advocates and residents, the Seattle Police Department said officers will continue enforcing drug laws and making arrests when they have probable cause, despite criticism that enforcement is being scaled back.\n\n\"Our mission remains the same and we are aligned with the City Attorney and Mayor’s Office when it comes to keeping Seattle safe from dangerous drugs,\" a Seattle Police Department spokesperson said. \"Our officers will continue to make drug-related arrests if they have probable cause. They will also collaborate with prosecutors.\"\n\nThe department said officers can flag cases where diversion may be ineffective and coordinate with prosecutors on other options, including prosecution.\n\nChief Shon Barnes reiterated that position in a recent message to officers, writing, \"Our mission remains unchanged, and we fully support programs and policies aimed at reducing recidivism and breaking the cycle of repeated criminal justice involvement.\"\n\nThe Seattle City Attorney’s Office said guidance that took effect January 1, 2026, directs most drug possession and public use cases to be reviewed for diversion before charges are filed.\n\nUnder the memo, when an officer submits a report for knowing possession or public use, the case is first referred to the LEAD Liaison Team, which evaluates whether the individual has previously engaged with the program. If the person has refused or failed to meaningfully participate, prosecutors can consider other options.\n\nThe guidance also allows officers or prosecutors to elevate cases involving \"unique, articulable circumstances\" for possible prosecution. In those situations, the Criminal Division Chief may consult with LEAD officials, prosecutors and the referring officer before making a final decision.\n\nCritics argue that while the policy preserves the possibility of prosecution, the default reliance on diversion could still discourage enforcement and leave neighborhoods dealing with increased disorder.\n\nOriginal article",

    "description": "The investigation, which centers on renovations of the Federal Reserve’s headquarters in Washington, signals an escalation in the long-running clash between President Trump and the chair.",
    "fullText": "The U.S. attorney’s office in the District of Columbia has opened a criminal investigation into Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, over the central bank’s renovation of its Washington headquarters and whether Mr. Powell lied to Congress about the scope of the project, according to officials briefed on the situation.\n\nThe inquiry, which includes an analysis of Mr. Powell’s public statements and an examination of spending records, was approved in November by Jeanine Pirro, a longtime ally of President Trump who was appointed to run the office last year, the officials said.\n\nThe investigation escalates Mr. Trump’s long-running feud with Mr. Powell, whom the president has continually attacked for resisting his demands to slash interest rates significantly. The president has threatened to fire the Fed chair — even though he nominated Mr. Powell for the position in 2017 — and raised the prospect of a lawsuit against him related to the $2.5 billion renovation, citing “incompetence.”\n\nMr. Trump told The New York Times in an interview last week that he had decided on who he wants to replace Mr. Powell as Fed chair. He is expected to soon announce his decision. Kevin A. Hassett, Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, is a front-runner for the top job. While Mr. Powell’s term as chair ends in May, his term as a governor runs through January 2028. Mr. Powell has not disclosed whether he plans to stay on at the central bank beyond this year.\n\nIn a rare video message released by the Fed on Sunday, Mr. Powell described the investigation as “unprecedented” and questioned the motivation for the move, even as he affirmed that he carried out his duties as chair “without political fear or favor.”\n\n“This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings,” he said. “It is not about Congress’s oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts.”\n\nHe warned that the investigation signaled a broader battle over the Fed’s independence. “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,” he added. “This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.”\n\nA spokesman for Attorney General Pam Bondi did not comment on the investigation but said Ms. Bondi had “instructed her U.S. attorneys to prioritize investing any abuses of taxpayer dollars.”\n\nThe U.S. attorney’s investigation into Mr. Powell underscores Mr. Trump’s larger clash with the Fed. Other broadsides have included an effort to oust Lisa D. Cook, a governor at the central bank whom Mr. Trump tried to fire over allegations of mortgage fraud. Presidents are able to remove officials at the Fed only for “cause,” which has typically meant malfeasance or a dereliction of duty. The Supreme Court will hear arguments for Ms. Cook’s case on Jan. 21.\n\nCongress granted the Fed the authority to set interest rates free of meddling from presidents, whose political fortunes are often tethered to how the economy is faring. Rather, lawmakers stipulated that the central bank should pursue low, stable inflation and a healthy labor market.\n\nMr. Powell said on Sunday that the Justice Department had served the Fed with grand jury subpoenas. Prosecutors in Ms. Pirro’s office have contacted Mr. Powell’s staff multiple times to request documents about the renovation project, according to an official with knowledge of the investigation who discussed an open inquiry on the condition of anonymity.\n\nStarting an investigation is one thing, presenting sufficient evidence to secure an indictment from a federal grand jury — or making it stick — is another.\n\nIndictments against two of Mr. Trump’s top targets, the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey and Letitia James, the New York attorney general, were thrown out in November by a federal judge. An investigation into Senator Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, has yet to yield enough evidence to present to a grand jury.\n\nThe renovations at the center of the investigation into Mr. Powell broke ground in 2022 and are set to be completed in 2027. They are estimated to be about $700 million over budget. The project involves expanding and modernizing the Marriner S. Eccles Building and another building on Constitution Avenue, which date to the 1930s.\n\nThe Fed has said that neither of those buildings has been “comprehensively renovated” since their construction nearly 100 years ago, suggesting they were in need of a significant overhaul. Part of the project includes removing asbestos and lead contamination as well as making the facilities compliant with laws related to accessibility for people with disabilities.\n\nA 2021 version of the Fed’s proposal described private elevators and dining rooms for top policymakers, water fountains and new marble features, in addition to a rooftop terrace for staff. Pressed at a congressional hearing in June, Mr. Powell denied that many of those features were part of the latest proposal.\n\n“There’s no V.I.P. dining room; there’s no new marble,” he said. “We took down the old marble, we’re putting it back up. We’ll have to use new marble where some of the old marble broke. But there’s no special elevators. There’s just old elevators that have been there.”\n\nMr. Powell added that the project’s plans had “continued to evolve” and that some features that had been initially incorporated were scrapped.\n\nAfter Mr. Powell’s testimony, the Fed published a “Frequently Asked Questions” post on its website that reaffirmed Mr. Powell’s answers to lawmakers. The central bank continued to share additional details, including a virtual tour as well as photographs and annotations to the 2021 proposal that prompted the criticism.\n\nIn explaining the cost overruns, the central bank cited expenses tied to materials, equipment and labor as well as unforeseen circumstances, such as more asbestos than anticipated and soil contamination.",

    "fullText": "ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — A judge’s ruling that a Trump administration prosecutor in upstate New York was serving unlawfully has spilled into another case — with the same judge saying he can’t obtain tax return information in a criminal investigation because he lacks authority.\n\nThe ruling Thursday against prosecutor John Sarcone from U.S. District Judge Lorna G. Schofield came the same day the judge disqualified Sarcone from overseeing investigations into Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James. In that case, Schofield ruled that Sarcone was not lawfully serving as acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of New York and that any “of his past or future acts taken in that capacity are void or voidable.”\n\nSarcone is among the prosecutors around the country found by federal judges to lack authority after the Republican administration used unusual maneuvers to place them or keep them in their posts without U.S. Senate confirmation.\n\nCarl Tobias, a professor of law at the University of Richmond, said Schofield's ruling was consistent with previous decisions.\n\n“It does seem like more and more courts are coming around to this view,” he said.\n\nIn a separate ruling Thursday, Schofield denied Sarcone's application for a court order directing the IRS to disclose tax return information for a limited liability company as part of a criminal investigation. The application remains sealed and it's not clear who filed the tax returns sought in the Oct. 2 request.\n\nApplications for that tax information can only be made by officials holding specific positions, such as U.S. attorneys. The Manhattan judge said Sarcone lacked authority to authorize the application because he was not lawfully serving as acting U.S. attorney — mirroring her reasoning in the case involving James.\n\nAn email seeking comment was sent to the northern district.\n\nCourts in New Jersey, Nevada and California have held that similarly installed acting U.S. attorneys lacked lawful authority.

    "fullText": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A complicated crime scene and uncooperative witnesses hindered Salt Lake City police efforts to investigate a fatal shooting outside a house of worship belonging to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nThe shooting in a church parking lot Wednesday night left two people dead and six injured, including five who remained hospitalized with police protection Thursday. Investigators said the shooting erupted from a dispute between people who knew each other and were attending a funeral.\n\nNo arrests had been made as of early Thursday evening. Authorities say they do not know whether the shooting was gang-related and that they are having trouble getting witnesses to cooperate.\n\nPolice do not believe the shooting was random or motivated by animus against The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, known widely as the Mormon church.\n\n“Our houses of worship are sacred, whatever the affiliation,” Salt Lake City Police Chief Brian Redd said Thursday. “We should all protect those spaces. We should all respect those spaces.”\n\nAll the shooting victims were adults. Vaea Tulikihihifo, 46, and Sione Vatuvei, 38, were identified as the two people killed.\n\nThe red brick church in northwest Salt Lake City mostly serves Tongan congregants and holds regular worship services in their native tongue, according to its website.\n\nLatter-day Saint missionaries first arrived in Tonga in the early 1890s, according to the church’s website. At first, they had little success and the mission closed in 1897. But a decade later, missionaries opened a school in Neiafu, Tonga’s second-largest town, and began preaching across the islands. Dozens of other schools were started by missionaries and seven remain open. The church's membership in Tonga has grown to 68,000 and 175 congregations.\n\n“Since the 19th century, the church has had a really, really prominent place in Tongan society. Depending on who you ask, somewhere between one-third and two-thirds of everybody who lives in Tonga are members of the LDS church,” said Matthew Bowman, a Claremont Graduate University professor specializing in U.S. religious history.\n\nToday, more than a quarter of the Tongan population in the U.S. resides in Utah, where the church is headquartered. The state's Tongan population is about 23,000 and is mostly concentrated in Salt Lake County, according to census data.\n\nOn Wednesday night, residents from a housing complex next to the church flooded outside to help victims and console dozens of people who had been attending a funeral for a man identified by family on social media as Asi Sekona. Several family members could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nBrennan McIntire said he and his wife, Kenna, heard several loud gunshots from their apartment next to the church parking lot while watching TV. He jumped off the couch and ran outside in flip-flops to see what happened.\n\n“As soon as I came over, I see someone on the ground,” he said. “People are attending to him and crying and arguing.”\n\nKenna McIntire came outside soon after and was rattled at the sight of first responders lifting an unconscious woman into an ambulance while people huddled around and sobbed.\n\nThe couple said they hear gunshots in their neighborhood almost daily, but never right outside their door.\n\n“It was really heartbreaking to hear and see,” Kenna McIntire said.\n\nAbout 100 law enforcement vehicles were at the scene in the aftermath, and helicopters flew overhead. Police said they were reviewing license plate readers and surveillance videos from nearby businesses in their search for suspects.\n\nThe church was cooperating with law enforcement and said it was grateful for first responders' quick efforts.\n\n“We extend prayers for all who have been impacted by this tragedy and express deep concern that any sacred space intended for worship should be subjected to violence of any kind,” church spokesperson Sam Penrod said.\n\nLatter-day Saints have been on heightened alert since four people were killed when a former Marine opened fire in one of their churches in Michigan in September and set it ablaze.

    "description": "Barry Pollack has a long track record of sensitive cases involving national security, and of defending corporate executives in criminal trials.",
    "fullText": "When Nicolás Maduro needed someone to represent him in an American courtroom, he turned to a lawyer with experience facing off against the federal government.\n\nThe Venezuelan political leader hired Barry Pollack, a criminal defense attorney who's represented WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange, as well as other high-profile defendants.\n\nThe Justice Department has accused Maduro, who was serving as Venezuela's president when he was captured by US forces, of participating in a narco-terrorism conspiracy, alleging he worked with illegal drug gangs. They also accused him and his wife, Cilia Flores, of conspiring to illegally import cocaine into the United States and of gun-related charges.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, US Marshals escorted the couple into a 26th-floor courtroom in lower Manhattan, where they entered not-guilty pleas and proclaimed their innocence. US military forces apprehended Maduro and Flores in a pre-dawn operation on Saturday in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas and brought them to the United States.\n\nAt the hearing, Pollack told US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein that he would file \"voluminous and complicated\" motions on Maduro's behalf, suggesting he would challenge the charges and the basis for his arrest.\n\n\"Mr. Maduro is the head of a sovereign state,\" Pollack said in court. \"He is entitled to the privileges and immunities that go with that office. In addition, there are issues about the legality of this military abduction.\"\n\nDelcy Rodriguez was sworn in as Venezuela's interim president on Monday afternoon.\n\nPollack, an attorney at the boutique law firm Harris St. Laurent & Wechsler LLP, is best known as one of the many lawyers who represented Assange, the publisher of WikiLeaks.\n\nProsecutors had accused Assange of working with hackers to obtain government secrets from federal agencies and American companies, as well as conspiring with former US Army officer Chelsea Manning to leak documents about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\n\nAssange pleaded guilty to espionage charges in the summer of 2024, capping a six-year legal battle that involved complex negotiations with multiple governments.\n\nPollack's experience with sensitive national security matters could be an asset for his representation of Maduro, which will likely involve classified information. The attorney has also represented Jeffrey Sterling, a former CIA officer who was convicted of espionage charges after leaking information to a journalist.\n\nTo be paid, Pollack will likely need a waiver from the US Treasury Department, which has sanctioned Maduro and the Venezuelan government.\n\nIt's not clear when Pollack began representing Maduro. He formally entered an appearance on the court docket late Monday morning. Maduro was first indicted in 2020, and Hellerstein has overseen court proceedings against other Venezuelan nationals accused of conspiring with him. Pollack didn't respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nA court-appointed lawyer for Maduro, David Wikstrom, told Business Insider he was informed at 8:40 a.m. on Monday that he would be representing the Venezuelan president in court. Shortly before the noon court hearing, he said he still hadn't spoken to Pollack, who ultimately represented Maduro in the proceeding.\n\nFlores is represented by Mark Donnelly, a Texas-based attorney who served as a federal prosecutor for 12 years, and one of his law partners, Andres Sanchez.\n\nPollack, a former public defender and president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, has a long track record of successful defense outcomes in criminal trials.\n\nHe represented former Enron accountant Michael W. Krautz, who a jury acquitted of fraud charges. And he successfully overturned the conviction of Martin Tankleff, a Long Island man who spent 17 years in prison after he was falsely accused of killing his parents as a teenager.\n\nMore recently, Pollack represented the executive of a poultry company accused of conspiring to fix the price of chickens. Jurors declined to find the executive guilty in two separate trials.\n\nIn a 2025 interview with Lawdragon, Pollack decried the Justice Department's \"extraordinary view\" of its jurisdiction for criminal cases, using the Assange case as an example.\n\n\"You've got somebody who's not a United States citizen who is publishing information not in the United States, had not set foot in the United States, with respect to any of the alleged offensive conduct,\" Pollack said. \"The information was leaked to him by somebody in Iraq. Yet the United States obviously felt that it could pursue that as a criminal offense in the United States.\"",

    "fullText": "The British government cracked down on illegal car parts in recent weeks, seizing a massive haul from a single purveyor.\n\nAccording to a press release from the UK government, police seized 3,600 fake car parts valued at over £100,000 from a self-storage facility in South Gloucestershire.\n\nThe parts included spark plugs, oil filters, air filters, fuel filters, windshield wiper blades, and sensors, all designed to help bypass safety testing.\n\nOfficials found improperly labeled parts manufactured to masquerade as properly certified parts, and parts without labels in plain boxes, intended to bilk consumers.\n\nCounterfeit car parts are a booming black market in the UK; according to a 2024 report, the amount imported to the UK in 2021 was worth £2.2 billion.\n\nA second report showed that one in six British drivers had either knowingly or unknowingly purchased counterfeit parts for their car.\n\nHowever, there was more at issue than simply protecting brand rights or licensing fees; counterfeit parts are often made from inferior materials and have not been properly safety-tested, making them more prone to failure or other issues than standard parts.\n\nWhile that may mean they're cheaper in the short term, the repeated need to replace them drives repair costs through the roof.\n\nOn top of that, parts failing while the car is on the road can cause potentially serious incidents, and the inferior materials used in manufacturing could pose health hazards to drivers and passengers.\n\n\"Counterfeit vehicle parts are not just illegal — they are potentially lethal,\" said South Gloucestershire Council Cabinet Member for Trading Standards, Sean Rhodes.\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\n\"Our Trading Standards team, working with national partners and industry experts, has acted decisively to protect motorists and the wider public,\" he continued.\n\n\"We urge everyone to be vigilant when buying vehicle parts, especially online, and to report anything suspicious. Safety must come first, and this seizure sends a clear message that we will not tolerate criminal activity that could put lives at risk.\"\n\nAmid the British government's efforts address counterfeit parts, the Gloucestershire raid was a perfect example of the work it's doing.\n\nOfficials also provided consumers with tips to help avoid being scammed by inferior parts.\n\nChecking for serial numbers, iffy packaging, vague product descriptions, missing safety guidelines, and spelling or grammar mistakes on packaging or instructions are all signals that parts may be fake and should be reported to the Board of Trade.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

She was 36 years old when she was reported missing.\n\nSteele is originally from New York, but previously lived in Virginia before moving to Pennsylvania. State Police said it is possible she could have traveled to Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nSteele is reportedly a survivor of human trafficking and left where she was living in Carlisle to head to Las Vegas for a program that would help give her rehabilitation care for what she went through, according to a report in June 2025 from Newsnation.\n\nThe report says Steele was supposed to fly to Las Vegas from the Keystone State to get help, but her flight was delayed and she was put in a hotel.

    "title": "Mar-a-Lago Was Key to Jeffrey Epstein’s Criminal Enterprise",
    "description": "Jeet...",
    "fullText": "New reporting shows that Trump’s split with his pedophile friend was opportunistic.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Donald Trump delivered the most bizarre yuletide message ever offered by a US president. Complaining that he’s being unfairly linked to the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, Trump posted a long rant on Truth Social that began, “Merry Christmas to all, including the many Sleazebags who loved Jeffrey Epstein.” Trump went on to lament how he is being blamed for his ties with Epstein, protesting that he was “actually the only one who did drop Epstein, and long before it became fashionable to do so.”\n\nTrump’s claim to have dropped Epstein is partly true but obscures a crucial fact: that he and Epstein were close friends from the 1980s until their break at some point in 2003. Epstein had been barred from the spa at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in 2003 and the two men seemed to have a more definitive break in 2004. The exact circumstances of the break remain mysterious, since Trump has offered conflicting accounts, sometimes claiming that he was mad that Epstein “stole” an employee from Mar-a-Lago and sometimes referring to competition the two men had over real estate in 2004.\n\nThe nature of Epstein’s relationship with Donald Trump has been clarified by a damning report published by The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. The report makes clear that Mar-a-Lago was crucial to Epstein’s sexual predation, a fact that was well-known by Trump’s inner circle long before Epstein was charged with any crime. One reasonable inference from the report is that Epstein was protected by a system of plausible deniability at Mar-a-Lago that allowed him to use the resort to harvest victims. Trump initiated a break with Epstein only once a formal complaint by a Mar-a-Lago employee made it impossible to maintain plausible deniability.\n\nJeffrey Epstein wasn’t just a frequent visitor to Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The club was also sending spa employees—usually young women—to Epstein’s nearby mansion for massages, manicures and other spa services, according to former Mar-a-Lago and Epstein employees.\n\nThe house calls went on for years, even as spa employees warned each other about Epstein, who was known among staff for being sexually suggestive and exposing himself during the appointments, according to the former Mar-a-Lago employees.\n\nThe spa occasionally provided house calls for members. Epstein wasn’t a dues-paying member of the club, but Trump told staff to treat him like one, the employees said. Epstein had an account at the spa where his companion, Ghislaine Maxwell, booked appointments on his behalf.\n\nBased on this report, the question becomes: What did Donald Trump know about Jeffrey Epstein’s predations and when did he know it? Trump was married to Marla Maples from 1993 to 1999. Maples, according to the Journal, “in the mid-1990s warned her husband and others there was something ‘off’ about Epstein.”\n\nIn 2000, Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s most important accomplice, recruited Mar-a-Lago employee Virginia Giuffre to work with Epstein. Giuffre was raped by Epstein, who also sexually trafficked her to his friends.\n\nIn 2002, Trump told New York magazine, “I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.” In January of the following year, Trump sent a birthday card to Epstein full of sexual innuendo.\n\nA crisis in the Epstein-Trump relationship started soon after. As the Journal details, the Mar-a-Lago arrangement ended “after an 18-year-old beautician returned to the club from a house call to Epstein and reported to managers that he had pressured her for sex, former employees said.” The Journal reported that former employees said a manager then faxed Trump the allegations and urged him to ban Epstein, which Trump did.\n\nWhile Trump and his supporters will claim that the fact Trump barred Epstein from the Mar-a-Lago spa in 2003 exonerates the president, the facts of the case make Trump’s culpability much more evident.\n\nTrump had every reason to know before 2003 that Epstein was sexually mistreating Mar-a-Lago employees, some of whom were under the age of consent. The 2003 letter from the beautician created a problem for Trump: He no longer had plausible deniability about Epstein’s misconduct. There was now a paper trail, one that could be used against Trump. His break with Epstein was entirely opportunistic. Trump may not be criminally culpable in this situation. It would certainly be difficult to prove he’s guilty of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. But in judging politicians, criminal guilt is not the only standard to use. On any reasonable moral ground, Trump’s behavior was atrocious. Mar-a-Lago was key to Epstein’s criminal enterprise. Trump’s critics should not hesitate to hammer this fact home.",

A total of 31, including five minors, were hospitalized with injuries.\n\nA criminal probe on the charges of carrying out an act of terrorism has been opened, Petrenko said.\n\nKyiv denied attacking civilians. Spokesman of Ukraine’s General Staff, Dmytro Lykhovii, told Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne on Thursday that Ukrainian forces “adhere to the norms of international humanitarian law” and \"carry out strikes exclusively against Russian military targets, facilities of the Russian fuel and energy sector, and other lawful targets.”\n\nLykhovii said that General Staff has published an explicit list of targets that the Ukrainian army struck on the night of New Year’s Eve. The list did not include strikes on occupied parts of the Kherson region.\n\nLykhovii noted that Russia has repeatedly used disinformation and false statements to disrupt the ongoing peace negotiations.\n\nThe Associated Press could not independently verify claims made about the attack.\n\nRussia's accusations against Ukraine come amid a U.S.-led diplomatic push to end the nearly four-year war in Ukraine. Earlier this week, Moscow alleged that Kyiv launched a long-range drone attack against a residence of Russian President Vladimir Putin in northwestern Russia overnight from Sunday to Monday.\n\nKyiv has called the allegations of an attack on Putin’s residence a ruse to derail ongoing peace negotiations, which have ramped up in recent weeks on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nIn his New Year’s address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that a peace deal was “90% ready” but warned that the remaining 10%, believed to include key sticking points such as territory, would “determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe, how people will live.”\n\nTrump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff said Wednesday that he, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner had a “productive call” with the national security advisers of Britain, France, Germany and Ukraine “to discuss advancing the next steps in the European peace process.”\n\nElsewhere in Ukraine, Russia conducted what local authorities called “one of the most massive” drone attacks at Zaporizhzhia overnight.\n\nAt least nine Russian drones struck the city, damaging dozens of residential buildings and other civilian infrastructure, head of the regional administration, Ivan Fedorov, wrote on Telegram on Friday. There were no casualties, the official said.\n\nOverall, Russia fired 116 long-range drones at Ukraine last night, according to Ukraine’s Air Force, which said that 86 drones were intercepted, while 27 more have reached their targets.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry reported Friday that its air defenses intercepted 64 Ukrainian drones overnight over multiple Russian regions.\n\nVyacheslav Gladkov, governor of Russia's Belgorod region on the border with Ukraine, on Friday also accused Ukrainian forces of carrying out a missile strike on the city of Belgorod. Two women were hospitalized with injuries, Gladkov said. The strike shattered windows in multiple residential buildings and damaged an unspecified “commercial” facility and a number of cars, according to the official.",

    "fullText": "Earlier this week, Olympic gold medalist and former two-time Heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua was involved in a tragic car accident that claimed the lives of two passengers — his close friends and longtime trainers, Sina Ghami and Kevin Ayodele.\n\nAccording to Sky News, Joshua was discharged from the hospital on Weds., Dec. 31, 2025, and is now recovering at home. Details regarding the nature of his injuries have not been publicly disclosed, though they were described as minor.\n\nThe driver involved in the crash — who had been hired for the trip — was also treated at a hospital and released today. However, TMZ reports that the individual could face criminal charges.\n\nAdditionally, the driver of the stationary truck that Joshua’s car hit is wanted by authorities for fleeing the scene after the fatal crash.\n\n“He could be hit with reckless driving charges as a result of Monday’s incident,” TMZ reported. “The driver of the truck that Joshua’s SUV smashed into fled the scene immediately after the crash and is now being hunted down by officials.”\n\nMeanwhile, The Guardian Nigeria cited preliminary findings suggesting a mechanical failure may have played a role in the accident.\n\n“Preliminary investigations revealed a burst tyre was responsible for the accident in which two-time heavyweight champion Joshua survived but lost two close associates,” the outlet reported, adding that the front passenger-side tyre burst, causing the vehicle to lose control before colliding with a stationary truck.\n\nIn the days following the tragedy, an outpouring of support has emerged for the victims’ families. More than $180,000 has reportedly been raised in honor of Ayodele to help fund the construction of a mosque in his memory — a gesture reflecting the deep impact he had on those around him.",

Barmore is facing a domestic assault and battery charge after his girlfriend told police he threw her to the ground in August at his home outside Boston.\n\nA criminal complaint issued Dec. 18 claims Barmore, 26, briefly took the woman's phone, threw her to the ground and grabbed her by the shirt inside the home in Mansfield, Massachusetts.\n\nMansfield Police Sgt. John Armstrong said the woman called police on Aug. 25 to report what had occurred almost three weeks earlier. The woman told police she had stayed at the home periodically during their relationship of several years.\n\nBarmore's lawyer, David Meier, issued a statement Wednesday saying “the evidence will demonstrate that no criminal conduct took place.” Meier called it a personal matter and said he expected it to be \"resolved in the near future and both parties will move forward together.”\n\nThe woman told police she took their daughter early the morning of Aug. 8 into Barmore's bedroom, where Barmore was upset because the thermostat was 2 degrees warmer than he preferred. She said their daughter wanted to see him.\n\nShe claimed Barmore “picked up the child, placed her on the floor just outside the master bedroom, turned back into the room and slammed the door shut,” according to police.\n\nAs the woman packed her belongings to leave later in the day, Barmore took the phone from her hand and disconnected a call with the woman's mother, according to the criminal complaint. When she headed for the front door to call for help, police said, Barmore allegedly “grabbed her before she could and threw her to the floor.\"\n\nBarmore grabbed her by the shirt but “eventually let go” and the woman got up, she told police. A car provided by the team picked up the woman and their daughter and drove them to Delaware. She provided police with a photo showing bruises she said occurred when she was thrown to the floor.\n\nNew England coach Mike Vrabel said Barmore was away from the team with an illness Wednesday but that he hadn’t heard anything that would make him unavailable to play Sunday.\n\n“We’ve made a statement and we’ve taken the allegations very seriously,” Vrabel said, referring to allegations against both Barmore and receiver Stefon Diggs. Diggs has been charged with felony strangulation or suffocation and misdemeanor assault and battery in a dispute with his former private chef.\n\n“I don’t think we have to jump to any sort of conclusions right now. Let the process take its toll,” Vrabel said.\n\nAn arraignment was scheduled for early February. The charge is a misdemeanor.\n\nThe team's public relations office emailed a statement saying it had been aware of the matter when it occurred and notified the league.\n\n“The matter remains part of an ongoing legal process. We will respect that process, continue to monitor the situation closely, as we have over the past few months, and cooperate fully with the league,” the Patriots said.\n\nBarmore was a second-round pick in 2021 out of the University of Alabama.\n\nScolforo reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. AP Sports Writer Kyle Hightower in Foxborough, Massachusetts, contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — New England Patriots star wide receiver Stefon Diggs is facing strangulation and other criminal charges in connection with an incident that happened earlier this month, police said.\n\nNews of the charges emerged after a court hearing Tuesday in Dedham, Massachusetts. It is unclear what led to the charges, which include felony strangulation or suffocation and misdemeanor assault and battery.\n\nDiggs’ lawyer, David Meier, said in an emailed statement that Diggs “categorically denies these allegations.”\n\nMeier said the allegations never occurred, describing them as unsubstantiated and uncorroborated.\n\n“The timing and motivation for making the allegations is crystal clear: they are the direct result of an employee-employer financial dispute that was not resolved to the employee’s satisfaction,” Meier wrote.\n\nIn a statement, the Patriots said they were also standing by Diggs: “We support Stefon,” the team said.\n\nDiggs, 32, established himself as one of the NFL’s best wide receivers during a run with Minnesota and Buffalo from 2018 to 2023, when he had six consecutive 1,000-yard receiving seasons and was selected to the Pro Bowl four times.\n\nAfter a lackluster stint in Houston last year, Diggs ended up in New England, signing a three-year, $69 million deal in free agency that guaranteed him $26 million.\n\nDiggs has proven a reliable target for second-year quarterback Drake Maye and is a big reason why the team has once again clinched the AFC East title as the team heads toward the playoffs.\n\nOff the field, though, his tenure with the Patriots got off to a rocky start when a video surfaced on social media in May showing Diggs passing what appeared to be a bag of pink crystals to women on a boat.\n\nIt wasn’t clear what the substance was, and an NFL spokesperson said the league would not comment. Patriots coach Mike Vrabel said the team would handle that matter internally.",

You must carefully place climber Aava’s hands and feet to make your way up a forbidding mountain, camping on ledges and bandaging her fingers as you go. Like real climbing, it is challenging and somewhat brutal. \n\n PC, PlayStation 5; 29 January\n\nA two-player animated horror game in the Tim Burton mode, minus all the whimsy. In a setup reminiscent of the famously discomfiting games Limbo and Inside, a brother and sister must escape a twisted mockery of their home town, finding their friends as they go. They are stalked by horrible spike-limbed monsters and grotesquely reanimated creatures. Genuinely frightening and artistically impressive. \n\n Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation5, Xbox; 13 February\n\nCapcom’s horror series is very old, but it still comes up with new ways to make your skin crawl. In Requiem we play as bookish Grace, whom the game’s director calls “the biggest scaredy-cat in Resident Evil history”, and the confidently combat-proficient cop Leon S Kennedy, pursued by monsters through the iconic Raccoon City. \n\n Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox; 27 February\n\nImagine dropping Pokémon into the world of Animal Crossing, with a hint of Minecraft’s blocky aesthetic. This family-friendly Nintendo game has you building and tending habitats for Nintendo’s beloved creatures. You play as a Ditto, the shape-shifting pink blob, which can helpfully transform into other Pokémon, using those other critters’ abilities to bring a barren landscape back to life and build a vibrant town. \n\n Nintendo Switch 2, 5 March\n\nThe most anticipated James Bond game since the Nintendo 64’s GoldenEye 007. Made by IO Interactive, famous for Hitman, it stars a younger, twentysomething Bond who has not yet earned his 007 status, and hopes to blend the expected car chases, shootouts and gadgets with some genuine spycraft, as Bond infiltrates parties and digs for information. \n\n Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox; 27 May\n\nFrom the Finnish developer behind Returnal, the exceptional, intelligent time-loop sci-fi shooter, this mysterious action game stars another stranded astronaut on a different hostile planet, one where a dying sun is sending its creatures and colonists mad. Long-time gamers will recognise the lineage of arcade bullet-hell shooters in this very modern action game. \n\n PlayStation 5; 30 April\n\nIt has been in development for more than a decade and, despite several delays (GTA VI was on this very list last year), expectations have never been higher for the biggest game in the world. It’s a crime story and a love story, featuring the series’ first female protagonist, Lucia, and her boyfriend, Jason, and set in Rockstar’s fictional Floridian state of Leonida. There has been so much to satirise about contemporary America since 2013’s GTA V that Rockstar’s writers will surely have been spoilt for choice. \n\n PlayStation 5, Xbox; 19 November\n\nThe modern Spider-Man games have gone down a storm, so it’s no surprise that developer Insomniac is now turning its attention to a different Marvel hero. This new game features an ensemble X-Men cast and a whole lot of gratuitous comic-book violence, as Wolverine sticks those adamantium claws through a succession of foes trying to chase him down. \n\n PlayStation 5; date TBC\n\nLooking for an alternative to established wizarding-school fiction? Witchbrook is a charming pixel-art slice-of-life game about a witches’ college. In school you learn spells and broom flight; outside school you involve yourself in the life of the whimsical town outside. It supports four players at once, too. \n\n PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox; TBC",

    "fullText": "A Manchester man was fined more than £1,000 ($1,333) for illegally dumping a large pile of construction waste on public property.\n\nAccording to the BBC, Stephen Cawley, 36, pleaded guilty to the illegal waste-disposal incident that happened more than two years ago.\n\nOn April 17, 2023, a massive pile of household and construction waste was found on the land next to a footpath on Altrincham Road — the same road that Cawley lives on.\n\nInvestigators traced the mysterious pile of trash to a nearby property undergoing renovations, which investigators learned was a job contracted to Cawley's building company, Builder Boys Ltd.\n\n\"So he dumped it on his own f****** road?\" one commenter asked in disbelief under a Reddit post that shared the BBC report.\n\nUsing public roads to improperly dispose of commercial or household waste is not only illegal and an eyesore, but it also costs taxpayers money. The city has to dispatch a cleanup crew to remove the trash from the roads so they are safe to use again.\n\nMany Reddit commenters took issue with the fact that Cawley, who had generated the massive pile of waste and debris through his building business, pushed the government to foot the bill.\n\nHe left the trash uncovered and unaddressed, which could have sent loose debris into waterways, polluting our oceans, or into nearby animal habitats.\n\nCawley was ordered to pay £320 to the Manchester Magistrates' Court, as well as £750 for the cost of illegal dumping. The court also imposed an additional £128 victim surcharge.\n\n\"Flytipping remains a selfish and disgusting crime which impacts our communities and environment,\" said councillor Lee-Ann Igbon, per BBC.\n\nDo you think the construction industry is too wasteful?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nProtecting public spaces and the environment from illegal waste dumps ensures that everyone has the chance to experience the natural world as it should be.\n\nAnother Reddit commenter grumbled about the punishment issued.\n\n\"Still seems cheaper than getting rid of it properly,\" another Reddit user added.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) — Legislators in Algeria voted to declare France’s colonization of the North African country a crime, approving a law that calls for restitution of property taken by France during its 130-year rule, among other demands seeking to redress historical wrongs.\n\nFrance slammed the law as a “hostile act” threatening bilateral efforts to heal wounds of the past. The two countries retain close cultural and economic ties but have troubled diplomatic relations.\n\nIn a solemn ceremony steeped in symbolism, 340 of 407 members of Algeria’s National Assembly voted late Wednesday to approve the law. The move came just a few weeks after African countries made a collective resolution for recognition and reparations for colonial-era crimes.\n\nThe law covers the period from the landing of King Charles X’s army on the beaches of Sidi Ferruch west of Algiers in 1830 to July 5, 1962, the date of Algeria’s official independence.\n\nThe text provides for the restitution of Algerian archives and property moved to France during the colonial period, and the transmission to Algiers of detailed maps of French nuclear tests conducted in Algeria from 1960 to 1966. It also calls for the repatriation of the remains of some Algerian resistance fighters taken to France.\n\nThe law stipulates prison sentences for any action by an Algerian celebrating French colonialism, for attacks on symbols of the Algerian resistance, and “remarks with colonial connotations.”\n\nFrance is unlikely to heed the demands in the law.\n\nThe law is “a manifestly hostile initiative,” the French Foreign Ministry spokesperson's office said in a statement to The Associated Press. It noted efforts under French President Emmanuel Macron to address colonial-era grievances, and added: “We continue to work toward the renewal of dialogue,” notably about security and migration issues.\n\nMacron, in 2017, described elements of France’s history in Algeria as a crime against humanity, but stopped short of an official apology. Meanwhile, the resurgent far right in France celebrates colonialists.\n\nThe economic cost of colonialism in Africa is believed to be staggering. Algeria suffered some of the most brutal forms of French colonial rule.\n\nNearly a million European settlers held greater political, economic and social privileges, even though Algeria was legally part of France and its men were conscripted in World War II. Hundreds of thousands died in Algeria’s revolution, during which French forces tortured detainees, disappeared suspects and devastated villages as part of a counterinsurgency strategy to maintain their grip on power.\n\nHuge Algerian flags adorned the lower house of parliament as speaker Mohamed Boughali delivered his opening address Wednesday.\n\n“Today, December 24, 2025, is a historic day, to be written in letters of gold in the national narrative,” he began, before being interrupted by lawmakers intoning an excerpt from the Algerian national anthem: “O France, the hour of reckoning has arrived … we have sworn to revive Algeria, bear witness!

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Lawyers for former CIA Director John Brennan want the Justice Department to be prevented from steering an investigation of him and other former government officials to a “favored” judge in Florida who dismissed the classified documents case against President Donald Trump.\n\nThe request Monday is addressed to U.S. District Judge Cecilia Altonaga, the chief judge in the Southern District of Florida, where federal prosecutors are pursuing a criminal investigation related to the U.S. government assessment of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Brennan and other former officials have received subpoenas, and Brennan's lawyers say he's been advised by prosecutors that he's a target of the investigation.\n\nBrennan's lawyers say in their letter that they are concerned the Justice Department is engaged in “judge-shopping” and trying to arrange for the investigation to be transferred to U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who issued favorable rulings to Trump during the classified documents case and dismissed it last year. They asked Altonaga to exercise her “supervisory authority” as chief judge to ensure the Justice Department is unable to steer the current Russia-related matter to her.\n\n“In short, we are seeking assurance that any litigation arising out of this grand jury proceeding will be heard by a judge who is selected by the court’s neutral and impartial processes, not by the prosecution’s self-interested maneuvering contrary to the interests of justice,” wrote Brennan's attorneys, Kenneth Wainstein and Natasha Harnwell-Davis. The New York Times earlier reported on the letter.\n\nIt remains unclear what specific allegations of criminal conduct are being examined by prosecutors in Florida. But the subpoenas issued last month to Brennan and other former law enforcement and intelligence officials sought documents related to the preparation of the Obama administration’s intelligence community assessment, made public in January 2017, that detailed how Russia waged a covert influence campaign to help Trump defeat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump was investigated, but not charged, during his first term over whether his campaign conspired with Russia to tip the outcome of the election. He has long sought retribution over the Russia investigation and the officials who played a key part in it.\n\nHis Justice Department in September secured a false statement and obstruction indictment against James Comey, the FBI director at the time the Russia probe was launched, though the case against him was dismissed. Its future is in doubt thanks to a judge's ruling that blocked prosecutors, in the event they try to revive the case, from relying on communications they consider to be key evidence.\n\nBrennan's lawyers say the Trump administration Justice Department tried to “forum-shop” the investigation of him to multiple jurisdictions, including Pennsylvania, before settling in Florida. But they say prosecutors have been unable to answer basic questions about why Florida is a proper venue for the investigation given that the intelligence community assessment at issue was produced by officials in the Washington, D.C., area.\n\nThough it is not clear that the Justice Department will ultimately produce charges, Brennan's request reflects the fact that judges who oversee grand jury investigations can be called upon to make important decisions and resolve significant disputes, including over witness testimony, that can affect the course of the inquiry.\n\nThe grand jury investigation is currently based in the Miami division of the Southern District of Florida, but Brennan's lawyers say they're concerned that the Trump administration may be poised to try to transfer the case to the smaller Fort Pierce division, where Cannon is the only judge. They cited as a basis for that alarm a Justice Department decision to seek an additional grand jury in Fort Pierce even though, Brennan's lawyers say, there's no apparent caseload need.\n\n“The United States Attorney’s efforts to funnel this investigation to the judge who issued this string of rulings that consistently favored President Trump’s positions in previous litigations should be seen for what it is,” Brennan's lawyers wrote.",

Investigators said Ukraine may be behind the attack.\n\nLt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov, head of the Operational Training Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces' General Staff, died from his injuries, said Svetlana Petrenko, the spokesperson for Russia’s Investigative Committee, the nation's top criminal investigation agency.\n\n“Investigators are pursuing numerous lines of inquiry regarding the murder. One of these is that the crime was orchestrated by Ukrainian intelligence services,” Petrenko said.\n\nSince Moscow sent troops into Ukraine nearly four years ago, Russian authorities have blamed Ukraine for several assassinations of military officers and public figures in Russia. Ukraine has claimed responsibility for some of them. It has not yet commented on Monday's death.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that President Vladimir Putin had been immediately informed about Sarvarov's killing.\n\nThe Defense Ministry said that Sarvarov had previously fought in Chechnya and taken part in Moscow's military campaign in Syria.\n\nJust over a year ago, Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the chief of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed by a bomb hidden on an electric scooter outside his apartment building. Kirillov's assistant also died. Ukraine’s security service claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nAn Uzbek man was quickly arrested and charged with killing Kirillov on behalf of the Ukrainian security service.\n\nPutin described Kirillov’s killing as a “major blunder” by Russia’s security agencies, noting they should learn from it and improve their efficiency.\n\nIn April, another senior Russian military officer, Lt. Gen. Yaroslav Moskalik, a deputy head of the main operational department in the General Staff, was killed by an explosive device placed in his car parked near his apartment building just outside Moscow. A suspected perpetrator was quickly arrested.\n\nDays after Moskalik's killing, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he received a report from the head of Ukraine’s foreign intelligence agency on the “liquidation” of top Russian military figures, adding that “justice inevitably comes\" although he didn't mention Moskalik's name.",

    "fullText": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee's governor pardoned country star Jelly Roll on Thursday for his criminal past in the state, acknowledging the Nashville native's long road back from drugs and prison through soul-searching, songwriting and advocacy for second chances.\n\nThe rapper-turned-singer whose legal name is Jason Deford has spoken for years about his redemption arc before diverse audiences, from people serving time in correctional centers to concert crowds and even in testimony before Congress.\n\nRepublican Gov. Bill Lee issued the pardon after friends and civic leaders of the Grammy-nominated musician joined in an outpouring of support.\n\nJelly Roll's convictions include robbery and drug felonies. He has said a pardon would make it easier for him to travel internationally for concert tours and to perform Christian missionary work without filling out burdensome paperwork.\n\nHe was one of 33 people to receive pardons Thursday from Lee, who for years has issued clemency decisions around the Christmas season. Lee said Jelly Roll’s application underwent the same monthslong thorough review as other applicants. The state parole board gave a nonbinding, unanimous recommendation for Jelly Roll's pardon in April.\n\n“His story is remarkable, and it’s a redemptive, powerful story, which is what you look for and what you hope for,” Lee told reporters.\n\nJelly Roll and Lee meet at the governor's mansion\n\nLee said he never met Jelly Roll until Thursday, when the musician visited the governor's mansion over the pardon news. The two hugged in front of a lit Christmas tree and a fireplace decorated with holiday garlands.\n\nUnlike recent high-profile federal pardons, which let people off the hook for prison, a Tennessee pardon serves as a statement of forgiveness for someone who has already completed a prison sentence. Pardons offer a path to restoring certain civil rights such as the right to vote, although there are some legal limitations, and the governor can specify the terms.\n\nJelly Roll broke into country music with the 2023 album “Whitsitt Chapel” and crossover songs like “Need a Favor.” He has won multiple CMT Awards, a CMA Award and also picked up seven career Grammy nominations.\n\nMuch of his music deals with overcoming adversity, like the song “Winning Streak” about someone’s first day sober. Or the direct-and-to-the-point, “I Am Not Okay.”\n\n\"When I first started doing this, I was just telling my story of my broken self,” he told The Associated Press in an interview. “By the time I got through it, I realized that my story was the story of many. So now I’m not telling my story anymore. I’m getting to pull it right from the crevices of the people whose story’s never been told.”\n\nJelly Roll: '‘I was a part of the problem’\n\nBefore the parole board, Jelly Roll said he first fell in love with songwriting while in custody, calling music a therapeutic passion project that “would end up changing my life in ways that I never dreamed imaginable.”\n\nOutside of sold-out shows, he's testified before the U.S. Senate about the dangers of fentanyl, describing his drug-dealing younger self as “the uneducated man in the kitchen playing chemist with drugs I knew absolutely nothing about.”\n\n“I was a part of the problem,” he told lawmakers at the time. “I am here now standing as a man that wants to be a part of the solution.”\n\nJelly Roll's most serious convictions include a robbery at 17 and drug charges at 23. In the first case, a female acquaintance helped Jelly Roll and two armed accomplices steal $350 from people in a home in 2002. Because the victims knew the female acquaintance, she and Jelly Roll were quickly arrested. Jelly Roll was unarmed, and was sentenced to one year in prison plus probation.\n\nIn another run-in 2008, police found marijuana and crack cocaine in his car, leading to eight years of court-ordered supervision.\n\nSheriff whose jail held Jelly Roll urged a pardon\n\nFriends and civic leaders cited his transformation in backing a pardon.\n\nDavidson County Sheriff Daron Hall, who runs Nashville’s jail, wrote that Jelly Roll had an awakening in one of the jails he managed. Live Nation Entertainment CEO and President Michael Rapino cited Jelly Roll's donations from his performances to charities for at-risk youth.\n\n“I think he has a chance and is in the process of rehabilitating a generation, and that’s not just words,” Hall said in a phone interview Thursday. \"I’m talking about what I see we need in our country, is people who accept responsibility, accept the fact that they make mistakes and accept the fact that they need help.\"\n\nThe parole board began considering Jelly Roll’s pardon application in October 2024, which marks the state's five-year timeline for eligibility after his sentence expired. Prominent Nashville attorney David Raybin represented Jelly Roll in the pardon case.\n\nLee's office said no one was pardoned Thursday who had a homicide or a sex-related conviction, or for any crime committed as an adult against a minor.",

    "fullText": "The University of Michigan is not firing the woman involved in the \"inappropriate\" relationship with Sherrone Moore.\n\nMoore, the program's football coach, was fired for having an \"inappropriate\" relationship with a female staff member. He was later arrested on criminal trespassing and stalking charges, after learning of his firing. Michigan said in a statement last Wednesday night, December 10, that Moore was being fired immediately.\n\n“When the findings of a university investigation into Coach Moore’s behavior were presented on Wednesday, we immediately terminated his employment,” Grasso wrote in a letter to the university,\" the school's president said.\n\n“There is absolutely no tolerance for this conduct at the University of Michigan. None.”\n\nBut while Moore was fired for having the \"inappropriate\" relationship with the staff member, the woman - who also hid the relationship from the school for months, if not longer - is not being fired.\n\nThe University of Michigan announced that the woman is still employed by the university.\n\nThe school's policy does not apply to her. It only applied to Moore, since he was the person in power, according to USA TODAY.\n\n“Recognizing that Intimate Relationships exist or may develop in the workplace that are not initiated by a Supervisor and are free from coercion and abuse of power, immediate disclosure of the relationship by the Supervisor is required,” the policy states. “Failure of the Supervisor to disclose an Intimate Relationship is a serious offense and cause for discipline, up to and including dismissal from employment.”\n\nThe woman was technically encouraged to share news of the relationship with the school, though she wasn't required to do so.\n\n“Although encouraged, Supervisees have no obligation to disclose,” the policy states.\n\nThe school recognizes that the person in the relationship who has more power at the school has the opportunity to abuse said power. The person without it has less.\n\n“Intimate Relationships initiated by a Supervisor are at high risk of being unwelcomed and experienced by the Supervisee as harassment,” the policy states. “Supervisors are therefore responsible for understanding how their statements and conduct may reasonably be interpreted by persons who do not share their same level of power.”\n\nThe school clearly outlines its rules in Policy No. 201.97.\n\nIt states that a supervisor may not “implicitly or explicitly, initiate or attempt to initiate an intimate relationship with a supervisee.”\n\nSo it was Moore, who has been married for 10 years with three children, that was the one at fault.",

    "fullText": "WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) — A judge on Monday disbarred Hunter Biden in Connecticut for violating the state's attorney conduct rules, a decision that comes after complaints were made about the federal gun and tax charges Biden was convicted of before being pardoned last year by his father, former President Joe Biden.\n\nIn an agreement with the state office that disciplines lawyers, Hunter Biden consented to being disbarred and admitted to attorney misconduct, but he did not admit to any criminal wrongdoing. He was disbarred in Washington, D.C., in May.\n\nHunter Biden did not speak as he and his lawyer, Ross Garber, appeared via video at a virtual court hearing before Judge Trial Referee Patrick L. Carroll III in Waterbury.\n\nHunter Biden was convicted last year in Delaware federal court of three felonies for purchasing a gun in 2018 when, prosecutors said, he lied on a federal form by claiming he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs.\n\nHe had been set to stand trial in September 2024 in a California case in which prosecutors accused him of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in federal taxes. He agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor and felony charges hours after jury selection was set to begin.\n\nThe Connecticut judge found that Hunter Biden violated several ethical rules for lawyers, including engaging in conduct “involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\" In a court document, Hunter Biden admitted to some but not all of the misconduct allegations. The judge also cited the Washington disbarment.\n\nPaul Dorsey, one of the two people who filed the complaints about the former president's son, told the judge during Monday's hearing that he objected to the agreement because Hunter Biden did not admit to committing crimes. But Leanne Larson, an attorney with the Office of Chief Disciplinary Counsel, cited the pardon.\n\nHunter Biden was admitted to the Connecticut bar in 1997, a year after graduating from Yale Law School.",

    "description": "Andrew Left is headed for a big legal fight in 2026. Business Insider viewed his conversation with Claude to see how he's prepping for the case.",
    "fullText": "Famed short-seller Andrew Left is in the legal fight of his life, set to stand trial in March on allegations of market manipulation and making false and misleading social-media posts about his trading plans.\n\nAs he prepares to battle the feds, one of the places he's gone to for help is Claude. No, that's not the name of his defense lawyer. Claude, in this case, is Anthropic's popular AI chatbot.\n\nBusiness Insider recently got a look at how Left is using artificial intelligence in connection with his criminal case when he included a chat log during an email exchange with us.\n\nIt showed Left peppering Claude with questions and even asking it to draft a letter that his human legal team could, hypothetically, send to the Department of Justice.\n\nIt started with a simple but important question from the outspoken investor behind Citron Research: \"is this good or bad for andrew left\".\n\nLeft, who said he didn't mean to send the chat log to Business Insider, later explained he had uploaded to Claude a document related to his case and wanted a quick, easy-to-understand analysis.\n\n\"If you're ever in a court case, you just get something from the DOJ — instead of reading eight pages, you just put it into AI,\" he said after Business Insider asked him about the log. \"You go, 'What does this mean?'\"\n\nLeft, 55, became something of a market celebrity a decade ago after he raised serious claims about the business practices of Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which was later investigated by federal prosecutors, regulators, and Congress.\n\nHe has also predicted the business woes of companies like Nikola and Hertz, which gave his research reports market-moving sway.\n\nIn filing criminal charges last year, federal prosecutors alleged that Left took trading positions contrary to those market moves in order to reap quick profits. They say he manipulated prices over roughly five years across at least 23 different stocks and made false statements to regulators about coordinating his trades with hedge funds.\n\nThe docket for his case shows seven attorneys who previously or currently represent Left. But Claude, which has been gaining traction with lawyers, apparently came in handy one day last month.\n\nEric Rosen, a partner at Dynamis LLP, one of the firms representing Left, told Business Insider that AI can be valuable as a tool for understanding complex legal materials but cautioned against relying on it too much.\n\n\"It gives you a lot of feedback that you want to hear,\" he said. \"But, you don't know how a judge is going to react to some of these arguments.\"\n\nAlthough Business Insider only saw a portion of Left's conversation with Claude, it was clear that the document he uploaded had something to do with Nvidia. That made sense since the federal indictment alleges Left took a bullish position in the chipmaker's stock in November 2018, tweeted a lofty price target for it, then sold shares hours later, after they spiked.\n\nIn an answer to Left's query about the document, Claude had what sounded like good news, saying it revealed \"critical weaknesses\" in the government's case that was \"potentially very good\" for him.\n\nIt then listed four \"major problems\" with the Justice Department case and offered four \"best defenses\":\n\nLeft volleyed back at the chatbot, playfully patting himself on the back — and Claude gave him positive reinforcement.\n\nThe chatbot then singled out a specific thing that Left had tweeted, that Nvidia would reach \"$165 before $120.\" (It was at about $144 at the time.) Claude pointed out that the stock actually bottomed out at $124 in December before rising to $160 by June 2019.\n\n\"You were spectacularly right at a critical inflection point,\" the chatbot reassured Left.\n\nIn the same response, Claude broke down what it sees as the \"real issue\":\n\nLeft's next two prompts dealt with a stock split announced by Nvidia. The end goal of his inquiries was to show that — factoring in splits — he was directionally correct with his bullish price target on Nvidia stock.\n\nAfter Claude laid out an analysis reassuring Left that his Nvidia forecast was ultimately correct, he followed up with:\n\nAnd then here's what Claude said about the \"legal implication\":\n\n(Note that the supposed 1,300% gain is based on an incorrectly calculated current stock price for Nvidia. It is trading at around $176 a share, not the split-adjusted $1,931 used by Claude.)\n\nLeft wasn't done. He asked Claude to put all his responses into a letter addressed to the DOJ from his attorney. His only suggestion was to make it \"not AI sounding.\"\n\nAfter it returned a roughly 250-word block of text, Left had another edit:\n\nThat got it down to about 150 words. What next?\n\nEver-obedient, Claude spat out this:\n\nMatthew Cain, whose name surfaced when Claude analyzed the document, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLeft said that for him, the AI served as a kind of thought partner.\n\n\"I was writing because I wanted to figure out, as we were going into this case and my attorneys met with the Department of Justice, how to try and explain it,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nLeft noted that he'd seen the AI misinterpret the law, but he does not worry about the chatbot's hallucinations.\n\n\"I run all ideas to just see the other side of the argument,\" he said. \"It definitely opens your mind up, but you cannot rely on it for matters of law.\"\n\nAnthropic, the makers of the Claude chatbot, did not respond to Business Insider's request for a comment. The Justice Department also did not comment.\n\nIt's not clear if Claude's text for a letter ever made its way to Left's defense team or to prosecutors, but he didn't sell it short to us. In fact, he told Business Insider that Claude is his favorite AI.",

    "fullText": "GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala (AP) — Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo on Sunday said he had declared a state of emergency in two municipalities in western Guatemala a day after armed men attacked a military post and a police station, cut off roads and hijacked buses, killing at least five people.\n\nCriminal gangs are attempting to force security forces to withdraw in order to take control of the region, Arévalo said. He said his government would reinforce security.\n\nThis state of emergency, the first declared by his government, will last for 15 days in the municipalities of Nahuala and Santa Catarina Ixtahuacan in the department of Solola.\n\n“We are at a critical moment for the department of Solola and the security of the country,” Arévalo said, accompanied Interior Minister Marco Villeda and José Giovanni Martínez Milán, the acting Defense Minister and head of General Staff.\n\nArévalo showed videos and photos from Saturday’s events, in which armed men - some dressed in camouflage or military uniforms, wearing helmets and bulletproof vests and carrying high-caliber weapons - can be seen shooting or taking cover just meters away from a busy main road.\n\nThe criminal groups are linked to extortion and drug trafficking and pose a threat to the local communities, Arévalo said.\n\n“The communities are not alone,” he said.\n\nInterior Minister Marco Villeda said that five people had died. On Saturday, the director of the National Civil Police, David Botero, said that six people had died, including a soldier.\n\nThe incidents are believed to have started last Thursday when armed men attacked the military post, leaving four people wounded at that time.\n\nThe two municipalities have had disputes for several decades over water sources and local roads they both claim as their own. These disputes have led to dozens of deaths.\n\n“In this case, there was no attack between the communities. This was an attack on the military post, intentionally and specifically,” Arévalo said.\n\nThe state of emergency limits the rights to open-air meetings, public demonstrations and events. It allows for the dissolution by force of any unauthorized gatherings, groups, or public demonstrations, particularly those involving weapons or violent acts.\n\nIt also limits the right to protests that affect free movement or public services, which can be forcibly dissolved, and restricts the right to carry weapons.",

    "title": "Faking insanity: Forensic psychologists detect signs of malingering. (2012)",
    "description": "When someone commits a horrific, inexplicable crime, we naturally wonder whether he’s mentally ill: Who but a crazy person could do such a thing? But...",
    "fullText": "When someone commits a horrific, inexplicable crime, we naturally wonder whether he’s mentally ill: Who but a crazy person could do such a thing? But when a killer acts crazy after his arrest, we also might wonder whether he’s preparing for his trial. That’s the speculation around Colorado shooter James Holmes, whose psychiatric treatment and bizarre behavior in court and prison make people wonder whether he’s truly insane or building a case for an insanity defense. It leads to the question: Can a criminal get away with faking insanity?\n\nExperts have been debating that question since the creation of the insanity defense in the mid-19th century. To avoid the noose or the guillotine, criminals of the era would fake symptoms from the then-emerging field of psychology. It soon became a cat-and-mouse game: Criminals would act out their understanding of insane behaviors, and alienists (the era’s term for psychologists) would write studies on how to detect those “malingerers.” Most techniques relied on the investigators’ experience and powers of observation—looking for inconsistencies in symptoms, waiting until the suspect tired of the game, or simply catching a telltale look in his eye. As the Austrian criminologist Hans Gross wrote: “The shammer, when he thinks no one is looking, casts a swift and scrutinizing glance on the Investigating Officer to see whether or not he believes him.”\n\nToday, less than 1 percent of felony defendants raise an insanity defense, and a tiny fraction of those succeed. Yet in a state like Colorado, where proving insanity can avert a death sentence, the temptation to appear mentally ill must be strong. And so modern forensic psychologists, just like their forebears, watch for malingering with a sharp clinical eye. They determine whether the symptoms match those of well-studied pathologies and whether the signs remain consistent over time. They also can apply a battery of tests that essentially fake-out the faker.\n\nThe first step is to do a thorough review of the suspect’s history. Mental illness doesn’t develop overnight, so it’s important to know if the person has been hospitalized or treated for similar symptoms. The investigators also review the crime-scene report. If the suspect has hidden the weapon, washed off his fingerprints, or taken other steps to elude the police, it’s a sign of clear thinking—not mental illness.\n\nThen come one or more long, rambling interviews—the longer the better, because after a few hours, some suspects begin to lose track of their symptoms or grow weary of the con. Phillip J. Resnick, professor of psychiatry at Case Western Reserve University, says he asks the suspect to talk at length about his history before saying a word about the crime, to lessen the chance of “retrofitting” a pattern of alleged illness to the deed. He and his colleagues listen carefully for signs of particular mental illnesses.\n\n“Most malingerers don’t read the psychological literature,” says Tali Walters, a Boston forensic psychologist, so they present a Hollywood version of how a crazy person acts.\n\nFor example, some suspects claim to hear voices in their head that they’re powerless to resist, a commonly dramatized depiction of schizophrenia. Unlike what we see in the movies, most auditory hallucinations are benign; they seem to originate outside the head (not inside), and rarely come from aliens or other non-human beings. Only a small percentage are “command hallucinations,” and even fewer command a violent act. Furthermore, genuine schizophrenics find strategies to ignore these voices, or even make peace with them. They learn that certain activities, such as exercise, mute the voices; while others, such as watching TV, encourage them—the “voice” can’t seem to resist commenting on what it sees.\n\nSo if a suspect says he feels compelled to obey alien voices inside his head telling him to kill, there’s a good chance he’s feigning. Case in point: David Berkowitz, aka “Son of Sam,” who shot six people in a three-year murder spree in New York. Berkowitz claimed that he was following the commands of a demon-possessed Labrador retriever, but later admitted it was a hoax. “A dog,” says Resnick, “is not a typical [auditory] hallucination.”\n\nMalingerers often exaggerate their symptoms and ignore common, subtle signs such as the blunting of a mentally ill patient’s emotions. Some fakers say one thing and do another. They might feign confusion to the psychiatrist but later converse easily with cell-mates, or claim to be paranoid while sitting at ease. Some combine symptoms from different conditions, such as hallucinations of schizophrenia and obscene outbursts found in Tourette’s syndrome. The forensic psychologist may suggest an outrageous delusion during the interview, such as, “Do you believe cars are part of an organized religion?” Fakers might latch onto this bait and perhaps even run with it. Real schizophrenics would say no.\n\nAt some point the examiner leads the discussion to the crime, which sets another trip-wire for deceivers. No matter how delusional the suspect claims to be, the crime scene must fit the hallucinations he describes. It’s hard to believe a suspect who says he was slashing wildly with a kitchen knife against an army of aliens when he actually left a single stab wound in his mother’s chest. Another clue is a cover story that conveniently mixes delusion and reality.\n\n“Sometimes all it takes is one sentence,” says Resnick. “It’s one thing to say ‘God told me to kill my mother to save all mankind.” It’s quite another to say, “God told me to kill my mother so I could get money to buy more drugs.”\n\nThere are also standardized tests that trip up malingerers. A preliminary, 10-minute test, called M-FAST (Miller Forensic Assessment of Symptoms Test), presents a series 25 questions that intermix phony and real symptoms. It’s almost impossible to pick the right combinations if you’re not mentally ill or a highly trained forensic psychologist. A more thorough series of questions, called SIRS (Structured Interview of Reported Symptoms) takes about an hour.\n\nThere’s even a test for faking amnesia, which is among the most common of feigned mental illnesses. Contrary to popular belief, people with amnesia don’t completely lose their ability to remember things. So forensic psychologists give a memory test that’s so easy that even a person with amnesia could pass it. They show a series of letters, numbers, and shapes for a few seconds and then ask him to draw them on a blank sheet of paper. Even people with amnesia caused by brain damage can reproduce most of the symbols. The only way to fail is if you do so on purpose. “I don’t want to be so specific that people can avoid our detection methods,” says Jerry J. Sweet, director of neuropsychology for the North Shore University Health System in Evanston, Ill. “So in this case we try not to educate the public.”\n\nThe psychologists and psychiatrists interviewed for this story were hesitant to comment on the Holmes case, not having seen the suspect or his file. But they voiced suspicion over his claimed amnesia, which is exceedingly rare without brain injury, drugs, or another medical condition. Walters cautioned that even though Holmes’ psychiatrist reportedly sent a warning to the University of Colorado’s threat team, it’s not clear whether the behavior that triggered the warning resulted directly from mental illness.\n\nSurveys show that of the roughly 60,000 “competency to stand trial” referrals forensic psychologists evaluate each year, anywhere from 8 percent to 17 percent of the suspects are found to be faking it.\n\nProbably the most brilliant malingerer ever was the mafia chieftain Vincent Gigante, dubbed “Oddfather” by the New York press for his strange behavior. For decades, he shuffled about Greenwich Village in his pajamas, talking to parking meters, slobbering, and muttering to show mental incompetence. When brought up on charges of conspiracy to commit murder and racketeering, he fooled several leading psychologists and delayed the trial for half a dozen years. Even after he was sent to jail in 1997, he maintained the appearance of insanity. It wasn’t until 2003, when he plea-bargained his way out of more serious charges, that Gigante admitted it had all been a sham.",

    "description": "Carl Rinsch was found guilty of defrauding Netflix when he went on a spending spree instead of finishing \"White Horse.\" We got some of the footage.",
    "fullText": "When Netflix executives first saw a glimpse of \"White Horse\" in 2018, they were blown away.\n\nCindy Holland, who at the time oversaw the streaming service's original content, read the script sitting in Keanu Reeves' home, she said in court testimony earlier this month. \"White Horse\" was the brainchild of Carl Rinsch, who had previously directed Reeves in the big-budget \"47 Ronin.\"\n\nAt the time, Rinsch had already created a trailer and six preliminary episodes of \"White Horse,\" funded in part with his own money. Holland testified she found the footage \"stunning\" and the script \"really impressive.\"\n\n\"I believed we should pursue the project,\" testified Holland, who is now an executive at Paramount.\n\nNetflix agreed to pay tens of millions of dollars on the project, but \"White Horse\" was never finished. Instead of premiering on the nation's biggest streaming platform, \"White Horse\" has become the subject of legal disputes, news articles, and, finally, a criminal trial against Rinsch in Manhattan federal court.\n\nIt culminated in a guilty verdict on Thursday, where a jury found Rinsch guilty of defrauding Netflix by using the $11 million on a personal spending spree.\n\nOver the years, the public has seen very little of the sci-fi passion project that wowed Netflix executives into shelling out $55 million for the project — until now.\n\nWhite Horse\" depicts a world with artificially created \"Organic Intelligence\" beings, which resemble humans. When the world discovers they're not flesh-and-blood humans, the artificial beings create their own private cities, walled off from the rest of the world, and form their own society.\n\nIn 2018, Netflix agreed to pay $44 million for Rinsch to deliver about 13 episodes, ranging from about four to 14 minutes and totaling about 120 minutes. It gave Rinsch an additional $11 million in March 2020 to finish \"White Horse\" — money the jury found he spent on luxury goods instead of finishing the show.\n\nThe lack of public images has made it difficult to understand why a major entertainment company would agree to spend $55 million on \"White Horse\" and why Netflix continued to infuse cash into the project after Rinsch exceeded his initial budget.\n\nNetflix even gave Rinsch coveted \"final cut\" privilege, effectively giving him ultimate creative control over what \"White Horse\" would look like, despite \"47 Ronin\" flopping at the box office.\n\nSome of the work that went into the production made it into the evidentiary material for Rinsch's trial, including six episodes that Rinsch created with his own money, before Netflix agreed to invest in the project.\n\nProsecutors played the trailer for jurors, then asked former Netflix executives about their high hopes for \"White Horse\" — and the disappointment and anxiety that followed as the production fell apart.\n\nPeter Friedlander, another Netflix executive, testified early in the trial that he was \"blown away\" by Rinsch's \"visionary\" footage.\n\n\"The visuals were something that I had never seen before,\" Friedlander said.\n\nRinsch's defense lawyers showed jurors concept art that Rinsch and his production team created to illustrate the elaborate sci-fi world the director had built. Rinsch — a protégé of \"Alien\" and \"Gladiator\" director Ridley Scott — described \"White Horse\" as a potential franchise on par with \"Star Wars\" and \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nAfter Netflix agreed to pay Rinsch for the project, the writer-director-producer spent months filming hundreds of hours of footage in Brazil, Uruguay, and Hungary, using the production codename \"Conquest.\"\n\nAccording to federal prosecutors, Rinsch \"abandoned\" \"White Horse\" after running out of money in the fall of 2019. He swindled Netflix out of the additional $11 million the streaming service agreed to pay him the following March, prosecutors said.\n\nDuring closing arguments, Rinsch's attorney Daniel McGuinness urged the jurors to watch the six episodes — which totaled about 40 minutes — while they deliberated the verdict.\n\nIt was absurd, McGuinness said, to think that Rinsch planned to scam Netflix through the production of the project when he had put so much creative energy into making it a reality.\n\nAccording to Rinsch's defense attorneys, the director believed that the bulk of the $11 million March 2020 payment was meant to reimburse him for cost overruns he had paid out of his own pocket.\n\nRinsch continued to work on \"White Horse\" throughout 2020 and in 2021, his lawyers said.\n\nTo demonstrate this, the attorneys pointed to additional concept art that he had commissioned and created himself.\n\nThe artwork featured architectural and costume designs, which Rinsch said would go toward a potential second season.\n\nMuch of the concept art depicted scenes in a castle. Trial records showed that Rinsch booked Palais Liechtenstein, a castle in Vienna. Rinsch testified he wanted to film additional scenes there, but he believed Netflix decided to scrap \"White Horse\" altogether before that could happen.\n\nAccording to one draft of Rinsch's screenplay, two twin-like \"Organic Intelligence\" beings would rule over their society and then betray each other in a Shakespearean fashion, legal records show.\n\nThe concept images for the unfinished scenes, entered into evidence in Rinsch's criminal trial, depict an apparent murder, with one of the beings lying on the floor in a pool of golden blood. The scene is not included in Rinsch's preliminary episodes.\n\nProsecutors said Rinsch's concept art was a fig leaf. Pointing to an agreement between him and Netflix, they said Rinsch was supposed to spend the entire $11 million infusion on finishing the first season — not just a small fraction of the sum for concept art. One prosecutor described the funds Rinsch paid to book the castle as \"a $30,000 down payment on an $11 million fraud.\"\n\nOne of the prosecution's arguments centered on Rinsch's purchase of multiple Rolls-Royces.\n\nRinsch testified that the cars would be used for what he called the \"Calvacade\" — a procession of cars that shuttled diplomats through the \"no man's land\" between the \"Organic Intelligence\" beings' independent cities and the human world.\n\nIn closing arguments, Assistant US Attorney David Markewitz turned the concept art against Rinsch.\n\nHe pointed the jury to planning documents that showed he had planned to shoot the \"Calvacade\" scenes in Brazil in 2019 — two years before he purchased the Rolls-Royces under his own name. On insurance records, Rinsch had said the cars were for himself, not for a Netflix production.\n\n\"At an even more basic level, you know it would make no sense to actually buy five Rolls-Royces just to shoot a few scenes with them,\" Markewitz told the jury.\"\n\nShortly before a sober-faced jury walked out of the deliberation room and announced they found him guilty of all counts, Rinsch said he was happy a journalist at Business Insider had watched the six preliminary episodes and understood his vision.\n\n\"I'm glad you watched it,\" he told Business Insider. \"It means a lot to me.\"",

    "fullText": "An Oregon company bent on selling illegal \"defeat devices\" paid a hefty price.\n\nIn August, Diamond Eye Manufacturing settled a lawsuit with the Environmental Protection Agency, agreeing to fork over $265,000 and post an announcement of the settlement on its website for eight weeks.\n\nThe company had to destroy its inventory of illegal parts. It also had to notify customers of the settlement and that it cannot provide technical support or honor warranty claims for the illegal parts, according to the EPA.\n\nThe regulator said the Athena-based business sold 33,134 illegal parts from 2017 to 2019 \"that allowed for the removal of a vehicle's emission control components.\"\n\nThe Oregon Capital Chronicle reported that the EPA came after fabricators after first targeting distributors of the products.\n\n\"All we do is bend tubes into crazy shapes for trucks.

As the Capital Chronicle reported, Diamond Eye sold pipes marketed by distributors as \"cat delete.\" A catalytic converter is a device that captures harmful gases from exhaust and makes them less harmful before they're discharged into the environment.\n\nIn December, engine manufacturer Cummins agreed to pay $1.675 billion to settle a Department of Justice lawsuit in which it was accused of installing these defeat or delete devices on nearly one million Ram trucks in violation of the Clean Air Act.\n\nIn September, the DOJ cracked down on the illegal devices, charging eBay with facilitating the sale of hundreds of thousands of products that allow drivers to partake in the dangerous practice of \"rolling coal.\"\n\nThe EPA also reached settlements with six other companies that sold defeat devices, though only one faced a fine in the range of Diamond Eye's: Auburn, Washington-based Competition Specialties, which paid $225,368.\n\nIt noted nitrogen oxides, non-methane hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter increased by 310, 1,140, 120, and 40 times respectively in vehicles without emissions controls. Over the last four years, it shut 172 civil cases, raking in $55.5 million in penalties and 17 criminal cases.\n\n\"Defeat devices enable more air pollution from vehicles to the detriment of Americans' health, and EPA is vigilant about holding accountable the entities that sell these illegal products,\" EPA Pacific Southwest regional administrator Martha Guzman said. \"These settlements demonstrate EPA's commitment to enforcing critical environmental laws that protect clean air and public health.\"\n\nJoin our free newsletter for cool news and actionable info that makes it easy to help yourself while helping the planet.",

    "fullText": "The sheer scope of cybercrime can be hard to fathom, even when you live and breathe it every day. It's not just the volume of data, but also the extent to which it replicates across criminal actors seeking to abuse it for their own gain, and to our detriment.\n\nWe were reminded of this recently when the FBI reached out and asked if they could send us 630 million more passwords. For the last four years, they've been sending over passwords found during the course of their investigations in the hope that we can help organisations block them from future use. Back then, we were supporting 1.26 billion searches of the service each month. Now, it's... more:\n\nJust as it's hard to wrap your head around the scale of cybercrime, I find it hard to grasp that number fully. On average, that service is hit nearly 7 thousand times per second, and at peak, it's many times more than that. Every one of those requests is a chance to stop an account takeover. But the real scale goes well beyond the API itself. Because the data model is open source and freely available, many organisations use the Pwned Passwords Downloader to take the entire corpus offline and query it directly within their own applications. That tool alone calls the API around a million times during download, but the resulting data is then queried… well, who knows how many times after that. Pretty cool, right?\n\nThis latest corpus of data came to us as a result of the FBI seizing multiple devices belonging to a suspect. The data appeared to have originated from both the open web and Tor-based marketplaces, Telegram channels and infostealer malware families. We hadn't seen about 7.4% of them in HIBP before, which might sound small, but that's 46 million vulnerable passwords we weren't giving people using the service the opportunity to block. So, we've added those and bumped the prevalence count on the other 584 million we already had.\n\nWe're thrilled to be able to provide this service to the community for free and want to also quickly thank Cloudflare for their support in providing us with the infrastructure to make this possible. Thanks to their edge caching tech, all those passwords are queryable from a location just a handful of milliseconds away from wherever you are on the globe.\n\nIf you're hitting the API, then all the data is already searchable for you. If you're downloading it all offline, go and grab the latest data now. Either way, go forth and put it to good use and help make a cybercriminal's day just that much harder 😊",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department violated the constitutional rights of a close friend of James Comey and must return to him computer files that prosecutors had hoped to use for a potential criminal case against the former FBI director, a federal judge said Friday.\n\nThe ruling from U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly represents not only a stern rebuke of the conduct of Justice Department prosecutors but also imposes a dramatic hurdle to government efforts to seek a new indictment against Comey after an initial one was dismissed last month.\n\nThe order concerns computer files and communications that investigators obtained years earlier from Daniel Richman, a Comey friend and Columbia University law professor, as part of a media leak investigation that concluded without charges. The Justice Department continued to hold onto those files and conducted searches of them this fall, without a new warrant, as they prepared a case charging Comey with lying to Congress five years ago.\n\nRichman alleged that the Justice Department violated his Fourth Amendment rights by retaining his records and by conducting new warrantless searches of the files, prompting Kollar-Kotelly to issue an order last week temporarily barring prosecutors from accessing the files as part of its investigation.\n\nThe Justice Department said the request for the return of the records was merely an attempt to impede a new prosecution of Comey, but the judge again sided with Richman in a 46-page order Friday that directed the Justice Department to give him back his files.\n\n“When the Government violates the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures by sweeping up a broad swath of a person’s electronic files, retaining those files long after the relevant investigation has ended, and later sifting through those files without a warrant to obtain evidence against someone else, what remedy is available to the victim of the Government’s unlawful intrusion?” the judge wrote.\n\nOne answer, she said, is to require the government to return the property to the rightful owner.\n\nThe judge did, however, permit the Justice Department to file an electronic copy of Richman's records under seal with the Eastern District of Virginia, where the Comey investigation has been based, and suggested prosecutors could try to access it later with a lawful search warrant.\n\nThe Justice Department alleges that Comey used Richman to share information with the news media about his decision-making during the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. Prosecutors charged the former FBI director in September with lying to Congress by denying that he had authorized an associate to serve as an anonymous source for the media.\n\nThat indictment was dismissed last month after a federal judge in Virginia ruled that the prosecutor who brought the case, Lindsey Halligan, was unlawfully appointed by the Trump administration. But the ruling left open the possibility that the government could try again to seek charges against Comey, a longtime foe of President Donald Trump. Comey has pleaded not guilty, denied having made a false statement and accused the Justice Department of a vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Comey saga has a long history.\n\nIn June 2017, one month after Comey was fired as FBI director, he testified that he had given Richman a copy of a memo he had written documenting a conversation he had with Trump and had authorized him to share the contents of the memo with a reporter.\n\nAfter that testimony, Richman permitted the FBI to create an image, or complete electronic copy, of all files on his computer and a hard drive attached to that computer. He authorized the FBI to conduct a search for limited purposes, the judge noted.\n\nThen, in 2019 and 2020, the FBI and Justice Department obtained search warrants to obtain Richman's email accounts and computer files as part of a media leak investigation that concluded in 2021 without charges. Those warrants were limited in scope, but Richman has alleged that the government collected more information than the warrants allowed, including personal medial information and sensitive correspondence.\n\nIn addition, Richman said the Justice Department violated his rights by searching his files in September, without a new warrant, as part of an entirely separate investigation.\n\n“The Court further concludes that the Government’s retention of Petitioner Richman’s files amounts to an ongoing unreasonable seizure,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote. “Therefore, the Court agrees with Petitioner Richman that the Government has violated his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures.”",
