    "title": "The Supreme Court is about to weigh in on the Fed's independence in a case that goes beyond Jerome Powell",
    "description": "The Fed's independence is being tested. Here's what SCOTUS justices could say on Wednesday about Trump's efforts to fire Fed board member Lisa Cook.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday is scheduled to hear arguments over President Donald Trump's attempts to fire a sitting Federal Reserve board member.\n\nLisa Cook, whom Trump tried to remove in August, has asked the high court to ensure she can keep her job. She's argued that the \"cause\" Trump cited, which involves allegations of mortgage irregularities, is a pretext. The efforts to fire her are based on politics, not economic data or job performance, her lawyers say.\n\nThe case has broad implications for the central bank's independence at a critical moment. Last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell accused Trump's Justice Department of an unprecedented attempt to pressure him with what he described as a sham criminal probe.\n\nAs Powell continues to battle what he has described as improper political interference, the Cook case tests a separate but related legal question: Can the president of the United States unseat a sitting Fed governor for any reason?\n\nJosh Chafetz, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown Law School, predicted the criminal investigation into Powell could make the Supreme Court justices more inclined to \"put the brakes\" on Trump's efforts to pressure the Fed.\n\n\"John Roberts doesn't want to throw the global economy into turmoil,\" Chafetz said, referring to the chief justice.\n\nOver the past year, the Supreme Court has greenlit Trump's firing of other independent agency leaders. At the same time, the majority of justices have said they would treat the Federal Reserve with special deference.\n\nIn Wednesday's oral arguments, we'll learn more about just how special the Fed really is.\n\nThe Federal Reserve — like the Federal Trade Commission and National Labor Relations Board — was created by Congress as an independent agency, structured to insulate its members from political winds. Presidents appoint board members for staggered 14-year terms. Cook, a Biden appointee, has until 2038 before her term expires.\n\nOver the years, the Supreme Court has chipped away at the independence of similarly constructed agencies.\n\nIn 2020, it ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent agency with a single director, could have its leader fired by the president \"at will\" — meaning for any reason whatsoever — rather than \"for cause.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court has suggested it may soon allow \"at will\" firings of leaders of independent agencies led by multi-member boards, too. In December, it heard oral arguments for a lawsuit brought by Rebecca Slaughter, who Trump fired from the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nTrump's letter firing Slaughter didn't identify any cause, even though the Supreme Court has previously said presidents need to meet that standard to remove FTC commissioners. And unlike Cook, the Supreme Court has allowed Slaughter to be removed from her post while additional legal proceedings play out.\n\nThe Supreme Court hasn't yet issued a final ruling in Slaughter's case. But during oral arguments in December, several Republican-appointed justices indicated they could deal a death blow to a 90-year-old case that recognized limits to the president's ability to fire members of independent agencies. The landmark unanimous ruling said agencies like the FTC were \"quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative,\" a structure intended to safeguard them from \"political domination.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts referred to the 1935 opinion, known as Humphrey's Executor, as \"a dried husk.\" Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett both asked Slaughter's lawyer if he could cite different Supreme Court precedents that would allow her to keep her job.\n\nDuring the past year's legal battles between the Trump administration and independent agency leaders, the justices have gone out of their way to single out the independence of the Federal Reserve.\n\nIn May, a majority of justices allowed Trump to remove members from two independent agencies — the Merit Systems Protection Board and National Labor Relations Board — but said the Federal Reserve's \"for cause removal protections\" would need to be considered with its \"distinct historical tradition\" in mind.\n\n\"The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,\" the justices wrote in an unsigned opinion.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh took pains during oral arguments in the Slaughter case to indicate that he was inclined to give the Federal Reserve special treatment.\n\nWhile questioning Solicitor General John Sauer, Kavanaugh asked about drawing \"a principled, sensible line\" that would distinguish the Federal Reserve from other agencies.\n\n\"The other side says that your position would undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve and they have concerns about that, and I share those concerns,\" Kavanaugh told Sauer.\n\nAlthough most Americans don't interact with the Fed directly, its policies affect their everyday lives. By controlling the direction of interest rates, the central bank determines the cost of borrowing and returns on savings. The Fed and its independence are the cornerstones of the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency.\n\nTo hear Cook's lawyers and prominent economists tell it, the potential damage is extraordinarily high. If Trump can fire her, then the door is open for future presidents to steamroll the Fed and cause economic chaos, they say.\n\n\"We can think about the Cook removal as seeking a roadmap from the court for how to potentially remove other governors, including Jerome Powell,\" said Lev Menand, a professor of administrative law and financial institutions at Columbia Law School.\n\nIn his attempt to fire Cook, Trump cited a criminal referral from Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who said Cook lied on mortgage forms.\n\nThat apparent deceitfulness, according to Trump, made Cook ill-suited for her role in setting interest rates.\n\nThere is no public indication that, in the months since Pulte's letter, the Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into Cook's mortgage paperwork.\n\nThe Trump administration has maintained that the president can fire a Federal Reserve board member for any reason and that courts don't have the power to second-guess any \"for cause\" justifications.\n\nCook's attorneys argue that such freedom defeats the entire purpose of \"for cause\" limitations, turning Fed board members into \"at will\" government employees. They also say that \"for cause\" justifications can only involve conduct during Cook's service — not years-old mortgage paperwork.\n\n​​With the Powell investigation \"hovering\" over the Cook case, the justices may be more wary of giving Trump the flexibility he wants to get rid of Cook, Chafetz said.\n\n\"If the president gets to define anything as 'cause,' and that's completely unreviewable, then that is serving at the pleasure of the president,\" Chafetz said.",

    "title": "The Supreme Court Just Decided a Major Issue in Cases Like Renee Good’s Shooting—and Not How You Might Expect",
    "description": "Last week, Jonathan Ross fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, a white mother of three, while she was in her SUV.",
    "fullText": "After federal agents killed an unarmed American citizen in broad daylight last week, high-ranking government officials rushed to defend the shooter, framed a mother’s attempt to escape an escalating confrontation as “domestic terrorism,” and blamed the victim for her own death. The killing of Renee Good is not just a failure of policing—the public response by those in power should alarm every American who believes that being frightened by armed agents and trying to drive away should not be a capital offense. Indeed, recent Supreme Court precedent illuminates why the shooting of Good by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross is not the case of self-defense that administration officials are suggesting. The totality of events—which has been the standard established by the court since 1989 and was reaffirmed just last year—suggests that it was not reasonable for Ross to shoot Good in the head as she was attempting to drive away from ICE agents trying to forcibly remove her from her car.\n\nLast week, Ross fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, a white mother of three, while she was in her SUV, apparently attempting to leave a situation that was becoming increasingly hostile. In cellphone video of the incident, we can see two ICE agents exit a pickup truck and approach Good’s car. As one agent appears to reach through the driver’s open window and tries to open the door, Good slowly reverses, then turns towards the right and drives forward slowly, attempting to leave. At that moment, a third officer, who is standing in front of Good’s car, unholsters his gun and, while moving to the side of the vehicle, fires several shots inside, striking Good in the head. The car continues to move forward and crashes into a parked car. Good was pronounced dead shortly after.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the agent who shot Good, saying, “This was an act of domestic terrorism. ICE officers got stuck in the snow and were attempting to push out their vehicle when a woman attacked them.” President Donald Trump also weighed in immediately after the killing, writing on Truth Social, “The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense.” None of the videos that have emerged from the shooting show Good running over the agent or attacking agents prior to her death.\n\nGood was a U.S. citizen, and DHS has stated she was not a target of an ICE investigation. She was shot just blocks from her home.\n\nAnother video of the incident follows what happened before the agents approached Good’s SUV. In the video, Good extends her arm from the open driver’s window and makes the “Go ahead” signal to a pickup truck that has just pulled up and stopped a few feet from her car, right before ICE agents exited the vehicle. The footage suggests that Good was not attempting to block agents with her car, as some have claimed.\n\nA third video, taken from the cellphone of the agent who shot Good, features a smiling Good, with her car window rolled down, saying, “That’s fine, dude. I’m not mad at you.” It also shows a woman, later identified as Becca Good, Good’s wife, outside the car, filming the ICE agent. As the agent is filming the license plate of their car, Becca says, “That’s OK, we don’t change our plates every morning, just so you know. It’ll be the same plate when you come talk to us later.” A few seconds later, two agents approach the SUV, one trying to open the driver’s-side door, while yelling, “Get out of the fucking car!” Possibly frightened at what appears to be a hostile situation, Good puts the car in reverse, then drives forward. The camera suddenly points towards the sky, and we hear a thud. Three shots ring out, one immediately after the other. After that, we hear a male voice saying, “Fucking bitch.”\n\nThe government has claimed that the agent who shot Good was in fear for his life and was acting in self-defense. The videos illustrate something else: an avoidable tragedy. Again, recent Supreme Court precedent helps explain why.\n\nIn assessing whether a law enforcement agent’s use of deadly force was reasonable or excessive, the court this past summer rejected the 5th Circuit’s narrow “moment of threat” doctrine—which stated that the only thing that matters in determining whether an officer reasonably fears for their life in a use-of-force situation is the moment of the shooting itself—as inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment. The court, in Barnes v. Felix, rejected this narrow time-framing approach and repeated what it had held in Graham v. Connor: In assessing the reasonableness of an officer’s use of force, one must consider the totality of circumstances.\n\nMany of those defending the shooting appear to be focusing on the moment just before he fired the first shot. Applying a moment-of-threat approach to this shooting would require one to freeze-frame the video at the moment the officer was standing in front of Good’s car and saw it inching forward. Under such a cramped view of the incident, one might conclude that in that moment, the officer feared for his life and therefore needed to shoot to defend himself.\n\nIn contrast, if we broaden the time frame and consider that the agent put himself in front of the vehicle, that a smiling Good had, seconds earlier, told the agent, “That’s fine, dude, I’m not mad at you” and started to move her car forward only after other agents approached her vehicle, with one reaching in through the open window, trying to open the driver’s side door, and screaming for her to get out of the “fucking car,” the claim that the agent needed to shoot Good to save his life seems less plausible. That the agent was able to stay on his two feet, move to the side of the car, and fire two shots into the open driver’s-side window as Good was turning the SUV to the right and trying to drive away further undermines the claim that he acted in self-defense to neutralize an imminent threat to his life. The videos suggest that Good was simply trying to leave what was becoming an increasingly hostile situation, not purposely trying to hit the ICE agent who had dangerously put himself in front of her car.\n\nOne question the court left open in Barnes was whether it is appropriate to consider prior conduct of law enforcement that increases the risk of an encounter with a civilian turning deadly—something many have called “officer-created jeopardy.” It seems obvious that if one is applying a totality-of-the-circumstances approach, then prior conduct of law enforcement that increases the risk that the encounter will turn deadly is just part of the totality of the circumstances and ought to be part of the inquiry.\n\nSome have pointed out that putting oneself in front of a moving vehicle is not considered a wise police practice. Similarly, shooting into a moving vehicle is not considered a good police practice unless necessary to stop an armed or dangerous felon (neither of which accurately describes Good), because of the risk of injury to the occupant of the vehicle and nearby bystanders. Although the first shot appears to have gone through the car’s front windshield, the second and third shots seem to have been fired by the agent at Good’s head through the open driver’s-side window as she was trying to leave. The officer by that time was firing from the side of the vehicle, not shooting someone trying to run him over as has been claimed. If he simply wanted to stop the vehicle from escaping, why did he aim at the driver’s head rather than the tires of the SUV?\n\nIn discussing the shooting, Noem said, “Any loss of life is a tragedy, and I think all of us can agree that, in this situation, it was preventable,” suggesting it was Good’s own fault that she had been shot. Similarly, Vice President J.D. Vance has said that Good’s death was “a tragedy of her own making.” With these comments, Noem, Vance, and others defending the officer posit that if Good had simply followed orders and gotten out of the car, none of this would have happened.\n\nIronically, Good’s death was completely preventable, not because Good failed to comply with the order to exit her car but because the officer could have exercised restraint and refrained from shooting her. He had taken a video of her license plate number, so if the agency wanted to track her down, it could have done so later. When the agent fired two shots into the open driver’s-side window from the side of Good’s car, Good was not posing an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to him or any other agent. Good was not a violent felon trying to flee the scene of a crime. She was just trying to get home to her three kids in one piece.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court sided with Montana police on Wednesday in a case over when officers can enter a home without a warrant if an emergency might be unfolding inside.\n\nThe unanimous high court found officers acted lawfully when they went into the home of William Case, who was shot and wounded after officers entered his home in 2021.\n\nPolice were responding to a call from Case's former girlfriend, who feared he might have killed himself. They entered his home after knocking on the door produced no response. An officer fired after Case threw open a closet curtain while holding an object that looked like a gun, according to court documents. A handgun was later found in a nearby laundry basket.\n\nCase was charged with assaulting an officer but argued that the evidence against him should be tossed out because officers didn’t have a warrant.\n\nThe Montana Supreme Court disagreed, finding that the officers needed only to reasonably suspect someone required emergency help. Case appealed to the justices and asked them to require a higher probable cause standard, similar to criminal investigations.\n\nThe justices rejected that argument. They found that the standard set by the state's highest court was too low but that the Montana officers' actions were nevertheless “objectively reasonable” under a standard set in a previous Supreme Court case.\n\nThe opinion written by Justice Elena Kagan noted that entering during an emergency doesn't allow police to search beyond what's needed to help and keep officers safe.\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court.",

    "fullText": "Judges rarely complain openly about the Supreme Court, for the same reason that most people do not publicly chastise their bosses. Attacking your boss is a good way to ensure that your own work will be discounted — or worse.\n\nSo it’s remarkable just how many judges have published opinions criticizing the Supreme Court’s decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n v. Bruen (2022), a decision by all six of the Court’s Republicans that instructs lower court judges on how they should handle Second Amendment cases.\n\nOr, at least, Bruen purports to provide lower courts with this kind of guidance. As one federal judge complained in a 2023 opinion, the “unique test” the Republican justices came up with in Bruen “does not provide lower courts with clear guidance.” Courts, a different federal appellate judge wrote, “are struggling at every stage of the Bruen inquiry.”\n\nIndeed, in her concurring opinion in United States v. Rahimi (2024), the Supreme Court’s only attempt to interpret Bruen since that decision was handed down, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson quoted a dozen different judicial opinions complaining that Bruen simply does not work. One Trump appointee protested Bruen’s “inconsistent and amorphous standard” and warned that it “created mountains of work for district courts that must now deal with Bruen-related arguments in nearly every criminal case in which a firearm is found”\n\nBriefly, Bruen held that for nearly any gun law to survive a constitutional challenge, “the government must demonstrate that the regulation is consistent with this Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.” To meet this burden, government lawyers must show that the modern-day gun law they are defending is sufficiently similar to “analogous regulations” that existed when the Constitution was framed.\n\nAnd just how “analogous” must these long-forgotten laws be? As the dozen judges quoted by Justice Jackson show, no one really knows. In 2020, the federal government alone charged more than 14,000 defendants with firearm-related crimes. Thanks to Bruen, every single one of those cases can descend into a Mad Hatter–like inquiry into how a raven resembles a writing desk.\n\nWhich brings us to Wolford v. Lopez, the first of two Second Amendment cases that the Court plans to hear in its current term. Wolford, which the justices will hear on January 20, is poised to be the Court’s second-ever decision explaining what the hell Bruen means.\n\nA humbler Court would recognize that Bruen is a failure and overrule that decision — prior to Bruen, every federal appeals court used a two-step framework (which I explain in more detail here) to analyze Second Amendment cases. The Court could simply restore this framework, which worked perfectly well and did not create the same confusion among judges.\n\nBut that outcome is unlikely. Historical analysis is currently fashionable among Republican judges, many of whom identify with originalism — an approach to constitutional cases which fixates on how words were understood more than 200 years ago. In Bruen, the Republican justices attempted to build a framework for interpreting an entire constitutional amendment that is grounded in originalism. Overruling Bruen means admitting that this originalist project failed.\n\nStill, the Wolford case should give pro-gun Republicans pause for an unexpected reason: The biggest advantage the lawyers defending a Hawaii gun law have on their side is the Court’s cockamamie reasoning in Bruen.\n\nThe plaintiffs in Wolford, three gun owners and a pro-gun advocacy group, challenge a fairly clever Hawaii law that appears to be designed to undermine the result the Court reached in Bruen.\n\nBruen struck down a 108-year-old New York state law that required anyone who wanted to carry a handgun in public to demonstrate “proper cause” before they could obtain a license allowing them to do so. The Hawaii law at issue in Wolford imposes similarly strict restrictions on public carry through a different means. It makes it a crime to bring a gun onto private property “unless the person has been given express authorization to carry a firearm on the property by the owner, lessee, operator, or manager of the property.”\n\nThus, the practical effect of Hawaii’s law is to remove guns from most shops, hotels, restaurants, and other places of business. Most business owners aren’t going to put out a sign announcing that guns are allowed inside. And few gun owners are likely to enter such a business without their firearm, track down the manager, obtain permission to bring their gun inside, and then go retrieve the weapon.\n\nIf Bruen were a coherent decision that applied normal legal reasoning, in other words, the Wolford plaintiffs would have a fairly clear cut case. Typically, the Supreme Court does not allow states to bypass its decisions by concocting Rube Goldberg–like devices to achieve ends that the Court has already determined are unconstitutional.\n\nAnd yet, somewhat ironically, the best thing that Hawaii’s lawyers have going for them in Wolford is the nonsensical historical framework laid out in Bruen.\n\nIn their brief to the justices, Hawaii’s lawyers identify various colonial and early American state laws that closely resemble the Hawaii statute forbidding gun owners to bring their weapons onto private land without the landowner’s permission.\n\nThis list includes a 1771 New Jersey law barring someone from bringing “any gun on any Lands not his own, and for which the owner pays taxes, or is in his lawful possession, unless he has license or permission in writing from the owner.” It also includes a similar 1721 Pennsylvania law preventing someone from hunting or bringing a gun onto another person’s land without “Lisence [sic] or Permission from the Owner of any such Lands or Plantation,” and a 1763 New York law making it unlawful to carry a gun on “inclosed Land” without “License in Writing first had and obtained for that Purpose from such Owner, Proprietor, or Possessor.”\n\nIt appears, in other words, that Americans around the time of the nation’s founding and the ratification of the Second Amendment were quite comfortable with laws banning gun possession on private land without the land owner’s permission. That should be enough to uphold Hawaii’s law under Bruen’s “historical tradition of firearm regulation” standard. But it’s not that simple.\n\nWolford should be an awkward case for the Court’s Republicans, because the largely pro-gun framework they announced in Bruen doesn’t actually point to a pro-gun result in this case. Realistically, however, the Bruen framework is sufficiently malleable that these justices can reach whatever result they want in Wolford.\n\nConsider, for example, Rahimi, the only post-Bruen case the Court has handed down interpreting that decision.\n\nRahimi involved a cartoonishly violent individual who, when the Court decided this case, was accused of committing six different shooting crimes — that is, crimes where he actually discharged a firearm. In one of these incidents, he allegedly fired his gun at a bystander who witnessed him beating the mother of his child. A majority of the justices voted to uphold his conviction under a federal law that prohibits many people who are subject to domestic violence restraining orders from possessing a gun.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the majority opinion in Rahimi, primarily reasoned that this federal law was sufficiently similar to Founding Era laws that required individuals who were believed to be likely to engage in violence to post a bond, which they would forfeit if they “broke the peace.”\n\nIn dissent, meanwhile, Justice Clarence Thomas argued that these bond-posting laws were not sufficiently similar to the modern-day ban on carrying a gun while under a restraining order, because the Founding Era laws “imposed a far less onerous burden.” They neither disarmed individuals nor incarcerated them if they were later found with a gun.\n\nBecause Bruen’s “analogous regulations” test is so vague, both Roberts and Thomas made plausible arguments: Bruen didn’t fully explain just how similar a modern law must be to a colonial or early American law in order to survive judicial review. Indeed, if anything, Thomas had the stronger argument that the law in Rahimi should have been struck down under Bruen.\n\nBruen said that “when a challenged regulation addresses a general societal problem that has persisted since the 18th century, the lack of a distinctly similar historical regulation addressing that problem is relevant evidence that the challenged regulation is inconsistent with the Second Amendment.” Violence between romantic partners is a societal problem that existed well before the 18th century. But every state permitted married partners to beat their spouses until 1871, when the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that a husband and wife “may be indicted for assault and battery upon each other.”\n\nBruen, in other words, does not actually tell judges how to decide gun cases — as so many lower court judges have complained. It merely insists that they must tell a story about whether a modern law is similar to a very old law.\n\nIndeed, there is empirical evidence that Bruen gives judges broad leeway to decide gun cases however they choose. A 2023 paper by scholars Eric Ruben, Rosanna Smart, and Ali Rowhani-Rahbar indicates that “Bruen has not meaningfully constrained judges” and has instead freed them to decide gun cases according to their “judicial ideology.” The paper finds that “judges appointed by Republican presidents are 1.8 times as likely” to rule that a gun law violates Bruen “as judges appointed by Democratic presidents.”\n\nBruen, in other words, is not law. Rather than constraining how judges decide cases, it merely requires them to cite historical sources in an opinion that reaches whatever conclusion aligns with their politics. On a 6-3 Republican Supreme Court, that means that the Hawaii law at issue in Wolford is likely to fall.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump issued a grave warning on Monday, warning that “WE’RE SCREWED” if the Supreme Court strikes down the tariffs he’s unilaterally imposed on much of the rest of the world.\n\n“The actual numbers that we would have to pay back if, for any reason, the Supreme Court were to rule against the United States of America on Tariffs, would be many Hundreds of Billions of Dollars, and that doesn’t include the amount of ‘payback’ that Countries and Companies would require for the Investments they are making on building Plants, Factories, and Equipment, for the purpose of being able to avoid the payment of Tariffs,” declared Trump in a post on Truth Social.\n\n“When these Investments are added, we are talking about Trillions of Dollars! It would be a complete mess, and almost impossible for our Country to pay. Anybody who says that it can be quickly and easily done would be making a false, inaccurate, or totally misunderstood answer to this very large and complex question. It may not be possible but, if it were, it would be Dollars that would be so large that it would take many years to figure out what number we are talking about and even, who, when, and where, to pay,” he continued. “Remember, when America shines brightly, the World shines brightly. In other words, if the Supreme Court rules against the United States of America on this National Security bonanza, WE’RE SCREWED!”\n\nThe Court’s ruling on the matter is expected to be released in the near future, and possibly even this Wednesday.\n\nAfter the Department of Commerce released figures last month indicating that the economy had grown at an impressive annualized rate of 4.3% between last July and September, Trump credited his trade policy.\n\n“The TARIFFS are responsible for the GREAT USA Economic Numbers JUST ANNOUNCED…AND THEY WILL ONLY GET BETTER!” he argued at the time. “Also, NO INFLATION & GREAT NATIONAL SECURITY. Pray for the U.S. Supreme Court!!!”\n\nThe Court heard the case, which challenges Trump’s authority to levy the import taxes without congressional action, in November. During oral arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts characterized the tariffs as “taxes on Americans” in a moment that some court-watchers believed portended poorly for the administration.\n\nThe post ‘WE’RE SCREWED’: Trump Issues Grave Warning About Supreme Court Striking Down Tariff ‘Bonanza’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "The Supreme Court on Monday declined to review a $2.4 billion bankruptcy settlement for the Boy Scouts of America, rejecting an appeal from a group of childhood sex-abuse victims who said the deal unlawfully blocked them from suing groups that ran local scouting programs.\n\nThe group of victims – 75 people out of more than 82,000 who filed claims against the Boy Scouts – argued that the justices should have reopened the settlement in light of its decision last year in a similar legal dispute in involving Purdue Pharma, the maker of the opioid pain mediciation OxyContin. In that case, a 5-4 majority rejected a bankruptcy agreement that would have shielded the Sackler family from future lawsuits even though it made its fortune running the company.\n\nIn the Boy Scouts case, some of the victims want to be able to sue independent councils that ran local scouting programs and third-party organizations, such as churches and civic groups, that supported the programs. Those third-party groups contributed billions of dollars to a settlement trust for victims and, under the agreement, are shielded from future civil lawsuits.\n\nCritics of such arrangements say courts are generally not authorized to block such lawsuits. Supporters say that without protections for third-party groups, major bankruptcy deals like the ones for Purdue and the Boy Scouts would never take effect.\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America filed for bankruptcy in 2020 after spending more than $150 million to settle hundreds of abuse lawsuits between 2017 and 2019, according to court records. In 2022, a federal bankruptcy court in Delaware approved the reorganization plan, clearing the way for the Boy Scouts of America to reemerge and creating a fund to pay victims.\n\nLower courts, including the 3rd US Circuit Court Appeals, upheld the settlement agreement. The Lujan claimants appealed to the Supreme Court in October. The Supreme Court in early 2024 rejected an emergency appeal from the same group of victims.\n\nThough the Supreme Court did not explain its reasoning, the decision leaves in a place an appeals court decision that found that the way the Boy Scouts deal was structured largely shielded it from review by appellate courts.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to issue its next rulings on January 14 as several major cases remain pending including the legality ​of President Donald Trump's sweeping global tariffs.\n\nThe court indicated on its website on Friday that ‌it could release decisions in argued cases when the justices take the bench during a scheduled sitting next Wednesday. The court ‌does not announce in advance what cases will be decided.\n\nThe justices issued one ruling on Friday in a criminal case.\n\nThe challenge to Trump's tariffs marks a major test of presidential powers as well as of the court's willingness to check some of the Republican president's far-reaching assertions of authority since he returned to ⁠office in January 2025. The outcome ‌will also impact the global economy.\n\nDuring arguments in the case heard by the court on November 5, conservative and liberal justices appeared to cast doubt on the ‍legality of the tariffs, which Trump imposed by invoking a 1977 law meant for use during national emergencies. Trump's administration is appealing rulings by lower courts that he overstepped his authority.\n\nTrump has said tariffs have made the United ​States stronger financially. In a social media post on January 2, Trump said a Supreme Court ‌ruling against the tariffs would be a \"terrible blow\" to the United States.\n\nTrump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs on goods imported from individual countries - nearly every foreign trading partner - to address what he called a national emergency related to U.S. trade deficits. He invoked the same law to impose tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, citing the trafficking of the often-abused painkiller fentanyl ⁠and illicit drugs into the United States as a national ​emergency.\n\nThe challenges to the tariffs in the cases before the ​Supreme Court were brought by businesses affected by the tariffs and 12 U.S. states, most of them Democratic-governed.\n\nOther important cases are also awaiting rulings at the court, which ‍has a 6-3 conservative majority, ⁠including a challenge to a key section of the Voting Rights Act, the landmark 1965 federal law enacted by Congress to prevent racial discrimination in voting.\n\nAnother involves a challenge on free ⁠speech grounds to a Colorado law banning psychotherapists from conducting \"conversion therapy\" that aims to change an LGBT minor's sexual orientation ‌or gender identity.",

    "description": "Nearly four years after the lawsuit was first filed, a key threshold question is moving toward a final answer.",
    "fullText": "Nearly four years after the lawsuit was first filed, a key threshold question is moving toward a final answer.\n\nThe NFL has filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court as to the question of whether the civil action filed in February 2022 by former Dolphins coach (and current Vikings defensive coordinator) Brian Flores against the NFL, the Dolphins, the Giants, the Broncos, and the Texans will be resolved in court, or in arbitration.\n\nThe specific legal question presented to the Supreme Court is this: \"Whether an arbitration agreement governing disputes in a professional sports league is categorically unenforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act because it designates the league commissioner as the default arbitrator and permits the commissioner to develop arbitral procedures.\"\n\nThe NFL has wisely narrowed the question, given that the reasoning (if applied throughout corporate America) would empower other companies to attempt to rig the in-house arbitration process by putting employment disputes in the hands of the CEO. Still, the league's position is clear — it wants the Commissioner to retain power over disputes involving the NFL and the various teams that have hired and that handsomely compensate the Commissioner.\n\nThe 25-page document is the first step in an effort to persuade the Supreme Court to take up the case. Of the many petitions it receives each year, few are accepted.\n\nMore time will pass as the Supreme Court considers whether to take the case. Even more time will pass if the Supreme Court grants the petition.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit invalidated the NFL's arbitration provision, concluding that the procedure lacks independence. (And it does.) The Supreme Court, if it takes the case, will decide once and for all whether it's legitimate for the NFL (and any sports league) to put its Commissioner in charge of claims made against the NFL.\n\nIt's fundamentally unfair to delegate those powers to someone whose connection to one side of a legal fight is so obvious. Frankly, no Commissioner should want to be expected to set aside their clear self-interests in an effort to dispense justice in an objective way.\n\nBut this has been the league's practice, for years. It desperately wants to run its own business. It desperately hopes to hold the gavel when it comes to deciding whether the legal claims against it are valid.\n\nIt's a bad way to do business. It's now for the Supreme Court to decide whether it's a good way, or a bad way, to apply the laws of the United States.",

    "fullText": "A new study has bolstered a scathing dissent from liberal Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson that warned the court appeared to favor the rich.\n\nThe study, published Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research, investigated whether the Supreme Court has contributed to rising income inequality by ruling in favor of policies that favor wealthy parties.\n\nIts authors—two academics from Columbia University in New York and one from Yale University—found that in cases pitting the rich against the poor, Republican appointees were far more likely than their Democratic colleagues to side with the wealthier party.\n\nBack in 1953, Democratic and Republican appointees were statistically indistinguishable on the issue, with justices appointed by members of both parties favoring the rich in 45 percent of cases on average.\n\nThe average Democratic justice cast a “pro-rich” vote—which was defined as a vote that would directly shift resources to the party that was more likely to be wealthy, including votes that supported businesses over consumers or workers—just 35 percent of the time.\n\n“The results reveal a steady increase in polarization, mostly due to Republican appointees whose decisions rise from about 50 percent pro-rich share to a 70 percent pro-rich share over the course of 70 years,” the study’s authors, Andrea Prat, a Columbia economics professor, Jacob Spitz, a Columbia PhD student, Fiona Scott Morton, a Yale economics professor, and wrote.\n\nThe findings also supported a June dissent authored by Brown Jackson, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe justices held 7-2 that oil and gas companies had legal standing to challenge California’s environmental regulations requiring automakers to produce more electric vehicles and fewer gasoline-powered ones.\n\n“This case gives fodder to the unfortunate perception that moneyed interests enjoy an easier road to relief in this Court than ordinary citizens,” Brown Jackson wrote. “I worry that the fuel industry’s gain comes at a reputational cost for this Court, which is already viewed by many as being overly sympathetic to corporate interests.”\n\nThat perception could be contributing to an overall drop in public confidence in the court, according to the Times. The Daily Beast has reached out to the Supreme Court for comment.\n\nThe court’s favorability rating has plunged by 22 points over the past five years, from 70 percent in 2020 to a near-record low 48 percent late last year, the Pew Research Center reported in September.\n\nAnd although a vast majority of Americans, or 86 percent, think the justices should be non-partisan, 56 percent said the justices were doing only a fair or poor job of keeping their political views out of their legal decision-making.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump is fretting that the Supreme Court will shoot down his signature tariffs initiative and declare it illegal.\n\nIn a panicked Truth Social post, the 79-year-old pushed the false claim that his tariffs generated $600 billion for the U.S. while suggesting there is a media blackout on their dubious benefits.\n\n“We have taken in, and will soon be receiving, more than 600 Billion Dollars in Tariffs, but the Fake News Media refuses to talk about it because they hate and disrespect our Country, and want to interfere with the upcoming Tariff decision, one of the most important ever, of the United States Supreme Court,” Trump wrote. “Because of Tariffs, our Country is financially, AND FROM A NATIONAL SECURITY STANDPOINT, FAR STRONGER AND MORE RESPECTED THAN EVER BEFORE. GOD BLESS AMERICA!”\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to rule in the coming weeks on whether to overturn a previous ruling that declared most of Trump’s sweeping global tariffs illegal.\n\nA lower federal appeals court found in August that the president had overstepped his authority when he cited a 1977 law—the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which is designed to address threats during a national emergency—to justify his reciprocal tariffs.\n\nWhile the conservative-majority Supreme Court, including three justices nominated by Trump, has largely ruled in the president’s favor in past cases, there are growing indications that the court may not back him this time and could strike down the tariffs.\n\nDuring a hearing in November, Trump-appointed Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch, as well as Chief Justice John Roberts, appeared skeptical of the president’s reasoning for imposing the tariffs.\n\nIf SCOTUS were to rule against Trump, it would not only be a major embarrassment for the president but could also trigger further economic turmoil, as countries may need to be reimbursed for the billions of dollars of funds collected under Trump’s tariff plans.\n\nTrump has posted multiple fear-mongering messages on Truth Social since the Supreme Court began hearing arguments in the case last year.\n\n“The U.S. Supreme Court was given the wrong numbers. The ‘unwind’ in the event of a negative decision on Tariffs would be, including investments made, to be made, and return of funds, in excess of 3 Trillion Dollars,” Trump wrote in a late-night November post. “It would not be possible to ever make up for that kind of a ‘drubbing.’”\n\nIn another desperate message on January 2, Trump added: “Tariffs are an overwhelming benefit to our Nation, as they have been incredible for our National Security and Prosperity (like nobody has ever seen before!). Losing our ability to Tariff other countries who treat us unfairly would be a terrible blow to the United States of America.”",

    "description": "The owner of the house and her family have four cars, so they spill slightly onto the lawn when parked—which is where the town takes issue.",
    "fullText": "Parking in a driveway is about as mundane as parking can get. It's not as fancy as in a garage. It's not as potentially dangerous as parking on a street. And yet, in this story, it's led to a six-figure fine that the Florida Supreme Court has decided to let stand after several years of litigation.\n\nWhile the state's Supreme Court didn't endorse the fine, according to CBS News, it declined to review the case of Sandy Martinez, a single mother who has spent several years fighting fines that have now ballooned to $165,000 and counting. Over $100,000 of those fines relate directly to Ms. Martinez parking her cars on her driveway and slightly onto her grass. Her home isn't home to her alone; her son, daughter, and sister all live with her. All four of them have full-time jobs, and each of them has their own car. The house itself is on a corner lot, so street parking isn't available. As such, they line their cars up across the four-car driveway.\n\nUnfortunately, one of the four cars always ends up having to park slightly onto the grass in the yard that Martinez owns. According to the city of Lantana, that's unacceptable, and as a result it has fined her $250 a day for over a year.\n\nThe Institute for Justice has stepped in, and is representing Martinez. “Six-figure fines for parking on your own property are shocking,” IJ senior attorney Ari Bargil told CBS News, following the court’s decision not to take up the case. “The court’s refusal to hear Sandy’s case is a disservice to all Floridians.”\n\nFor Martinez, options moving forward are extremely limited. CBS News says Florida's Homestead Protection Act shields her from foreclosure, but it's destroyed the equity she'd built up in her home. She can't retry the case in Florida either, and given the Supreme Court's ruling, it's unlikely that a federal court would hear the case.\n\nYou Need a Torque Wrench in Your Toolbox\n\nTested: Best Car Interior Cleaners",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a March presidential memorandum to revoke the security clearance of prominent Washington attorney Mark Zaid, ruling that the order — which also targeted 14 other individuals — could not be applied to him.\n\nThe decision marked the administration’s second legal setback on Tuesday, after the Supreme Court declined to allow Trump to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area, capping a first year in office in which President Donald Trump’s efforts to impose a sweeping agenda and pursue retribution against political adversaries have been repeatedly slowed by the courts.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amir Ali in Washington granted Zaid's request for a preliminary injunction, after he sued the Trump administration in May over the revocation of his security clearance. Zaid's request called it an act of “improper political retribution” that jeopardized his ability to continue representing clients in sensitive national security cases.\n\nThe March presidential memorandum singled out Zaid and 14 other individuals who the White House asserted were unsuitable to retain their clearances because it was “no longer in the national interest.” The list included targets of Trump’s fury from both the political and legal spheres, including former Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, New York Attorney General Letitia James, former President Joe Biden and members of his family.\n\nThe action was part of a much broader retribution campaign that Trump has waged since returning to the White House, including directing specific Justice Department investigations against perceived adversaries and issuing sweeping executive orders targeting law firms over legal work he does not like.\n\nIn August, the Trump administration said it was revoking the security clearances of 37 current and former national security officials. Ordering the revocation of clearances has been a favored retributive tactic that Trump has wielded — or at least tried to — against high-profile political figures, lawyers and intelligence officials in his second term.\n\nZaid said in his lawsuit that he has represented clients across the political spectrum over nearly 35 years, including government officials, law enforcement and military officials and whistleblowers. In 2019, he represented an intelligence community whistleblower whose account of a conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy helped set the stage for the first of two impeachment cases against Trump in his first term.\n\n\"This court joins the several others in this district that have enjoined the government from using the summary revocation of security clearances to penalize lawyers for representing people adverse to it,\" Ali wrote in his order.\n\nAli emphasized that his order does not prevent the government from revoking or suspending Zaid’s clearance for reasons independent of the presidential memorandum and through normal agency processes. The preliminary injunction does not go into effect until January 13.\n\nZaid said in a statement, “This is not just a victory for me, it’s an indictment of the Trump administration’s attempts to intimidate and silence the legal community, especially lawyers who represent people who dare to question or hold this government accountable.\"",

    "description": "The 6th Circuit, relying on the Supreme Court’s Loper Bright decision, ruled that the FCC's 2024 Open Internet Order reclassifying broadband as a tele",
    "fullText": "Update as of January 2, 2025: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit issued a decision on the consolidated petitions for review of the FCC's 2024 Open Internet Order. In its January 2 decision, which relies heavily on principles articulated in Loper Bright, the court held that the FCC's 2024 Open Internet Order reclassifying broadband as a telecommunications service misinterpreted the text of the Communications Act, and therefore the FCC's reclassification exceeded its statutory authority.\n\nInstead, the court held that in offering consumers the capability of retrieving information via telecommunications, ISPs offer an information service and that mobile broadband is not interconnected with the PTSN and is therefore a private mobile service not subject to common carrier regulation. Moreover, given its ruling, the court did not address whether the major questions doctrine also barred the FCC's reclassification. Finally, because the Open Internet Order was already stayed by the 6th Circuit last August, there is no immediate impact and, with the pending change in administration and FCC leadership in less than three weeks, it is unlikely the government will seek any further review through panel or en banc rehearing or certiorari to the Supreme Court, although certain of the intervenors supporting reclassification could.\n\nRead our latest advisory for more about the decision and key takeaways. The original advisory from June 6, 2024, appears below.\n\nOn May 7, 2024, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued its latest network neutrality order, Safeguarding and Securing the Open Internet (the \"Order\"), which was published in the Federal Register on May 22, 2024, making it mostly effective July 22, 2024. This massive document (more than 500 single-spaced pages in all) reinstates, with a few significant modifications, the network neutrality rules that the agency had previously imposed in 2015 (in the Open Internet Order), but which were set aside in 2017 (in the Restoring Internet Freedom, or RIF Order, and the Order on Remand, when the agency shifted from Democratic to Republican control following the 2016 election). Parties have asked the FCC to stay the Order and filed Petitions for Review challenging the Order in court.\n\nThe Order takes the following key steps (discussed in more detail below):\n\nIn broad strokes, the FCC's decisions in the Order – from the legal logic of the classification of BIAS as a telecommunications service, to the content of the new rules, to the exceptions from generally applicable telecommunications regulations – are the same as in the agency's 2015 Open Internet Order. We discuss the most important of those re-created rulings below. In addition, there are some interesting and potentially significant differences between this order and the 2015 Open Internet Order, which we also discuss below.\n\nAs noted above, the Order is extremely lengthy and detailed. We strongly recommend that BIAS providers and other interested parties carefully review the Order and consult with counsel about how the rulings in the Order may affect their decisions and operations going forward. With that caveat, however, set out below is a more in-depth discussion of the Order's key holdings.\n\nThe FCC first adopted a transparency rule in 2010, requiring BIAS providers to disclose accurate information about network management practices, network performance, and commercial terms (pricing, etc.). The FCC reaffirmed that rule in the 2015 Open Internet Order. In the 2017 RIF Order, the FCC modified the rule somewhat. The Order reinstates the 2015 rule.\n\nThe transparency rule requires BIAS providers to disclose information \"sufficient for consumers to make informed choices regarding use of such services.\" The 2017 version, from the RIF Order, states that the information must be sufficient for \"entrepreneurs and other small businesses to develop, market, and maintain internet offerings.\" The rule in the Order specifies that disclosures must be sufficient for \"content, application, service, and device providers to develop, market, and maintain Internet offerings.\"\n\nThe 2017 RIF Order eliminated the requirement that BIAS providers disclose information about packet loss on their networks, but the Order reinstates that obligation.\n\nThe 2017 RIF Order permitted providers to disclose network performance (such as actually achieved data rates) on a reasonably aggregated basis. The Order requires that reported performance must be geographically disaggregated so that a consumer in a given area can learn what to reasonably expect from a BIAS offering. Moreover, the Order requires disclosure of performance over a reasonable period of time and during times of peak usage so that consumers will know how the provider's network performs under conditions of maximum congestion. The Order does not, however, require disclosure of the source, location, timing, or duration of network congestion.\n\nThe obligations to report packet loss and geographically granular performance will not apply to BIAS providers with 100,000 or fewer customers.\n\nThe Order also requires that BIAS providers make their disclosures on the BIAS provider's website and not simply report them to the Commission (which was an option under the 2017 RIF Order). Moreover, the disclosures must be in machine-readable format, such as a .csv file, to facilitate consumers comparing the reported performance of different BIAS providers.\n\nFinally, the Order reinstates the requirement from the 2015 Open Internet Order that BIAS providers give consumers direct notice that their usage is about to trigger a change in performance level (e.g., a rate limitation after the consumer has used up their data allowance). As with packet loss and granular geographic reporting, this requirement does not apply to BIAS providers with 100,000 or fewer customers.\n\nThe 2017 RIF Order did not forbid blocking or throttling and so did not need to impose a carve-out for \"reasonable network management.\" The Order reinstates the no-blocking and no-throttling rules and so also reinstates the carve-out from those rules for \"reasonable network management.\" This exception will only apply to practices that have a \"primarily technical network management justification,\" rather than a justification based on \"other business practices.\" The no-blocking rule also prohibits BIAS providers from charging edge providers a fee to avoid having edge providers' content, services, or applications blocked from reaching BIAS providers' end-user customers.\n\nIf a technical justification exists, the FCC will assess whether a network management practice is reasonable based on the specific technology of a BIAS provider's network. Landline, mobile, and satellite BIAS providers will be able to adopt practices that make sense considering the constraints of their individual network technologies. The FCC specifically states that providers may implement practices needed for network security and that block traffic unwanted by end users (such as spam or malware) and does not prevent or restrict a BIAS provider from refusing to transmit unlawful material, such as child sexual abuse material or copyright-infringing materials. The FCC will consider (that is, view more leniently) practices for managing congestion that only apply during times of actual congestion. Congestion management practices should be \"as application-agnostic as possible.\"\n\nThe 2017 RIF Order purported to broadly preempt state-level regulation of broadband. However, the D.C. Circuit ruled that the FCC could not preempt state regulation when the theory of the RIF Order was that the FCC lacked regulatory authority over broadband in the first place.\n\nThe Order takes a different approach, stating that it will preempt \"any state or local measures that interfere or are incompatible with the federal regulatory framework we establish today.\" However, the FCC will undertake preemption on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, the FCC notes that different states may legitimately impose different requirements regarding (for example) \"customer relationships and billing practices.\" In this regard, the FCC expressly declined to preempt California's \"Internet Consumer Protection and Network Neutrality Act of 2018\" on the ground that the law tracked the rules and requirements of the 2015 Open Internet Order that were set aside by the 2017 RIF Order and thus largely \"mirror or parallel\" the new Order's rules.\n\nThe Order's case-by-case approach to preemption could be problematic in that it may encourage states to impose potentially onerous regulations on BIAS providers under the rubric of consumer protection, in the hope that the regulations will either not be challenged or will survive a preemption attack at the FCC. It remains to be seen how this concern will play out in practice.\n\nEven while imposing net neutrality rules on BIAS providers – which, at a high level, boil down to fulfilling the basic common carrier obligations of nondiscrimination and reasonable conduct – the FCC did not want to impose most of the other, detailed obligations the Communications Act and the agency's own rules impose on telecommunications carriers. So, just as it did in the 2015 Open Internet Order, in the Order the FCC used its authority under Section 10 of the Act to \"forbear\" from applying a wide swath of those obligations.\n\nHere are the key regulatory obligations to which BIAS providers will not be subject under the Order (at least for now):\n\nWhile the FCC exempted BIAS providers from the provisions noted above, it determined that it would not forbear from applying certain other obligations of telecommunications carriers. The key obligations that will apply to BIAS providers are:\n\nIn addition to the specific statutory privacy obligations established by Section 222 of the Act governing the confidentiality of voice service-related \"customer proprietary network information\" (\"CPNI\"), the FCC has interpreted Section 222(a) and the general \"reasonableness\" requirement of Section 201(b) as establishing a general requirement for carriers to protect the confidentiality of customer information that does not fall under the definition of CPNI. Relying on these two statutory provisions, the agency recently promulgated detailed and potentially onerous data security and data breach reporting obligations on all traditional telecommunications carriers. The Order waives those specific rules, at least for now, for BIAS providers. In the meantime, providers have challenged the data security and data breach rules in the Sixth Circuit, arguing that Section 222 does not provide the FCC with authority to regulate customer privacy other than with respect to CPNI.\n\nOne reason for exempting BIAS providers from the new rules is that the agency did not have BIAS providers in mind when it formulated those rules. Beyond that, however, the agency seems to be pursuing some other goals as well.\n\nFirst, as noted above, for some time the agency has contended that Section 222(a) imposes a general obligation to protect customer information, separate and apart from the specific obligation on carriers to protect CPNI. The Order reasserts that view, which many industry participants dispute.\n\nSecond, the agency also contends that it has authority to impose privacy and data security obligations under the general \"just and reasonable\" standard in Section 201, which, again, many industry participants dispute.\n\nThird, in the wake of the 2015 Open Internet Order, in 2016 the agency separately issued an order (the \"2016 Privacy Order\") along with a set of detailed and onerous privacy rules specifically applicable to BIAS providers, relying on Sections 222(a) and 201(b) as authority. This action proved so controversial that Congress invoked the seldom-used Congressional Review Act (CRA) to invalidate those BIAS-specific privacy rules in 2017. Under the CRA, the invalidation of the old rules means that the agency may not adopt new rules that are \"substantially the same\" as the old ones without further authorization from Congress. By exempting BIAS providers from the agency's recently-adopted data security rules and leaving BIAS privacy issues to case-by-case adjudication under Section 201(b) and Section 222(a), and giving BIAS providers \"leeway in the details of how they go about complying with those obligations to a materially greater extent than the much more prescriptive 2016 rules,\" the Order attempts to protect this aspect of its holdings from CRA-based attacks. It remains to be seen whether this protection will prove sufficient on appeal.\n\nThe Order restores Section 224 pole attachment protections to BIAS-only providers, including both wireline and wireless providers, giving them the same rights as cable system operators and telecommunications service providers to non-discriminatory access to investor owned utility poles guaranteed by Section 224(f). In addition, ISPs attaching to such poles in 26 states where pole attachment rates, terms and conditions are regulated by the FCC may now avail themselves of FCC rules which, among other things, establish pole access timelines, limit pole attachment rates and allocation of pole-related costs, and establish procedures for resolving pole attachment disputes.\n\nMoreover, the classification will automatically apply in two \"reverse preemption\" states that have adopted FCC pole attachment rules outright (Pennsylvania and West Virginia) and in states that have limited preemption of the FCC's regulation to cable television system access. Notably, some of the remaining states that have reverse preempted the FCC already have extended their rules to cover broadband service providers. Other reverse preemption states may choose to amend their laws to ensure that their pole attachment rules cover BIAS providers.\n\nIn response to comments filed by the California Public Utility Commission, the FCC also declared that reclassification provides states with the requisite legal authority to protect public safety concerns associated with broadband-only infrastructure. While this may bolster a state's ability to extend existing regulations to broadband, a state's ability to do so will also depend on the specific state laws governing this area.\n\nSection 253 of the Act (for any telecommunications carrier) and Section 332 of the Act (for wireless carriers) protect against state or local governments taking actions that unduly interfere with the ability of a carrier to enter a market and offer its services, including, specifically, unreasonable or discriminatory restrictions on access to public rights-of-way for placing communications facilities. With reclassification, BIAS providers may now seek FCC or court intervention under those provisions when state or local regulations effectively prohibit the provision of BIAS services including by restricting competitive deployment.\n\nThe FCC concluded that reclassification of BIAS means that the agency's rules regarding the provision of telecommunications or cable services in MTEs (such as apartment and office buildings) now apply to BIAS-only providers. According to the FCC, it may now require BIAS-only providers to comply with the same requirements that apply to telecommunications and cable providers in MTEs, including rules that prohibit exclusive access and service contracts, as well as \"graduated revenue sharing\" where the landlord/owner receives greater compensation as the percentage of residents taking the service rises.\n\nBecause BIAS is now classified as a telecommunications service, BIAS services and equipment must be made accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities in accordance with Part 6 of the FCC rules. As noted by the FCC, people who are deaf, hard of hearing, deafblind, or have speech disabilities increasingly rely on IP-based video conferencing services to communicate. These services, like IP-based video relay service, require multiparty synchronous high definition video to accommodate sign language communication. Practically speaking, this means that BIAS providers may not adopt network management practices that have the effect of degrading the connections carrying video communications of persons with hearing and disabilities, such as blocking or throttling, bandwidth limits, data caps, or requirements to pay additional fees to obtain sufficient capacity. It also means that the means for accessing BIAS and any customer support for BIAS, including bills and technical support, must also be accessible to persons with disabilities.\n\nIn the 2015 Open Internet Order, the FCC described the extension of its accessibility rules to BIAS as essentially already covered by its accessibility rules governing Advanced Communications Services (\"ACS\"). The current Order, however, acknowledges a distinction, stating clearly for first time that BIAS is not ACS. Notably, BIAS, like traditional telecom and interconnected VoIP services, is subject to a lower standard of achievement (\"readily achievable,\" i.e., accomplishable without much difficulty or expense) than applies to ACS (\"achievable,\" i.e., with reasonable effort or expense). However, video conferencing services that rely upon BIAS are a form of ACS, so this may be a distinction without a purpose.\n\nThe main policy justification for reclassifying broadband as a telecommunications service in the 2015 Open Internet Order was that broadband providers had the incentive and ability to interfere with people's ability to access the online content they wanted. Expressly barring BIAS providers from such interference would protect the \"virtuous cycle\" of innovation by edge providers driving demand for broadband, leading to increased investment in broadband infrastructure.\n\nThe Order certainly mentions the importance of the \"virtuous cycle\" but does not emphasize it. Instead, the policy focus of the Order is that treating BIAS as a telecommunications service will allow the FCC to protect national security, promote cybersecurity, enhance public safety, monitor and enhance network resiliency and reliability, and protect consumer privacy and data security.\n\nThis shift in policy emphasis does not directly affect the agency's legal analysis underlying the Order's reclassification of broadband. At the same time, this shift is not merely cosmetic. Whatever may have been true a decade ago, today the Internet is so deeply embedded in the country's cultural, political, and economic life – and the international environment is so much more tense – that the risks of leaving this critical infrastructure unmonitored and unregulated are, from the agency's perspective, too great. The time since the Open Internet Order has seen a vast increase in remote work, remote learning, and remote healthcare – driven by the COVID-19 pandemic – all of which depend on a robust, resilient, reliable Internet. During that same time, the FCC has banned the use of certain Chinese equipment in United States telecommunications networks and barred certain Chinese entities from owning those networks. Classifying broadband as a telecommunications service is the most straightforward and direct way under existing law to bring broadband networks under federal supervision.\n\nThis shift in policy emphasis also constitutes a form of \"political insurance\" for reclassification if Republicans retake control of the agency following the 2024 election. The 2015 Open Internet Order was framed as an exercise of economic and consumer protection regulation, which made it an easy target for a deregulation-minded Republican-controlled FCC. But even if a new Republican majority in 2025 is skeptical of the need to regulate BIAS to protect consumers and encourage investment, promoting national security and protecting critical infrastructure against foreign adversaries – the focus of the Order – are likely to retain bipartisan appeal. The shift in policy emphasis in the Order may make it less likely that a future Commission would reverse the reclassification of broadband as a telecommunications service.\n\nEvery major court decision addressing an FCC ruling classifying broadband either as a telecommunications service or as an information service has expressly and heavily relied on the Chevron doctrine, under which courts defer to an agency's interpretation of its own statute if that interpretation is, broadly speaking, reasonable. The Supreme Court in Brand X relied on Chevron to uphold the FCC's then-current classification of cable broadband as an information service. The D.C. Circuit in USTA relied on Chevron to uphold the FCC's 2015 reclassification of broadband, in the Open Internet Order, as a telecommunications service. And the D.C. Circuit in Mozilla relied on Chevron to uphold (for the most part) the FCC's 2017 second reclassification of broadband, in the RIF Order, as (again) an information service.\n\nIf Chevron remains good law, courts may view the Order as reflecting a reasonable reading of the definitions in the Communications Act as applied to broadband – just as occurred with the 2015 Open Internet Order – and defer to the Commission's reclassification. But it is widely anticipated that the current Supreme Court, perhaps even this term, will cut back on the scope of Chevron. If that happens, reviewing courts may be less likely to defer and instead would have more leeway to determine not just whether the FCC's current interpretation of the Act is broadly reasonable, but also whether that interpretation represents the \"best\" or \"correct\" reading of the law. Anticipating this possibility, the Order takes great pains to explain why, in the agency's view, its reading of the law is not only reasonable but is, in fact, correct – an apparent effort to protect its reclassification decision against the possible demise of Chevron.\n\nIn this regard, while opponents of excessive regulation generally favor cutting back on Chevron, here a victory on that issue could be a double-edged sword. If Chevron is no longer good law, and if it turns out that the courts agree with the FCC that the Communications Act requires treating broadband as a telecommunications service, this would limit the ability of even a future conservative, deregulation-minded FCC to reclassify and deregulate broadband service.\n\nSince the time of the FCC's 2015 Open Internet Order, the Supreme Court has, on several occasions, clarified and expanded the major question doctrine, which says that agencies are not permitted to interpret a broad, general grant of authority as including the power to decide \"major questions\" – that is, questions with \"vast economic and political significance.\" Under this doctrine, for an agency to address such questions requires express authorization from Congress. Some opponents of classifying broadband as a telecommunications service argued before the FCC that this would constitute action on a \"major question,\" which, they argue, is a step the agency may not take because Congress has not expressly authorized it.\n\nThe Order rejects that claim, for several reasons. It argues that the major question doctrine does not apply to this decision at all, since regulating communications networks is the agency's core function. It notes that Congress has not provided any guidance on the question of classification of Internet access (both broadband and dial-up) even though the agency has addressed the issue in a range of contexts since at least 1998; according to the Order, this indicates that Congress is content to leave the issue to the agency's discretion. And the agency argues that treating broadband as a telecommunications service simply does not have the \"vast economic and political significance\" required to bring the major question doctrine into play.\n\nGiven the Supreme Court's expansion of the major question doctrine in recent years, it is highly likely that parties opposing the Order will raise this issue as part of their challenges in court.\n\nDWT's communications and privacy and security groups are familiar with all aspects of the new net neutrality regime. Readers should feel free to reach out to us with any questions about how the new rules will apply to or affect BIAS provider operations going forward.",

    "description": "A veteran civil rights attorney won a landmark redistricting case. He fears such wins could soon vanish.",
    "fullText": "The beleaguered Voting Rights Act is on the ropes again — and it may soon suffer a crippling strike.\n\nThe Supreme Court seems on the verge of making it much harder to use the landmark civil rights measure to force states to draw districts where minority candidates stand a strong chance of winning. And a key provision that lets private groups sue under the 60-year-old law could be the next to fall.\n\nThat would be a huge blow to civil rights lawyers like Mississippi’s Carroll Rhodes, who’s spent his career leveraging the Voting Rights Act to increase the political power of Black people and other minorities.\n\n“It becomes almost an impossible hill to climb,” Rhodes told POLITICO Magazine.\n\nOver the past decade or so, the VRA has been battered by a series of hits from the increasingly conservative high court. In 2013, the justices knocked out a key pillar of the law by eliminating “pre-clearance” requirements for advance approval of voting changes, including redistricting, in most or all of nine states and a smattering of localities.\n\nIn recent months, petitions have stacked up at the Supreme Court that could lead to the justices wiping out the long-assumed right of private groups and individuals to bring lawsuits under the law. And, earlier this month, the high court blocked a lower court’s Voting Rights Act ruling and gave Texas a green light to redraw its congressional map at President Donald Trump’s request in order to give Republicans up to five additional House seats.\n\nDespite those challenges, litigators like Rhodes have had significant success harnessing the VRA. A lawsuit he pressed forced redistricting and a special election in Mississippi last month led to Black Democrats picking up two additional seats in the state’s House. The incremental gain broke a longstanding GOP supermajority in a state that is nearly 40 percent Black — the highest percentage in the nation. Those sorts of advances for minority representation could come to a halt if the Supreme Court rules against the law.\n\nI reached Rhodes at his law office in the small town of Hazelhurst, Miss. and asked him to take stock of the bruises the VRA has sustained, the threats it faces at the moment and how he’s managed to use the law to advance minority power in his home state.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThe Voting Rights Act has taken a lot of major hits from the Supreme Court in the past couple decades. Many lawyers now see it as teetering on the brink of irrelevance or impotence. What are the stakes in the pending case, Louisiana v. Callais, and whether states doing redistricting can sometimes make use of race to comply with the VRA?\n\nSome people are concerned that the Voting Rights Act might be on its way out, but I'm an eternal optimist. Given that the Voting Rights Act was passed by Congress pursuant to the 15th Amendment, and the 15th Amendment guarantees the right to vote on an equal basis, not on account of race, to everyone — I think in the Callais case that they're going to resolve that issue in favor of [the law] being upheld.\n\nYou’ve had considerable success in Mississippi with the Voting Rights Act and the state legislature there. Does that confound perceptions that the VRA is at death’s door?\n\nWe have been successful. A lot of civil rights organizations and civil rights opponents have been successful in using the Voting Rights Act to increase the number of Black elected officials.\n\nIn Mississippi, for the most part, whites do not vote for Black candidates in contested elections, and that's why the Voting Rights Act has been so successful in creating Black majority districts.\n\nWhen you have a minority population that's large enough, concentrated enough, and they're in these election districts where they cannot elect candidates of their choice — because the majority population always votes against their candidates of choice — you have to redraw the districts in such a way so you give this large, geographically insular minority group the ability to elect the representative of their choice. And Mississippi's demographics have made it easier for us to be successful here.\n\nHas there been a concrete impact to this?\n\nThere was a time where we had 45 or 50 Black people elected from Black majority districts in the Mississippi Legislature. And there were Black chairmen of different committees, even the powerful committees. But what has happened over the years, more and more white Democrats have left the Democratic Party and gone toward the Republican Party, so now you have a [GOP] supermajority in the Senate. We broke that in this last election.\n\nWhen you break the supermajority in the Senate, money bills, especially taxing and spending, budget, a lot of times it takes a supermajority to get those bills passed. If there is no supermajority, then that means that the Republican leadership within the Senate will have to negotiate with most of the Black people elected as Democrats.\n\nHave those legislators been able to use this effective veto to actually get some spending concessions in terms of, “You're going to spend in this part of the state or on these types of programs?”\n\nWe won't know yet because the special election just took place, and the legislature comes back in January. So, we will see if this cohesive group of Black Democrats can get some concessions.\n\nIn 2013, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the Shelby County decision, which ended the requirement that many states, including Mississippi, most places across the South and a few in the North, had to submit any voting changes — including redistricting — to the Justice Department to get approved. The maps that Mississippi adopted in 2022, which you successfully challenged in court, were they put in place initially because of the Shelby County decision?\n\nThey were able to do it directly because of Shelby County, yes. And John Roberts got it wrong. I agree with Justice Ginsburg who said at the time, it’s like standing up under the umbrella and it's not raining and saying, “Oh, it's not raining, so you can let the umbrella down.” That's what that Roberts decision did: took the umbrella down. And rain is falling everywhere.\n\nUnder the process essentially abandoned after Shelby County, the maps had to be submitted to Washington, and that took place under presidents both Republican and Democrat. The maps that you challenged, do you think President Obama's Justice Department would have approved them? What about President George W. Bush’s Justice Department or President Donald Trump’s Justice Department?\n\nThe Trump Justice Department would have approved them, but no other president. And I'm going to go back to Obama, Biden, Clinton, I'd even go back to Ronald Reagan. The strange thing is that Ronald Reagan initially was opposed to the Voting Rights Act extension in 1982 but wound up signing it and cited it as the crown jewel of American democracy. And so the Trump Justice Department probably is the only one, because the Trump Justice Department had flipped what the purpose of the Voting Rights Act was — to protect minority voters — to say it's to protect white voters.\n\nRoberts has been on the court now for 22 years. The first decade and a half or so, he was viewed uniformly as hostile to voting rights enforcement. That was seen as one of his animating issues. But there have been a few decisions in recent years where the court has not been as aggressive toward the Voting Rights Act as some expected. It seems like Roberts went along with this current Callais case being punted for a year, which basically left those districts in place through the current election cycle. Is there something going on with Roberts? Do you think he has shifted or moderated at all?\n\nMy personal take is that he really is really an incrementalist. He's not for upending longstanding precedent and what the country has become accustomed to. He believes in incremental changes and I think the Shelby County decision came about because he genuinely thought that so much advancement had been made in this area that it was no longer necessary for those protections. And I think after Shelby County, he's seen that those protections are still needed. His views might be moderating somewhat. He might see the damage that Shelby County decision has caused.\n\nYou've had this span of four or five decades to look at how these things have developed. How has technology changed this process of redistricting? Has it made it easier for those trying to dilute the power of minority voters to do that, and have people on your side of the fight been able to harness that technology in any similar fashion to fight back against those efforts?\n\nWhen I first started out in this area, the map drawers used maps and pencils and even had notepads to add before the calculators came. Then calculators and then the programs and social science has developed over the years, too. Statistical analysis has become more and more sophisticated, and the technology has become more and more sophisticated.\n\nMy take is that whoever writes the algorithm, whoever writes the code, the code can be written in such a way that it could lead to more discrimination and make it harder to undo.\n\nWe do have folks on our side who are using technology, but technology was used in the Texas case to draw districts in such a way that discriminated against Black and Latino voters in Texas.\n\nYou were a teenager when a lot of these landmark civil rights laws were passed in the ‘60s. Do you personally have memories of what the Jim Crow South was like? Did any of your relatives experience some of these more bizarre tests that were used for decades before that to exclude Black people from voting, like, ‘How many bubbles are in a bar of soap?’ or ‘How many jelly beans are in the jar?’\n\nOh, yes. I was born in ‘51. I grew up in a segregated neighborhood, went to an all-Black high school, segregated high school, segregated elementary school. I remember going to the dentist. And the dentist office had two entrances, one for white, one for “colored,” and going through the white side, they had air conditioning. They had magazines. The “colored” side did not.\n\nWe had field trips to the courthouse, where the courthouse had white and “colored” water fountains. And we had to sit in the balcony. I remember a third grade field trip to the courthouse and we watched a trial where a white lawyer was defending a Black man accused of some crime. And he was saying, “This was a good Nigra” — N-I-G-R-A.\n\nAnd so I grew up through it and I also remember my parents when the Voting Rights Act was first passed, and they did have federal registrars around, but all of the neighbors, my parents and everybody not only did they go and register to vote, they voted in every election, no matter what.\n\nThere were people telling us stories. Tim Winston owned a funeral home here and he was one of the few Black people who was able to register prior to the Voting Rights Act being passed, and he told stories of how they were turning away Black folks by asking them ridiculous questions. So, yeah, I remember, personally, stories of how hard it was before the Voting Rights Act was passed and after it was passed.\n\nIf the Voting Rights Act Section Two were to be knocked out and it wasn't a tool you could use anymore, what would be the strategy after that? Would that mean there's no option for civil rights groups? What is the world going to look like if the VRA is not available for private groups to litigate?\n\nIt almost becomes an impossible hill to climb. You have to go back to the 15th Amendment and prove intentional discrimination, which is difficult, or the 14th Amendment and prove intentional discrimination, which is difficult. All a legislative body has to do is say, “We didn't draw the district based on race. We drew them based on partisanship, and they're entitled to the presumption that there was a good faith effort to do that, and it's hard.” We had overwhelming evidence in Texas that partisanship was not the real reason. If that cannot overcome a presumption that the legislator was acting in good faith, going forward, it's going to be impossible to prove a racial gerrymandering claim.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the federal Constitution puts no limits on partisan gerrymandering, even as the justices continue to aggressively police use of race in redistricting. Is that line meaningful?\n\nRace and party, in Mississippi, there’s no distinction. It’s a fiction.",

    "fullText": "Decision from state supreme court on deal once worth $56bn and now worth some $139bn overturns ruling that prompted angry Musk backlash\n\nElon Musk’s controversial $56bn pay package from Tesla was reinstated by the Delaware supreme court on Friday, two years after a lower court struck down the vast compensation deal as “unfathomable”.\n\nThe reinstated pay package could be worth as much as $139bn today, according to the New York Times. The decision comes less than two months after Tesla shareholders approved a new plan that could be worth $1tn to Musk, already the world’s richest person, in a decade’s time. Musk’s fortune currently stands at an estimated $600bn.\n\nRescinding the pay deal would be “inequitable”, and would leave Musk “uncompensated for his time and efforts over a period of six years”, the Delaware supreme court justices wrote, echoing arguments from Tesla board members earlier this year.\n\nAt the company’s annual meeting in Austin, Texas, this November, shareholders had approved a stopgap measure for Musk, ensuring – regardless of how the Delaware supreme court ruled on this appeal – that he would get the $56bn his supporters say he is owed.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment or \n\nBoth of the compensation packages, as well as other pay plans approved by Tesla shareholders, require Musk to meet a number of lofty goals related to product development and increasing the company’s value to $8.5tn in order to cash out on those awards.\n\nThe case that first invalidated the original pay package was launched seven years ago when a Tesla stockholder, who held just nine shares at the time, filed a suit arguing that the plan was set up to overpay the world’s richest person. That first ruling voided the billions Musk was to receive, which left the Tesla co-founder less than pleased.\n\nNot only did Musk relocate Tesla to Texas from Delaware, where it was incorporated at the time the suit began, he also publicly lashed out against the state and specifically its court of chancery and chief judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick.\n\n“She has done more to damage Delaware than any judge in modern history,” he wrote on X, his social media platform, in February 2024.\n\nTesla stockholders in 2024 were again asked to vote on the 2018 pay package. They approved it, and once again, McCormick struck it down, ruling that the “Superstar CEO”, as she called him, had undue influence in developing his own pay package and that stockholders weren’t fully informed ahead of the vote.\n\nMusk has voiced his displeasure ever since.\n\n“Any lawyer still recommending incorporation in Delaware at this point should be sued for malpractice,” he posted online earlier this year.\n\nIn Friday’s opinion, the justices agreed with McCormick’s earlier findings that there was a breach of fiduciary duty in developing the original package and presenting it to shareholders. They ordered $1 be paid to the plaintiff in nominal damages.\n\nHowever, the five judges agreed that rescinding Musk’s full pay package wasn’t appropriate.\n\nWhile Musk has publicly called for other companies to follow his lead and leave Delaware – which has historically been home to more than 60% of Fortune 500 companies – experts have tracked only a few dozen companies that have actually done so. That includes big companies including Dropbox and Coinbase, while other tech companies like Meta have only threatened to leave.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk is entitled to his $55.8 billion Tesla pay package from 2018, Delaware's Supreme Court ruled.\n\nA Delaware Chancery Court judge struck down the compensation package last year after a Tesla shareholder sued over the massive payday, which was tied to a series of growth goalposts for the EV company.\n\nThe Delaware Supreme Court's ruling overturns that decision, saying it was too extreme a remedy.\n\nTesla shareholders recently approved an even bigger pay package of up to $1 trillion for Musk if Tesla achieves further sales and growth goals.\n\nThe decision to withhold his 2018 pay package prompted Musk to criticize Delaware on several occasions. Delaware's long-standing reputation for being business-friendly is rooted in the Delaware General Corporation Law, which serves as the foundation of its corporate law.\n\n\"Companies should get the hell out of Delaware,\" Musk wrote on X in August 2024.\n\nAt the time, two of Musk's companies — Tesla and SpaceX — were incorporated in Delaware. He moved those companies to Texas in 2024.\n\nDespite Delaware's position as a central incorporation hub, a series of court rulings left some prominent companies wondering if they could find stronger legal protections somewhere else, including VC firm Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nThe firm announced in July that its primary business, AH Capital Management, would no longer be incorporated in Delaware because \"legal uncertainty\" had worried investors and entrepreneurs on its board.\n\n\"As a result, many of the companies we fund and the entrepreneurs that we talk to are taking a second look at whether they should incorporate in other jurisdictions, prompted by the departure from Delaware of significant technology companies like Dropbox, Tripadvisor, and Tesla,\" the firm said in a blog post.\n\nThe firm said it's reincorporating in Nevada, an increasingly popular alternative.\n\nBusinesses incorporated in Delaware account for a large chunk of the state's revenue. As of 2024, more than 2.1 million businesses were incorporated in Delaware, meaning a widespread exodus could do serious damage to its economy.\n\nEven so, Delaware Secretary of State Charuni Patibanda-Sanchez told Business Insider that officials aren't spooked by the \"political rhetoric.\"\n\n\"What our data is showing is that Delaware is still the preeminent place to incorporate your business,\" she said.\n\nPatibanda-Sanchez added: \"We don't believe that Delaware's position as the corporate leader and corporate capital of the world is being threatened in any significant way. We always come under threat, though, because states are always trying to get a piece of the action.\"",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court sided with immigration judges on Friday, rebuffing the Trump administration for now in a case with possible implications for federal workers as the justices weigh expanding presidential firing power.\n\nThe decision is a technical step in a long-running case, but it touches on the effects of a series of high-profile firings under President Donald Trump. The justices let stand a ruling that raised questions about the Trump administration's handling of the federal workforce, though they also signaled that lower courts should move cautiously.\n\nImmigration judges are federal employees, and the question at the center of the appeal is about whether they can sue to challenge a policy restricting their public speeches or if they are required to use a separate complaint system for the federal workforce.\n\nTrump's Republican administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene after an appeals court found that Trump’s firings of top complaint system officials had raised questions about whether it's still working as intended.\n\nThe Justice Department said the firings are within the president’s power and the lower court had no grounds to raise questions. The solicitor general asked the Supreme Court to quickly freeze the ruling as he pushes to have the immigration judges’ case removed from federal court.\n\nThe justices declined, though they also said the Trump administration could return if the lower courts moved too fast. There were no noted dissents. The court has allowed most of Trump’s firings for now and is weighing whether to formally expand his legal power to fire independent agency officials by overturning job protections enshrined in a 90-year-old decision.\n\nA union formerly representing immigration judges, who work for the Justice Department, first sued in 2020 to challenge a policy restricting what the judges can speak about in public. They say the case is a free-speech issue that belongs in federal court.\n\nRamya Krishnan, an attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute who argued the case on the union's behalf, applauded the high court's Friday decision. “The restrictions on immigration judges’ free speech rights are unconstitutional, and it’s intolerable that this prior restraint is still in place,” Krishnan said.\n\nIn recent months, the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has included firing dozens of immigration judges who are seen by his allies as too lenient.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to an email message seeking comment Friday.\n\nWhile the order is not a final decision, the case could eventually have implications for other federal workers who want to challenge firings in court rather than the employee complaint system now largely overseen by Trump appointees.\n\nThe decision comes after a series of wins for the Justice Department on the high court’s emergency docket. The court has sided with the Trump administration about two dozen times on issues ranging from immigration to federal funding.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court.",

    "fullText": "JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A judge on Friday ordered special elections for the Mississippi Supreme Court after earlier finding that the electoral map used to select justices violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nU.S. District Judge Sharion Aycock in August ordered Mississippi to redraw the map, which was enacted in 1987, concluding the current configuration dilutes the power of Black voters. The Friday ruling gives the Mississippi Legislature until the end of its 2026 regular session to redraw the map.\n\nSection 2, which is the primary way plaintiffs can push back against racially discriminatory election practices, is currently being challenged at the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nOnce the legislature approves a new map, Aycock wrote that she will move quickly to meet any deadlines necessary to hold the special elections in November 2026.\n\nAycock also wrote that she will defer deciding which seats will be subject to a special election until after the new map has been adopted.\n\nThe order follows a 2022 lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union, which argued the current map cuts Mississippi’s Delta region — a historically Black area — in half, diminishing the Black vote in the Central District.\n\n“Mississippi is nearly 40% Black, but has never had more than one Black Justice on the nine-member Court,\" Ari Savitzky, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project, wrote in a statement. \"We couldn’t be happier to see justice on the horizon.”\n\nIn her August ruling, Aycock noted only four Black people have served on Mississippi’s Supreme Court. All of them held the same seat in the Central District and were first appointed to the position by a sitting governor.\n\nThe Mississippi Secretary of State’s Office is appealing Aycock’s August ruling. The Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has stayed its proceedings pending the outcomes of the SCOTUS case and other related cases.\n\nThe Mississippi Secretary of State and Attorney General’s offices did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn December, two Mississippi Supreme Court justices were appointed to federal judgeships. Gov. Tate Reeves will appoint replacements to serve until new justices can be elected.\n\nIn Mississippi, Supreme Court elections are nonpartisan.",
