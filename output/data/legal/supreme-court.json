    "fullText": "Elon Musk is entitled to his $55.8 billion Tesla pay package from 2018, Delaware's Supreme Court ruled.\n\nA Delaware Chancery Court judge struck down the compensation package last year after a Tesla shareholder sued over the massive payday, which was tied to a series of growth goalposts for the EV company.\n\nThe Delaware Supreme Court's ruling overturns that decision, saying it was too extreme a remedy.\n\nTesla shareholders recently approved an even bigger pay package of up to $1 trillion for Musk if Tesla achieves further sales and growth goals.\n\nThe decision to withhold his 2018 pay package prompted Musk to criticize Delaware on several occasions. Delaware's long-standing reputation for being business-friendly is rooted in the Delaware General Corporation Law, which serves as the foundation of its corporate law.\n\n\"Companies should get the hell out of Delaware,\" Musk wrote on X in August 2024.\n\nAt the time, two of Musk's companies — Tesla and SpaceX — were incorporated in Delaware. He moved those companies to Texas in 2024.\n\nDespite Delaware's position as a central incorporation hub, a series of court rulings left some prominent companies wondering if they could find stronger legal protections somewhere else, including VC firm Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nThe firm announced in July that its primary business, AH Capital Management, would no longer be incorporated in Delaware because \"legal uncertainty\" had worried investors and entrepreneurs on its board.\n\n\"As a result, many of the companies we fund and the entrepreneurs that we talk to are taking a second look at whether they should incorporate in other jurisdictions, prompted by the departure from Delaware of significant technology companies like Dropbox, Tripadvisor, and Tesla,\" the firm said in a blog post.\n\nThe firm said it's reincorporating in Nevada, an increasingly popular alternative.\n\nBusinesses incorporated in Delaware account for a large chunk of the state's revenue. As of 2024, more than 2.1 million businesses were incorporated in Delaware, meaning a widespread exodus could do serious damage to its economy.\n\nEven so, Delaware Secretary of State Charuni Patibanda-Sanchez told Business Insider that officials aren't spooked by the \"political rhetoric.\"\n\n\"What our data is showing is that Delaware is still the preeminent place to incorporate your business,\" she said.\n\nPatibanda-Sanchez added: \"We don't believe that Delaware's position as the corporate leader and corporate capital of the world is being threatened in any significant way. We always come under threat, though, because states are always trying to get a piece of the action.\"",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court sided with immigration judges on Friday, rebuffing the Trump administration for now in a case with possible implications for federal workers as the justices weigh expanding presidential firing power.\n\nThe decision is a technical step in a long-running case, but it touches on the effects of a series of high-profile firings under President Donald Trump. The justices let stand a ruling that raised questions about the Trump administration's handling of the federal workforce, though they also signaled that lower courts should move cautiously.\n\nImmigration judges are federal employees, and the question at the center of the appeal is about whether they can sue to challenge a policy restricting their public speeches or if they are required to use a separate complaint system for the federal workforce.\n\nTrump's Republican administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene after an appeals court found that Trump’s firings of top complaint system officials had raised questions about whether it's still working as intended.\n\nThe Justice Department said the firings are within the president’s power and the lower court had no grounds to raise questions. The solicitor general asked the Supreme Court to quickly freeze the ruling as he pushes to have the immigration judges’ case removed from federal court.\n\nThe justices declined, though they also said the Trump administration could return if the lower courts moved too fast. There were no noted dissents. The court has allowed most of Trump’s firings for now and is weighing whether to formally expand his legal power to fire independent agency officials by overturning job protections enshrined in a 90-year-old decision.\n\nA union formerly representing immigration judges, who work for the Justice Department, first sued in 2020 to challenge a policy restricting what the judges can speak about in public. They say the case is a free-speech issue that belongs in federal court.\n\nRamya Krishnan, an attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute who argued the case on the union's behalf, applauded the high court's Friday decision. “The restrictions on immigration judges’ free speech rights are unconstitutional, and it’s intolerable that this prior restraint is still in place,” Krishnan said.\n\nIn recent months, the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has included firing dozens of immigration judges who are seen by his allies as too lenient.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to an email message seeking comment Friday.\n\nWhile the order is not a final decision, the case could eventually have implications for other federal workers who want to challenge firings in court rather than the employee complaint system now largely overseen by Trump appointees.\n\nThe decision comes after a series of wins for the Justice Department on the high court’s emergency docket. The court has sided with the Trump administration about two dozen times on issues ranging from immigration to federal funding.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court.",

    "fullText": "JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A judge on Friday ordered special elections for the Mississippi Supreme Court after earlier finding that the electoral map used to select justices violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nU.S. District Judge Sharion Aycock in August ordered Mississippi to redraw the map, which was enacted in 1987, concluding the current configuration dilutes the power of Black voters. The Friday ruling gives the Mississippi Legislature until the end of its 2026 regular session to redraw the map.\n\nSection 2, which is the primary way plaintiffs can push back against racially discriminatory election practices, is currently being challenged at the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nOnce the legislature approves a new map, Aycock wrote that she will move quickly to meet any deadlines necessary to hold the special elections in November 2026.\n\nAycock also wrote that she will defer deciding which seats will be subject to a special election until after the new map has been adopted.\n\nThe order follows a 2022 lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union, which argued the current map cuts Mississippi’s Delta region — a historically Black area — in half, diminishing the Black vote in the Central District.\n\n“Mississippi is nearly 40% Black, but has never had more than one Black Justice on the nine-member Court,\" Ari Savitzky, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project, wrote in a statement. \"We couldn’t be happier to see justice on the horizon.”\n\nIn her August ruling, Aycock noted only four Black people have served on Mississippi’s Supreme Court. All of them held the same seat in the Central District and were first appointed to the position by a sitting governor.\n\nThe Mississippi Secretary of State’s Office is appealing Aycock’s August ruling. The Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has stayed its proceedings pending the outcomes of the SCOTUS case and other related cases.\n\nThe Mississippi Secretary of State and Attorney General’s offices did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn December, two Mississippi Supreme Court justices were appointed to federal judgeships. Gov. Tate Reeves will appoint replacements to serve until new justices can be elected.\n\nIn Mississippi, Supreme Court elections are nonpartisan.",
