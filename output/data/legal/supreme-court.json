    "description": "The Supreme Court fast-tracked a case over whether President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court struck down a chunk of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff policy on Friday, ruling that the White House exceeded its authority.\n\nThe 6-3 decision centered on the tariffs Trump justified under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a national security law that allows the president to regulate economic activity during emergencies.\n\nThose IEEPA-justified tariffs have been one of Trump's most powerful weapons in his efforts to renegotiate trade agreements around the globe. They include Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, announced in April, which are at least 10% on nearly every country in the world.\n\nIn the majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the Trump administration's use of the law to impose taxes on imports, which is normally the purview of Congress, went too far. Trump would need a distinct law from Congress \"to justify his extraordinary assertion of the power to impose tariffs,\" he wrote.\n\n\"What common sense suggests, congressional practice confirms,\" he wrote. \"When Congress has delegated its tariff powers, it has done so in explicit terms, and subject to strict limits.\"\n\nThe majority decision was joined by four separate concurring opinions, by Justices Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barnett, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson. They all supplied different arguments on how important it was for the Supreme Court to consult legislative history and invoke the \"major questions doctrine\" — the idea that presidents need clear Congressional authorization for decisions of significant political and economic importance.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision comes as the United States trade deficit ticked down over the last year, largely due to the Trump administration's tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods. It shrank to $29.4 billion in October, the lowest figure since 2009, before ticking back up in the last two months of the year, Commerce Department data published Thursday showed.\n\nTwo groups of businesses filed lawsuits challenging Trump's authority to impose tariffs through IEEPA. The Supreme Court combined the cases and put them on the fast track, holding oral arguments at the beginning of its November term.\n\nIEEPA, a Carter-era law, gives presidents the power to \"regulate\" importation in times of emergency. The Trump administration claimed that it included the ability to impose tariffs — a position no other president has taken.\n\nLawyers representing the businesses argued that Congress would have been clear if IEEPA were meant to confer taxation and tariff powers to the president.\n\nDuring oral arguments, most justices expressed skepticism about the Trump administration's arguments. Justice Neil Gorsuch, whom Trump appointed to the bench in his first term, said taxes were \"part of the spark of the American Revolution\" and should get careful treatment.\n\n\"The power to reach into the pockets of the American people is just different,\" Gorsuch said. \"And it's been different since the founding.\"\n\nJustices Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito dissented from the majority. In his opinion, Kavanaugh said the language of IEEPA ought to support tariffs.\n\n\"Interpreting IEEPA to exclude tariffs creates nonsensical textual and practical anomalies,\" he wrote. \"The plaintiffs and the Court do not dispute that the President can act in declared emergencies under IEEPA to impose quotas or even total embargoes on all imports from a given country. But the President supposedly cannot take the far more modest step of conditioning those imports on payment of a tariff or duty.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling does not affect the tariffs that Trump has imposed using other laws, and Trump still has the power to issue additional tariffs using those laws, as Kavanaugh noted in his opinion.\n\nBut his administration has favored IEEPA because of its perceived flexibility. The other laws that allow presidents to impose tariffs without explicit Congressional approval have limits — including built-in expiration dates and caps on the amount taxed. They also make it more difficult to target particular countries, rather than certain industries.",

    "title": "Why SCOTUS' rejection of Biden's student-loan forgiveness plays a big role in its Trump tariff decision",
    "description": "The Supreme Court said its rationale for overturning most of Trump's tariffs was the same one it used to strike down Biden's student-loan forgiveness.",
    "fullText": "What do broad student-loan forgiveness and tariffs have in common? More than you might think, according to the nation's highest court.\n\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court struck down most of President Donald Trump's tariffs, ruling that he lacked the authority to enact his expansive tariff policies under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. While IEEPA allows the president to regulate economic activity during emergencies, the Supreme Court said that Trump's tariffs went beyond the law's threshold.\n\nIf that argument sounds familiar, it's because it's the same one the Supreme Court made in 2023 when it struck down former President Joe Biden's broad student-loan forgiveness plan.\n\nAs Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in his concurring opinion on Friday, the court requires \"clear congressional authorization\" to carry out broad economic policies like student-loan forgiveness or tariffs.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts echoed that in his tariff opinion, writing that in Biden v. Nebraska, the student-debt ruling, the court \"declined to read authorization to 'waive or modify' statutory or regulatory provisions applicable to financial assistance programs as a delegation of power to cancel $430 billion in student loan debt.\"\n\nRoberts referred to the major questions doctrine, which requires federal agencies to have clear, congressional authorization — not ambiguous legal language — before enacting broad economic policies. He said that while Trump's administration said that the doctrine should not apply in the tariff case, that \"argument is nearly identical to one it already advanced\" in the student-debt case.\n\n\"There, the Government contended that a different emergency statute should be interpreted broadly because its 'whole point' was to provide 'substantial discretion to . . . respond to unforeseen emergencies,'\" Roberts wrote. \"We rejected that argument in Nebraska, and we reject it here as well.\"\n\nBiden's student-loan forgiveness plan would have canceled up to $20,000 in debt for federal borrowers. Biden's administration was using the HEROES Act of 2003 to attempt to enact the relief, which gave the education secretary the ability to waive or modify student-loan balances in connection with a national emergency, like the pandemic. Just as it did in the tariff decision, the Supreme Court ruled at the time that the relief went beyond the law.\n\nTrump has not yet commented on the Supreme Court's ruling, and it does not affect the tariffs the president has imposed under laws other than IEEPA.",

    "description": "Major indexes rose on Friday, with investors looking past a weak GDP report after the Supreme Court ruled that Trump's tariffs are illegal.",
    "fullText": "Stocks rose on Friday after the Supreme Court ruled that Donald Trump's tariffs are illegal.\n\nUS stocks reversed earlier losses after the Supreme Court struck down the sweeping trade policy the president unveiled last April. The decision is a major update to an issue that's been a source of intense uncertainty and volatility for much of the last year, and will also raise new questions about how Trump might pursue his landmark policy push.\n\nHere's where major indexes stood around noon ET on Friday:\n\nThe news on tariffs outweighed a disappointing update on economic growth, while PCE inflation, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, heated up faster than expected. GDP grew 1.4% year-over-year last quarter, falling far short of estimates, while PCE rose 0.4% in December, slightly above the anticipated 0.3% gain.\n\n\"The market just totally erupted,\" Jose Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, told Business Insider. \"In the short run, it's good for corporate earnings.\"\n\nHere are four big takeaways for investors.\n\nThe Supreme Court blocked Trump's ability to impose tariffs through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law that allows the president to regulate economic activity in emergency events.\n\nBut there are a handful of other legal avenues the president could use to try to impose tariffs again, according to Michael Brown, a senior research strategist at Pepperstone.\n\n\"The Trump administration can impose pretty much the equivalent levies if they so wish to, which you'd imagine they do,\" he told Business Insider, adding that his outlook on US trade policy hadn't changed significantly over the long term.\n\n\"The president has already signalled that he will quickly pivot to other legal tools to achieve similar trade restrictions, and he has at his disposal multiple levers to pull in order to circumvent the verdict,\" Matthew Ryan, the head of market strategy at Ebury, wrote on Friday, adding that Trump's longer-term strategy for tariffs was \"unlikely to be derailed.\"\n\n\"The ball is now in the administration's court—specifically the willingness and ability to impose tariffs under alternative legal authorities,\" Mohamed El-Erian, a top economist and the chief economic advisor at Allianz, said in a post on X.\n\nShould Trump impose new tariffs, it's likely that import duties will be lower due to the legal precedent set by the SCOTUS ruling, according to Heather Long, the chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.\n\n\"In particular, it will be harder for the White House to impose tariffs without clear justification and due process. Businesses and consumers will get more clarity and lower rates going forward,\" Long wrote in a note on Friday.\n\nThe positive market reaction on Friday suggests that investors think tariff refunds are a possibility, according to Pepperstone's Brown.\n\nJoseph Brusuelas, the chief economist at RSM US, said he believed the US would likely issue between $100 billion and $130 billion in tariff refunds.\n\n\"When one thinks about the fiscal tailwind that may inject $100-150 billion in cash to American households this year in addition to tariff refunds we are talking real money,\" he wrote in a post on X, referring to the amount households are expected to get in tax refunds this year.\n\nIt's unclear how the refunds, if the US will issue any, will work, Long said.\n\n\"The refund process will be a mess,\" she wrote. \"It's likely the White House will fight against issuing refunds at all.\n\nBond yields ticked higher shortly after the Supreme Court ruling on tariffs, a sign that concerns are beginning to swell over the US debt picture again, now that tariff revenue, for the moment, has been taken off the table.\n\n\"Tariffs had been functioning as a shadow tax that helped fund spending without explicitly raising taxes. Remove that and the deficit widens, borrowing rises, and historically that is the type of development that leans on the bond market and pressures yields higher,\" Mark Malek, the CIO of Siebert Financial, wrote in a note on Friday.",

    "description": "The court heard arguments last year on whether Trump exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) when imposing tariffs on goods from virtually every US trading partner.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court scrambled the US trade landscape Friday when it struck down the centerpiece of President Trump’s second-term tariff program, ruling 6-3 that his sweeping blanket tariffs are illegal.\n\nThe ruling came just over one year into Trump’s second term and after skeptical questioning from key justices during oral arguments last November and appears set to immediately halt a massive section of Trump’s tariffs. Those tariffs were first announced last year on “Liberation Day” using a 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).\n\n“IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs,” read the decision, written by Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nTrump attacked the high court in his first response Friday, particularly the justices in the majority, saying they were a \"disgrace to our nation.\" He hinted that the administration would pursue alternative methods toward implementing its trade goals.\n\nThe ruling also raised the question of refunds, which could return an estimated $129 billion to importers in the months ahead. It upholds two lower courts — including the US Court of International Trade — that previously found Trump did not have the authority to impose global tariffs using the 1977 law.\n\nThe decision will likely have wide-ranging ramifications, affecting global trade, consumers, companies, inflation and the pocketbooks of every American. In recent weeks, Trump has already made plans to roll back some tariffs on metals, including on steel and aluminum goods, as he and his administration seek to battle an affordability crisis ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nThe US Supreme Court changed the US trade agenda on Friday, ruling that blanket tariffs are illegal and striking down President Trump's most sweeping tariffs.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision, the court held that the 1977 International Emergency Powers ACT (IEEPA) does not give Trump the authority to impose taxes without approval from Congress.\n\nThis ruling will mean that much of the administration's current tariff agenda will be brought to a halt, especially those tariffs first announced in April last year, on what has come to be known as Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.\n\nToday, economists at Penn-Wharton said that over $175 billion in tariff revenue may need to be refunded if the Supreme Court rules against Trump's tariffs.\n\nHowever, according to SCOTUSblog, the court mentioned nothing about whether the government should go about returning the billions of dollars it made from importers.\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas, Brett Kavanaugh, and Samuel Alito all dissented.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh, in his dissent, said, \"The United States may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers who paid the IEEPA tariffs, even though some importers may have already passed on costs to consumers or others.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court majority that struck down President Trump's ability to issue blanket tariffs on US trading partners did not address the issue of refunds — that is, will companies be able to get them for the duties they paid ... that are now ruled unconstitutional?\n\nThough the Supreme Court majority didn't address it, the dissenting minority did. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who authored the dissent, noted that the process could be a \"mess\" for the US Treasury to navigate.\n\nAfter the US Supreme Court struck down President Trump's tariffs, what are his options?\n\nTrump himself has said previously that the law he used to implement the tariffs is an essential tool in his toolbox. But other members of the administration have suggested that the White House could simply rebuild his tariff regime through other — albeit more cumbersome — methods.\n\nThe Associated Press has a good rundown of his options:\n\nThey run through them all here — read more.\n\nUS stocks rose in the immediate aftermath of the Supreme Court's decision to strike down President Trump's most sweeping tariffs. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led gains.\n\nSectors with more exposure to tariffs saw a bigger bounce. The Dow Jones Transportation Average (^DJT) popped around 1%. Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) saw outsize gains, as did Stanley Black & Decker (SWK).\n\nHead over to our markets blog for full coverage of the stock market's reaction to the ruling.\n\nNovartis (NVS) CEO Vas Narasimhan met with President Trump at the White House on Wednesday, where the president said the company is set to build 11 plants in the US.\n\nTrump hit Switzerland with 39% tariffs last year, but then agreed to cut the duties to 15% in November. Last month, Novartis said it expected to be protected from tariffs under some agreements with the US and strong domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe Trump administration is pushing back on claims from the New York Federal Reserve that US consumers and businesses are bearing the brunt of higher costs due to President Trump's tariffs.\n\n\"The paper is an embarrassment,\" National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think it's the worst paper I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nHowever, data from the JPMorgan Chase Institute, released Thursday, also found that tariffs paid by midsize US businesses tripled in 2025.\n\nYahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports on the latest news on Trump's tariffs:\n\nJapan plans to invest up to $36 billion in US oil, gas, and critical mineral projects, part of Tokyo's $550 billion commitment under the trade agreement it struck with President Trump last year.\n\n“Our MASSIVE Trade Deal with Japan has just launched!” Trump posted on Tuesday on social media. “The scale of these projects are so large, and could not be done without one very special word, TARIFFS.”\n\nJapan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said that the projects will help build more resilient supply chains through partnerships in crucial areas for economic security.\n\nThe Supreme Court has added next Friday, Feb. 20, as a decision day, the first time in weeks it could potentially issue a verdict on the closely watched case involving President Trump's tariffs.\n\nNext Friday is listed as a non-argument session and conference day on the high court's calendar.\n\nThe high court heard arguments on the tariff case in November on an expedited basis, and both liberal- and conservative-leaning justices asked skeptical questions about Trump's authority to impose the tariffs.\n\nThe duties at issue are Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, in which the president slapped levies ranging from 10% to 50% on imports from virtually all US trading partners. The Trump administration has said a defeat at the Supreme Court would only prompt it to impose the duties via other legal means — though Trump himself has said those processes would be more cumbersome and has implored the court to uphold the tariffs.\n\nOn Wednesday night, President Trump pressured House Republicans to support his tariffs, even though rising living costs have upset many voters.\n\nWhile six Republicans voted against his current tariffs on Canadian goods, 210 others remained loyal to Trump. But experts say this could harm them in the upcoming midterm elections, as many voters remain concerned about rising prices.\n\nA report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York argues that Americans are paying for almost all of the additional costs from President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nPresident Trump's tariffs faced a rebuke on Wednesday as the US House of Representatives voted to pass a resolution seeking to terminate the national emergency measures Trump used to impose tariffs on Canada. Six Republicans voted with Democrats to scrap Trump's tariffs against the US's neighbor.\n\nYahoo Finance's Washington Correspondent Ben Werschkul outlines the outcome of yesterday's vote by the US House of Representatives and what it means for Trump's tariffs:\n\nThe US and Japan are nearing the completion of the first of three projects that Tokyo agreed to fund as part of its $550 billion investment in the US and tariff agreement.\n\nBloomberg reports that the three projects include a data center led by SoftBank Group Corp. (9984.T), a deep-sea oil terminal in the Gulf of Mexico, and semiconductors.\n\nAccording to the report, SoftBank didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nConfusion over the trade deal between the US and India emerged on Wednesday after the White House adjusted language around agricultural goods.\n\nIn the updated statement, the US has removed a reference to pulses, a staple food in India that includes lentils and chickpeas.\n\nIn the old version, the statement says that India will remove tariffs on \"certain pulses\", whereas in the new version, the word \"pulses\" has been removed. The old version also says India is \"committed to buying more American products,\" whereas the new statement says \"... intends to buy...\"\n\nThe countries appear to have made other changes to the statement, too.\n\nThe US House of Representatives will vote on Wednesday on whether to reject some of President Trump's tariffs. The vote comes months ahead of the midterm elections, at a time when many Americans are concerned about the rising cost of living.\n\nToday's vote will start with a resolution to stop Trump's tariffs on Canada, which currently include a 35% tariff on imported items such as steel, aluminum, and copper, as well as a 25% duty on non-US cars. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the free trade agreement Trump has threatened to scrap, does exempt some of these goods.\n\nThe House vote will proceed despite Speaker Mike Johnson's attempt to block it.\n\nTrump has there would be no extra cost to the American people. A report from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation has found that these tariffs will amount to an average tax increase per US household of $1,000 in 2025 and $1,300 in 2026.\n\nThe Financial Times reports that the Trump administration is planning to exempt hyperscalers Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and Microsoft (MSFT) from forthcoming chip tariffs as Big Tech races to build data centers to power artificial intelligence.\n\nMexico is trying to send fuel to Cuba to prevent a power collapse, but it is searching for a way to do this without being hit by tariffs from the US.\n\nWashington has threatened tariffs on any country that attempts to help Cuba by supplying fuel.\n\nCuba has been under a 60-year embargo from the US dating back to the 1960s.\n\nEstee Lauder (EL) shares slumped 10% before the bell on Thursday, despite beating analysts' estimates on earnings per share and revenue, but tariff woes caused the beauty group's shares to tumble.\n\nThe Trump administration will be launching a $12 billion \"emergency warehouse\" for critical minerals needed to build cars, phones, and jets. The plan will include buying and storing these minerals now. The US hopes this will reduce its and other countries' reliance on China for supplies.\n\nThe critical mineral's stockpile news was released on Monday, and Vice President JD Vance plans to deliver a keynote speech on Wednesday at a meeting with the Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials from Europe, Asia, and Africa.\n\nThe Trump administration said on Tuesday that it plans to reduce India's tariffs on American industrial goods to zero from 13.5%, but will allow India to protect its farmers from foreign competition.\n\nThe US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer made the statement a day after President Trump agreed to reduce tariffs on New Delhi, claiming India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to stop purchasing Russian Oil.\n\nTrump hit India with 50% tariffs last year, 25% of which was a penalty for purchasing Russian oil, which Trump claimed was helping to fund the war in Ukraine.\n\nPresident Trump announced Monday that the \"reciprocal\" tariff rate on goods from India would drop to 18% from 25%, but that announcement underplayed the extent of the tariff reduction in evidence Monday in what the president described as a trade deal between the two nations.\n\nA White House official confirmed that, in addition to the reduction Trump outlined, the White House is also planning to drop a separate tariff of 25% on Indian goods over its Russian oil purchases, which previously amounted to a 50% tariff on Indian goods.\n\nThe new total tariff rate of 18% was what Prime Minister Narendra Modi quickly touted in his own social media post after the call with Trump, offering “Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India” but not outlining any of the changes on his end, which Trump listed.\n\nTrump said Monday that India had agreed to stop buying Russian oil and also reduce their tariffs and non-tariff barriers against the United States \"to ZERO.\"\n\nPresident Trump on Monday said the US and India had agreed to a trade deal after he spoke with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nTrump said the baseline US tariff rate on goods from India would drop to 18% from 25%. The US president also claimed that Modi had \"agreed to stop buying Russian Oil.\" India is also currently facing an additional 25% \"secondary\" tariff on its purchases of Russian oil.\n\n\"Our amazing relationship with India will be even stronger going forward,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nModi also agreed to buy American products \"at a much higher level,\" Trump said.\n\nThe apparent US deal with India comes as US trade partners are clinching long-negotiated deals in a rebuke to the Trump tariff regime. India and the EU announced a trade deal last week that the EU dubbed the \"mother of all deals,\" which came after years of negotiations between the two sides.\n\nPresident Trump is planning to launch a $12 billion minerals stockpile, according to Bloomberg News, in a bid to counter the US's reliance on China for rare earth materials.\n\nThe initiative has been dubbed Project Vault and will combine $1.67 billion in private capital with a $10 billion loan from the US Export-Import Bank. It is hoped that this venture will help acquire and store minerals for automakers, tech companies and other manufacturers.\n\nRare earth materials are key components used in a variety of products, such as smartphones, cars and rechargeable batteries. China has the largest reserve of rare earths and last year restricted exports of the materials due to Trump's tariffs. In November, China lifted the restrictions as part of a one-year trade truce with the US.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that her country will look for alternate ways to help Cuba, including \"diplomatic\" solutions after President Trump signed an order to levy tariffs on countries that supply Cuba with oil, Reuters reported. Mexico is one of the last nations that supplies Cuba with oil.\n\nThe US trade deficit — the value of imports minus the value of exports — swung wider in November as trade continued to shift in response to the Trump administration's tariff policies.\n\nPresident Trump's global tariffs have failed to stop Toyota Motors (TM), the Japanese car company said on Thursday that it had sold a record 11.3 million vehicles globally in 2025.\n\nToyota Motors will retain its position as the world's top-selling automaker in 2025, and its recent sales growth has come despite Trump's aggressive tariff policies.\n\nTrump initially imposed 25% tariffs on Japanese automakers but reduced them to 15% after reaching a deal with Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.\n\nThe stock rose 2% during early trading on Thursday.",

    "fullText": "Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch is having an ‘I told you so’ moment when it comes to President Trump’s tariffs.\n\nAt November’s blockbuster arguments, Gorsuch raised alarm about what he called a “one-way ratchet” of authority from Congress to the president if Trump wins a case that challenges his use of emergency powers to impose duties on a host of countries.\n\n“It’s going to be veto-proof,” Gorsuch warned of Trump’s declared emergencies.\n\n“What president’s ever going to give that power back? A pretty rare president. So how should that inform our view?”\n\nGorsuch’s concern is now in the limelight as the justices prepare to return to the bench to issue opinions on three separate days between now and next Wednesday.\n\nLast week, Trump saw one of the first major pushbacks from Congress on the matter, when six House Republicans joined Democrats in voting 219-211 to repeal Trump’s Canada tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). That measure now heads to the Senate, where four Republicans joined Democrats last year on a similar effort. The new vote only needs a simple majority.\n\nBut even if it gets to Trump’s desk, the revolt is largely symbolic. The bipartisan support for repealing the tariffs falls far short of the two-thirds majority needed in both the House and Senate to override an expected veto.\n\nGorsuch saw it coming — and he wasn’t the only Trump-nominated justice to read the tea leaves back at November’s arguments.\n\n“Let’s say that we adopt your interpretation of the statute,” Justice Amy Coney Barrett told the government. “If Congress said, ‘Whoa, we don’t like that, that gives a president too much authority under IEEPA,’ it’s going to have a very hard time pulling the tariff power out of IEEPA, correct?”\n\nCongress can amend IEEPA at any time to make clear whether the 1977 law does, or does not, authorize Trump’s tariffs. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has expressed no appetite for doing so, leaving the nine justices to parse the nearly half-century-old phrasing that has left global financial markets in suspense for months.\n\n“I think the sentiment is that we allow a little bit more runway for this to be worked out between the executive branch and the judicial branch,” Johnson said last week.\n\nNo one outside the court knows if the tariffs’ opinion is being sent to the printers right now, or if there’s still time for tweaks. When it is released, watch to see if any of the justices take note of the recent developments on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe Trump administration hopes to convince the justices that Congress can, indeed, claw back power from the president. Solicitor General D. John Sauer would like everyone to remember that Congress clubbed together the votes to terminate the massive COVID-19 emergency just a few years ago.\n\n“What the statute reflects is there’s going to be the ability for a sort of political consensus against a declared emergency. Nevertheless, that’s a political discipline,” Sauer said during the tariff arguments.\n\nSpeculation is still running rampant about exactly when the Supreme Court will release the highly anticipated decision. Some 105 days have now passed since oral arguments, longer than other recent expedited cases.\n\nWhen asked about the wait during her book promo on “CBS Mornings” last week, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson didn’t think much of it.  There are “lots of nuanced legal issues” and “it takes a while to write,” she said.\n\n“The court is going through its process of deliberation, and the American people expect for us to be thorough and clear in our determinations, and sometimes that takes time,” Jackson said.\n\nThe fact the junior liberal justice said anything at all was notable, as Supreme Court justices typically steer clear of talking about pending cases. Full stop.\n\nWe’ve got our ears perked up. As the justices return to the bench, the court has signaled it will hand down opinions Friday, Tuesday and next Wednesday.\n\nBettors on prediction markets think it could be coming. After the court scheduled the opinion days, the odds of the tariff decision landing this month jumped from 40 percent to more than 70 percent on Kalshi, a popular prediction market.\n\nSandwiched between two of the opinion day releases is the State of the Union, scheduled for Tuesday evening.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts and several of the other justices typically attend; here’s the list of who has shown up each year. It’s a rare face-to-face moment between the justices and the president, with every move scrutinized.\n\nAs Roberts and the others sat in last year for Trump’s address, they were also sitting on the president’s emergency appeal seeking to freeze foreign aid. The justices released the decision — against Trump — at 8:59 a.m. the next morning.\n\nWelcome to The Gavel, The Hill’s weekly courts newsletter from Ella Lee and Zach Schonfeld. Reach out to us on X (@ByEllaLee, @ZachASchonfeld) or Signal (elee.03, zachschonfeld.48). \n\nJudges get new leeway to defend the courts\n\nFederal judges have been granted new wiggle room to speak out about the importance of the judiciary as threats and attacks on the courts surge.\n\nAn advisory opinion from the Judicial Conference’s Committee on Codes of Conduct affirmed that the ethics code abided by judges allows them to advocate for the rule of law and defend the independence of the courts, including to seek increased judicial security and funding.\n\nThe opinion goes further to say that, in some circumstances, judges may stand up for their peers against unjust attacks.\n\n“Although this Commentary addresses persecution specifically, the Committee believes the Code and its previous advisory opinions leave room, in at least some circumstances, for the measured defense of judicial colleagues from illegitimate forms of criticism and attacks that risk undermining judicial independence or the rule of law, whether or not they rise to the level of persecution,” the opinion reads.\n\nIt makes no reference to any specific assault on the judiciary. But it follows years of tongue-lashing and impeachment threats from Trump and his allies, especially toward judges who rule against the president. At the same time, public trust in the courts has fallen to near-record lows.\n\nIt points to Roberts’s 2024 year-end report as a guidepost, which addressed four detriments to judicial independence: violence, intimidation, disinformation and threats to defy lawfully entered judgments. Roberts has pushed back on Trump’s threats, though he’s also at turns spoken out about Democrats’ rhetoric.\n\nJudges should avoid acting in a manner that detracts from their official duties and impartiality of the court, commenting on the merits of active matters or engaging in certain political activities, the opinion says.\n\nThey also must watch their tone in writing outside the courtroom, avoiding “sensationalism,” and consider where they choose to speak, so as not to create questions about their fairness.\n\n“These general cautions in the Code do not lend themselves well to precise definitions,” the opinion notes, “and even seemingly clear limits permit a variety of exceptions.”\n\nGabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, called the opinion a “a strong step forward for ethics and for judicial independence,” suggesting it showed the committee pushing back on Trump.\n\n“Though individuals are not called out by name, this is a strong rebuke of the Trump administration’s ‘war’ on the judiciary and comes one day after Attorney General [Pam] Bondi denounced ‘liberal activist judges’ for taking part in ‘coordinated […] unlawful attack’ against President Trump’s ‘authority,’” he said in a statement Thursday. “Any judge who, in a measured manner, seeks to counter that nonsense would thus be ethically sound.”\n\nAs attacks on the judiciary have escalated, some judges have spoken out anonymously in the press, or in rarer instances, publicly. It’s especially prevalent as threats against judges continue to rise.\n\nIn fiscal 2025, there were 564 threats against judges, according to U.S. Marshals Service data. Since fiscal 2026 began in October, there have already been 176 threats.\n\nWhat to know about the Supreme Court’s new recusal software\n\nMore ethics news landed Tuesday, this time from the Supreme Court.\n\nStarting in March, the justices will use new software to help identify when they should recuse from a case.\n\nIt’s the justices’ latest effort to align themselves with lower federal judges, who have been required to use an automated conflict-screening system for the past two decades.\n\nThe Supreme Court is not bound by lower judges’ code of conduct.\n\nIt has left the justices playing catch up as public scrutiny into their ethics sharpens, spurred by investigations into the justices’ book deals and luxury trips paid for by billionaires.\n\nTwo years ago, the justices responded to mounting pressure by agreeing to a statement of ethical principles.\n\nCritics emphasize it has no enforcement mechanism. It did, however, direct that the court consider adding a new screening software.\n\nTo be clear, the justices have long identified conflicts. Last term, the justices recused more than 80 times in total, according to The Gavel’s docket tracker. And since this term began in October, the recusal count has already surpassed 30.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito is by far the leader, a reflection of his decision to own direct stock holdings in more than two dozen companies. Alito this term has recused more than twice as many times as any of his colleagues.\n\nStill, catching all necessary recusals is a tall task. The court received nearly 4,000 petitions to take up cases last term, many of which involve a complicated web of companies.\n\nJust last month, Alito recused from a battle between Louisiana parishes and major oil companies at the eleventh hour before the arguments. Alito owns stock in ConocoPhillips, which owns a company named in the suit, but that company had insisted it was no longer involved in the case. It turned out not to be true.\n\nAnd in 2024, Gorsuch belatedly stepped aside from another environmental case after pressure from Democrats over his ties to a billionaire that had filed a brief.\n\nRoth, Fix The Court’s executive director, said the more effective change would’ve been for Alito to divest all direct stock holdings. Every other justice does so except for Roberts.\n\n“So although the new rule is a net positive since it comes in service of the full Court’s adoption of conflict-check software, it’s not a major improvement, and it should not have taken 827 days post-Code to implement,” Roth said in a statement.\n\n“That’s especially true since lower court judges have been required to use software-based conflict screening for 20 years, and several justices have been rumored to continue to use it after they were elevated,” he continued.\n\nThe Supreme Court has not publicly demoed its new software. If you’ve seen it, drop us a line.\n\nWhen it launches, litigants must send a list of the stock tickers for companies involved in their case so it can be run through the screening.\n\nKelly’s court win: A federal judge blocked the Pentagon’s efforts to censure Sen. Mark Kelly and lower his retirement rank in the wake of a video in which the senator and other fellow Democrats called on service members to reject unlawful orders.\n\nNY redistricting reaches SCOTUS: Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.) urged the Supreme Court to stop her state judiciary from ordering a redraw of her congressional district ahead of the midterms, casting it as unconstitutional.\n\nMN evidence fight: The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) said it was formally notified by the FBI that the bureau will not share any information about its investigation into the death of Alex Pretti.\n\nGateway Tunnel fight: A federal appeals court allowed a judge’s order requiring the Trump administration to resume funding for the Gateway tunnel project connecting New York and New Jersey to take effect.\n\nBenghazi attack prosecution: A man facing federal charges in connection with the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans pleaded not guilty.\n\nSwift resolution: Taylor Swift filed legal action to block a bedding company from getting a trademark on a logo that says, “Swift Home.” The company soon after withdrew its application. Read the BBC’s report on the dustup.\n\n‘Straight to the source’: As the Supreme Court mulls its tariff decision, Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) visited the National Archives to lay eyes on the constitutional ink that gives Congress the power to collect taxes and duties. “Went straight to the source. The Constitution is clear,” Bacon wrote on social media. The archives staff has a strict prohibition on taking photos of the Constitution, so add that to the list of special privileges you get as a member of Congress.\n\nMr. Wonderful wins defamation suit: A federal judge awarded “Shark Tank” investor Kevin O’Leary $2.83 million in his defamation lawsuit against Ben Armstrong, a famous cryptocurrency influencer known as “BitBoy Crypto.” Armstrong called O’Leary a murderer over a 2019 fatal accident involving his boat, which his wife was driving. She was later cleared of wrongdoing. The judge entered default judgment after Armstrong failed to meet court deadlines.\n\nPetitions to take up cases that the justices are keeping a close eye on.\n\nHere’s a look at four major legal battles that reach the Supreme Court this week. At their closed-door conference Friday, the justices will consider taking them up for next term.\n\nNot all the cases are likely to be granted, but they each are legal battles that have played prominently for years:\n\nTrump’s E. Jean Carroll verdict: President Trump seeks review of the jury’s verdict that found him liable for sexually assaulting writer E. Jean Carroll in the mid-1990s, which Trump denies, and ordered him to pay $5 million. The president says the jury shouldn’t have heard the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape or testimony from other women who have accused Trump of misconduct. He also argues he should’ve been allowed to tell jurors that a Democratic mega-donor was paying Carroll’s legal bills. The case is Trump v. Carroll.\n\nMore guns: For weeks, the court has stalled announcing whether it will hear Second Amendment challenges against AR-15 and high-capacity magazine bans as well as the federal felon-in-possession law. The pileup grows this week. In Fooks v. Maryland and Mancuso v. New York, the court is asked to hear challenges to state felon-in-possession laws. And in National Association for Gun Rights v. Lamont and Grant v. Higgins, it is also being petitioned to hear a challenge to Connecticut’s AR-15 ban.\n\nNRA’s free speech fight: The National Rifle Association (NRA) is at the high court, but not on the Second Amendment. It’s about the First Amendment. In 2024, the justices unanimously ruled the gun rights group can proceed in its free speech fight against a New York regulator. When the case returned to a lower court, it again sided with the regulator. So, the NRA is back. The case is NRA v. Vullo.\n\nFor-profit college settlement: Everglades College wants the Supreme Court to revive its fight against a class action settlement the Biden administration approved, which cancels $7.5 billion in student debt for those who alleged fraud by for-profit colleges. Lower courts ruled the college had no legal standing, meaning no right to sue over the settlement. The case is Everglades College v. McMahon.\n\nDon’t be surprised if additional hearings are scheduled throughout the week. But here’s what we’re watching for now:\n\nMark Zuckerberg is expected to testify in a landmark social media addiction trial in Los Angeles.\n\nNew York’s elections board is due to respond in writing to Rep. Nicole Malliotakis’s (R-N.Y.) Supreme Court emergency application seeking to revive her congressional district.\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to announce opinions.\n\nA federal magistrate judge in Virginia will hold a hearing to weigh Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson’s bid for the return of her devices that were seized in an FBI search of her home.\n\nA federal judge in Minnesota is set to hold a status conference in the criminal case of Vance Boelter, the man accused of shooting two state lawmakers and their spouses, killing one of the couples.\n\nThe Supreme Court will announce orders.\n\nThe justices will also hear oral arguments in two cases involving Cuba, over whether the Helms-Burton Act enables Havana Docks to seek compensation from major cruise lines that docked at Havana’s port and whether lawsuits filed under the statute also clear the normal immunity rules for hauling a foreign government into court.\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to announce opinions.\n\nThe justices will also hear oral arguments over whether judges have authority to excuse the 30-day time limit for defendants to remove a state lawsuit to federal court in exceptional circumstances.\n\nThe full U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is set to hear oral arguments over the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nThe full D.C. Circuit is also set to hear oral arguments in the Trump administration’s appeal of an order blocking the Environmental Protection Agency from clawing back billions of dollars in climate spending.\n\nRachel Weiner in Court Watch: The Rabbit Hole: Covering the Courts from a Windowless Office\n\nThe Washington Post’s Peter Whoriskey: Killers without a cause: The rise in nihilistic violent extremism\n\nGreen Matters’s Shreya Patnaik: The Colorado River Now Holds Legal Personhood.

    "fullText": "New Jersey's acting attorney general said Tuesday she will not ask the state Supreme Court to review the dismissal of racketeering charges against Democratic power broker George E. Norcross III and those charged alongside him.\n\nThe decision by Jennifer Davenport, who was recently appointed by new Gov. Mikie Sherrill, came nearly three weeks after a three-judge appellate panel upheld a state judge's decision to toss the criminal charges. The indictment had been obtained by Matt Platkin, who served as attorney general under Sherrill's predecessor and fellow Democrat Phil Murphy.\n\n“In light of the Appellate Division’s decision, we have concluded that our prosecutorial resources would be best spent on other matters,\" the attorney general's office said in a statement. “Our office remains committed to prioritizing public corruption prosecutions in this time of deepening mistrust in government.”\n\nThe charges stemmed from a June 2024 indictment announced by Platkin at a news conference at which Norcross himself took the unusual step of appearing in person and sitting directly in front of the attorney general.\n\nNorcross and five other defendants were accused of running “an enterprise” going back to 2012 to use their political influence to craft legislation to serve their own interests. But in a nearly 100-page ruling, the state judge found the prosecution’s allegations did not amount to criminal coercion or extortion and are time-barred.\n\nNorcross and his lawyers have long maintained his innocence, claiming the indictment was politically motivated, an allegation Platkin has repeatedly denied.\n\nNorcross, who served as executive chairman of the insurance firm Conner Strong & Buckelew, has been widely viewed as among the most influential unelected Democrats in the state. He was a Democratic National Committee member until 2021 and previously served as the head of the Camden County Democratic Party.",

    "description": "From Costco to Toyota, global companies are filing lawsuits to secure tariff refunds should the Supreme Court decide to strike down Trump's duties.",
    "fullText": "Top global companies want their money back from the Trump administration.\n\nThe Supreme Court is in the process of deciding whether Trump's tariffs enacted under an emergency law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, are legal. To companies that may have already paid billions in duties over the past year, a ruling against tariffs may not be enough to recoup funds.\n\nSmall businesses mainly spearheaded the initial wave of lawsuits against tariffs, but some of the largest global corporations are now filing lawsuits in fear that they may not be refunded should the Supreme Court overturn the duties.\n\nTypically, duties paid to the Customs and Border Protection undergo a process called liquidation within a year of the entry of the goods in question. Once liquidation occurs, the chances of getting any money back become slim — and for many companies, their time is running out.\n\nFrom Costco to Toyota, here are some of the largest global companies that want their tariffs refunded.\n\nCostco is seeking a \"full refund\" of tariffs it paid under the IEEPA, arguing the levies were imposed illegally and could soon become unrecoverable.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed with the Court of International Trade in December 2025, Costco's lawyers argued that the law, first enacted in 1977, has never authorized tariffs.\n\n\"The text of IEEPA does not use the word 'tariff' or any term of equivalent meaning,\" the company wrote.\n\nThe company also said in the complaint that it filed its own suit because even if the Supreme Court ultimately rules the tariffs unlawful, importers are not guaranteed refunds without separate court judgments. Costco said that its imports could begin entering \"liquidation\" as early as mid-December, which is a customs process that could permanently close the door on refunds. Customs has already declined to extend that timeline, Costco said in the suit.\n\nCostco did not disclose how much it has paid in duties.\n\nSubsidiaries of the Toyota Group, Toyota Tsusho America, Toyota Tsusho Canada, and Toyota Tsusho Nexty Electronics America filed a lawsuit in November 2025 to secure refunds.\n\n\"And this action is necessary now because the entries for which Plaintiffs paid tariffs imposed under authority of IEEPA will begin to become liquidated and final as a matter of law by January 31, 2026,\" the companies wrote in the complaint.\n\n\"Plaintiffs seek relief from the impending final liquidations to ensure that their right to a complete refund is not jeopardized,\" they added.\n\nThe auto sector has been among the industries most exposed to Trump's tariffs, which added duties on vehicles as well as on steel and aluminum. In May 2025, Toyota said that the higher import and export rates could cost the company about $1.3 billion over a two-month period.\n\nBYD's lawsuit marks the first from a Chinese carmaker against Trump's tariffs.\n\nThe EV giant filed the suit on February 9 and detailed nine executive orders related to trade that affected the company, including tariffs on cars, auto parts, aluminum, steel, and exports from China.\n\nIn the complaint, BYD wrote that it is seeking a refund of \"all IEEPA tariffs paid to date\" and \"all IEEPA tariffs that may be paid in the future.\"\n\nThe company also said that aside from China, its imports into the US from Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Poland were also affected.\n\nThe Chinese carmaker does not sell passenger cars in the US, but its business here includes buses, commercial vehicles, batteries, energy storage systems, and solar panels. According to its website, the company's truck plant in Lancaster, California, employs 750 workers.\n\nOn December 10, 2025, Goodyear Tire & Rubber filed its complaint and request for relief, and detailed how tariffs, especially the ones imposed on China, which changed nearly a dozen times, affected the company.\n\n\"Where CBP acts in a ministerial capacity (i.e., without discretion) in imposing a duty, the entry's liquidation cannot be protested,\" wrote Goodyear in its complaint as to why the company is asking the court to block liquidation.\n\nGoodyear sources a significant portion of its raw materials from Southeast Asia, where the rubber plant is widely commercially grown. According to Goodyear's website, the company's manufacturing facilities are located across 23 countries, including China, the US, Germany, Poland, and Thailand.\n\nAlcoa Corp, one of the world's top producers of aluminum, bauxite, and alumina, filed a complaint for tariff refunds on November 26, 2025.\n\nThis case is one of several dozen that were consolidated with AGS Company Automotive Solutions v. United States Customs and Border Protection, which became the lead case regarding IEEPA duty liquidation as of December 2025.\n\nAs of June 2025, tariffs on most steel and aluminum imports increased to 50%.",

    "description": "The Virginia Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a U.S. Marine and his wife will keep an Afghan orphan they brought home in defiance of a U.S. government decision to reunite her with her Afghan family.",
    "fullText": "The Virginia Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a U.S. Marine and his wife will keep an Afghan orphan they brought home in defiance of a U.S. government decision to reunite her with her Afghan family. The decision likely ends a bitter, yearslong legal battle over the girl's fate.\n\nIn 2020, a judge in Fluvanna County, Virginia, granted Joshua and Stephanie Mast an adoption of the child, who was then 7,000 miles away in Afghanistan living with a family the Afghan government decided were her relatives.\n\nFour justices on the Virginia Supreme Court on Thursday signed onto an opinion reversing two lower courts’ rulings that found the adoption was so flawed it was void from the moment it was issued.\n\nThe justices wrote that a Virginia law that cements adoption orders after six months bars the child’s Afghan relatives from challenging the court, no matter how flawed its orders and even if the adoption was obtained by fraud.\n\nThree justices issued a scathing dissent, calling what happened in this court “wrong,” “cancerous” and “like a house built on a rotten foundation.”\n\nAn attorney for the Masts declined to comment, citing an order from the circuit court not to discuss the details of the case publicly. Lawyers representing the Afghan family said they were not yet prepared to comment.\n\nThe child was injured on the battlefield in Afghanistan in September 2019 when U.S. soldiers raided a rural compound. The child’s parents and siblings were killed. Soldiers brought her to a hospital at an American military base.\n\nThe raid was targeting terrorists who had come into Afghanistan from a neighboring country; some believed she was not Afghan and tried to make a case for bringing her to the U.S. But the State Department, under President Donald Trump’s first administration, insisted the U.S. was obligated under international law to work with the Afghan government and the International Committee of the Red Cross to unite the child with her closest surviving relatives.\n\nThe Afghan government determined she was Afghan and vetted a man who claimed to be her uncle. The U.S. government agreed and brought her to the family. The uncle chose to give her to his son and his new wife, who raised her for 18 months in Afghanistan.\n\nMeanwhile, Mast and his wife convinced courts in rural Fluvanna County, Virginia, to grant them custody and then a series of adoption orders, continuing to claim she was the “stateless” daughter of foreign fighters.\n\nJudge Richard Moore granted them a final adoption in December 2020. When the six-month statute of limitations ran out, the child was still in Afghanistan living with her relatives, who testified they had no idea a judge was giving the girl to another family. Mast contacted them through intermediaries and tried to get them to send the girl to the U.S. for medical treatment but they refused to let her go alone.\n\nWhen the U.S. military withdrew from Afghanistan and the Taliban took over, the family agreed to leave and Mast worked his military contacts to get them on an evacuation flight. Mast then took the baby from them at a refugee resettlement center in Virginia, and they haven’t seen her since.\n\nThe AP agreed not to name the Afghan couple because they fear their families in Afghanistan might face retaliation from the Taliban. The circuit court issued a protective order shielding their identities.\n\nThe Afghans challenged the adoption, claiming the court had no authority over a foreign child and the adoption orders were based on Mast repeatedly misleading the judge.\n\nThe Virginia Supreme Court on Thursday wrote that the law prohibiting challenges to an adoption after six months is designed to create permanency, so a child is not bounced from one home to another. The only way to undercut it is to argue that a parent’s constitutional rights were violated.\n\nThe lower courts had found that the Afghan couple had a right to challenge the adoption because they were the girl’s “de facto” parents when they came to the United States.\n\nFour of the Supreme Court judges — D. Arthur Kelsey, Stephen R. McCullough, Teresa M. Chafin, Wesley G. Russell Jr. — disagreed.\n\n“We find no legal merit” in the argument that “that they were ‘de facto’ parents of the child and that no American court could constitutionally sever that relationship,” they wrote. They pointed to Fluvanna County Circuit Court Judge Richard Moore’s findings that the Afghan couple “are not and never were parents” of the child, because they had no order from an Afghan court and had not proven any biological relationship to her.\n\nThe Afghans had refused DNA testing, saying it could not reliably prove a familial connection between opposite-gender half-cousins. They insisted that it didn't matter, because Afghanistan claimed the girl as its citizen and got to determine her next-of-kin.\n\nThe Supreme Court leaned heavily on a 38-page document written by Judge Moore, who granted the adoption, then presided over a dozen hearings after the Afghans challenged it. He wrote that he trusted the Masts more than the Afghans, and believed that the Masts’ motivations were noble while the Afghans were misrepresenting their relationship to the child.\n\nThe Supreme Court also dismissed the federal government’s long insistence that Trump’s first administration had made a foreign policy decision to unite her with her Afghan relatives, and a court in Virginia has no authority to undo it. The government submitted filings in court predicting dire outcomes if the baby was allowed to remain with the Marine: it could be viewed as “endorsing an act of international child abduction,” threaten international security pacts and be used as propaganda by Islamic extremists — potentially endangering U.S soldiers overseas.\n\nBut the Justice Department in Trump’s second administration abruptly changed course.\n\nThe Supreme Court noted in its opinion that the Justice Department had been granted permission to make arguments in the case, but withdrew its request to do so on the morning of oral arguments last year, saying it “has now had an opportunity to reevaluate its position in this case.”\n\nThe Supreme Court returned repeatedly to Moore’s finding that giving the girl to the family “was not a decision the United States initiated, but rather consented to or acquiesced in.”\n\nThe three judges who dissented were unsparing in their criticism of both the Masts and the circuit court that granted him the adoption.\n\n“A dispassionate review of this case reveals a scenario suffused with arrogance and privilege. Worse, it appears to have worked,” begins the dissent, written by Justice Thomas P. Mann, and signed by Chief Justice Cleo E. Powell and LeRoy F. Millette, Jr.\n\nA Virginia court never had the right to give the child to the Masts, the dissent said.\n\nThey castigated the Masts for “brazenly” misleading the courts during their quest to adopt the girl.\n\n“We must recognize what an adoption really is: the severance and termination of the rights naturally flowing to an otherwise legitimate claimant to parental authority. Of course, the process must be impeccable. An evolved society could not sanction anything less than that. And here, it was less,” Mann wrote. “If this process was represented by a straight line, (the Masts) went above it, under it, around it, and then blasted right through it until there was no line at all — just fragments collapsing into a cavity.”",

    "fullText": "Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito has offered a cryptic observation about his former colleague and mentor, the late conservative justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nScalia, who was appointed to the bench in 1986 and became one of its most influential conservative members, died unexpectedly in his sleep at age 79, in early 2016.\n\nAfter his death, Alito—who has served on the Supreme Court since 2006—continued Scalia’s judicial legacy by authoring the Dobbs v. Jackson decision overturning the constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nHis decision drew heavily from dissents that Scalia had authored in previous cases upholding the right to an abortion, Alito told journalist and author James Rosen in a new interview published in Politico.\n\nBut while Scalia would have no doubt been happy that the court now boasts an entrenched 6-3 conservative majority, he would have been less enthusiastic about the state of American politics, which have grown “coarser and more polarized than ever before,” Rosen wrote.\n\n“He would have been appalled at so much,” Alito told Rosen.\n\nThe 75-year-old did not elaborate, though he apparently agreed with one of Scalia’s children that the timing of the justice’s death meant he was spared from witnessing “so much that would have upset him,” as Rosen put it.\n\nA few months after Scalia died, President Donald Trump was named the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\nTrump went on to win the general election in November and appoint Scalia’s successor, Neil Gorsuch, after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell kept the seat vacant for more than a year in order to prevent President Barack Obama from filling it.\n\nSince then, the court has been rocked by a series of scandals, including Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s disastrous confirmation hearings in 2018, during which Christine Blasey Ford accused him of sexual assault, which he denied.\n\nA few years later, in 2022, a draft version of Alito’s decision in Dobbs was leaked to Politico. If the leak came up during Rosen’s 90-minute interview with Alito, the author didn’t mention it.\n\nSubsequent leaks have revealed disagreements among the justices, including a bitter debate over the court’s toothless ethics rules, and a confidential memo in which Chief Justice John Roberts pushed to grant Trump broad immunity from prosecution.\n\nThe court is also facing record-low public trust as Alito and the other conservative justices have greenlit the vast majority of Trump’s policies, while the justices themselves face unprecedented security risks.\n\n“Even since Nino died, things are so different,” Alito told Rosen, using a nickname for Scalia reserved for close friends and family. “I so often wish he were still here. He started so much and it would have been good to have him around to see it to completion.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the Supreme Court for comment.",

    "title": "Why a Republican Supreme Court just handed a victory to Democrats",
    "description": "The short answer is that this Supreme Court loves gerrymandering more than it hates Democrats.",
    "fullText": "On Wednesday, the Supreme Court handed down a one-sentence order announcing that California’s newly gerrymandered maps, which are expected to give Democrats as many as five more seats in the US House, may go into effect during the 2026 midterms. These maps were enacted to counterbalance a Republican gerrymander in Texas, which could also give Republicans as many as five House seats.\n\nIf you believe that the Supreme Court applies consistent legal rules, regardless of who benefits from them, then Wednesday’s order in Tangipa v. Newsom is completely unsurprising. In January, the Court handed down a different order blessing Texas’s Republican gerrymander. That decision, in a case called Abbott v. LULAC, didn’t just permit Texas’s maps to take effect; it also imposed new, extraordinarily high barriers in front of any plaintiff challenging a legislative map.\n\nSo, if the Court had struck down California’s maps after issuing such a broad decision in the Texas case, the only plausible explanation would have been partisanship.\n\nBut the Supreme Court’s Republican majority has also spent the past several years validating all the worst fears of the Court’s most cynical critics. This is, after all, the same Court that held that Donald Trump is allowed to use the powers of the presidency to commit crimes. And it’s the same Court that spent 2025 removing legal barriers to Trump’s mass deportations and mass firings of civil servants.\n\nThe Republican justices, moreover, routinely bend the rules when they feel strongly about the politics of a particular case. In Whole Woman’s Health v. Jackson (2021), a decision shielding an anti-abortion law from judicial review, five of the Court’s Republicans handed down a legal rule that, if applied in cases that don’t involve abortion, would allow any state to eliminate any constitutional right. In Kennedy v. Bremerton School District (2022), the Republican justices made up fake facts to justify ruling in favor of a conservative Christian litigant — and then stuck to their made-up narrative even after Justice Sonia Sotomayor produced photographic evidence that they were lying.\n\nThe truth is that neither the Court’s most earnest defenders — who believe that every Supreme Court decision is rooted in a good faith effort to apply the law to the facts of a particular case — nor the Court’s most bitter cynics paint a fully accurate picture of how this Court operates. The justices consider a wide range of factors when they decide a case, including what outcome they would prefer, which party they are more sympathetic toward, which outcome their political party prefers, what outcome is dictated by their own previous opinions, and what the law actually says.\n\nIn some cases, especially cases that involve technocratic issues that are not politically controversial, all nine justices typically decide their case based solely on what the law says. In cases involving particularly contentious issues, such as abortion, the Court often decides the case based solely on the justices personal preferences. Many cases exist on a spectrum between these two extremes.\n\nAdditionally, there are some cases, such as Tangipa, where many of the justices’ broader ideological commitments cut against the outcome they would prefer. It’s safe to say that all six of the justices who held that Trump is allowed to commit crimes would also like Republicans to control the House of Representatives. But these justices have also staked out a strong ideological position against all gerrymandering suits, and that ideological view appears to have triumphed over their narrow partisan interests in Tangipa.\n\nThis is normal behavior by partisan public officials. Members of Congress also sometimes cast votes that cut against their political party’s immediate interests, but that are rooted in a broader ideology. All lawmakers balance their own personal preferences against the interest of their party, the interests of their constituents, and the politics of the moment.\n\nFor much of 2020, the global economy was in a deep recession triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdowns. It was also a presidential election year, and Republicans were in a bind. Trump was in the White House, and incumbent parties typically lose big when they have to campaign during a recession. Just ask John McCain.\n\nIn the midst of this economic crisis, congressional Democrats behaved completely irrationally from the perspective of a party determined to maximize its electoral gains. Then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi did not simply work with the Trump administration to craft stimulus bills that would lift many Americans from the depths of the Covid recession. She attacked her Republican counterparts for not doing more to stimulate the economy. When Republicans announced a “skinny” stimulus package in the fall of 2020, Pelosi and then-Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer denounced it as an “emaciated bill” pushed by an “extreme right-wing that doesn’t want to spend a nickel to help people.”\n\nThough Tangipa v. Newsom is a short-term loss for the Republican Party, it is consistent with the GOP’s longstanding views on gerrymandering.\n\nThe reason why is that Democrats generally, and Pelosi in particular, have a longstanding ideological commitment to Keynesian economics — which teaches that the government should spend more during economic downturns. This commitment stretches back to the New Deal, President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s successful plan to lift the nation out of the Great Depression. Pelosi, who was speaker during the 2008–’09 recession, also helped push big spending bills through Congress to address that recession.\n\nIf Pelosi had been a more ruthless partisan, she might have sabotaged any proposal to stimulate the economy, with the expectation that Trump would bear the blame for his inability to get a bill through Congress. She may even have made unreasonable demands, hoping that the White House would refuse them and get tarred as misers. Instead, Pelosi’s Democrats worked with Republicans to pass trillions in economic stimulus.\n\nMeanwhile, many congressional Republicans are currently pushing legislation that would likely diminish their chances of winning future elections, because of a broader ideological commitment to more restrictive voting laws.\n\nLast April, the US House passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act (“SAVE Act”), which prevents Americans from registering to vote unless they produce “documentary proof of United States citizenship” such as a passport. Every House Republican who cast a vote supported the law, while all but four Democrats opposed it. In response to a recent push by Republicans to pass the bill in the Senate, Schumer accused Republicans of wanting to “restore Jim Crow.”\n\nBut both parties are probably behaving irrationally, at least from the perspective of cynical electoral politics. Republicans formed an ideological commitment to restrictive voting legislation decades ago, when low-propensity voters were more likely to support Democrats than Republicans. Democratic President Barack Obama, for example, won both of his presidential elections by comfortable margins, but Democrats struggled in lower-turnout midterms during the Obama administration.\n\nIndeed, during Obama’s presidency, Republicans sometimes spoke openly about their belief that they could skew elections by making it slightly more difficult to vote. In 2012, for example, Pennsylvania’s House Republican leader Mike Turzai claimed that a state law requiring voters to show ID at the polls is “gonna allow [Republican presidential candidate Mitt] Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania.”\n\nUnder Trump, however, this dynamic has reversed. Low-propensity voters now prefer Republicans, while the kind of highly engaged suburban voters who favored Romney in 2012 have trended toward Democrats. So it is far from clear that voting restrictions that Republicans embraced years ago would actually help them today. If anything, legislation like the SAVE Act might help Democrats win elections.\n\nIn any event, it’s hardly surprising to say that political parties hold consistent ideological positions even when those positions cut against their short-term interests. The parties typically hew to a few core positions even when it costs them at the polls. For instance, anyone who has paid attention to US politics knows that a vote for a Republican member of Congress is a vote for upper-income tax cuts and deep cuts to anti-poverty programs such as Medicaid. A vote for a Democratic candidate is typically a vote for the opposite. And this has been true for many years.\n\nBoth Obamacare and the 2017 Trump tax cuts were unpopular when they became law, and each party knew that the efforts could hurt them in the 2010 and 2018 midterms. But Democrats enacted health reform and Republicans enacted their tax cuts regardless, because of deep ideological commitments to these projects.\n\nSimilarly, Supreme Court justices also have predictable views that can be determined solely by looking at which president appointed them. Republican justices oppose abortion and affirmative action, and support broad legal immunity for religious conservatives, among other things. Democratic justices support the opposite outcomes. And justices of both parties tend to stick to these views regardless of how they poll at any particular time.\n\nNow let’s return to the Tangipa case, where a GOP-controlled Supreme Court voted in favor of a Democratic gerrymander. This decision closely resembles Pelosi’s support for economic stimulus in 2020, or Republicans’ continuing commitment to voting restrictions that are likely to impact their own voters. Though Tangipa is a short-term loss for the Republican Party, it is consistent with the GOP’s longstanding views on gerrymandering.\n\nThe Supreme Court used to permit federal courts to hear lawsuits alleging that a legislative map drawn to benefit one party or the other violates the Constitution. But the Court’s Republican majority shut these lawsuits down in Rucho v. Common Cause (2019). Five years later, in Alexander v. South Carolina NAACP (2024), the Republican justices went a step further, declaring that “as the Federal Constitution is concerned, a legislature may pursue partisan ends when it engages in redistricting.”\n\nHaving abolished federal lawsuits challenging partisan gerrymanders, the Court’s Republicans then started to dismantle longstanding legal rules prohibiting racial gerrymanders — that is, legislative maps that are drawn to minimize the voting power of voters of a particular race. Indeed, the Court’s recent decision in LULAC, the Texas gerrymandering case, was a major milestone in this broader project to shut down anti-gerrymandering lawsuits. Among other things, LULAC held that “ambiguous” evidence must always be construed against a plaintiff alleging that a map was drawn for impermissible racial reasons.\n\nIt probably goes too far to say that this Court would allow literally any racial gerrymander to survive judicial scrutiny. If a state passed a law called the “White Supremacist We Want to Bring Back Jim Crow, So These Maps Were Drawn by the Ku Klux Klan Act of 2026,” it is likely that at least two of the Court’s Republicans would vote to strike it down. But LULAC and other recent Supreme Court decisions impose such high barriers on anti-gerrymandering plaintiffs that a state legislature’s racist intent would need to be extraordinarily explicit before this Court would step in.\n\nAnd so the Republican justices voted to uphold a Democratic gerrymander in Tangipa. They did not do so because they are particularly worried about Democratic voting rights or Democratic chances in the midterms. They did so because that decision is consistent with their broader project to eliminate nearly all lawsuits challenging gerrymanders.",

    "fullText": "While copyright and licensing currently form the core legal \nstructures that support Free Software, a September 2025 ruling from the \nSpanish Supreme Court provides a legal precedent that underlines the \nimportance of transparency in source codes and algorithms, and support \nfor the Freedom to Study!\n\nIn 2009, the Spanish central government passed a law to\naward a so-called “social bonus” to an estimated 5 million\nhouseholds, in order to subsidise their electricity costs. A 2016 court\nruling later compelled the government to introduce stricter rules\nregulating who could receive this social bonus. All existing\nbeneficiaries were required to re-register by the end of 2018, whereupon\ntheir eligibility for the social bonus would be re-evaluated by a\nsoftware known as BOSCO, administered by the Spanish Ministry for Green\nEnergy Transition (the “Ministry”).\n\nFollowing this re-evaluation, close to 1.5\nmillion beneficiaries were approved for the social bonus. This was\nalmost a million fewer than the 2.4 million under the previous scheme,\nand significantly less than the estimated 4.5 million who fulfilled the\ncriteria to receive the social bonus in the first place. Several\napplicants who had been rejected contacted Civio, a non-profit based in Madrid that\nworks to investigate\nshortcomings in the public sector and advocate for positive changes\nto support transparency and social support, raising suspicions that the\nBOSCO software had failed to properly review their claims.\n\nAs highlighted by AlgorithmWatch,\none of the complaints to Civio involved a retired widower who applied\nfor the social bonus under means testing. Under the regulations, she\nwould still be eligible for the bonus due to her status as a retiree and\na widower, even if her income exceeded the maximum to be eligible under\nmeans testing. BOSCO nevertheless discarded her application\nautomatically.\n\nCivio therefore contacted the Ministry to ask for BOSCO’s source\ncode, in order to confirm the veracity of the testimonials that they had\nreceived, as well as to check for other malfunctions. In response, the\nCouncil\nof Transparency and Good Governance (the “Council”), Spain’s freedom\nof information authority, denied Civio’s request, on the grounds of\nprotection of “intellectual property rights”, and protection of personal\ndata. This in turn prompted Civio to file\nan administrative appeal, which kicked off the lengthy judicial\nprocess that concluded in September 2025 in the Supreme Court of Spain\n(the “Court”).\n\nThe Supreme\nCourt ruling displayed a general support of transparency and the\nFreedom to Study, by clearly stating that Civio’s initial request for\naccess to BOSCO’s source code should be granted. In doing so, the Court\nhas now established a concrete legal precedent in Spain that the Freedom\nto Study is constitutionally necessary in the context of publicly\nadministered software programmes a algorithms, and in accordance with\nprinciples inherent to a democratic state .\n\nExplaining its position, the Court stated that:\n\n“… the right to access to public information transcends its\nstatus as an objective principle governing the actions of public\nadministrations, to constitute a constitutional right that can be\nexercised, as a subjective right, against administrations, derived from\nthe demands of democracy and transparency, and inseparably linked to the\ndemocratic rule of law set out in Article 1 of our\nConstitution.”\n\nIn simpler terms, the Court’s analysis on the importance of public\ntransparency relating to software programmes and algorithms can be\nbroken down into the following key findings:\n\nIn reviewing Civio’s request for access to BOSCO’s source code, the\nCourt was quick to emphasise that the validity of public administrations\nto make use of automated decision-making systems was not in question.\nIndeed, it recognised that such automated processes were often essential\nfor efficiency and adequate provision of public services.\n\nRather, the Court stressed the need for the principle of transparency\nto continue to be observed even in the use of such automatic systems, as\nenshrined in Article 105.b of the Spanish\nConstitution. It is therefore a legal requirement in Spain for\npublic administrations to allow citizens to access fundamental features\nof the algorithms used in decision-making, or their source code.\n\nThe Court considered such transparency to be associated with an\nimportant broader concept that it called “digital or electronic\ndemocracy”:\n\n“Digital democracy is not only a technological extension of\nrepresentative democracy, but also the fruit of a real structural\ntransformation in the democratic functioning of public authorities,\ncharacterised by the validity of the principles of transparency,\nparticipation, and accountability in a digital environment, where access\nto public information and algorithmic transparency play an essential\nrole in guaranteeing it.”\n\nPublic authorities are therefore obliged to allow citizens to\nunderstand how algorithms used in decision-making that affect citizens\nwork. The Spanish Supreme Court considers that doing so would be inline\nwith the principles of digital democracy, in order to allow citizens to\nknow, control, and participate in public management.\n\nIn Spain, Article 14(1)(j) of the Spanish Law on\nTransparency, Access to Public Information and Good Governance (the\n“LTAIBG”) allows access of information to be limited if such access is\ndetrimental to what they referred to as “intellectual property rights”.\nIndeed, throughout the litigation of this case, the Ministry relied on\nthis provision to argue on the vague and unspecific claim that BOSCO’s\nsource code was protected generally by “intellectual property rights”,\nwhich gave the Ministry the option to refuse to share BOSCO’s source\ncode with Civio.\n\nSimilarly, Article 14(1)(a) of the LTAIBG restricted access of public\ninformation on national or public security grounds, and was also relied\non by the Ministry in its arguments to refuse access to BOSCO’s source\ncode.\n\nThe Court found that, while the right to access of public information\nis neither unlimited nor absolute, the restrictions stated in the LTAIBG\nmust be applied in a manner that is justified and proportionate. This in\nturn has to be decided by a weighing of the interests at stake, namely\nthe importance of the access to public information on the one hand, and\nthe importance of protecting the rights of the copyright holders of\nBOSCO, or of any national security concerns, on the other. Indeed, it\nconsidered that while copyright and security concerns are important\nconsiderations, they cannot be invoked as automatic shields for\nsecrecy.\n\nWhen weighing these interests against each other, the Court gave\nparticular importance to Civio’s request for BOSCO’s source code. It\nrecognized that the public relevance of Civio’s investigation into\nwhether BOSCO was functioning correctly was of significant magnitude: it\nserved to ensure the protection of consumers who are in a more fragile\nsocial and economic situation, specifically in this case to protect them\nagainst energy poverty.\n\nAccordingly, the Court found that the mere risk of possible harm to\nthe “intellectual property rights” of the public administration was not\nsufficiently important enough to be considered valid grounds for\nrefusing Civio’s right of access, when weighed against the significance\nof Civio’s investigation.\n\nSimilarly, when considering possible risks to public security, the\nCourt found that a request for source code and algorithmic transparency\ndoes not contain or include personal data of the citizens applying for\nthe social bonus. This was sufficient for the Court to consider that the\npublic interest for Civio to access BOSCO’s source code outweighed any\npublic security concerns.\n\nInterestingly, the Court further noted that even if access to BOSCO’s\nsource code could potentially increase certain security risks,\ntransparency itself can contribute towards counterbalancing this risk,\nsince it would:\n\nthat the right of access to public information takes on special\nrelevance in light of how digital technologies are exercised in the use\nof public powers and the provision of public services. Such use of\ncomputerized and automated decision-making systems in public\nadministration, especially when their purpose is the recognition of\nsocial rights, must necessarily entail transparency of the computer\nprocesses followed in such actions.\n\nThis kind of transparency, which the Court recognized to include the\npossibility of access to source code, has the effect of providing\ncitizens with the necessary information for their understanding and\nknowledge of their operation, in order to make it possible to check the\nconformity of such systems against the applicable regulatory\nprovisions.\n\nIndeed, the Court recognized that such fundamental principles of\ntransparency and access to public information in the public use of\ndigital technology are not just unique to Spanish jurisdiction, but are\nalso the logical extension of Article 42 of the Charter\nof Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the “CFR”):\n\n“Any citizen of the Union, and any natural or legal person residing\nor having its registered office in a Member State, has a right of access\nto documents of the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the\nUnion, whatever their medium.”\n\nThe Spanish Supreme Court’s conclusions in the BOSCO case clearly\nlays out the importance of transparency of source code and algorithms in\npublic administrations, and how they are important to the healthy\nfunctioning of societies that depend on digital technology. It is\ngratifying to see a European court clearly lay out how important it is\nto have public access to knowledge on how software and algorithms work,\nespecially when they have significant impact on the lives of individuals\nat large.\n\nNevertheless, while we appreciate the recognition of the importance\nof transparency in publicly administered source code by the Spanish\nSupreme Court here, this case only establishes this limited standard in\nSpain. While the aforementioned Article 42 of the CFR can be\ninterpreted to include algorithmic transparency and access to source\ncode used by public administrations, the interpretation taken by the\nSpanish Supreme Court is still not a unified stance seen throughout the\nEU.\n\nStill, some positive steps can be seen in other European\njurisdictions. For example, in France, the Digital Republic Law (\"Loi\npour une République numérique”) of 2016 codifies source code as part\nof government documentation that must be released in certain\ncircumstances. Of course, this does not necessarily mean that all\npublicly administered source code is immediately available in practice\nin France, as there have been cases in the past of the French\ncourts blocking access even after the Digital Republic Law came into\nforce.\n\nThere also remain other EU jurisdictions that are resistant to the\npublic access of state administered code. For example, in the\nNetherlands, the Debat\nDirect app, which allows the public to view livestreams of the\ndebates in the Dutch House of Representatives (Tweede Kamer), is only\navailable in the Apple, Google, and Microsoft app stores and is not\navailable under a Free Software licence. When FSFE Dutch volunteer Jos\nvan den Oever was unable to run the app on his devices and made a\nrequest for the Debat Direct source code from the Dutch parliament,\nthe resulting legal proceedings unfortunately resulted in a ruling that\nthe code should remain unavailable to the public.\n\nIn addition to the Freedom to Study, an informed and empowered\ncitizenry also needs other\nfreedoms that come with Free Software, in order to enjoy true\nsovereignty in our current society that is defined by its reliance on\ndigital technology. We therefore ask that the European courts take a\nleaf from the Spanish Supreme Court’s book in weighing the true social\ncosts of non-free publicly administered algorithms and programmes,\nespecially when faced with arguments for the mere sake of protection of\nintellectual property.\n\nIndeed, this is exactly why the FSFE’s Public Money? Public Code! (PMPC)\ncampaign has been working to ensure that this philosophy of\ntransparency, collaboration, and innovation in public administrations is\nupheld throughout Europe. Software used by public administrations have\nthe ability to closely affect the lives of the public, regardless of\nwhether or not these members of the public are users of the software.\nHaving such software be released as Free Software returns control of\npublic administration to the people, and is a crucial step to ensure\ndigital democracy.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge said Tuesday that he knows of no U.S. Supreme Court precedent to justify the Pentagon's censuring of a sitting U.S. senator who joined a videotaped plea for troops to resist unlawful orders from the Trump administration.\n\nSen. Mark Kelly had a front-row seat in a courtroom as his attorneys urged U.S. District Judge Richard Leon to block the Pentagon from punishing the Arizona Democrat, a retired U.S. Navy pilot. Leon didn't immediately rule from the bench on Kelly's claims that Pentagon officials violated his First Amendment free speech rights.\n\nBut the judge appeared to be skeptical of key arguments that a government attorney made in defense of Kelly's Jan. 5 censure from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\n“You're asking me to do something the Supreme Court has never done,” the judge told Justice Department attorney John Bailey. “Isn't that a bit of a stretch?”\n\nBailey argued that Congress decided that retired military service members are subject to the same Uniform Code of Military Justice that applies to active-duty troops.\n\n“Retirees are part of the armed forces,” Bailey said. “They are not separated from the services.”\n\nBenjamin Mizer, one of Kelly's lawyers, said they aren't aware of any ruling to support the notion that military retirees have “diminished speech rights.” And he argued that the First Amendment clearly protects Kelly's speech in this case.\n\n“And any other approach would be to make new law,” Mizer added.\n\nLeon, who was nominated to the bench by Republican President George W. Bush, said the Pentagon's actions against Kelly could have a chilling effect on “many, many other retirees who wish to voice their opinion.”\n\nThe judge said he hopes to issue a ruling by next Wednesday. Kelly shook hands with two government attorneys after the hearing.\n\nIn November, Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers appeared on a video in which they urged troops to uphold the Constitution and not to follow unlawful military directives from the Trump administration.\n\nRepublican President Donald Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition “punishable by DEATH” in a social media post days later. Hegseth said Kelly’s censure was “a necessary process step” to proceedings that could result in a demotion from the senator’s retired rank of captain and subsequent reduction in retirement pay.\n\nThe 90-second video was first posted on a social media account belonging to Sen. Elissa Slotkin. Reps. Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander and Chrissy Houlahan also appeared in the video. All of the participants are veterans of the armed services or intelligence communities.\n\nThe Pentagon began investigating Kelly in late November, citing a federal law that allows retired service members to be recalled to active duty on orders of the defense secretary for possible court-martial or other punishment.\n\nHegseth has said Kelly was the only one of the six lawmakers to be investigated because he is the only one who formally retired from the military and still falls under the Pentagon’s jurisdiction.",

Jackson case that overturned the federal right to an abortion.\n\nThe court has also been rocked by revelations about disagreements among the justices, including a bitter debate about a case involving Idaho’s abortion ban, a battle over the court’s toothless ethics rules, and a confidential memo in which Roberts pushed to grant Trump broad immunity from prosecution.\n\nRoberts’ decision to impose NDAs came just weeks after the Times quoted from the confidential immunity memos, according to the Times.\n\nThe move comes as critics are calling for more transparency at the Supreme Court, which is facing record-low public trust as the conservative justices greenlight the vast majority of Trump’s policies.\n\nRoberts, however, went in the other direction and mandated more secrecy, not less.\n\nThe last time prior to 2024 that Supreme Court clerks were asked to sign a document agreeing to abide by the court’s confidentiality rules appears to have been in the late 1990s, after a former clerk published a tell-all book in 1998, according to the Times.\n\nThose documents, however, did not amount to legal NDAs, according to some of the clerks that signed them.\n\nThe switch to formal contracts is “a sign of the court’s own weakness” and the erosion of internal cohesion, Mark Fenster, a University of Florida law professor, told the Times.",

    "fullText": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Utah Gov. Spencer Cox signed a bill Saturday that expands the state Supreme Court from five justices to seven as frustration has mounted among Republican lawmakers over a string of defeats before the tribunal.\n\nRepublican advocates for the change argued that it would help improve the court's efficiency. But legal experts said it could have the opposite effect and set a dangerous precedent at a time of tension between the branches of government. The state's judiciary did not ask for more justices on the high court.\n\nDemocrats, who were united in opposition to the bill, called timing suspicious. Last week the Legislature asked the court to overturn a redistricting ruling that gave Democrats a strong shot at picking up one of Utah’s four Republican-held congressional seats in the fall.\n\nNew justices could be in place when the court decides the fate of the congressional map.\n\nBecause the bill received approval from more than two-thirds of legislators, it took effect immediately after the governor signed it, allowing him to bypass a several-month waiting period to start adding justices.\n\nIn Utah, justices are appointed by the governor and approved by the state Senate. Justices in many other states are elected.\n\nMost states have five or seven Supreme Court justices, but a few have nine. Cox, a Republican, has said the additions would put Utah in line with other states of its size. He has denied that the policy is politically motivated, noting that Republican governors and senators have made all recent appointments.\n\nOnce he fills the new seats, Cox will have appointed five of the seven sitting justices.\n\nLast month Republican lawmakers took authority from state Supreme Court justices to select their own chief justice and gave that power to the governor.\n\n“Seven sets of eyes reviewing the most complex and difficult issues our state has ever faced is better than having only five sets of eyes,” said House Majority Leader Casey Snider, a Republican sponsor of the bill.\n\nJohn Pearce, who recently retired as associate chief justice, said this month that he doubted the change would make the court more efficient.\n\n“The more sets of comments you have to take into account, the longer the process takes,” Pearce said. “If what the Legislature is hoping to do is speed up the work of the court, it's going to be counterproductive.”\n\nTwo states — Arizona and Georgia — have added justices in the past decade after making similar arguments about efficiency.\n\nIn the first few years after Arizona grew its court in 2016, several past and present justices said it made things less efficient because more people had to review opinions before they could be published.\n\nArizona's court now issues slightly more rulings per year, while Georgia's issues slightly fewer than before.\n\nUtah Chief Justice Matthew Durrant told legislators on the opening day of the 2026 session that the court had “essentially no backlog” and urged them to add judges to lower courts, where the need is greater. Bill sponsors responded by adding some lower court judges and clerks.\n\nThe Utah State Bar has raised concern over the expansion and other proposals that it said would weaken the judiciary's independence. Among them is a bill that would create a new trial court with exclusive jurisdiction to hear constitutional challenges. The proposal would limit the ability of other judges and courts to block potentially unconstitutional state laws with injunctions.\n\nRepublicans have also been collecting signatures to try to place on the November ballot an initiative that would restore their ability to draw voting districts that deliberately favor a political party, a practice known as gerrymandering.\n\nLee reported from Santa Fe, New Mexico.",

    "fullText": "PANAMA CITY (AP) — Panama's president moved to assure the public on Friday that critical ports at both ends of the Panama Canal will continue to operate without interruption — a day after the country’s Supreme Court ruled that the concession held by a subsidiary of Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison Holdings was unconstitutional.\n\nThe court's decision late Thursday advances a U.S. aim to block any influence by China over the strategic waterway and immediately drew a sharp rebuke from Beijing.\n\nPanamanian President José Raúl Mulino said that until the court's ruling is executed — a period of time he did not specify — Panama's Maritime Authority would work with Panama Ports Company, the CK Hutchison subsidiary, to ensure continuing operations at the port.\n\nOnce the concession is formally ended, a local subsidiary of Danish logistics company A.P. Moller-Maersk will operate the ports in a transitional phase until a new concession can be bid and awarded, Mulino said.\n\n“Panama moves forward, its ports will continue operating without interruption and we will continue serving the world at the logistics center of excellence that we are,” Mulino said in a recorded video address.\n\nThe court’s ruling followed an audit by Panama’s comptroller, which alleged irregularities in the 25-year extension of the concession, granted in 2021.\n\nThe Trump administration made blocking China’s influence over the Panama Canal one of its priorities in the hemisphere. Panama was U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s first overseas stop as the United States’ top diplomat. On Friday, Rubio said on X that “the United States is encouraged by the recent Panamanian Supreme Court’s decision to rule port concessions to China unconstitutional.”\n\nDespite the insistence by Panama’s government and the canal authority that China has no influence over its operations, Rubio made clear that the U.S. viewed the operation of the ports as a national security issue. U.S. President Donald Trump had gone so far as to say Panama should return the canal to U.S. control.\n\nThe court’s brief statement gave no guidance on what would happen to the ports now.\n\nThe ruling draws backlash from Hong Kong\n\nCK Hutchison’s subsidiary, Panama Ports Company, said it has not been notified yet about the decision but insisted its concession was the result of transparent international bidding.\n\nIt said in its statement that the ruling “lacks legal basis and jeopardizes not only PPC and its contract, but also the well-being and stability of thousands of Panamanian families who depend directly and indirectly on port activity, but also the rule of law and legal certainty in the country.”\n\nIt said that it reserves all rights to proceed legally in Panama or elsewhere, but gave no more details.\n\nThe Hong Kong government firmly rejected the ruling in a statement, saying it strongly opposes any foreign government using coercive, repressive or other unreasonable means to seriously harm the business interests of Hong Kong enterprises. It said the Panamanian government should respect the spirit of contracts and provide a fair business environment.\n\n“Given the current situation in Panama, Hong Kong enterprises should carefully review their existing and future investments there,\" it said.\n\nIn Beijing, China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, told reporters that China would take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of “the Chinese company,” without elaborating on the potential steps.\n\nPolitical analyst Edwin Cabrera said once the parties are notified, the issue of what to do with the ports goes to Panama’s executive branch, specifically the Panama Maritime Authority.\n\n“I have the impression from conversations that I have had with some people that the operation (of the ports) will not stop,” Cabrera said.\n\nA sale deal that apparently angered Beijing\n\nCK Hutchison Holdings announced a deal last year to sell its majority stake in the Panamanian ports and others around the world to an international consortium that included BlackRock Inc. But the deal appeared to stall over objections by the Chinese government.\n\nThe company said last July that it was considering seeking a Chinese investor to join as a significant member of the consortium, a move that some interpreted as way to please Beijing, but CK Hutchison hasn't said more since.\n\nThe awkward position the company found itself in highlights the challenges Hong Kong business elites face in navigating Beijing’s expectations of national loyalty, especially when relations between China and the United States are strained. CK Hutchison is owned by the family of Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing.\n\nLast year, Panama’s comptroller audited the concession to the Panama Ports Company, which had held the contract to operate the ports since 1997. The concession was renewed in 2021 for 25 years, during the prior Panamanian administration.\n\nComptroller Anel Flores said the audit found payments that were not made, accounting errors and the apparent existence of “ghost” concessions operating within the ports since 2015. The company denied those allegations.\n\nThe audit determined that the irregularities had cost the government about $300 million since the concession was extended and an estimated $1.2 billion during the original 25-year contract.\n\nFlores also said the extension was granted without the required endorsement of his office.\n\nOn July 30, the comptroller challenged the Panama Ports Company’s contract to operate the ports before the Supreme Court.",

    "fullText": "We’re able to produce the journalism that you rely on because of our Vox Members. Support independent journalism that matters — become a Vox Member today.\n\nThe Supreme Court is currently considering whether the Constitution requires public schools to out transgender students to their parents, even when those students inform the school that they do not want their family to be informed of their gender identity. The case, which is currently pending on the Court’s shadow docket, is known as Mirabelli v. Bonta.\n\nCalifornia law provides that public school employees “shall not be required to disclose any information related to a pupil’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression to any other person without the pupil’s consent unless otherwise required by state or federal law.” The plaintiffs in Mirabelli argue that this law is unconstitutional, and they ask the justices to embrace a trial judge’s claim that “when gender incongruence is observed…parents have a right to be informed.”\n\nThe Mirabelli plaintiffs, in other words, claim that the Constitution requires the government to side with parents in an internal family dispute with their own children. When a public school student wants to keep their trans identity secret from their parents, these plaintiffs argue, government employees are constitutionally required to defy the child’s wishes and inform the parents regardless.\n\nThe Supreme Court is currently considering a case that would force teachers to out transgender students to their parents, even if the student fears abuse or otherwise asks the teacher to keep their secret.\n\nThis case arises just months after Mahmoud v. Taylor, a landmark victory for the religious right that targeted books with LGBTQ+ characters.\n\nBoth cases are part of an overarching project to impose religious conservative values on public schools.\n\nNor is Mirabelli an isolated case. While Mirabelli sits on the Court’s shadow docket (a forum for expedited matters that the justices often decide without explaining why they ruled the way they did), the Court is also weighing whether to hear a nearly identical case, known as Foote v. Ludlow School Committee on its merits docket (unlike shadow docket cases, the justices typically release a published opinion explaining why they ruled the way they did in merits docket cases). Last year, Justice Samuel Alito complained in a third case that, in his view, too many lower courts are avoiding the question of “whether a school district violates parents’ fundamental rights” when they permit a transgender student to socially transition.\n\nOff the Court, the Federalist Society, the powerful legal group with close ties to the Republican justices, hosted a debate at its most recent national convention on whether “parents have a constitutional right to know and consent to public school facilitation of their children’s gender-identity transition.”\n\nThis question, in other words, is clearly a matter of great importance to the conservative legal movement’s religious wing. And the Supreme Court’s Republican majority rarely breaks with the religious right on its high-priority issues.\n\nIt is inevitable that public school teachers, and the officials who write the curricula taught by public school teachers, will shape the moral beliefs of their students. Indeed, the Supreme Court historically viewed this reality as a good thing. As the Court said in 1979, one of the public school system’s most important functions is to “inculcat[e] fundamental values necessary to the maintenance of a democratic political system.”\n\nTo the extent that Americans disagree about which values these schools should teach, the United States has historically managed these disagreements by giving the lion’s share of control over public schools to state governments and local school boards. A school in rural Arkansas may teach different books than a school in Manhattan. And that’s okay.\n\nLawsuits like Mirabelli and Foote, by contrast, seek to centralize control over public schools in a Supreme Court dominated by conservative Republicans. And those six Republicans recently showed that they are very eager to become superintendents of the entire nation’s public schools.\n\nUntil very recently, federal courts firmly rejected the idea that courts should micromanage how public schools teach and relate to their students — largely due to concerns that schools would find it impossible to function if they were subject to such management. In a 1948 opinion, for example, Justice Robert Jackson wrote that there were “256 separate and substantial religious bodies” within the United States, and warned that “if we are to eliminate everything that is objectionable to any of these warring sects or inconsistent with any of their doctrines, we will leave public education in shreds.”\n\nThis hands-off era came to an abrupt halt last June, however, with the Supreme Court’s decision in Mahmoud v. Taylor (2025).\n\nIn Mahmoud, the Court’s Republican majority held that parents who object to books with LGBTQ+ characters or themes must be informed if those books will be used in their child’s classroom, and given a chance to opt their child out of that lesson. But the opinion speaks in broad terms, suggesting that any parent who objects to any lesson on religious grounds must be given this right — even if the school district could not possibly have known about the parent’s objection in advance.\n\nAmong other things, Mahmoud is likely to impose a “Don’t Say Gay” regime on public schools throughout the country. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned in dissent, many school districts “cannot afford to engage in costly litigation over opt-out rights or to divert resources to tracking and managing student absences.” And so their only practical option will be to “censor their curricula” to remove material that might trigger a religious objection from anyone.\n\nMahmoud, in other words, fundamentally reshaped the relationship between public schools and the judiciary, forcing judges to police schools for any lesson that might trouble any person’s religious beliefs. And, as Mirabelli and similar cases show, advocates for the religious right are already demanding more from their allies on the Supreme Court.\n\nJustice Jackson’s warning about “leaving public education in shreds” was rooted in the Court’s longstanding belief that public schools are an essential institution, and that the Constitution must be interpreted in a way that allows this institution to thrive.\n\nAs the Court said six years later in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), its most famous intervention in state education policy, “education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments” — and not just because it prepares children to hold a job as adults, but also because it enables people to be good Americans who contribute to the collective project of the nation. Public schools, the Court explained in Brown, lay “the very foundation of good citizenship.” They enable citizens to perform “our most basic public responsibilities.” And they “awaken[] the child to cultural values” that schools seek to inculcate in all Americans.\n\nThis is why modern-day public schools typically teach texts like the Declaration of Independence, with its statement that “all men are created equal,” or Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech. These texts are a kind of secular liturgy, taught to all Americans in the hope that we will all embrace liberal democratic values.\n\nIndeed, before Mahmoud, the Court’s conservative wing had historically been even more protective of public schools’ role as evangelists of universal American values than more liberal justices. Consider, for example, Ambach v. Norwick (1979), where a 5-4 Court upheld a New York state law that prohibited noncitizens from being public school teachers unless they were actively trying to become citizens. The five most conservative justices who served at the time formed the majority.\n\nThose five justices reasoned that, because training children to be good US citizens is one of the most important functions of public schools, the schools could refuse to hire teachers who are uninterested in US citizenship. Public schools, Justice Lewis Powell wrote for the Court, are an “‘assimilative force’ by which diverse and conflicting elements in our society are brought together on a broad but common ground.” Hence Powell’s conclusion that public schools “inculcat[e] fundamental values necessary to the maintenance of a democratic political system.”\n\nGiven the high regard the Supreme Court used to hold for public education, it used to avoid reading the Constitution in ways that would undermine public schools’ ability to function. In Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District (1969), for example, the Court famously declared that students do not “shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.” Yet it also held that those rights must yield when they disrupt teachers’ ability to educate.\n\nUnder Tinker, a public school student may not claim First Amendment protection when their speech “materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others.” The justices recognized that public schools could not function if students had a right to disrupt lessons, so they carefully crafted a rule that respects student free speech without undercutting the school’s ability to teach math, history, or American values.\n\nMahmoud is incompatible with this more modest approach to judging. Much like a school that teaches the Declaration of Independence in order to foster American values like universal equality, the school district in Mahmoud said that it wanted its curriculum to include some books with LGBTQ+ characters in order to showcase American values such as “the richness of cultural pluralism and commonality.”\n\nBut it was this very effort to, in Ambach’s words, inculcate children in “fundamental values” that the Republican justices found objectionable in Mahmoud. According to Justice Samuel Alito’s majority opinion, the LGBTQ-themed books were unacceptable precisely because they were “designed to present certain values and beliefs as things to be celebrated.”\n\nThe holding of Mahmoud, moreover, was extraordinarily broad. It seems to say that all public schools must notify parents in advance if they plan to teach a lesson that those parents object to on religious grounds, and that the school must also allow the parents to opt their child out of that lesson.\n\nBut, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in dissent, this rule will create “chaos” in public schools because it is not possible for schools to anticipate every objection that a parent might raise, and to warn them in advance. In previous court cases, parents raised religious objections to lessons touching on topics as varied as divorce, interfaith couples, “immodest dress,” evolution, pacifism, magic, women achieving things outside of the home, and “false views of death.” How is a school that wants to teach, say, a biography of President Ronald Reagan supposed to know, in advance, if one of its students’ parents finds this book objectionable because Reagan was divorced?\n\nIn criticizing Mahmoud, I want to be clear that I do not object to the Court’s conclusion that classroom instruction on sensitive topics like sexuality may sometimes violate the Constitution’s religious protections. The problem with Mahmoud is that it imposes an impossible burden on public schools, requiring them to anticipate any religious view that might be held by any parent. What the Court should have done instead is the exact same thing it did in Tinker: craft a legal rule that respects constitutional rights without undermining public schools’ ability to function.\n\nBut the kind of conservatism that respects institutions like public schools is no longer present on the Supreme Court. It’s been replaced by a conservatism that fetishizes the interests of the religious right.\n\nSo what, then, does Mahmoud mean for Mirabelli, and for other cases where religious conservatives want to control public schools? The short answer is that Mahmoud is a very helpful case for the Mirabelli plaintiffs. If the Constitution requires teachers to tell parents if they plan to teach a book with a trans character, why wouldn’t it also require them to tell a student’s parents if the student says they are trans?\n\nOne possible answer, as the appeals court that heard Mirabelli concluded, is that Mahmoud applies only to “curricular requirements” and not to “general operational policies that involve no instruction.”\n\nAt the Federalist Society’s debate on whether public schools must out trans children, University of Chicago law professor Mary Anne Case argued extending Mahmoud beyond a school’s curriculum would be even more disruptive than Mahmoud itself.\n\n“Many parents have extremely strong religious ethical views about the foods a child consumes,” Case pointed out. If a child’s parent wants their family to only eat kosher or halal food, does that mean that the school must immediately inform the parents if their child is caught with a piece of bacon? If a parent wants their child to wear “religious garb,” is the school supposed to monitor that child to make sure that they do not remove a hijab or a yarmulke? Similarly, if a child holds different religious views than their parents, is the school required to warn the parents if that student wears a headscarf, a kippah, or a cross necklace at school?\n\nIf a parent believes, for religious reasons, that their child should not form romantic attachments prior to marriage, are teachers obligated to tell the child’s parents if they are dating someone? What if the student is gay, and the parents object to homosexuality? Are schools required to reveal that information as well? And, what happens if teachers reasonably believe that the parents may be abusive? If a student tells their teacher that they are scared because their father will beat them or kick them out of the house if he discovers that they are trans, does the Constitution really require this teacher to out the student?\n\nUnfortunately, it’s unlikely that any of these arguments will persuade this Supreme Court — the Republican justices already revealed in Mahmoud that they do not care if their approach to religious liberty forces public schools to do the impossible. But there is another reason why Mirabelli is different from Mahmoud that could be more persuasive to this Court.\n\nAs the appeals court that ruled against the Mirabelli plaintiffs noted, “the challenged policies appear to apply only when a student makes the voluntary decision to share their gender nonconformity with the school.” The Mahmoud opinion has very little to say about the right of students to express themselves or form their own beliefs, possibly because that case primarily dealt with younger students who may not yet have formed opinions on gender or sexuality.\n\nBut when a child tells their teacher that they are transgender, and that they do not want their parents to know this fact about them, that child is asserting their own right to self-definition. They are also implicitly asserting a religious belief. A child who tells a teacher that they are trans, and that they do not want their parents to know because of their parents’ anti-trans religious views, is exercising their constitutional right to hold religious beliefs that are different from their parents’.\n\nThe heart of the Mirabelli plaintiffs’ claim is that a parent’s right to exercise their religion trumps the right of the child to exercise theirs. But the Constitution provides that all people, parents and children alike, may freely exercise their faith.\n\nMirabelli is rooted in a fairly explicit vision of parents as domineering figures who control all aspects of their children’s lives, even against the wishes of those very children. And the Mirabelli plaintiffs claim that the Constitution obligates the government to enforce parental domination. At one point, their brief even quotes a dissenting opinion from Justice Clarence Thomas, which argues that minors should be stripped of their First Amendment rights because “the concept of total parental control over children’s lives extended into the schools.”\n\nAccordingly, the plaintiffs’ most radical legal argument is rooted in an old Supreme Court precedent that they read to say that parents have a “right of control” over their children.\n\nIt is true that, more than a century ago, the Supreme Court handed down two cases — Meyer v. Nebraska (1923) and Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925) — that held that parents enjoy some amount of “liberty” to “direct the upbringing and education of children.” But those cases involved far more modest legal claims than the one in Mirabelli. In Meyer, the Court struck down a Nebraska law that forbade teachers at private schools from teaching foreign languages prior to the eighth grade. And in Pierce, the Court struck down an Oregon law that forbade most parents from sending their kids to a private school altogether.\n\nIf Meyer and Pierce were decided today, the Court most likely would reach the same result, but for very different reasons. A ban on teaching foreign languages obviously violates the First Amendment’s free speech protections. And the Oregon law struck down in Pierce was almost certainly motivated by anti-Catholic sentiment and a desire to ban parochial schools, and thus violates the Constitution’s guarantee that everyone may practice their faith.\n\nBut the Supreme Court’s approach to individual rights was completely haphazard in the 1920s, and it paid no heed to the text of the Constitution. The Court frequently made up “rights” that do not appear in the Constitution, such as a “freedom of contract” that was frequently used to strike down laws protecting workers. Meanwhile, textually protected rights such as free speech more or less did not exist in the 1920s, at least according to the Supreme Court.\n\nYet, while the Supreme Court largely repudiated this anti-textual approach to constitutional interpretation in the 1930s, Meyer and Pierce remain good law. So the Mirabelli plaintiffs are correct that, under current law, parents do enjoy some amount of “liberty” to raise their children as they choose. But neither case — both of which merely said that parents may send their children to private schools which may teach different subjects or instill different values than public schools — has ever permitted parents to control how public schools operate.\n\nParents, of course, have a near-absolute right to decide which values they wish to teach their own children. But it is neither possible, nor desirable, for a family to completely insulate its children from other value systems and ideas. And the fundamental question presented by cases like Mirabelli is whether American society as a whole should also play a role in shaping public school students’ values. If a family wishes to teach its children that pluralistic democratic values are wicked, are public schools forbidden from teaching an alternative viewpoint?\n\nBefore Mahmoud, the judiciary’s answer to this question was an emphatic “no.” Disagreements about which values should be taught in public schools were dealt with democratically, through elections for state legislature or local school boards. But a family that wants to teach their children that, say, white people are inherently superior to Black people, couldn’t sue their local school board because they don’t want their child to read To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nLitigants like the Mirabelli plaintiffs reject this kind of federalized pluralism as well. The fundamental premise of their lawsuit is that control over public education should be transferred from state and local authorities to Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. They want a one-size-fits-all approach to education — just so long as the one size is selected by Republicans in the nation’s capitol.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court for the past year has repeatedly allowed President Donald Trump to fire heads of independent agencies, but it appears to be drawing a line with the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe court has signaled for months that it sees the Fed in a different light. It has said that the president can fire directors of other agencies for any reason, but can remove Fed governors only “for cause,” which is often interpreted to mean neglect of duty or malfeasance.\n\nLast year, the court allowed President Donald Trump to fire — at least temporarily — Gwynne Wilcox, a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and Cathy Harris, a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, but it carved out a distinction for the Fed. The two officials had argued that if Trump could fire them, he could also fire members of the Fed’s board of governors.\n\n“We disagree,” the court said then. “The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.”\n\nThat is now being put to the test in a case in front of the Supreme Court involving Trump's attempt to remove Fed governor Lisa Cook. On Wednesday during oral arguments, the court seemed inclined to keep Cook in her job.\n\nAllowing Cook’s firing to go forward “would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve,” said Justice Brett Kavanaugh, one of three Trump appointees on the nation’s highest court.\n\nBut the court largely skirted a key issue: What, exactly, is the legal principle that protects the Fed, but not the other agencies?\n\nSeveral legal experts say the justices are on shaky ground. The Fed, they argue, is similar in many ways to the Federal Trade Commission or the National Labor Relations Board, agencies Congress intended to be independent but whose officials Trump has been able to fire without pushback from the high court.\n\n“There’s no historical grounds for distinguishing the Fed from other independent agencies that Congress has designed,” said Jane Manners, a law professor at Fordham University. “The whole argument was premised on the idea that the Fed is different. They haven’t explained exactly why.”\n\nPeter Conti-Brown, a professor of financial regulation at the University of Pennsylvania, added, “I’ll say as a legal scholar and as a historian I think that differentiation is hocus pocus.”\n\nJust last month, the court signaled in a separate oral argument that it would likely allow Trump to fire FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter. The conservative majority on the court also suggested it would overturn a 90-year-old precedent that sharply limited the president's ability to fire top officials at independent agencies.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts and many of his colleagues support the “unitary executive\" theory, which holds that the president should have full sway over the staffing of agencies in the executive branch.\n\nAgency directors, like Slaughter, “are exercising massive power over individual liberty and billion-dollar industries” without being accountable to anyone, Kavanaugh said at the December oral argument.\n\nWith the Federal Reserve, however, the Supreme Court's conservative justices have applied a different view: that the Fed’s monetary policy — the setting of short-term interest rates and management of the money supply — historically hasn’t been overseen by the executive branch.\n\nSome legal experts have likewise drawn a distinction between the Fed and other independent agencies. In a brief filed in the Cook case, Aaron Nielson, a law professor at the University of Texas, and formerly a top lawyer in Texas government, wrote that, “Whereas the modern FTC indisputably exercises executive power, the Fed's core function is monetary policy, which need not and often does not require executive power.\"\n\nThe First and Second Banks of the United States were nationwide banks that were the closest the United States had to a central bank in the first few decades after the nation's founding, and both “conducted early monetary policy,\" Nielson wrote, but weren't executive branch agencies.\n\nBut Lev Menand, a law professor at Columbia University and author of a book about the Fed, argued that the Fed does exercise executive power when it regulates the banking system. And monetary policy, when it adjusts the money supply, is part of that regulation, he said.\n\nThere are also only three types of government authority, Menand argues: legislative, executive, and judicial, and the Fed belongs in the executive category.\n\n“There is no fourth type of government power,” Menand said. \"There is no other place to locate the Fed.”\n\nStill, the justices mostly avoided addressing why the Fed is different during Wednesday's oral argument, in part, Menand noted, because neither side pushed it. Cook's lawyers had no reason to question a distinction that appeared to favor them.\n\nAnd even the government's own top Supreme Court lawyer, D. John Sauer, acknowledged that Trump could only fire Cook “for cause,” while in the other cases the White House had sought to remove officials for any reason, including policy differences. The distinction made it harder for the White House to argue that Cook should immediately be removed from office.\n\n“There is a long tradition of having this exercise of monetary policy be exercised independent of executive influence,\" Sauer said. “And we don’t dispute that that’s what Congress was doing.”\n\nPaul Clement, one of Cook's lawyers, told the justices, “it’s kind of why this case is, I think, problematic for the government because they could have come in here and said, you know, Fed, schmed, it’s not that different. This is just like the FTC.”\n\nInstead, Clement added, “they come in and say, no, we’re going to accept that the Fed is different, at least for purposes of this case.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court will initially rule on the narrow question of whether Cook can remain in her position while the larger dispute over her firing is fought in the lower courts. Still, at some point it may have to issue more comprehensive rulings that could include a fuller explanation of why the justices see the Fed as different.\n\nFor now, the Fed's size and impact on the financial markets may be offering it a measure of protection.\n\n“I don’t mean to denigrate any other agency, but there’s a reason that monetary policy has been treated differently, for lo these many years,” Clement said. “And there’s a reason that the markets watch the Fed a little more closely than they watch really any other agency of government.”",

After a selloff earlier this week, the S&P is again above 6,900 and within 1% of its all-time high. Gold hit another record yesterday, too.\n\nBut futures on the index were down 0.24% prior to the opening bell in New York and markets in Europe sold off slightly this morning after Asia closed mixed, a sign that traders are booking profits after yesterday’s rally. \n\nOn the macro front, Wall Street analysts are bullish. It’s a marked change from the fraught mood of the last few days.\n\nIn fact, Trump’s tariffs are turning out to be a much smaller economic deal than “earlier worst-case fears,” JPMorgan Chase says. Companies have adjusted their pricing and supply chains, and the result is “the realized tariff rate has been much lower at ~11% (versus expectations of 15%,”), according to Dubravko Lakos-Bujas and his team. “Only 14% of S&P 500 companies are highly sensitive to tariffs.”\n\nAnd it could get better if the U.S. Supreme Court decides the president lacks the power to unilaterally enact tariffs, the bank says.\n\n“Prediction markets assign >65% odds that the Supreme Court rules against the government, and those odds have consistently been against the government, especially following the November Supreme Court oral arguments,” Lakos-Bujas told clients.\n\nAnalysts were also cheered by a new upward revision for U.S. GDP in the third quarter of last year, at 4.4%.\n\n“The 4.4% real growth rate is much higher than normal and is likely to moderate over the course of the year, but if we can stay above 3% for the entire year it could lead to double-digit returns in the stock market,” Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management said in an email seen by Fortune.\n\nEY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco was singing from the same hymnbook. “Momentum was driven by resilient consumer spending, robust equipment and AI-related investment, a sizeable boost from net international trade, and a rebound in federal government outlays. The U.S. economy is neither overheating nor stalling—it is adjusting,” he said in a note.\n\nAll of that explains the calm we’re seeing in the markets today.\n\n“For some assets, it was almost like the selloff never happened, with the VIX index of volatility (-1.26pts) back at 15.64pts, which is beneath its levels prior to Saturday’s tariff announcements,” according to Jim Reid and his team at Deutsche Bank.",

    "fullText": "The court’s conservatives appear likely to block trump from firing Lisa Cook—not because they care about principle but because they care about the Fed.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Wednesday in Trump v. Cook, a case that centers on Donald Trump’s illegal attempt to fire Federal Reserve Board commissioner Lisa Cook. The legal arguments should be familiar to anyone who has been watching Trump’s authoritarian takeover of the federal government: Trump claims he has the authority to fire anybody he wants; Cook argues “that’s not how it works, that’s not how any of this works.”\n\nOver the past year, the Supreme Court has generally been game to allow Trump to fire whomever he wants. The court says Trump is entitled to this power under the “Unitary Executive Theory,” a fringe theory that was made up by Republican academics to justify dismantling the regulatory state and that has been adopted by Supreme Court Republicans over the past few years. The theory reimagines every independent agency created by Congress as part of Trump’s personal fiefdom. Based on this view, the Supreme Court has allowed Trump to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board (see Trump v. Wilcox); and it will likely allow him to fire commissioners from the Federal Trade Commission (see Trump v. Slaughter. If the theory holds, Trump should be able to fire Cook.\n\nBut here’s the benefit of using a made-up thing like Unitary Executive Theory: The Republicans on the court can make it do whatever they want it to do. While Trump has been busy waving his magic wand and shouting “unitarium executatus!” at the Fed, he’s failed to grasp that the Supreme Court is the author of the entire book of spells. The court can make the spell fizzle out whenever it wants.\n\nUnlike the NLRB and the FTC, Republicans on the court like the Fed. They like its independence. They like what it does. Since Unitary Executive Theory did not exist as a practical thing until Trump decided to take away the independence of all the executive agencies Republicans don’t like, it’s very easy for the Republican justices to say that Unitary Executive Theory doesn’t exist when it comes to the one independent agency they actually care about.\n\nIndeed, Chief Justice John Roberts laid the groundwork for granting the Fed a made-up cloak of protection during the Trump v. Wilcox arguments, which took place after Trump made his first noises about firing Cook. Anticipating her likely firing, Roberts noted that the Fed was a “uniquely structured, quasi-private” independent agency, distinct from all the others. Alleged attempted rapist Brett Kavanaugh has made similar statements. This means at least two Republican justices are already poised to allow Trump to run roughshod over every independent agency except the Fed.\n\nWhy? Well, the easy answer is that the Fed has a direct impact on the financial health of the Republicans on the Supreme Court and the donors who’ve bought them. The stability of monetary policy, and its independence from the crazy white supremacist installed in the White House, is important for the stock market, and thus all of the investments rich people have.\n\nIt’s also worth pointing out that destabilizing the Fed could, without hyperbole, crash the economy. Even beyond the matter of their personal finances, it’s likely that the Republican justices care about that. Remember, before the Roberts court was known as the most pro-authoritarian court in US history, it was widely regarded as the most pro-business court in US history.\n\nPractically speaking, giving Trump personal control over the Fed is bad for business. While the Republicans famously do not care about practicality when it comes to abortion rights or gun rights, when it comes to money? The Republicans care a great deal.\n\nThe majority of the justices’ evident skepticism toward Trump in this case are only really intelligible if you understand both the personal and national implications of the issue in front of the court. The core argument made by the Trump administration was that Cook was fired “for cause,” as is required by statute. The administration claims that the “cause” is an allegation that Cook committed mortgage fraud (she did not) before she was appointed to the Fed. Ostensibly, the justices were arguing over whether this particular alleged fraud is enough of a cause (because not only are the allegations false; they’re allegations over conduct from before she was on the Fed, which is not normally a “for cause” reason to fire somebody from a federal position). The justices were also arguing over whether Cook should have any opportunity to defend herself from these (again, provably false) allegations.\n\nAgain, Trump has fired people based on made-up allegations before. The only reason the court is skeptical about this firing, based on these made-up allegations, is that the ability to fire Fed commissioners at will places the monetary policy of the entire nation at the whim of Trump. We are literally watching Trump trying to push Fed chair Jerome Powell out right now, but he won’t have to push him if the court says the president can just fire Fed officials whenever he wants.\n\nBecause of this, Kavanaugh finally raised the question that he should have raised during every Trump-fires-someone case the court has heard thus far. He asked Solicitor General John Sauer what would stop future presidents from “manufacturing” artificial “cause” to justify firing Fed commissioners whose political positions they don’t like. Sauer said that Trump’s reasons were not manufactured, and that the “for cause” provision protects commissioners from being fired for policy reasons. But everyone knows that the only reason Cook was fired by Trump was policy reasons. Kavanaugh rightly intuited that if Trump can fire Cook, a future Democratic president can just come in and fire all the Trump appointees and install Fed commissioners loyal to the new administration’s monetary policies. Kavanaugh literally quoted himself—from his confirmation hearing, when he threatened retribution on his political enemies—and warned: “What goes around comes around.”\n\nThat’s always been true with these firing cases. Kavanaugh just suddenly cares about it now.\n\nNor is it just Kavanaugh who has suddenly decided to care about the obvious. Here’s what will really shock people who naively think the Republicans on the Supreme Court are committed to their own logic: I think Justice Sam Alito is in play for ruling against Trump. For the first time during Trump’s second reign, he sounded like he was trying to find a way to rule against the president—specifically, to send the case back down to a lower court to have it decide whether the alleged pre-office mortgage fraud was sufficient “cause” for this firing. Roberts and Kavanaugh wanted to end this attack on the Fed now, but Alito (and Ketanji Brown Jackson, to an extent) seemed interested in letting a lower court simply say “this isn’t cause,” as opposed to forcing the Supreme Court to do the dirty work.\n\nThe two justices most aligned with Trump’s position were Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, and that should not be surprising. Say what you will about those two (and I’ve said a lot about how much they suck), those guys are consistent in their belief that the practical consequences of their decisions should be ignored, even when their decisions lead to suffering and death. Thomas and Gorsuch are, like the rest of the justices from both parties, outcome determinative. But in this case, the outcome these two value most is power, not the health of the American economy. If Trump wants to use that power to crash the economy, that’s his problem, not Thomas’s or Gorsuch’s (according to them).\n\nColumn\n\n /\n\n Kate Wagner\n\nStudentNation\n\n /\n\n Colin Warren\n\nEric Blanc, Wes McEnany, and Claire Sandberg\n\nBooks & the Arts\n\n /\n\n Benjamin R. Barber\n\nStill, they were in the minority. Ultimately, Roberts does not want Trump to have personal control over the Fed, so Trump won’t have it. I also don’t think Roberts wants Trump to be able to impose retaliatory tariffs, so Trump likely won’t have that power either. Roberts does want Trump to be able to kill the NLRB and USAID, so he can. I don’t yet know if Roberts wants Trump to be able to end birthright citizenship, but I guess I’ll find out soon.\n\nI wish Roberts thought immigrants and white ladies in Minnesota were as important as the Federal Reserve. I wish Roberts thought protecting American schoolchildren was as important as protecting American investments. I wish Roberts thought discriminating against a Black woman working at Publix was as important as discriminating against a Black woman working for the Fed. But… he doesn’t.\n\nTrump will lose this case because he’s trying to mess with something the Supreme Court thinks is important. I wish we all could be so lucky as to appear valuable to John Roberts and the Supreme Court.",

    "description": "The Supreme Court heard arguments over Trump's efforts to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook. The case has broad implications for the economy.",
    "fullText": "Eight of the nine Supreme Court justices expressed wariness with what Justice Samuel Alito described as a \"hurried\" attempt from the Trump administration to oust Lisa Cook from her position as a Federal Reserve board governor — and then to rush her case to the high court when lower courts allowed her to keep her post.\n\nSeveral members of the Republican-appointed majority also expressed sharp disagreement with the Trump administration's claim that judges lack the authority to review a president's power to fire members from the Federal Reserve board.\n\n\"Your position that there's no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause, that the president alone determines — and that would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, told Solicitor General John Sauer.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision could have broad ramifications for Federal Reserve independence, a cornerstone of American monetary policy and the status of the dollar as the world's reserve currency.\n\nThe hearing comes just weeks after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell revealed that the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into his handling of the Fed's office renovations. Powell has said the investigation is a \"pretext\" for an attempt to pressure the central bank for political reasons.\n\nPowell attended Wednesday's oral arguments, along with Cook and former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke.\n\nMembers of the Federal Reserve's board of governors can only be removed for \"cause.\" Trump attempted to fire Cook in August, alleging she had lied on mortgage paperwork and therefore could not be trusted with her role in the Fed, which sets interest rates that influence mortgage lending rates.\n\nCook — an appointee of former President Joe Biden whose Federal Reserve board term ends in 2038 — argued that Trump's real intent was to replace her with an appointee who would more quickly drive down interest rates. Trump did not give Cook an opportunity to explain the apparent discrepancies in her mortgage paperwork before he posted the letter firing her on his Truth Social account.\n\nWednesday's oral argument didn't concern the merits of Trump's allegations about Cook's mortgage paperwork, but whether the judicial branch had the power to ensure Cook could keep her job while additional litigation plays out.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts — in a sentiment echoed by every other member of the Supreme Court except for Justice Clarence Thomas — expressed skepticism at the idea that the judicial branch couldn't have a role in checking the legitimacy of a \"for cause\" firing.\n\n\"If there is any level of cause — and you indicate that there is some level of cause, right? — well, then you can't be right about the idea that a court can't order anybody who's been removed to be reinstated,\" Roberts told Sauer.\n\nKavanaugh, while pressing Sauer, suggested that the Trump administration's position effectively erased the distinction between \"for cause\" and \"at-will\" firing — a notion that all of the Democratic appointees on the court also appeared to agree with.\n\nThe Trump administration's position may open the door for a Democratic president to fire all of Trump's Federal Reserve board appointees using \"trivial or inconsequential or old allegations,\" Kavanaugh said.\n\n\"It incentivizes kind of the 'search-and-destroy and find something, and just put that on a piece of paper — no judicial review, no process, nothing, you're done,'\" Kavanaugh said.\n\nAlito asked about why Cook had to be fired and the lawsuit against her handled in a \"cursory manner.\" He asked Sauer whether Cook's mortgage application had even been entered into evidence in the case.\n\nSauer said he wasn't sure if the paperwork itself had been seen by the district court judge who allowed Cook to keep her job, but that screenshots of the text of her mortgage application were included in social media posts.\n\n\"Is there any reason why this whole matter had to be handled by everybody — by the executive branch, by the district court, by the DC Circuit — in such a hurried manner?\" Alito asked. \"You began by laying out what you claim to be the factual basis for the for cause removal, but no court has ever explored those facts.\"\n\nAmy Coney Barrett, another Trump appointee, expressed anxiety about whether removing Cook could risk a recession, as economists have warned.\n\nShe wondered whether a dispute over mortgage paperwork was severe enough grounds to fire Cook, and why Trump didn't make an effort to give her the opportunity to respond to his allegations.\n\n\"Sit down across the table in the Roosevelt room where the president provides Governor Cook with the evidence and waits to hear what her response is, gives her a chance to defend herself,\" Barrett said. \"I mean, that just wouldn't be that big a deal.\"\n\nAfter Sauer finished addressing the justices' questions, Cook's lawyer Paul Clement took the podium. He said Sauer's approach effectively erased the \"for cause\" standard required for firing members of the Fed.\n\n\"If there's no judicial review, then this is all kind of a joke,\" Clement said.\n\nThis is a developing story.

    "description": "Federal Reserve Gov. Lisa Cook was at the center of Donald Trump's pressure campaign until Jerome Powell said he was under investigation.",
    "fullText": "Federal Reserve Gov. Lisa Cook's future was already set before the Supreme Court. Then the Justice Department sent subpoenas to the central bank.\n\nWith a criminal investigation hanging over the Fed, Wednesday's oral arguments are shaping up to be a prelude to a potential historic ruling.\n\nThe White House has said it had no role in the subpoenas. While Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who is expected to be in attendance, has portrayed the investigation as part of a retribution campaign — an argument Cook herself made when Trump tried to fire her in August 2025.\n\nHere's how Cook found herself at the center of a legal showdown with Trump.\n\nLisa DeNell Cook was born in 1964 in Milledgeville, Georgia. Her father, Payton B. Cook, was a chaplain at Central State Hospital. Mary Murray Cook, her mother, was a nurse and the first African-American tenured faculty member at Georgia College and State University.\n\nCook and her sisters were among the first Black students to integrate into local schools. She has said she has scars from when students beat her.\n\n\"I still have scars from that — scar where hair won't grow in my eyebrow and a scar on my leg from having been beaten during that period, during the period of desegregation,\" Cook told NPR in 2020.\n\nThe Civil Rights movement runs throughout Cook's family. Cook's cousin, Floyd McKissick Sr., helped organize the March on Washington.\n\nHer uncle, Samuel DuBois Cook, was a classmate of Martin Luther King Jr. at Morehouse College. In 1966, DuBois Cook became the first Black professor to hold a regular appointment at a white Southern university when he accepted a position at Duke, according to the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford.\n\n\"He instilled in me the deep belief of the Civil Rights Movement that with faith, preparation, and great effort, things could and would be better,\" Cook said, praising her uncle and a host of relatives in April 2024 when she accepted a lifetime achievement award from the Duke University center that bears her uncle's name.\n\nIn 1986, Cook graduated with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and physics from Spelman College, a historically Black, all-women's university. While at Spelman, Cook became the first Spelman student to win the prestigious Marshall Scholarship.\n\nTwo years later, Cook added a BA in philosophy, politics, and economics from the University of Oxford. Cook also studied at the Université Cheikh Anta Diop in Dakar, Senegal. In 2020, she told Finance & Development, the International Monetary Fund's magazine, that a chance encounter while studying in Senegal pushed her into the field of economics.\n\nShe later earned her Ph.D. in economics from the University of California, Berkeley. Her dissertation was on \"External and Internal Credit Markets in Tsarist and Post-Soviet Russia.\"\n\nIn 2022, President Joe Biden nominated Cook to the Federal Reserve. At the time, Democrats narrowly controlled the US Senate. While Federal Reserve nominees are often confirmed with broad, bipartisan support, Cook's nomination faced significant opposition.\n\nSen. Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania who at the time was the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, said she was \"grossly unqualified\" to serve on the central bank due to her lack of monetary policy experience.\n\n\"Professor Cook's record indicates that she is likely to inject further political bias into the Fed's work — at a time when we need the Fed focused on fighting inflation,\" Toomey said.\n\nThen-Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, who led the Senate Banking Committee, said that Cook was \"extremely qualified.\"\n\n\"A small but loud minority have wrongly claimed that Lisa Cook doesn't meet the standards for this position — standards that only seem to apply for certain nominees,\" Brown said in 2022. \"Still, she has met and exceeded all of those high bars: she's a Ph.D. economist, she is a tenured professor, and she is sought by organizations around the world for her input and perspective.\"\n\nOn May 10, 2022, Vice President Kamala Harris cast the tie-breaking vote to confirm Cook. Soon after, Cook became the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve Board in its over 100-year history. She continues to hold this distinction.\n\nIn May 2023, Biden renominated Cook for a full term that lasts until 2038. She was reconfirmed by a 51-47 vote.\n\nIn August 2025, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte made a criminal referral to the Justice Department. In a letter to the DOJ, Pulte said he took allegations of mortgage fraud \"very seriously.\" An outspoken critic of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Pulte has repeatedly said that his investigation into Cook is not connected to his criticism of the central bank.\n\nOn August 20, Trump called on Cook to resign. Five days later, Trump publicly posted a letter to Cook saying that he was firing her — the first time in history a president had tried to fire a member of the central bank.\n\nPulte said that Cook indicated that two separate properties she purchased around the same time were both her primary residence. In his letter, Trump cited the allegations as sufficient reason to fire Cook for cause. In a legal filing, Cook's attorneys explicitly denied that she ever committed mortgage fraud.\n\n\"Setting aside the fact that Governor Cook did not ever commit mortgage fraud, any such pre-office offense plainly would not have been 'so infamous a nature, as to render the offender unfit to execute any public franchise,'\" the attorneys wrote in a filing earlier this month.\n\nCook's lawyers have also said that the president did not give her sufficient time to respond to Pulte's allegations before her attempted firing.\n\nOn September 9, US District Judge Jia Cobb moved to grant Cook's request to temporarily block Trump's firing.\n\n\"The best reading of the 'for cause' provision is that the bases for removal of a member of the Board of Governors are limited to grounds concerning a Governor's behavior in office and whether they have been faithfully and effectively executing their statutory duties,\" Cobb wrote.\n\nThe Justice Department appealed the ruling, seeking to immediately remove Cook as the case continues to unfold. The Supreme Court ruled in October that Cook can remain on the job, pending oral arguments.\n\n\"The Court's decision rightly allows Governor Cook to continue in her role on the Federal Reserve Board, and we look forward to further proceedings consistent with the Court's order,\" Cook's lawyers Abbe Lowell and Norm Eisen said in a statement.\n\nTrump still could win the final battle after justices hear the case next year, a position the White House holds.\n\n\"President Trump lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"We look forward to ultimate victory after presenting our oral arguments before the Supreme Court in January.\"\n\nThe Fed initially tried to stay out of the dispute. A lawyer for the central bank wrote in a court filing in August that it simply wanted a quick resolution.\n\n\"At this time, the Board merely expresses (1) its interest in a prompt ruling by this Court to remove the existing cloud of uncertainty; and (2) its intent to follow any order this Court issues,\" Joshua P. Chadwick, assistant general counsel for the Fed, said in a court filing.\n\nCook continued to participate in Fed meetings before her case reached the justices, including casting votes on interest rate cuts. Cook's lawyers pointed out that she will likely participate in at least one more Federal Open Market Committee before the Supreme Court issues its ruling.\n\n\"That the status quo has been maintained for months without any apparent problem only confirms that the public interest favors allowing Governor Cook to retain her office while this suit proceeds,\" Cook's attorneys wrote in a November filing.",

    "description": "The Fed's independence is being tested. Here's what SCOTUS justices could say on Wednesday about Trump's efforts to fire Fed board member Lisa Cook.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday is scheduled to hear arguments over President Donald Trump's attempts to fire a sitting Federal Reserve board member.\n\nLisa Cook, whom Trump tried to remove in August, has asked the high court to ensure she can keep her job. She's argued that the \"cause\" Trump cited, which involves allegations of mortgage irregularities, is a pretext. The efforts to fire her are based on politics, not economic data or job performance, her lawyers say.\n\nThe case has broad implications for the central bank's independence at a critical moment. Last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell accused Trump's Justice Department of an unprecedented attempt to pressure him with what he described as a sham criminal probe.\n\nAs Powell continues to battle what he has described as improper political interference, the Cook case tests a separate but related legal question: Can the president of the United States unseat a sitting Fed governor for any reason?\n\nJosh Chafetz, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown Law School, predicted the criminal investigation into Powell could make the Supreme Court justices more inclined to \"put the brakes\" on Trump's efforts to pressure the Fed.\n\n\"John Roberts doesn't want to throw the global economy into turmoil,\" Chafetz said, referring to the chief justice.\n\nOver the past year, the Supreme Court has greenlit Trump's firing of other independent agency leaders. At the same time, the majority of justices have said they would treat the Federal Reserve with special deference.\n\nIn Wednesday's oral arguments, we'll learn more about just how special the Fed really is.\n\nThe Federal Reserve — like the Federal Trade Commission and National Labor Relations Board — was created by Congress as an independent agency, structured to insulate its members from political winds. Presidents appoint board members for staggered 14-year terms. Cook, a Biden appointee, has until 2038 before her term expires.\n\nOver the years, the Supreme Court has chipped away at the independence of similarly constructed agencies.\n\nIn 2020, it ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent agency with a single director, could have its leader fired by the president \"at will\" — meaning for any reason whatsoever — rather than \"for cause.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court has suggested it may soon allow \"at will\" firings of leaders of independent agencies led by multi-member boards, too. In December, it heard oral arguments for a lawsuit brought by Rebecca Slaughter, who Trump fired from the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nTrump's letter firing Slaughter didn't identify any cause, even though the Supreme Court has previously said presidents need to meet that standard to remove FTC commissioners. And unlike Cook, the Supreme Court has allowed Slaughter to be removed from her post while additional legal proceedings play out.\n\nThe Supreme Court hasn't yet issued a final ruling in Slaughter's case. But during oral arguments in December, several Republican-appointed justices indicated they could deal a death blow to a 90-year-old case that recognized limits to the president's ability to fire members of independent agencies. The landmark unanimous ruling said agencies like the FTC were \"quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative,\" a structure intended to safeguard them from \"political domination.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts referred to the 1935 opinion, known as Humphrey's Executor, as \"a dried husk.\" Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett both asked Slaughter's lawyer if he could cite different Supreme Court precedents that would allow her to keep her job.\n\nDuring the past year's legal battles between the Trump administration and independent agency leaders, the justices have gone out of their way to single out the independence of the Federal Reserve.\n\nIn May, a majority of justices allowed Trump to remove members from two independent agencies — the Merit Systems Protection Board and National Labor Relations Board — but said the Federal Reserve's \"for cause removal protections\" would need to be considered with its \"distinct historical tradition\" in mind.\n\n\"The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,\" the justices wrote in an unsigned opinion.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh took pains during oral arguments in the Slaughter case to indicate that he was inclined to give the Federal Reserve special treatment.\n\nWhile questioning Solicitor General John Sauer, Kavanaugh asked about drawing \"a principled, sensible line\" that would distinguish the Federal Reserve from other agencies.\n\n\"The other side says that your position would undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve and they have concerns about that, and I share those concerns,\" Kavanaugh told Sauer.\n\nAlthough most Americans don't interact with the Fed directly, its policies affect their everyday lives. By controlling the direction of interest rates, the central bank determines the cost of borrowing and returns on savings. The Fed and its independence are the cornerstones of the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency.\n\nTo hear Cook's lawyers and prominent economists tell it, the potential damage is extraordinarily high. If Trump can fire her, then the door is open for future presidents to steamroll the Fed and cause economic chaos, they say.\n\n\"We can think about the Cook removal as seeking a roadmap from the court for how to potentially remove other governors, including Jerome Powell,\" said Lev Menand, a professor of administrative law and financial institutions at Columbia Law School.\n\nIn his attempt to fire Cook, Trump cited a criminal referral from Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who said Cook lied on mortgage forms.\n\nThat apparent deceitfulness, according to Trump, made Cook ill-suited for her role in setting interest rates.\n\nThere is no public indication that, in the months since Pulte's letter, the Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into Cook's mortgage paperwork.\n\nThe Trump administration has maintained that the president can fire a Federal Reserve board member for any reason and that courts don't have the power to second-guess any \"for cause\" justifications.\n\nCook's attorneys argue that such freedom defeats the entire purpose of \"for cause\" limitations, turning Fed board members into \"at will\" government employees. They also say that \"for cause\" justifications can only involve conduct during Cook's service — not years-old mortgage paperwork.\n\n​​With the Powell investigation \"hovering\" over the Cook case, the justices may be more wary of giving Trump the flexibility he wants to get rid of Cook, Chafetz said.\n\n\"If the president gets to define anything as 'cause,' and that's completely unreviewable, then that is serving at the pleasure of the president,\" Chafetz said.",

    "title": "The Supreme Court Just Decided a Major Issue in Cases Like Renee Good’s Shooting—and Not How You Might Expect",
    "description": "Last week, Jonathan Ross fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, a white mother of three, while she was in her SUV.",
    "fullText": "After federal agents killed an unarmed American citizen in broad daylight last week, high-ranking government officials rushed to defend the shooter, framed a mother’s attempt to escape an escalating confrontation as “domestic terrorism,” and blamed the victim for her own death. The killing of Renee Good is not just a failure of policing—the public response by those in power should alarm every American who believes that being frightened by armed agents and trying to drive away should not be a capital offense. Indeed, recent Supreme Court precedent illuminates why the shooting of Good by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross is not the case of self-defense that administration officials are suggesting. The totality of events—which has been the standard established by the court since 1989 and was reaffirmed just last year—suggests that it was not reasonable for Ross to shoot Good in the head as she was attempting to drive away from ICE agents trying to forcibly remove her from her car.\n\nLast week, Ross fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, a white mother of three, while she was in her SUV, apparently attempting to leave a situation that was becoming increasingly hostile. In cellphone video of the incident, we can see two ICE agents exit a pickup truck and approach Good’s car. As one agent appears to reach through the driver’s open window and tries to open the door, Good slowly reverses, then turns towards the right and drives forward slowly, attempting to leave. At that moment, a third officer, who is standing in front of Good’s car, unholsters his gun and, while moving to the side of the vehicle, fires several shots inside, striking Good in the head. The car continues to move forward and crashes into a parked car. Good was pronounced dead shortly after.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the agent who shot Good, saying, “This was an act of domestic terrorism. ICE officers got stuck in the snow and were attempting to push out their vehicle when a woman attacked them.” President Donald Trump also weighed in immediately after the killing, writing on Truth Social, “The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense.” None of the videos that have emerged from the shooting show Good running over the agent or attacking agents prior to her death.\n\nGood was a U.S. citizen, and DHS has stated she was not a target of an ICE investigation. She was shot just blocks from her home.\n\nAnother video of the incident follows what happened before the agents approached Good’s SUV. In the video, Good extends her arm from the open driver’s window and makes the “Go ahead” signal to a pickup truck that has just pulled up and stopped a few feet from her car, right before ICE agents exited the vehicle. The footage suggests that Good was not attempting to block agents with her car, as some have claimed.\n\nA third video, taken from the cellphone of the agent who shot Good, features a smiling Good, with her car window rolled down, saying, “That’s fine, dude. I’m not mad at you.” It also shows a woman, later identified as Becca Good, Good’s wife, outside the car, filming the ICE agent. As the agent is filming the license plate of their car, Becca says, “That’s OK, we don’t change our plates every morning, just so you know. It’ll be the same plate when you come talk to us later.” A few seconds later, two agents approach the SUV, one trying to open the driver’s-side door, while yelling, “Get out of the fucking car!” Possibly frightened at what appears to be a hostile situation, Good puts the car in reverse, then drives forward. The camera suddenly points towards the sky, and we hear a thud. Three shots ring out, one immediately after the other. After that, we hear a male voice saying, “Fucking bitch.”\n\nThe government has claimed that the agent who shot Good was in fear for his life and was acting in self-defense. The videos illustrate something else: an avoidable tragedy. Again, recent Supreme Court precedent helps explain why.\n\nIn assessing whether a law enforcement agent’s use of deadly force was reasonable or excessive, the court this past summer rejected the 5th Circuit’s narrow “moment of threat” doctrine—which stated that the only thing that matters in determining whether an officer reasonably fears for their life in a use-of-force situation is the moment of the shooting itself—as inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment. The court, in Barnes v. Felix, rejected this narrow time-framing approach and repeated what it had held in Graham v. Connor: In assessing the reasonableness of an officer’s use of force, one must consider the totality of circumstances.\n\nMany of those defending the shooting appear to be focusing on the moment just before he fired the first shot. Applying a moment-of-threat approach to this shooting would require one to freeze-frame the video at the moment the officer was standing in front of Good’s car and saw it inching forward. Under such a cramped view of the incident, one might conclude that in that moment, the officer feared for his life and therefore needed to shoot to defend himself.\n\nIn contrast, if we broaden the time frame and consider that the agent put himself in front of the vehicle, that a smiling Good had, seconds earlier, told the agent, “That’s fine, dude, I’m not mad at you” and started to move her car forward only after other agents approached her vehicle, with one reaching in through the open window, trying to open the driver’s side door, and screaming for her to get out of the “fucking car,” the claim that the agent needed to shoot Good to save his life seems less plausible. That the agent was able to stay on his two feet, move to the side of the car, and fire two shots into the open driver’s-side window as Good was turning the SUV to the right and trying to drive away further undermines the claim that he acted in self-defense to neutralize an imminent threat to his life. The videos suggest that Good was simply trying to leave what was becoming an increasingly hostile situation, not purposely trying to hit the ICE agent who had dangerously put himself in front of her car.\n\nOne question the court left open in Barnes was whether it is appropriate to consider prior conduct of law enforcement that increases the risk of an encounter with a civilian turning deadly—something many have called “officer-created jeopardy.” It seems obvious that if one is applying a totality-of-the-circumstances approach, then prior conduct of law enforcement that increases the risk that the encounter will turn deadly is just part of the totality of the circumstances and ought to be part of the inquiry.\n\nSome have pointed out that putting oneself in front of a moving vehicle is not considered a wise police practice. Similarly, shooting into a moving vehicle is not considered a good police practice unless necessary to stop an armed or dangerous felon (neither of which accurately describes Good), because of the risk of injury to the occupant of the vehicle and nearby bystanders. Although the first shot appears to have gone through the car’s front windshield, the second and third shots seem to have been fired by the agent at Good’s head through the open driver’s-side window as she was trying to leave. The officer by that time was firing from the side of the vehicle, not shooting someone trying to run him over as has been claimed. If he simply wanted to stop the vehicle from escaping, why did he aim at the driver’s head rather than the tires of the SUV?\n\nIn discussing the shooting, Noem said, “Any loss of life is a tragedy, and I think all of us can agree that, in this situation, it was preventable,” suggesting it was Good’s own fault that she had been shot. Similarly, Vice President J.D. Vance has said that Good’s death was “a tragedy of her own making.” With these comments, Noem, Vance, and others defending the officer posit that if Good had simply followed orders and gotten out of the car, none of this would have happened.\n\nIronically, Good’s death was completely preventable, not because Good failed to comply with the order to exit her car but because the officer could have exercised restraint and refrained from shooting her. He had taken a video of her license plate number, so if the agency wanted to track her down, it could have done so later. When the agent fired two shots into the open driver’s-side window from the side of Good’s car, Good was not posing an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to him or any other agent. Good was not a violent felon trying to flee the scene of a crime. She was just trying to get home to her three kids in one piece.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court sided with Montana police on Wednesday in a case over when officers can enter a home without a warrant if an emergency might be unfolding inside.\n\nThe unanimous high court found officers acted lawfully when they went into the home of William Case, who was shot and wounded after officers entered his home in 2021.\n\nPolice were responding to a call from Case's former girlfriend, who feared he might have killed himself. They entered his home after knocking on the door produced no response. An officer fired after Case threw open a closet curtain while holding an object that looked like a gun, according to court documents. A handgun was later found in a nearby laundry basket.\n\nCase was charged with assaulting an officer but argued that the evidence against him should be tossed out because officers didn’t have a warrant.\n\nThe Montana Supreme Court disagreed, finding that the officers needed only to reasonably suspect someone required emergency help. Case appealed to the justices and asked them to require a higher probable cause standard, similar to criminal investigations.\n\nThe justices rejected that argument. They found that the standard set by the state's highest court was too low but that the Montana officers' actions were nevertheless “objectively reasonable” under a standard set in a previous Supreme Court case.\n\nThe opinion written by Justice Elena Kagan noted that entering during an emergency doesn't allow police to search beyond what's needed to help and keep officers safe.\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court.",

    "fullText": "Judges rarely complain openly about the Supreme Court, for the same reason that most people do not publicly chastise their bosses. Attacking your boss is a good way to ensure that your own work will be discounted — or worse.\n\nSo it’s remarkable just how many judges have published opinions criticizing the Supreme Court’s decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n v. Bruen (2022), a decision by all six of the Court’s Republicans that instructs lower court judges on how they should handle Second Amendment cases.\n\nOr, at least, Bruen purports to provide lower courts with this kind of guidance. As one federal judge complained in a 2023 opinion, the “unique test” the Republican justices came up with in Bruen “does not provide lower courts with clear guidance.” Courts, a different federal appellate judge wrote, “are struggling at every stage of the Bruen inquiry.”\n\nIndeed, in her concurring opinion in United States v. Rahimi (2024), the Supreme Court’s only attempt to interpret Bruen since that decision was handed down, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson quoted a dozen different judicial opinions complaining that Bruen simply does not work. One Trump appointee protested Bruen’s “inconsistent and amorphous standard” and warned that it “created mountains of work for district courts that must now deal with Bruen-related arguments in nearly every criminal case in which a firearm is found”\n\nBriefly, Bruen held that for nearly any gun law to survive a constitutional challenge, “the government must demonstrate that the regulation is consistent with this Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.” To meet this burden, government lawyers must show that the modern-day gun law they are defending is sufficiently similar to “analogous regulations” that existed when the Constitution was framed.\n\nAnd just how “analogous” must these long-forgotten laws be? As the dozen judges quoted by Justice Jackson show, no one really knows. In 2020, the federal government alone charged more than 14,000 defendants with firearm-related crimes. Thanks to Bruen, every single one of those cases can descend into a Mad Hatter–like inquiry into how a raven resembles a writing desk.\n\nWhich brings us to Wolford v. Lopez, the first of two Second Amendment cases that the Court plans to hear in its current term. Wolford, which the justices will hear on January 20, is poised to be the Court’s second-ever decision explaining what the hell Bruen means.\n\nA humbler Court would recognize that Bruen is a failure and overrule that decision — prior to Bruen, every federal appeals court used a two-step framework (which I explain in more detail here) to analyze Second Amendment cases. The Court could simply restore this framework, which worked perfectly well and did not create the same confusion among judges.\n\nBut that outcome is unlikely. Historical analysis is currently fashionable among Republican judges, many of whom identify with originalism — an approach to constitutional cases which fixates on how words were understood more than 200 years ago. In Bruen, the Republican justices attempted to build a framework for interpreting an entire constitutional amendment that is grounded in originalism. Overruling Bruen means admitting that this originalist project failed.\n\nStill, the Wolford case should give pro-gun Republicans pause for an unexpected reason: The biggest advantage the lawyers defending a Hawaii gun law have on their side is the Court’s cockamamie reasoning in Bruen.\n\nThe plaintiffs in Wolford, three gun owners and a pro-gun advocacy group, challenge a fairly clever Hawaii law that appears to be designed to undermine the result the Court reached in Bruen.\n\nBruen struck down a 108-year-old New York state law that required anyone who wanted to carry a handgun in public to demonstrate “proper cause” before they could obtain a license allowing them to do so. The Hawaii law at issue in Wolford imposes similarly strict restrictions on public carry through a different means. It makes it a crime to bring a gun onto private property “unless the person has been given express authorization to carry a firearm on the property by the owner, lessee, operator, or manager of the property.”\n\nThus, the practical effect of Hawaii’s law is to remove guns from most shops, hotels, restaurants, and other places of business. Most business owners aren’t going to put out a sign announcing that guns are allowed inside. And few gun owners are likely to enter such a business without their firearm, track down the manager, obtain permission to bring their gun inside, and then go retrieve the weapon.\n\nIf Bruen were a coherent decision that applied normal legal reasoning, in other words, the Wolford plaintiffs would have a fairly clear cut case. Typically, the Supreme Court does not allow states to bypass its decisions by concocting Rube Goldberg–like devices to achieve ends that the Court has already determined are unconstitutional.\n\nAnd yet, somewhat ironically, the best thing that Hawaii’s lawyers have going for them in Wolford is the nonsensical historical framework laid out in Bruen.\n\nIn their brief to the justices, Hawaii’s lawyers identify various colonial and early American state laws that closely resemble the Hawaii statute forbidding gun owners to bring their weapons onto private land without the landowner’s permission.\n\nThis list includes a 1771 New Jersey law barring someone from bringing “any gun on any Lands not his own, and for which the owner pays taxes, or is in his lawful possession, unless he has license or permission in writing from the owner.” It also includes a similar 1721 Pennsylvania law preventing someone from hunting or bringing a gun onto another person’s land without “Lisence [sic] or Permission from the Owner of any such Lands or Plantation,” and a 1763 New York law making it unlawful to carry a gun on “inclosed Land” without “License in Writing first had and obtained for that Purpose from such Owner, Proprietor, or Possessor.”\n\nIt appears, in other words, that Americans around the time of the nation’s founding and the ratification of the Second Amendment were quite comfortable with laws banning gun possession on private land without the land owner’s permission. That should be enough to uphold Hawaii’s law under Bruen’s “historical tradition of firearm regulation” standard. But it’s not that simple.\n\nWolford should be an awkward case for the Court’s Republicans, because the largely pro-gun framework they announced in Bruen doesn’t actually point to a pro-gun result in this case. Realistically, however, the Bruen framework is sufficiently malleable that these justices can reach whatever result they want in Wolford.\n\nConsider, for example, Rahimi, the only post-Bruen case the Court has handed down interpreting that decision.\n\nRahimi involved a cartoonishly violent individual who, when the Court decided this case, was accused of committing six different shooting crimes — that is, crimes where he actually discharged a firearm. In one of these incidents, he allegedly fired his gun at a bystander who witnessed him beating the mother of his child. A majority of the justices voted to uphold his conviction under a federal law that prohibits many people who are subject to domestic violence restraining orders from possessing a gun.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the majority opinion in Rahimi, primarily reasoned that this federal law was sufficiently similar to Founding Era laws that required individuals who were believed to be likely to engage in violence to post a bond, which they would forfeit if they “broke the peace.”\n\nIn dissent, meanwhile, Justice Clarence Thomas argued that these bond-posting laws were not sufficiently similar to the modern-day ban on carrying a gun while under a restraining order, because the Founding Era laws “imposed a far less onerous burden.” They neither disarmed individuals nor incarcerated them if they were later found with a gun.\n\nBecause Bruen’s “analogous regulations” test is so vague, both Roberts and Thomas made plausible arguments: Bruen didn’t fully explain just how similar a modern law must be to a colonial or early American law in order to survive judicial review. Indeed, if anything, Thomas had the stronger argument that the law in Rahimi should have been struck down under Bruen.\n\nBruen said that “when a challenged regulation addresses a general societal problem that has persisted since the 18th century, the lack of a distinctly similar historical regulation addressing that problem is relevant evidence that the challenged regulation is inconsistent with the Second Amendment.” Violence between romantic partners is a societal problem that existed well before the 18th century. But every state permitted married partners to beat their spouses until 1871, when the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that a husband and wife “may be indicted for assault and battery upon each other.”\n\nBruen, in other words, does not actually tell judges how to decide gun cases — as so many lower court judges have complained. It merely insists that they must tell a story about whether a modern law is similar to a very old law.\n\nIndeed, there is empirical evidence that Bruen gives judges broad leeway to decide gun cases however they choose. A 2023 paper by scholars Eric Ruben, Rosanna Smart, and Ali Rowhani-Rahbar indicates that “Bruen has not meaningfully constrained judges” and has instead freed them to decide gun cases according to their “judicial ideology.” The paper finds that “judges appointed by Republican presidents are 1.8 times as likely” to rule that a gun law violates Bruen “as judges appointed by Democratic presidents.”\n\nBruen, in other words, is not law. Rather than constraining how judges decide cases, it merely requires them to cite historical sources in an opinion that reaches whatever conclusion aligns with their politics. On a 6-3 Republican Supreme Court, that means that the Hawaii law at issue in Wolford is likely to fall.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has a warning about a potential loss on tariffs at the Supreme Court.\n\n\"If the Supreme Court rules against the United States of America on this National Security bonanza, WE'RE SCREWED,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday.\n\nThat warning, contained in the latest post in what's become a regular stream of Truth Social missives on the subject of tariffs and the Supreme Court, comes as observers await to see how the court rules.\n\nA decision could come as soon as Wednesday, though there's little indication of whether it will occur then, or at some other date in the coming weeks.\n\nThe court will rule on whether Trump can impose tariffs under a national security law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.\n\nMany of Trump's tariffs have been imposed under that law. Lower courts have found those tariffs to be illegal, and bettors on prediction market sites like Polymarket and Kalshi currently put the odds of a ruling against Trump at around 70%.\n\nIf that happens, the US may have to refund the billions of dollars in revenue that the government has collected from the IEEPA tariffs.\n\nTrump argued that the amount was worth \"Trillions of Dollars\" when accounting for investments that US companies have made to avoid tariffs.\n\n\"It would be a complete mess, and almost impossible for our Country to pay,\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's comments are at odds with what Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said about potential tariff refunds over the weekend, when he told Reuters that it \"won't be a problem if we have to do it.\"",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump issued a grave warning on Monday, warning that “WE’RE SCREWED” if the Supreme Court strikes down the tariffs he’s unilaterally imposed on much of the rest of the world.\n\n“The actual numbers that we would have to pay back if, for any reason, the Supreme Court were to rule against the United States of America on Tariffs, would be many Hundreds of Billions of Dollars, and that doesn’t include the amount of ‘payback’ that Countries and Companies would require for the Investments they are making on building Plants, Factories, and Equipment, for the purpose of being able to avoid the payment of Tariffs,” declared Trump in a post on Truth Social.\n\n“When these Investments are added, we are talking about Trillions of Dollars! It would be a complete mess, and almost impossible for our Country to pay. Anybody who says that it can be quickly and easily done would be making a false, inaccurate, or totally misunderstood answer to this very large and complex question. It may not be possible but, if it were, it would be Dollars that would be so large that it would take many years to figure out what number we are talking about and even, who, when, and where, to pay,” he continued. “Remember, when America shines brightly, the World shines brightly. In other words, if the Supreme Court rules against the United States of America on this National Security bonanza, WE’RE SCREWED!”\n\nThe Court’s ruling on the matter is expected to be released in the near future, and possibly even this Wednesday.\n\nAfter the Department of Commerce released figures last month indicating that the economy had grown at an impressive annualized rate of 4.3% between last July and September, Trump credited his trade policy.\n\n“The TARIFFS are responsible for the GREAT USA Economic Numbers JUST ANNOUNCED…AND THEY WILL ONLY GET BETTER!” he argued at the time. “Also, NO INFLATION & GREAT NATIONAL SECURITY. Pray for the U.S. Supreme Court!!!”\n\nThe Court heard the case, which challenges Trump’s authority to levy the import taxes without congressional action, in November. During oral arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts characterized the tariffs as “taxes on Americans” in a moment that some court-watchers believed portended poorly for the administration.\n\nThe post ‘WE’RE SCREWED’: Trump Issues Grave Warning About Supreme Court Striking Down Tariff ‘Bonanza’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "The Supreme Court on Monday declined to review a $2.4 billion bankruptcy settlement for the Boy Scouts of America, rejecting an appeal from a group of childhood sex-abuse victims who said the deal unlawfully blocked them from suing groups that ran local scouting programs.\n\nThe group of victims – 75 people out of more than 82,000 who filed claims against the Boy Scouts – argued that the justices should have reopened the settlement in light of its decision last year in a similar legal dispute in involving Purdue Pharma, the maker of the opioid pain mediciation OxyContin. In that case, a 5-4 majority rejected a bankruptcy agreement that would have shielded the Sackler family from future lawsuits even though it made its fortune running the company.\n\nIn the Boy Scouts case, some of the victims want to be able to sue independent councils that ran local scouting programs and third-party organizations, such as churches and civic groups, that supported the programs. Those third-party groups contributed billions of dollars to a settlement trust for victims and, under the agreement, are shielded from future civil lawsuits.\n\nCritics of such arrangements say courts are generally not authorized to block such lawsuits. Supporters say that without protections for third-party groups, major bankruptcy deals like the ones for Purdue and the Boy Scouts would never take effect.\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America filed for bankruptcy in 2020 after spending more than $150 million to settle hundreds of abuse lawsuits between 2017 and 2019, according to court records. In 2022, a federal bankruptcy court in Delaware approved the reorganization plan, clearing the way for the Boy Scouts of America to reemerge and creating a fund to pay victims.\n\nLower courts, including the 3rd US Circuit Court Appeals, upheld the settlement agreement. The Lujan claimants appealed to the Supreme Court in October. The Supreme Court in early 2024 rejected an emergency appeal from the same group of victims.\n\nThough the Supreme Court did not explain its reasoning, the decision leaves in a place an appeals court decision that found that the way the Boy Scouts deal was structured largely shielded it from review by appellate courts.",

    "fullText": "On Jan. 7, the U.S. Supreme Court deferred ruling on the litigation challenging President Donald Trump's global tariffs\n\nThe new date for the next ruling is set for Jan. 14.\n\nWhen Trump announced sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs targeting countries across the world on Apr. 2, 2025, a day he dubbed \"Liberation Day,\" he invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).\n\nThe administration had argued that trade deficits constituted a national emergency and the president didn't need to consult with Congress to levy global tariffs.\n\nSeveral businesses affected by the decision and 12 U.S. states, mostly Democratic-governed, then went to the Supreme Court to challenge Trump's tariffs.\n\nIf the court rules that the president was wrong in invoking the emergency powers, the Trump administration will have to reimburse importers who already have paid the duties. The reimbursement is estimated to be more than $133.5 billion as per a Reuters report.\n\nBut the administration could get away with only limited repayments if the court decides to grant limited powers to the president under IEEPA.\n\nThe court's decision carries far-reaching implications for not only the global economy but also the crypto market.\n\nThe digital assets market got increasingly tied to Wall Street last year and Trump's tariff announcements frequently rattled the markets throughout 2025.\n\nIn fact, it was Trump's threat to hike tariffs on China on Oct. 10 last year that triggered the crypto flash crash in which more than $19 billion got wiped out in a day.\n\nWealthy trader moves millions ahead of Trump’s ‘big’ economic speech\n\nMysterious trader bets millions ahead of the Fed’s big announcement\n\nMysterious traders are selling ahead of Trump's 9PM address to the nation\n\nAhead of key policy announcements, mysterious crypto traders often place market orders and net millions of dollars.\n\nAs reported earlier, a trader made millions by shorting cryptocurrencies ahead of Trump's China announcement on Oct. 10.\n\nRecently, a crypto trader on Polymarket profited over $400,000 by betting on Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro's ouster.\n\nNotably, the trader had created his Polymarket account only a day earlier, triggering speculations of insider trading.\n\nOnce again, a crypto whale placed an order as markets buzzed with reports of a Supreme Court ruling expected on Jan. 9.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to issue its next rulings on January 14 as several major cases remain pending including the legality ​of President Donald Trump's sweeping global tariffs.\n\nThe court indicated on its website on Friday that ‌it could release decisions in argued cases when the justices take the bench during a scheduled sitting next Wednesday. The court ‌does not announce in advance what cases will be decided.\n\nThe justices issued one ruling on Friday in a criminal case.\n\nThe challenge to Trump's tariffs marks a major test of presidential powers as well as of the court's willingness to check some of the Republican president's far-reaching assertions of authority since he returned to ⁠office in January 2025. The outcome ‌will also impact the global economy.\n\nDuring arguments in the case heard by the court on November 5, conservative and liberal justices appeared to cast doubt on the ‍legality of the tariffs, which Trump imposed by invoking a 1977 law meant for use during national emergencies. Trump's administration is appealing rulings by lower courts that he overstepped his authority.\n\nTrump has said tariffs have made the United ​States stronger financially. In a social media post on January 2, Trump said a Supreme Court ‌ruling against the tariffs would be a \"terrible blow\" to the United States.\n\nTrump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs on goods imported from individual countries - nearly every foreign trading partner - to address what he called a national emergency related to U.S. trade deficits. He invoked the same law to impose tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, citing the trafficking of the often-abused painkiller fentanyl ⁠and illicit drugs into the United States as a national ​emergency.\n\nThe challenges to the tariffs in the cases before the ​Supreme Court were brought by businesses affected by the tariffs and 12 U.S. states, most of them Democratic-governed.\n\nOther important cases are also awaiting rulings at the court, which ‍has a 6-3 conservative majority, ⁠including a challenge to a key section of the Voting Rights Act, the landmark 1965 federal law enacted by Congress to prevent racial discrimination in voting.\n\nAnother involves a challenge on free ⁠speech grounds to a Colorado law banning psychotherapists from conducting \"conversion therapy\" that aims to change an LGBT minor's sexual orientation ‌or gender identity.",

    "description": "Nearly four years after the lawsuit was first filed, a key threshold question is moving toward a final answer.",
    "fullText": "Nearly four years after the lawsuit was first filed, a key threshold question is moving toward a final answer.\n\nThe NFL has filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court as to the question of whether the civil action filed in February 2022 by former Dolphins coach (and current Vikings defensive coordinator) Brian Flores against the NFL, the Dolphins, the Giants, the Broncos, and the Texans will be resolved in court, or in arbitration.\n\nThe specific legal question presented to the Supreme Court is this: \"Whether an arbitration agreement governing disputes in a professional sports league is categorically unenforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act because it designates the league commissioner as the default arbitrator and permits the commissioner to develop arbitral procedures.\"\n\nThe NFL has wisely narrowed the question, given that the reasoning (if applied throughout corporate America) would empower other companies to attempt to rig the in-house arbitration process by putting employment disputes in the hands of the CEO. Still, the league's position is clear — it wants the Commissioner to retain power over disputes involving the NFL and the various teams that have hired and that handsomely compensate the Commissioner.\n\nThe 25-page document is the first step in an effort to persuade the Supreme Court to take up the case. Of the many petitions it receives each year, few are accepted.\n\nMore time will pass as the Supreme Court considers whether to take the case. Even more time will pass if the Supreme Court grants the petition.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit invalidated the NFL's arbitration provision, concluding that the procedure lacks independence. (And it does.) The Supreme Court, if it takes the case, will decide once and for all whether it's legitimate for the NFL (and any sports league) to put its Commissioner in charge of claims made against the NFL.\n\nIt's fundamentally unfair to delegate those powers to someone whose connection to one side of a legal fight is so obvious. Frankly, no Commissioner should want to be expected to set aside their clear self-interests in an effort to dispense justice in an objective way.\n\nBut this has been the league's practice, for years. It desperately wants to run its own business. It desperately hopes to hold the gavel when it comes to deciding whether the legal claims against it are valid.\n\nIt's a bad way to do business. It's now for the Supreme Court to decide whether it's a good way, or a bad way, to apply the laws of the United States.",

The Daily Beast has reached out to the Supreme Court for comment.\n\nThe court’s favorability rating has plunged by 22 points over the past five years, from 70 percent in 2020 to a near-record low 48 percent late last year, the Pew Research Center reported in September.\n\nAnd although a vast majority of Americans, or 86 percent, think the justices should be non-partisan, 56 percent said the justices were doing only a fair or poor job of keeping their political views out of their legal decision-making.",

GOD BLESS AMERICA!”\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to rule in the coming weeks on whether to overturn a previous ruling that declared most of Trump’s sweeping global tariffs illegal.\n\nA lower federal appeals court found in August that the president had overstepped his authority when he cited a 1977 law—the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which is designed to address threats during a national emergency—to justify his reciprocal tariffs.\n\nWhile the conservative-majority Supreme Court, including three justices nominated by Trump, has largely ruled in the president’s favor in past cases, there are growing indications that the court may not back him this time and could strike down the tariffs.\n\nDuring a hearing in November, Trump-appointed Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch, as well as Chief Justice John Roberts, appeared skeptical of the president’s reasoning for imposing the tariffs.\n\nIf SCOTUS were to rule against Trump, it would not only be a major embarrassment for the president but could also trigger further economic turmoil, as countries may need to be reimbursed for the billions of dollars of funds collected under Trump’s tariff plans.\n\nTrump has posted multiple fear-mongering messages on Truth Social since the Supreme Court began hearing arguments in the case last year.\n\n“The U.S. Supreme Court was given the wrong numbers. The ‘unwind’ in the event of a negative decision on Tariffs would be, including investments made, to be made, and return of funds, in excess of 3 Trillion Dollars,” Trump wrote in a late-night November post. “It would not be possible to ever make up for that kind of a ‘drubbing.’”\n\nIn another desperate message on January 2, Trump added: “Tariffs are an overwhelming benefit to our Nation, as they have been incredible for our National Security and Prosperity (like nobody has ever seen before!). Losing our ability to Tariff other countries who treat us unfairly would be a terrible blow to the United States of America.”",

    "description": "The owner of the house and her family have four cars, so they spill slightly onto the lawn when parked—which is where the town takes issue.",
    "fullText": "Parking in a driveway is about as mundane as parking can get. It's not as fancy as in a garage. It's not as potentially dangerous as parking on a street. And yet, in this story, it's led to a six-figure fine that the Florida Supreme Court has decided to let stand after several years of litigation.\n\nWhile the state's Supreme Court didn't endorse the fine, according to CBS News, it declined to review the case of Sandy Martinez, a single mother who has spent several years fighting fines that have now ballooned to $165,000 and counting. Over $100,000 of those fines relate directly to Ms. Martinez parking her cars on her driveway and slightly onto her grass. Her home isn't home to her alone; her son, daughter, and sister all live with her. All four of them have full-time jobs, and each of them has their own car. The house itself is on a corner lot, so street parking isn't available. As such, they line their cars up across the four-car driveway.\n\nUnfortunately, one of the four cars always ends up having to park slightly onto the grass in the yard that Martinez owns. According to the city of Lantana, that's unacceptable, and as a result it has fined her $250 a day for over a year.\n\nThe Institute for Justice has stepped in, and is representing Martinez. “Six-figure fines for parking on your own property are shocking,” IJ senior attorney Ari Bargil told CBS News, following the court’s decision not to take up the case. “The court’s refusal to hear Sandy’s case is a disservice to all Floridians.”\n\nFor Martinez, options moving forward are extremely limited. CBS News says Florida's Homestead Protection Act shields her from foreclosure, but it's destroyed the equity she'd built up in her home. She can't retry the case in Florida either, and given the Supreme Court's ruling, it's unlikely that a federal court would hear the case.\n\nYou Need a Torque Wrench in Your Toolbox\n\nTested: Best Car Interior Cleaners",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a March presidential memorandum to revoke the security clearance of prominent Washington attorney Mark Zaid, ruling that the order — which also targeted 14 other individuals — could not be applied to him.\n\nThe decision marked the administration’s second legal setback on Tuesday, after the Supreme Court declined to allow Trump to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area, capping a first year in office in which President Donald Trump’s efforts to impose a sweeping agenda and pursue retribution against political adversaries have been repeatedly slowed by the courts.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amir Ali in Washington granted Zaid's request for a preliminary injunction, after he sued the Trump administration in May over the revocation of his security clearance. Zaid's request called it an act of “improper political retribution” that jeopardized his ability to continue representing clients in sensitive national security cases.\n\nThe March presidential memorandum singled out Zaid and 14 other individuals who the White House asserted were unsuitable to retain their clearances because it was “no longer in the national interest.” The list included targets of Trump’s fury from both the political and legal spheres, including former Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, New York Attorney General Letitia James, former President Joe Biden and members of his family.\n\nThe action was part of a much broader retribution campaign that Trump has waged since returning to the White House, including directing specific Justice Department investigations against perceived adversaries and issuing sweeping executive orders targeting law firms over legal work he does not like.\n\nIn August, the Trump administration said it was revoking the security clearances of 37 current and former national security officials. Ordering the revocation of clearances has been a favored retributive tactic that Trump has wielded — or at least tried to — against high-profile political figures, lawyers and intelligence officials in his second term.\n\nZaid said in his lawsuit that he has represented clients across the political spectrum over nearly 35 years, including government officials, law enforcement and military officials and whistleblowers. In 2019, he represented an intelligence community whistleblower whose account of a conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy helped set the stage for the first of two impeachment cases against Trump in his first term.\n\n\"This court joins the several others in this district that have enjoined the government from using the summary revocation of security clearances to penalize lawyers for representing people adverse to it,\" Ali wrote in his order.\n\nAli emphasized that his order does not prevent the government from revoking or suspending Zaid’s clearance for reasons independent of the presidential memorandum and through normal agency processes. The preliminary injunction does not go into effect until January 13.\n\nZaid said in a statement, “This is not just a victory for me, it’s an indictment of the Trump administration’s attempts to intimidate and silence the legal community, especially lawyers who represent people who dare to question or hold this government accountable.\"",

    "description": "The 6th Circuit, relying on the Supreme Court’s Loper Bright decision, ruled that the FCC's 2024 Open Internet Order reclassifying broadband as a tele",
    "fullText": "Update as of January 2, 2025: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit issued a decision on the consolidated petitions for review of the FCC's 2024 Open Internet Order. In its January 2 decision, which relies heavily on principles articulated in Loper Bright, the court held that the FCC's 2024 Open Internet Order reclassifying broadband as a telecommunications service misinterpreted the text of the Communications Act, and therefore the FCC's reclassification exceeded its statutory authority.\n\nInstead, the court held that in offering consumers the capability of retrieving information via telecommunications, ISPs offer an information service and that mobile broadband is not interconnected with the PTSN and is therefore a private mobile service not subject to common carrier regulation. Moreover, given its ruling, the court did not address whether the major questions doctrine also barred the FCC's reclassification. Finally, because the Open Internet Order was already stayed by the 6th Circuit last August, there is no immediate impact and, with the pending change in administration and FCC leadership in less than three weeks, it is unlikely the government will seek any further review through panel or en banc rehearing or certiorari to the Supreme Court, although certain of the intervenors supporting reclassification could.\n\nRead our latest advisory for more about the decision and key takeaways. The original advisory from June 6, 2024, appears below.\n\nOn May 7, 2024, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued its latest network neutrality order, Safeguarding and Securing the Open Internet (the \"Order\"), which was published in the Federal Register on May 22, 2024, making it mostly effective July 22, 2024. This massive document (more than 500 single-spaced pages in all) reinstates, with a few significant modifications, the network neutrality rules that the agency had previously imposed in 2015 (in the Open Internet Order), but which were set aside in 2017 (in the Restoring Internet Freedom, or RIF Order, and the Order on Remand, when the agency shifted from Democratic to Republican control following the 2016 election). Parties have asked the FCC to stay the Order and filed Petitions for Review challenging the Order in court.\n\nThe Order takes the following key steps (discussed in more detail below):\n\nIn broad strokes, the FCC's decisions in the Order – from the legal logic of the classification of BIAS as a telecommunications service, to the content of the new rules, to the exceptions from generally applicable telecommunications regulations – are the same as in the agency's 2015 Open Internet Order. We discuss the most important of those re-created rulings below. In addition, there are some interesting and potentially significant differences between this order and the 2015 Open Internet Order, which we also discuss below.\n\nAs noted above, the Order is extremely lengthy and detailed. We strongly recommend that BIAS providers and other interested parties carefully review the Order and consult with counsel about how the rulings in the Order may affect their decisions and operations going forward. With that caveat, however, set out below is a more in-depth discussion of the Order's key holdings.\n\nThe FCC first adopted a transparency rule in 2010, requiring BIAS providers to disclose accurate information about network management practices, network performance, and commercial terms (pricing, etc.). The FCC reaffirmed that rule in the 2015 Open Internet Order. In the 2017 RIF Order, the FCC modified the rule somewhat. The Order reinstates the 2015 rule.\n\nThe transparency rule requires BIAS providers to disclose information \"sufficient for consumers to make informed choices regarding use of such services.\" The 2017 version, from the RIF Order, states that the information must be sufficient for \"entrepreneurs and other small businesses to develop, market, and maintain internet offerings.\" The rule in the Order specifies that disclosures must be sufficient for \"content, application, service, and device providers to develop, market, and maintain Internet offerings.\"\n\nThe 2017 RIF Order eliminated the requirement that BIAS providers disclose information about packet loss on their networks, but the Order reinstates that obligation.\n\nThe 2017 RIF Order permitted providers to disclose network performance (such as actually achieved data rates) on a reasonably aggregated basis. The Order requires that reported performance must be geographically disaggregated so that a consumer in a given area can learn what to reasonably expect from a BIAS offering. Moreover, the Order requires disclosure of performance over a reasonable period of time and during times of peak usage so that consumers will know how the provider's network performs under conditions of maximum congestion. The Order does not, however, require disclosure of the source, location, timing, or duration of network congestion.\n\nThe obligations to report packet loss and geographically granular performance will not apply to BIAS providers with 100,000 or fewer customers.\n\nThe Order also requires that BIAS providers make their disclosures on the BIAS provider's website and not simply report them to the Commission (which was an option under the 2017 RIF Order). Moreover, the disclosures must be in machine-readable format, such as a .csv file, to facilitate consumers comparing the reported performance of different BIAS providers.\n\nFinally, the Order reinstates the requirement from the 2015 Open Internet Order that BIAS providers give consumers direct notice that their usage is about to trigger a change in performance level (e.g., a rate limitation after the consumer has used up their data allowance). As with packet loss and granular geographic reporting, this requirement does not apply to BIAS providers with 100,000 or fewer customers.\n\nThe 2017 RIF Order did not forbid blocking or throttling and so did not need to impose a carve-out for \"reasonable network management.\" The Order reinstates the no-blocking and no-throttling rules and so also reinstates the carve-out from those rules for \"reasonable network management.\" This exception will only apply to practices that have a \"primarily technical network management justification,\" rather than a justification based on \"other business practices.\" The no-blocking rule also prohibits BIAS providers from charging edge providers a fee to avoid having edge providers' content, services, or applications blocked from reaching BIAS providers' end-user customers.\n\nIf a technical justification exists, the FCC will assess whether a network management practice is reasonable based on the specific technology of a BIAS provider's network. Landline, mobile, and satellite BIAS providers will be able to adopt practices that make sense considering the constraints of their individual network technologies. The FCC specifically states that providers may implement practices needed for network security and that block traffic unwanted by end users (such as spam or malware) and does not prevent or restrict a BIAS provider from refusing to transmit unlawful material, such as child sexual abuse material or copyright-infringing materials. The FCC will consider (that is, view more leniently) practices for managing congestion that only apply during times of actual congestion. Congestion management practices should be \"as application-agnostic as possible.\"\n\nThe 2017 RIF Order purported to broadly preempt state-level regulation of broadband. However, the D.C. Circuit ruled that the FCC could not preempt state regulation when the theory of the RIF Order was that the FCC lacked regulatory authority over broadband in the first place.\n\nThe Order takes a different approach, stating that it will preempt \"any state or local measures that interfere or are incompatible with the federal regulatory framework we establish today.\" However, the FCC will undertake preemption on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, the FCC notes that different states may legitimately impose different requirements regarding (for example) \"customer relationships and billing practices.\" In this regard, the FCC expressly declined to preempt California's \"Internet Consumer Protection and Network Neutrality Act of 2018\" on the ground that the law tracked the rules and requirements of the 2015 Open Internet Order that were set aside by the 2017 RIF Order and thus largely \"mirror or parallel\" the new Order's rules.\n\nThe Order's case-by-case approach to preemption could be problematic in that it may encourage states to impose potentially onerous regulations on BIAS providers under the rubric of consumer protection, in the hope that the regulations will either not be challenged or will survive a preemption attack at the FCC. It remains to be seen how this concern will play out in practice.\n\nEven while imposing net neutrality rules on BIAS providers – which, at a high level, boil down to fulfilling the basic common carrier obligations of nondiscrimination and reasonable conduct – the FCC did not want to impose most of the other, detailed obligations the Communications Act and the agency's own rules impose on telecommunications carriers. So, just as it did in the 2015 Open Internet Order, in the Order the FCC used its authority under Section 10 of the Act to \"forbear\" from applying a wide swath of those obligations.\n\nHere are the key regulatory obligations to which BIAS providers will not be subject under the Order (at least for now):\n\nWhile the FCC exempted BIAS providers from the provisions noted above, it determined that it would not forbear from applying certain other obligations of telecommunications carriers. The key obligations that will apply to BIAS providers are:\n\nIn addition to the specific statutory privacy obligations established by Section 222 of the Act governing the confidentiality of voice service-related \"customer proprietary network information\" (\"CPNI\"), the FCC has interpreted Section 222(a) and the general \"reasonableness\" requirement of Section 201(b) as establishing a general requirement for carriers to protect the confidentiality of customer information that does not fall under the definition of CPNI. Relying on these two statutory provisions, the agency recently promulgated detailed and potentially onerous data security and data breach reporting obligations on all traditional telecommunications carriers. The Order waives those specific rules, at least for now, for BIAS providers. In the meantime, providers have challenged the data security and data breach rules in the Sixth Circuit, arguing that Section 222 does not provide the FCC with authority to regulate customer privacy other than with respect to CPNI.\n\nOne reason for exempting BIAS providers from the new rules is that the agency did not have BIAS providers in mind when it formulated those rules. Beyond that, however, the agency seems to be pursuing some other goals as well.\n\nFirst, as noted above, for some time the agency has contended that Section 222(a) imposes a general obligation to protect customer information, separate and apart from the specific obligation on carriers to protect CPNI. The Order reasserts that view, which many industry participants dispute.\n\nSecond, the agency also contends that it has authority to impose privacy and data security obligations under the general \"just and reasonable\" standard in Section 201, which, again, many industry participants dispute.\n\nThird, in the wake of the 2015 Open Internet Order, in 2016 the agency separately issued an order (the \"2016 Privacy Order\") along with a set of detailed and onerous privacy rules specifically applicable to BIAS providers, relying on Sections 222(a) and 201(b) as authority. This action proved so controversial that Congress invoked the seldom-used Congressional Review Act (CRA) to invalidate those BIAS-specific privacy rules in 2017. Under the CRA, the invalidation of the old rules means that the agency may not adopt new rules that are \"substantially the same\" as the old ones without further authorization from Congress. By exempting BIAS providers from the agency's recently-adopted data security rules and leaving BIAS privacy issues to case-by-case adjudication under Section 201(b) and Section 222(a), and giving BIAS providers \"leeway in the details of how they go about complying with those obligations to a materially greater extent than the much more prescriptive 2016 rules,\" the Order attempts to protect this aspect of its holdings from CRA-based attacks. It remains to be seen whether this protection will prove sufficient on appeal.\n\nThe Order restores Section 224 pole attachment protections to BIAS-only providers, including both wireline and wireless providers, giving them the same rights as cable system operators and telecommunications service providers to non-discriminatory access to investor owned utility poles guaranteed by Section 224(f). In addition, ISPs attaching to such poles in 26 states where pole attachment rates, terms and conditions are regulated by the FCC may now avail themselves of FCC rules which, among other things, establish pole access timelines, limit pole attachment rates and allocation of pole-related costs, and establish procedures for resolving pole attachment disputes.\n\nMoreover, the classification will automatically apply in two \"reverse preemption\" states that have adopted FCC pole attachment rules outright (Pennsylvania and West Virginia) and in states that have limited preemption of the FCC's regulation to cable television system access. Notably, some of the remaining states that have reverse preempted the FCC already have extended their rules to cover broadband service providers. Other reverse preemption states may choose to amend their laws to ensure that their pole attachment rules cover BIAS providers.\n\nIn response to comments filed by the California Public Utility Commission, the FCC also declared that reclassification provides states with the requisite legal authority to protect public safety concerns associated with broadband-only infrastructure. While this may bolster a state's ability to extend existing regulations to broadband, a state's ability to do so will also depend on the specific state laws governing this area.\n\nSection 253 of the Act (for any telecommunications carrier) and Section 332 of the Act (for wireless carriers) protect against state or local governments taking actions that unduly interfere with the ability of a carrier to enter a market and offer its services, including, specifically, unreasonable or discriminatory restrictions on access to public rights-of-way for placing communications facilities. With reclassification, BIAS providers may now seek FCC or court intervention under those provisions when state or local regulations effectively prohibit the provision of BIAS services including by restricting competitive deployment.\n\nThe FCC concluded that reclassification of BIAS means that the agency's rules regarding the provision of telecommunications or cable services in MTEs (such as apartment and office buildings) now apply to BIAS-only providers. According to the FCC, it may now require BIAS-only providers to comply with the same requirements that apply to telecommunications and cable providers in MTEs, including rules that prohibit exclusive access and service contracts, as well as \"graduated revenue sharing\" where the landlord/owner receives greater compensation as the percentage of residents taking the service rises.\n\nBecause BIAS is now classified as a telecommunications service, BIAS services and equipment must be made accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities in accordance with Part 6 of the FCC rules. As noted by the FCC, people who are deaf, hard of hearing, deafblind, or have speech disabilities increasingly rely on IP-based video conferencing services to communicate. These services, like IP-based video relay service, require multiparty synchronous high definition video to accommodate sign language communication. Practically speaking, this means that BIAS providers may not adopt network management practices that have the effect of degrading the connections carrying video communications of persons with hearing and disabilities, such as blocking or throttling, bandwidth limits, data caps, or requirements to pay additional fees to obtain sufficient capacity. It also means that the means for accessing BIAS and any customer support for BIAS, including bills and technical support, must also be accessible to persons with disabilities.\n\nIn the 2015 Open Internet Order, the FCC described the extension of its accessibility rules to BIAS as essentially already covered by its accessibility rules governing Advanced Communications Services (\"ACS\"). The current Order, however, acknowledges a distinction, stating clearly for first time that BIAS is not ACS. Notably, BIAS, like traditional telecom and interconnected VoIP services, is subject to a lower standard of achievement (\"readily achievable,\" i.e., accomplishable without much difficulty or expense) than applies to ACS (\"achievable,\" i.e., with reasonable effort or expense). However, video conferencing services that rely upon BIAS are a form of ACS, so this may be a distinction without a purpose.\n\nThe main policy justification for reclassifying broadband as a telecommunications service in the 2015 Open Internet Order was that broadband providers had the incentive and ability to interfere with people's ability to access the online content they wanted. Expressly barring BIAS providers from such interference would protect the \"virtuous cycle\" of innovation by edge providers driving demand for broadband, leading to increased investment in broadband infrastructure.\n\nThe Order certainly mentions the importance of the \"virtuous cycle\" but does not emphasize it. Instead, the policy focus of the Order is that treating BIAS as a telecommunications service will allow the FCC to protect national security, promote cybersecurity, enhance public safety, monitor and enhance network resiliency and reliability, and protect consumer privacy and data security.\n\nThis shift in policy emphasis does not directly affect the agency's legal analysis underlying the Order's reclassification of broadband. At the same time, this shift is not merely cosmetic. Whatever may have been true a decade ago, today the Internet is so deeply embedded in the country's cultural, political, and economic life – and the international environment is so much more tense – that the risks of leaving this critical infrastructure unmonitored and unregulated are, from the agency's perspective, too great. The time since the Open Internet Order has seen a vast increase in remote work, remote learning, and remote healthcare – driven by the COVID-19 pandemic – all of which depend on a robust, resilient, reliable Internet. During that same time, the FCC has banned the use of certain Chinese equipment in United States telecommunications networks and barred certain Chinese entities from owning those networks. Classifying broadband as a telecommunications service is the most straightforward and direct way under existing law to bring broadband networks under federal supervision.\n\nThis shift in policy emphasis also constitutes a form of \"political insurance\" for reclassification if Republicans retake control of the agency following the 2024 election. The 2015 Open Internet Order was framed as an exercise of economic and consumer protection regulation, which made it an easy target for a deregulation-minded Republican-controlled FCC. But even if a new Republican majority in 2025 is skeptical of the need to regulate BIAS to protect consumers and encourage investment, promoting national security and protecting critical infrastructure against foreign adversaries – the focus of the Order – are likely to retain bipartisan appeal. The shift in policy emphasis in the Order may make it less likely that a future Commission would reverse the reclassification of broadband as a telecommunications service.\n\nEvery major court decision addressing an FCC ruling classifying broadband either as a telecommunications service or as an information service has expressly and heavily relied on the Chevron doctrine, under which courts defer to an agency's interpretation of its own statute if that interpretation is, broadly speaking, reasonable. The Supreme Court in Brand X relied on Chevron to uphold the FCC's then-current classification of cable broadband as an information service. The D.C. Circuit in USTA relied on Chevron to uphold the FCC's 2015 reclassification of broadband, in the Open Internet Order, as a telecommunications service. And the D.C. Circuit in Mozilla relied on Chevron to uphold (for the most part) the FCC's 2017 second reclassification of broadband, in the RIF Order, as (again) an information service.\n\nIf Chevron remains good law, courts may view the Order as reflecting a reasonable reading of the definitions in the Communications Act as applied to broadband – just as occurred with the 2015 Open Internet Order – and defer to the Commission's reclassification. But it is widely anticipated that the current Supreme Court, perhaps even this term, will cut back on the scope of Chevron. If that happens, reviewing courts may be less likely to defer and instead would have more leeway to determine not just whether the FCC's current interpretation of the Act is broadly reasonable, but also whether that interpretation represents the \"best\" or \"correct\" reading of the law. Anticipating this possibility, the Order takes great pains to explain why, in the agency's view, its reading of the law is not only reasonable but is, in fact, correct – an apparent effort to protect its reclassification decision against the possible demise of Chevron.\n\nIn this regard, while opponents of excessive regulation generally favor cutting back on Chevron, here a victory on that issue could be a double-edged sword. If Chevron is no longer good law, and if it turns out that the courts agree with the FCC that the Communications Act requires treating broadband as a telecommunications service, this would limit the ability of even a future conservative, deregulation-minded FCC to reclassify and deregulate broadband service.\n\nSince the time of the FCC's 2015 Open Internet Order, the Supreme Court has, on several occasions, clarified and expanded the major question doctrine, which says that agencies are not permitted to interpret a broad, general grant of authority as including the power to decide \"major questions\" – that is, questions with \"vast economic and political significance.\" Under this doctrine, for an agency to address such questions requires express authorization from Congress. Some opponents of classifying broadband as a telecommunications service argued before the FCC that this would constitute action on a \"major question,\" which, they argue, is a step the agency may not take because Congress has not expressly authorized it.\n\nThe Order rejects that claim, for several reasons. It argues that the major question doctrine does not apply to this decision at all, since regulating communications networks is the agency's core function. It notes that Congress has not provided any guidance on the question of classification of Internet access (both broadband and dial-up) even though the agency has addressed the issue in a range of contexts since at least 1998; according to the Order, this indicates that Congress is content to leave the issue to the agency's discretion. And the agency argues that treating broadband as a telecommunications service simply does not have the \"vast economic and political significance\" required to bring the major question doctrine into play.\n\nGiven the Supreme Court's expansion of the major question doctrine in recent years, it is highly likely that parties opposing the Order will raise this issue as part of their challenges in court.\n\nDWT's communications and privacy and security groups are familiar with all aspects of the new net neutrality regime. Readers should feel free to reach out to us with any questions about how the new rules will apply to or affect BIAS provider operations going forward.",

    "description": "A veteran civil rights attorney won a landmark redistricting case. He fears such wins could soon vanish.",
    "fullText": "The beleaguered Voting Rights Act is on the ropes again — and it may soon suffer a crippling strike.\n\nThe Supreme Court seems on the verge of making it much harder to use the landmark civil rights measure to force states to draw districts where minority candidates stand a strong chance of winning. And a key provision that lets private groups sue under the 60-year-old law could be the next to fall.\n\nThat would be a huge blow to civil rights lawyers like Mississippi’s Carroll Rhodes, who’s spent his career leveraging the Voting Rights Act to increase the political power of Black people and other minorities.\n\n“It becomes almost an impossible hill to climb,” Rhodes told POLITICO Magazine.\n\nOver the past decade or so, the VRA has been battered by a series of hits from the increasingly conservative high court. In 2013, the justices knocked out a key pillar of the law by eliminating “pre-clearance” requirements for advance approval of voting changes, including redistricting, in most or all of nine states and a smattering of localities.\n\nIn recent months, petitions have stacked up at the Supreme Court that could lead to the justices wiping out the long-assumed right of private groups and individuals to bring lawsuits under the law. And, earlier this month, the high court blocked a lower court’s Voting Rights Act ruling and gave Texas a green light to redraw its congressional map at President Donald Trump’s request in order to give Republicans up to five additional House seats.\n\nDespite those challenges, litigators like Rhodes have had significant success harnessing the VRA. A lawsuit he pressed forced redistricting and a special election in Mississippi last month led to Black Democrats picking up two additional seats in the state’s House. The incremental gain broke a longstanding GOP supermajority in a state that is nearly 40 percent Black — the highest percentage in the nation. Those sorts of advances for minority representation could come to a halt if the Supreme Court rules against the law.\n\nI reached Rhodes at his law office in the small town of Hazelhurst, Miss. and asked him to take stock of the bruises the VRA has sustained, the threats it faces at the moment and how he’s managed to use the law to advance minority power in his home state.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThe Voting Rights Act has taken a lot of major hits from the Supreme Court in the past couple decades. Many lawyers now see it as teetering on the brink of irrelevance or impotence. What are the stakes in the pending case, Louisiana v. Callais, and whether states doing redistricting can sometimes make use of race to comply with the VRA?\n\nSome people are concerned that the Voting Rights Act might be on its way out, but I'm an eternal optimist. Given that the Voting Rights Act was passed by Congress pursuant to the 15th Amendment, and the 15th Amendment guarantees the right to vote on an equal basis, not on account of race, to everyone — I think in the Callais case that they're going to resolve that issue in favor of [the law] being upheld.\n\nYou’ve had considerable success in Mississippi with the Voting Rights Act and the state legislature there. Does that confound perceptions that the VRA is at death’s door?\n\nWe have been successful. A lot of civil rights organizations and civil rights opponents have been successful in using the Voting Rights Act to increase the number of Black elected officials.\n\nIn Mississippi, for the most part, whites do not vote for Black candidates in contested elections, and that's why the Voting Rights Act has been so successful in creating Black majority districts.\n\nWhen you have a minority population that's large enough, concentrated enough, and they're in these election districts where they cannot elect candidates of their choice — because the majority population always votes against their candidates of choice — you have to redraw the districts in such a way so you give this large, geographically insular minority group the ability to elect the representative of their choice. And Mississippi's demographics have made it easier for us to be successful here.\n\nHas there been a concrete impact to this?\n\nThere was a time where we had 45 or 50 Black people elected from Black majority districts in the Mississippi Legislature. And there were Black chairmen of different committees, even the powerful committees. But what has happened over the years, more and more white Democrats have left the Democratic Party and gone toward the Republican Party, so now you have a [GOP] supermajority in the Senate. We broke that in this last election.\n\nWhen you break the supermajority in the Senate, money bills, especially taxing and spending, budget, a lot of times it takes a supermajority to get those bills passed. If there is no supermajority, then that means that the Republican leadership within the Senate will have to negotiate with most of the Black people elected as Democrats.\n\nHave those legislators been able to use this effective veto to actually get some spending concessions in terms of, “You're going to spend in this part of the state or on these types of programs?”\n\nWe won't know yet because the special election just took place, and the legislature comes back in January. So, we will see if this cohesive group of Black Democrats can get some concessions.\n\nIn 2013, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the Shelby County decision, which ended the requirement that many states, including Mississippi, most places across the South and a few in the North, had to submit any voting changes — including redistricting — to the Justice Department to get approved. The maps that Mississippi adopted in 2022, which you successfully challenged in court, were they put in place initially because of the Shelby County decision?\n\nThey were able to do it directly because of Shelby County, yes. And John Roberts got it wrong. I agree with Justice Ginsburg who said at the time, it’s like standing up under the umbrella and it's not raining and saying, “Oh, it's not raining, so you can let the umbrella down.” That's what that Roberts decision did: took the umbrella down. And rain is falling everywhere.\n\nUnder the process essentially abandoned after Shelby County, the maps had to be submitted to Washington, and that took place under presidents both Republican and Democrat. The maps that you challenged, do you think President Obama's Justice Department would have approved them? What about President George W. Bush’s Justice Department or President Donald Trump’s Justice Department?\n\nThe Trump Justice Department would have approved them, but no other president. And I'm going to go back to Obama, Biden, Clinton, I'd even go back to Ronald Reagan. The strange thing is that Ronald Reagan initially was opposed to the Voting Rights Act extension in 1982 but wound up signing it and cited it as the crown jewel of American democracy. And so the Trump Justice Department probably is the only one, because the Trump Justice Department had flipped what the purpose of the Voting Rights Act was — to protect minority voters — to say it's to protect white voters.\n\nRoberts has been on the court now for 22 years. The first decade and a half or so, he was viewed uniformly as hostile to voting rights enforcement. That was seen as one of his animating issues. But there have been a few decisions in recent years where the court has not been as aggressive toward the Voting Rights Act as some expected. It seems like Roberts went along with this current Callais case being punted for a year, which basically left those districts in place through the current election cycle. Is there something going on with Roberts? Do you think he has shifted or moderated at all?\n\nMy personal take is that he really is really an incrementalist. He's not for upending longstanding precedent and what the country has become accustomed to. He believes in incremental changes and I think the Shelby County decision came about because he genuinely thought that so much advancement had been made in this area that it was no longer necessary for those protections. And I think after Shelby County, he's seen that those protections are still needed. His views might be moderating somewhat. He might see the damage that Shelby County decision has caused.\n\nYou've had this span of four or five decades to look at how these things have developed. How has technology changed this process of redistricting? Has it made it easier for those trying to dilute the power of minority voters to do that, and have people on your side of the fight been able to harness that technology in any similar fashion to fight back against those efforts?\n\nWhen I first started out in this area, the map drawers used maps and pencils and even had notepads to add before the calculators came. Then calculators and then the programs and social science has developed over the years, too. Statistical analysis has become more and more sophisticated, and the technology has become more and more sophisticated.\n\nMy take is that whoever writes the algorithm, whoever writes the code, the code can be written in such a way that it could lead to more discrimination and make it harder to undo.\n\nWe do have folks on our side who are using technology, but technology was used in the Texas case to draw districts in such a way that discriminated against Black and Latino voters in Texas.\n\nYou were a teenager when a lot of these landmark civil rights laws were passed in the ‘60s. Do you personally have memories of what the Jim Crow South was like? Did any of your relatives experience some of these more bizarre tests that were used for decades before that to exclude Black people from voting, like, ‘How many bubbles are in a bar of soap?’ or ‘How many jelly beans are in the jar?’\n\nOh, yes. I was born in ‘51. I grew up in a segregated neighborhood, went to an all-Black high school, segregated high school, segregated elementary school. I remember going to the dentist. And the dentist office had two entrances, one for white, one for “colored,” and going through the white side, they had air conditioning. They had magazines. The “colored” side did not.\n\nWe had field trips to the courthouse, where the courthouse had white and “colored” water fountains. And we had to sit in the balcony. I remember a third grade field trip to the courthouse and we watched a trial where a white lawyer was defending a Black man accused of some crime. And he was saying, “This was a good Nigra” — N-I-G-R-A.\n\nAnd so I grew up through it and I also remember my parents when the Voting Rights Act was first passed, and they did have federal registrars around, but all of the neighbors, my parents and everybody not only did they go and register to vote, they voted in every election, no matter what.\n\nThere were people telling us stories. Tim Winston owned a funeral home here and he was one of the few Black people who was able to register prior to the Voting Rights Act being passed, and he told stories of how they were turning away Black folks by asking them ridiculous questions. So, yeah, I remember, personally, stories of how hard it was before the Voting Rights Act was passed and after it was passed.\n\nIf the Voting Rights Act Section Two were to be knocked out and it wasn't a tool you could use anymore, what would be the strategy after that? Would that mean there's no option for civil rights groups? What is the world going to look like if the VRA is not available for private groups to litigate?\n\nIt almost becomes an impossible hill to climb. You have to go back to the 15th Amendment and prove intentional discrimination, which is difficult, or the 14th Amendment and prove intentional discrimination, which is difficult. All a legislative body has to do is say, “We didn't draw the district based on race. We drew them based on partisanship, and they're entitled to the presumption that there was a good faith effort to do that, and it's hard.” We had overwhelming evidence in Texas that partisanship was not the real reason. If that cannot overcome a presumption that the legislator was acting in good faith, going forward, it's going to be impossible to prove a racial gerrymandering claim.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the federal Constitution puts no limits on partisan gerrymandering, even as the justices continue to aggressively police use of race in redistricting. Is that line meaningful?\n\nRace and party, in Mississippi, there’s no distinction. It’s a fiction.",

    "fullText": "Decision from state supreme court on deal once worth $56bn and now worth some $139bn overturns ruling that prompted angry Musk backlash\n\nElon Musk’s controversial $56bn pay package from Tesla was reinstated by the Delaware supreme court on Friday, two years after a lower court struck down the vast compensation deal as “unfathomable”.\n\nThe reinstated pay package could be worth as much as $139bn today, according to the New York Times. The decision comes less than two months after Tesla shareholders approved a new plan that could be worth $1tn to Musk, already the world’s richest person, in a decade’s time. Musk’s fortune currently stands at an estimated $600bn.\n\nRescinding the pay deal would be “inequitable”, and would leave Musk “uncompensated for his time and efforts over a period of six years”, the Delaware supreme court justices wrote, echoing arguments from Tesla board members earlier this year.\n\nAt the company’s annual meeting in Austin, Texas, this November, shareholders had approved a stopgap measure for Musk, ensuring – regardless of how the Delaware supreme court ruled on this appeal – that he would get the $56bn his supporters say he is owed.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment or \n\nBoth of the compensation packages, as well as other pay plans approved by Tesla shareholders, require Musk to meet a number of lofty goals related to product development and increasing the company’s value to $8.5tn in order to cash out on those awards.\n\nThe case that first invalidated the original pay package was launched seven years ago when a Tesla stockholder, who held just nine shares at the time, filed a suit arguing that the plan was set up to overpay the world’s richest person. That first ruling voided the billions Musk was to receive, which left the Tesla co-founder less than pleased.\n\nNot only did Musk relocate Tesla to Texas from Delaware, where it was incorporated at the time the suit began, he also publicly lashed out against the state and specifically its court of chancery and chief judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick.\n\n“She has done more to damage Delaware than any judge in modern history,” he wrote on X, his social media platform, in February 2024.\n\nTesla stockholders in 2024 were again asked to vote on the 2018 pay package. They approved it, and once again, McCormick struck it down, ruling that the “Superstar CEO”, as she called him, had undue influence in developing his own pay package and that stockholders weren’t fully informed ahead of the vote.\n\nMusk has voiced his displeasure ever since.\n\n“Any lawyer still recommending incorporation in Delaware at this point should be sued for malpractice,” he posted online earlier this year.\n\nIn Friday’s opinion, the justices agreed with McCormick’s earlier findings that there was a breach of fiduciary duty in developing the original package and presenting it to shareholders. They ordered $1 be paid to the plaintiff in nominal damages.\n\nHowever, the five judges agreed that rescinding Musk’s full pay package wasn’t appropriate.\n\nWhile Musk has publicly called for other companies to follow his lead and leave Delaware – which has historically been home to more than 60% of Fortune 500 companies – experts have tracked only a few dozen companies that have actually done so. That includes big companies including Dropbox and Coinbase, while other tech companies like Meta have only threatened to leave.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk is entitled to his $55.8 billion Tesla pay package from 2018, Delaware's Supreme Court ruled.\n\nA Delaware Chancery Court judge struck down the compensation package last year after a Tesla shareholder sued over the massive payday, which was tied to a series of growth goalposts for the EV company.\n\nThe Delaware Supreme Court's ruling overturns that decision, saying it was too extreme a remedy.\n\nTesla shareholders recently approved an even bigger pay package of up to $1 trillion for Musk if Tesla achieves further sales and growth goals.\n\nThe decision to withhold his 2018 pay package prompted Musk to criticize Delaware on several occasions. Delaware's long-standing reputation for being business-friendly is rooted in the Delaware General Corporation Law, which serves as the foundation of its corporate law.\n\n\"Companies should get the hell out of Delaware,\" Musk wrote on X in August 2024.\n\nAt the time, two of Musk's companies — Tesla and SpaceX — were incorporated in Delaware. He moved those companies to Texas in 2024.\n\nDespite Delaware's position as a central incorporation hub, a series of court rulings left some prominent companies wondering if they could find stronger legal protections somewhere else, including VC firm Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nThe firm announced in July that its primary business, AH Capital Management, would no longer be incorporated in Delaware because \"legal uncertainty\" had worried investors and entrepreneurs on its board.\n\n\"As a result, many of the companies we fund and the entrepreneurs that we talk to are taking a second look at whether they should incorporate in other jurisdictions, prompted by the departure from Delaware of significant technology companies like Dropbox, Tripadvisor, and Tesla,\" the firm said in a blog post.\n\nThe firm said it's reincorporating in Nevada, an increasingly popular alternative.\n\nBusinesses incorporated in Delaware account for a large chunk of the state's revenue. As of 2024, more than 2.1 million businesses were incorporated in Delaware, meaning a widespread exodus could do serious damage to its economy.\n\nEven so, Delaware Secretary of State Charuni Patibanda-Sanchez told Business Insider that officials aren't spooked by the \"political rhetoric.\"\n\n\"What our data is showing is that Delaware is still the preeminent place to incorporate your business,\" she said.\n\nPatibanda-Sanchez added: \"We don't believe that Delaware's position as the corporate leader and corporate capital of the world is being threatened in any significant way. We always come under threat, though, because states are always trying to get a piece of the action.\"",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court sided with immigration judges on Friday, rebuffing the Trump administration for now in a case with possible implications for federal workers as the justices weigh expanding presidential firing power.\n\nThe decision is a technical step in a long-running case, but it touches on the effects of a series of high-profile firings under President Donald Trump. The justices let stand a ruling that raised questions about the Trump administration's handling of the federal workforce, though they also signaled that lower courts should move cautiously.\n\nImmigration judges are federal employees, and the question at the center of the appeal is about whether they can sue to challenge a policy restricting their public speeches or if they are required to use a separate complaint system for the federal workforce.\n\nTrump's Republican administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene after an appeals court found that Trump’s firings of top complaint system officials had raised questions about whether it's still working as intended.\n\nThe Justice Department said the firings are within the president’s power and the lower court had no grounds to raise questions. The solicitor general asked the Supreme Court to quickly freeze the ruling as he pushes to have the immigration judges’ case removed from federal court.\n\nThe justices declined, though they also said the Trump administration could return if the lower courts moved too fast. There were no noted dissents. The court has allowed most of Trump’s firings for now and is weighing whether to formally expand his legal power to fire independent agency officials by overturning job protections enshrined in a 90-year-old decision.\n\nA union formerly representing immigration judges, who work for the Justice Department, first sued in 2020 to challenge a policy restricting what the judges can speak about in public. They say the case is a free-speech issue that belongs in federal court.\n\nRamya Krishnan, an attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute who argued the case on the union's behalf, applauded the high court's Friday decision. “The restrictions on immigration judges’ free speech rights are unconstitutional, and it’s intolerable that this prior restraint is still in place,” Krishnan said.\n\nIn recent months, the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has included firing dozens of immigration judges who are seen by his allies as too lenient.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to an email message seeking comment Friday.\n\nWhile the order is not a final decision, the case could eventually have implications for other federal workers who want to challenge firings in court rather than the employee complaint system now largely overseen by Trump appointees.\n\nThe decision comes after a series of wins for the Justice Department on the high court’s emergency docket. The court has sided with the Trump administration about two dozen times on issues ranging from immigration to federal funding.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court.",

    "fullText": "JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A judge on Friday ordered special elections for the Mississippi Supreme Court after earlier finding that the electoral map used to select justices violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nU.S. District Judge Sharion Aycock in August ordered Mississippi to redraw the map, which was enacted in 1987, concluding the current configuration dilutes the power of Black voters. The Friday ruling gives the Mississippi Legislature until the end of its 2026 regular session to redraw the map.\n\nSection 2, which is the primary way plaintiffs can push back against racially discriminatory election practices, is currently being challenged at the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nOnce the legislature approves a new map, Aycock wrote that she will move quickly to meet any deadlines necessary to hold the special elections in November 2026.\n\nAycock also wrote that she will defer deciding which seats will be subject to a special election until after the new map has been adopted.\n\nThe order follows a 2022 lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union, which argued the current map cuts Mississippi’s Delta region — a historically Black area — in half, diminishing the Black vote in the Central District.\n\n“Mississippi is nearly 40% Black, but has never had more than one Black Justice on the nine-member Court,\" Ari Savitzky, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project, wrote in a statement. \"We couldn’t be happier to see justice on the horizon.”\n\nIn her August ruling, Aycock noted only four Black people have served on Mississippi’s Supreme Court. All of them held the same seat in the Central District and were first appointed to the position by a sitting governor.\n\nThe Mississippi Secretary of State’s Office is appealing Aycock’s August ruling. The Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has stayed its proceedings pending the outcomes of the SCOTUS case and other related cases.\n\nThe Mississippi Secretary of State and Attorney General’s offices did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn December, two Mississippi Supreme Court justices were appointed to federal judgeships. Gov. Tate Reeves will appoint replacements to serve until new justices can be elected.\n\nIn Mississippi, Supreme Court elections are nonpartisan.",
