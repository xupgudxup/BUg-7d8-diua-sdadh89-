    "title": "Trump, 79, Rants About ‘OBLITERATION’ of SCOTUS in Morning Meltdown",
    "description": "President Donald Trump unleashed an early Friday rant where he claimed Democrats were looking to obliterate the Supreme Court in a bizarre social media post. It’s the latest unsubstantiated ramble by the president, 79, as he faces growing disapproval from voters and the looming threat of a blue wave in next year’s midterms. “The Democrats number one policy push is the complete and total OBLITERATION of our great United States Supreme Court,” Trump wrote. “They will do this on their very first day in office, through the simple Termination of the Filibuster, SHOULD THEY WIN THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS.”",

    "description": "Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities carried out a public execution at a stadium in the eastern city of Khost on Tuesday, putting to death a man who the country’s Supreme Court said had killed 13 members of a family, including several children, earlier this year.  Tens of thousands of people, including relatives of the victims, attended the execution in the sports stadium, which the Supreme Court said was the 11th carried out since the Taliban seized power in 2021 in the wake of the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. and NATO forces.  United Nations’ Special Rapporteur for Afghanistan Richard Bennet posted on X earlier Tuesday that reports had suggested the public execution was imminent and called for it to be halted.",

    "description": "The Wisconsin Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered a pair of three-judge panels to hear two lawsuits that argue the battleground state’s congressional maps must be redrawn because they unconstitutionally favor Republicans.  The court's minority conservative justices blasted the creation of the three-judge panels as unimaginable political maneuvering designed to benefit Democrats.  The court battle in Wisconsin is playing out amid a national redistricting battle as President Donald Trump is trying to preserve a slim Republican majority in the House in next year’s elections.",
