    "fullText": "The parents of a college football cheerleader found dead have filed a $1 million lawsuit.\n\nBrianna Aguilera, a 19-year-old college football cheerleader, was found dead in Austin, Texas during rivalry weekend. The college student was found dead at the bottom of an apartment complex. The Austin Police Department suggested that Aguilera took her own life, though the cheerleader's mother strongly disagreed.\n\nStephanie Rodriguez, the mother of the deceased cheerleader, ripped Austin Police for their investigation.\n\n“Please don’t believe this lazy investigator and Investigation!” Stephanie Rodriguezwrote on Facebook.\n\nNow, the parents of the cheerleader have filed a $1 million lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed against Austin Blacks Rugby Club and the University of Texas’ Latin Economics and Business Association. The seven-figure lawsuit accuses the two school organizations of allegedly serving their daughter alcohol before her death.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Aguilera was served her first drink around 6 p.m. She was allegedly continued to be served drinks for several hours, before stumbling away. Aguilera ended up at an apartment where she was supposed to spend the night. Ultimately, she fell to her death around midnight.\n\n“We believe even more today this was not a suicide as has been suggested by police. This was either an accident or something much more sinister,” Tony Buzbee, lead attorney with the Buzbee Law Firm, who is representing Aguilera’s parents, said at a press conference.\n\nHe added: “If the police department will not do its job, then we will do it for them.\"\n\nThe police said that they found a deleted suicide note on Aguilera's phone. However, attorneys representing Aguilera's family say that it was just a drafted essay.\n\nAn official cause of death has yet to be released. An investigation into the death remains to be underway.",

    "description": "Nearly four years after the lawsuit was first filed, a key threshold question is moving toward a final answer.",
    "fullText": "Nearly four years after the lawsuit was first filed, a key threshold question is moving toward a final answer.\n\nThe NFL has filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court as to the question of whether the civil action filed in February 2022 by former Dolphins coach (and current Vikings defensive coordinator) Brian Flores against the NFL, the Dolphins, the Giants, the Broncos, and the Texans will be resolved in court, or in arbitration.\n\nThe specific legal question presented to the Supreme Court is this: \"Whether an arbitration agreement governing disputes in a professional sports league is categorically unenforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act because it designates the league commissioner as the default arbitrator and permits the commissioner to develop arbitral procedures.\"\n\nThe NFL has wisely narrowed the question, given that the reasoning (if applied throughout corporate America) would empower other companies to attempt to rig the in-house arbitration process by putting employment disputes in the hands of the CEO. Still, the league's position is clear — it wants the Commissioner to retain power over disputes involving the NFL and the various teams that have hired and that handsomely compensate the Commissioner.\n\nThe 25-page document is the first step in an effort to persuade the Supreme Court to take up the case. Of the many petitions it receives each year, few are accepted.\n\nMore time will pass as the Supreme Court considers whether to take the case. Even more time will pass if the Supreme Court grants the petition.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit invalidated the NFL's arbitration provision, concluding that the procedure lacks independence. (And it does.) The Supreme Court, if it takes the case, will decide once and for all whether it's legitimate for the NFL (and any sports league) to put its Commissioner in charge of claims made against the NFL.\n\nIt's fundamentally unfair to delegate those powers to someone whose connection to one side of a legal fight is so obvious. Frankly, no Commissioner should want to be expected to set aside their clear self-interests in an effort to dispense justice in an objective way.\n\nBut this has been the league's practice, for years. It desperately wants to run its own business. It desperately hopes to hold the gavel when it comes to deciding whether the legal claims against it are valid.\n\nIt's a bad way to do business. It's now for the Supreme Court to decide whether it's a good way, or a bad way, to apply the laws of the United States.",

    "fullText": "Judge says there is plenty of evidence to suggest OpenAI’s leaders made assurances nonprofit structure would be kept\n\nElon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI is to go to trial after a US judge said there is plenty of evidence to support the billionaire’s case.\n\nThe world’s richest man, who co-founded OpenAI, is suing the ChatGPT developer and its chief executive, Sam Altman, over claims its leaders violated the organisation’s founding mission by shifting to a for-profit model.\n\nThe US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, told a hearing there was plenty of evidence that suggested OpenAI’s leaders made assurances that its original nonprofit structure was going to be maintained.\n\nShe said there were enough disputed facts to let a jury consider the claims at a trial scheduled for March, rather than decide the issues herself. Rogers said she would issue a written order after the hearing that addresses OpenAI’s attempt to throw out the case.\n\nThe court dispute comes amid a broader showdown over dominance in the market for generative artificial intelligence. Musk’s xAI and its chatbot Grok are competing with OpenAI and other technology developers.\n\nMusk is seeking unspecified monetary damages from what he calls “ill-gotten gains” by OpenAI.\n\nIn a statement after the hearing, OpenAI said: “Mr Musk’s lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial.”\n\nMusk’s startup xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSteven Molo, a lead trial attorney for the billionaire and xAI, said after the hearing: “We look forward to presenting all the evidence of the defendants’ wrongdoing to the jury.”\n\nMusk contends he contributed about $38m (£28m), roughly 60% of OpenAI’s early funding, along with strategic guidance and credibility, based on assurances that the organisation would remain a nonprofit dedicated to the public benefit.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses OpenAI co-founders Altman and Greg Brockman of plotting a for-profit switch to enrich themselves, culminating in multibillion-dollar deals with Microsoft and a recent restructuring.\n\nOpenAI, Altman and Brockman have denied the claims, and have described Musk as “a frustrated commercial competitor seeking to slow down a mission-driven market leader”.\n\nMicrosoft, which is also a defendant, urged Rogers to throw out Musk’s claims against it. A lawyer for Microsoft said there was no evidence that the company “aided and abetted” OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft has been approached for comment.\n\nLawyers for OpenAI at the hearing asked Rogers to enter judgment against Musk, contending that he had not shown enough of a factual basis to sustain his allegations including fraud and breach of contract.\n\nOpenAI also contends that Musk failed to bring his allegations in a timely manner. The judge said the jury would be asked to weigh whether the lawsuit was filed outside the statute of limitations.",

    "description": "Warner Bros. Discovery rejects Paramount Skydance's leveraged buyout bid again, citing financial and litigation risk",
    "fullText": "Warner Bros. Discovery's board raised its hackles on Wednesday while rejecting Paramount Skydance's bid for the eighth time in favor of Netflix's offer.\n\nWBD used pointed language, calling Paramount's bid the \"largest leveraged buyout in history by a wide margin\" and tying its potential failure to previous big LBOs that didn't close on the initially agreed-upon terms.\n\nIn its new filing, WBD also described Paramount's financial condition as \"not strong,\" noting that its credit was already rated \"junk\" by S&P before the \"extraordinary amount of debt financing\" required by the deal. Paramount, for its part, has emphasized that $40.4 billion in equity of its new bid is fully backstopped by Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison.\n\nWBD's strong language suggests that the board and leadership \"just want to move on,\" and the \"largest LBO\" angle is a new and compelling one, Wharton M&A professor Paul Nary said on X.\n\nDavid Zaslav-led WBD also ramped up its accusations that Paramount has acted litigiously and leaked to the press.\n\nIn the filing, WBD cited new press reports in the New York Post indicating Paramount was considering abandoning its offer and might pursue \"DefCon 1\" litigation against WBD's board. WBD said that Paramount didn't deny the reports, suggesting that the company was leaking to the press. WBD had previously complained that there had been \"extensive media leaks and rumors\" about Paramount's proposals.\n\nM&A experts said the stepped-up language was likely drafted in anticipation of a lawsuit against WBD, either by Paramount or WBD shareholders.\n\nNow that Paramount has lost to Netflix, \"it is likely to attempt to seek legal remedy such as a shareholder derivative suit or potentially a direct lawsuit,\" said Raul Gastesi, a partner at Gastesi Lopez Mestre & Cobiella.\n\nCorey Martin, managing partner of Granderson Des Rochers, a law firm focused on entertainment and media, said the new filing felt calibrated to deter WBD shareholders from backing Paramount's hostile bid.\n\n\"The audience is really the shareholders, because there's always the risk of shareholder lawsuits,\" Martin said. \"It is colorful stuff, but Paramount's is a hostile bid.\"\n\nMartin also saw the emphasis on legal and press tactics as part of a PR strategy to portray Paramount as a bad actor, as well as a pre-litigation tactic.\n\nLightShed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield wrote in a note on Wednesday that Paramount could still outbid Netflix, but it would \"require an overhaul of their current bid, and a dramatic increase in the cash invested from the Ellison family and/or their friends and financing partners.\"",

    "fullText": "It looks like Sam Altman and Elon Musk are headed for a courtroom showdown.\n\nDuring a hearing on Wednesday, a California judge said she plans to reject Altman's lawyers' last-ditch efforts to end Musk's case against OpenAI and its CEO.\n\n\"This case is going to trial,\" US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said at a hearing to consider whether the evidence was sufficient to warrant a jury trial.\n\n\"I think there's plenty of evidence,\" she said, referring to Musk's case. \"It's circumstantial, but that's how these things work.\"\n\nIn his lawsuit filed in 2024, Musk accused OpenAI of misleading him in its decision to abandon its original nonprofit mission and structure in favor of a profit-oriented model, including through its partnership with Microsoft.\n\nMusk says he donated $38 million to the maker of ChatGPT over the years to support its mission to develop AI for the benefit of humankind. The Tesla CEO is seeking monetary damages, as well as a judgment to void Microsoft's licensing agreement with OpenAI.\n\nAt a hearing on Wednesday, an Oakland federal court judge said she felt there was enough evidence that Musk may have been deceived to allow the case to move forward to a jury. A trial is scheduled for March.\n\n\"There were assurances made, and promises made, that the structure would be maintained,\" she said. \"There was lots of information that was not shared.\"\n\nThe judge added that she also felt \"there are strong arguments by the defense.\"\n\n\"I think the jury is going to get to decide,\" she said.\n\nOpenAI lawyers have denied Musk's allegations, saying Musk was aware of the company's for-profit plans as early as 2018. OpenAI has also pointed out that it is still controlled by OpenAI's nonprofit arm.\n\n\"Mr Musk's lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial,\" a spokesperson for OpenAI told Business Insider. \"We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best resourced nonprofits ever.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMusk has filed multiple lawsuits against OpenAI. Most recently, his AI company, xAI, sued OpenAI in September, accusing it of stealing trade secrets and targeting its employees for recruitment. At the time, an OpenAI spokesperson told Business that the lawsuit is \"the latest chapter in Mr. Musk's ongoing harassment.\"\n\nMusk helped found OpenAI in 2015, but left the company in 2018. At the time he said his work with OpenAI could present a conflict of interest with Tesla's AI ambitions.\n\nSince, Musk has repeatedly criticized Altman and OpenAI, including the company's structure. Musk later went on to launch his own AI company, xAI, in 2023.",

    "description": "Natalie Gialenes sued the city of Austin and ex-officer Joseph Spees, alleging a brutal takedown and traumatic brain injury during a 2024 arrest. Spees was fired over the incident last month.",
    "fullText": "The woman a former Austin police officer slammed to the ground during a 2024 arrest has filed a federal lawsuit against the officer and the City of Austin, alleging the incident amounted to “indefensible police brutality” and left her with a traumatic brain injury.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Monday, comes weeks after Austin Police Chief Lisa Davis indefinitely suspended — effectively firing — Officer Joseph Spees over his conduct during the arrest of Natalie Gialenes, who was visiting Austin from out of state.\n\nIn her complaint, Gialenes alleges she was standing outside her hotel on East Cesar Chavez Street during the early morning hours of Dec. 7, 2024, when Spees arrested her for public intoxication, a Class C misdemeanor punishable by a fine. According to the suit, Gialenes voluntarily placed her hands behind her back and did not resist being handcuffed.\n\nAs Spees escorted her toward his patrol car, Gialenes dropped her identification card on the ground and bent down to retrieve it, the lawsuit states. At that point, Spees abruptly used force, slamming her to the pavement.\n\n\"Rather than tell Ms. Gialenes to stop or stand up straight, allow her to pick up her identification off the ground, or use any de-escalation tactics of any kind whatsoever, Officer Spees grabbed the young woman by her upper arm without warning, lifted up on her arm to raise her up slung her around his body in almost a complete circle, and threw her to the ground,\" the complaint alleges.\n\nBecause her hands were cuffed behind her back, Gialenes was unable to break her fall and struck her head on the pavement, according to the lawsuit. She bled heavily and was later hospitalized with a traumatic brain injury, along with injuries to her face, chest and feet. The suit further alleges that Spees later shoved her head-first into the back seat of his patrol car, causing her to strike her head a second time, even as blood pooled on the ground in the hotel driveway.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning the city had not been served with the lawsuit, according to spokesperson Erik Johnson, who said in a prepared statement that officials would \"review it and respond appropriately.\" Austin Police Association President Michael Bullock, who often weighs in on personnel matters, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe incident was first made public last month when Davis released a 14-page disciplinary memo explaining her decision to indefinitely suspend Spees, who had worked for the department for 11 years. In the memo, Davis wrote that “any objectively reasonable officer — and especially an experienced and well-trained officer like Officer Spees — should have been able to handle minimal resistance without immediately resorting to a violent takedown that caused considerable injury.”\n\nAccording to the disciplinary memo, Spees told internal affairs investigators that one of Gialenes' hands slipped out of the handcuffs the officer placed her in, which represented a severe threat.\n\nBut Davis described the claims as dubious. \"I do not believe that any objectively reasonable officer could share Officer Spees' judgment that [Gialenes] posed a level 8 out of 10 threat while she was handcuffed and he was escorting her to his patrol car,\" the chief wrote in her memo.\n\nGialenes is represented by Austin civil rights attorney Jeff Edwards, who said in a news release that the incident reflects a broader pattern of excessive force within the department. As a result of Spees’ actions, Edwards said, Gialenes “suffered a painful and serious brain injury that will impact her for the rest of her life.”\n\n\"APD must do more than terminate the officer – it must acknowledge the department’s systematic wrongdoing, revamp its disciplinary system, and change its training immediately, or more people will continue to be senselessly injured by APD officers,\" Edwards said.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to include comment from the city of Austin",

    "description": "In 2025, a lawsuit was filed against The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, alleging that its negligence led to serious bodily injury to a minor. This week, the Church filed a response to the lawsuit, denying the allegations.",
    "fullText": "Editor’s Note: A lawsuit only portrays one side of a story.\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (ABC4) — In 2025, a lawsuit was filed against The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, alleging that its negligence led to serious bodily injury to a minor. This week, the Church filed a response to the lawsuit, denying the allegations.\n\nIn November 2025, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of two minors, who have not been identified due to their age, after one of the minors had sustained serious injuries during a church activity in 2022. At the time of the incident, the minors were 12 and 14 years old.\n\nA court-appointed conservator was assigned as the plaintiff on behalf of the two minor children. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was named as the defendant.\n\nThe juveniles were participating in an activity on a boat owned by their ward’s Young Women leader, according to the lawsuit. While on the boat, the 12-year-old was feeding out a rope to an inner tube when the young women’s leader reportedly accelerated.\n\nDue to the acceleration, the rope wrapped around the boy’s left foot and severed it below the ankle.\n\nThe Young Women’s leader reportedly turned the boat off but was unable to restart it because the engine flooded. The 12-year-old’s brother, who was 14 at the time and is the other minor involved in the lawsuit, called 911.\n\nThe brother had to apply a tourniquet to the injured leg and, with the help of others, attempted to paddle his brother to shore on the inner tube.\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE: Negligence lawsuit filed against Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints after child loses foot\n\nDespite additional medical attention, the 12-year-old’s foot could not be saved after undergoing two amputations. He also had to go through multiple surgeries.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the minor has sustained significant mental, emotional, and psychological trauma in addition to irreparable and life-altering harm. It also alleges that his brother sustained emotional and psychological injuries due to witnessing the incident and its impact on his brother.\n\nBecause it was a Church activity supervised by Church leaders, the plaintiffs argue that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had a responsibility and duty to the minors and breached that duty by failing to provide a safe environment and failing to properly train supervisory individuals.\n\nThe plaintiffs are asking for compensation to help both minors with medical treatment and emotional recovery, as well as for any loss of future and past enjoyment of life.\n\nOn Monday, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints filed a response to the initial lawsuit. While it admitted that some of its youth activities involve water sports and that the driver of the boat is in charge of some youth activities, it denied that it breached any of its obligations or legal responsibilities.\n\nThe Church also admitted that the adults who organized the activity were leaders within the church. However, they denied that the Young Women’s leader had increased the dangers of boating or that any injuries sustained were the result of acts, errors, or omissions by the Church.\n\nBased on Wyoming law’s due care requirements, the Church admitted it owed a duty of care to the minors but denied allegations that it breached that duty.\n\nHow to make ABC4 your preferred news source on Google\n\nIn its response, the Church argued that it bears no responsibility and that there are inherent risks of activities like watersports that it cannot prevent. It also argued that the plaintiff’s claims were barred by the volunteer immunity doctrine, which provides certain protections to individuals acting as volunteers.\n\nThe response reads, in part, “the injuries are the result of a rare and unforeseen accident that happened in the absence of negligence or lack of due care by the Defendant.”\n\nIt also says that the Church “prays plaintiff take nothing by way of the complaint” and asks the court to grant the defendant any relief that the court deems equitable.\n\nABC4 has reached out to the Church for a statement on the lawsuit and has not yet heard back.\n\nBig air, moguls, slopestyle: What to know about freestyle skiing at Winter Olympics\n\nShort track speedskating at the Winter Olympics: Here’s what to know\n\nUS star Pulisic having career year at AC Milan ahead of 2026 World Cup\n\nTunisia changes coach before World Cup after disappointing Africa Cup\n\nWorld Cup qualification shines as new objective for Congo after Africa Cup",

    "fullText": "Jan. 6 (UPI) -- NASCAR commissioner Steve Phelps will resign at the end of January, he announced Tuesday.\n\nHis departure comes amid fallout from an antitrust lawsuit, which revealed disparaging messages he sent during revenue-sharing negotiations.\n\nPhelps, 63, joined NASCAR in 2005 as vice president of corporate marketing and later served as chief marketing officer, senior vice president, executive vice president, chief operating officer and president. He was promoted to commissioner in March.\n\n\"As a lifelong race fan, it gives me immense pride to have served as NASCAR's first commissioner and to lead our great sport through so many incredible challenges, opportunities and firsts over my 20 years,\" Phelps said in a news release. \"Our sport is built on the passion of our fans, the dedication of our teams and partners, and the commitment of our wonderful employees.\n\n\"It has been an honor to help synthesize the enthusiasm of long-standing NASCAR stakeholders with that of new entrants to our ecosystem, such as media partners, auto manufacturers, track operators and incredible racing talent.\n\nFront Row Motorsports and 23XI Racing, owned by basketball legend Michael Jordan and NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin, sued NASCAR in federal antitrust case.\n\nThe discovery process during that lawsuit revealed several disparaging remarks through message sent from Phelps, with the commissioner calling NASCAR legend and team owner Richard Childress a \"stupid redneck\" in once instance. Phelps apologized to Childress during the trial, but his remarks drew harsh criticism from those connected to the sport.\n\nNACAR reached a settlement with the teams in December.\n\nThe racing league did not announce additional leadership or personnel changes and said Phelps' departure \"comes during a time of stability with an exceptional leadership team in place.\"\n\n\"Steve will forever be remembered as one of NASCAR's most impactful leaders,\" NASCAR chairman and CEO Jim France said. \"For decades he has worked tirelessly to thrill fans, support teams and execute a vision for the sport that has treated us all to some of the greatest moments in our nearly 80-year history.\n\n\"It's been an honor to work alongside him in achieving the impossible like being the first sport to return during COVID or in delivering the unimaginable by launching new races in the LA Memorial Coliseum and NASCAR's first-ever street race in downtown Chicago. Steve leaves NASCAR with a transformative legacy of innovation and collaboration with an unrelenting growth mindset.\"\n\nThe 2026 NASCAR Cup Series season will start with the Cook Out Clash at Bowman Gray Stadium on Feb. 1 in Winston-Salem, N.C. The 2026 Daytona 500 will be held Feb. 15 in Daytona Beach, Fla.",

    "fullText": "The captain of the Alaska Airlines plane that lost a panel midflight is suing Boeing, accusing it of trying to \"scapegoat\" the pilots.\n\nAttorneys for Brandon Fisher filed the lawsuit last Tuesday in an Oregon court, asking for $10 million in damages.\n\nBack in January 2024, Flight 1282 took off from Portland, bound for Ontario, California.\n\nBut at 16,000 feet, the Boeing 737 Max lost a door plug — a panel that covers a deactivated emergency exit.\n\nThe pilots declared an emergency and descended below 10,000 feet, so there was enough oxygen to breathe normally.\n\n\"But for Captain Fisher's heroism and immense display of composure under pressure, the outcome would have been catastrophic,\" the lawsuit said.\n\n\"Instead, Captain Fisher and First Officer [Emily] Wiprud executed a safe emergency landing despite chaotic conditions in the cockpit caused by the gaping hole in the left side of the aircraft.\"\n\nAn investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board later found that the plane had left Boeing's factory missing key bolts that would've secured the door plug.\n\nIt said that the fuselage arrived from the supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, with damaged rivets. Boeing workers removed the plug to repair them, but didn't put the bolts back in place, the NTSB found. This work wasn't properly documented, which also meant that there was no inspection that could've spotted the missing bolts, it said.\n\nSpirit AeroSystems is also named as a defendant in Fisher's suit. Boeing completed its acquisition of most of Spirit in December, with the aim of integrating its operations to gain greater control over its supply chain.\n\nFisher's suit said that, while defending a class-action lawsuit related to the incident, Boeing denied liability, saying its products were \"improperly maintained or misused by persons and/or entities other than Boeing.\"\n\n\"It was clear Boeing's words were directed at Captain Fisher in attempt to paint him as the scapegoat for Boeing's numerous failures,\" it said.\n\nThe suit says that Fisher suffered emotional distress as a result. \"Boeing's comments dramatically exacerbated the life-changing impacts that this incident caused Captain Fisher,\" it added.\n\nIn an internal memo, viewed by Business Insider, which was sent around shortly after the incident, the then-CEO of Boeing's commercial airplanes division, Stan Deal, told employees: \"We commend the pilots and cabin crew of Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 for their actions to safely land the plane.\"\n\nBoeing declined to comment when reached by Business Insider, citing the fact that the suit is pending litigation.\n\nAn Alaska Airlines spokesperson said, \"We have no comment on the lawsuit but remain grateful to our crewmembers for the bravery and quick thinking that they displayed on Flight 1282 in ensuring the safety of all on board.\"\n\nCorrection: January 6, 2025 — This post's headline has been amended. Brandon Fisher's lawsuit is against Boeing, not Alaska Airlines.",

    "fullText": "A former producer for the syndicated CBS news program \"Inside Edition\" has sued Paramount Global, claiming he was fired after complaining about repeated antisemitic comments by senior talent.\n\nJoshua Bernstein said Lisa Guerrero, then a correspondent on the program, called him a \"whiny Jew,\" \"spoiled Jew,\" and an \"old Jewish woman\" and asked how he could have married a Muslim woman or worked for a \"terrorist network\" like Al Jazeera.\n\nShe also called him homophobic slurs and made \"countless other racist and offensive comments\" about interview subjects and coworkers, Bernstein claimed in the lawsuit, which was filed earlier this month.\n\nA publicist for Guerrero, who left \"Inside Edition\" over the summer, shared a statement from CBS Media Ventures that referred to Bernstein's claims as unsubstantiated.\n\nBernstein also claimed that Charles Lachman, the show's executive producer, was known as a \"total homophobe\" and showed bias against Black people and Muslims. According to Bernstein's lawsuit, after Bernstein showed footage of an interview with a female graduate student wearing a hijab, Lachman said, \"Absolutely not! It looks like she's about to set off a bomb.\"\n\n\"On another occasion, plaintiff witnessed Mr. Lachman screaming at a female producer stating 'No! No! No! I don't want to see fat and ugly Kelly Clarkson! I want to see Kelly Clarkson in a short skirt!'\" lawyers for Bernstein wrote in the complaint.\n\nA representative for CBS Media Ventures, the Paramount Global unit that syndicates \"Inside Edition\" and other shows like \"Jeopardy!,\" denied Bernstein's claims.\n\n\"We are committed to a safe and respectful workplace for all,\" the representative wrote in an email. \"After receiving the initial claim letter, outside counsel immediately conducted an investigation, which found no evidence to support these allegations. We will address the matter in court and are committed to vigorously defending against any fabricated claims.\"\n\n\"Inside Edition\" is a tabloid-style syndicated news program that has been running since 1989, focusing on true crime and celebrity coverage, and is a top ratings-getter for CBS Media Ventures, with more than 3 million weekly viewers, according to Nielsen.\n\nCBS Media Ventures is distinct from CBS News, where Bari Weiss was recently named editor-in-chief.\n\nLachman has been its executive producer since the late 1990s, and longtime anchor Deborah Norville left the program last year, replaced by Eva Pilgrim. Bernstein's complaint said he worked there starting in 2019, that he had a medical episode in 2023, and that he was fired about a year later while on leave.\n\nBernstein's lawsuit also claims \"Inside Edition\" engaged in \"deliberate news distortion,\" including by rigging devices to burn and explode so that segments about fireworks, e-bike batteries, and gas grills made those devices appear more dangerous than they were. He claimed that after he learned an e-bike battery had been rigged to explode, senior investigative producer Charlie McLravy told him to \"keep [his] mouth shut and don't say anything to the lawyers.\"\n\nLachman and McLravy didn't reply to comment requests.",

    "fullText": "No one does fast food quite like McDonald’s. After all, that signature smell of fresh french fries wafting through the car after a trip to the drive through is hard to compare to anything else. Whether you’re going for a burger, nuggets or even just a sip of their crispy Coke, you can’t really go wrong with the fast food giant—unless you’re ordering the McRib. In December, a lawsuit was filed against McDonald’s by four individuals who claim the restaurant has been lying to customers regarding the meat that makes up this menu item. Here, read all there is to know about the McDonald’s class-action lawsuit.\n\nWhen you hear the name “McRib,” it’s fair to assume that what you’re consuming is going to be rib meat—but according to the plaintiffs behind this lawsuit, McDonald’s has been deceiving its customers. “Despite its name and distinctive shape—its meat patty has been deliberately crafted to resemble a rack of pork ribs—the McRib does not contain any actual pork rib meat at all,” claims the lawsuit. “Instead, its meat patty is reconstructed using ground-up portions of lower-grade pork products such as inter alia, pork shoulder, heart, tripe and scalded stomach.”\n\nWhile the sandwich is called the McRib, the McDonald’s website doesn't explicitly say the menu item contains rib meat. Instead, among the ingredients listed for the McRib is a McRib Pork Patty, alongside McRib sauce, pickles and onions on a homestyle bun. “The McRib starts with seasoned boneless pork dipped in a tangy BBQ sauce, topped with slivered onions and tangy pickles, all served on a toasted homestyle bun,” states their website.\n\nThe individuals behind the lawsuit argue that including the word “rib” in the item’s name indicates that the sandwich consists of “at least some meaningful quantity of actual pork rib meat.”\n\nThe current McDonald’s class-action McRib lawsuit  is not the first lawsuit the fast food giant has dealt with, but they recently responded to the claims at hand. “This lawsuit distorts the facts and many of the claims are inaccurate,” they told NBC Chicago. \"Food quality and safety are at the heart of everything we do—that’s why we’re committed to using real, quality ingredients across our entire menu. Our fan-favorite McRib sandwich is made with 100% pork sourced from farmers and suppliers across the US. We’ve always been transparent about our ingredients so guests can make the right choice for them.”\n\nAt this point in time, the people behind the lawsuit are asking that those who have purchased a McRib within the last four years receive class certification and later, “compensatory damages, restitution, and injunctive relief.” Whether you're a McRib fan or not, staying informed about what's in your food helps you make the best choices for you and your family. And if you're craving that tangy BBQ flavor? Now you know exactly what you're getting.\n\nLooking for more trending stories?

    "fullText": "Two conservation groups are suing Alaska's Board of Game over a program that authorizes helicopter shooting of both brown bears and black bears across a sprawling 40,000-square-mile zone in the state's southwest.\n\nAs the Center for Biological Diversity detailed, it brought the case before the state superior court alongside the Alaska Wildlife Alliance, claiming the Mulchatna bear control program violates Alaska's constitutional requirement to manage wildlife sustainably.\n\nThe state's highest court has previously ruled this provision covers all wildlife, bears included.\n\nUnder a previous version of this program, state officials shot 175 brown bears and another five black bears over the 2023-2024 season.\n\nThe reinstated program allows officials to shoot bears regardless of age, with no limit on how many can be killed, through 2028.\n\nThe targeted area lies just miles from Lake Clark National Preserve and Katmai National Park, putting bears that travel across protected and unprotected territory at risk.\n\n\"This is a disgraceful misuse of public resources and a betrayal of the trust Alaskans place in their wildlife managers,\" said Cooper Freeman, Alaska director at the Center for Biological Diversity.\n\n\"State officials should protect all of our wildlife for future generations, not flaunt their power by orchestrating the mass killing of iconic bears with no scientific basis.\"\n\nThe program has caused outrage on social media.\n\n\"Stop letting politicians run natural resources programs,\" one Instagram commenter wrote. \"Hand them to biologists.\"\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nAnother pleaded, \"This should never happen! Please save the bears and other wildlife!\"\n\nA state court already invalidated an earlier version of this program in March 2025, ruling it was adopted without reliable scientific information about how many bears actually live in the region.\n\nMonths later, state officials reinstated it without first gathering the population data that the ruling had called for.\n\nBears are irreplaceable to their ecosystems, carrying seeds and distributing nutrients across wide areas. A program that lacks both kill caps and population counts could throw wildlife numbers off balance across the region and affect nearby communities and protected lands.\n\nAccording to the Royal Society, \"Biodiversity is essential for the processes that support all life on Earth, including humans.\"\n\nA shift in the natural order can impact everything from water and air quality to the human food supply.\n\nPredators, such as bears, are essential for controlling prey populations. In Scotland, for example, experts are considering reintroducing wolves to reduce the number of deer, which are growing out of control and preventing the growth of important shrubs.\n\n\"How we treat our animals, our elders, our veterans, and our most vulnerable shows us exactly who we are as a country,\" one Instagram user commented.\n\nIf you want to support bear protection efforts, donate to or volunteer with the Alaska Wildlife Alliance or Center for Biological Diversity.\n\nMeanwhile, contacting Alaska state legislators to oppose predator control programs that lack scientific backing can help inform lawmakers of public perception.\n\nSharing information about this lawsuit with friends and family can also encourage public pressure for wildlife protections based on science, not politics.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — California this week dropped a lawsuit officials filed against the Trump administration over the federal government's withdrawing of $4 billion for the state's long-delayed high-speed rail project.\n\nThe U.S. Transportation Department slashed funds for the bullet train aimed at connecting San Francisco to Los Angeles in July. The Trump administration has said the California High-Speed Rail Authority had “ no viable plan ” to complete a large segment of the project in the farm-rich Central Valley.\n\nThe authority quickly filed a lawsuit, with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom calling the federal government's decision “a political stunt to punish California.”\n\nThe authority said this week that it would focus on other funding sources to complete the project, which is estimated to cost more than $100 billion.\n\n“This action reflects the State’s assessment that the federal government is not a reliable, constructive, or trustworthy partner in advancing high-speed rail in California,” an authority spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe Transportation Department did not respond to a request for comment. President Donald Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have both previously criticized the project as a “train to nowhere.”\n\n“The Railroad we were promised still does not exist, and never will,” Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social in July. “This project was Severely Overpriced, Overregulated, and NEVER DELIVERED.”\n\nThe authority's decision to drop the lawsuit comes as the group seeks private investors to support the bullet train. The project recently secured $1 billion in annual funding from the state's cap-and-trade program through 2045.\n\nThe program sets a declining limit on total planet-warming emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their emissions. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.\n\nThe rail authority said its shift in focus away from federal funding offers “a new opportunity.”\n\n“Moving forward without the Trump administration’s involvement allows the Authority to pursue proven global best practices used successfully by modern high-speed rail systems around the world,” a spokesperson said in a statement.",

    "description": "The family claimed in the lawsuit that the incident \"ruined their family vacation\" and caused embarrassment, inconvenience, and medical expenses.",
    "fullText": "There's no shortage of flight horror stories, but a bed bug infestation sounds particularly unsettling.\n\nThe Albuquerque's, a family of four from Virginia, filed a lawsuit against Delta and KLM on December 18 after they said they experienced a \"bed bug infestation\" on a flight from March 21.\n\n\"While aboard a Delta and KLM flight across the Atlantic, the entire Albuquerque Family was bitten and injured by bed bugs that had infested the cabin of the plane,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nThe family claimed in the lawsuit that the bites led to \"raised and itchy welts, lesions, and rashes across their torsos and extremities.\"\n\nThe lawsuit said the family wishes to be compensated for the incident, which \"ruined their family vacation\" and caused \"embarrassment, anxiety, discomfort, inconvenience, medical expenses, and loss of clothing and personal items.\"\n\nThe Albuquerque's took a Delta flight from Roanoke to Atlanta, then a KLM flight to Amsterdam, and then to Belgrade, Serbia, according to the lawsuit. The family had planned a vacation to Serbia to visit family and friends, the lawsuit stated.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Delta said that \"the allegations at issue relate to flights not operated by Delta Air Lines.\" The airline added that it will \"review the complaint and respond accordingly in due course.\"\n\nThe filing states the flights were round-trip and business class, purchased through Delta's SkyMiles program, and operated by KLM. The four tickets were worth $8,800 at the time, according to the suit.\n\nRoughly two hours into the flight to Amsterdam, one of the plaintiffs started to feel like she was being bitten by bugs crawling on her, according to the filing. She then realized that bugs were \"crawling on her light-colored sweater,\" the filing stated.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the couple \"immediately\" notified the flight staff and were told to keep their voices down to avoid causing \"panic\" on the plane. The couple took photos and videos of the bugs crawling on the sweater and in the creases of their seats, which were included in the lawsuit.\n\nPrior to landing, the flight attendants urged the couple again not to tell anyone about the infestation because they would miss their connecting flight to Serbia if they did, the filing stated.\n\nA little over a week after the incident, the couple took their children to doctors in Roanoke, Virginia, where it was confirmed that the bites were caused by bed bugs, the lawsuit said. The family was recommended to employ \"bug bombs\" in their home and car, and wash their clothing in hot water, the filing said.\n\nWhile bed bugs are an unusual complaint, this isn't the first time passengers have turned to the courts after a bad flight experience. In September, 16 passengers sued American Airlines after their flight caught fire. Last year, a passenger sued Delta for $1 million, alleging a faulty armrest broke his rib.\n\nKLM did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to reallocate federal Homeland Security funding away from states that refuse to cooperate with certain federal immigration enforcement.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mary McElroy's ruling on Monday solidified a win for the coalition of 12 attorneys general that sued the administration earlier this year after being alerted that their states would receive drastically reduced federal grants due to their “sanctuary” jurisdictions.\n\nIn total, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency reduced more than $233 million from Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. The money is part of a $1 billion program where allocations are supposed to be based on assessed risks, with states then largely passing most of the money on to police and fire departments.\n\nThe cuts were unveiled shortly after a separate federal judge in a different legal challenge ruled it was unconstitutional for the federal government to require states to cooperate on immigration enforcement actions to get FEMA disaster funding.\n\nIn her 48-page ruling, McElroy found that the federal government was weighing states' police on federal immigration enforcement on whether to reduce federal funding for the Homeland Security Grant Program and others.\n\n“What else could defendants’ decisions to cut funding to specific counterterrorism programming by conspicuous round numbered amounts — including by slashing off the millions-place digits of awarded sums — be if not arbitrary and capricious? Neither a law degree nor a degree in mathematics is required to deduce that no plausible, rational formula could produce this result,” McElroy wrote.\n\nThe Trump-appointed judge then ordered the Department of Homeland Security to restore the previously announced funding allocations to the plaintiff states.\n\n“Defendants’ wanton abuse of their role in federal grant administration is particularly troublesome given the fact that they have been entrusted with a most solemn duty: safeguarding our nation and its citizens,\" McElroy wrote. \"While the intricacies of administrative law and the terms and conditions on federal grants may seem abstract to some, the funding at issue here supports vital counterterrorism and law enforcement programs.”\n\nMcElroy notably cited the recent Brown University attack, where a gunman killed two students and injured nine others, as an event where the $1 billion federal program would be vital in responding to such a tragedy.\n\n“To hold hostage funding for programs like these based solely on what appear to be defendants’ political whims is unconscionable and, at least here, unlawful,” the Rhode Island-based judge wrote in her ruling, issued little more than a week after the Brown shooting.\n\nDHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the department plans on fighting the order.\n\n“This judicial sabotage threatens the safety of our states, counties, towns, and weakens the entire nation,\" McLaughlin said. \"We will fight to restore these critical reforms and protect American lives.”\n\nMeanwhile, attorneys general who sued the administration applauded the order.\n\n“This victory ensures that the Trump Administration cannot punish states that refuse to help carry out its cruel immigration agenda, particularly by denying them lifesaving funding that helps prepare for and respond to disasters and emergencies,” said Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell in a statement.",

It further asserts that the infestation caused “severe and permanent emotional distress, humiliation, mental anguish, indignity, loss of pleasures and enjoyment of life,” which will require psychological and psychiatric treatment.\n\nThe infestation also required the victims to spend money on medical care, and caused lost wages, according to the suit.\n\nThe bites from the bugs caused severe injuries, the lawsuit claims, which caused a “significant amount of pain and suffering.”\n\nThe guests are suing for damages and legal costs.",

The governing bodies deny liability.\n\nIn a previous hearing, Susan Rodway KC for the players said the order to provide medical records was \"impossible, onerous and costly\".\n\nBut a High Court judge has refused the appeal, saying the order is \"not disproportionate, oppressive, irrational or legally perverse\".\n\nRylands Garth, the law firm bringing the case, said it is grateful to the judge for providing clarity and that it would comply with the court's orders.\n\nJudge Dexter Dias said orders issued in February 2024 and 2025 which required the claimants to hand over medical records and all documents from neurological testing were proportionate and necessary to manage the litigation.\n\nWorld Rugby, the RFU and the WRU said in a joint statement that \"player welfare remains a central priority for rugby and we shall not stand still in this space\".\n\nSteve Thompson, Mark Regan and Phil Vickery - part of England's 2003 Rugby World Cup-winning squad - former Wales stars Gavin Henson, Colin Charvis and Ryan Jones and ex-England and British and Lions scrum-half Harry Ellis are among those seeking damages from World Rugby, the RFU and the WRU.\n\nIn November, former British and Irish Lions Lee Byrne and Phil Greening were confirmed to have joined the concussion lawsuit.\n\nIn their joint statement, the governing bodies said: \"The judgement expressed concern that there has been a serious erosion of the court's confidence in the way the disclosure process has been conducted, and noted that effective and fair disclosure of the relevant documents was 'indispensable' in the context of the case.\n\n\"As such many players in the case are at risk of having their claims struck out.\"\n\nRylands Garth is being investigated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority over former England prop Will Green's claims that the firm attempted to pressurise him into joining the action despite him obtaining a second, independent diagnosis that showed no sign of brain injury.\n\nThe case is scheduled to be reviewed again in March 2026.",

    "fullText": "Toyota can’t seem to catch a break in court lately. Last month, the company dealt with a $5.7-billion lawsuit over the hydrogen-powered Mirai, with owners saying the car was basically unusable because there’s nowhere to refuel. Now, Toyota’s back in the hot seat, but this time it’s about something significantly more common: automatic transmissions.\n\nThe latest lawsuit was filed this month in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, led by a Camry owner named James LeBoutheller. He says his car’s transmission started acting up, but every time he brought it to the dealer, he was told it was just “normal operation.” Only after things got worse did someone finally find metal shavings in the transmission fluid – a clear sign something inside had failed. By that point, Toyota apparently refused to pay for the full repair.\n\nThe lawsuit claims Toyota kept selling cars with a known transmission defect and didn’t warn buyers about the risk.\n\nThe heart of the issue is Toyota’s UA80 eight-speed automatic. According to the lawsuit, it’s got both a mechanical flaw and software that doesn’t help matters. The result? Too much heat, parts wearing out early, and transmissions that eventually give up. It is said that the transmission is “predisposed to premature failure” due to overheating, degraded fluid, and internal component wear, which may occasionally cause stalling or loss of power.\n\nThe lawsuit covers a wide range of vehicles, including:\n\nToyota Highlander (2017–present)\n\nToyota Grand Highlander (2023–present)\n\nLexus NX 250 / NX 350 (2022–present)\n\nOwners say Toyota tried to quietly fix the problem with service bulletins and behind-the-scenes updates, all while still advertising these cars as reliable.\n\nThis isn’t just a one-off case, either. Earlier this month, another class-action lawsuit popped up in California, asking for about $5 million over the same UA80 transmission. The complaints are almost identical: Toyota knew about the problem, repairs cost a fortune once the warranty runs out, and help from the company is hit or miss.\n\nIn both cases, owners point to online complaints, NHTSA filings, and dealership acknowledgments as evidence that Toyota was well aware of the issue. The Texas lawsuit expands the scope by pushing for nationwide class certification and broader remedies, including warranty extensions or recalls.\n\nWhat happens next is fairly predictable. Toyota is expected to file a motion to dismiss or narrow the claims, while plaintiffs will push for discovery to access internal documents. Whether these cases gain traction or eventually consolidate remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the UA80 transmission isn’t done causing headaches, for owners or for Toyota.\n\nView the 4 images of this gallery on the original article",

    "description": "An Asheville father has sued Mission Hospital and an employee who was driving a company vehicle when he allegedly struck and killed a cyclist.",
    "fullText": "ASHEVILLE - An Asheville father has filed a lawsuit against Mission Hospital and one of its employees after the employee allegedly struck and killed his son on Swannanoa River Road while driving a company vehicle.\n\nMichael Rozos, the father of Alexander Rozos, filed the lawsuit Dec. 18 in Buncombe County Superior Court against the driver, Mauricio Roberto Melgar Delgado, HCA Healthcare, Mission Hospital and its parent companies.\n\nAn Asheville Police Department investigation showed Alexander Rozos was riding a bicycle west along Swannanoa River Road around 11:42 a.m. July 18, 2024, while a driver identified as Delgado, 48, was driving a white box truck in the same direction behind him. After both Rozos and Delgado passed through the intersection of South Tunnel Road, Delgado overtook Rozos, fatally striking and running him over, an APD incident report confirms.\n\nThe lawsuit reveals that at the time of the crash, Delgado was driving a 2019 Kenworth truck – owned by HCA – “within the course and scope of his employment” with Mission Hospital. Rozos' attorney, Thomas Killoren Jr., described the vehicle as a \"20,000-pound, large delivery vehicle.\"\n\nDelgado drove the truck away before officers arrived, and Alexander Rozos died at the scene of the collision, the Citizen Times previously reported.\n\nRozos was a Haw Creek resident, cyclist and athlete who had been recruited by the military on a fast track to the United States Army Special Forces, his father previously told the Citizen Times. An avid climber, Rozos was riding to a climbing gym when he was struck, Michael Rozos said.\n\n\"He was riding his bike to work and was hit and killed for absolutely no reason. Where do you start to describe the loss that these parents have experienced? It's just devastating and it must stop,\" Killoren Jr. told the Citizen Times Dec. 19.\n\nThe lawsuit claims negligence and wrongful death by Delgado, along with vicarious liability and negligent hiring and supervision by Mission Hospital and HCA. The lawsuit cited a legal doctrine called respondeat superior, which holds an employer legally responsible for the wrongful acts of an employee.\n\n“HCA Defendants are vicariously liable for the negligent, careless, and reckless acts and omissions of their employee/agent,” the lawsuit said.\n\nThe HCA defendants were negligent in hiring and supervision by either failing to have policies in place to train and monitor their drivers or failing to enforce them, the lawsuit claims. The suit also alleges the company failed to have or enforce drivers’ compliance with motor vehicle laws and failed to have or implement an adequate safety program for the “safety and protection of the motoring public.”\n\nMore: Asheville police find, charge driver in hit-and-run death of cyclist; victim named\n\nThe lawsuit goes on to further claim that HCA and Mission Hospital failed to properly investigate Delgado’s driving record and ensure he had the right training, credentials and skills to drive a company vehicle. HCA and Mission Hospital “knew or should have known” Delgado could not drive a vehicle safely and effectively, the lawsuit claims.\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking a jury trial and damages to cover hospital bills, funeral expenses and compensation for pain and suffering.\n\nMission Hospital spokesperson Nancy Lindell did not respond to Citizen Times questions sent Dec. 19, including whether Delgado is still employed by Mission and what guidelines the hospital and HCA have in place for hiring and training drivers.\n\nDelgado was indicted to Buncombe County Superior Court on Nov. 4, 2024, under a charge of felony hit and run inflicting serious injury or death.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Attorneys for President Donald Trump urged a federal judge on Friday to rule that Trump is entitled to presidential immunity from civil claims that he instigated a mob's attack on the U.S. Capitol to stop Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 election.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta didn't rule from the bench after hearing arguments from Trump attorneys and lawyers for Democratic members of Congress who sued the Republican president and allies over the Jan. 6. 2021, attack.\n\nTrump spoke to a crowd of his supporters at the “Stop the Steal” rally near the White House before the mob’s attack disrupted the joint session of Congress for certifying Democratic President Joe Biden’s electoral victory.\n\nTrump's attorneys argue that his conduct leading up to Jan. 6 and on the day of the riot is protected by presidential immunity because he was acting in his official capacity.\n\n“The entire point of immunity is to give the president clarity to speak in the moment as the commander-in-chief,” Trump attorney Joshua Halpern told the judge.\n\nThe lawmakers' lawyers argue Trump can't prove he was acting entirely in his official capacity rather than as an office-seeking private individual. And office-seekers aren't entitled to presidential immunity, they contend.\n\n“President Trump has the burden of proof here,” said plaintiffs' attorney Joseph Sellers. “We submit that he hasn't come anywhere close to satisfying that burden.”\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who chaired the House Homeland Security Committee, sued Trump, his personal attorney Rudolph Giuliani and members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers extremist groups over the Jan. 6 riot. Other Democratic members of Congress later joined the litigation.\n\nThe civil claims survived Trump's sweeping act of clemency on the first day of his second term, when he pardoned, commuted prison sentences and ordered the dismissal of all 1,500-plus criminal cases stemming from the Capitol siege.",

    "fullText": "The nation's largest HR trade group has been sued by a woman who alleges it revoked a job offer because it didn't want her medical service dog in the office.\n\nThe lawsuit filed Tuesday by Fiona Torres against the Society for Human Resource Management says she is diabetic, and the dog can detect changes in her blood-sugar levels faster and more reliably than a top-tier glucose monitor.\n\nSHRM says it \"fully complied\" with the Americans with Disabilities Act in offering Torres an alternative \"reasonable accommodation\" for her health condition.\n\nTorres' lawsuit was filed less than two weeks after SHRM was ordered to pay $11.5 million in an unrelated race discrimination and retaliation case.\n\nThe new complaint alleges that in June 2024, SHRM offered Torres a role as a senior specialist in its product management department at its office in Alexandria, Virginia, then revoked the offer in July because she wanted to bring her dog to work.\n\nTorres said SHRM's offer to accommodate her medical needs was to allow her to keep food, water, and an insulin pump at her desk, which she felt was insufficient.\n\n\"I was ready and able to work,\" Torres said in an email to Business Insider through her attorney. \"They said they were eager to have me until they found out I had a disability and a service dog.\"\n\nThe complaint quotes an email from SHRM to Torres denying her accommodation request.\n\n\"[I]t does not appear there are any reasonable accommodations that would allow you to perform the essential functions of the role,\" SHRM wrote, according to the complaint.\n\nSHRM spokesman Eddie Burke declined to comment on the specifics of the suit, saying the organization was still reviewing the legal papers.\n\n\"We support the ADA and are actively committed to supporting employees through fair, respectful, and legally compliant accommodation processes,\" he said. \"We fully complied with the ADA in this matter and, in consultation with outside legal counsel, met all of our obligations to provide reasonable accommodations to Fiona Torres.\"\n\nLori Kisch, a lawyer for Torres, told Business Insider that SHRM's alleged conduct was \"ironic\" given that it provides information and resources to help HR professionals follow laws such as the ADA.\n\n\"They can't argue that they don't understand the law, and their actions are a reckless indifference to the law,\" she said.\n\nTorres' case, filed in federal court in Virginia, follows a lawsuit brought by a former SHRM employee that alleged race discrimination and retaliation. Rehab Mohamed, a Black and Egyptian instructional designer, claimed her SHRM manager held her to higher standards than white employees. A jury found SHRM liable for $11.5 million in damages.\n\nSHRM has said it plans to file an appeal and that the verdict \"does not reflect the facts, the law, or the truth of how\" it operates.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Lawsuit is the first UK case of its kind, with Ros and Mark Dowey accusing Meta of ‘putting profit before our young people’\n\nThe parents of a 16-year-old who took his own life after he fell victim to a sextortion gang on Instagram are suing Meta for the alleged wrongful death of their son, in the first UK case of its kind.\n\nMurray Dowey died in December 2023 at his family home in Dunblane, after being tricked into sending intimate pictures to an Instagram contact. He thought it was a girl his own age, but it turned out to be overseas criminals involved in financially motivated sexual extortion.\n\nSpeaking as the lawsuit was filed in Delaware, where Meta Platforms is incorporated, Murray’s parents Ros and Mark said: “We know what we’re up against. But it’s time social media companies took accountability for what they’ve done to our young people.\n\n“It’s not just sextortion, they’re causing multiple harms, and they’ve been allowed to get away with it.”\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in Delaware superior court by the US-based Social Media Victims Law Center on behalf of the Doweys, as well as the family of Levi Maciejewski, a 13-year-old from Pennsylvania who was also a victim of sextortion.\n\nIt states that the boys’ deaths were “the foreseeable result of Meta’s design decisions and repeated refusals to implement affordable, available and identified safety features due to Meta’s prioritisation of engagement over user safety”.\n\nAccording to the complaint, these design flaws include “collection of personal data without informed consent”, and use of that data to program recommendation products “it knew [were] operating in a manner that recommended teen Instagram users to sextortionists who Meta itself already had identified as predators”.\n\nThe suit alleges Meta’s “failure to safeguard user privacy, including through its continued sharing of Follower and Following data … even after Meta knew that this engagement-focused product feature was resulting in sextortion-related deaths of teen users across the world”.\n\nIt also contends that Meta made “false and misleading statements designed to convince children and parents that Instagram was safe for teens at the same time that internal testing showed that Instagram was matchmaking children to adult predators”.\n\nWhile four British parents are suing TikTok for the alleged wrongful deaths of their children as a result of attempting the viral “blackout challenge” in 2021, this is the first UK case to centre on the crime of sextortion.\n\nCases have risen sharply in recent years across the UK, US and Australia, with teenage boys and young men typically the victims of loosely organised cybercriminal gangs often based in south-east Asia and west Africa.\n\nEarlier this year, the Guardian reported that children as young as 11 to 13 were being targeted for the first time, as criminals behind extortion attempts cast their nets wider in an attempt to trap victims.\n\nThe Doweys’ lawyer, Matthew Bergman, who set up the Social Media Victims Law Center in 2021, said Meta was involved in all the US-based sextortion cases that he had filed to date.\n\n“There are reasons for that. It is a product defect issue and Meta knows it. This complaint cites Meta records only recently made known to the public through [previous joint civil proceedings] and those documents make the deliberateness of these design defects, lack of safeguards, and failures to warn clear,” he said.\n\nReflecting on the two years since his son’s passing, Mark Dowey said: “Nothing’s really changed since Murray died. These predators can still get at our children.”\n\nAs well as their battle to hold Meta to account, Ros and Mark have regularly spoken out about the dangers of sextortion in the hope of raising awareness among parents and young people.\n\nRos said: “As a parent who has first-hand experience of how devastating the flaws can be, you have a duty to warn other parents. You think your kids are safe looking at pictures on Instagram and they’re not.”\n\nMark said that the lawsuit was “a way to get a wee bit of justice for Murray”: “There has to be accountability here because those statements are absolutely damning. [Meta] have known that their products are killing children by their unsafe design and they haven’t done anything about it. They chose to put profit before our young people.”\n\nInstagram, which has previously condemned sextortion as a “horrific” crime, rolled out new safety features – which included preventing screenshots or screen recordings of disappearing images and videos – specifically to protect children from scammers in October 2024.\n\nMeta announced last October that accounts it detects as showing signals of suspicious behaviour would not be able to see people’s follower or following lists, removing their ability to exploit this feature, and would be blocked from being able to request to follow teens.\n\nIn June alone, accounts were blocked one million times. This July, it introduced new block and report features for direct messages.\n\nA spokesperson for Meta said: “Sextortion is a horrific crime. We support law enforcement to prosecute the criminals behind it and we continue to fight them on our apps on multiple fronts.\n\n“Since 2021, we’ve placed teens under 16 into private accounts when they \n\n“We work to prevent accounts showing suspicious behaviour from following teens and avoid recommending teens to them.\n\n“We also take other precautionary steps, like blurring potentially sensitive images sent in DMs and reminding teens of the risks of sharing them, and letting people know when they’re chatting to someone who may be in a different country.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration said in a court filing Monday that the president’s White House ballroom construction project must continue for unexplained national security reasons and because a preservationists' organization that wants it stopped has no standing to sue.\n\nThe filing was in response to a lawsuit filed last Friday by the National Trust for Historic Preservation asking a federal judge to halt President Donald Trump's project until it goes through multiple independent reviews and a public comment period and wins approval from Congress.\n\nThe administration's 36-page filing included a declaration from Matthew C. Quinn, deputy director of the U.S. Secret Service, the agency responsible for the security of the president and other high-ranking officials, that said more work on the site of the former White House East Wing is still needed to meet the agency’s “safety and security requirements.” The filing did not explain the specific national security concerns; the administration has offered to share classified details with the judge in a private, in-person setting without the plaintiffs present.\n\nThe East Wing had sat atop a emergency operations bunker for the president.\n\nQuinn said even a temporary halt to construction would “consequently hamper” the agency's ability to fulfill its statutory obligations and its protective mission.\n\nA hearing in the case was scheduled for Tuesday in federal court in Washington.\n\nThe government’s response offered the most comprehensive look yet at the ballroom construction project, including a window into how it was so swiftly approved by the Trump administration bureaucracy and its expanding scope.\n\nThe filings assert that final plans for the ballroom have yet to be finalized despite the continuing demolition and other work to prepare the site for eventual construction. Below-ground work on the site continues, wrote John Stanwich, the National Park Service’s liaison to the White House, and work on the foundations is set to begin in January. Above-ground construction “is not anticipated to begin until April 2026, at the earliest,” he wrote.\n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation did not respond to email messages seeking comment.\n\nThe privately funded group last week asked the U.S. District Court to block Trump's project.\n\n“No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever — not President Trump, not President Biden, and not anyone else,” the lawsuit states. “And no president is legally allowed to construct a ballroom on public property without giving the public the opportunity to weigh in.”\n\nTrump had the East Wing torn down in October as part of his plan to build an estimated $300 million, 90,000-square-foot (27,432-square-meter) ballroom able to accommodate about 1,000 people before his term ends in January 2029. He says presidents before him long have wanted an event space larger than the rooms currently at the White House, and says the ballroom would end the practice of entertaining visiting foreign dignitaries in large, temporary pavilions on the south grounds.\n\nThe Trust asserts that the plans should have been submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission, the Commission of Fine Arts and Congress before any action was taken. The lawsuit notes that the Trust wrote to those entities and the National Park Service on Oct. 21, after East Wing demolition began, urging a stop to the project and asking the administration to comply with federal law, but received no response.\n\nThe lawsuit cites several federal statutes and rules detailing the role the planning and fine arts commission and lawmakers play in U.S. government construction projects.\n\nThe administration argued in its response that the president has the authority to modify the White House and included the extensive history of changes and additions to the Executive Mansion since it was built more than 200 years ago. It also asserted that the president is not subject to the statutes cited by the plaintiffs.\n\nDepartment of Justice attorneys said in the filing that the plaintiff's claims about the East Wing demolition are “moot” because the tear-down cannot be undone. The administration also argues that claims about future construction are “unripe” because the plans are not final.\n\nThe administration also contends that the Trust cannot establish “irreparable harm” because above-ground construction is not expected until spring. It argues that the reviews sought in the lawsuit, consultation with the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, “will soon be underway without this Court's involvement.”\n\nTrump's ballroom project has prompted criticism in the historic preservation and architectural communities, and among his political adversaries, but the lawsuit is the most tangible effort thus far to alter or stop his plans for an addition that itself would be nearly twice the size of the White House before the East Wing was torn down.\n\nIn 2000, the National Park Service's Comprehensive Design Plan for the White House first identified the need for a larger event space to address an increase in visitors and to provide a venue suitable for major events, according to the administration's filing.",

It included parts of his Jan. 6, 2021, speech, which took place before some of Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol as Congress was poised to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election that Trump falsely alleged was stolen from him.\n\nThe BBC spliced together three quotes from two sections of the speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell.” Among the parts cut out was a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.\n\nThe BBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, accusing it of defamation over editing of his Jan. 6 speech\n\nTrump filed a lawsuit Monday seeking $10 billion in damages from the BBC, accusing the British broadcaster of defamation as well as deceptive and unfair trade practices.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses the BBC of broadcasting a “false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction of President Trump,” calling it “a brazen attempt to interfere in and influence” the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\n\nIt accused the BBC of “splicing together two entirely separate parts of President Trump’s speech on January 6, 2021” in order to ”intentionally misrepresent the meaning of what President Trump said.”\n\nAbrego Garcia is still hoping to find justice after his wrongful deportation, his lawyer says\n\nKilmar Abrego Garcia wasn’t an activist and he didn’t choose to become locked into what has become one of the most contentious immigration issues of the Trump administration, his lawyer told The Associated Press.\n\nBut as he experiences some of the few days he’s had with his family since being sent erroneously to an El Salvador prison in March, his lawyer said he’s still hoping for a just resolution to his case.\n\n“He’s been through a lot, and he’s still fighting,” said his lawyer Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg during an interview with AP following Abrego Garcia’s court-ordered release from detention last week. “What it is he can fight for is circumscribed by the law and by the great power of the United States government, but he’s still fighting.”\n\nAbrego Garcia’s mistaken deportation to El Salvador helped galvanize opposition to Trump’s immigration policies. He was held in a notoriously brutal prison there despite having no criminal record.\n\n▶ Read more about Abrego Garcia’s case\n\nSen. Mark Kelly’s attorney warns Trump administration of ‘dangerous overreach’\n\nThe attorney’s letter comes as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered a review of the Democratic senator who was among a group of lawmakers in a video calling on military personnel to defy “illegal orders.”\n\n“There is no legitimate basis for any type of proceeding against Senator Kelly, and any such effort would be unconstitutional and an extraordinary abuse of power,” wrote Paul J. Fishman in the letter to Navy Secretary John Phelan.\n\nTrump himself had lashed out at the lawmakers, who all have military backgrounds after years of service.\n\nKelly’s attorney warned of legal action if the department sought to pursue the senator in any forum — “criminal, disciplinary, or administrative.”\n\nFishman wrote they would “take all appropriate legal action on Senator Kelly’s behalf to halt the Administration’s unprecedented and dangerous overreach.”\n\nSecret Service official says ballroom construction doesn’t yet meet agency’s security standards\n\nIn its Monday court filing, the Trump administration included a declaration from the deputy director of the U.S. Secret Service saying more work on the site of the former White House East Wing is still needed to meet the agency’s “safety and security requirements.”\n\nThe administration has offered to share classified details with the judge in-person without the plaintiffs present.\n\nThe project has prompted criticism in the historic preservation and architectural communities, and among Trump’s political adversaries, but the lawsuit by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a privately funded group, is the most tangible effort thus far to alter or stop the 90,000-square-foot (8,361-square-meter) addition.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to block construction until the project goes through comprehensive design reviews, environmental assessments, public comments and congressional debate and ratification.\n\nTrump administration says White House ballroom construction is a matter of national security\n\nFor that reason, the construction project must continue, the Trump administration said in a court filing Monday.\n\nThe filing came in response to a lawsuit filed last Friday by the National Trust for Historic Preservation asking a federal judge to halt the project until it goes through multiple independent reviews and wins approval from Congress.\n\nExecutive order directs whole of government mobilization against drug traffickers\n\nThe order instructs the State and Treasury departments to pursue the financial assets of and sanctions on financial institutions and groups involved in fentanyl trafficking. It also calls for greater cooperation between the Pentagon and Justice Department on fentanyl and drug trafficking issues.\n\nThe order directs the homeland security secretary to “identify threat networks related to fentanyl smuggling” by using intelligence resources that in the past were devoted to the detection of other weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe federal government by law has a wide range of national security and law enforcement capabilities to combat drug smuggling, including asset forfeiture, targeted arrests and surveillance of criminal organizations.\n\nThe Trump administration’s earlier this year designated some drug cartels as terror groups, a move that may unlock more coordination between the armed forces and domestic law enforcement but has been questioned by legal analysts over its scope and legality.\n\nWisconsin judge allows case against former Trump aides to proceed to trial\n\nA Wisconsin judge has ruled there is enough evidence to proceed to trial in a felony forgery case against an attorney and an aide to President Donald Trump related to action taken after 2020 election.\n\nThe judge on Monday at a preliminary hearing found there was probable cause to proceed with the charges after taking testimony from a special agent with the state Department of Justice who detailed the allegations.\n\nThe charges relate to attempts by the former aides to present a slate of Republican electors to Congress falsely claiming that Trump had won Wisconsin that year.\n\nFormer Trump attorney Jim Troupis and former Trump aide Mike Roman were in court for the hearing but did not testify. The judge postponed the preliminary hearing for a third person charged, Ken Chesebro, amid questions about what comments he made to prosecutors could be admitted in court.\n\nPence’s group urges Trump to fire RFK Jr.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence’s group Advancing American Freedom on Monday called on Trump to fire Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over what the group argues has been a slow-walked safety review of the chemical abortion drug mifepristone.\n\nKennedy and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary have pledged to review the drug’s safety but are facing mounting pressure from abortion opponents to move more quickly. Mifepristone, which was approved 25 years ago, has repeatedly been deemed safe and effective by FDA scientists.\n\nIn a statement alongside Monday’s memo, the Republican Pence accused Kennedy of being unable or unwilling to keep promises to abortion opponents and said he should step aside.\n\nThe attacks come as Kennedy has faced criticism from both sides but also waves of support as he seeks to dramatically reshape the nation’s health agencies and target vaccines.\n\nTrump again says he’s ended hostilities between Thailand and Cambodia. But fighting continues\n\nThe two countries agreed to a ceasefire in July, and formalized the deal in October when Trump was in Malaysia. But lately, fighting has resumed. Trump on Friday said he had called the leaders and got them to agree to another truce -- but officials said heavy combat continues.\n\nNevertheless, Trump on Monday said in the Oval Office that “we were able to straighten that out.”\n\nThe two countries were “having a little problem yesterday,” Trump said. “I called them and I said, ‘look, fellas, relax. You gotta take it easy.’ They started the war again, and I got it ended.”\n\nTrump says he has asked Xi to free Jimmy Lai\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he feels “so badly” about Jimmy Lai, a former Hong Kong media mogul who on Monday was convicted in a landmark national security case.\n\nLai, 78, now could spend the rest of his life in prison. On Monday, Trump confirmed that he has brought up Lai’s case with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and asked for Lai’s release.\n\n“I spoke to President XI about it, and I asked to consider his release,” Trump said. “He’s not well, he’s an older man, and he’s not well, so I did put that request out. We’ll see what happens.”\n\nIn London and Washington, Jimmy Lai’s children have expressed gratitude for the support from the Trump administration.\n\nPresident Trump praises José Antonio Kast’s win in Chilean presidential election\n\nTrump touted the win by Kast, a far right conversative who comfortably defeated his left-of-center opponent in Sunday’s election, as a sign of his broader influence on politics across the Western Hemisphere.\n\n“I look forward to pay my respects to him here,” Trump said of Kast. “He’s a very good person.”\n\nKast is the most conservative candidate to win Chile’s presidential election in 35 years. He won 58.2% of the votes on a campaign heavily centered on crime and immigration.\n\nTrump defends Syria’s new leader after attack that killed three Americans\n\nTrump said Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa “feels very badly” about an attack over the weekend that claimed the lives of two Iowa National Guard members and a U.S. civilian.\n\nTrump said the attack happened in a region of Syria that the new government doesn’t control.\n\n“This had nothing to do with him,” said Trump, speaking of al-Sharaa. He hosted al-Sharaa at the White House in November.\n\n“He feels very badly about it. He’s working on it. He’s a strong man, and this had nothing to do with the Syrian government,” Trump said.\n\nThe U.S. military and Trump have blamed the attack on the Islamic State group. Trump has threatened to retaliate.\n\nTrump defends FBI and calls Brown shooting a ‘school problem’\n\nTrump defended the FBI after a mass shooting at Brown University, arguing that questions about the case should be directed to officials at the Ivy League school in Rhode Island.\n\nTrump told reporters in the Oval Office that authorities do not yet know a motive in the shooting that killed two and injured others.\n\nPressed about why the FBI has not been able to identify a shooter, Trump called it a “school problem.” Brown “had their own guards, they had their own police and their own everything,” he said.\n\nTrump told reporters to “ask that question, really, to the school, not to the FBI,” which he said “came in after the fact.”\n\nHe said the FBI “will do a good job,” and cited the Charlie Kirk assassination as an example. In that case, the alleged killer’s family helped turn him in to authorities.\n\nTrump says the administration is considering changing how it treats marijuana\n\n“We are considering the idea because a lot of people want to see it,” the president said.\n\nTrump had said in August that he was reviewing whether the federal government should reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug. Such a step could move the federal government closer to an approach already embraced by many states.\n\n“We are looking at that very strongly,” Trump said at the White House.\n\nTrump doubles down on criticizing Reiner and calls him ‘deranged’\n\nThe president was asked if he stood by his social media post in light of the pushback he was getting, including from those in his own party.\n\nUsing the third person, Trump said Reiner “was a deranged person as far as Trump is concerned.”\n\n“I was not a fan of Rob Reiner at all, in any way shape or form,” Trump said. “I thought he was very bad for our country.”\n\nTrump signs executive order classifying fentanyl as a ‘weapon of mass destruction’\n\nHe signed the order in the Oval Office on Monday while flanked by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Dan Caine, White House border czar Tom Homan and other top military officials.\n\nTrump says his administration is “formally classifying fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction, which is what it is. No bomb does what this is doing.”\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the new designation would affect administration policy or what the legal implications would be for those impacted by fentanyl use or drug traffickers.\n\nThe term weapon of mass destruction has typically referred to nuclear, biological, chemical or kinetic threats capable of causing overwhelming and lasting damage to a population, infrastructure or environment. The term has also been hotly debated in American politics since the U.S. invasion of Iraq.\n\nTrump is recognizing 13 military service members with a Mexican Border Defense Medal\n\nThe president is in the Oval Office with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Trump border czar Tom Homan, all of them hailing the border defense portion of his immigration crackdown.\n\nMilitary commanders and the award recipients looked on as Trump, Hegseth and Homan declared the border secure. Trump said his administration has “stopped the invasion in its tracks, and we are dismantling the cartels very rapidly.”\n\nHe added many hits from his 2024 campaign speech, blasting the immigration policies of his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, and declaring migrants who crossed the border “some of the worst people on Earth.”\n\nHoman praised “greatest president of my lifetime – yes, I said it.” Hegseth said the medal is a reprisal of a military honor awarded previously in the early 20th century\n\nTrump expresses optimism that Russia-Ukraine war is nearing the end\n\n“I think we’re closer now than we have been, ever,” Trump said while recapping war talks in Europe at the start of an unrelated White House event.\n\nTrump said he had a “long talk” with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He also spoke with the leaders of several European countries, including Germany, Italy, France and the United Kingdom as well as NATO.\n\n“Things are going along pretty well,” the president said.\n\nTrump said everyone wants to see the war end.\n\nPresident Trump to deliver remarks in North Carolina on Friday\n\nThe president’s upcoming trip to Rocky Mount was confirmed by Republican Senate candidate Michael Whatley, a close Trump ally who was chair of the Republican National Committee during the 2024 election.\n\n“Let’s give him the North Carolina welcome he deserves,” Whatley wrote on social media. Whatley did not describe a reason for the trip in his social media post.\n\nThe event will take place at the Rocky Mount Events Center. Trump last week traveled to Pennsylvania to discuss the economy and cost of living.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson urges an appeal to ‘our better angels’ after weekend violence\n\n“We’re seeing a lot of tragedies,” the GOP speaker said as he arrived at the Capitol.\n\nHe drew on scripture to provide comfort to the Reiner family and others after “the senseless violence” this past weekend in Australia and at Brown University.\n\n“We have to appeal to our better angels,” Johnson said, and “I think we have to amplify those voices.”He declined to answer questions about Trump’s insensitive remarks after Reiner’s death.\n\nUS, Paraguay sign agreement setting out legal basis for American troops in the country\n\nThe United States and Paraguay have signed an agreement laying out the legal framework for American troops to be stationed the in the South American country and clearing the way for further defense and intelligence cooperation between the two as the Trump administration steps up military operations throughout the western hemisphere.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio and Paraguayan Foreign Minister Ruben Ramirez signed the so-called “status of forces” agreement on Monday at the State Department. Both men hailed the deal as a step forward in relations that would enhance already strong counter-terrorism and -narcotics measures.\n\nSuch agreements outline the legal requirements and immunities for U.S. troops to be present in other countries, although there was no immediate announcement of any deployments to Paraguay.\n\nCalifornia hires two former CDC officials who rebuffed Trump, Kennedy\n\nCalifornia is hiring two former top federal health officials, state officials said Monday.\n\nSusan Monarez, the former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is helping California launch an effort to maintain trust in science-driven decision-making and improve public health infrastructure.\n\nMonarez is being joined by Dr. Debra Houry, CDC’s former chief medical officer. Both will be advisors, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced.\n\nThe White House fired Monarez in August when she fell out of favor with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after only one month on the job. Houry and some other top CDC officials resigned in protest.\n\nA few Republicans speak out against Trump post on Reiner\n\nA few Republican members of Congress are calling out President Donald Trump’s insensitive social media post regarding the deaths of director-actor Rob Reiner and his wife Michele.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky tweeted ox X that regardless of how one felt about Reiner, “this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered.”\n\nRep. Mike Lawler of New York said of Trump’s post: “This statement is wrong. Regardless of one’s political views, no one should be subjected to violence, let alone at the hands of their own son. It’s a horrible tragedy that should engender sympathy and compassion from everyone in our country, period.”\n\nAnd Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia tweeted: “This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies. Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It’s incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder.”\n\nNY Attorney General Letitia James makes first comments on the repeated efforts to revive a criminal case against her\n\nJames said Monday she isn’t spending a lot of time thinking about the Trump administration’s repeated efforts to revive a criminal case against her.\n\nJames, a Democrat, made her first public comments about the matter at an unrelated press conference after the news last week that a second federal grand jury had declined to indict her on charges related to her purchase of a home in Norfolk, Virginia, in 2020.\n\n“I don’t really spend a lot of time focused on this campaign of retribution,” said James. “I’ve got a lot of work on my hands — standing up and defending the rights of New Yorkers, protecting them from harms coming from Washington, D.C.”\n\nA judge last month threw out an indictment charging James with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution, ruling that the prosecutor who brought the case at Republican President Donald Trump’s urging was illegally appointed by the Justice Department.\n\n“I’ve got a job to do,” said James, who had pleaded not guilty to the earlier indictment and denies any wrongdoing.\n\nPoll shows health costs are a rising concern among Americans\n\nAbout 3 in 10 Americans cite the cost of health care as the most urgent health problem facing the country, and about one-quarter say the health care system is in “crisis,” according to a new Gallup poll released Monday.\n\nThe poll also shows that only 16% of Americans are satisfied with the cost of health care in the U.S.\n\nThe findings from the survey conducted in November come as Congress has yet to address the spiking health insurance premium costs facing millions of Americans when Affordable Care Act health subsidies expire at the start of the new year.\n\nIt also comes as health expenses have risen across the board in response to a variety of factors, including inflation and the increasing use of expensive medications such as GLP-1 weight loss drugs.\n\nHunter Biden disbarred in Connecticut after complaints about federal convictions\n\nBiden agreed to the penalty and admitted to violating the state’s attorney conduct rules, but he did not admit to committing any crimes.\n\nHis father, former President Joe Biden, pardoned him last year after he was convicted of three felonies relating to a 2018 gun purchase and pleaded guilty to failing to pay federal taxes. He previously was disbarred in Washington, D.C.\n\nA Connecticut judge ordered the disbarment on Monday. Hunter Biden did not speak and he and his lawyer appeared via video at the virtual court hearing in Waterbury.\n\nThe judge found that Hunter Biden violated several lawyer ethics rules, including engaging in conduct “involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.”\n\nIn a court document, Hunter Biden admitted to some but not all of the misconduct allegations. The judge also cited the Washington disbarment. He was admitted to the Connecticut bar in 1997, a year after graduating from Yale Law School.\n\nWhite House views Russian openness to Ukraine joining the EU as a big deal\n\nThe U.S. officials who briefed reporters after Witkoff and Kushner met with Zelenskyy and other European officials in Berlin over the last two days said such an offer over Ukraine joining the EU would be a major concession by Moscow. But Russia has previously said it doesn’t object to Ukraine joining the EU.",

    "description": "The Jeffrey Epstein victims'  lawsuits resembled two others, against JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, which settled for hundreds of millions.",
    "fullText": "A federal judge expressed skepticism about a pair of lawsuits that victims of Jeffrey Epstein had filed against two banks, suggesting he may dismiss them before they have a chance to go to trial.\n\nAt the outset of a Monday afternoon hearing in Manhattan federal court, US District Judge Jed Rakoff unfavorably compared the lawsuits against Bank of America and BNY Mellon to two similar lawsuits he had previously overseen, against JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank. JPMorgan agreed to settle the case for $290 million. Deutsche Bank agreed to settle for $75 million.\n\nRakoff said the language in the lawsuits against Bank of America and BNY Mellon — which were brought by the same attorneys and filed in October — was \"frequently conclusory\" and appeared to lack sufficient detail to demonstrate what the banks did wrong. He called the lawsuits \"a model of high-pitched rhetoric.\"\n\n\"'Knows' without saying by whom is vague. 'Affiliated' without saying what that means is vague,\" Rakoff told David Boies, an attorney who brought the case. \"A lot of that language is in the complaint.\"\n\nAt the end of the hearing, Rakoff gave the lawyers who brought the lawsuits on behalf of Epstein victims — David Boies, Sigrid McCawley, Brad Edwards, and Brittany Henderson — two weeks to revise their cases with more specific details about their allegations.\n\nThe judge said they would be permitted to use material they had already gathered as part of the discovery process in the case, but should put a hold on additional depositions and subpoenas until he issued a ruling, which he said could come at the end of January.\n\nThe lawsuits allege that Bank of America and BNY Mellon aided in Epstein's sex-trafficking operation by providing him with banking services and then ignoring red flags tied to his transactions.\n\nEpstein, a well-connected financier, killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on criminal sex-trafficking charges. One of his associates, Ghislaine Maxwell, is serving a 20-year prison sentence for trafficking girls to him.\n\nMonday's hearing was scheduled for the judge to weigh motions to dismiss the two lawsuits outright.\n\nCharlotte Taylor, an attorney at the law firm Jones Day representing Bank of America, argued the lawsuits consisted of \"recycled boilerplate allegations\" and that they could not prove the bank provided anything other than \"routine banking services\" to Epstein and his associates. Felicia Ellsworth, an attorney at WilmerHale, said the plaintiffs couldn't prove anyone at BNY Mellon had the \"state of mind\" to be found liable.\n\nBoies told Rakoff that the banks should have noticed enough smoke around the transactions from bank accounts belonging to Epstein and his associates to know there was a fire. Aside from Epstein's 2008 criminal conviction in Florida, he had been dogged by civil litigation for years, Boies said.\n\nRakoff expressed skepticism that the pattern of facts alleged in the lawsuit would be enough.\n\n\"Last I checked, that's not enough to survive a motion to dismiss,\" Rakoff said. \"You need to have enough allegations as to specific facts.\"\n\nFollowing the hearing, lawyers for the Epstein victims appeared eager to revise their lawsuits and include the information they obtained through the discovery process. Rakoff said that material may be redacted on the public docket.\n\n\"I think he's giving us a chance,\" Sigrid McCawley, an attorney at Boies Schiller Flexner, told Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has sued the BBC for defamation over a documentary that his lawyers say presents a \"false and defamatory\" portrayal of him.\n\nOn Monday night, Trump's lawyers filed a civil complaint in a federal court in Florida, seeking at least $5 billion in damages from the British broadcaster.\n\nThe 46-page lawsuit claims that the BBC has defamed Trump in a Panorama documentary that aired about a week before the 2024 election, called \"Trump: A Second Chance.\" The complaint alleges the program presented a \"false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction\" of Trump.\n\nThe suit's allegations focus on how the documentary was edited, specifically regarding footage of Trump's January 6, 2021, speech near the White House.\n\n\"President Trump's powerhouse lawsuit is holding the BBC accountable for its defamation and reckless election interference just as he has held other fake news mainstream media responsible for their wrongdoing,\" a spokesperson for Trump's legal team told Business Insider.\n\nThe filing included correspondence that Trump and the BBC's legal team exchanged in November.\n\nTrump's attorney, Alejandro Brito, wrote a letter to the BBC on November 9, demanding that it retract \"false and defamatory statements\" about Trump. Brito threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion if it did not comply.\n\nThe BBC's legal team wrote back on November 13, saying that the BBC had \"no intention of misleading anyone\" and included a copy of the outlet's apology letter to Trump. The correspondence said that Trump did not have a basis for a defamation claim.\n\nIn a separate online statement on the same day, the BBC said the outlet and its chair, Samir Shah, were \"sorry for the edit of the President's speech on 6 January 2021.\"\n\n\"The BBC has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary 'Trump: A Second Chance?' on any BBC platforms,\" the statement said. \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\"\n\nThe BBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis is a developing story; please check back for updates.",
