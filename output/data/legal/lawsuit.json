    "fullText": "If Trevor Noah really wanted a response from Donald Trump on his mocking question of “What are you going to do about it?” during the Grammys on Sunday night, the former Apprentice host just gave it to him, maybe.\n\nAs he has with so many critics, those who poke fun at him and almost anything to do with Jeffrey Epstein, Trump is threatening to take Noah to court.\n\nTrevor Noah Takes Shots At Nicki Minaj, Donald Trump’s Epstein Association & More During Grammys Show\n\nTrump Celebrity Supporters: Famous Folks In Favor Of The 47th President\n\nAlex Warren Shares What He Heard During Grammy Audio Glitch: \"This Would Only Happen To Me\"\n\n“It looks like I’ll be sending my lawyers to sue this poor, pathetic, talentless, dope of an M.C., and suing him for plenty,” the notoriously thin-skinned Trump posted online Sunday, not long after the Kendrick Lamar and Bad Bunny dominated the 68th annual Grammy Awards on CBS. “Ask Little George Slopadopolus, and others, how that all worked out. Also ask CBS! Get ready Noah, I’m going to have some fun with you!”\n\nProving that he loves to watch and loves to remind everyone who has already kissed the ring and written the checks, POTUS’ long, enraged and uppercase-strewn post on his Truth Social platform denounced the music industry’s big night and Noah’s last turn as Grammy host. No surprise, it was all because of a bipartisan crack by the ex-Daily Show host about that past presidential pal and deceased pedophile Epstein — as you can see here:\n\nTrevor Noah takes another jab at Donald Trump #Grammys: “Song of the Year — that is a Grammy that every artist wants almost as much as Trump wants Greenland, which makes sense because Epstein’s island is gone, he needs a new one to hang out with Bill Clinton” pic.twitter.com/quUWEpX4NL\n\n— Deadline (@DEADLINE) February 2, 2026\n\nGenerating a roar from the music crowd over his swipe at Trump, Noah’s quip of “what are you going to do about it?” was born out of the reality that 2026 is going to be his final time hosting the Grammys after several years fronting the shindig.\n\nTrump didn’t give a toss about any of that.\n\n“Noah said, INCORRECTLY about me, that Donald Trump and Bill Clinton spent time on Epstein Island,” Trump digitally raged. “WRONG!!! I can’t speak for Bill, but I have never been to Epstein Island, nor anywhere close, and until tonight’s false and defamatory statement, have never been accused being there, not even by the Fake News Media.”\n\nThe remarks by Noah and the reaction by Trump comes just a couple of days after the MAGA Overlord’s Department of Justice dumped millions of redacted pages and hundreds of thousands of black-barred images from the long-delayed and much-anticipated Epstein Files. Still, with speculation that there is much more not out there despite congressional demands, Trump’s name comes up various times in what was released on January 30, including some pretty horrific allegations and new details. Among those also mentioned are L.A. Olympics boss Casey Wasserman, Elon Musk, ex-POTUS Clinton, Melania docu director Brett Ratner, Bill Gates (and some “Russian girl”), Jay-Z, the now-former Prince Andrew of Windsor, Harvey Weinstein, and of course Epstein’s right-hand lady and current federal convict Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nWhile admitting he knew Epstein back in the roaring ’80s and ’90s, Trump always has denied he got up to anything inappropriate with or via him. As accusations against the one-time openly philandering Trump have been made by alleged Epstein victims and others (as well as cringy video of Trump and Epstein and correspondence between the two), little has made it to the courts connecting him to the horrors of sex trafficking and more.\n\nSuspicion of how deep Trump really went with Epstein, who died in 2019 by what was termed suicide in police custody has become a benchmark for Democrats and others – even when the likes of Clinton and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers have also been caught in the ugly web. The massive files release of January 30 even found Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche having to insist more than once the DOJ wasn’t and hadn’t been covering up for POTUS — to almost no avail.\n\nHaving started on CBS when Trump hero Richard Nixon was in the White House in 1973, tonight was the last time the Grammys will be seen on the now David Ellison-owned network.\n\nStarting in 2027, the ceremony will be broadcast on ABC as part of the Grammys’ 10-year deal with Disney, which was announced last year. As the Oscars leave ABC for YouTube in 2029, the Grammys will air on ABC, Hulu and Disney+ from next year all the way to 2036 – when a then 90-year-old Trump will almost certainly not be president, maybe.\n\n2026 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Streaming & Cable\n\n2026 Awards Season Calendar: Dates For Oscars, Guilds, Tonys & More\n\nThe 25 Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Global Box Office",

    "description": "(Corrects by removing former paragraphs 22-23 with incorrect reference to criminal defendent Abdikadir Noor being plaintiff in civil lawsuit) By Brad Brooks and Joseph Ax MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 28 (Reuters)",
    "fullText": "(Corrects by removing former paragraphs 22-23 with incorrect reference to criminal defendent Abdikadir Noor being plaintiff in civil lawsuit)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump warned Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Wednesday he was \"playing with fire\" for insisting that local police would refrain from enforcing federal immigration laws, a day after the president said he intended to \"de-escalate a ​little bit\" in the city.\n\nAmid the mixed signals from the White House, tensions remained high in Minneapolis, where observers and activists said deportation raids carried out by Trump's \"Operation Metro Surge\" had not slackened but ‌seemed more targeted on Wednesday.\n\nThe city has been convulsed by running confrontations between protesters and heavily armed immigration agents, with unrest heightened after two U.S. citizens were shot dead by federal officers - Renee Good on January 7 and Alex Pretti on Saturday.\n\nDemonstrations have spread to cities large and ‌small across the country in recent weeks, with Minneapolis finding its way into the pop culture on Wednesday as singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen released a protest song honoring Pretti and Good.\n\nIn one sign of how immigration agents might be changing their tactics, an internal memo reviewed by Reuters directed officers to avoid unnecessary communication and engagement with protesters.\n\nA day after striking a conciliatory tone in their public comments following weeks of heated rhetoric, Trump and other top administration officials were talking tough again on Wednesday.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said on social that federal agents had arrested 16 people on Wednesday in Minnesota for allegedly assaulting, resisting or impeding federal law enforcement.\n\n\"Nothing will stop us from continuing to make arrests and enforce the law,\" Bondi ⁠wrote.\n\nA federal judge in Minneapolis said on Wednesday that it was the U.S. ‌Immigration and Customs Enforcement that was flouting the law by ignoring dozens of federal court orders during the immigration enforcement surge this month.\n\nWhile canceling a contempt-of-court hearing for acting ICE chief Todd Lyons, after the agency belatedly complied with an order to release a wrongly detained Ecuadorean man, U.S. District Judge Patrick Schlitz listed at least 96 court orders he said ‍ICE has violated in 74 cases.\n\n\"This list should give pause to anyone - no matter his or her political beliefs - who cares about the rule of law,\" Schlitz wrote. \"ICE has likely violated more court orders in January 2025 than some federal agencies have violated in their entire existence.\"\n\nAt the same time, the two immigration officers who opened fire on Pretti have been placed on administrative leave, according to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, adding that it was \"standard protocol.\"\n\nTrump's administration had indicated on Tuesday ​it would soften its approach, dispatching border czar Tom Homan to take over the operation from Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol official whose aggressive tactics drew widespread criticism and legal challenges.\n\nA senior administration official said Homan's arrival ‌would mark a shift to more traditional, narrowly aimed operations rather than the broad street sweeps Bovino had led in multiple cities.\n\nThat change appeared codified in a newly issued internal ICE directive instructing agents to avoid engaging with \"agitators\" while on duty, warning that an antagonistic posture \"serves no purpose other than inflaming the situation.\"\n\nThe guidance, reviewed by Reuters, also orders ICE officers only to go after immigrants who have criminal charges or convictions, a departure from earlier tactics that had included randomly questioning individuals on the street about their immigration status.\n\nObservers and activists told Reuters that ICE activity appeared to slow somewhat on Tuesday before resuming in full on Wednesday, though in a more targeted manner than before.\n\nOn Wednesday, ICE agents were seen in several parts of the city rolling up to homes and businesses in caravans of three vehicles with six to eight agents in total, then knocking on doors and looking around, seemingly for a specific ⁠person.\n\nIf that person were not found, observers said, the agents were seen leaving. In past weeks, agents might have begun approaching people ​and demanding documented proof of legal status.\n\nUnder mounting political pressure, Trump had dialed back his rhetorical attacks on Frey and Governor ​Tim Walz after speaking with both Democrats in the wake of Pretti's killing, vowing to work with them to ease friction.\n\nBut on social media on Wednesday, Trump faulted Frey for reiterating the position of local leaders that the city would not enforce immigration laws. Trump wrote: \"Could somebody in his inner sanctum please explain that this statement is a very serious violation of the ‍Law, and that he is PLAYING WITH FIRE!\"\n\nTrump has threatened ⁠to cut off funding for states that include so-called sanctuary jurisdictions, which limit how much cooperation they give federal immigration authorities.\n\nIn response, Frey wrote on social media, \"The job of our police is to keep people safe, not enforce fed immigration laws.\"\n\nPretti, 37, an intensive care nurse, was shot dead during protests near his home on Saturday, and some administration officials immediately accused him of planning to kill officers, citing the handgun ⁠he was carrying.\n\nBut video verified by Reuters showed Pretti held only a phone in his hand when Border Patrol agents pushed him to the ground. Video also showed that an agent found Pretti's gun near his waist and removed it seconds before another agent shot a ‌restrained Pretti in the back.",

    "description": "Tennessee quarterback Joey Aguilar separated from Diego Pavia's lawsuit vs NCAA. Here's why Aguilar's eligibility battle could be waged in Knoxville.",
    "fullText": "Tennessee quarterback Joey Aguilar, after hiring a high-powered attorney, has separated from the Diego Pavia federal lawsuit challenging the NCAA's eligibility rules regarding former junior college players.\n\nIt appears 24-year-old Aguilar will go it alone in his attempt to play for the Vols in the 2026 season. However, there could be more to his strategy than meets the eye.\n\nOn Jan. 30, the court granted Aguilar's voluntary dismissal from the Pavia case, according to court records obtained by Knox News. Pavia, the former Vanderbilt quarterback, filed the antitrust lawsuit against the NCAA in late 2024, and Aguilar joined as a plaintiff in November 2025.\n\nOn Jan. 28, Aguilar informed the court that he had retained attorney Cam Norris to represent him.\n\nNotably, in 2024, Norris defeated the NCAA in court regarding its probe into UT and former quarterback Nico Iamaleava. Now he'll try help Aguilar, another Vols quarterback.\n\nNorris did not respond to a Knox News request for comment.\n\nAguilar's legal strategy isn't known. But some recent eligibility lawsuits filed in state court against the NCAA could serve as a template.\n\nOn Jan. 21, the Tuscaloosa Circuit Court in Alabama granted 23-year-old NBA G League player Charles Bediako a temporary restraining order to return to college basketball. He is now an active player for University of Alabama.\n\nTrinidad Chambliss, the 23-year-old Ole Miss quarterback, filed his eligibility lawsuit against the NCAA in Calhoun County Circuit Court in Mississippi. Chambliss is seeking to prove that he should be granted a medical hardship waiver for his 2022 season at Ferris State.\n\nChambliss' motion for a preliminary injunction will be heard Feb. 12. If successful, he would be eligible to play college football in the 2026 season.\n\nAguilar's legal argument is quite different from Bediako and Chambliss. But Aguilar likely stands a better chance of victory in a Tennessee state court than federal, and he could still benefit from the Pavia case.\n\nAguilar could file a lawsuit in Tennessee state court, presumably in Knox County, in hopes of obtaining a temporary retraining order against NCAA rules that deem Aguilar ineligible. If successful, that could lead to a preliminary injunction hearing as a long-term solution for Aguilar.\n\nIf Aguilar's attorney opts for that strategy, the process could take only a few weeks.\n\nTennessee starts spring practice in mid-March, although the opening date hasn't been announced. Aguilar is expected to be in recovery through late February, following a Jan. 2 surgery to remove a benign tumor on his arm, NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported.\n\nAguilar is not currently enrolled. However, UT offers a mini-session, giving students the option to cram a course into a condensed time frame during a half-semester. That session runs from March 18 to May 7.\n\nIf Aguilar remains ineligible, redshirt freshman George MacIntyre, five-star freshman Faizon Brandon and Colorado transfer Ryan Staub will compete for the starting job in the 2026 season.\n\nAguilar led the SEC with 3,565 passing yards, the third most in a single season in UT history, along with 24 TD passes in 2025. If he returned in 2026, he'd presumably remain the Vols' starter.\n\nThe Pavia federal case is at a critical juncture. Aguilar is no longer a plaintiff, but the ruling could impact his eligibility.\n\nA hearing is scheduled for Feb. 10 in Nashville, where Judge William Campbell will consider a preliminary injunction halting NCAA rules regarding former junior college players.\n\nOn Jan. 15, Campbell denied a request for a preliminary injunction in a similar case, where college football players sought to play a fifth season. They were challenging the NCAA redshirt rule, which allows an athlete to compete in four seasons over five years.\n\nPavia, who initially filed the lawsuit regarding junior college players, will not return to college next season, even if his case is successful. He has declared for the 2026 NFL Draft. However, 25 additional players remain as plaintiffs.\n\nIf the Pavia case fails, Aguilar would not be bound by its ruling. Therefore, he could still be successful in state court.\n\nIf the Pavia case succeeds, Aguilar would not gain eligibility immediately because he's no longer a plaintiff. However, language of a preliminary injunction presumably would be broad enough for Pavia to file a federal action in the same court that would have the effect of a class action suit, applying to former junior college players with the same fact pattern as Pavia. That would include Aguilar.\n\nThe NCAA allows players to compete for four seasons within five years. And it counts junior college seasons toward that total and time period even though junior colleges are not part of the NCAA.\n\nPavia's lawsuit seeks to change the eligibility rules, where junior college competition wouldn’t factor into NCAA seasons of eligibility or an athlete’s eligibility clock. Only seasons at an NCAA institution would count as part of NCAA eligibility.\n\nThat means Aguilar, who started his career in junior college, would get one more season to play. He already has spent seven years in college football, but only three seasons at NCAA member schools.\n\nIn 2019, Aguilar redshirted at City College of San Francisco. In 2020, the COVID pandemic canceled his junior college season there. In 2021-22, he played two junior college seasons at Diablo Valley College in Pleasant Hill, California.\n\nHis NCAA career began in 2023 when he played at Appalachian State. He transferred to UCLA for spring 2025, and then he transferred to Tennessee in essentially a quarterback swap involving Iamaleava.\n\nAguilar retained Norris, a high-powered attorney who previously defeated the NCAA in court.\n\nIn 2024, Norris successfully argued on behalf of the Tennessee attorney general’s office in UT's defense against an NCAA probe over NIL rules. In that case, the state of Tennessee argued the NCAA rules regarding NIL benefits violated antitrust laws.\n\nThat lawsuit was filed on the heels of the NCAA's investigation into UT's NIL dealings, especially those involving its recruitment of quarterback Iamaleava. The federal lawsuit and the NCAA’s investigation into UT weren't directly connected, but the prior impacted the latter.\n\nNorris' argument was effective. A federal judge suspended NCAA rules regarding NIL benefits for athlete. And the case was settled in January 2025, allowing college athletes to negotiate NIL deals during the recruiting process without fear of NCAA penalties.\n\nMeanwhile, the NCAA dropped into investigation into UT and Iamaleava.\n\nNorris practices law for the Consovoy McCarthy firm in Arlington, Virginia, but he lives in Knoxville. He graduated from Vanderbilt Law School.\n\nNorris has represented prominent nonprofits, many states in federal court, the Republican Party and then-candidate Donald Trump in 2022. He has argued twice at the U.S. Supreme Court, including the landmark case Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard.\n\nAdam Sparks is the Tennessee football beat reporter.

    "description": "Lindsey Graham ended his blockade Friday preventing the Senate from passing the House funding package, but not before putting House Speaker Johnson on notice.",
    "fullText": "Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) ended his blockade that had prevented the Senate from passing the House funding package, but not before putting House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) on notice for crossing him on certain provisions.\n\nGraham also took a raincheck for a vote related to former Special Counsel Jack Smith’s Arctic Frost investigation, which obtained phone records of some senators who were assisting President Donald Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nJohnson stripped the House funding package of a provision that would allow those lawmakers, including Graham, to sue over the data collection. Graham had indicated he intended to seek $500,000 in damages from the federal government.\n\n“I’m not going to give up on the idea that we should abandon holding Jack Smith accountable,” Graham said on the Senate floor. “The House, you took the Arctic Frost language of the Senate and took it all out. You could have called me about the $500,000. I would be glad to work with you. You jammed me, Speaker Johnson! I won’t forget this.”\n\nYou took the provision and you gutted it. You took the notification provision out telling senators or congressmen they’re asking for your phone records when you’re not under criminal investigation, and you should know…It’s Republicans today, could be Democrats tomorrow. We should all want to be notified as senators if a separate branch of government, the Executive Branch, is looking for our phone records unless we’re charged or investigating a crime. That’s just common sense. They took that out.\n\nThere was a stampede in the House. Everybody says, “Well, it passed unanimously in the House.” I could care less! What you did, I think was wrong. You’re overreacting. We’ll fix the $500,000. Count me in. But you took the notification out, and I’m not going to give up on that.\n\nGraham added, “I’m demanding a vote on the floor of the United States Senate, an amendment that requires notification to a member of Congress if their phone records are being looked at by the Executive Branch unless they are under criminal investigation.”\n\nA short partial government shutdown is still expected since time is running out before Friday’s midnight deadline, and the House will need to reconsider the legislation.\n\nWatch the clip above via C-SPAN.\n\nThe post ’Speaker Johnson, I Won’t Forget This’: Lindsey Graham Threatens Top Republican for Thwarting Lawsuit first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "A lawsuit filed last week alleges tech firm ‘can access virtually all’ private communications, a claim the company has denied\n\nUS authorities have reportedly investigated claims that Meta can read users’ encrypted chats on the WhatsApp messaging platform, which it owns.\n\nThe reports follow a lawsuit filed last week, which claimed Meta “can access virtually all of WhatsApp users’ purportedly ‘private’ communications”.\n\nMeta has denied the allegation, reported by Bloomberg, calling the lawsuit’s claim “categorically false and absurd”. It suggested the claim was a tactic to support the NSO Group, an Israeli firm that develops spyware used against activists and journalists, and which recently lost a lawsuit brought by WhatsApp.\n\nThe firm that filed last week’s lawsuit against Meta, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, attributes the allegation to unnamed “courageous” whistleblowers from Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico and South Africa.\n\nQuinn Emanuel is, in a separate case, helping to represent the NSO Group in its appeal against a judgment from a US federal court last year, which ordered it to pay $167m to WhatsApp for violating its terms of service in its deployment of Pegasus spyware against more than 1,400 users.\n\n“We’re pursuing sanctions against Quinn Emanuel for filing a meritless lawsuit that was designed purely to grab headlines,” said Carl Woog, a Meta spokesperson, in a statement. “This is the same firm that is trying to help NSO overturn an injunction that barred their operations for targeting journalists and government officials with spyware.”\n\nAdam Wolfson, a partner at Quinn Emanuel said: “Our colleagues’ defence of NSO on appeal has nothing to do with the facts disclosed to us and which form the basis of the lawsuit we brought for worldwide WhatsApp users.\n\n“We look forward to moving forward with those claims and note WhatsApp’s denials have all been carefully worded in a way that stops short of denying the central allegation in the complaint – that Meta has the ability to read WhatsApp messages, regardless of its claims about end-to-end encryption.”\n\nSteven Murdoch, professor of security engineering at UCL, said the lawsuit was “a bit strange”. “It seems to be going mostly on whistleblowers, and we don’t know much about them or their credibility,” he said. “I would be very surprised if what they are claiming is actually true.”\n\nIf WhatsApp were, indeed, reading users’ messages, this was likely to have been discovered by staff and would end the business, he said. “It’s very hard to keep secrets inside a company. If there was something as scandalous as this going on, I think it’s very likely that it would have leaked out from someone within WhatsApp.”\n\nThe Bloomberg article cites reports and interviews from officials within the US Department of Commerce in claiming that the US has investigated whether Meta could read WhatsApp messages. However, a spokesperson for the department called these assertions “unsubstantiated”.\n\nWhatsApp bills itself as an end-to-end encrypted platform, which means that messages can be read only by their sender and recipient, and are not decoded by a server in the middle.\n\nThis contrasts with some other messaging apps, such as Telegram, which encrypt messages between a sender and its own servers, preventing third parties from reading the messages, but allowing them – in theory – to be decoded and read by Telegram itself.\n\nA senior executive in the technology sector told the Guardian that WhatsApp’s vaunted privacy “leaves much to be desired”, given the platform’s willingness to collect metadata on its users, such as their profile information, their contact lists, and who they speak to and when.\n\nHowever, the “idea that WhatsApp can selectively and retroactively access the content of [end-to-end encrypted] individual chats is a mathematical impossibility”, he said.\n\nWoog, of Meta, said: “We’re pursuing sanctions against Quinn Emanuel for filing a meritless lawsuit that was designed purely to grab headlines. WhatsApp’s encryption remains secure and we’ll continue to stand up against those trying to deny people’s right to private communication.”",

    "fullText": "Hundreds of parents, teens and school districts have claimed social media is intentionally addictive and harmful\n\nSocial media companies will have to answer to a jury – for the first time – for allegations that their products are intentionally addictive and harmful to young users’ mental health. Hundreds of parents, teens and school districts sued Meta, Snap, TikTok and YouTube, leading to a series of landmark trials that began this week. Jury selection in the first case started on Tuesday in Los Angeles court.\n\nMeta’s Mark Zuckerberg is among the big tech CEOs who are expected to testify. Both sides are likely to bring in experts to hash out the science behind alleged addiction to social media.\n\nThe initial trial involves a 20-year-old, identified by the initials KGM, who alleges she experienced physical and emotional harm after becoming addicted to social media at age 10. This case is expected to last six to eight weeks, and will be the first of about 22 “bellwether” trials. The outcome can signal, and influence, how courts and juries may handle similar lawsuits in the future. Snap and TikTok have settled with the plaintiff in the first case, leaving Meta and YouTube to stand trial.\n\n“Everybody’s looking at it as a data point,” said Benjamin Zipursky, a law professor at Fordham University.\n\nThe legal proceedings follow years of heated criticism of tech companies from angry parents; they blame social networks for causing eating disorders, suicidal thoughts and anxiety in their children. The companies lay blame on the victims, plaintiffs’ lawyers and supporters say: “The tech companies blame parents for not being good parents,” said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project, which has been involved in advocacy work for the plaintiffs. “Their experience has shown that you can be the best parent in the world – you can have conversations, you can limit screen time, you can turn on the bullshit parental controls – and your kid still dies.”\n\nThe cases and future settlements could eventually change the way social media platforms work; plaintiffs are asking for money, as well as injunctive relief that would establish industry-wide safety standards. Legislators around the world are watching; many are trying to impose liability on tech companies in a similar way as the plaintiffs. So even if juries declare the defendants aren’t liable in these cases, lawmakers will be taking notes–and adapting their own strategies, says Eric Goldman, a professor at the Santa Clara University school of law. Some have already enacted laws that align with the plaintiff’s claims.\n\nThere’s more at stake now, legal experts say. “Bad press about how some members of Congress embarrass Zuckerberg is one thing,” Zipursky added. Changing the architecture of a social network may be another entirely.\n\nPlaintiffs want to know: how much did tech companies know about the alleged harm caused by their products, and to what extent did they fail to warn users? They take particular issue with design features such as infinite scroll, autoplay and content curated by algorithms, accusing social media companies of prioritising engagement over wellbeing. Their legal strategy has brought up comparisons with those used against tobacco companies in the 1990s.\n\nThe trial will explore what social media addiction consists of. Tech companies have questioned the scientific link between their platforms and addiction. They also highlight various safety features and parental controls they adopted in recent years. Even if this harm exists, they argue, it’s a result of problematic content, as opposed to a poorly designed system. In doing so, the companies have often relied on a federal law that shields them from liability for third-party content on their platforms: section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. That defense hasn’t worked so far in this case, given the plaintiffs’ novel argument.\n\n“[Plaintiffs] have reconfigured it to say, look: the wrongful thing Meta is doing is running its whole platform in such a way that people get addicted,” Zipursky said. A key issue will be whether plaintiffs can prove the tech companies were wrongfully taking harmful risks, Zipursky added. Moreover, if the plaintiffs can prove that tech companies knowingly and intentionally caused harm, it will be easier to get punitive damages.\n\nSocial media addiction is not included in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the authoritative handbook for mental health treatment. Scientists have, however, catalogued compulsive use with severe consequences among young people, and legislators across the world are engaged in heated debate over its addictive potential and how to respond.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan and Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri are expected to testify in the initial trial. Snap and TikTok reached a settlement in that case but are still defendants in other suits in the state-level trial.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said in an emailed comment that they strongly disagree with these allegations, and stressed that they have listened to parents and worked with experts and law enforcement to address safety issues. The company also cited the introduction of teen accounts, with additional protections.\n\nGoogle spokesperson José Castañeda called allegations in the lawsuits “simply not true”, and emphasized that the company had prioritized providing a safe and healthy experience for young people. Snap commented only on the first bellwether trial, saying they were “pleased to have been able to resolve this matter in an amicable manner”. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhile much of the cases is yet to play out, some unsealed evidence has already drawn criticism of tech companies. That includes allegations that an Instagram employee compared the app to a drug, and that another suggested: “lol, we’re basically pushers.” A Meta spokesperson previously told Politico that the plaintiffs’ allegations relied on “cherry-picked quotes and misinformed opinions in an attempt to present a deliberately misleading picture”.\n\nThe 20-year-old at the center of the initial trial started using social media around age 10, even as her mother tried to stop her from using the apps. She “developed a compulsion to engage with those products nonstop” as a result of their “addictive design” and “constant notifications”, the complaint notes, according to NPR.\n\nLegal experts expect all of these cases will eventually be appealed if they don’t reach a settlement, and there’s no certainty about outcomes until appellate courts have weighed in. They expect tech companies to raise several issues, including whether the Communications Decency Act or first amendment applies, as well as potential disputes over causation and expert testimony. “None of these companies are going to feel that they need to change what they do,” Zipursky said.\n\nStill, juries’ verdicts in the early cases can affect how much companies may pay out. “The jury might signal they’re completely persuaded by the plaintiff’s arguments,” Goldman said. “Then, if there’s any settlement, the price tag will go up substantially.”",

    "description": "Here are the latest details in the legal dispute.",
    "fullText": "Nearly nine months after a country music legend's son and daughter-in-law were slapped with a lawsuit over squirmy construction payout claims, the San Antonio-based builder and George Strait Jr. and his wife, Tamara, struck a closed-door deal to get the matter out of court. Though, both parties are sitting silent on the terms of the resolution.\n\nOn May 5, Build Modern – a San Antonio firm responsible for several modern builds around the center of San Antonio – the junior Strait and wife to task in Kendall County district court. Build Modern Owner David Robertson accused to couple of more than $100,000 in damages when he said they refused to pay for services, ending their contract with a negative balance due to delays he says they caused.\n\nNow, the local builder is withdrawing his suit after months of private remediation efforts.\n\n\"[Build Modern] and all defendants have resolved all claims between them at this time, [Build Modern] no longer wishes to pursue his claims against all defendants, Tamara Strait, George Strait Jr., and Heritage Oaks Trust, through its trustee, Kalyn Carroll,\" Robertson's order to withdrawal his lawsuit reads, filed in Kendall County north of San Antonio in early January.\n\nA judge signed the order two days after filing on January 8. MySA spoke with a representative for both parties, and both declined to comment on the case resolution. So, details behind the deal struck between the two remains a mystery.\n\nHowever, previous court filings show Build Modern was seeking at least the $57,000 it claims is for unpaid construction services and $67,662 left in the contractual balance, totaling $124,662. Robertson also wanted the Straits and the trust to pay for costs accrued in the lawsuit and exemplary damages in an amount determined by a jury.\n\nIt was at the behest of George (\"Bubba\") and Tamara Strait that the case went to a private arbitration. The couple and their attorneys pointed to a common clause in the remodel project – one which was penned between Build Modern and the couple to remodel their Texas Hill Country home – which requires some form of mediation or arbitration effort prior to filing a lawsuit.\n\nThat arbitration order was signed by a judge on June 3, meaning private negotiations over settling the dispute lasted about seven months.\n\nAccording to court documents filed before a judge ordered private remediation, the renovation project was to cost $221,225, and was expected to wrap up by November 1 of 2024. However, the company said Tamara Strait made several decisions that delayed the completion, including ordering backordered cabinets that weren't slated for delivery until December, reneging on a flooring with delayed delivery after it was already partially installed and hiring her own subcontractors that were supposed to be included in the contract with Build Modern.\n\n\"Tamara Strait engaged in a series of actions which resulted in economic damage to [Build Modern] and made it impossible for [the company] to complete the project in a timely manner,\" the firm asserts. \"Most importantly, she repeatedly delayed making payment when payment requests were presented to her.\"\n\nAfter allegedly failing to make several scheduled payments, reportedly hiring subcontractors out from under Build Modern and delaying the process, the lawsuit accuses the Straits of colluding with Heritage Oaks Trust to end the contract in December because the project exceeded the November 1 deadline. Build Modern says Tamara Strait was \"fully aware\" of the updated project timeline and why it had to be pushed back.\n\nThis article originally published at George Strait's son, daughter-in-law quietly settle lawsuit after mediation.",

Specifically, the Red Sox would advertise illusorily low prices for their tickets,” the lawsuit filed against the Fenway Sports Group states. “When purchasers attempted to buy those tickets, however, the Red Sox would add mandatory fees at the last minute, such as “Per-Ticket Fees” and “Order Fees,” that could increase the cost of a purchase by as much as 150%.\"\n\n“In other words, the Red Sox’s advertised tickets were not actually available for purchase at the advertised prices,” the suit continues. “The Red Sox’s use of drip pricing and junk fees was both unfair and deceptive.

    "description": "Jeffrey Epstein's victims have accused Bank of America of facilitating Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking operation.",
    "fullText": "Sex trafficking victims of Jeffrey Epstein scored a mixed victory in court on Thursday after a federal judge tossed one of their lawsuits against a bank — but greenlit part of another case against a different bank.\n\nUS District Judge Jed Rakoff allowed portions of a proposed class-action lawsuit filed by victims against Bank of America to move forward, but dismissed other parts of the case.\n\nRakoff dismissed the entirety of a similar lawsuit the victims had filed against another bank, BNY.\n\nThe Epstein victims had accused Bank of America of ignoring red flags for Epstein's sex-trafficking operation. Their lawsuit said the bank facilitated millions of dollars — including over $170 million from former Apollo CEO Leon Black, who said he paid Epstein for tax advice — into Epstein's accounts. They said the funds were used in part to pay hush money to victims.\n\nRakoff dismissed the parts of the lawsuit that alleged the bank \"knowingly participated\" in Epstein's sex-trafficking operation, as well as allegations that it failed to follow know-your-customer laws in monitoring Epstein's accounts.\n\nBut the judge allowed the victims' claims that Bank of America was a \"knowing beneficiary\" of the sex-trafficking operation to move forward.\n\nThe judge tossed an entire lawsuit that the same lawyers filed against BNY, also known as Bank of New York Mellon Corp. The lawsuit had alleged BNY ignored red flags while processing Epstein's wire transfers and by extending credit to a modeling agency financed by Epstein and owned by Jean-Luc Brunel, who died in his prison cell in 2022 while awaiting trial in France for rape charges.\n\nDavid Boies, an attorney representing the Epstein victims, said he would appeal the dismissal of the BNY lawsuit.\n\n\"We are pleased that the Court sustained our sex trafficking claims against Bank of America, and we look forward to trying that case in May,\" Boies said in a statement. \"We respectively disagree with the Court's dismissal of the complaint against Bank of New York Mellon and we will seek appellate review.\"\n\nRakoff had expressed skepticism about the strength of both lawsuits during a December hearing in his lower Manhattan courtroom. He called them both \"a model of high-pitched rhetoric\" and compared them unfavorably to earlier lawsuits the same attorneys had brought on behalf of Epstein victims against JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, which settled for $290 million and $75 million, respectively.\n\nAt the end of the December hearing, Rakoff gave the lawyers two weeks to file amended versions of their lawsuits with more detail.\n\nThe revisions appeared not to satisfy Rakoff. He dismissed the counts \"with prejudice\" — meaning the lawyers won't get another chance to amend their lawsuits — and said he would issue an opinion explaining his reasoning by February 13.\n\n\"We are pleased with the court's decision dismissing the lawsuit in its entirety, which reinforces that BNY had no involvement in Epstein's crimes,\" BNY spokesperson Ryan Wells told Business Insider. \"BNY has great sympathy for the victims of Jeffrey Epstein and believes his crimes should be fully investigated and prosecuted.\"\n\nIn court, Bank of America lawyers said it offered nothing more than \"routine banking services\" for Epstein. Bill Haldin, a spokesperson for the bank, said it looked forward to \"a full review of the facts\" as the case moved forward.\n\n\"We are pleased the court dismissed most of the claims,\" Haldin said. \"On the remaining claims, it's important to understand the underlying facts have not been reviewed at this stage of the litigation.\"\n\nRakoff had previously put the lawsuits on a fast track, setting deadlines for summary judgment for the spring, which will give Bank of America another chance to have the case dismissed. A trial is scheduled for May.\n\nThe litigation is playing out in the same courthouse where victims have pressed judges to force the Department of Justice to publish its internal files related to Epstein, the well-connected pedophile who killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex-trafficking charges.\n\nThe Justice Department has blown past a December 19 deadline required by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed in November, to release all of its files. Victims and members of Congress have asked judges to appoint an independent monitor to oversee the release of the files. Judges have said they don't have the power to make such an appointment.\n\nIn a court filing Tuesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said the department had reviewed \"millions of pages of materials, applying redactions as appropriate\" and would publish them \"in the near term.\"",

    "description": "The father of Ellieana Peyton has sued Nationwide Children's Hospital. The 27-day-old died after falling from a bed at the hospital in March 2025, the lawsuit says.",
    "fullText": "This story has been updated to include a comment from Nationwide Children's Hospital.\n\nA Muskingum County father alleges in a lawsuit that his 27-day-old daughter died in March 2025 after she was pulled from her unsecured crib at Nationwide Children's Hospital by attached wires, resulting in a fatal fall.\n\nTyler Peyton, of Zanesville, filed the lawsuit against the Columbus-based hospital on Jan. 27 in Franklin County Common Pleas Court on behalf of the estate of Ellieana Peyton.\n\nNationwide Children's Hospital said it could not comment on pending litigation. No other defendants are named in the lawsuit.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Ellieana's mother, Mackenzie Marshall, gave birth to the girl on March 4. Shortly after the birth, Ellieana was diagnosed with a heart condition that can cause difficulty in the heart's ability to create effective cardio output.\n\nThe lawsuit says Ellieana was admitted to Nationwide Children's Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit for monitoring on the same day as her birth. For several weeks, hospital staff monitored Ellieana, the lawsuit says, who was determined to be stable and scheduled to be released to go home on March 28.\n\nAround 9:30 p.m. on March 25, the lawsuit says a patient care assistant left a rail down on Ellieana's crib. Ellieana had cords attached to her for monitoring, and those cords were also connected to a box in the assistant's pocket, court records say.\n\nThe assistant moved away from Ellieana's crib and the lawsuit says the wires pulled Ellieana over the open side of the crib. Ellieana fell approximately three to four feet to the floor, according to the lawsuit.\n\nA CT scan performed the same night showed Ellieana had a skull fracture and brain bleeding, as well as swelling, tenderness and visible bruising, court records say.\n\nEllieana's vital signs and health deteriorated over the course of several days, the lawsuit says, including developing hypotension, decreased oxygen saturation and a rapid heartbeat.\n\nOn the day she had originally been scheduled to go home, Ellieana suffered an acute cardiopulmonary collapse, the lawsuit says. She underwent prolonged CPR, as well as being intubated. Testing showed she had severe brain injuries caused in part by a lack of oxygen reaching her brain, according to the lawsuit.\n\nOn March 30, another CT scan showed extensive hypoxic-ischemic injuries throughout Ellieana's brain, injuries caused by reduced oxygen and blood flow to the brain, the lawsuit says. Her condition was determined by doctors to be irreversible.\n\nEllieana died at 7:50 p.m. on March 31 at 27 days old.\n\nAn autopsy performed by the Franklin County Coroner's office said Ellieana died from her congenital heart defect, which was complicated by the effects of the head injury she suffered in the fall. Her death was ruled an accident, according to the autopsy.\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking damages for medical negligence, wrongful death and misconduct.\n\nReporter Bethany Bruner can be reached at bbruner@dispatch.com.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Columbus Dispatch: Father of baby who fatally fell from crib sues Nationwide Children's",

    "description": "The settlement means TikTok will avoid a trial where plaintiffs had planned to argue that social media platforms are inherently defective and subject to personal injury liability.",
    "fullText": "TikTok reached an agreement late Monday to settle a lawsuit over claims that social media companies had engineered their products to hook young users, avoiding the first in a series of landmark trials.\n\nThe trial, which is scheduled to begin in the California Superior Court of Los Angeles County with jury selection on Tuesday, is the first in a series of lawsuits expected to be heard this year against Meta, YouTube, Snap and TikTok. The cases stem from lawsuits filed by thousands of individuals, school districts and state attorneys general, accusing the companies of making their products addictive, like cigarettes, and causing personal injury.\n\nThe plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages and changes to the design of social media platforms to curb excessive use. If they succeed in arguing that the tech titans created defective products that injured millions of young American users, the cases — which are regarded as bellwethers — could open new lanes of liability against the tech titans.\n\nTikTok and Snap have both now settled the first case, leaving Meta and YouTube as the remaining defendants. The case involves a 20-year-old California woman identified in a 2023 lawsuit as K.G.M. The woman said she had become addicted to the social media sites as a child and experienced anxiety, depression and body-image issues as a result. Meta’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and YouTube’s chief, Neal Mohan, are expected to testify.\n\nJoseph VanZandt, one of the lead lawyers for the plaintiff, confirmed the settlement but did not disclose details of the agreement. He said the trial against YouTube and Meta would proceed as scheduled\n\nMark Lanier, another lead lawyer for the plaintiff, said in a statement that “this is a good resolution, and we are pleased with the settlement.”\n\nTikTok did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTikTok and Snap are still defendants in more than a dozen other trials expected in state and federal courts this year. Roughly nine cases will be heard in the series of trials in Los Angeles. A second set of federal cases will go to trial this summer in Oakland, Calif., at the U.S. District Court of Northern California.\n\nThe lawsuits argue that features like infinite scroll, auto video play and algorithmic recommendations have led to compulsive social media use and caused depression, eating disorders and self-harm.\n\nThe companies deny the allegations and say there isn’t a clear link between social media use and addiction. They also point to a federal shield law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, that protects them from liability for what their users post online.",

    "fullText": "Filing by New Mexico’s attorney general includes Meta staff emails objecting to AI companion policy\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, approved allowing minors to access artificial intelligence chatbot companions that safety staffers warned were capable of sexual interactions, according to internal Meta documents filed in a New Mexico state court case and made public on Monday.\n\nThe lawsuit – brought by the state’s attorney general, Raul Torrez, and scheduled for trial next month – alleges Meta “failed to stem the tide of damaging sexual material and sexual propositions delivered to children” on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThe filing on Monday included internal Meta employee emails and messages obtained by the New Mexico attorney general’s office through legal discovery. The state alleges they show that “Meta, driven by Zuckerberg, rejected the recommendations of its integrity staff and declined to impose reasonable guardrails to prevent children from being subject to sexually exploitative conversations with its AI chatbots”, the attorney general said in the filing. Meta announced last week that it had removed teen access to AI companions entirely, pending creation of a new version of the chatbots.\n\nIn the communications, some of Meta’s safety staff expressed objections the company was building chatbots geared for companionship, including sexual and romantic interactions with users. The artificial intelligence chatbots were released in early 2024. The documents cited in the state’s filing Monday don’t include messages or memos authored by Zuckerberg.\n\nAndy Stone, a Meta spokesperson, on Monday said the state’s portrayal was inaccurate and relied on selective information: “This is yet another example of the New Mexico attorney general cherrypicking documents to paint a flawed and inaccurate picture.”\n\nMessages in the filing showed safety staff had special concern about the bots being used for romantic scenarios between adults and minors under the age of 18, referred to as “U18s”.\n\n“I don’t believe that creating and marketing a product that creates U18 romantic AI’s for adults is advisable or defensible,” wrote Ravi Sinha, head of Meta’s child safety policy, in January 2024.\n\nIn reply, Antigone Davis, Meta’s global safety head, agreed that safety staff should push to block adults from creating underage romantic companions because “it sexualizes minors”. Sinha and Davis did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAccording to one February 2024 message, a Meta employee whose name was redacted relayed that Zuckerberg believed that AI companions should be blocked from engaging in sexually “explicit” conversations with at least younger teens and that adults should not be able to interact with “U18 AIs for romance purposes”.\n\nA summary of a meeting dated 20 February 2024, said the CEO believed the “narrative should be framed around … general principles of choice and non-censorship”, that Meta should be “less restrictive than proposed”, and that he wanted to “allow adults to engage in racier conversation on topics like sex”.\n\nStone said the documents did not support New Mexico’s case. “Even these select documents clearly show Mark Zuckerberg giving the direction that explicit AIs shouldn’t be available to younger users and that adults shouldn’t be able to create under 18 AIs for romantic purposes.”\n\nMessages between two employees from March 2024 state that Zuckerberg had rejected creating parental controls for the chatbots, and that staffers were working on “Romance AI chatbots” that would be allowed for users under the age of 18.\n\nWe “pushed hard for parental controls to turn GenAI off – but GenAI leadership pushed back stating Mark decision”, one employee wrote in that exchange.\n\nNick Clegg, who was Meta’s head of global policy until early 2025, said in an email included in the court documents he thought Meta’s approach to sexualized AI companions was unwise.\n\nExpressing concern that sexual interactions could be the dominant use case for Meta’s AI companions by teenage users, Clegg said: “Is that really what we want these products to be known for (never mind the inevitable societal backlash which would ensue)?” Clegg did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMeta’s AI chatbot policies eventually came to light, prompting a backlash in the US Congress and elsewhere.\n\nA Wall Street Journal article in April 2025 found that Meta’s chatbots included overtly sexualized underage characters and that they engaged in all-ages sexual roleplay, including graphic descriptions of prepubescent bodies. Reuters reported in August that Meta’s official guidelines for chatbots stated that it is “acceptable to engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual”. In response to the report, Meta said it was changing its policies and that the internal document granting such approval had been in error.",

    "description": "This is just one in a long line of incidents that show that human-wildlife encounters often end poorly.",
    "fullText": "In 2022, a couple from Los Angeles was vacationing in a luxury treehouse in Truchas, New Mexico. As part of their stay, the couple booked a tour of the ranch where the treehouse was located, which included the chance to feed bison — an opportunity that allegedly ended with the woman being gored in the arm.\n\nNow, according to the Santa Fe New Mexican, the woman is suing the person who rented out the treehouse, the ranch owner, and the website where the treehouse was booked for unspecified damages related to the alleged incident.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Sarah Fiskin and her partner were feeding the bison pellets from a can. However, the lawsuit claims that once the pellets began running low, one bison, Junior, became agitated and started crowding Fiskin to get more.\n\nWhile doing that, according to the lawsuit and per the Santa Fe New Mexican, Junior \"violently swung his horns\" and gored Fiskin's arm, leaving her with \"a massive gaping puncture wound.\" As a result, Fiskin claims she needed surgery, and the incident left her with permanent and severe physical and psychological injuries.\n\nWhile the website and the ranch owner declined to comment on the matter, Sandra Webb, the woman who rented the property, shared a different version of events. According to Webb, Fiskin dropped one of the pellets on the ground, which Junior bent down to get. Upon lifting his head, one of Junior's horns caught Fiskin's arm.\n\nWebb also shared that she and her insurance company have tried for the past several years to settle the matter, including an offer of roughly $300,000, but the other side declined.\n\nThis is just one in a long line of incidents that show that human-wildlife encounters often end poorly. However, it's important to note that just as often, they also end poorly for the animal involved. If Junior were a wild bison, chances are good that wildlife authorities would have tracked him down and euthanized him for this incident, as that's typically what happens.\n\nWhether animals appear to be tame, as Webb claimed these bison were, or not, it's advisable to stay far away from wildlife of all kinds to prevent injury.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "title": "The US is facing a wrongful-death lawsuit after a lethal strike on a boat it says was smuggling drugs",
    "description": "Two Trinidadian nationals were said to be among six people killed by a US strike. The lawsuit characterized the strike as 'unlawful.'",
    "fullText": "The US armed forces have for months been carrying out lethal strikes against vessels it says were engaged in drug smuggling in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific. Now, the families of two men killed in one of those strikes are suing the US government for damages.\n\nTwo family members of Trinidadian nationals said to have been killed in a US boat strike in the Caribbean have accused the federal government of engaging in \"unlawful\" activity.\n\nThis case appears to mark the first wrongful-death lawsuit filed in federal court against the Trump administration in response to the strikes. Since September, the US has killed more than 100 people in this campaign.\n\nThe lawsuit identified two men, Chad Joseph and Rishi Samaroo, as having been among the six people killed on October 14, 2025. The lawsuit said that a US missile struck their vessel while it was sailing from Venezuela to Trinidad. Joseph and Samaroo were returning home after fishing in waters off the Venezuelan coast and working on farms in the country, the complaint said.\n\nJoseph, 26 at the time of his death, lived in Las Cuevas, Trinidad, per the lawsuit. The filing says that he had tried to return to Trinidad earlier in the summer but was unable to travel after the boat he planned to take experienced engine trouble. He later secured another ride home in October.\n\nSamaroo, 41 at the time of his death and also a resident of Las Cuevas, had been working on a farm in Venezuela after his early release on parole, according to the lawsuit, which says he had previously served 15 years in prison for a homicide conviction.\n\nThe attack on the boat \"was part of an unprecedented and manifestly unlawful US military campaign,\" the suit, filed in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts, added, calling them \"premeditated and intentional killings\" that \"lack any plausible legal justification.\" It argued there's no situation in which such action would have been acceptable.\n\nAt the time of the boat strike, President Donald Trump characterized the six men as \"narcoterrorists\" and said the boat was \"associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks\" and was involved in the trafficking of narcotics along a known route.\n\nThe lawsuit rejected these claims, saying Joseph and Samaroo weren't members of or affiliated with drug cartels. The filing further stated that the Trinidadian government has \"no information linking Joseph or Samaroo to illegal activities.\"\n\nJoseph's mother, Lenore Burnley, and Samaroo's sister, Sallycar Korasingh, are named as the plaintiffs in this new lawsuit. The filing invokes the Death on the High Seas Act and the Alien Tort Statute, federal laws that allow families to pursue wrongful-death claims arising in international waters and, in some cases, allege violations of international law in US courts.\n\n\"These premeditated and intentional killings lack any plausible legal justification,\" the lawsuit said. \"Thus they were simply murders, ordered by individuals at the highest levels of government and obeyed by military officers in the chain of command.\"\n\nThe White House told Business Insider in a request for comment that \"The October 14 strike was conducted against narcoterrorists,\" and that Trump \"used his lawful authority to take decisive action against the scourge of illicit narcotics\" coming into the US. The Department of Defense said it does not comment on ongoing litigation as a matter of policy.\n\nLawmakers, officials, and experts across fields have debated the legality of the US campaign since it began in September. The Trump administration has justified its attacks, saying the targets are people and vessels bringing drugs into the US.\n\nLegal experts, though, have said that the strikes don't follow the proper protocols for interdicting alleged drug trafficking vessels and have questionable legal backing. Lethal action is not the norm for US counter-narcotics operations. Multiple reports on these operations aimed at stemming the flow of drugs into the US have raised concerns about the violation of the laws of armed conflict.",

    "fullText": "An ecologist with a phobia of leaving the house took her employer to court after not being invited to her office Christmas party.\n\nShelby Caughman, who has agoraphobia, sued for disability harassment when she was snubbed from the eight-person event over fears that it would cause her too much anxiety.\n\nMs Caughman was on sick leave at the time, partly because of her mental health, and had said she was too “overwhelmed” to return to work until January.\n\nHer case was dismissed at tribunal in Scotland, as a judge ruled that purposefully excluding a colleague from a work event because they have anxiety is acceptable under UK employment laws.\n\nPeople with agoraphobia have a fear of going outside into crowded places, and are commonly scared of leaving their homes, travelling on public transport and visiting busy shopping centres.\n\nThe tribunal heard that Ms Caughman started working for Echoes Ecology as a consultant ecologist in April 2023, alongside seven other colleagues.\n\nShe suffered from ADHD, autism, complex post-traumatic stress disorder and agoraphobia, and had made the company aware of her conditions.\n\nMs Caughman made several grievance complaints to the company from a “build up of work stress” and a “lack of reasonable adjustments”.\n\nIn June 2024, she took a week off as statutory sick pay after she had issues with her mental health. Following this, she agreed to a phased return to work.\n\nMs Caughman went on sick leave at the start of July 2024, however, and did not return to work until she resigned in February 2025.\n\nDuring this time, Echoes Ecology got in touch with her to see if she was well enough to return to work.\n\nAn occupational health report was made which claimed that Ms Caughman needed adjustments to be made, including flexible working hours and being able to work from home.\n\nThe report also stated that she wanted to be exempt from team meetings and social gatherings.\n\nAfter the report was produced, Ms Caughman clarified that she did not agree with the wording around exemption from meetings and social gatherings because she enjoyed social gatherings and “just wanted a choice”.\n\nAlthough she was supposed to return to work in December, she said it was making her feel “overwhelmed” and discussed moving the return date into the new year.\n\nThe company held the Christmas party in December, and decided not to invite Ms Caughman to “avoid creating further anxiety”.\n\nMs Caughman sent an email regarding the invite snub, and was told that the company thought it would be “insensitive” to have invited her, but apologised if they had misinterpreted the situation.\n\nThe tribunal ruled that not inviting Ms Caughman to the Christmas party was discrimination, but it was a “justified” reaction to her comments about her agoraphobia.\n\nEmployment Judge Peter O’Donnell said: “[Echoes Ecology] clearly had the legitimate aim of seeking to avoid causing [Ms Caughman] additional distress of inviting her to an event where it appeared that she did not wish to attend and would not be fit to do so.\n\n“The Tribunal accepts that it was not [Ms Caughman’s] position that she did not wish to attend the Christmas night but the Tribunal also accepts that it was Echoes Ecology’s genuine belief that she did not, even if this was mistaken.\n\n“There was a factual basis for [Echoes Ecology’s] belief in the content of the OH report and there was nothing to contradict this.”\n\nMs Caughman also unsuccessfully claimed for harassment, victimisation, reasonable adjustment and constructive dismissal.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide and needs support now, call or text 988 or chat with the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988lifeline.org.\n\nStanford and the family of Katie Meyer have settled a wrongful death lawsuit concerning the former soccer star's death by suicide in 2022.\n\nStanford and Meyer's family issued a joint statement Monday announcing the settlement. Meyer's family filed the lawsuit in November 2022, eight months after Meyer's death. It stated that \"the actions that led to the death of Katie Meyer began and ended with Stanford University.\"\n\nPer the lawsuit, Meyer faced disciplinary action from the university at the time of her death due to an allegation that she spilled coffee on a football player who was accused of sexually assaulting one of her teammates.\n\nThe lawsuit stated that a disciplinary letter from Stanford's office of community standards to Meyer \"contained threatening language regarding sanctions and potential 'removal from the university.'\" Per the lawsuit, Meyer received the letter on the night of her death.\n\nAt the time, Stanford spokesperson Dee Mostofi disputed the lawsuit's claim that the university was responsible for Meyer's death in statements to media.\n\nMonday's announcement did not disclose the terms of the settlement, but it did announce initiatives put in place in Meyer's honor.\n\n\"To honor Katie, Stanford will collaborate with Katie’s family to launch an initiative focused on the mental health and well-being of student-athletes at the Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute,\" the statement reads. \"Stanford Athletics will establish the Katie Meyer Leadership Award to be given to an exceptional Stanford student-athlete each year.\"\n\nThe statement also announced that Stanford will amend its disciplinary procedures to meet a California Law named after Meyer requiring that students in the the state's public college system have access to an independent adviser of their choice when facing a disciplinary hearing. Stanford is private and not subject to the law.\n\n\"In addition, Stanford will adopt the principles of Katie Meyer’s Law to provide support to students in its OCS disciplinary process,\" the statement reads.\n\nStanford women's soccer will retire Meyer's No. 19, per the agreement.\n\nMeyer was the starting goaltender on the 2019 Stanford team that won the NCAA championship. She came up with critical saves in a penalty shootout to secure Stanford's win over North Carolina in the title game.",

    "description": "The lawsuit was filed by an international group of plaintiffs.",
    "fullText": "Shortly after Meta (then Facebook) bought WhatsApp in 2014, it promised to implement a surprisingly un-Facebooky feature: End-to-end encryption. The move was supposed to be a boon for privacy, ensuring nobody could see your messages aside from the recipient and yourself. Even now, WhatsApp's website claims, \"No one outside of the chat, not even WhatsApp, can read, listen to, or share [your messages].\" However, a new lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco is now claiming that's not the case.\n\nAccording to reporting from Bloomberg, an international group of plaintiffs has sued Meta, saying that the app's claims of end-to-end encryption are a lie. The lawsuit alleges that Meta and WhatsApp \"store, analyze, and can access virtually all of WhatsApp user's purportedly 'private' communications.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs include users from Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico, and South Africa, who are being represented by attorneys from several firms. The allegations cite \"whistleblowers\" who helped bring this information to light, but no more is known as of yet.\n\nWhen I reached out to Meta for comment, Meta strongly denied the allegations. The company called the lawsuit \"frivolous,\" assuring users that WhatsApp uses the open-source Signal protocol for encryption and adding that \"[a]ny claim that people's WhatsApp messages are not encrypted is categorically false and absurd.\"\n\nIf the lawsuit succeeds, it could affect billions of users around the world. That's because the plaintiffs' lawyers are asking the court to certify a class-action lawsuit.\n\nIn the meantime, WhatApp is far from the only option for encrypted messaging apps. While it's unclear how the lawsuit will proceed, those looking to jump ship might want to look at alternatives like Signal or Viber instead. Note that some apps, like Telegram, do offer end-to-end encryption, but don't enable it by default. (Personally I use Line, because of the anime stickers.)",

Come back, be here,\" or even sassy, like, \"Good thing I like my friends canceled.\"\n\nWell, thanks to a slew of newly unsealed court documents, we now have evidence that's not far from the truth.\n\n\"I think I'm just exhausted in every avenue of my life,\" Swift seemingly wrote to her friend Blake Lively in December 2024. \"You don't need to apologize. Just come back please.\" Earlier that year, Swift apparently praised her longtime friend's tenacity: \"No one. Should ever. Get into a war of wills with you.\"\n\nSeveral text messages between Swift and Lively were recently made public amid Lively's legal battle with Justin Baldoni, her director and costar on the hit 2024 movie \"It Ends with Us.\" These particular texts presumably became relevant to the lawsuit because Baldoni's name was mentioned (or alluded to, as when Lively wrote to Swift about \"this doofus director of my movie\"). In some cases, they speak to Lively's state of mind while the two actors were filming \"It Ends With Us,\" and amid the breakdown of Lively and Baldoni's working relationship.\n\nDespite these nuggets of insight, however, some of the most interesting details of Lively's conversations with Swift are the ones that offer a unique glimpse into Swift's writerly craft.\n\nSwift is already renowned for her lyricism. The same week these texts were unsealed, she became the youngest woman ever to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame — in her very first year of eligibility, no less. But these texts reveal a less polished, less reputation-conscious version of Swift's communication style.\n\nAccording to these court documents, Lively texted Swift on December 4, 2024, shortly before the end of the Eras Tour, to temperature-check their friendship. Lively and Swift have been close friends for years (Swift is the godmother to Lively's children), but the actor felt that something in their dynamic had shifted.\n\n\"Hey, just checking in,\" Lively wrote to Swift. \"I have no reason to ask, but I donno, l've been feeling like I should… is everything OK?\"\n\nLively went on to say she felt like a \"bad friend lately,\" that she didn't want to come across as \"needy and awkward,\" but her gut (and her husband, Ryan Reynolds) told her to reach out anyway. \"I always want the opportunity to be a better friend if there's something I unintentionally did,\" she wrote.\n\nIf you've ever gone through a rough patch with a loved one, then this brand of ambient, unsettled anxiety will surely feel familiar. It's really hard to communicate complex emotions, especially when an important relationship is at stake, and the conversation isn't face-to-face.\n\nLuckily, written communication of complex emotions is exactly Swift's forte.\n\n\"I feel really bad saying anything about this because your texts have been so nice in their intent but your last few… it's felt like I was reading a mass corporate email sent to 200 employees,\" Swift replied in part. \"You said the word 'we' like 18 times. And it feels awful to be in any way critical of any way you process what you've been going through but I just kinda miss my funny, dark, normal-speaking friend who talks to me as herself, not like. A plural unit.\"\n\nShe added: \"I know you feel attacked from all sides for ridiculous reasons so you're feeling like you have to overly explain things or be overly nice or whatever but. It's me! That's just caused a little distance.\"\n\nSwift's response is exactly what I'd hope to receive from a friend in that position: open-hearted and generous, yet firm and forthright. She doesn't treat Lively with kid gloves, nor does she pile on. Instead, she validates her friend's anxiety, clarifies her own perspective, and reinforces their bond.\n\nOver the past two decades, Swift has built an empire by making fans feel like her friends, writing songs that sound like heart-to-hearts. It's oddly comforting to know that Swift writes to her actual friends with the same attention to detail.",

The encampment was near Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King had preached and now the site of annual events to honor him.\n\nPartners for HOME is the city's lead agency on homelessness. SafeHouse Outreach is another Atlanta nonprofit that serves unhoused people. The lawsuit says the organizations should have known to check Taylor's tent after they did outreach at the site in advance.\n\nCathryn Vassell, CEO of Partners for HOME, said the nonprofit cannot comment on the lawsuit because they have not seen it but “is committed to its mission making homelessness in Atlanta rare, brief and nonrecurring.\" SafeHouse Outreach did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nTaylor's family sued the city of Atlanta in July, alleging city employees also should have checked whether Taylor was in his tent.\n\nTaylor’s death sparked outrage among local advocates and neighbors at the encampment who at the time called the city’s policies on clearing encampments inhumane. They said the city faces a dire affordable housing shortage that makes it inevitable that people will end up living on the streets.\n\nRight after Taylor’s death, the city put a temporary moratorium on encampment sweeps. With the FIFA World Cup coming to Atlanta this Summer, the city has since resumed clearing encampments with the goal of eliminating all homelessness in the downtown area before then. Partners for HOME is close to its goal of housing 400 people ahead of the World Cup, said Vassell.\n\nThe lawsuit filed Friday seeks unspecified damages as well as compensation for medical and hospital bills, burial costs, attorney’s fees and litigation costs.\n\nHarold Spence, one of the lawyers representing the family, said at a news conference Friday that city officials and the nonprofit employees didn’t want the “dignitaries” attending the Martin Luther King Jr. event to see the encampment.\n\n“They were in a rush to remove it,” Spence said. “Unfortunately, it turned out they were willing to remove it at any cost.”\n\nSpence added that Taylor had recently secured a job and was ready to “turn his life around.”\n\nKramon is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

    "description": "A federal judge in Georgia on Friday dismissed a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit seeking voter information from the state, ruling the federal government had sued in the wrong city.  U.S.",
    "fullText": "ATLANTA (AP) — A federal judge in Georgia on Friday dismissed a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit seeking voter information from the state, ruling the federal government had sued in the wrong city.\n\nU.S. District Judge Ashley Royal found the government should have sued Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in Atlanta, and not in a separate federal judicial district in Macon, where the secretary of state also has an office.\n\nRoyal dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice, meaning the Justice Department can refile it. The department declined to comment Friday.\n\nThe Justice Department has now filed lawsuits against 24 states and the District of Columbia seeking voter information as part of its effort to collect detailed voting data, including dates of birth and driver’s license and Social Security numbers. A federal judge in California rejected the lawsuit against that state on privacy grounds, while a judge in Oregon has suggested he may dismiss the case there.\n\nThe Trump administration characterizes the lawsuits as an effort to ensure election security, and the Justice Department says the states are violating federal law by refusing to provide voter lists and information.\n\nRaffensperger has been the rare Republican to decline the demand, saying Georgia law prohibits the release of voters' confidential personal unless certain qualifications are met. Raffensperger argues the federal government hasn't met those conditions. He says he shared the public part of the voter roll and information about how Georgia removes ineligible or outdated registrations in December.\n\n“I will always follow the law and follow the Constitution,” Raffensperger said in a statement Friday. “I won't violate the oath I took to stand up for the people of this state, regardless of who or what compels me to do otherwise.”\n\nThe refusal to hand over the records has become an issue in Raffensperger's 2026 run for governor. Raffensperger in January 2021 famously refused a demand from President Donald Trump in a phone call to “find” enough votes to overturn Democrat Joe Biden’s win in Georgia's 2020 presidential election. Many Trump-loving Republicans still hold a grudge against Raffensperger.\n\nThe issue flared just Thursday in a hearing by a state Senate committee where multiple Republican state senators slammed Raffensperger for failing to comply, saying he legally could do so. The committee voted along party lines to advance a resolution calling on Raffensperger to hand over the data and calling it the “latest example of a pattern of behavior by the secretary and his office to refuse oversight of his administration of Georgia’s elections.”\n\nState Sen. Randy Robertson, a Republican from Cataula who filed the resolution, said the dismissal is “frustrating” because even if the Justice Department refiles the lawsuit, the problem will take longer to resolve.\n\n“As public officials we all should participate in any investigation done by a law enforcement agency,” Robertson told The Associated Press Friday.\n\nRobertson is one of many Republican lawmakers backing Lt. Gov. Burt Jones over Raffensperger for the GOP governor nomination. Jones, who already has Trump's endorsement for governor, was one of 16 state Republicans who signed a certificate that Trump had won Georgia and declaring themselves the state’s “duly elected and qualified” electors.",

    "description": "The relationship between President Donald Trump and JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon has oscillated between public barbs and admissions of respect.",
    "fullText": "Jamie Dimon is known for saying what he thinks. At Davos, the JPMorgan CEO was uncharacteristically constrained when talking about Donald Trump and his policies, striking a cautious balance between criticism and praise. \n\nThis is a familiar dance in a relationship that has swung between mutual respect and open hostility since Trump first took office in 2016.\n\nDimon, who once described himself as \"barely a Democrat,\" has publicly criticized some of Trump's economic and political policies, including on tariffs, while also praising his deregulatory moves and efforts to grow the economy.\n\n\"He was kind of right about NATO. Kind of right about immigration. He grew the economy quite well. Tax reform worked. He was right about some of China,\" Dimon said in Davos in 2024, while in the same breath saying he didn't like some of Trump's rhetoric.\n\nNow that Trump has filed suit against Dimon and JPMorgan for $5 billion over claims of politically-motivated debanking, here's a look at their relationship over the years.\n\nAlthough he financially supported Hillary Clinton's 2008 run for office, Dimon didn't publicly endorse a candidate that year, in 2012, or in 2016. He said in a memo following Trump's victory that his win reflected a \"deep desire for change\" across the country.\n\nThe JPMorgan CEO sat on Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum, a group that first met in February of 2017 and focused on how government policies affected economic growth. After Trump's inflammatory response to a violent white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, members of the council, including Dimon, decided to disband the group.\n\nShortly thereafter, Trump announced that he was disbanding the group in a post on then-Twitter.\n\nTrump said in the recent lawsuit that JPMorgan told him in February 2021 that it was closing his accounts, along with accounts of some of his family's businesses. Trump, along with some other conservatives, has criticized perceived politically motivated \"debanking\" in recent months, claiming that JPMorgan and other banks have shut down the accounts of conservatives.\n\nDuring the 2024 Republican primaries, Dimon openly praised former UN ambassador Nikki Haley and advised Democrats to support her if they didn't want to face Trump again.\n\n\"Even if you're a very liberal Democrat, I urge you, help Nikki Haley, too,\" he said at the DealBook Summit. \"Get a choice on the Republican side that might be better than Trump.\"\n\nDimon also said he was ready to work with Trump again, should he win reelection.\n\nThe banker's call for supporting Haley drew Trump's ire, with the then-former president calling Dimon a \"highly overrated globalist\" in a Truth Social post.\n\nTrump's tone on Dimon changed during a 2024 interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, in which he said he had \"a lot of respect\" for the JPMorgan CEO.\n\n\"He is somebody that I would consider, sure,\" he added when asked if Dimon could be his next Treasury Secretary.\n\nTrump ramped up pressure on Dimon in the lead-up to the 2024 election, posting on Truth Social that Dimon had endorsed him.\n\nDimon denied he'd endorsed Trump through a JPMorgan spokesperson.\n\nThe pair's public relationship grew tense again in the summer of 2025, after Trump signed an executive order for federal banking regulators to eliminate guidance that encourages what he calls \"politicized\" or \"unlawful\" debanking.\n\nTrump told CNBC that JPMorgan and Bank of America had refused to accept his deposits, saying that the financial institutions \"discriminate against many conservatives.\"\n\nTrump's claims of discrimination gave way to his $5 billion lawsuit against JPMorgan and its CEO. The bank denies any wrongdoing related to the closure of Trump's accounts, saying that account closures are sometimes required \"because they create legal or regulatory risk for the company.\"\n\n\"We regret having to do so but often rules and regulatory expectations lead us to do so,\" reads a January statement from JPMorgan.\n\nHowever, the suit isn't the only recent point of tension between Trump and Dimon. Dimon has become more outspoken in his opposition to some of Trump's latest economic policies, including lambasting Trump's proposed 10% cap on credit card interest as an \"economic disaster.\"\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum, Dimon predicted that, if enacted, the cap could strip credit from 80% of Americans.\n\nIn a January interview with the Chamber of Commerce, Dimon also reiterated his belief in the Fed's independence, which has come into question in recent days amid the Justice Department's investigation into the central bank.\n\nDimon said there was \"absolutely, positively, no chance, no way, no how for any reason\" that he would serve as Fed Chair, but he did say he would \"consider\" the job of Treasury Secretary — if it was offered.\n\nHe'd need to understand \"what they want and how they want to operate\" before making a decision, Dimon said.",

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled on Thursday that the academics, who are party to a lawsuit alleging U.S. policy singles out noncitizens for detention or deportation over their pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses, can seek relief from the court if their immigration status is changed as retribution for taking part in the case.\n\nThe ruling from U.S. District Judge William Young comes in the wake of trial last year, in which he ruled the Trump administration violated the Constitution when it targeted non-U.S. citizens for deportation solely for supporting Palestinians and criticizing Israel. Young repeatedly chastised the administration for violating the First Amendment rights of the plaintiffs and, on Thursday, issued what he described as “remedial sanction to protect certain of the Plaintiffs’ noncitizen members from any retribution for the free exercise of their constitutional rights.”\n\nDuring the hearing in the case earlier this month, Young maintained that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and their agents had engaged in an “unconstitutional conspiracy” to limit the free speech of the plaintiffs, creating a chilling effect on their rights by their attempts to “pick off certain people.”\n\n“The big problem in this case is that the cabinet secretaries, ostensibly and president of the United States, are not honoring the First Amendment,” said Young, an appointee of the late Republican President Ronald Reagan. “There doesn’t seem to be an understanding of what the First Amendment is by this government.”\n\nIn his ruling, Young said that a noncitizen challenging his or her immigration status change would have to prove that they were a member of the American Association of University Professors and Middle East Studies Association, the two groups that sued, between March 25, 2025, and Sept. 30, 2025. They would also have to show their immigration status had not expired and had not committed any crime after Sept. 30, 2025. The Associated Press is not aware of any members of these groups whose status has changed because they are part of the lawsuit.\n\n“Upon such proof, it shall be presumed that the alteration in immigration status is in retribution for the exercise during the course of the present case of their First Amendment rights,” Young wrote.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment\n\nDuring last year's trial, witnesses for the government acknowledged that the campaign targeted more than 5,000 pro-Palestinian protesters. Other witnesses for the plaintiffs testified to how the campaign stoked fear among academics and prompted some to stop their activism.\n\nAmong the cases that have fueled the lawsuit was that of former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil. Earlier this month, a federal appeals panel reversed a lower court decision that released Khalil from an immigration jail, bringing the government one step closer to detaining and ultimately deporting the Palestinian activist.\n\nThe three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals didn’t decide the key issue in Khalil’s case: whether the Trump administration’s effort to throw Khalil out of the U.S. over his campus activism and criticism of Israel was unconstitutional.\n\nBut in its 2-1 decision, the panel ruled a federal judge in New Jersey didn’t have jurisdiction to decide the matter at this time. Federal law requires the case to fully move through the immigration courts first, before Khalil can challenge the decision, they wrote.\n\nThe decision marked a major win for the Trump administration’s sweeping campaign to detain and deport noncitizens who joined protests against Israel. But it was not immediately clear whether the government would seek to detain Khalil, a legal permanent resident, again while his legal challenges continue.\n\nAnother was the Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was released in May from six weeks of detention after being arrested on a suburban Boston street. She said she was illegally detained following an op-ed piece she co-wrote last year criticizing her school’s response to Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nDuring the latest hearing in the case, Young repeatedly seemed baffled that the country's top leaders would attempt to implement such a policy.\n\n“How could this happen? How could our government’s highest officials seek to so infringe on the rights of people lawfully here in the United States,” he told the court. “The record in this case convinces me that these high officials, and I include the president of the United States, have a fearful view of freedom.”\n\nRamya Krishnan, senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute, which argued for relief in court, said the “administration’s lawless efforts to deport pro-Palestinian advocates has spread terror in our campus communities.”\n\n“Students and scholars shouldn’t have to live in fear that ICE agents could seize them from their homes merely for engaging in political expression,” she said. “Today’s judgment makes emphatically clear that the administration’s campaign of intimidation must end.”",

The filing in the Western District of North Carolina — the same court that just heard the Michael Jordan-led antitrust suit against NASCAR — alleges the Buschs purchased five separate Indexed Universal Life policies between 2018 and 2022 to provide more than $90 million in insurance protection for the two-time NASCAR champion.  Pacific Life claims Busch failed to fully fund the policies, let some lapse and surrendered the others.",
    "fullText": "Pacific Life Insurance Company on Thursday asked a federal court to dismiss the $8.5 million lawsuit filed by NASCAR champion Kyle Busch and his wife over policies the Buschs claim were sold to them under false and negligent representations as tax-free income for retirement.\n\nThe filing in the Western District of North Carolina — the same court that just heard the Michael Jordan-led antitrust suit against NASCAR — alleges the Buschs purchased five separate Indexed Universal Life policies between 2018 and 2022 to provide more than $90 million in insurance protection for the two-time NASCAR champion.\n\nThe IUL policies were intended to provide immediate death benefit protection and “the opportunity to accumulate cash values when the policies are held for the long term.”\n\nPacific Life claims Busch failed to fully fund the policies, let some lapse and surrendered the others. Busch has claimed he is out $10.4 million and filed suit in October alleging Pacific Life failed to reveal the true risks of the policies.\n\nPacific Life countered in its request to have the suit dismissed that both Buschs signed multiple documents acknowledging they understood the policies, including one that indicated the couple would pay planned premiums and hold the policies over 30 years through age 70 and beyond.\n\n“Instead of keeping the policies long enough to capitalize on their growth potential, Plaintiffs failed to timely pay planned premiums, failed to monitor allocation of their policy values between indexed and fixed accounts and surrendered the policies or allowed them to lapse,” Pacific Life wrote in the filing. “Rather than accept responsibility for their own decisions, Plaintiffs now attempt to blame their negative outcome on the IUL product.”\n\nAn IUL is a combination life insurance policy that provides a death benefit with a cash value component. The cash value growth is tied to a stock market index, supposedly with built-in protections against market downturns.\n\nWhen he filed the suit last year, Busch said he was told that if he paid $1 million for five years, he would be able to take out $800,000 a year once he turned 52. Busch claims when he received a sixth premium notice he began asking questions and discovered almost all of his money was gone.\n\nPacific Life has countered that the Buschs acknowledged understanding the policies, but also that his claims for breach of fiduciary and negligent misrepresentation come seven years after he began purchasing the policies and are therefore outside the three-year statute of limitations.\n\n“A plaintiff cannot avoid the statute of limitations by remaining ‘willfully blind’: A man should not be allowed to close his eyes to the facts readily observable by ordinary attention, and maintain for his own advantage the position of ignorance,\" Pacific Life wrote. “Such a principle would enable a careless man, and by reason of his carelessness, to extend his right to recover for an indefinite length of time.”\n\nPacific Life also maintains that all of the Buschs claims on misrepresentation are false due to the “express, repeated disclosures\" they signed. Additionally, all five policies come with a cover letter that in bold capitalized letters says “READ YOUR POLICY CAREFULLY” and offered a 20-day cancelation window in which premiums would be refunded.\n\nBoth Buschs signed a form that certified they had received the policies and understood they must carefully review them, Pacific Life said.\n\nThe Buschs also named agent Rodney A. Smith in their lawsuit for steering the Buschs into an unsustainable, high-risk product, along with charging an up-front 35% commission they were unaware of.\n\nAP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",

In August, the bank said in a statement to Reuters that it does not close accounts for political reasons.\n\nTrump has previously criticized some big banks for allegedly denying services to conservatives, telling CNBC in August that JPMorgan and Bank of America had previously refused to accept his deposits.

    "title": "Spotify Lawsuit Triggered Anna's Archive Domain Name Suspensions",
    "description": "Spotify and several major record label have taken legal action against the unknown operators of Anna's Archive.",
    "fullText": "Anna’s Archive is generally known as a meta-search engine for shadow libraries, helping users find pirated books and other related resources.\n\nHowever, in December, the site announced that it had also backed up Spotify, which came as a shock to the music industry.\n\nWhile Anna’s Archive initially released only Spotify metadata, and no actual music, the industry was on high alert. Over Christmas, Spotify and the major labels prepared a legal response in U.S. federal court.\n\nOn December 29, Spotify, UMG, Sony, Warner, and other labels filed their complaint at the Southern District of New York. They accuse Anna’s Archive of mass copyright infringement, breach of contract, DMCA violations, and violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Anna’s Archive “brazenly” circumvented Spotify’s DRM. The site scraped 86 million music files and metadata for 256 million tracks from Spotify, which would all eventually be released publicly.\n\n“…Anna’s Archive has threatened to imminently mass-release and freely distribute its pirated copies of the sound recording files to the public, without authorization from or compensation to the relevant rights holders. Such widespread and illegal infringement would irreparably harm the music industry..,” the complaint reads.\n\nThe complaint comes with a request for a preliminary injunction and a restraining order that aim to take Anna’s Archive offline. All these documents were filed under seal, as the shadow library might otherwise be tipped off and take countermeasures.\n\nThese documents were filed ex-parte and kept away from Anna’s Archive. According to Spotify and the labels, this is needed “so that Anna’s Archive cannot pre-emptively frustrate” the countermeasures they seek.\n\nThe lawsuit, which was unsealed recently, explains directly why Anna’s Archive lost several of its domain names over the past weeks. The .ORG domain was suspended by the U.S.-based Public Interest Registry (PIR) in early January, while a domain registrar took the .SE variant offline a few days later.\n\n“We don’t believe this has to do with our Spotify backup,” AnnaArchivist said at the time, but court records prove them wrong.\n\nThe unsealed paperwork shows that the court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) on January 2, which aimed to target Anna’s Archive hosting and domain names. The sealed nature of this order also explains why the .ORG registry informed us that it could not comment on the suspension last week.\n\nWhile the .ORG and the .SE domains are suspended now, other domains remain operational. This suggests that the responsible registrars and registries do not automatically comply with U.S. court orders.\n\nWhile the TRO was not public, a preliminary injunction that was issued by U.S. District Court Judge Jed Rakoff on January 16th shows how broad the granted powers are.\n\nAfter reviewing the evidence, and without a defense, the court concluded that the music companies’ copyright infringement claim will hold up. Therefore, the court ordered that Anna’s Archive is enjoined from ‘hosting, linking to, [or] distributing’ the copyrighted works.\n\nSince it’s uncertain whether Anna’s Archive will comply, the injunction also targets many third-party intermediaries, including domain registries and registrars, hosting companies, and other service providers.\n\nThese companies should assist in stopping the infringing activity on Anna’s Archive.\n\nTo avoid uncertainty, the court explicitly mentions that the targeted companies include the Public Interest Registry; Cloudflare Inc.; Switch Foundation; The Swedish Internet\n\nFoundation; National Internet Exchange of India; Njalla SRL; IQWeb FZ-LLC; Immaterialism Ltd.; Hosting Concepts B.V.; and Tucows Domains Inc.\n\nThe addition of Cloudflare stands out because the company operates a proxy service, without hosting Anna’s Archive’s content permanently. However, that was sufficient for the court to issue the order.\n\nWhile the unsealed documents resolve the domain suspension mystery, it is only the start of the legal battle in court. It is expected that Spotify and the music companies will do everything in their power to take further action, if needed.\n\nInterestingly, however, it appears that the music industry lawsuit may have already reached its goal. A few days ago, the dedicated Spotify download section was removed by Anna’s Archive.\n\nWhether this removal is linked to the legal troubles is unknown. However, it appears that Anna’s Archive stopped the specific distribution of Spotify content alleged in the complaint, seemingly in partial compliance with the injunction’s ban on ‘making available’ the scraped files.\n\nWhether this will mean that all troubles are now over has yet to be seen. For now, the copyright infringement allegations and other claims remain unresolved in court.\n\nA copy of the unsealed complaint filed by Spotify and the labels is available here (pdf). The preliminary injunction can be found here (pdf).",

Last year a Los Angeles judge ruled that the platforms’ design features may be responsible for harm – and not just the third-party content posted on sites and apps.\n\nHistorically, tech firms have turned to section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law underpinning US internet regulation that exempts platforms from legal liability for content generated by its users, as part of their legal defence. The first bellwether case is still due to begin on 27 January with jury selection.\n\nSnap remains a defendant in the other two cases.\n\nBeasley Allen, a law firm involved in the lawsuits on the plaintiff side, has said the cases could have profound consequences including billions of dollars in damages, forcing changes in platform design and new US regulations governing how tech firms interact with minors.\n\n“The litigation is being compared to past landmark cases against big tobacco and opioid manufacturers – industries that were held accountable for public health harms after years of denial,” the firm said in a statement last year.\n\nSnap, Meta, TikTok and YouTube have been contacted for comment.",

    "title": "Uber, often sued over car crashes, pushes for law to limit lawyer fees",
    "description": "The ride share giant is advocating for changes to California law that would limit how much lawyers can collect in fees. Attorneys say it will obliterate their personal injury practices and leave victims unable to sue.",
    "fullText": "This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here.\n\nThe long-simmering fight between some of L.A.’s best-known billboard attorneys and Uber, one of their most frequent targets, is poised to spill out of the courtroom and onto the November ballot.\n\nThe ride-share giant is gathering signatures for an initiative that, if passed by voters, would cap how much attorneys can earn in vehicle collision cases. The company pledges the change will give victims a larger cut of their settlement money, alleging predatory attorneys are inflating medical bills to increase their own profits.\n\nLawyers claim it will decimate their lucrative niche — car crash lawsuits in the automobile haven that is California — and ultimately leave thousands of people with small or challenging cases unable to sue because they can’t find an attorney.\n\nThis fight, lawyers say, is existential.\n\nAttorneys from Sweet James and Jacoby & Meyers — the names and faces of which will be imprinted in the minds of most California drivers — have given almost $1 million to a committee opposing the ballot measure, according to campaign filings. Dozens of other deep-pocketed attorneys have joined, raising an impressive war chest already surpassing $46 million.\n\n“Uber knows darn well what they’ve done,” said Nicholas Rowley, among those leading the opposition. “This law is designed to wipe out ordinary working people’s ability to get representation.”\n\nAttorneys have condemned the fee cap as a Trojan horse meant to trick voters into wrecking the delicate math behind personal injury lawsuits. Currently, personal injury attorneys typically take 33% to 40% of a client’s payout. That is enough, they say, for them to earn a living and risk taking cases on a contingency fee basis — meaning, if they lose, they don’t get paid.\n\nUber’s proposal would cap attorney fees for car crash cases at 25% and require extra costs — filing fees, depositions, experts — to be calculated before the fee split rather than coming out of the client’s portion.\n\nThe two sides have conflicting views of who would be expected to pay for medical fees, which often drain a significant portion of an injured client’s payout. Attorneys said in order to guarantee clients get 75% of the money, lawyers will have to foot the bill for these medical costs, opening the possibility they would walk away with nothing. Uber said the question of who covers medical costs is “not contemplated by the measure” and it expects clients would pay.\n\nThe measure would tightly limit what medical expenses can be claimed and curb most damages to rates based on insurance. A doctor-led political action committee opposing the measure has raised more than $4 million, according to campaign finance records, arguing it will prevent Californians from getting treatment.\n\nUber said in a statement that nothing in the measure prevents car accident victims from securing doctors and lawyers. Instead, the company said, the measure is aimed at tackling a perennial problem in California’s legal system: attorneys pushing car crash victims into expensive surgeries in order to fatten their fees. The only Californians affected, Uber claims, will be “shady billboard lawyers whose business model relies on abusing auto accident victims for their own personal gain.”\n\n“Californians deserve a system that prioritizes victims over billboard lawyers,” said Adam Blinick, Uber’s head of public policy. “Capping attorney fees, banning kickbacks, and ending inflated medical billing are common-sense reforms that will protect auto accident victims and lower costs, and we’re confident voters will agree.”\n\nUber has poured fuel on the fire with federal racketeering lawsuits targeting both Downtown LA Law Group, or DTLA, and Jacob Emrani, two prominent personal injury law offices in Southern California. The lawsuits allege the attorneys had “side agreements” with certain doctors to inflate medical bills for unnecessary procedures to get a larger payout.\n\nIn an Instagram post, DTLA called the lawsuit a “calculated attempt by a billion-dollar corporation” to suppress legitimate claims. An attorney representing Emrani called it meritless and part of a campaign “to shut the courthouse doors to victims injured by Uber drivers.”\n\nGearing up for a fight, Consumer Attorneys of California, a powerful trial lawyer trade group, is pushing three ballot measures of its own, including one seeking to increase legal liability for ride-share companies if a passenger is sexually assaulted by a driver and the other aiming to nullify the fee-capping measure if it passes. Billboards have sprung up across Los Angeles reminding Californians that Uber is the subject of a string of recent New York Times investigations into sexual assault by drivers.\n\nThe company said it has invested billions in keeping riders safe and has “done more than any other company to confront” sexual violence.\n\nConsumer Watchdog, a consumer advocacy group that sponsored some of the billboards and receives funding from trial attorneys, put out a “consumer alert” branding the fee cap as a “license to kill” measure, claiming it would ultimately pave the way for Uber to move forward with robotaxis without worrying about getting sued. Uber said this was “flat-out untrue” and the measure has nothing to do with autonomous vehicles.\n\nThe push by Uber comes at a tense point for California’s legal bar. The Times reported this fall on private investors looking to bankroll California sex abuse cases, and separate allegations of fraudulent lawsuits and unethical conduct by Downtown LA Law Group, a firm known for car crash lawsuits that played a prominent role in L.A. County’s $4-billion sex abuse settlement.\n\nDTLA has denied all wrongdoing and said it operates “with unwavering integrity, prioritizing client welfare.”\n\nSome attorneys worry about how voters will perceive their industry when it’s time to cast ballots.\n\n“I’ll tell you straight up, we could do a better job policing ourselves,” said Rowley, who said he believed the State Bar had historically been weak on California lawyers. “It creates a situation where Uber can do what it’s doing.”\n\nCalls for reform within California’s legal community have gained momentum in recent months.\n\nJoseph Nicchitta, the county’s interim chief executive officer, called on the State Bar to implement “badly needed ethical reforms” that would make big personal injury cases less profitable for lawyers. Attorney and business advocacy groups have made public pleas to keep private equity out of the state’s legal landscape, worrying it fuels frivolous lawsuits. Gov. Gavin Newsom has similarly expressed unease.\n\n“Our legal system is meant to provide justice, transparency, and accountability — not a business model that uses survivors of abuse or trauma as a revenue stream,” said a spokesperson for the governor. “California can — and must — hold two truths at the same time: standing unequivocally with survivors and victims, while also demanding integrity within the law firms and other businesses that work within our legal system.”\n\nCalifornians unhappy with problem law firms already have a way to ding them without the ballot measure, Uber’s opponents argue. A new law went into effect Jan. 1 giving private citizens the right to sue an attorney for unethical practices. Many such practices are already illegal but seldom prosecuted. That includes advertising containing false promises and using third parties to solicit clients.\n\nThe Times reported this fall that nine plaintiffs represented by Downtown LA Law Group were paid by recruiters to sue the county for sex abuse in juvenile halls, four of whom said they were told to make up claims. The firm has denied paying anyone to file lawsuits.\n\n“This is exactly why we wrote the bill,” said Sen. Tom Umberg (D-Santa Ana), a lawyer who oversees the Senate Judiciary Committee, in response to The Times’ Dec. 31 story on the firm. “I expect that someone will take it upon themselves to actually enforce that law.”",

    "fullText": "Kyrsten Sinema was heckled by two men who claimed they had affairs with the former U.S. senator after the ex-wife of her former bodyguard sued her for allegedly breaking up their marriage.\n\nThe former Arizona Senator and Utah Governor Spencer Cox were interrupted during a panel discussion on the economy, tech sector and politics Friday hosted by the Utah Chamber of Commerce and the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute, the Salt Lake City Tribune reported.\n\nSinema is graduate of Utah’s Brigham Young University, whose mascot is the cougar. “I get called that a lot,” the 49-year-old former senator from Arizona joked to the audience.\n\nMoments later, a man stood up from the crowd and declared: “Ladies and gentlemen, I have a confession to make. I am actually having an affair with Kyrsten Sinema.”\n\nThe man continued to yell as he was removed by event staff from the room. Soon after the panel got back on track, another man stood up and yelled out a similar message, the Tribune reported.\n\nThe second heckler was also grabbed by security and escorted out of the room.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the hecklers were performing a prank.\n\nNeither were cited or arrested, according to the report.\n\n“I promise I didn’t plan that,” Sinema said.\n\nThe outbursts followed a blockbuster lawsuit filed by the ex-wife of a member of Sinema’s former Senate security team, alleging that Sinema had a romantic relationship with her husband that led to the breakdown of their marriage.\n\nHeather Ammel is seeking at least $75,000 in damages from Sinema.\n\nThe complaint was initially filed in September in a North Carolina court but gained national attention after Sinema’s attorney asked to move the case to federal court last week.\n\nAmmel claimed in the filing that she and Matthew Ammel shared “a good and loving marriage” marked by “genuine love and affection” until Sinema allegedly pursued Matthew, who worked as her bodyguard.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Ammel accompanied Sinema on various trips, including to Napa Valley, Las Vegas, and Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn 2024, while Sinema was still in office, Heather Ammel reportedly uncovered “romantic and lascivious” messages exchanged between her then-husband and Sinema through Signal, an encrypted messaging app.\n\nNorth Carolina, where the lawsuit was filed, is one of a handful of states that allow spouses to sue for “alienation of affection,” allowing abandoned spouses to seek damages from a third party responsible for breaking up a marriage.\n\nThe centrist senator changed her party affiliation from Democratic to independent in 2022, though she continued to caucus with Democratic lawmakers on committee assignments.\n\nShe resigned after the 2024 election, and she ended her six-year tenure in office in January 2025.\n\nThe Independent has requested comment from an attorney for Sinema.",

    "fullText": "SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) — A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit against California that sought detailed voting records and personal data on its 23 million registered voters, concluding that the government's request was “unprecedented and illegal.”\n\nThe Trump administration's lawsuit, filed last year, contended that California and other states were illegally blocking the federal government's wide-ranging effort to scrutinize detailed voter data that states said was private and protected.\n\nThe administration “may not unilaterally usurp the authority over elections” U.S. District Judge David O. Carter in Santa Ana said in his 33-page decision.\n\nFurthermore, the attempt to gather and centralize the personal information would have a chilling effect on voter registration and threaten “the right to vote which is the cornerstone of American democracy,” the judge ruled.\n\n“There cannot be unbridled consolidation of all elections power in the executive (branch) without action from Congress,” Carter said. “This is antithetical to the promise of fair and free elections.”\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nIt has accused states of failing to respond sufficiently to questions about the procedures they take to maintain voter rolls. The department has sued 23 states, most of them controlled by Democrats, and the District of Columbia for detailed voter data that includes names, dates of birth, residential addresses, driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers.\n\nState election officials have questioned what the DOJ plans to do with that information. Last fall 10 Democratic secretaries of state wrote Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to express concern over reports that the DOJ was sharing state voter data with the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of DHS, operates a program that checks citizenship status.\n\nCalifornia Secretary of State Shirley Weber, the state's chief elections officer, said in a statement that California would “continue to challenge this administration’s disregard for the rule of law and our right to vote.”",

    "fullText": "Kyrsten Sinema divided Democrats during her time in the U.S. Senate. Now she’s accused of dividing a husband and wife, too.\n\nThe former Arizona senator is accused of having an extramarital affair with her bodyguard while in office—an alleged relationship that ultimately led to the collapse of a 14-year marriage, according to a federal lawsuit filed by the bodyguard’s ex-wife.\n\nFiled in North Carolina, the suit alleges that Sinema, 49, engaged in lengthy, sultry text exchanges with her former bodyguard, Matthew Ammel, including sending photos of herself wrapped in a towel and suggesting that he bring MDMA on a work trip so she could “guide him through a psychedelic experience.”\n\nHeather Ammel, Matthew’s ex-wife, is suing Sinema for alienation of affection, a controversial North Carolina law that allows a person to be held liable for malicious interference in a marriage.\n\nRoughly a year after Matthew joined Sinema’s security detail, the head of her security team departed and warned him that Sinema “was having sexual relations with other security members,” according to the complaint.\n\nHeather alleges that Matthew suffered from mental health challenges stemming from his service in the U.S. Army, and that Sinema exploited his vulnerability to grow closer to him—at one point promising to “help him” work through his struggles. Heather says she later discovered scores of sexually charged messages between Matthew and the prominent centrist Democrat on the encrypted messaging app Signal. Sinema announced in March 2024 that she would not seek re-election.\n\nThe lawsuit further claims that Sinema paid for Matthew’s psychedelic treatments, brought him to a wedding, and showered him with gifts: took him on international vacations, to a Taylor Swift concert, and allegedly purchased a Theragun so she could “work on his back.”\n\nIn June 2024, Sinema allegedly offered Matthew a paid staff position in her Senate office as a Defense and National Security fellow, where he worked as her subordinate.\n\nAround that time, Heather says she confronted Sinema after seeing a message on Matthew’s phone that read: “I miss you. Putting my hand on your heart. I’ll see you soon.”\n\nHeather responded directly, writing: “are you having an affair with my husband? You took a married man away from his family.”\n\n“Prior to [Sinema’s] deliberate interference in the marriage, genuine love and affection existed between [the couple],” the lawsuit states.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to Sinema’s representatives for comment. Matthew Ammel could not be reached for comment.\n\nMatthew filed for divorce earlier this month, TheAssemblyNC reported.\n\nDuring her Senate tenure, Sinema was known as a centrist Democrat whose closest relationships in Congress were often with Republicans rather than members of her own party. She frequently drew criticism from the left, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, who told Stephen Colbert, “I will not miss Senator Sinema,” after she announced she would not seek reelection.\n\nSinema, now a political adviser at D.C. law firm Hogan Lovells, cited frustration with the state of American politics as one reason for her decision, saying: “Despite modernizing our infrastructure, ensuring clean water, delivering good jobs and safer communities, Americans still choose to retreat farther to their partisan corners.” She added that compromise had become a “dirty word.”",

    "title": "Why this legal expert says the Minnesota and Illinois immigration lawsuits ‘are close to completely meritless’",
    "description": "Illinois and Minnesota sued the Trump administration over its immigration crackdown. But they have a tough road ahead of them in court, one legal analyst says.",
    "fullText": "Over the last several months, Chicago, Minneapolis and St. Paul have seen a dramatic escalation in federal immigration enforcement along their chilly streets, with agents arresting thousands – including some US citizens – in neighborhoods, shopping centers, schools and at protests.\n\nThe surge is the result of the Trump administration’s commitment to cracking down on immigration, concentrated in Democratic-led cities, and follows weeks of growing tensions between the federal government and local Midwestern officials who have long implored for an end to the operations.\n\nIllinois and Minnesota, joined by their city counterparts, are now separately pursuing legal action against the administration, filing lawsuits Monday in federal courts over immigration enforcement they call unlawful and unconstitutional.\n\nA judge decided not to issue a temporary restraining order in the Minnesota lawsuit during a status conference Wednesday morning, but said her decision “should not be considered a prejudgment.”\n\nThe lawsuit presents “somewhat frontier issues in constitutional law,” US District Judge Katherine Menendez said. A hearing has not yet been scheduled in Illinois.\n\nThe road ahead for both suits appears dim, with their likelihood for success small, one expert says.\n\nElie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor and CNN senior legal analyst, has closely followed the turmoil in Chicago and the Twin Cities. Here, he breaks down the lawsuits, their merits and what’s next in the courtrooms.\n\nSome of the answers have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nCNN: What are Illinois and Minnesota asking for from judges in their lawsuits?\n\nHonig: Fundamentally, both of these states are asking federal judges to block Immigration and Customs Enforcement from enforcing immigration law in their states and cities. There are variations between them, but that’s the core ask. As a backup, both states ask the courts for some sort of ruling or declaration that some of the tactics ICE is using are unconstitutional.\n\nCNN: What are the key differences between the lawsuits?\n\nHonig: The main difference is that Illinois asks to block all ICE activity in the state, whereas Minnesota phrases its ask as seeking to stop this “surge” of officers. But pointing to the surge is legally irrelevant, because whether you’re talking about a group of ICE agents who are already there, or who were added after some point, the fundamental ask is still the same. You’re still asking a judge to block ICE from doing its job as it sees fit in your state.\n\nCNN: What is the legal precedent for an ask like that?\n\nHonig: None. There is no example, nor does either state cite an example in their papers, of a judge prohibiting a federal law enforcement agent from enforcing federal law in a given state. The reaction that we’ve heard from various Minnesota officials, including Attorney General Keith Ellison, when confronted with this lack of precedent and lack of case law, is essentially, “Well, this is really bad, though. Well, this is an invasion.” There is plenty of dramatic language in the complaints, but that doesn’t change the legal calculus. You can’t just take a situation that has no legal precedent and no legal support and say, “Well, yes, but our situation is really, really bad, therefore we get to invent new law.”\n\nCNN: In your opinion, how strong do you think the states’ arguments are?\n\nHonig: I think the arguments that both states are making, that ICE should be blocked, either entirely or just the surge, are close to completely meritless. Fundamentally, what they’re asking for is legally completely unwarranted.\n\nCNN: What do you think is the most likely outcome for each suit?\n\nHonig: It’s so dependent on the judge here. But I think the best, realistic scenario for the states is – if they get sympathetic judges who decide to put ICE through its paces – maybe they call in ICE agents as witnesses, or ICE officials as witnesses, probe into ICE’s training, policies and tactics and issue some sort of declaration that ICE needs to do things differently or better. Some sort of window dressing like that is probably the best realistic outcome. There’s no way a judge is going to say, “I hereby block you, ICE, from carrying out enforcement activities.” And if a judge does do that, it’ll be reversed.\n\nCNN: What are the legal principles at play here on the other side?\n\nHonig: First, it’s the Supremacy Clause, which says that the state and local authorities cannot block the feds from carrying out their federal duties. And also Article Two, which gives the federal executive branch the power to enforce federal law. Those are the legal theories that really are in play here.\n\nCNN: If the states’ chances of winning are close to zero, what can be done?\n\nHonig: I’m not saying there’s nothing to be done. This is just not the way to address any abuses or excesses by ICE. If a person has his or her rights violated, if a search is unlawful, if a person is wrongly detained, if a person is injured or killed wrongly by ICE, they can sue. They can go to court and seek specific redress for their specific injuries. What the courts are not supposed to do, first of all, is prohibit the federal executive branch from carrying out federal executive branch prerogatives and, secondly, issue blanket theoretical advisory rulings about the way the world ought to look or ought not to look. Cases need to be about specific injury and specific redress, and these lawsuits are not that.\n\nCNN: Illinois and Chicago sued the Trump administration in October 2025 after it federalized and tried to deploy the Illinois National Guard, also arguing in part that it violated the 10th Amendment. The state was successful in that case and Trump has largely backed off National Guard deployment there for now. What are the key differences between that case and this one over immigration enforcement?\n\nHonig: The National Guard was an entirely different case where Trump used a specific law, Section 12406, to deploy the National Guard. The Supreme Court offered a very specific and nuanced definition of the term “regular forces,” and whether that meant regular law enforcement forces, or regular military forces. So that case was based on the action Trump took that was based on a specific federal statute, and the Supreme Court construed and defined that statute against the Trump administration. Legally, it’s a completely different scenario from what we have here.\n\nCNN: Illinois and Minnesota filed their suits Monday; the latter also filing a temporary restraining order request. What happens now?\n\nHonig: One of two things. One, the judges can just reject these out of hand. I think that’s unlikely. I think the judges are going to want to hear further from the parties. The judges might decide to hold fact-finding hearings, they might decide, “I want to dig into what ICE is doing a bit.” That’s all within the broad discretion of these district court judges. I think those are the next steps, but if a district court judge is to say, “ICE, you can’t go in there, you can’t go into that state, you can’t go into that city,” I think that will get reversed real quick.\n\nCNN: Is there a timeline we can anticipate here for how quickly the judges may act on these lawsuits?\n\nHonig: Judges are in charge of handling their own dockets and calendars. I would assume judges would understand that these are fairly immediate and emergent issues and would want to get the parties in court within days, not months.",

    "description": "The class-action lawsuit is the latest in a long line of complaints over Tesla's electronically powered door handles.",
    "fullText": "Tesla is facing more heat over its famously flush door handles.\n\nThe automaker was hit with a class-action lawsuit over door handle failures in its Model S EV on Friday, the latest in a long line of complaints over Tesla's electronically powered handles.\n\nThe class-action lawsuit was filed in Florida by John Urban, a Maitland-based Tesla owner, on behalf of those who had purchased or leased a 2014-2016 Model S.\n\nThe complaint alleges that the \"flush\" door handles on Tesla's luxury sedan, which are designed to pop out when the driver approaches, \"routinely fail\" after only a few years of use, leaving owners unable to get into the vehicle and creating a \"significant safety risk\" by potentially locking them out in emergency situations.\n\nThree out of the four door handles on Urban's 2015 Model S \"Ludicrous\" variant had failed by 2022, the complaint said, including the driver's seat door handle, forcing the Florida resident to climb over from the passenger side while he waited for repairs.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that Tesla \"knew or should have known\" about the \"defective\" handles. It pointed to the automaker redesigning the door handles on post-2016 Model S vehicles to make them more reliable, adding that more recent models rarely experience the defect.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt's the latest legal action Tesla has faced over the design of its door handles. The EV giant was among the first to pioneer electronically powered handles that sit flush against the car's surface, and this feature was a major selling point for the company's early models.\n\nHowever, multiple lawsuits have alleged that Tesla's electronic handles can become inoperable when the vehicle's low-voltage battery dies, trapping passengers inside during an emergency.\n\nIn October, the parents of two college students killed in a Cybertruck crash in California sued the company, alleging that the victims were trapped inside the burning vehicle after power to the Cybertruck's electric door failed.\n\nA month later, Tesla was sued by the family of two Wisconsin residents who died after their 2016 Model S crashed into a tree, with the lawsuit also alleging that the vehicle's door handle system failed during the crash.\n\nThe Texas-based automaker is also under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration after some Model Y owners reported that their children had been trapped inside after the door handles failed.\n\nTesla's vehicles do include manual door releases, but critics have said that these can be difficult to access during an emergency situation. Franz von Holzhausen, the company's chief designer, told Bloomberg last September that Tesla was redesigning its door handles to provide more obvious manual controls.\n\nThe issue has also drawn political scrutiny, with one US House Rep. introducing a bill last week that would force automakers to include \"easy-to-find manual releases\" on all car doors.\n\nIn a new safety page on Tesla's website added last month, the company said its vehicles' doors would automatically unlock for emergency access, but added in a footnote that certain safety features may not be available for all vehicles based on build date.",

    "description": "The plaintiffs claim the industry withheld information from the public.",
    "fullText": "Two homeowners in Washington state have filed an unprecedented lawsuit against Big Oil over skyrocketing home insurance premiums that they say are climate-related.\n\nAccording to Inside Climate News, the case was filed in late November in the U.S. District Court in the state's Western District and is the first of its kind to target dirty fuel companies over unreasonable home insurance costs.\n\nThe plaintiffs say oil companies downplayed the impacts of burning oil and gas on the climate, which has led to more frequent extreme weather events that have contributed to the insurance crisis.\n\nIn Washington, insurance premiums have risen by more than 50% since 2019. Resident Richard Kennedy, one of the homeowners involved in the lawsuit, said his premiums have more than doubled since 2017. Margaret Hazard, the other plaintiff, reported similar spikes in home insurance rates.\n\nThe class-action lawsuit they filed covers all homeowners who have or plan to buy insurance after 2017 nationwide. Homeowners insurance premiums have increased nationwide, with a January report from the Department of the Treasury showing that average premiums rose 9% faster than overall inflation from 2018 to 2022.\n\nAccording to Program Business, many homeowners near dense forests are experiencing reduced or severely limited coverage, particularly in wildfire-prone areas. A 2016 report by Climate Central found that the number of large fires burning annually has increased fivefold in Washington since the 1970s.\n\nUnfortunately, the insurance industry is trying to play catch-up because existing risk models have tended to underestimate impacts, leaving homeowners vulnerable and underinsured. Meanwhile, studies have found that the oil and gas industry has known the devastating impacts of its activities on the climate since the 1970s.\n\nBut with more states, cities, and even individuals suing oil companies to hold them accountable for the destruction brought by climate change, the tides might finally be turning.\n\nThe Washington lawsuit, Kennedy v. Exxon et al., involves both federal and state law claims, including violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, fraudulent misrepresentation, and civil conspiracy.\n\nThe plaintiffs say the industry withheld information from the public and engaged in greenwashing by portraying oil and gas as climate-friendly without taking adequate steps to protect the environment. The suit names major oil companies, including Exxon, Shell, BP, and Chevron, and alleges that the defendants have earned over $2 trillion in profits since 1990.\n\nShould the government be paying us to upgrade our homes?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nWith natural disasters increasing in frequency and severity over the past decade, insurance companies have had to raise premiums to cover massive losses driven by climate-related events such as hurricanes, wildfires, and floods.\n\nAccording to Hagens Berman, the law firm representing Kennedy and Hazard, the costs of natural catastrophes have far exceeded the ability of homeowners and insurers to pay in recent years.\n\n\"Higher insurance premiums are the result of the fossil fuel industry's decades-long campaign of disinformation to obstruct climate action,\" U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse told Inside Climate News in an emailed statement.\n\n\"We are already seeing signs of the Great Climate Insurance Collapse, which will cascade into a collapse in property values that will trash our entire economy. Just like Big Tobacco, Big Oil has lied for decades to the American people about the full extent of the harms of its products and must be held accountable.\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "title": "He Filed a Permit for an Addition to His Home, Then the City Requested Half His Front Yard",
    "description": "A Miami homeowner says the city wouldn’t approve his permit unless he gave up part of his yard. A new lawsuit says he's one of hundreds.",
    "fullText": "Chad Trausch just wanted to build a small addition to his Miami home. With a baby on the way, he and his wife were making space for her parents to move in and help with child care. But when he submitted the plans, the city hit him with a condition he never expected: If he wanted a permit to build in the backyard, he’d first need to grant the public the right to use half his front yard.\n\nThe city requested that Trausch record a deed dedicating a 10-by-50-foot strip of his property for public use at his own expense. Such a condition would have allowed the city to treat the land as its own for sidewalks, street widening, or utilities, without paying him for it.\n\nIt wasn’t a case of eminent domain: There was no compensation, no formal taking. Just a response to a standard permit application.\n\n“They said in no uncertain terms, if you don't give up this land, you don't get your permit,” Trausch tells Realtor.com®.\n\nWhen Trausch refused, his addition stalled, costing him thousands of dollars in added expenses. But the deeper he dug, it became clear that he was far from alone. With legal help from the Institute for Justice, Trausch uncovered a practice that may affect more than 1,000 homeowners across Miami—one that, according to a new lawsuit, pressures residents to grant public right of way to their land through permits without any public use plan or payment.\n\nBehind the city’s request was a claim that it needed the 500-square-foot patch for a future right-of-way expansion.\n\nThe public right of way is the legal right for the public to use a specific strip of land, even if it’s privately owned. It’s the doctrine that makes sidewalks and utilities possible. In Miami, public right of way is established at 25 feet, according to local code. That means, when measured from the center of the street, there should be a 25-foot radius that is reserved for public use, Suranjan Sen, an attorney with the IJ, explains.\n\nCurrently, in the Trausches' neighborhood, that 25-foot radius lines up almost perfectly with where the sidewalk ends and their front yard begins, says Sen. But the building setback line (also called the base building line)—the area of a property where construction is prohibited—extends to 35 feet from the center of the street, creating a 10-foot gap between the edge of the public right-of-way and where building is allowed to begin.\n\nThe city said it needed the land to match future development plans, but Trausch’s team says that doesn’t mean the property should be up for grabs.\n\n“Chad owns it. He can exclude people from it. He can have his fence there, but he's just not allowed to build right up there,” says Sen.\n\nTo complicate matters further, the city had no formal plan for expansion, and didn’t offer the Trausches compensation. Worse, Trausch says, the city wanted him to pay to record the deed transfer himself.\n\n“They're asking us to pay that out of pocket, then hand [it to] them for free. … They said that's just how it's always been done,” he says.\n\nBut Trausch, a Navy veteran, wasn’t having it. Instead, he represented himself in court and fought the city for over a year at enormous personal expense. In that time, inflation and rising construction costs drove up his renovation budget by an estimated $200,000.\n\nEven more damaging, the standoff forced Trausch's wife and newborn to temporarily move out of state for child care support. Trausch stayed behind to manage the house, his job, and the lawsuit.\n\n“It's really hurt our family,” he says.\n\nUnlike a formal eminent domain proceeding, where the government must prove public use and pay compensation, the city of Miami has allegedly developed an “unwritten rule” that sidesteps that process entirely.\n\nIf a homeowner applies for a permit and their building setback or base line extends beyond the public right of way line, the city requests the difference.\n\nSen says in a deposition for the IJ’s suit that the director of Miami Public Works testified that “their policy is an unwritten rule that if you need a land use permit, and if the base building line on your property is beyond the currently established public right of way, then they'll just mechanically demand it as a condition of your permit.”\n\nThat process violates long-established legal doctrine, according to the team at the IJ.\n\n“Cities should be going through eminent domain for these kinds of things,” Sen says. But, he adds, “I'm not sure that they'd even be able to take this land through eminent domain, and the reason is, they don't have any particular plan for it.”\n\nIn a proper taking, the government must justify its need, show how the land will be used, that it's reasonably necessary for the public use, and then pay fair market value for what it takes.\n\nBut no plan has been presented.\n\n“There's no plan for that land at all,” Trausch says.\n\nThe Trausches' case may be far from unique.\n\n“We've heard from architects, contractors, lawyers in Miami that they do this all the time to people in Miami, and it's just it's run as a matter of routine, and so people don't really fight back,” Trausch says.\n\nOne clue to the practice may lie in the city’s own maps.\n\n“If you look at Miami's GIS maps of property lines, you can actually see where it will zigzag,\" says Sen. \"I think one can infer that every time it zigzags like that, that represents that parcel has been forced to give up their front yard.\"\n\nIn court filings, the plaintiffs cite sworn testimony from Miami’s public works director, who stated that the city has subjected hundreds of homeowners to this requirement.\n\nYet so far, there’s been no official move to end the practice.\n\nThe legal team representing the Trausches argue that what’s happening in Miami amounts to an unconstitutional end-run around the rules of eminent domain.\n\n“We also said, if you want to eminent domain this, you can do that, but you have to compensate us,\" Trausch says.\n\nBut, he adds, \"They said, no, this isn't eminent domain. We're not compensating you anything. In fact, you have to self-finance this handover of land to us.”\n\nMost homeowners, Trausch says, don’t fight back because the value of the project they’re trying to complete often outweighs the value of the land the city wants for public right of way.\n\n“The value of me doing my project and building a home for my family will be way more, in most cases, than the land,\" he says. \"So they count on most people just giving up.”\n\nWhen the Institute for Justice entered the case, the city quickly backed off its demand—at least for the Trausches. “As soon as IJ filed their notice of appearance in court, two weeks later, the city said, OK, we're gonna waive that condition.”\n\nTo Trausch, the timing sent a message. “It's kind of insulting, right? Because it means they were just happy to fight me and stonewall me. But as soon as some real lawyers showed up, they tried to make it go away.”\n\nEven then, Trausch says the city made clear that the waiver was temporary. “They said they reserve the right to ask for this land and demand it again.”\n\nThat means that any new permit—for a new roof, future addition, or other necessary upgrade for a historic house built in the 1930s—could trigger a taking. That’s why he and the IJ are pressing forward with their case. They want the court to declare the practice illegal and block the city from using it in the future. They’re also seeking damages for the costs of the delay, now estimated at several hundred thousand dollars.\n\nBeyond the legal questions, Trausch says the case raises a deeper issue about fairness and trust. “We like living in Miami, we believe in the community, we want to put down roots here, and, we expect them to follow the same rules they expect us to follow.”\n\nThat's why it's about more than just a 500-square-foot strip of land, his attorneys argue.\n\n“People don’t realize how important land use law is to our daily lives,\" Sen says. At the heart of the case, he argues, is a basic constitutional promise. “People have a right to use their property, and people have a right not to have their property taken from them without just compensation.”",

    "fullText": "On Jan. 7, the U.S. Supreme Court deferred ruling on the litigation challenging President Donald Trump's global tariffs\n\nThe new date for the next ruling is set for Jan. 14.\n\nWhen Trump announced sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs targeting countries across the world on Apr. 2, 2025, a day he dubbed \"Liberation Day,\" he invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).\n\nThe administration had argued that trade deficits constituted a national emergency and the president didn't need to consult with Congress to levy global tariffs.\n\nSeveral businesses affected by the decision and 12 U.S. states, mostly Democratic-governed, then went to the Supreme Court to challenge Trump's tariffs.\n\nIf the court rules that the president was wrong in invoking the emergency powers, the Trump administration will have to reimburse importers who already have paid the duties. The reimbursement is estimated to be more than $133.5 billion as per a Reuters report.\n\nBut the administration could get away with only limited repayments if the court decides to grant limited powers to the president under IEEPA.\n\nThe court's decision carries far-reaching implications for not only the global economy but also the crypto market.\n\nThe digital assets market got increasingly tied to Wall Street last year and Trump's tariff announcements frequently rattled the markets throughout 2025.\n\nIn fact, it was Trump's threat to hike tariffs on China on Oct. 10 last year that triggered the crypto flash crash in which more than $19 billion got wiped out in a day.\n\nWealthy trader moves millions ahead of Trump’s ‘big’ economic speech\n\nMysterious trader bets millions ahead of the Fed’s big announcement\n\nMysterious traders are selling ahead of Trump's 9PM address to the nation\n\nAhead of key policy announcements, mysterious crypto traders often place market orders and net millions of dollars.\n\nAs reported earlier, a trader made millions by shorting cryptocurrencies ahead of Trump's China announcement on Oct. 10.\n\nRecently, a crypto trader on Polymarket profited over $400,000 by betting on Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro's ouster.\n\nNotably, the trader had created his Polymarket account only a day earlier, triggering speculations of insider trading.\n\nOnce again, a crypto whale placed an order as markets buzzed with reports of a Supreme Court ruling expected on Jan. 9.",

Aguilera ended up at an apartment where she was supposed to spend the night. Ultimately, she fell to her death around midnight.\n\n“We believe even more today this was not a suicide as has been suggested by police.

    "description": "Nearly four years after the lawsuit was first filed, a key threshold question is moving toward a final answer.",
    "fullText": "Nearly four years after the lawsuit was first filed, a key threshold question is moving toward a final answer.\n\nThe NFL has filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court as to the question of whether the civil action filed in February 2022 by former Dolphins coach (and current Vikings defensive coordinator) Brian Flores against the NFL, the Dolphins, the Giants, the Broncos, and the Texans will be resolved in court, or in arbitration.\n\nThe specific legal question presented to the Supreme Court is this: \"Whether an arbitration agreement governing disputes in a professional sports league is categorically unenforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act because it designates the league commissioner as the default arbitrator and permits the commissioner to develop arbitral procedures.\"\n\nThe NFL has wisely narrowed the question, given that the reasoning (if applied throughout corporate America) would empower other companies to attempt to rig the in-house arbitration process by putting employment disputes in the hands of the CEO. Still, the league's position is clear — it wants the Commissioner to retain power over disputes involving the NFL and the various teams that have hired and that handsomely compensate the Commissioner.\n\nThe 25-page document is the first step in an effort to persuade the Supreme Court to take up the case. Of the many petitions it receives each year, few are accepted.\n\nMore time will pass as the Supreme Court considers whether to take the case. Even more time will pass if the Supreme Court grants the petition.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit invalidated the NFL's arbitration provision, concluding that the procedure lacks independence. (And it does.) The Supreme Court, if it takes the case, will decide once and for all whether it's legitimate for the NFL (and any sports league) to put its Commissioner in charge of claims made against the NFL.\n\nIt's fundamentally unfair to delegate those powers to someone whose connection to one side of a legal fight is so obvious. Frankly, no Commissioner should want to be expected to set aside their clear self-interests in an effort to dispense justice in an objective way.\n\nBut this has been the league's practice, for years. It desperately wants to run its own business. It desperately hopes to hold the gavel when it comes to deciding whether the legal claims against it are valid.\n\nIt's a bad way to do business. It's now for the Supreme Court to decide whether it's a good way, or a bad way, to apply the laws of the United States.",

    "fullText": "Judge says there is plenty of evidence to suggest OpenAI’s leaders made assurances nonprofit structure would be kept\n\nElon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI is to go to trial after a US judge said there is plenty of evidence to support the billionaire’s case.\n\nThe world’s richest man, who co-founded OpenAI, is suing the ChatGPT developer and its chief executive, Sam Altman, over claims its leaders violated the organisation’s founding mission by shifting to a for-profit model.\n\nThe US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, told a hearing there was plenty of evidence that suggested OpenAI’s leaders made assurances that its original nonprofit structure was going to be maintained.\n\nShe said there were enough disputed facts to let a jury consider the claims at a trial scheduled for March, rather than decide the issues herself. Rogers said she would issue a written order after the hearing that addresses OpenAI’s attempt to throw out the case.\n\nThe court dispute comes amid a broader showdown over dominance in the market for generative artificial intelligence. Musk’s xAI and its chatbot Grok are competing with OpenAI and other technology developers.\n\nMusk is seeking unspecified monetary damages from what he calls “ill-gotten gains” by OpenAI.\n\nIn a statement after the hearing, OpenAI said: “Mr Musk’s lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial.”\n\nMusk’s startup xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSteven Molo, a lead trial attorney for the billionaire and xAI, said after the hearing: “We look forward to presenting all the evidence of the defendants’ wrongdoing to the jury.”\n\nMusk contends he contributed about $38m (£28m), roughly 60% of OpenAI’s early funding, along with strategic guidance and credibility, based on assurances that the organisation would remain a nonprofit dedicated to the public benefit.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses OpenAI co-founders Altman and Greg Brockman of plotting a for-profit switch to enrich themselves, culminating in multibillion-dollar deals with Microsoft and a recent restructuring.\n\nOpenAI, Altman and Brockman have denied the claims, and have described Musk as “a frustrated commercial competitor seeking to slow down a mission-driven market leader”.\n\nMicrosoft, which is also a defendant, urged Rogers to throw out Musk’s claims against it. A lawyer for Microsoft said there was no evidence that the company “aided and abetted” OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft has been approached for comment.\n\nLawyers for OpenAI at the hearing asked Rogers to enter judgment against Musk, contending that he had not shown enough of a factual basis to sustain his allegations including fraud and breach of contract.\n\nOpenAI also contends that Musk failed to bring his allegations in a timely manner. The judge said the jury would be asked to weigh whether the lawsuit was filed outside the statute of limitations.",

    "description": "Warner Bros. Discovery rejects Paramount Skydance's leveraged buyout bid again, citing financial and litigation risk",
    "fullText": "Warner Bros. Discovery's board raised its hackles on Wednesday while rejecting Paramount Skydance's bid for the eighth time in favor of Netflix's offer.\n\nWBD used pointed language, calling Paramount's bid the \"largest leveraged buyout in history by a wide margin\" and tying its potential failure to previous big LBOs that didn't close on the initially agreed-upon terms.\n\nIn its new filing, WBD also described Paramount's financial condition as \"not strong,\" noting that its credit was already rated \"junk\" by S&P before the \"extraordinary amount of debt financing\" required by the deal. Paramount, for its part, has emphasized that $40.4 billion in equity of its new bid is fully backstopped by Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison.\n\nWBD's strong language suggests that the board and leadership \"just want to move on,\" and the \"largest LBO\" angle is a new and compelling one, Wharton M&A professor Paul Nary said on X.\n\nDavid Zaslav-led WBD also ramped up its accusations that Paramount has acted litigiously and leaked to the press.\n\nIn the filing, WBD cited new press reports in the New York Post indicating Paramount was considering abandoning its offer and might pursue \"DefCon 1\" litigation against WBD's board. WBD said that Paramount didn't deny the reports, suggesting that the company was leaking to the press. WBD had previously complained that there had been \"extensive media leaks and rumors\" about Paramount's proposals.\n\nM&A experts said the stepped-up language was likely drafted in anticipation of a lawsuit against WBD, either by Paramount or WBD shareholders.\n\nNow that Paramount has lost to Netflix, \"it is likely to attempt to seek legal remedy such as a shareholder derivative suit or potentially a direct lawsuit,\" said Raul Gastesi, a partner at Gastesi Lopez Mestre & Cobiella.\n\nCorey Martin, managing partner of Granderson Des Rochers, a law firm focused on entertainment and media, said the new filing felt calibrated to deter WBD shareholders from backing Paramount's hostile bid.\n\n\"The audience is really the shareholders, because there's always the risk of shareholder lawsuits,\" Martin said. \"It is colorful stuff, but Paramount's is a hostile bid.\"\n\nMartin also saw the emphasis on legal and press tactics as part of a PR strategy to portray Paramount as a bad actor, as well as a pre-litigation tactic.\n\nLightShed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield wrote in a note on Wednesday that Paramount could still outbid Netflix, but it would \"require an overhaul of their current bid, and a dramatic increase in the cash invested from the Ellison family and/or their friends and financing partners.\"",

    "description": "An Oakland federal court judge just paved the way for a Musk-Altman showdown, rejecting OpenAI's efforts to end the case ahead of trial.",
    "fullText": "It looks like Sam Altman and Elon Musk are headed for a courtroom showdown.\n\nDuring a hearing on Wednesday, a California judge said she plans to reject Altman's lawyers' last-ditch efforts to end Musk's case against OpenAI and its CEO.\n\n\"This case is going to trial,\" US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said at a hearing to consider whether the evidence was sufficient to warrant a jury trial.\n\n\"I think there's plenty of evidence,\" she said, referring to Musk's case. \"It's circumstantial, but that's how these things work.\"\n\nIn his lawsuit filed in 2024, Musk accused OpenAI of misleading him in its decision to abandon its original nonprofit mission and structure in favor of a profit-oriented model, including through its partnership with Microsoft.\n\nMusk says he donated $38 million to the maker of ChatGPT over the years to support its mission to develop AI for the benefit of humankind. The Tesla CEO is seeking monetary damages, as well as a judgment to void Microsoft's licensing agreement with OpenAI.\n\nAt a hearing on Wednesday, an Oakland federal court judge said she felt there was enough evidence that Musk may have been deceived to allow the case to move forward to a jury. A trial is scheduled for March.\n\n\"There were assurances made, and promises made, that the structure would be maintained,\" she said. \"There was lots of information that was not shared.\"\n\nThe judge added that she also felt \"there are strong arguments by the defense.\"\n\n\"I think the jury is going to get to decide,\" she said.\n\nOpenAI lawyers have denied Musk's allegations, saying Musk was aware of the company's for-profit plans as early as 2018. OpenAI has also pointed out that it is still controlled by OpenAI's nonprofit arm.\n\n\"Mr Musk's lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial,\" a spokesperson for OpenAI told Business Insider. \"We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best resourced nonprofits ever.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMusk has filed multiple lawsuits against OpenAI. Most recently, his AI company, xAI, sued OpenAI in September, accusing it of stealing trade secrets and targeting its employees for recruitment. At the time, an OpenAI spokesperson told Business that the lawsuit is \"the latest chapter in Mr. Musk's ongoing harassment.\"\n\nMusk helped found OpenAI in 2015, but left the company in 2018. At the time he said his work with OpenAI could present a conflict of interest with Tesla's AI ambitions.\n\nSince, Musk has repeatedly criticized Altman and OpenAI, including the company's structure. Musk later went on to launch his own AI company, xAI, in 2023.",

    "description": "Natalie Gialenes sued the city of Austin and ex-officer Joseph Spees, alleging a brutal takedown and traumatic brain injury during a 2024 arrest. Spees was fired over the incident last month.",
    "fullText": "The woman a former Austin police officer slammed to the ground during a 2024 arrest has filed a federal lawsuit against the officer and the City of Austin, alleging the incident amounted to “indefensible police brutality” and left her with a traumatic brain injury.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Monday, comes weeks after Austin Police Chief Lisa Davis indefinitely suspended — effectively firing — Officer Joseph Spees over his conduct during the arrest of Natalie Gialenes, who was visiting Austin from out of state.\n\nIn her complaint, Gialenes alleges she was standing outside her hotel on East Cesar Chavez Street during the early morning hours of Dec. 7, 2024, when Spees arrested her for public intoxication, a Class C misdemeanor punishable by a fine. According to the suit, Gialenes voluntarily placed her hands behind her back and did not resist being handcuffed.\n\nAs Spees escorted her toward his patrol car, Gialenes dropped her identification card on the ground and bent down to retrieve it, the lawsuit states. At that point, Spees abruptly used force, slamming her to the pavement.\n\n\"Rather than tell Ms. Gialenes to stop or stand up straight, allow her to pick up her identification off the ground, or use any de-escalation tactics of any kind whatsoever, Officer Spees grabbed the young woman by her upper arm without warning, lifted up on her arm to raise her up slung her around his body in almost a complete circle, and threw her to the ground,\" the complaint alleges.\n\nBecause her hands were cuffed behind her back, Gialenes was unable to break her fall and struck her head on the pavement, according to the lawsuit. She bled heavily and was later hospitalized with a traumatic brain injury, along with injuries to her face, chest and feet. The suit further alleges that Spees later shoved her head-first into the back seat of his patrol car, causing her to strike her head a second time, even as blood pooled on the ground in the hotel driveway.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning the city had not been served with the lawsuit, according to spokesperson Erik Johnson, who said in a prepared statement that officials would \"review it and respond appropriately.\" Austin Police Association President Michael Bullock, who often weighs in on personnel matters, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe incident was first made public last month when Davis released a 14-page disciplinary memo explaining her decision to indefinitely suspend Spees, who had worked for the department for 11 years. In the memo, Davis wrote that “any objectively reasonable officer — and especially an experienced and well-trained officer like Officer Spees — should have been able to handle minimal resistance without immediately resorting to a violent takedown that caused considerable injury.”\n\nAccording to the disciplinary memo, Spees told internal affairs investigators that one of Gialenes' hands slipped out of the handcuffs the officer placed her in, which represented a severe threat.\n\nBut Davis described the claims as dubious. \"I do not believe that any objectively reasonable officer could share Officer Spees' judgment that [Gialenes] posed a level 8 out of 10 threat while she was handcuffed and he was escorting her to his patrol car,\" the chief wrote in her memo.\n\nGialenes is represented by Austin civil rights attorney Jeff Edwards, who said in a news release that the incident reflects a broader pattern of excessive force within the department. As a result of Spees’ actions, Edwards said, Gialenes “suffered a painful and serious brain injury that will impact her for the rest of her life.”\n\n\"APD must do more than terminate the officer – it must acknowledge the department’s systematic wrongdoing, revamp its disciplinary system, and change its training immediately, or more people will continue to be senselessly injured by APD officers,\" Edwards said.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to include comment from the city of Austin",

    "description": "In 2025, a lawsuit was filed against The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, alleging that its negligence led to serious bodily injury to a minor. This week, the Church filed a response to the lawsuit, denying the allegations.",
    "fullText": "Editor’s Note: A lawsuit only portrays one side of a story.\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (ABC4) — In 2025, a lawsuit was filed against The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, alleging that its negligence led to serious bodily injury to a minor. This week, the Church filed a response to the lawsuit, denying the allegations.\n\nIn November 2025, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of two minors, who have not been identified due to their age, after one of the minors had sustained serious injuries during a church activity in 2022. At the time of the incident, the minors were 12 and 14 years old.\n\nA court-appointed conservator was assigned as the plaintiff on behalf of the two minor children. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was named as the defendant.\n\nThe juveniles were participating in an activity on a boat owned by their ward’s Young Women leader, according to the lawsuit. While on the boat, the 12-year-old was feeding out a rope to an inner tube when the young women’s leader reportedly accelerated.\n\nDue to the acceleration, the rope wrapped around the boy’s left foot and severed it below the ankle.\n\nThe Young Women’s leader reportedly turned the boat off but was unable to restart it because the engine flooded. The 12-year-old’s brother, who was 14 at the time and is the other minor involved in the lawsuit, called 911.\n\nThe brother had to apply a tourniquet to the injured leg and, with the help of others, attempted to paddle his brother to shore on the inner tube.\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE: Negligence lawsuit filed against Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints after child loses foot\n\nDespite additional medical attention, the 12-year-old’s foot could not be saved after undergoing two amputations. He also had to go through multiple surgeries.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the minor has sustained significant mental, emotional, and psychological trauma in addition to irreparable and life-altering harm. It also alleges that his brother sustained emotional and psychological injuries due to witnessing the incident and its impact on his brother.\n\nBecause it was a Church activity supervised by Church leaders, the plaintiffs argue that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had a responsibility and duty to the minors and breached that duty by failing to provide a safe environment and failing to properly train supervisory individuals.\n\nThe plaintiffs are asking for compensation to help both minors with medical treatment and emotional recovery, as well as for any loss of future and past enjoyment of life.\n\nOn Monday, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints filed a response to the initial lawsuit. While it admitted that some of its youth activities involve water sports and that the driver of the boat is in charge of some youth activities, it denied that it breached any of its obligations or legal responsibilities.\n\nThe Church also admitted that the adults who organized the activity were leaders within the church. However, they denied that the Young Women’s leader had increased the dangers of boating or that any injuries sustained were the result of acts, errors, or omissions by the Church.\n\nBased on Wyoming law’s due care requirements, the Church admitted it owed a duty of care to the minors but denied allegations that it breached that duty.\n\nHow to make ABC4 your preferred news source on Google\n\nIn its response, the Church argued that it bears no responsibility and that there are inherent risks of activities like watersports that it cannot prevent. It also argued that the plaintiff’s claims were barred by the volunteer immunity doctrine, which provides certain protections to individuals acting as volunteers.\n\nThe response reads, in part, “the injuries are the result of a rare and unforeseen accident that happened in the absence of negligence or lack of due care by the Defendant.”\n\nIt also says that the Church “prays plaintiff take nothing by way of the complaint” and asks the court to grant the defendant any relief that the court deems equitable.\n\nABC4 has reached out to the Church for a statement on the lawsuit and has not yet heard back.\n\nBig air, moguls, slopestyle: What to know about freestyle skiing at Winter Olympics\n\nShort track speedskating at the Winter Olympics: Here’s what to know\n\nUS star Pulisic having career year at AC Milan ahead of 2026 World Cup\n\nTunisia changes coach before World Cup after disappointing Africa Cup\n\nWorld Cup qualification shines as new objective for Congo after Africa Cup",

    "fullText": "Jan. 6 (UPI) -- NASCAR commissioner Steve Phelps will resign at the end of January, he announced Tuesday.\n\nHis departure comes amid fallout from an antitrust lawsuit, which revealed disparaging messages he sent during revenue-sharing negotiations.\n\nPhelps, 63, joined NASCAR in 2005 as vice president of corporate marketing and later served as chief marketing officer, senior vice president, executive vice president, chief operating officer and president. He was promoted to commissioner in March.\n\n\"As a lifelong race fan, it gives me immense pride to have served as NASCAR's first commissioner and to lead our great sport through so many incredible challenges, opportunities and firsts over my 20 years,\" Phelps said in a news release. \"Our sport is built on the passion of our fans, the dedication of our teams and partners, and the commitment of our wonderful employees.\n\n\"It has been an honor to help synthesize the enthusiasm of long-standing NASCAR stakeholders with that of new entrants to our ecosystem, such as media partners, auto manufacturers, track operators and incredible racing talent.\n\nFront Row Motorsports and 23XI Racing, owned by basketball legend Michael Jordan and NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin, sued NASCAR in federal antitrust case.\n\nThe discovery process during that lawsuit revealed several disparaging remarks through message sent from Phelps, with the commissioner calling NASCAR legend and team owner Richard Childress a \"stupid redneck\" in once instance. Phelps apologized to Childress during the trial, but his remarks drew harsh criticism from those connected to the sport.\n\nNACAR reached a settlement with the teams in December.\n\nThe racing league did not announce additional leadership or personnel changes and said Phelps' departure \"comes during a time of stability with an exceptional leadership team in place.\"\n\n\"Steve will forever be remembered as one of NASCAR's most impactful leaders,\" NASCAR chairman and CEO Jim France said. \"For decades he has worked tirelessly to thrill fans, support teams and execute a vision for the sport that has treated us all to some of the greatest moments in our nearly 80-year history.\n\n\"It's been an honor to work alongside him in achieving the impossible like being the first sport to return during COVID or in delivering the unimaginable by launching new races in the LA Memorial Coliseum and NASCAR's first-ever street race in downtown Chicago. Steve leaves NASCAR with a transformative legacy of innovation and collaboration with an unrelenting growth mindset.\"\n\nThe 2026 NASCAR Cup Series season will start with the Cook Out Clash at Bowman Gray Stadium on Feb. 1 in Winston-Salem, N.C. The 2026 Daytona 500 will be held Feb. 15 in Daytona Beach, Fla.",

    "fullText": "The captain of the Alaska Airlines plane that lost a panel midflight is suing Boeing, accusing it of trying to \"scapegoat\" the pilots.\n\nAttorneys for Brandon Fisher filed the lawsuit last Tuesday in an Oregon court, asking for $10 million in damages.\n\nBack in January 2024, Flight 1282 took off from Portland, bound for Ontario, California.\n\nBut at 16,000 feet, the Boeing 737 Max lost a door plug — a panel that covers a deactivated emergency exit.\n\nThe pilots declared an emergency and descended below 10,000 feet, so there was enough oxygen to breathe normally.\n\n\"But for Captain Fisher's heroism and immense display of composure under pressure, the outcome would have been catastrophic,\" the lawsuit said.\n\n\"Instead, Captain Fisher and First Officer [Emily] Wiprud executed a safe emergency landing despite chaotic conditions in the cockpit caused by the gaping hole in the left side of the aircraft.\"\n\nAn investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board later found that the plane had left Boeing's factory missing key bolts that would've secured the door plug.\n\nIt said that the fuselage arrived from the supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, with damaged rivets. Boeing workers removed the plug to repair them, but didn't put the bolts back in place, the NTSB found. This work wasn't properly documented, which also meant that there was no inspection that could've spotted the missing bolts, it said.\n\nSpirit AeroSystems is also named as a defendant in Fisher's suit. Boeing completed its acquisition of most of Spirit in December, with the aim of integrating its operations to gain greater control over its supply chain.\n\nFisher's suit said that, while defending a class-action lawsuit related to the incident, Boeing denied liability, saying its products were \"improperly maintained or misused by persons and/or entities other than Boeing.\"\n\n\"It was clear Boeing's words were directed at Captain Fisher in attempt to paint him as the scapegoat for Boeing's numerous failures,\" it said.\n\nThe suit says that Fisher suffered emotional distress as a result. \"Boeing's comments dramatically exacerbated the life-changing impacts that this incident caused Captain Fisher,\" it added.\n\nIn an internal memo, viewed by Business Insider, which was sent around shortly after the incident, the then-CEO of Boeing's commercial airplanes division, Stan Deal, told employees: \"We commend the pilots and cabin crew of Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 for their actions to safely land the plane.\"\n\nBoeing declined to comment when reached by Business Insider, citing the fact that the suit is pending litigation.\n\nAn Alaska Airlines spokesperson said, \"We have no comment on the lawsuit but remain grateful to our crewmembers for the bravery and quick thinking that they displayed on Flight 1282 in ensuring the safety of all on board.\"\n\nCorrection: January 6, 2025 — This post's headline has been amended. Brandon Fisher's lawsuit is against Boeing, not Alaska Airlines.",

    "description": "A former staffer on \"Inside Edition\" claims he was fired after complaining about bias and misconduct. CBS denied his claims.",
    "fullText": "A former producer for the syndicated CBS news program \"Inside Edition\" has sued Paramount Global, claiming he was fired after complaining about repeated antisemitic comments by senior talent.\n\nJoshua Bernstein said Lisa Guerrero, then a correspondent on the program, called him a \"whiny Jew,\" \"spoiled Jew,\" and an \"old Jewish woman\" and asked how he could have married a Muslim woman or worked for a \"terrorist network\" like Al Jazeera.\n\nShe also called him homophobic slurs and made \"countless other racist and offensive comments\" about interview subjects and coworkers, Bernstein claimed in the lawsuit, which was filed earlier this month.\n\nA publicist for Guerrero, who left \"Inside Edition\" over the summer, shared a statement from CBS Media Ventures that referred to Bernstein's claims as unsubstantiated.\n\nBernstein also claimed that Charles Lachman, the show's executive producer, was known as a \"total homophobe\" and showed bias against Black people and Muslims. According to Bernstein's lawsuit, after Bernstein showed footage of an interview with a female graduate student wearing a hijab, Lachman said, \"Absolutely not! It looks like she's about to set off a bomb.\"\n\n\"On another occasion, plaintiff witnessed Mr. Lachman screaming at a female producer stating 'No! No! No! I don't want to see fat and ugly Kelly Clarkson! I want to see Kelly Clarkson in a short skirt!'\" lawyers for Bernstein wrote in the complaint.\n\nA representative for CBS Media Ventures, the Paramount Global unit that syndicates \"Inside Edition\" and other shows like \"Jeopardy!,\" denied Bernstein's claims.\n\n\"We are committed to a safe and respectful workplace for all,\" the representative wrote in an email. \"After receiving the initial claim letter, outside counsel immediately conducted an investigation, which found no evidence to support these allegations. We will address the matter in court and are committed to vigorously defending against any fabricated claims.\"\n\n\"Inside Edition\" is a tabloid-style syndicated news program that has been running since 1989, focusing on true crime and celebrity coverage, and is a top ratings-getter for CBS Media Ventures, with more than 3 million weekly viewers, according to Nielsen.\n\nCBS Media Ventures is distinct from CBS News, where Bari Weiss was recently named editor-in-chief.\n\nLachman has been its executive producer since the late 1990s, and longtime anchor Deborah Norville left the program last year, replaced by Eva Pilgrim. Bernstein's complaint said he worked there starting in 2019, that he had a medical episode in 2023, and that he was fired about a year later while on leave.\n\nBernstein's lawsuit also claims \"Inside Edition\" engaged in \"deliberate news distortion,\" including by rigging devices to burn and explode so that segments about fireworks, e-bike batteries, and gas grills made those devices appear more dangerous than they were. He claimed that after he learned an e-bike battery had been rigged to explode, senior investigative producer Charlie McLravy told him to \"keep [his] mouth shut and don't say anything to the lawyers.\"\n\nLachman and McLravy didn't reply to comment requests.",

    "fullText": "No one does fast food quite like McDonald’s. After all, that signature smell of fresh french fries wafting through the car after a trip to the drive through is hard to compare to anything else. Whether you’re going for a burger, nuggets or even just a sip of their crispy Coke, you can’t really go wrong with the fast food giant—unless you’re ordering the McRib. In December, a lawsuit was filed against McDonald’s by four individuals who claim the restaurant has been lying to customers regarding the meat that makes up this menu item. Here, read all there is to know about the McDonald’s class-action lawsuit.\n\nWhen you hear the name “McRib,” it’s fair to assume that what you’re consuming is going to be rib meat—but according to the plaintiffs behind this lawsuit, McDonald’s has been deceiving its customers. “Despite its name and distinctive shape—its meat patty has been deliberately crafted to resemble a rack of pork ribs—the McRib does not contain any actual pork rib meat at all,” claims the lawsuit. “Instead, its meat patty is reconstructed using ground-up portions of lower-grade pork products such as inter alia, pork shoulder, heart, tripe and scalded stomach.”\n\nWhile the sandwich is called the McRib, the McDonald’s website doesn't explicitly say the menu item contains rib meat. Instead, among the ingredients listed for the McRib is a McRib Pork Patty, alongside McRib sauce, pickles and onions on a homestyle bun. “The McRib starts with seasoned boneless pork dipped in a tangy BBQ sauce, topped with slivered onions and tangy pickles, all served on a toasted homestyle bun,” states their website.\n\nThe individuals behind the lawsuit argue that including the word “rib” in the item’s name indicates that the sandwich consists of “at least some meaningful quantity of actual pork rib meat.”\n\nThe current McDonald’s class-action McRib lawsuit  is not the first lawsuit the fast food giant has dealt with, but they recently responded to the claims at hand. “This lawsuit distorts the facts and many of the claims are inaccurate,” they told NBC Chicago. \"Food quality and safety are at the heart of everything we do—that’s why we’re committed to using real, quality ingredients across our entire menu. Our fan-favorite McRib sandwich is made with 100% pork sourced from farmers and suppliers across the US. We’ve always been transparent about our ingredients so guests can make the right choice for them.”\n\nAt this point in time, the people behind the lawsuit are asking that those who have purchased a McRib within the last four years receive class certification and later, “compensatory damages, restitution, and injunctive relief.” Whether you're a McRib fan or not, staying informed about what's in your food helps you make the best choices for you and your family. And if you're craving that tangy BBQ flavor? Now you know exactly what you're getting.\n\nLooking for more trending stories?

    "fullText": "Two conservation groups are suing Alaska's Board of Game over a program that authorizes helicopter shooting of both brown bears and black bears across a sprawling 40,000-square-mile zone in the state's southwest.\n\nAs the Center for Biological Diversity detailed, it brought the case before the state superior court alongside the Alaska Wildlife Alliance, claiming the Mulchatna bear control program violates Alaska's constitutional requirement to manage wildlife sustainably.\n\nThe state's highest court has previously ruled this provision covers all wildlife, bears included.\n\nUnder a previous version of this program, state officials shot 175 brown bears and another five black bears over the 2023-2024 season.\n\nThe reinstated program allows officials to shoot bears regardless of age, with no limit on how many can be killed, through 2028.\n\nThe targeted area lies just miles from Lake Clark National Preserve and Katmai National Park, putting bears that travel across protected and unprotected territory at risk.\n\n\"This is a disgraceful misuse of public resources and a betrayal of the trust Alaskans place in their wildlife managers,\" said Cooper Freeman, Alaska director at the Center for Biological Diversity.\n\n\"State officials should protect all of our wildlife for future generations, not flaunt their power by orchestrating the mass killing of iconic bears with no scientific basis.\"\n\nThe program has caused outrage on social media.\n\n\"Stop letting politicians run natural resources programs,\" one Instagram commenter wrote. \"Hand them to biologists.\"\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nAnother pleaded, \"This should never happen! Please save the bears and other wildlife!\"\n\nA state court already invalidated an earlier version of this program in March 2025, ruling it was adopted without reliable scientific information about how many bears actually live in the region.\n\nMonths later, state officials reinstated it without first gathering the population data that the ruling had called for.\n\nBears are irreplaceable to their ecosystems, carrying seeds and distributing nutrients across wide areas. A program that lacks both kill caps and population counts could throw wildlife numbers off balance across the region and affect nearby communities and protected lands.\n\nAccording to the Royal Society, \"Biodiversity is essential for the processes that support all life on Earth, including humans.\"\n\nA shift in the natural order can impact everything from water and air quality to the human food supply.\n\nPredators, such as bears, are essential for controlling prey populations. In Scotland, for example, experts are considering reintroducing wolves to reduce the number of deer, which are growing out of control and preventing the growth of important shrubs.\n\n\"How we treat our animals, our elders, our veterans, and our most vulnerable shows us exactly who we are as a country,\" one Instagram user commented.\n\nIf you want to support bear protection efforts, donate to or volunteer with the Alaska Wildlife Alliance or Center for Biological Diversity.\n\nMeanwhile, contacting Alaska state legislators to oppose predator control programs that lack scientific backing can help inform lawmakers of public perception.\n\nSharing information about this lawsuit with friends and family can also encourage public pressure for wildlife protections based on science, not politics.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is still keen on removing Jerome Powell as chair of the Federal Reserve.\n\nNear the end of his Monday briefing at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, a reporter asked Trump if he would tell Powell to resign. The president said he was \"getting pretty close,\" adding, \"I would fire him.\"\n\nHe said he would announce Powell's replacement sometime in January. His comments came at the end of the briefing, which he held with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nDuring the briefing, Trump threw several insults at Powell, calling him \"an absolute fool.\" He also brought out a common insult, \"too late Powell,\" a reference to Powell not lowering interest rates as quickly as Trump wanted him to.\n\nTrump said he would launch a \"gross incompetence lawsuit\" against the Fed chair, repeating his old criticisms of Powell not lowering interest rates and spending too much on a renovation of the Federal Reserve building.\n\nIn response to a request for comment from Business Insider, a Fed representative said he had nothing to add.\n\nPowell, 72, has served as the Fed's chair since 2017, when Trump nominated him to the top job during his first term. He was reappointed for a second term in 2022, which is set to end in May 2026.\n\nTrump has repeatedly called for Powell's resignation since the start of his term.\n\nIn April, he said in a Truth Social post that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough,\" after the chair criticized his wide-ranging tariffs and said they could lead to high inflation and weak economic growth.\n\nIn July, sources confirmed to Business Insider that Trump had asked a group of lawmakers about firing Powell, and they gave him their approval for the decision.\n\nHowever, Trump appeared to backtrack that same month, saying that he was \"highly unlikely\" to take that step and that his administration would choose someone else for the role within the next eight months.",

(AP) — California this week dropped a lawsuit officials filed against the Trump administration over the federal government's withdrawing of $4 billion for the state's long-delayed high-speed rail project.\n\nThe U.S. Transportation Department slashed funds for the bullet train aimed at connecting San Francisco to Los Angeles in July. The Trump administration has said the California High-Speed Rail Authority had “ no viable plan ” to complete a large segment of the project in the farm-rich Central Valley.\n\nThe authority quickly filed a lawsuit, with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom calling the federal government's decision “a political stunt to punish California.”\n\nThe authority said this week that it would focus on other funding sources to complete the project, which is estimated to cost more than $100 billion.\n\n“This action reflects the State’s assessment that the federal government is not a reliable, constructive, or trustworthy partner in advancing high-speed rail in California,” an authority spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe Transportation Department did not respond to a request for comment. President Donald Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have both previously criticized the project as a “train to nowhere.”\n\n“The Railroad we were promised still does not exist, and never will,” Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social in July. “This project was Severely Overpriced, Overregulated, and NEVER DELIVERED.”\n\nThe authority's decision to drop the lawsuit comes as the group seeks private investors to support the bullet train. The project recently secured $1 billion in annual funding from the state's cap-and-trade program through 2045.\n\nThe program sets a declining limit on total planet-warming emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their emissions. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.\n\nThe rail authority said its shift in focus away from federal funding offers “a new opportunity.”\n\n“Moving forward without the Trump administration’s involvement allows the Authority to pursue proven global best practices used successfully by modern high-speed rail systems around the world,” a spokesperson said in a statement.",

The family had planned a vacation to Serbia to visit family and friends, the lawsuit stated.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Delta said that \"the allegations at issue relate to flights not operated by Delta Air Lines.\" The airline added that it will \"review the complaint and respond accordingly in due course.\"\n\nThe filing states the flights were round-trip and business class, purchased through Delta's SkyMiles program, and operated by KLM. The four tickets were worth $8,800 at the time, according to the suit.\n\nRoughly two hours into the flight to Amsterdam, one of the plaintiffs started to feel like she was being bitten by bugs crawling on her, according to the filing. She then realized that bugs were \"crawling on her light-colored sweater,\" the filing stated.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the couple \"immediately\" notified the flight staff and were told to keep their voices down to avoid causing \"panic\" on the plane. The couple took photos and videos of the bugs crawling on the sweater and in the creases of their seats, which were included in the lawsuit.\n\nPrior to landing, the flight attendants urged the couple again not to tell anyone about the infestation because they would miss their connecting flight to Serbia if they did, the filing stated.\n\nA little over a week after the incident, the couple took their children to doctors in Roanoke, Virginia, where it was confirmed that the bites were caused by bed bugs, the lawsuit said. The family was recommended to employ \"bug bombs\" in their home and car, and wash their clothing in hot water, the filing said.\n\nWhile bed bugs are an unusual complaint, this isn't the first time passengers have turned to the courts after a bad flight experience. In September, 16 passengers sued American Airlines after their flight caught fire. Last year, a passenger sued Delta for $1 million, alleging a faulty armrest broke his rib.\n\nKLM did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to reallocate federal Homeland Security funding away from states that refuse to cooperate with certain federal immigration enforcement.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mary McElroy's ruling on Monday solidified a win for the coalition of 12 attorneys general that sued the administration earlier this year after being alerted that their states would receive drastically reduced federal grants due to their “sanctuary” jurisdictions.\n\nIn total, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency reduced more than $233 million from Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. The money is part of a $1 billion program where allocations are supposed to be based on assessed risks, with states then largely passing most of the money on to police and fire departments.\n\nThe cuts were unveiled shortly after a separate federal judge in a different legal challenge ruled it was unconstitutional for the federal government to require states to cooperate on immigration enforcement actions to get FEMA disaster funding.\n\nIn her 48-page ruling, McElroy found that the federal government was weighing states' police on federal immigration enforcement on whether to reduce federal funding for the Homeland Security Grant Program and others.\n\n“What else could defendants’ decisions to cut funding to specific counterterrorism programming by conspicuous round numbered amounts — including by slashing off the millions-place digits of awarded sums — be if not arbitrary and capricious? Neither a law degree nor a degree in mathematics is required to deduce that no plausible, rational formula could produce this result,” McElroy wrote.\n\nThe Trump-appointed judge then ordered the Department of Homeland Security to restore the previously announced funding allocations to the plaintiff states.\n\n“Defendants’ wanton abuse of their role in federal grant administration is particularly troublesome given the fact that they have been entrusted with a most solemn duty: safeguarding our nation and its citizens,\" McElroy wrote. \"While the intricacies of administrative law and the terms and conditions on federal grants may seem abstract to some, the funding at issue here supports vital counterterrorism and law enforcement programs.”\n\nMcElroy notably cited the recent Brown University attack, where a gunman killed two students and injured nine others, as an event where the $1 billion federal program would be vital in responding to such a tragedy.\n\n“To hold hostage funding for programs like these based solely on what appear to be defendants’ political whims is unconscionable and, at least here, unlawful,” the Rhode Island-based judge wrote in her ruling, issued little more than a week after the Brown shooting.\n\nDHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the department plans on fighting the order.\n\n“This judicial sabotage threatens the safety of our states, counties, towns, and weakens the entire nation,\" McLaughlin said. \"We will fight to restore these critical reforms and protect American lives.”\n\nMeanwhile, attorneys general who sued the administration applauded the order.\n\n“This victory ensures that the Trump Administration cannot punish states that refuse to help carry out its cruel immigration agenda, particularly by denying them lifesaving funding that helps prepare for and respond to disasters and emergencies,” said Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell in a statement.",

It further asserts that the infestation caused “severe and permanent emotional distress, humiliation, mental anguish, indignity, loss of pleasures and enjoyment of life,” which will require psychological and psychiatric treatment.\n\nThe infestation also required the victims to spend money on medical care, and caused lost wages, according to the suit.\n\nThe bites from the bugs caused severe injuries, the lawsuit claims, which caused a “significant amount of pain and suffering.”\n\nThe guests are suing for damages and legal costs.",

    "fullText": "Rugby players who allege they suffered brain injuries during their careers have been refused permission to appeal against a decision ordering them to provide all of their medical records.\n\nMore than 1,100 players – across both league and union - claim they are suffering from conditions such as dementia, Parkinson's and motor neurone disease because of repeated impacts sustained throughout their careers.\n\nThey accuse World Rugby, the Rugby Football Union (RFU), the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU), the Rugby Football League (RFL) and others of failing to protect them from risks. The governing bodies deny liability.\n\nIn a previous hearing, Susan Rodway KC for the players said the order to provide medical records was \"impossible, onerous and costly\".\n\nBut a High Court judge has refused the appeal, saying the order is \"not disproportionate, oppressive, irrational or legally perverse\".\n\nRylands Garth, the law firm bringing the case, said it is grateful to the judge for providing clarity and that it would comply with the court's orders.\n\nJudge Dexter Dias said orders issued in February 2024 and 2025 which required the claimants to hand over medical records and all documents from neurological testing were proportionate and necessary to manage the litigation.\n\nWorld Rugby, the RFU and the WRU said in a joint statement that \"player welfare remains a central priority for rugby and we shall not stand still in this space\".\n\nSteve Thompson, Mark Regan and Phil Vickery - part of England's 2003 Rugby World Cup-winning squad - former Wales stars Gavin Henson, Colin Charvis and Ryan Jones and ex-England and British and Lions scrum-half Harry Ellis are among those seeking damages from World Rugby, the RFU and the WRU.\n\nIn November, former British and Irish Lions Lee Byrne and Phil Greening were confirmed to have joined the concussion lawsuit.\n\nIn their joint statement, the governing bodies said: \"The judgement expressed concern that there has been a serious erosion of the court's confidence in the way the disclosure process has been conducted, and noted that effective and fair disclosure of the relevant documents was 'indispensable' in the context of the case.\n\n\"As such many players in the case are at risk of having their claims struck out.\"\n\nRylands Garth is being investigated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority over former England prop Will Green's claims that the firm attempted to pressurise him into joining the action despite him obtaining a second, independent diagnosis that showed no sign of brain injury.\n\nThe case is scheduled to be reviewed again in March 2026.",

    "fullText": "Toyota can’t seem to catch a break in court lately. Last month, the company dealt with a $5.7-billion lawsuit over the hydrogen-powered Mirai, with owners saying the car was basically unusable because there’s nowhere to refuel. Now, Toyota’s back in the hot seat, but this time it’s about something significantly more common: automatic transmissions.\n\nThe latest lawsuit was filed this month in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, led by a Camry owner named James LeBoutheller. He says his car’s transmission started acting up, but every time he brought it to the dealer, he was told it was just “normal operation.” Only after things got worse did someone finally find metal shavings in the transmission fluid – a clear sign something inside had failed. By that point, Toyota apparently refused to pay for the full repair.\n\nThe lawsuit claims Toyota kept selling cars with a known transmission defect and didn’t warn buyers about the risk.\n\nThe heart of the issue is Toyota’s UA80 eight-speed automatic. According to the lawsuit, it’s got both a mechanical flaw and software that doesn’t help matters. The result? Too much heat, parts wearing out early, and transmissions that eventually give up. It is said that the transmission is “predisposed to premature failure” due to overheating, degraded fluid, and internal component wear, which may occasionally cause stalling or loss of power.\n\nThe lawsuit covers a wide range of vehicles, including:\n\nToyota Highlander (2017–present)\n\nToyota Grand Highlander (2023–present)\n\nLexus NX 250 / NX 350 (2022–present)\n\nOwners say Toyota tried to quietly fix the problem with service bulletins and behind-the-scenes updates, all while still advertising these cars as reliable.\n\nThis isn’t just a one-off case, either. Earlier this month, another class-action lawsuit popped up in California, asking for about $5 million over the same UA80 transmission. The complaints are almost identical: Toyota knew about the problem, repairs cost a fortune once the warranty runs out, and help from the company is hit or miss.\n\nIn both cases, owners point to online complaints, NHTSA filings, and dealership acknowledgments as evidence that Toyota was well aware of the issue. The Texas lawsuit expands the scope by pushing for nationwide class certification and broader remedies, including warranty extensions or recalls.\n\nWhat happens next is fairly predictable. Toyota is expected to file a motion to dismiss or narrow the claims, while plaintiffs will push for discovery to access internal documents. Whether these cases gain traction or eventually consolidate remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the UA80 transmission isn’t done causing headaches, for owners or for Toyota.\n\nView the 4 images of this gallery on the original article",

    "description": "An Asheville father has sued Mission Hospital and an employee who was driving a company vehicle when he allegedly struck and killed a cyclist.",
    "fullText": "ASHEVILLE - An Asheville father has filed a lawsuit against Mission Hospital and one of its employees after the employee allegedly struck and killed his son on Swannanoa River Road while driving a company vehicle.\n\nMichael Rozos, the father of Alexander Rozos, filed the lawsuit Dec. 18 in Buncombe County Superior Court against the driver, Mauricio Roberto Melgar Delgado, HCA Healthcare, Mission Hospital and its parent companies.\n\nAn Asheville Police Department investigation showed Alexander Rozos was riding a bicycle west along Swannanoa River Road around 11:42 a.m. July 18, 2024, while a driver identified as Delgado, 48, was driving a white box truck in the same direction behind him. After both Rozos and Delgado passed through the intersection of South Tunnel Road, Delgado overtook Rozos, fatally striking and running him over, an APD incident report confirms.\n\nThe lawsuit reveals that at the time of the crash, Delgado was driving a 2019 Kenworth truck – owned by HCA – “within the course and scope of his employment” with Mission Hospital. Rozos' attorney, Thomas Killoren Jr., described the vehicle as a \"20,000-pound, large delivery vehicle.\"\n\nDelgado drove the truck away before officers arrived, and Alexander Rozos died at the scene of the collision, the Citizen Times previously reported.\n\nRozos was a Haw Creek resident, cyclist and athlete who had been recruited by the military on a fast track to the United States Army Special Forces, his father previously told the Citizen Times. An avid climber, Rozos was riding to a climbing gym when he was struck, Michael Rozos said.\n\n\"He was riding his bike to work and was hit and killed for absolutely no reason. Where do you start to describe the loss that these parents have experienced? It's just devastating and it must stop,\" Killoren Jr. told the Citizen Times Dec. 19.\n\nThe lawsuit claims negligence and wrongful death by Delgado, along with vicarious liability and negligent hiring and supervision by Mission Hospital and HCA. The lawsuit cited a legal doctrine called respondeat superior, which holds an employer legally responsible for the wrongful acts of an employee.\n\n“HCA Defendants are vicariously liable for the negligent, careless, and reckless acts and omissions of their employee/agent,” the lawsuit said.\n\nThe HCA defendants were negligent in hiring and supervision by either failing to have policies in place to train and monitor their drivers or failing to enforce them, the lawsuit claims. The suit also alleges the company failed to have or enforce drivers’ compliance with motor vehicle laws and failed to have or implement an adequate safety program for the “safety and protection of the motoring public.”\n\nMore: Asheville police find, charge driver in hit-and-run death of cyclist; victim named\n\nThe lawsuit goes on to further claim that HCA and Mission Hospital failed to properly investigate Delgado’s driving record and ensure he had the right training, credentials and skills to drive a company vehicle. HCA and Mission Hospital “knew or should have known” Delgado could not drive a vehicle safely and effectively, the lawsuit claims.\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking a jury trial and damages to cover hospital bills, funeral expenses and compensation for pain and suffering.\n\nMission Hospital spokesperson Nancy Lindell did not respond to Citizen Times questions sent Dec. 19, including whether Delgado is still employed by Mission and what guidelines the hospital and HCA have in place for hiring and training drivers.\n\nDelgado was indicted to Buncombe County Superior Court on Nov. 4, 2024, under a charge of felony hit and run inflicting serious injury or death.

And office-seekers aren't entitled to presidential immunity, they contend.\n\n“President Trump has the burden of proof here,” said plaintiffs' attorney Joseph Sellers. “We submit that he hasn't come anywhere close to satisfying that burden.”\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who chaired the House Homeland Security Committee, sued Trump, his personal attorney Rudolph Giuliani and members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers extremist groups over the Jan. 6 riot. Other Democratic members of Congress later joined the litigation.\n\nThe civil claims survived Trump's sweeping act of clemency on the first day of his second term, when he pardoned, commuted prison sentences and ordered the dismissal of all 1,500-plus criminal cases stemming from the Capitol siege.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Lawsuit is the first UK case of its kind, with Ros and Mark Dowey accusing Meta of ‘putting profit before our young people’\n\nThe parents of a 16-year-old who took his own life after he fell victim to a sextortion gang on Instagram are suing Meta for the alleged wrongful death of their son, in the first UK case of its kind.\n\nMurray Dowey died in December 2023 at his family home in Dunblane, after being tricked into sending intimate pictures to an Instagram contact. He thought it was a girl his own age, but it turned out to be overseas criminals involved in financially motivated sexual extortion.\n\nSpeaking as the lawsuit was filed in Delaware, where Meta Platforms is incorporated, Murray’s parents Ros and Mark said: “We know what we’re up against. But it’s time social media companies took accountability for what they’ve done to our young people.\n\n“It’s not just sextortion, they’re causing multiple harms, and they’ve been allowed to get away with it.”\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in Delaware superior court by the US-based Social Media Victims Law Center on behalf of the Doweys, as well as the family of Levi Maciejewski, a 13-year-old from Pennsylvania who was also a victim of sextortion.\n\nIt states that the boys’ deaths were “the foreseeable result of Meta’s design decisions and repeated refusals to implement affordable, available and identified safety features due to Meta’s prioritisation of engagement over user safety”.\n\nAccording to the complaint, these design flaws include “collection of personal data without informed consent”, and use of that data to program recommendation products “it knew [were] operating in a manner that recommended teen Instagram users to sextortionists who Meta itself already had identified as predators”.\n\nThe suit alleges Meta’s “failure to safeguard user privacy, including through its continued sharing of Follower and Following data … even after Meta knew that this engagement-focused product feature was resulting in sextortion-related deaths of teen users across the world”.\n\nIt also contends that Meta made “false and misleading statements designed to convince children and parents that Instagram was safe for teens at the same time that internal testing showed that Instagram was matchmaking children to adult predators”.\n\nWhile four British parents are suing TikTok for the alleged wrongful deaths of their children as a result of attempting the viral “blackout challenge” in 2021, this is the first UK case to centre on the crime of sextortion.\n\nCases have risen sharply in recent years across the UK, US and Australia, with teenage boys and young men typically the victims of loosely organised cybercriminal gangs often based in south-east Asia and west Africa.\n\nEarlier this year, the Guardian reported that children as young as 11 to 13 were being targeted for the first time, as criminals behind extortion attempts cast their nets wider in an attempt to trap victims.\n\nThe Doweys’ lawyer, Matthew Bergman, who set up the Social Media Victims Law Center in 2021, said Meta was involved in all the US-based sextortion cases that he had filed to date.\n\n“There are reasons for that. It is a product defect issue and Meta knows it. This complaint cites Meta records only recently made known to the public through [previous joint civil proceedings] and those documents make the deliberateness of these design defects, lack of safeguards, and failures to warn clear,” he said.\n\nReflecting on the two years since his son’s passing, Mark Dowey said: “Nothing’s really changed since Murray died. These predators can still get at our children.”\n\nAs well as their battle to hold Meta to account, Ros and Mark have regularly spoken out about the dangers of sextortion in the hope of raising awareness among parents and young people.\n\nRos said: “As a parent who has first-hand experience of how devastating the flaws can be, you have a duty to warn other parents. You think your kids are safe looking at pictures on Instagram and they’re not.”\n\nMark said that the lawsuit was “a way to get a wee bit of justice for Murray”: “There has to be accountability here because those statements are absolutely damning. [Meta] have known that their products are killing children by their unsafe design and they haven’t done anything about it. They chose to put profit before our young people.”\n\nInstagram, which has previously condemned sextortion as a “horrific” crime, rolled out new safety features – which included preventing screenshots or screen recordings of disappearing images and videos – specifically to protect children from scammers in October 2024.\n\nMeta announced last October that accounts it detects as showing signals of suspicious behaviour would not be able to see people’s follower or following lists, removing their ability to exploit this feature, and would be blocked from being able to request to follow teens.\n\nIn June alone, accounts were blocked one million times. This July, it introduced new block and report features for direct messages.\n\nA spokesperson for Meta said: “Sextortion is a horrific crime. We support law enforcement to prosecute the criminals behind it and we continue to fight them on our apps on multiple fronts.\n\n“Since 2021, we’ve placed teens under 16 into private accounts when they \n\n“We work to prevent accounts showing suspicious behaviour from following teens and avoid recommending teens to them.\n\n“We also take other precautionary steps, like blurring potentially sensitive images sent in DMs and reminding teens of the risks of sharing them, and letting people know when they’re chatting to someone who may be in a different country.”",

    "fullText": "LONDON, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Major banks including JPMorgan, UBS and Citigroup on Thursday won their bid to block a 2.7 billion-pound ($3.6 billion) mass ​lawsuit over alleged foreign exchange rigging.\n\nPhillip Evans, a former inquiry chair at ‌Britain's Competition Markets Authority, was leading the case on behalf of thousands of asset managers, pension funds ‌and financial institutions.\n\nThe lawsuit, which was also brought against Barclays, MUFG and NatWest, was based on findings made by the European Commission, which fined banks more than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in 2019.\n\nSome of the world's biggest investment banks have paid more than ⁠a combined $11 billion in fines ‌to settle U.S., British and European regulatory allegations that traders manipulated currency rates for years.\n\nEvans' case was initially blocked in 2022 ‍by the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), which refused to certify it on an opt-out basis, meaning members of the claimant class would be part of the case unless they decided otherwise.\n\nThe CAT said ​the case could be brought on an opt-in basis, though it accepted that ‌would effectively end the litigation.\n\nEvans' case was revived by the Court of Appeal in 2023, but the banks' appeal was upheld by the United Kingdom's Supreme Court on Thursday.\n\nJudge Vivien Rose said the Competition Appeal Tribunal \"was right to assess the merits of the claim as weak\".\n\nShe added that some members of the claimant class may ⁠have a viable claim, but they had shown ​no interest in pursuing it and represented \"a tiny ​fraction\" of the case's value.\n\nUBS and MUFG welcomed the ruling. JPMorgan and Barclays declined to comment. Citi and NatWest did not immediately ‍respond to a request ⁠for comment.\n\nEvans said in a statement that he would consider \"what options remain available to pursue justice for those affected\".\n\n\"The practical reality is that opt-in proceedings ⁠are unlikely to deliver meaningful redress for the tens of thousands of ordinary individuals and businesses ‌affected by the banks' unlawful conduct,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration said in a court filing Monday that the president’s White House ballroom construction project must continue for unexplained national security reasons and because a preservationists' organization that wants it stopped has no standing to sue.\n\nThe filing was in response to a lawsuit filed last Friday by the National Trust for Historic Preservation asking a federal judge to halt President Donald Trump's project until it goes through multiple independent reviews and a public comment period and wins approval from Congress.\n\nThe administration's 36-page filing included a declaration from Matthew C. Quinn, deputy director of the U.S. Secret Service, the agency responsible for the security of the president and other high-ranking officials, that said more work on the site of the former White House East Wing is still needed to meet the agency’s “safety and security requirements.” The filing did not explain the specific national security concerns; the administration has offered to share classified details with the judge in a private, in-person setting without the plaintiffs present.\n\nThe East Wing had sat atop a emergency operations bunker for the president.\n\nQuinn said even a temporary halt to construction would “consequently hamper” the agency's ability to fulfill its statutory obligations and its protective mission.\n\nA hearing in the case was scheduled for Tuesday in federal court in Washington.\n\nThe government’s response offered the most comprehensive look yet at the ballroom construction project, including a window into how it was so swiftly approved by the Trump administration bureaucracy and its expanding scope.\n\nThe filings assert that final plans for the ballroom have yet to be finalized despite the continuing demolition and other work to prepare the site for eventual construction. Below-ground work on the site continues, wrote John Stanwich, the National Park Service’s liaison to the White House, and work on the foundations is set to begin in January. Above-ground construction “is not anticipated to begin until April 2026, at the earliest,” he wrote.\n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation did not respond to email messages seeking comment.\n\nThe privately funded group last week asked the U.S. District Court to block Trump's project.\n\n“No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever — not President Trump, not President Biden, and not anyone else,” the lawsuit states. “And no president is legally allowed to construct a ballroom on public property without giving the public the opportunity to weigh in.”\n\nTrump had the East Wing torn down in October as part of his plan to build an estimated $300 million, 90,000-square-foot (27,432-square-meter) ballroom able to accommodate about 1,000 people before his term ends in January 2029. He says presidents before him long have wanted an event space larger than the rooms currently at the White House, and says the ballroom would end the practice of entertaining visiting foreign dignitaries in large, temporary pavilions on the south grounds.\n\nThe Trust asserts that the plans should have been submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission, the Commission of Fine Arts and Congress before any action was taken. The lawsuit notes that the Trust wrote to those entities and the National Park Service on Oct. 21, after East Wing demolition began, urging a stop to the project and asking the administration to comply with federal law, but received no response.\n\nThe lawsuit cites several federal statutes and rules detailing the role the planning and fine arts commission and lawmakers play in U.S. government construction projects.\n\nThe administration argued in its response that the president has the authority to modify the White House and included the extensive history of changes and additions to the Executive Mansion since it was built more than 200 years ago. It also asserted that the president is not subject to the statutes cited by the plaintiffs.\n\nDepartment of Justice attorneys said in the filing that the plaintiff's claims about the East Wing demolition are “moot” because the tear-down cannot be undone. The administration also argues that claims about future construction are “unripe” because the plans are not final.\n\nThe administration also contends that the Trust cannot establish “irreparable harm” because above-ground construction is not expected until spring. It argues that the reviews sought in the lawsuit, consultation with the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, “will soon be underway without this Court's involvement.”\n\nTrump's ballroom project has prompted criticism in the historic preservation and architectural communities, and among his political adversaries, but the lawsuit is the most tangible effort thus far to alter or stop his plans for an addition that itself would be nearly twice the size of the White House before the East Wing was torn down.\n\nIn 2000, the National Park Service's Comprehensive Design Plan for the White House first identified the need for a larger event space to address an increase in visitors and to provide a venue suitable for major events, according to the administration's filing.",

He was held in a notoriously brutal prison there despite having no criminal record.\n\n▶ Read more about Abrego Garcia’s case\n\nSen. Mark Kelly’s attorney warns Trump administration of ‘dangerous overreach’\n\nThe attorney’s letter comes as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered a review of the Democratic senator who was among a group of lawmakers in a video calling on military personnel to defy “illegal orders.”\n\n“There is no legitimate basis for any type of proceeding against Senator Kelly, and any such effort would be unconstitutional and an extraordinary abuse of power,” wrote Paul J. Fishman in the letter to Navy Secretary John Phelan.\n\nTrump himself had lashed out at the lawmakers, who all have military backgrounds after years of service.\n\nKelly’s attorney warned of legal action if the department sought to pursue the senator in any forum — “criminal, disciplinary, or administrative.”\n\nFishman wrote they would “take all appropriate legal action on Senator Kelly’s behalf to halt the Administration’s unprecedented and dangerous overreach.”\n\nSecret Service official says ballroom construction doesn’t yet meet agency’s security standards\n\nIn its Monday court filing, the Trump administration included a declaration from the deputy director of the U.S. Secret Service saying more work on the site of the former White House East Wing is still needed to meet the agency’s “safety and security requirements.”\n\nThe administration has offered to share classified details with the judge in-person without the plaintiffs present.\n\nThe project has prompted criticism in the historic preservation and architectural communities, and among Trump’s political adversaries, but the lawsuit by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a privately funded group, is the most tangible effort thus far to alter or stop the 90,000-square-foot (8,361-square-meter) addition.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to block construction until the project goes through comprehensive design reviews, environmental assessments, public comments and congressional debate and ratification.\n\nTrump administration says White House ballroom construction is a matter of national security\n\nFor that reason, the construction project must continue, the Trump administration said in a court filing Monday.\n\nThe filing came in response to a lawsuit filed last Friday by the National Trust for Historic Preservation asking a federal judge to halt the project until it goes through multiple independent reviews and wins approval from Congress.\n\nExecutive order directs whole of government mobilization against drug traffickers\n\nThe order instructs the State and Treasury departments to pursue the financial assets of and sanctions on financial institutions and groups involved in fentanyl trafficking. It also calls for greater cooperation between the Pentagon and Justice Department on fentanyl and drug trafficking issues.\n\nThe order directs the homeland security secretary to “identify threat networks related to fentanyl smuggling” by using intelligence resources that in the past were devoted to the detection of other weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe federal government by law has a wide range of national security and law enforcement capabilities to combat drug smuggling, including asset forfeiture, targeted arrests and surveillance of criminal organizations.\n\nThe Trump administration’s earlier this year designated some drug cartels as terror groups, a move that may unlock more coordination between the armed forces and domestic law enforcement but has been questioned by legal analysts over its scope and legality.\n\nWisconsin judge allows case against former Trump aides to proceed to trial\n\nA Wisconsin judge has ruled there is enough evidence to proceed to trial in a felony forgery case against an attorney and an aide to President Donald Trump related to action taken after 2020 election.\n\nThe judge on Monday at a preliminary hearing found there was probable cause to proceed with the charges after taking testimony from a special agent with the state Department of Justice who detailed the allegations.\n\nThe charges relate to attempts by the former aides to present a slate of Republican electors to Congress falsely claiming that Trump had won Wisconsin that year.\n\nFormer Trump attorney Jim Troupis and former Trump aide Mike Roman were in court for the hearing but did not testify. The judge postponed the preliminary hearing for a third person charged, Ken Chesebro, amid questions about what comments he made to prosecutors could be admitted in court.\n\nPence’s group urges Trump to fire RFK Jr.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence’s group Advancing American Freedom on Monday called on Trump to fire Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over what the group argues has been a slow-walked safety review of the chemical abortion drug mifepristone.\n\nKennedy and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary have pledged to review the drug’s safety but are facing mounting pressure from abortion opponents to move more quickly. Mifepristone, which was approved 25 years ago, has repeatedly been deemed safe and effective by FDA scientists.\n\nIn a statement alongside Monday’s memo, the Republican Pence accused Kennedy of being unable or unwilling to keep promises to abortion opponents and said he should step aside.\n\nThe attacks come as Kennedy has faced criticism from both sides but also waves of support as he seeks to dramatically reshape the nation’s health agencies and target vaccines.\n\nTrump again says he’s ended hostilities between Thailand and Cambodia. But fighting continues\n\nThe two countries agreed to a ceasefire in July, and formalized the deal in October when Trump was in Malaysia. But lately, fighting has resumed. Trump on Friday said he had called the leaders and got them to agree to another truce -- but officials said heavy combat continues.\n\nNevertheless, Trump on Monday said in the Oval Office that “we were able to straighten that out.”\n\nThe two countries were “having a little problem yesterday,” Trump said. “I called them and I said, ‘look, fellas, relax. You gotta take it easy.’ They started the war again, and I got it ended.”\n\nTrump says he has asked Xi to free Jimmy Lai\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he feels “so badly” about Jimmy Lai, a former Hong Kong media mogul who on Monday was convicted in a landmark national security case.\n\nLai, 78, now could spend the rest of his life in prison. On Monday, Trump confirmed that he has brought up Lai’s case with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and asked for Lai’s release.\n\n“I spoke to President XI about it, and I asked to consider his release,” Trump said. “He’s not well, he’s an older man, and he’s not well, so I did put that request out. We’ll see what happens.”\n\nIn London and Washington, Jimmy Lai’s children have expressed gratitude for the support from the Trump administration.\n\nPresident Trump praises José Antonio Kast’s win in Chilean presidential election\n\nTrump touted the win by Kast, a far right conversative who comfortably defeated his left-of-center opponent in Sunday’s election, as a sign of his broader influence on politics across the Western Hemisphere.\n\n“I look forward to pay my respects to him here,” Trump said of Kast. “He’s a very good person.”\n\nKast is the most conservative candidate to win Chile’s presidential election in 35 years. He won 58.2% of the votes on a campaign heavily centered on crime and immigration.\n\nTrump defends Syria’s new leader after attack that killed three Americans\n\nTrump said Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa “feels very badly” about an attack over the weekend that claimed the lives of two Iowa National Guard members and a U.S. civilian.\n\nTrump said the attack happened in a region of Syria that the new government doesn’t control.\n\n“This had nothing to do with him,” said Trump, speaking of al-Sharaa. He hosted al-Sharaa at the White House in November.\n\n“He feels very badly about it. He’s working on it. He’s a strong man, and this had nothing to do with the Syrian government,” Trump said.\n\nThe U.S. military and Trump have blamed the attack on the Islamic State group. Trump has threatened to retaliate.\n\nTrump defends FBI and calls Brown shooting a ‘school problem’\n\nTrump defended the FBI after a mass shooting at Brown University, arguing that questions about the case should be directed to officials at the Ivy League school in Rhode Island.\n\nTrump told reporters in the Oval Office that authorities do not yet know a motive in the shooting that killed two and injured others.\n\nPressed about why the FBI has not been able to identify a shooter, Trump called it a “school problem.” Brown “had their own guards, they had their own police and their own everything,” he said.\n\nTrump told reporters to “ask that question, really, to the school, not to the FBI,” which he said “came in after the fact.”\n\nHe said the FBI “will do a good job,” and cited the Charlie Kirk assassination as an example. In that case, the alleged killer’s family helped turn him in to authorities.\n\nTrump says the administration is considering changing how it treats marijuana\n\n“We are considering the idea because a lot of people want to see it,” the president said.\n\nTrump had said in August that he was reviewing whether the federal government should reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug. Such a step could move the federal government closer to an approach already embraced by many states.\n\n“We are looking at that very strongly,” Trump said at the White House.\n\nTrump doubles down on criticizing Reiner and calls him ‘deranged’\n\nThe president was asked if he stood by his social media post in light of the pushback he was getting, including from those in his own party.\n\nUsing the third person, Trump said Reiner “was a deranged person as far as Trump is concerned.”\n\n“I was not a fan of Rob Reiner at all, in any way shape or form,” Trump said. “I thought he was very bad for our country.”\n\nTrump signs executive order classifying fentanyl as a ‘weapon of mass destruction’\n\nHe signed the order in the Oval Office on Monday while flanked by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Dan Caine, White House border czar Tom Homan and other top military officials.\n\nTrump says his administration is “formally classifying fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction, which is what it is. No bomb does what this is doing.”\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the new designation would affect administration policy or what the legal implications would be for those impacted by fentanyl use or drug traffickers.\n\nThe term weapon of mass destruction has typically referred to nuclear, biological, chemical or kinetic threats capable of causing overwhelming and lasting damage to a population, infrastructure or environment. The term has also been hotly debated in American politics since the U.S. invasion of Iraq.\n\nTrump is recognizing 13 military service members with a Mexican Border Defense Medal\n\nThe president is in the Oval Office with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Trump border czar Tom Homan, all of them hailing the border defense portion of his immigration crackdown.\n\nMilitary commanders and the award recipients looked on as Trump, Hegseth and Homan declared the border secure. Trump said his administration has “stopped the invasion in its tracks, and we are dismantling the cartels very rapidly.”\n\nHe added many hits from his 2024 campaign speech, blasting the immigration policies of his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, and declaring migrants who crossed the border “some of the worst people on Earth.”\n\nHoman praised “greatest president of my lifetime – yes, I said it.” Hegseth said the medal is a reprisal of a military honor awarded previously in the early 20th century\n\nTrump expresses optimism that Russia-Ukraine war is nearing the end\n\n“I think we’re closer now than we have been, ever,” Trump said while recapping war talks in Europe at the start of an unrelated White House event.\n\nTrump said he had a “long talk” with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He also spoke with the leaders of several European countries, including Germany, Italy, France and the United Kingdom as well as NATO.\n\n“Things are going along pretty well,” the president said.\n\nTrump said everyone wants to see the war end.\n\nPresident Trump to deliver remarks in North Carolina on Friday\n\nThe president’s upcoming trip to Rocky Mount was confirmed by Republican Senate candidate Michael Whatley, a close Trump ally who was chair of the Republican National Committee during the 2024 election.\n\n“Let’s give him the North Carolina welcome he deserves,” Whatley wrote on social media. Whatley did not describe a reason for the trip in his social media post.\n\nThe event will take place at the Rocky Mount Events Center. Trump last week traveled to Pennsylvania to discuss the economy and cost of living.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson urges an appeal to ‘our better angels’ after weekend violence\n\n“We’re seeing a lot of tragedies,” the GOP speaker said as he arrived at the Capitol.\n\nHe drew on scripture to provide comfort to the Reiner family and others after “the senseless violence” this past weekend in Australia and at Brown University.\n\n“We have to appeal to our better angels,” Johnson said, and “I think we have to amplify those voices.”He declined to answer questions about Trump’s insensitive remarks after Reiner’s death.\n\nUS, Paraguay sign agreement setting out legal basis for American troops in the country\n\nThe United States and Paraguay have signed an agreement laying out the legal framework for American troops to be stationed the in the South American country and clearing the way for further defense and intelligence cooperation between the two as the Trump administration steps up military operations throughout the western hemisphere.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio and Paraguayan Foreign Minister Ruben Ramirez signed the so-called “status of forces” agreement on Monday at the State Department. Both men hailed the deal as a step forward in relations that would enhance already strong counter-terrorism and -narcotics measures.\n\nSuch agreements outline the legal requirements and immunities for U.S. troops to be present in other countries, although there was no immediate announcement of any deployments to Paraguay.\n\nCalifornia hires two former CDC officials who rebuffed Trump, Kennedy\n\nCalifornia is hiring two former top federal health officials, state officials said Monday.\n\nSusan Monarez, the former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is helping California launch an effort to maintain trust in science-driven decision-making and improve public health infrastructure.\n\nMonarez is being joined by Dr. Debra Houry, CDC’s former chief medical officer. Both will be advisors, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced.\n\nThe White House fired Monarez in August when she fell out of favor with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after only one month on the job. Houry and some other top CDC officials resigned in protest.\n\nA few Republicans speak out against Trump post on Reiner\n\nA few Republican members of Congress are calling out President Donald Trump’s insensitive social media post regarding the deaths of director-actor Rob Reiner and his wife Michele.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky tweeted ox X that regardless of how one felt about Reiner, “this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered.”\n\nRep. Mike Lawler of New York said of Trump’s post: “This statement is wrong. Regardless of one’s political views, no one should be subjected to violence, let alone at the hands of their own son. It’s a horrible tragedy that should engender sympathy and compassion from everyone in our country, period.”\n\nAnd Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia tweeted: “This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies. Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It’s incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder.”\n\nNY Attorney General Letitia James makes first comments on the repeated efforts to revive a criminal case against her\n\nJames said Monday she isn’t spending a lot of time thinking about the Trump administration’s repeated efforts to revive a criminal case against her.\n\nJames, a Democrat, made her first public comments about the matter at an unrelated press conference after the news last week that a second federal grand jury had declined to indict her on charges related to her purchase of a home in Norfolk, Virginia, in 2020.\n\n“I don’t really spend a lot of time focused on this campaign of retribution,” said James. “I’ve got a lot of work on my hands — standing up and defending the rights of New Yorkers, protecting them from harms coming from Washington, D.C.”\n\nA judge last month threw out an indictment charging James with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution, ruling that the prosecutor who brought the case at Republican President Donald Trump’s urging was illegally appointed by the Justice Department.\n\n“I’ve got a job to do,” said James, who had pleaded not guilty to the earlier indictment and denies any wrongdoing.\n\nPoll shows health costs are a rising concern among Americans\n\nAbout 3 in 10 Americans cite the cost of health care as the most urgent health problem facing the country, and about one-quarter say the health care system is in “crisis,” according to a new Gallup poll released Monday.\n\nThe poll also shows that only 16% of Americans are satisfied with the cost of health care in the U.S.\n\nThe findings from the survey conducted in November come as Congress has yet to address the spiking health insurance premium costs facing millions of Americans when Affordable Care Act health subsidies expire at the start of the new year.\n\nIt also comes as health expenses have risen across the board in response to a variety of factors, including inflation and the increasing use of expensive medications such as GLP-1 weight loss drugs.\n\nHunter Biden disbarred in Connecticut after complaints about federal convictions\n\nBiden agreed to the penalty and admitted to violating the state’s attorney conduct rules, but he did not admit to committing any crimes.\n\nHis father, former President Joe Biden, pardoned him last year after he was convicted of three felonies relating to a 2018 gun purchase and pleaded guilty to failing to pay federal taxes. He previously was disbarred in Washington, D.C.\n\nA Connecticut judge ordered the disbarment on Monday. Hunter Biden did not speak and he and his lawyer appeared via video at the virtual court hearing in Waterbury.\n\nThe judge found that Hunter Biden violated several lawyer ethics rules, including engaging in conduct “involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.”\n\nIn a court document, Hunter Biden admitted to some but not all of the misconduct allegations. The judge also cited the Washington disbarment. He was admitted to the Connecticut bar in 1997, a year after graduating from Yale Law School.\n\nWhite House views Russian openness to Ukraine joining the EU as a big deal\n\nThe U.S. officials who briefed reporters after Witkoff and Kushner met with Zelenskyy and other European officials in Berlin over the last two days said such an offer over Ukraine joining the EU would be a major concession by Moscow. But Russia has previously said it doesn’t object to Ukraine joining the EU.",

    "title": "Judge expresses skepticism toward Epstein victim lawsuit against big banks alleging they facilitated sex-trafficking",
    "description": "The Jeffrey Epstein victims'  lawsuits resembled two others, against JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, which settled for hundreds of millions.",
    "fullText": "A federal judge expressed skepticism about a pair of lawsuits that victims of Jeffrey Epstein had filed against two banks, suggesting he may dismiss them before they have a chance to go to trial.\n\nAt the outset of a Monday afternoon hearing in Manhattan federal court, US District Judge Jed Rakoff unfavorably compared the lawsuits against Bank of America and BNY Mellon to two similar lawsuits he had previously overseen, against JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank. JPMorgan agreed to settle the case for $290 million. Deutsche Bank agreed to settle for $75 million.\n\nRakoff said the language in the lawsuits against Bank of America and BNY Mellon — which were brought by the same attorneys and filed in October — was \"frequently conclusory\" and appeared to lack sufficient detail to demonstrate what the banks did wrong. He called the lawsuits \"a model of high-pitched rhetoric.\"\n\n\"'Knows' without saying by whom is vague. 'Affiliated' without saying what that means is vague,\" Rakoff told David Boies, an attorney who brought the case. \"A lot of that language is in the complaint.\"\n\nAt the end of the hearing, Rakoff gave the lawyers who brought the lawsuits on behalf of Epstein victims — David Boies, Sigrid McCawley, Brad Edwards, and Brittany Henderson — two weeks to revise their cases with more specific details about their allegations.\n\nThe judge said they would be permitted to use material they had already gathered as part of the discovery process in the case, but should put a hold on additional depositions and subpoenas until he issued a ruling, which he said could come at the end of January.\n\nThe lawsuits allege that Bank of America and BNY Mellon aided in Epstein's sex-trafficking operation by providing him with banking services and then ignoring red flags tied to his transactions.\n\nEpstein, a well-connected financier, killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on criminal sex-trafficking charges. One of his associates, Ghislaine Maxwell, is serving a 20-year prison sentence for trafficking girls to him.\n\nMonday's hearing was scheduled for the judge to weigh motions to dismiss the two lawsuits outright.\n\nCharlotte Taylor, an attorney at the law firm Jones Day representing Bank of America, argued the lawsuits consisted of \"recycled boilerplate allegations\" and that they could not prove the bank provided anything other than \"routine banking services\" to Epstein and his associates. Felicia Ellsworth, an attorney at WilmerHale, said the plaintiffs couldn't prove anyone at BNY Mellon had the \"state of mind\" to be found liable.\n\nBoies told Rakoff that the banks should have noticed enough smoke around the transactions from bank accounts belonging to Epstein and his associates to know there was a fire. Aside from Epstein's 2008 criminal conviction in Florida, he had been dogged by civil litigation for years, Boies said.\n\nRakoff expressed skepticism that the pattern of facts alleged in the lawsuit would be enough.\n\n\"Last I checked, that's not enough to survive a motion to dismiss,\" Rakoff said. \"You need to have enough allegations as to specific facts.\"\n\nFollowing the hearing, lawyers for the Epstein victims appeared eager to revise their lawsuits and include the information they obtained through the discovery process. Rakoff said that material may be redacted on the public docket.\n\n\"I think he's giving us a chance,\" Sigrid McCawley, an attorney at Boies Schiller Flexner, told Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has sued the BBC for defamation over a documentary that his lawyers say presents a \"false and defamatory\" portrayal of him.\n\nOn Monday night, Trump's lawyers filed a civil complaint in a federal court in Florida, seeking at least $5 billion in damages from the British broadcaster.\n\nThe 46-page lawsuit claims that the BBC has defamed Trump in a Panorama documentary that aired about a week before the 2024 election, called \"Trump: A Second Chance.\" The complaint alleges the program presented a \"false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction\" of Trump.\n\nThe suit's allegations focus on how the documentary was edited, specifically regarding footage of Trump's January 6, 2021, speech near the White House.\n\n\"President Trump's powerhouse lawsuit is holding the BBC accountable for its defamation and reckless election interference just as he has held other fake news mainstream media responsible for their wrongdoing,\" a spokesperson for Trump's legal team told Business Insider.\n\nThe filing included correspondence that Trump and the BBC's legal team exchanged in November.\n\nTrump's attorney, Alejandro Brito, wrote a letter to the BBC on November 9, demanding that it retract \"false and defamatory statements\" about Trump. Brito threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion if it did not comply.\n\nThe BBC's legal team wrote back on November 13, saying that the BBC had \"no intention of misleading anyone\" and included a copy of the outlet's apology letter to Trump. The correspondence said that Trump did not have a basis for a defamation claim.\n\nIn a separate online statement on the same day, the BBC said the outlet and its chair, Samir Shah, were \"sorry for the edit of the President's speech on 6 January 2021.\"\n\n\"The BBC has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary 'Trump: A Second Chance?' on any BBC platforms,\" the statement said. \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\"\n\nThe BBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis is a developing story; please check back for updates.",
