    "description": "Bitcoin likely already reached its post-halving peak at $126,000 last year, Jefferies' global head of equity strategy wrote in a note.",
    "fullText": "A longtime crypto bull is ditching bitcoin for gold.\n\nChristopher Wood, the global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, said he just cut bitcoin out of his firm's long-term model portfolio, where the token has accounted for around 5%-10% of the portfolio's allocation for the last five years.\n\nThat's because the price of the crypto has likely peaked, but also because there's an existential threat he sees jeopardizing the bitcoin ecosystem: quantum computing.\n\nIn a recent note to clients, Wood pointed specifically to CRQCs, or cryptographically relevant quantum computers — supercomputers that could potentially \"steal\" bitcoin from circulation, he said.\n\nBitcoin transactions are secured with cryptography, a coding system where transactions are encrypted with public keys, and access to the bitcoin itself is controlled by a private key. It would take supercomputers today \"trillions of years\" to derive a private key from a public one, given how complex the computations are, Wood said. But CRQCs could potentially reduce that time to something like several hours to several days, he speculated.\n\nCRQCs don't yet exist, but chatter about the potential risks is already spreading across the bitcoin community, Wood said, pointing to a report from ChainCode Labs that estimated as much as 10 million tokens, or 50% of all bitcoin in circulation, could be accessed by a CRQC.\n\nSome in the crypto community are arguing that the risk from CRQCs means \"vulnerable coins\" in the bitcoin ecosystem should be burned, Wood bited.\n\n\"While GREED & fear does not believe that the quantum issue is about to hit the Bitcoin price dramatically in the near term, the store of value concept is clearly on less solid foundation from the standpoint of a long-term pension portfolio,\" Wood said of his recent portfolio change. He added that he believed bitcoin reached its peak in the post-halving cycle at $126,000 last year.\n\nWood's team has replaced the allocation to bitcoin in the model portfolio with a 10% allocation to gold and gold mining stocks. The portfolio now has a total 45% allocation to physical gold, a 25% allocation to gold mining stocks, and a 30% allocation to Asian equities, excluding Japan.\n\n\"Meanwhile, the existential issue raised by quantum as regards Bitcoin can only be long-term positive for gold since it remains the historically stress tested store of value. Meanwhile, gold is also the best hedge, if not the only one, on the ever-rising geopolitical risks,\" Wood said.\n\nIt's been a rough few months for bitcoin, with the crypto tumbling into a bear market in late 2025 amid a broader risk-off move that was exacerbated by weak liquidity and concerns about the yen-carry trade.\n\nMeanwhile, the case for owning gold has only grown stronger since its stunning rally in 2025. The metal saw its best performance since 1979 and continues to hover near a record high as investors seek protection from geopolitical conflict and inflationary pressures.",

    "title": "Is Bitcoin Heading for a ‘Parabolic Blowoff’ Mirroring Gold? Analysts Weigh In",
    "description": "Analysts debate whether Bitcoin will follow gold's scarcity-driven surge or take a more volatile path due to structural market differences.",
    "fullText": "Bitcoin's exchange-traded funds could be following the exact structural playbook that preceded gold's historic 2025 surge, a parallel that suggests a potential parabolic move awaits the top cryptocurrency.\n\nThe analogy was highlighted by Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matthew Hougan on a podcast with influencer Michael 'Threadguy' Jerome.\n\n\"That’s the same thing that’s happening in Bitcoin,\" Hougan said, pointing to the transformation in gold after central banks began \"panic buying\" following the 2022 Ukraine war sanctions.\n\nCentral bank demand for gold jumped from 400 tons to over 1,000 tons annually starting in 2022. That relentless buying absorbed supply for years before igniting a price explosion: gold closed 2022 down, rallied 13% in 2023, 27% in 2024, and then surged nearly 65% in 2025.\n\n“Eventually, what gold tells you is that sellers run out of ammo. And that’s when the price goes parabolic,” the analyst said.\n\nHe sees the same pattern in Bitcoin ETFs, which have consistently bought more than 100% of the new supply since launch. “So I do think gold has shown what’s going to happen... we’re going to get to that parabolic blowoff move if that buy-side demand continues.”\n\nThis “gold-first, Bitcoin-follows” pattern has been observed before, as highlighted in a previous Decrypt report, where Lawrence Lepard, co-founder of Equity Management Associates, noted “Gold often moves first, and then Bitcoin follows and outperforms.\"\n\nFurthermore, following gold's major rallies, \"a swift rebound shouldn't be the base case,\" Ryan McMillin, chief investment officer at Merkle Tree Capital, previously told Decrypt, suggesting any follow-on move may require patience.\n\nBitcoin Google Searches Hit 11-Month Low as Gold Continues to Climb\n\nOther analysts agree with the high-level premise—that sustained buying absorbs selling pressure—but caution that Bitcoin’s path will have its own distinct volatility and drivers.\n\nTim Sun, senior researcher at HashKey Group, partially agreed with McMillin’s views. \"At a high level, the fact that sustained structural buying absorbs market selling pressure is indeed a core characteristic of any supply-scarce asset entering a long-term bull market,\" he told Decrypt.\n\nHowever, Sun highlighted critical distinctions in market structure.\n\nGold, Silver Hit New Highs as Bitcoin Trades Flat Ahead of Key Macroeconomic Events\n\nFor gold, buyers are typically central banks and sovereign wealth funds seeking a \"hedge against fiat currency credibility,\" resulting in low-leverage, long-term capital. Bitcoin ETF buyers, while institutional, still treat it as a risk asset, leading to \"far higher\" embedded leverage and trading activity.",

    "description": "Ethereum treasury Bitmine Immersion is making a big investment in MrBeast's company, which said last year it would launch a financial services platform.",
    "fullText": "The biggest ethereum holding company in the world is betting big on the digital finance ambitions of one of the world's top online content creators.\n\nTom Lee, the cofounder of global investment advisory firm Fundstrat Global Advisors, announced on Thursday that Bitmine Immersion Technologies is investing $200 million in Beast Industries, the holding company founded by YouTube star MrBeast.\n\nJimmy Donaldson, better known by his social media moniker, announced plans to launch a financial services platform in December, and Lee said on Thursday that he believes it will play a pivotal role in one of the financial sector's fastest-growing markets.\n\nBeast Industries CEO Jeff Housenbold also hinted at a future partnership, saying in a statement: \"We look forward to exploring ways to further collaborate and incorporate DeFi into our upcoming financial services platform.\"\n\nIn June 2025, Lee led Bitmine's strategic pivot from operating as a bitcoin miner to becoming the world's largest ethereum treasury, helping usher in last year's investor craze for digital asset holding strategies.\n\n\"MrBeast and Beast Industries, in our view, is the leading content creator of our generation, with a reach and engagement unmatched with Gen Z, Gen Alpha and Millennials,\" he said. \"Beast Industries is the largest and most innovative creator based platform in the world and our corporate and personal values are strongly aligned.\"\n\nLee said on CNBC that he sees his bet on Beast Industries as a rising player in a broader movement to tokenize assets on the blockchain.\n\n\"Digitalization of not only dollars, but stocks and equities, is going to take place and over time, that really blurs what is a service versus what's digital money,\" he added. \"That's where a collaboration and investment into Beast Industries makes sense.\"\n\nCompanies such as Robinhood have recently embraced asset tokenization, viewing it as a way to offer investors exposure to companies that might still be private or to allow investors to more easily trade hard assets like real estate.\n\nBeast Industries, for its part, has been laying the groundwork for a financial services venture for a while. In a pitch deck shared in early 2025, which was viewed by Business Insider, it described customized offerings that would target MrBeast's audience, supported by financial literacy content. The deck listed nine potential offerings, including student loans, insurance, and credit insights. It said the company would launch by partnering with a fintech company to leverage its existing infrastructure \"while avoiding regulatory, credit risk, and capital requirement.\"\n\nDonaldson has also said he's looking to build a financial literacy-focused channel.\n\nBeast Industries took in over $400 million in revenue in 2024, according to investor materials viewed by Business Insider. The company lost money last year, mainly because of high costs in its media business. Recently, the company has been on a cost-cutting push as it looks to reduce media-related losses.\n\nIn 2025, the social media star sought to raise $200 million to extend a $300 million Series C round he'd raised in 2024 at a $5 billion valuation, according to investment materials viewed by Business Insider.\n\nDonaldson's company has been pitching investors on the idea of building the \"next Disney.\" Like Disney, Beast Industries is looking to expand well beyond video into different product categories.",

    "description": "A crypto token promoted by Eric Adams is linked to Sefi Zvieli, a landlord whose Brooklyn property became a city-backed homeless shelter.",
    "fullText": "A cryptocurrency promoted this week by former New York City mayor Eric Adams spiked in value before rapidly losing most of its gains, and is connected to a landlord who previously secured a lucrative city-backed homeless shelter deal after hiring a lawyer with close ties to Adams.\n\nAdams told journalists Monday morning that the \"NYC Token\" project would generate money to fund blockchain education for underserved New Yorkers and fight antisemitism and \"anti-Americanism.\"\n\nHe didn't say how, or specify who he was working with, but said he wasn't drawing a salary yet.\n\nThe project's website mentions an entity called C18 Digital LLC in its terms of service. An entity with that name was formed in Delaware on December 30. The certificate of formation was signed by Sefi Zvieli.\n\nThe City, a nonprofit news outlet, reported in 2023 that Zvieli avoided foreclosure on a \"filthy, fetid, and dangerous\" block of student housing he owned in Brooklyn by inking a deal to rent it to a New York City-financed nonprofit as a homeless shelter for $3.5 million a year.\n\nThe story said he snagged the deal after hiring Frank Carone, a lawyer with close ties to Adams, after Adams had won the New York City mayoral election but before he was sworn in as mayor. Zvieli has also been listed in public records for various New York companies and has been described by Israeli news outlets as a hotel investor.\n\nIt's unclear what role Zvieli played in NYC Token beyond signing the formation papers. He didn't reply to an email address listed for him in website registration records. Carone didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe token's trading history showed what happened in the hours after Adams plugged it: After peaking around 50 cents per token, its price fell to less than 9 cents per token. It has since risen to around 13 cents per token.\n\nSocial media users who said they had purchased the coin expressed outrage, accusing Adams or people affiliated with the project of stealing funds. The crypto analytics company Bubblemaps said in posts on X that a wallet withdrew $2.5 million of sales proceeds from a liquidity pool associated with NYC Token shortly before its value collapsed, before putting about $1.5 million back.\n\nElissa Buchter, a spokesperson for NYC Token, said in an email that the token's backers were not responsible for its wild performance.\n\n\"Our market maker made adjustments in an attempt to keep trading running smoothly, and as part of this process, moved liquidity,\" she said in an email. \"The team has not sold any tokens and is subject to lockups and transfer restrictions. THE TEAM HAS NOT WITHDRAWN ANY MONEY FROM THE ACCOUNT.\"\n\nA spokesman for Adams shared a statement in which Adams denied profiting from the token's launch, said he didn't personally invest in the token, and said \"no money was taken out of NYC Token.\"\n\n\"The NYC Token was designed as a free, voluntary way to support educational and nonprofit efforts,\" said the spokesman, Todd Shapiro. \"Claims suggesting otherwise are inaccurate.\"\n\nAs mayor, Adams was friendly with some figures in the cryptocurrency industry and converted some of his paychecks to bitcoin. In interviews on Monday, he twice referred to blockchains, the technology that acts as a ledger for many digital asset transactions, as \"blockchange.\"\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the NYC Token, it's so far faring better than \"NYCCoin,\" a token that Adams boosted early in his mayoralty. Trading on that dried up, and it was reportedly disavowed by the city and delisted by its main exchange in 2023.",

    "fullText": "Former New York City Mayor Eric Adams was a bullish proponent of crypto during his time in office, but an ill-fated meme coin debut this week has drawn outcry.\n\nOn January 12, Adams shared a post on his X account announcing the launch of NYC Token, a New York-themed token with no official ties to the city, but which creators said on the token's website would go toward \"critical initiatives.\" Adams said some proceeds would go toward fighting antisemitism and blockchain education for kids.\n\nAs it started trading, the coin quickly surged to a market cap of roughly $580 million before suddenly reversing course and plunging more than 80% in a few minutes.\n\nOutrage from the crypto community has been swift this week.\n\nThe episode drew accusations that investors had been victims of a \"rug pull,\" in which a token's major holders sell after an initial surge, leaving investors locked into their positions and unable to exit without losing money.\n\nWhile NYC Token rose slightly on its second day of trading, accusations that either Adams or the token's creators had \"rugged\" investors continued to swirl. Legal filings show that the company behind NYC Token, c18 digital LLC, was formed in Delaware two weeks ago.\n\nAn anonymous crypto influencer on X shared several posts saying liquidity had been pulled before NYC Token's plunge, with screenshots to illustrate, and users posted that they believed Adams had profited from the scheme.\n\n\"This has to be the fastest rug pull I've ever seen,\" said one user on X\n\nFor others, the sense of schadenfreude was strong as they watched meme coin investors caught in another high-profile collapse. The episode drew comparisons to Hawk Tuah coin, promoted by viral influencer Haliey Welch. The coin surged before losing 95% of its value shortly after its debut.\n\nA rug pull is usually defined as making a token effectively useless, which in memecoin land often means removing the liquidity needed for holders to sell,\" Haonan Li, founder of stablecoin merchant platform Codex, told Business Insider. That's what appears to have happened in Adam's case—the base layer of liquidity was pulled from the market.\"\n\nAdams could not be reached for comment. Representatives for the token's creators did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nCrypto data platform CoinGecko was still flagging the NYC Token as high risk on Wednesday. It posted the following disclaimer on the token's page:\n\n\"According to Rugcheck.xyz, there is a risk of market manipulation due to large concentration of tokens held in one or more unidentified wallets. Please use caution.\"",

    "fullText": "Customers of automated investment platform Betterment are being targeted with a cryptocurrency rewards scam following a data breach that allowed threat actors to obtain some user data and send fake emails promising huge returns on Bitcoin and Ethereum deposits.\n\nAccording to a Jan. 12 security update posted on Betterment's website (and sent to users via email), hackers gained unauthorized access on Jan. 9 to a third-party platform used for marketing and operations. Following the breach, they sent fraudulent messages to some customers with offers to triple crypto investments.\n\nThe scam emails were sent to Betterment users on Jan. 9, soon after the data breach, with subject lines like \"We'll triple your crypto!\" The message inside claimed that Betterment was \"giving back\" for a limited time and tripling Bitcoin and Ethereum deposits as large as $750,000 to specified wallets. Threat actors tried to create a sense of urgency with an expiration deadline for the promotion (a typical scam tactic).\n\nThe messages came from [email protected], which is a legitimate Betterment subdomain, allowing them to appear verified in users' inboxes. Note that this is the same email address Betterment used to send the security update to all of its customers.\n\nA nearly identical crypto scheme targeted Grubhub users in December with emails—also sent from a real Grubhub subdomain—promoting a 10x return on $1,000 in deposited bitcoin.\n\nCybercriminals were able to steal some customer information from the compromised system, including names, email addresses, mailing addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth. Betterment has said that no passwords or credentials were included in the breach, nor did threat actors gain access to user accounts. While few official details have been published, the company is reportedly being extorted as the target of the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.\n\nIf you're a Betterment customer, be wary of any unsolicited communication in the coming days and weeks about your account. Scammers will use events like this as a phishing opportunity. Know that Betterment (and other legitimate companies) will not request your password or other personal information via email, text, or phone call. If you are concerned about your account or want to update your credentials or other data, go directly to the website or app and do so there—this is generally safer than clicking links in communication, even if messages from Betterment are (or seem) legitimate.",

    "description": "A Satoshi-era Bitcoin miner reactivated long-dormant wallets to move 2,000 BTC, worth about $181 million, to Coinbase.",
    "fullText": "A Bitcoin miner from the network’s earliest days has emerged from dormancy to shift 2,000 BTC, a strategic profit-taking move valued at approximately $181 million.\n\nCryptoQuant's Julio Moreno noted that this represents the most significant activity by a \"Satoshi-era\" whale since late 2024.\n\nMoreno highlighted the timing of the transaction and observed that \"Satoshi-era miners [tend to] move their Bitcoin at key inflection points.\"\n\nAdding technical context, Sani, the founder of TimechainIndex, confirmed that the funds originated from block rewards mined in 2010. Notably, the blockchain network had rewarded early miners of that era with 50 BTC in block subsidies.\n\nThe coins had remained untouched for more than 15 years across 40 legacy Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK) addresses. They were later consolidated and transferred to Coinbase.\n\nTypically, market analysts interpret transfers to centralized exchanges as a prelude to an open-market sale.\n\nMeanwhile, this transaction is not an isolated anomaly but underscores a developing trend of \"vintage\" supply hitting the market.\n\nOver the past year, wallets from the 2009–2011 era have been increasingly reactivated across the Bitcoin network. The activity reflects early holders moving to lock-in gains or update long-standing custody arrangements.\n\nFor context, Galaxy Digital had executed one of the largest crypto sales in history by helping a Satoshi-era investor to sell more than $9 billion in July 2025.\n\nCrucially, the market has demonstrated remarkable resilience amid this selling pressure. Bitcoin successfully absorbed these large-scale \"OG\" supply shocks without suffering a breakdown in market structure.\n\nThis signals that while Bitcoin's early adopters are moving to lock in generational wealth, the market's liquidity remains deep enough to handle their exits.\n\nHowever, despite the immediate sell-side pressure from legacy holders, long-term institutional forecasts remain bullish.\n\nIn a report released last week, asset manager VanEck projected that Bitcoin could reach a theoretical valuation of $2.9 million per coin by 2050. The firm’s thesis relies on the asset’s potential adoption as a global settlement currency.\n\nRead original story Satoshi-Era Miner Moves Millions in Bitcoin After 15 Years of Silence by Oluwapelumi Adejumo at beincrypto.com",

    "description": "I asked ChatGPT to break it down for me, given the state of crypto. It made clear that its answer is \"a structured way to think about the opportunity and risk.\"",
    "fullText": "Cryptocurrency is either touted as the next big thing to make you rich or the riskiest investment ever. Yet despite its volatility and constant controversy, many investors continue to find ways to profit in the crypto space.\n\nIf someone realistically wanted to get rich via cryptocurrency in 2026, which one is most likely to make that possible, and how? I asked ChatGPT to break it down for me, given the current state of crypto. It made clear that its answer does not constitute financial advice, but rather “a structured way to think about the opportunity and risk.”\n\nChatGPT took a realistic look at what “getting rich” actually means in the crypto space. It was clear that it doesn’t mean “guaranteed 100% returns by New Year,” as the crypto market is extremely volatile, risky and speculative.\n\nRealistic goals might look like a 5% to 10% return on your core position — the main portion of your crypto portfolio held in more established assets like bitcoin or ethereum that you plan to keep long term. You might also see a larger potential return on a smaller “moonshot” allocation — a high-risk, high-reward investment in a newer or less proven coin that could spike in value but could just as easily wipe out, too.\n\nAnalysts place wide predictions even on the giants. For example, bitcoin (BTC) is forecasted to be valued between $100,000 and $200,000 in 2026.\n\nFind Out: 13 Cheap Cryptocurrencies With the Highest Potential Upside for You\n\nRead Next: 9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\n\nBased on current expert commentary and fundamentals, ChatGPT said there are two categories of coins with the best shot at making you rich across two strategies.\n\nUnsurprisingly, bitcoin (BTC), the most well-known coin, remains the leading choice. Many forecasts assume it will stay dominant. However, ethereum (ETH), the runner-up, is seen as more utility-based, and some analysts believe it may outperform BTC in certain phases.\n\nIn either case, these coins are less about “getting rich quick” and more about a reasonable chance of strong returns at moderate risk, the AI said.\n\nSome investors are turning to altcoins — smaller cryptocurrencies outside of bitcoin and ethereum — that could see bigger short-term gains. Coins like XRP and Solana are getting attention for their performance potential, though they come with higher risk, ChatGPT noted. Even newer projects, especially those combining AI and blockchain, promise sky-high returns, but most are highly speculative. Forecasts of 500% profits make headlines, but in reality, very few ever deliver.",

    "description": "If true, the claim could significantly reshape the global bitcoin market.",
    "fullText": "When Bitcoin first launched in 2009, many investors dismissed the currency as a fringe concept and even as a scam. (Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett’s former right-hand man at Berkshire Hathaway, memorably called it “stupid and evil.”) But the asset has skyrocketed in value in recent years and President Donald Trump labeled the currency “digital gold” after signing an executive order to create a strategic bitcoin reserve last January. Now, reports allege that Venezuela has bought into that “digital gold,” holding a “shadow reserve” nearly double that of the U.S.\n\nDigital publication Project Brazen reported Saturday that Venezuela could hold an estimated $60 billion worth of Bitcoin. Additional intelligence reports allege that ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his associates accrued Bitcoin via three channels: a gold swap overseen by Venezuelan Interior Minister Alex Saab in 2018, oil revenue priced in Bitcoin, and by seizing crypto mining equipment from miners in the country.\n\nSanctions have walled off the country’s access to financial markets for years, and experts allege that they may have motivated Venezuelan leaders to invest in cryptocurrencies to sidestep the barrier.\n\nBitcointreasuries.net puts Venezuela’s holdings at 240 bitcoin, worth nearly $22 million. The website sourced the data from a 2022 Forbes article that cited research from a blockchain analytics firm. The total is a far cry from the estimated U.S. holdings of 328,372, currently worth $30 billion, though the claim positions Venezuela’s holdings at nearly double the U.S. and one of the biggest holders of bitcoin globally.\n\nThe claims of Venezuela’s shadow Bitcoin holdings have predictably garnered skeptics, including digital asset financial services company Ledn Co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo, who grew up in Venezuela and whose family has mined crypto there since 2014.\n\nDi Bartolomeo finds no credibility in any of the three alleged sources of bitcoin income: the gold swap, oil exchange or mining equipment seizures. “This to me does not align with anything in the public record,” di Bartolomeo told Fortune. “There’s so much corruption, embezzlement and missing money that I don’t believe that any meaningful amount would have accrued.”\n\nHe outlined his full argument in a Coindesk op-ed piece titled “Don’t hold your breath for Venezuela’s bitcoin.” Though he notes that his family’s crypto mining materials were seized by the government in 2018 and returned five years later in a worn down condition, signaling heavy use of the equipment.",

    "fullText": "The crypto market was spared a blow this week after indexing giant MSCI opted not to delist crypto holding companies from its indexes.\n\nMSCI decided not to proceed with a proposal to exclude digital asset treasuries from its indexes, though it said it would conduct a wider review of how some companies are treated.\n\nThe move spares companies like Strategy and other firms whose main business is buying and holding crypto from a potentially devastating blow. If MSCI dumped those stocks, many investors who track its indexes would have likely followed suit. However, it leaves the door open to a crackdown in the future.\n\nStrategy stock spiked as much as 5% on the news.\n\nWhen the MSCI first said it was considering excluding firms with 50% or more assets in crypto, the idea sparked strong backlash from the industry. MSCI's argument was that crypto treasuries are more like investment funds than operating companies, and should be treated differently for the purposes of inclusion in some of its world indexes.\n\nFrank Chaparro, head of content at crypto market maker GSR, said that the updates is a subtle but important developement for the crypto market, which is still fragile following the market meltdown sent prices plummeting in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"As leverage unwound and sentiment around these structures deteriorated, weakness in DAT equities spilled over into broader crypto risk appetite,\" he told Business Insider. \"Against that backdrop, any credible bullish catalyst for the space, particularly one tied to index inclusion and institutional access, carries outsized signaling value right now.\"\n\nChaparro added that while many exchange platforms offer investors the opportunity to purchase crypto, the majority of traders still opt to gain exposure through funds and other index-linked products.\n\nThat said, MSCI signaled that it plans to embark on a broader consultation over how \"non-operating companies\" should be treated. Another bout of uncertainty related to indexing could create fresh headwinds for Strategy and other companies that hoard crypto on their balance sheets.\n\nChaparro said that he thinks this strong scrutiny on the part of the index is justified, highlighting the importance of holding DATs to high standards\n\n\"Companies that function more like investment funds than operating businesses with bitcoin as a core treasury asset should be evaluated differently and potentially excluded,\" he said. \"Clear and consistent criteria will be essential to preserve index integrity as these structures proliferate.\"",

    "fullText": "Ethereum’s staking queues have emptied out and the network can now absorb new validators and exits almost in real time.\n\nThis means the rush to lock up ETH has faded for now and staking is settling into a steady-state instead of a scarcity trade.\n\nQueues are simply the time spent to start or stop staking on the Ethereum network, acting as a sentiment gauge and a liquidity gauge.\n\nIn one sense, the lack of queues is a feature, not a bug, as these are proof Ethereum can handle staking flows without locking up liquidity for weeks.\n\nAt the same time, staking rewards have compressed toward 3% as total staked ETH grew faster than issuance and fee income, limiting incentives for renewed surges in either direction and leaving queues near zero even as overall staking participation remains elevated.\n\nLower yield can reflect crowding, but also a higher ‘trust premium’ — more ETH is choosing to sit in staking rather than on exchange order books.\n\nWhat this means in plain terms is that “staking pressure” is no longer a daily narrative.\n\nWhen queues are long, ETH supply is effectively being locked faster than the network can onboard validators, and that can create a sense of scarcity.\n\nWhen queues sit near zero, the system is closer to neutral. People can stake or unstake without waiting weeks, which makes staking feel less like a one-way door and more like a liquid allocation.\n\nThis changes the psychology around the ether trade.\n\nStaking still reduces immediate sell pressure, but it is not the same as coins being stuck. With withdrawals functioning smoothly, ETH behaves less like a forced lockup asset and more like a yield-bearing position that can be resized when sentiment shifts.\n\nOverall, Ethereum's staking supply is at around 30%, well below the 50% that Galaxy Digital predicted at the end of 2025. Expectations Galaxy had that ETH would sustain prices above $5,500 thanks to staking-induced supply shock, and that layer-2s would overtake layer-1s in economic activity, failed to materialize.\n\nEthereum’s DeFi TVL sits around $74 billion, well below its roughly $106 billion peak in 2021, even as daily active addresses have nearly doubled over the same period, according to DeFi Llama.\n\nThe network still accounts for close to 58% of total DeFi TVL, but that share masks a more fragmented reality.\n\nIncremental growth is increasingly being captured by ecosystems such as Solana, Base, and bitcoin-native DeFi, allowing activity to expand across the Ethereum orbit without translating into the same concentration of value or demand for ETH itself.",

    "fullText": "A new geopolitical conflict is unfolding. Yet, US stocks are… up at new record highs?\n\nThat's the dynamic on display on Monday as investors digest the US's raid on Venezuela and the capture of the nation's president, Nicolás Maduro, over the weekend.\n\nDespite the upheaval of its South American neighbor, US stocks, gold, and bitcoin were among risk assets that churned higher on Monday. As far as markets are concerned, the Venezuela situation seems to already be an afterthought.\n\nThe S&P 500 climbed 0.6%, while the Dow's 1.3% jump notched a record closing high for the benchmark. Energy stocks led the way across both indexes.\n\nThose moves seem counterintuitive, but they reflect a dynamic that markets have shown time and time again over the decades: investors simply don't care that much about conflict abroad.\n\nStocks, for one, have a pattern of falling as geopolitical tensions rise, but rebounding once the conflict actually occurs. According to an analysis by Fundstrat Research, there are at least five instances where equities rallied after a major geopolitical event, such as the first Gulf War or when Hamas attacked Israel in 2023.\n\n\"The old adage has long been to 'sell the rumor, buy the invasion,'\" Kent Fung, Fundstrat's vice president of market intelligence, wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\n\nPeter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research, said Monday's rally showed investors are more focused on taking the weekend's string of events in a \"positive light.\"\n\n\"You had a country that has been hostile to the US that has expropriated a lot of US investments, and now Trump has orchestrated a regime shift that could open the country up for new investment,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nThe lack of a negative reaction in markets could also reflect how investors can't yet price in a final outcome of the US-Venezuela conflict. The market also seems to be focused on other recent stock drivers, such as the rally broadening out to sectors beyond tech, Berezin said.\n\nThe market's upward momentum is proving to be a tough force to stop. US equities notched another record-setting year in 2025, with the S&P 500 gaining 16% as investors remained laser-focused on the growth potential of AI, strong earnings, rate cuts, and a still-resilient US economy.\n\n\"Solid results almost across the board\" last year have caused investor confidence to be \"reasonably strong,\" Nicholas Colas, the co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a note on Monday.\n\n\"From a mechanical standpoint, the global macro backdrop looks essentially unchanged,\" Karl Schamotta, the chief market strategist at Corpay, wrote in a note detailing how investors largely took the Venezuela situation \"in stride.\"\n\nIf anything, investors are more likely to care about the coming December jobs report, Schamotta added, which could influence the market's expectations for interest rate cuts in 2026.",

    "fullText": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin declared that the network has finally cracked blockchain’s fundamental trilemma through the combination of zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines and PeerDAS technology now running on mainnet.\n\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a decade-long technical journey that began with Buterin’s first data availability sampling commit in 2015 and early ZKEVM development around 2020.\n\n“These are not minor improvements; they are shifting Ethereum into being a fundamentally new and more powerful kind of decentralized network,” Buterin wrote in a post on X, describing how the protocol now delivers decentralization, consensus, and high bandwidth simultaneously, a feat previously considered impossible.\n\nButerin explained that early peer-to-peer networks faced stark limitations, with BitTorrent offering massive bandwidth and decentralization but no consensus mechanism.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin achieved decentralization and consensus at the cost of extremely low throughput due to replicated rather than distributed work.\n\nEthereum’s new architecture breaks this pattern by splitting computational work across nodes while maintaining cryptographic verification of all state transitions.\n\nZKEVMs have achieved production-quality performance, with proving times dropping from 16 minutes to 16 seconds and costs falling 45-fold, with 99% of Ethereum blocks now provable in under 10 seconds on target hardware.\n\nMeanwhile, PeerDAS enables nodes to verify data availability by sampling small portions rather than downloading entire blocks, dramatically expanding throughput without sacrificing decentralization.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation set a security-first roadmap requiring teams to achieve 128-bit provable security by the end of 2026, with intermediate milestones at 100-bit security by May 2026 and mandatory integration with the soundcalc security estimation tool by February.\n\n“If an attacker can forge a proof, they can forge anything: mint tokens from nothing, rewrite state, steal funds,” the foundation warned in December, emphasizing that performance gains cannot compromise cryptographic integrity.\n\nGeorge Kadianakis from the foundation’s cryptography team stressed the importance of securing architectures before they become moving targets.\n\n“Once teams have hit these targets and zkVM architectures stabilize, the formal verification work we’ve been investing in can reach its full potential,” he wrote, noting that recent advances in compact polynomial commitment schemes like WHIR and techniques such as JaggedPCS now make ambitious security targets achievable.",

    "fullText": "Just as we talked about why crypto could pump big this 2026 yesterday, Bitcoin price pushed up toward $90,000, while alts like Ethereum and XRP outperformed as BTC dominance slips under 60%. This somehow caught us off guard, especially after weeks of bearish sentiment heading into January.\n\nRefusing a breakdown, the market is running higher. Bitcoin jumped with 1% price gain, Ethereum with around 3%, and altcoins followed. XRP rallied close to 6%, easily beating major alts’ daily gains, and sentiment flipped a little after yesterday’s options expiry cleared the board.\n\nAt around 59%, Bitcoin dominance shows a start of a heavy rotation, just like popping popcorn. Capital is moving, Bitcoin price remains elevated, blasting $90,000, as we track a CME gap above the resistance level, which has a strong historical tendency to get filled.\n\n(source – BTC USD, CME gap, TradingView)\n\nDespite dominance slipping, Bitcoin stays resilient. On a weekly basis, it climbed by 2.5%, while the winner of last year, gold, slid more than 4% after peaking near $4,550. That divergence is the perfect example of rotation narrative as some capital is shifting from traditional hedges toward digital assets.\n\nLiquidity conditions also helped. The Federal Reserve injected nearly $19.5 billion through repo operations, one of the largest such moves since the Covid era. These injections might not grab headlines, but they support risk assets in the background, as can be seen in Bitcoin price action.\n\nDISCOVER: 10+ Next Crypto to 100X In\n\nA single whale (whom the community called an insider whale with a good hit rate) opened long positions worth more than $600 million in ETH, far outweighing exposure to Bitcoin price and Solana combined. The scale alone raised eyebrows, but the timing was perfect, as usual. With over 203,000 ETH in play, the bet implies expectations of further upside.\n\nThe Ethereum price held above $3,100, supported by good volume and volatility. ETH is leading this transition phase and benefited first from the market as Bitcoin dominance drifts lower. XRP followed with solid gains, and the altcoins’ market showed signs of life yet again.\n\nAway from the price action, what is happening in the macro structure is also worth watching. British stocks outperformed US markets since Donald Trump returned to office, challenging assumptions that American equities would immediately bump. UK indices have shown steadier strength, while US stocks have lagged despite policy optimism, as reported by BBC. Is Trump really the president we need in crypto?",

    "fullText": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said new privacy and data-handling technologies have effectively solved the blockchain’s long-standing scalability challenges.\n\nHowever, he cautioned that a full security rollout of these developments remains a few years away.\n\nIn a January 3 post on X, Buterin said Ethereum’s integration of zero-knowledge virtual machines has changed the network’s capabilities.\n\nHe added that the shift is driven by the pairing of ZK-EVMs with the data distribution method, PeerDAS.\n\n\"These are not minor improvements; they are shifting Ethereum into being a fundamentally new and more powerful kind of decentralized network,\" he stated.\n\nHe claimed this combination resolves the \"Blockchain Trilemma\"—the historic engineering difficulty of achieving decentralization, security, and high bandwidth simultaneously.\n\nButerin compared the upgraded architecture to a \"BitTorrent with consensus,\" contrasting it with Bitcoin’s model, which prioritizes decentralization but struggles with data throughput.\n\nWith the new upgrades, he noted, Ethereum can now handle data loads comparable to massive file-sharing networks while maintaining the security of a decentralized ledger.\n\n\"The trilemma has been solved - not on paper, but with live running code, of which one half (data availability sampling) is on mainnet today, and the other half (ZK-EVMs) is production-quality on performance today - safety is what remains,\" he argued.\n\nHowever, the roadmap for implementing this vision extends well into the future.\n\nWhile Buterin asserted that the technology has reached \"production-quality performance,\" he conceded that significant work remains to ensure the system's safety.\n\nAccording to his timeline, ZK-EVMs will not become the primary method for validating blocks until between 2027 and 2030. These systems will enable faster and cheaper transaction verification without exposing underlying data.\n\nIn the interim, the network plans to implement incremental upgrades.\n\nThis year, Buterin expects the gas limit to increase. New protocol developments would enable this by separating transaction proposers from block builders and expanding the amount of work each block can handle.\n\nLooking further ahead, Buterin outlined a goal for \"distributed block building.\" This is a system in which no single entity constructs a complete set of transactions.\n\nHe said distributing this authority reduces the risk of centralized censorship and ensures transactions are processed more evenly across regions.\n\n\"A long-term ideal holy grail is to get to a future where the full block is never constituted in one single place. This will not be necessary for a long time, but IMO it is worth striving for us at least have the capability to do that,\" Buterin wrote.\n\nThe technical pivot comes as Ethereum continues to face stiff competition from faster, lower-cost blockchains, pressuring developers to accelerate the deployment of these next-generation scaling solutions.\n\nRead original story Vitalik Buterin Claims Ethereum has Solved the Blockchain Trilemma Problem by Oluwapelumi Adejumo at beincrypto.com",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin ATM fraud reached new highs in 2025, with scammers reportedly stealing $333 million from victims, the FBI said.\n\nIn most cases of bitcoin ATM fraud, scammers impersonate either a company or a bank and flag supposed suspicious activity on the victim's account, advising them to deposit money into a bitcoin ATM to protect their funds or remedy the issue. That money then goes directly into the scammers' account.\n\nBitcoin ATMs have increased in popularity in the US, with over 30,000 machines in the States in 2024 — which is about 81.27% of the bitcoin ATMs in the world, according to finance news site Finance Magnates.\n\nThe FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) reported that more than 10,000 people were victims of bitcoin ATM-related fraud in 2025 alone.\n\n\"Based on IC3 reporting, data shows from January to November of 2025 there are over 12,000 complaints and over $333.5 million in monetary losses, an increase compared to the same time span last year,\" the FBI said in a statement emailed to Business Insider.\n\nIn 2024, the FTC reported that cryptocurrency scams in particular can be more financially devastating than other types of fraud. The report said that, midway through 2024, the median loss reported by individuals related to cryptocurrency fraud was $5,400. The median individual loss tied to reports of general fraud was $447.\n\nAnd the amount of money lost has been steadily increasing each year.\n\nData from the FTC shows that bitcoin ATMs accounted for $114 million in reported losses in 2023 and $78 million in losses in 2022, meaning reported losses due to bitcoin ATM fraud more than doubled in just two years.\n\nThe FTC urges people to pay close attention to any red flags when contacted by a bank or company by double-checking phone numbers and reaching out directly to companies that initiate contact with you. The agency also suggests slowing down and not feeling rushed because scammers often want a quick transaction.\n\nBitcoin has been used in other forms of fraud. The FTC advises that legitimate businesses and government agencies will not request bitcoin as a form of payment.\n\nWhile fraud does not only plague certain generations, older victims have been more susceptible to cryptocurrency crimes, the data shows.\n\nVictims 60 and over accounted for 71% of the reported losses using bitcoin ATMs during the first half of 2024, losing $46 million, according to the FTC.",

    "fullText": "Tax authorities are closing in on crypto tax evasion, and the net is widening beyond national borders. Beginning Jan. 1 in the U.K. and more than 40 other countries, exchanges must start collecting and reporting detailed trading records for local customers. This data can expose undeclared gains and, in some cases, help investigators trace suspicious flows. The change matters for the payments and FinTech ecosystem that connects bank accounts and cards to crypto platforms.\n\nIn a Jan. 1 report, the Financial Times said major cryptocurrency exchanges will be required to collect full transaction records for U.K. customers, including purchase price, sale price and profits, and to gather and report users’ tax residency information to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). The U.K. is part of an initial group of 48 jurisdictions implementing the OECD’s Cryptoasset Reporting Framework, or CARF, which sets a common format for reporting and sharing crypto trading data.\n\n“This is the beginning of the end for crypto investors who thought they could invest and gain from crypto in secrecy,” said Andrew Park, a tax investigations partner at Price Bailey.\n\nThe FT said that from 2027 HMRC will begin automatically sharing the information it receives with other participating tax authorities, including all EU countries, as well as jurisdictions such as the Channel Islands, Brazil, the Cayman Islands and South Africa. Overall, 75 countries have committed to implement CARF, with major crypto hubs including the UAE, Hong Kong, Singapore and Switzerland slated to join in 2027 and start exchanging data in 2028; the U.S. is expected to implement in 2028, with exchanges beginning in 2029.\n\nFor U.K. taxpayers, the FT noted that crypto taxes generally fall under capital gains rules, with profits above a £3,000 annual allowance taxable, although heavy buying and selling can be treated as trading and taxed as income with national insurance. HMRC has also opened a voluntary disclosure facility for undeclared gains made before April 2024 and trebled “nudge” letters to 65,000 suspected non-compliers in the 2024–25 tax year.\n\nPYMNTS’ recent reporting has tracked the fraud backdrop that regulators cite when they push for more transparency. PYMNTS covered the Justice Department’s new crypto scam “strike force,” aimed at organized networks tied to China. PYMNTS also reported on a Senate bill that would create a federal task force to combat cryptocurrency scams, and on an SEC case alleging a $14 million scheme that targeted retail investors. In separate coverage, PYMNTS noted that bitcoin ATMs and kiosks are increasingly used to route scam victims’ cash into digital wallets, making losses difficult to recover once funds are sent.\n\n: Scroll to Continue",

    "description": "A 2024 paper calculates $6.77B buys majority hash power. Bitcoin derivatives create profit incentives for block-reverting attacks.",
    "fullText": "Bitcoin’s security model rests on one assumption: attacking the network costs more than any attacker could gain. A 2024 paper by Farokhnia and Goharshady does the math on this assumption and finds it wanting.\n\nFor roughly $6.77 billion in hardware, an attacker could control over 50% of Bitcoin’s hash rate. With 30% of hash power, success probability exceeds 95% within 34 days at a cost of about $2.9 billion.\n\nThese are large absolute numbers, but relatively small: Bitcoin’s $1.78 trillion market cap and the monthly derivatives volume that now regularly exceeds $2 trillion on unregulated exchanges alone. The attack pays for itself if you short Bitcoin before crashing its price.\n\nThe paper challenges three assumptions the crypto community has treated as fact. (1) That you need 51% of hash power to attack successfully. Not true. With 30%, you have high probability of reverting six blocks, enough to shatter the six-confirmation finality standard most practitioners rely on. (2) Acquiring majority hash power is prohibitively expensive. It is expensive but represents less than 0.5% of Bitcoin’s market cap. (3) miners have no incentive to attack since they depend on BTC-denominated rewards. This ignores derivatives entirely.\n\nIn simple terms an attack would work like this: An attacker acquires put options or other shorting instruments on Bitcoin. They then use their hash power to mine secretly, building an alternative chain. When their chain exceeds the public chain in length, they publish it. The network switches to the longer chain. Transactions in the replaced blocks get reverted. Price crashes. The short position prints money.\n\nDavid Rosenthal, writing on his blog, offers a detailed skeptic’s view of whether this attack is actually feasible. His analysis is worth reading because he identifies practical obstacles the paper’s theoretical framework glosses over. Acquiring 43% of the pre-attack hash rate means buying roughly two years of Bitmain’s production capacity beyond what’s needed to replace obsolete equipment. The purchase would be noticed. Power requirements approach 9.5 gigawatts, roughly double what Meta’s planned Louisiana 5GW data center will need by 2030. That power doesn’t (yet) exist in deployable form.\n\nThe short position presents its own problems. Patrick McKenzie’s explainer on perpetual futures describes how crypto derivatives actually work: frequent settlements, margin requirements, liquidation risk. A leveraged short held for 34 days has high probability of getting liquidated before the attack succeeds, given Bitcoin’s volatility. In nine of twelve months in 2025, an initial 10X leveraged short would have been liquidated within the month. Even if the attack succeeds, the resulting crash would likely trigger automatic deleveraging, reducing winnings precisely when they should be largest.\n\nAn insider attack looks more plausible on paper. A large mining pool already controls the hash rate. The October 2025 liquidation event on crypto exchanges saw $19 billion in forced liquidations. This demonstrates both the volatility of the market and its capacity to absorb large directional moves. But an insider who stops contributing to the public chain for weeks becomes visible. The hash rate is public data. A 30% drop would trigger immediate investigation.\n\nThe paper’s contribution, in my opinion, is making explicit what the derivatives market implies: Bitcoin’s security depends not just on proof-of-work economics but on the assumption that attackers cannot profit from price crashes. That assumption gets weaker as the derivatives market grows. Monthly Bitcoin futures volume on unregulated exchanges has exceeded $2 trillion in recent months. The paper’s calculations used April 2024 data. Since then, Bitcoin’s hash rate has roughly doubled to around 1,100 EH/s, increasing attack costs proportionally. But derivatives volumes have grown too.\n\nThe next halving arrives in April 2028. Mining rewards drop to 1.5625 BTC per block. Miners whose equipment is fully depreciated might view an attack as an exit strategy, particularly if they can monetize it through derivatives. Some large miners are already pivoting to AI data center hosting, suggesting they see diminishing returns from mining alone. Core Scientific plans to exit Bitcoin mining entirely by 2028.\n\nWhat actually prevents this attack? Probably the practical difficulties Rosenthal identifies rather than any fundamental economic barrier. The market should price these risks but appears not to. Bitcoin trades as if 51% attacks are theoretical rather than economically viable. That may remain true as long as practical obstacles hold.\n\nHappy New Year!

    "fullText": "Bitcoin price enters 2026 stuck in the same buyer-seller fight that kept it muted through late 2025. The price is almost flat over the past 30 days, down about 0.6%, which shows how neither side has taken control.\n\nIt is still down about 7% year on year. This balance of pressure has turned into a stalemate. However, a 1% or even a 3.5% move from here could decide the next direction if the right conditions appear.\n\nBitcoin is trading inside a symmetrical triangle on the daily chart. This shape shows the market trapped between lower highs and higher lows, hinting at the buyer-seller tussle. Capital flows are not helping the upside.\n\nThe Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has trended lower since December 10. For the unversed, the CMF measures how much money flows into or out of an asset. It shows a bearish divergence now because the BTC price has trended higher between December 18 and December 31, while the CMF made lower lows. That signals continued outflows and selling pressure.\n\nWant more token insights like this? \n\nThis negative capital flow is being partially offset by exchange outflows.\n\nExchange net position change shows coins leaving exchanges. That often hints at accumulation. On December 19, exchange outflows were about 16,563 BTC. By January 1, they rose to 38,508 BTC.\n\nThat is an increase of about 132%. This push of coins leaving exchanges helps price stability and keeps the lower trendline of the triangle protected.\n\nSmart Money Index readings confirm the lack of direction. The Smart Money Index compares how larger, informed traders position versus the broader market. The line is hugging its signal line with no clear separation. That hints that larger traders are waiting for a breakout and not betting on either direction yet.\n\nUntil the breakout happens, the triangle stays neutral.\n\nThis matches what CMF and exchange flow data are saying. Outflows signal pressure. Exchange withdrawals signal support. Together, they cancel each other and hold the BTC price still. And even the most informed traders are unsure as to which side would win.\n\nThe cost basis heat map highlights clusters where many buyers last bought. These clusters often act like support or resistance. The nearest resistance zone is around $88,082 to $88,459, where about 200,035 BTC sit.\n\nBitcoin is trading near $87,480. A daily close roughly 1% higher would put the price above that zone. That could act as the first bullish trigger and settle the upper triangle break. On the BTC price chart, the level aligning with this cluster is $88,300, which needs to break first.",

    "description": "What is the biggest crypto news today? Ripple unlocks $1 billion in XRP as 2026 begins. Will re-locking limit real supply impact?",
    "fullText": "Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead.\n\nGrab a coffee and settle in. January is already shaping up to test the patience of XRP traders. While headlines are buzzing about Ripple’s $1 billion escrow unlock, the real story may lie less in the numbers and \n\nRipple is set to unlock 1 billion XRP from escrow on January 1, 2026, marking the first scheduled release of the new year.\n\nAt the current XRP price of $1.88, the headline figure represents roughly $1.9 billion, drawing attention from traders and analysts alike.\n\nYet, history suggests the market impact could be far smaller than the number implies. This is because Ripple’s monthly unlocks are part of a carefully managed supply mechanism rather than a surprise shock.\n\nThe escrow framework, established in 2017, is designed to enhance the transparency and predictability of XRP’s supply.\n\nUnder this schedule, Ripple releases 1 billion XRP each month but typically relocks between 60% and 80% of the tokens, retaining only a fraction for operational or liquidity needs.\n\nIn December 2025, for example, roughly 70% of unlocked XRP was returned to escrow, leaving less than 300–400 million XRP potentially liquid.\n\nIf January follows this pattern, traders may see a limited net supply increase despite the seemingly massive unlock.\n\nStill, the market watches closely. XRP is facing ongoing sell pressure, with a looming risk of a 41% crash. Yet, structural demand appears steady, seen with flows into US spot XRP ETFs.\n\nData on SoSoValue shows XRP ETFs have recorded over 30 consecutive days of inflows, including $15.55 million on December 30 alone. This raises total ETF-held assets to $1.27 billion.\n\nThese inflows highlight confidence in XRP’s long-term positioning among institutions, even amid short-term volatility.\n\nExchange balances add another layer to the supply story. Analysts note that XRP held on exchanges has declined from approximately 4 billion to under 1.5 billion over the past year, suggesting a tightening of the liquid supply.",

    "description": "As most of Donald Trump's crypto empire struggles, Trump Media Group announces new token launch to reward DJT shareholders.",
    "fullText": "Trump Media & Technology Group shareholders may be receiving a late Christmas gift shortly after the 2025 holiday season, though the exact date isn't clear.\n\nThe Truth Social parent has announced plans to issue a new crypto to its investor base. In a company statement released on Wednesday, December 31, the company revealed that it will distribute the token in partnership with Crypto.com and that it will operate on the Cronos blockchain.\n\nWhile the statement noted that Trump Media expects each DJT shareholder to receive one token for every share they hold, no specific timing has been provided yet. The company also said that those who receive these tokens may also be given rewards in the coming year, which may include discounts on company products.\n\nThis decision comes at a time when digital assets with ties to the Trump name have struggled significantly and are facing increasing scrutiny from both finance pros and investors. The Trump family lost roughly $1 billion in the recent crypto market meltdown, primarily due to bitcoin's steep decline and the $Trump meme coin falling sharply. American Bitcoin Corp, a company in which Eric Trump is a primary shareholder, has struggled significantly since its September IPO, falling 14% year-to-date.\n\nAs the crypto market continues to struggle, this new crypto offering, intended to reward Trump Media shareholders after a difficult year, may raise some questions. Haonan Li, founder of stablecoin merchant platform Codex, noted that it is entering the market at a less-than-ideal time.\n\n\"Projects like this are entering a much more skeptical market,\" he told Business Insider. \"Investors already have many ways to get crypto exposure, and spreading a strategy across multiple Trump-linked vehicles risks diluting demand rather than concentrating it.\"\n\n$Trump coin's recent performance may also raise concern, as it could be viewed as an indication of instability for the new crypto. The meme coin has fallen 14% over the past month. Meanwhile, the $MELANIA Trump meme coin plunged shortly after its launch in January 2025 and is down 94% for the year.\n\nLi also noted that the world of crypto is ever-changing and with it, the rules that drive the volatile market. In his view, the last crypto cycle was dominated by narratives, as real economic activity was constrained by regulation. But the market has shifted since then and the outlook is starkly different.\n\n\"The lines are blurring, but investors are far more discerning than last cycle, and simply copying what worked before will not be enough,\" he added.\n\nTrump's pro-crypto policies helped boost markets earlier in 2025 as investors viewed it as lending stability to the notoriously volatile asset class, cheering the easing of regulatory roadblocks. But with the year ending on a low note, it is unclear how a crypto created to reward shareholders in a struggling stock will be received.",

In this case, and for these Bitwise ETFs, this means up to 60% in the actual token (like AAVE) and the rest in other ETPs or derivatives that track that token’s price.\n\nThe 11 filings target: Aave (AAVE), Canton (CC), Ethena (ENA), Hyperliquid (HYPE), NEAR Protocol (NEAR), Starknet (STRK), Sui (SUI), Bittensor (TAO), Tron (TRX), Uniswap (UNI), and Zcash (ZEC).\n\nThere is no set date. The filings are the first step in a process that requires SEC review and approval, which can take several months and is not guaranteed. The funds would list on NYSE Arca if approved.\n\nRead also: Mirae Asset Group Pursues Major Crypto Foray with $100 Million Korbit Acquisition",

It serves as a full node client capable of validating and executing transactions, maintaining blockchain state, participating in peer-to-peer networking, and exposing APIs for user interaction.\n\nThis page provides a high-level architectural overview of the go-ethereum codebase, covering the major subsystems and how they interact. For detailed information about specific components, refer to:\n\nGo-ethereum implements the execution layer of Ethereum's post-merge architecture. It works alongside a consensus layer client (beacon node) to validate and produce blocks. The execution layer is responsible for:\n\nCommunication between layers occurs through the Engine API (eth/catalyst).\n\nSources: README.md1-257 eth/backend.go17-594 eth/ethconfig/config.go17-213\n\nThe geth binary starts at cmd/geth/main.go287 which initializes a CLI application using the urfave/cli framework. The default action invokes geth() at cmd/geth/main.go328 which performs three main steps:\n\nConfiguration Loading: loadBaseConfig() at cmd/geth/config.go142 reads CLI flags and TOML configuration files, producing a gethConfig struct containing node.Config, ethconfig.Config, metrics, and ethstats settings.\n\nNode Creation: makeFullNode() at cmd/geth/config.go223 creates a node.Node instance and registers the Ethereum service via eth.New() at eth/backend.go131\n\nNode Startup: startNode() at cmd/geth/main.go344 calls lifecycle methods to start all registered services.\n\nSources: cmd/geth/main.go217-416 cmd/geth/config.go51-340 eth/backend.go91-594\n\nThe central coordination point is the Ethereum struct defined at eth/backend.go92 which aggregates all major subsystems:\n\nSources: eth/backend.go91-594 cmd/geth/config.go222-311\n\nGo-ethereum uses a hierarchical configuration system supporting multiple input sources:\n\nConfiguration precedence (highest to lowest):\n\nThe gethConfig struct at cmd/geth/config.go107-112 contains three main configuration sections:\n\nSources: cmd/geth/config.go107-180 cmd/utils/flags.go81-1027 eth/ethconfig/config.go40-213\n\nGo-ethereum includes built-in configurations for multiple networks:\n\nNetworks are selected via CLI flags (--mainnet, --sepolia, --holesky, --hoodi) which set the appropriate ChainConfig from params/config.go\n\nSources: params/config.go29-427 cmd/utils/flags.go144-163\n\nThis sequence demonstrates how a transaction moves from user submission to block inclusion in the post-merge architecture:\n\nSources: miner/worker.go1-1820 eth/catalyst/api.go1-868 core/blockchain.go1-2500\n\nEvery Ethereum network starts from a genesis block defined by the Genesis struct at core/genesis.go57-76:\n\nThe ChainConfig at params/config.go433-494 defines the fork activation schedule:\n\nGenesis initialization occurs in SetupGenesisBlock() at core/genesis.go298-398 which:\n\nSources: core/genesis.go45-799 params/config.go428-494\n\nGo-ethereum uses a multi-layered storage system optimized for different data types and access patterns:\n\nState Database (core/state/statedb.go70-177): Provides transactional state access with:\n\nTrie Database (triedb/database.go): Manages Merkle Patricia Trie nodes with two schemes:\n\nSnapshot (core/state/snapshot): Flat account/storage representation for O(1) lookups:\n\nAncient Store (core/rawdb/freezer.go): Append-only storage for immutable historical data (blocks, receipts)\n\nSources: core/state/statedb.go1-1700 triedb/database.go1-600 core/state/snapshot1-1000\n\nGo-ethereum implements peer-to-peer networking for blockchain data exchange:\n\nSnap Sync (default, --syncmode snap):\n\nThe Downloader at eth/downloader/downloader.go coordinates sync across multiple peers with:\n\nSources: eth/downloader/downloader.go1-2000 eth/handler.go1-700 p2p/server.go1-1000\n\nGo-ethereum exposes multiple API interfaces:\n\nThe JSON-RPC implementation is in internal/ethapi with the EthAPIBackend at eth/api_backend.go providing access to blockchain state.\n\nSources: internal/ethapi/api.go1-2400 eth/api_backend.go1-400 node/api.go1-500\n\nPost-merge, go-ethereum operates in tandem with a consensus layer client. The Engine API (eth/catalyst/api.go) implements the execution engine specification:\n\nAuthentication uses JWT tokens specified via --authrpc.jwtsecret. The API listens on port 8551 by default (configurable via --authrpc.port).\n\nFor development, the SimulatedBeacon at eth/catalyst/simulated_beacon.go provides a standalone mode (--dev) that automatically produces blocks without an external consensus client.\n\nSources: eth/catalyst/api.go1-868 eth/catalyst/simulated_beacon.go1-400\n\nThe build system at build/ci.go supports:\n\nThe codebase requires Go 1.23+ and a C compiler (for certain dependencies like KZG commitments).\n\nSources: build/ci.go1-1000 README.md16-31 Makefile1-100\n\nGo-ethereum is a complex, production-grade implementation of the Ethereum execution layer. Its architecture separates concerns into distinct subsystems (state, blockchain, networking, consensus integration) while maintaining clear interfaces between components. The configuration system provides flexibility for different network deployments, and the post-merge Engine API enables seamless integration with any compatible consensus client.\n\nFor deeper exploration of specific subsystems, refer to the subsequent pages in this wiki covering Node Lifecycle, Core Components, Networking, Storage, and APIs.",

    "fullText": "Last few months of the year have seen $1tn in value wiped from the market, despite all-time-high price of bitcoin\n\nAs 2025 comes to a close, Donald Trump’s favorable approach to cryptocurrency has not proven to be enough to sustain the industry’s gains, once the source of market-wide optimism and enthusiasm. The last few months of the year have seen $1tn in value wiped from the digital asset market, despite bitcoin hitting an all-time-high price of $126,000 on 6 October.\n\nThe October price peak was short-lived. Bitcoin’s price tumbled just days later after Trump’s announcement of 100% tariffs on China sent shockwaves across the market on 12 October. The crypto market saw $19bn liquidated in 24 hours – the largest liquidation event on record. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, saw a 40% drop in price over the next month. Eric Trump’s own crypto company endured a similar drop in its value in December.\n\nIn Donald Trump, the crypto industry was delivered the pro-bitcoin president they were promised during his campaign. Within days of taking office for the second time, he issued an executive order that repealed restrictions on cryptocurrency and introduced new favorable regulations as well as a presidential working group on digital assets.\n\n“The digital asset industry plays a crucial role in innovation and economic development in the United States, as well as our Nation’s international leadership,” the order read. He placed cryptocurrency front and center in American policy.\n\nAgain in March, Trump announced a new strategic cryptocurrency reserve that fueled a 62% rally in the market prices of three out of five of the coins named to the reserve. Bitcoin, the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency, went up 10% to $94,164 in the hours after the reserve was announced.\n\nCryptocurrency is sensitive to both narratives and confidence in global markets, said Rachael Lucas, the head of marketing and communications at BTC Markets, Australia’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. It’s what is called a risk-on asset, an investment that does better when investors are feeling confident about the economy and are willing to take on more risk, Lucas said.\n\n“The Trump administration may be pro-crypto, but tariffs and tight monetary policy outweigh positive vibes,” said Lucas. “And it’s also just a reminder, especially for people in crypto, that macro forces really matter more than political stances.”\n\nIn November, bitcoin suffered its biggest drop in price since 2021, bringing the coin’s value to less than $81,000. While bitcoin regained some of that value in the weeks after, the digital token started December with another slump, dropping 6% after Strategy, the biggest holder of bitcoin, cut its earnings forecast because of the slide in crypto prices. Bitcoin’s price now hovers near $90,000, up from years past but significantly lower than its peak.\n\nIn the first few days of December 2025, Eric Trump’s crypto firm, American Bitcoin Corp, saw 40% of its value – roughly $1bn – wiped out.\n\nThe Trump family scion put on a bullish face and declared he would ride out the decline. “I’m holding all my @ABTC shares - I’m 100% committed to leading the industry,” Eric Trump said on X at the time.\n\nSome experts fear the industry is entering a so-called crypto winter, a prolonged period of stagnation or losses. The last time, crypto winter lasted from the end of 2021 through 2023, when the FTX mogul Sam Bankman-Fried was tried and convicted. Those years saw bitcoin slump 70% in price.\n\nDespite the optimism fueled by Trump’s win, the current market downturn shows the crypto-friendly administration wasn’t enough to usher in a return to the “retail mania” of 2021, when there was a huge upswing in individual stock trading, said Christian Catalini, the founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab.\n\n“The recent crash isn’t a change in sentiment, but a collision of three structural factors: the aftershocks of a $19bn leverage washout in October; a risk-off rotation driven by US-China tariff tensions; and, crucially, the potential unraveling of the corporate treasury trade,” Catalini said.\n\nAnother potential factor that may have shaken the crypto market is the downturn in share prices of AI stocks like Nvidia, said Lucas.\n\n“One of the reasons why bitcoin is tied to the AI cycle is because a lot of the bitcoin miners actually started leveraging their energy towards new datacenters,” she said. “Not only is crypto a technical asset, we have the miners actually tied into AI devices going up. That negative sentiment tends to sneak into crypto.”\n\nDespite concerns over a crypto winter, notable players in the crypto space Larry Fink, the CEO of investment management firm BlackRock, and Brian Armstrong, the co-founder of Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US, expressed optimism about the long-term value of the currency at a recent New York Times conference. Armstrong said “there was no chance” the price of bitcoin would go to zero and in fact 2025 would be seen as the year “when crypto went from gray market to a well-lit establishment”. Fink, for his part, said his firm had observed “legitimate long owners investing in the currency”, including sovereign wealth funds.\n\nLucas said that this downturn in crypto prices was not inconsistent with past four-year bitcoin cycles and that she was not worried about entering a much more sustained crypto winter.\n\n“If I was looking at it from a traditional bitcoin cycle, we are actually technically in a bear market,” said Lucas. “But as you can see, even with all of these macros that are affecting the market, bitcoin has still managed to set a price above $80,000.”",

    "fullText": "Crypto investment products continue to see outflows towards the end of the year.\n\nBitcoin led the outflows in the past week, while Solana and XRP continue to see inflows for another week.\n\nThe weekly flows indicate a cautious approach by investors.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have continued to experience massive outflows towards the end of the year.\n\nAt a time when BTC and ETH investment products continue to see outflows, Solana and XRP ETFs have maintained their market-defying momentum, recording their most significant weekly inflows since inception.\n\nCrypto investment products saw outflows of $446 million last week, bringing total outflows since the October 10th shock price decline to $3.2 billion.\n\nDespite the recent drawdown, year-to-date inflows remain robust at $46.3 billion, slightly below 2024’s $48.7 billion, while total assets under management (AUM) are still up 10% YTD.\n\nBitcoin investment products accounted for the bulk of last week’s outflows, shedding $443 million, while Ethereum products followed with $59.5 million in outflows.\n\nIn contrast, newer products continued to attract capital. Solana and XRP ETFs both posted their strongest weekly inflows since launch, defying the broader trend.\n\nXRP ETFs recorded $79 million in net inflows, while Solana ETFs added more than $7.5 million.\n\nThe divergence suggests investor confidence is becoming increasingly selective, with capital rotating toward XRP and Solana exposure even as funds continue to exit Bitcoin and Ethereum products.\n\nExamining the weekly flow of crypto investment products, investors remain cautious about the value of BTC and ETH heading into the end of the year.\n\nBTC’s price reclaimed $90,000, while the ETH price climbed above $ 3,000.\n\nHowever, like several past instances since October, both tokens failed to sustain the bullish momentum and lost all of their gains within hours of breaking past key resistance.\n\nOn the other hand, altcoin spot prices remain in the bearish zone; however, due to the recent launch of these products, investors are more open to taking risks with them, as evident from XRP’s zero outflow days, while Solana has seen key inflows from time to time.\n\nThe United States remains the hub of most flows, owing to the launch of some of the largest ETF products in the country.\n\nGermany’s inflows suggest opportunistic buying during market dips, while the US dominated the negative flows.\n\nThe post Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs Continues Outflows While Solana and XRP Record Largest Inflow appeared first on ccn.com.",

Also read up on how North Korean hackers were responsible for over $2 billion in crypto losses in 2025.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime.\n\nThe FTC estimated that Americans lost 12.5 billion dollars to scams in 2024. That was a 25% increase from a year earlier. and in 2025 attacks are growing in scope and scale, even taking advantage of trusted sites like LinkedIn. One company trying to protect consumers is Push security. Mark Orlando, Push's chief technology officer joins me now. Mark, it is great to see you. So so maybe start here Mark, you know, as the year draws to a close, we're rolling into 2026, Mark. What what is the big\n\ncybersecurity themes, Mark, we should be aware of. What what are the big trends? Scale, for example, seems to be one you're highlighting.\n\nHi Josh, absolutely. Scale is uh really one of the biggest developments that we've seen not only this year but in the last few years, as the infrastructure behind these types of attacks gets easier and easier to stand up and operate. I think we can expect the scale of these attacks to continue growing exponentially. We've also seen the sophistication of these attacks uh really getting getting higher and higher. Uh you mentioned exploiting\n\nlegitimate sites and services like LinkedIn, um but we're seeing that across the board, whether it's social media networks or uh sponsored ads in Google results, attackers have come up with some very creative and sophisticated ways to deliver these scams and these attacks to unsuspecting users.\n\nIt sounds like, Mark, you're also highlighting how more attacks are are happening inside the browser. Why is that, Mark? I mean, just technically technically speaking, how does that how does that help the attacker?\n\nSure, well the browser has really evolved from a tool that we use to view web pages to, you know, essentially a platform that runs software on demand. I mean, this is where, you know, work really happens these days including, you know, where users are logging into all of the various accounts and services that we use on a daily basis. So, uh attackers realized this and they have kind of shifted away from uh different areas of the network like email uh or, you know, strictly web access that are fairly well defended into the browser, which is somewhat\n\nless well defended, certainly an area where most organizations don't have great visibility into what's going on and how users are interacting with websites. So, attackers have realized this, they've shifted focus to doing \n\nYou also highlight here, Mark, uh what sound like these LinkedIn-based fishing attacks. explain those, Mark, how do they work?\n\nSure. So, I think historically when you talk about fishing or email scams, I mean it is strictly that. It's something that's coming through email. and I think more or less that's what users have come to expect. if they're going to get scammed, it's going to be some, you know, poorly worded kind of suspicious email that comes in with an attachment or a link. And really that's uh increasingly no longer the case. So, uh you mentioned LinkedIn, we identified an attack campaign uh earlier this year where\n\nuh a an executive, a CEO in fact, uh of a company we work with was targeted through LinkedIn. He received a message from someone in his network, a first-level connection uh about something that was very relevant to that company and to his work. And so uh he clicked on the link, you know, along the lines of hey, check out this investment information, this opportunity, let me know what you think. Uh there was a lot of kind of sophisticated um\n\nkind of hoops he had to jump through to validate that it was in fact, uh him who was accessing the attacker website. and ultimately the goal was uh to gather his login information. So, in fact, it wasn't the trusted contact that had sent this message through LinkedIn, but rather someone else who had compromised his contact's uh account. So, this is a a situation where not only is the message very, very convincing, but it comes from a a trusted source, in this case, you know, a trusted known contact.\n\nSo, very, very difficult to pick out. and again, very difficult for an organization to see what's happening inside of those LinkedIn communications, much less do anything to stop it.",

    "fullText": "Looser monetary policy, with lower interest rates and quantitative easing, can drive demand for Bitcoin as investors seek higher returns.\n\nThere is a lot of fear, uncertainty, and doubt about quantum computing's impact on Bitcoin, worries that appear to be overblown.\n\nBitcoin has historically bounced back after down years.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Bitcoin ›\n\nAccording to data from asset manager BlackRock, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has produced a higher return compared to every other asset class in eight of 11 years from the start of 2013 through 2023. Bitcoin was then up 119% in 2024.\n\nThat hot streak is about to end this year, with the top digital asset declining 7% in 2025 (as of Dec. 23). At the same time, the S&P 500 index has produced a total return of almost 18%, marking its third straight year of double-digit percentage gains.\n\nMaybe next year will be better for Bitcoin. Is the world's dominant cryptocurrency positioned to bounce back and outperform the market in 2026?\n\nIn September 2024, the Federal Reserve decided to cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time since it raised the rate in July 2023. After this, the central bank conducted five more rate cuts. Generally speaking, declining interest rates are a boon for risk assets, a group that includes Bitcoin. From an investor's perspective, lower yields in fixed income products are not as attractive, leading to a greater focus on assets that could earn higher returns. These rate cuts are also accommodative to the economy, which can drive revenue and earnings growth for companies, in turn supporting higher valuations and stock prices.\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. central bank has effectively started quantitative easing (QE), having announced plans to purchase $40 billion of Treasury Bills each month. The last time QE started was on March 15, 2020, to jump-start the economy after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the subsequent 12 months, Bitcoin soared more than 1,000%.\n\nLower interest rates and QE provide a very favorable environment in which more liquidity gets pumped into the financial system. Bitcoin, as a global macro asset, is definitely affected by this. Investors can look at two key metrics to watch this trend: federal debt and M2 money supply. Both have rapidly expanded in the recent past, with no reason to believe they shouldn't do the same in 2026.\n\nThe macroeconomic situation looks to be working in Bitcoin's favor as we set our sights on the new year.\n\nBased on its historical average, the S&P 500 generates an annualized 10% total return. If this is what happens in 2026, then Bitcoin has a very low hurdle rate to clear in order to outperform the benchmark index. In addition to the macro forces already mentioned, there are two reasons the leading cryptocurrency is poised to do extremely well next year.",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin had a baby! Ethereum was born! And the Ethereum price is finally rebounding, up 3.9% over the last week.\n\nMoreover, year-end fate is about to be decided by derivatives, not headlines. Roughly $6 Bn in ETH options expire Friday, and despite call options outnumbering puts by more than 2.2 times, the structure still favors bears unless price can reclaim key levels fast. Here’s what to know:\n\nETH has failed to hold above $3,400 for more than 40 days, a stretch that has steadily drained bullish conviction. Most calls were placed between $3,500 and $5,000, reflecting expectations that Ether would close 2025 near $4,000 before the 28% November drawdown shattered that thesis.\n\nAs a result, more than $4.1 Bn in call options are now at risk of expiring worthless.\n\nDISCOVER: Top 20 Crypto to Buy in 2025\n\nPut positioning is more grounded. Bears clustered protection between $2,200 and $2,900 levels. If ETH settles between $2,700 and $2,900, puts win by roughly $580 Mn.\n\nEven a $2,901 to $3,000 close still favors bears by $440 Mn. Bulls only reach parity above $3,100, with a modest $150 Mn advantage emerging above $3,200.\n\nDerivatives flows explain the chop for the Ethereum price. ETH has hovered around $3,000 while dealers hedge exposure, keeping spot pinned inside a narrow band. If price holds above $2,950, more than 60% of $1.9 Bn in puts expire worthless, easing downside pressure but not flipping the trend outright.\n\nDISCOVER: Next 1000X Crypto: 10+ Crypto Tokens That Can Hit 1000x in 2025\n\nEthereum options activity shows traders rolling exposure into late-2025 and 2026 expiries rather than loading up on shorts for this week. Similar positioning appeared in mid-2023 and early 2024 before delayed breakouts materialized.\n\nMacro stress is adding caution. Additionally, weakness in US semiconductor manufacturing and softer AI-linked optimism have pushed traders toward hedges like bear put spreads and bear call spreads after repeated failures at $3,400.\n\nThe upshot is this: you are the Christmas miracle, Anon. You’re a beautiful and caring person and you have people who love you. Oh, and this week will be big for the ETH price; expect volatility.\n\nEXPLORE: Singapore Denies Do Kwon’s $14M Refund Demand For ‘Stolen’ Penthouse\n\nRead original story $6B Options Expiry Weighs on Ethereum Price by Isaiah Mccall at 99bitcoins.com",

    "fullText": "Nikhil Kamath, a renowned Indian billionaire, recently told CoinDCX CEO Sumit Gupta that he does not have a single Bitcoin to his name nor has he ever invested in other crypto. He clarified that he was not so familiar with the concept of cryptocurrencies, even though he interacts with some of the top players within the blockchain industry.\n\nDuring Kamath’s conversation with Gupta, the billionaire and co-founder of Zerodha hinted at his interest to pursue BTC by 2026, even though he has never owned Bitcoin before now. As someone who claims to have less knowledge about Bitcoin and other digital currencies, he says that he is open to learning about the space and exploring it further.\n\nThis revelation was made when CoinDCX CEO sought to know about Kamath’s views on blockchain and Bitcoin. His response may have come as a surprise to many people considering that Kamath has conversed with top leaders on his WTF podcast.\n\nThis includes top industry players like Elon Musk, Nandan Nilekani, Ruchir Sharma, Ray Dalio and many more.\n\nInterestingly, a handful of these entities are focused on blockchain and crypto, but it appears that Kamath did not tap from that aspect of their knowledge. He unashamedly admitted the limitation of his knowledge on the subject.\n\nDuring one of his podcasts with Musk, the Tesla boss equated Bitcoin with “energy,” which he believes to be the “true currency.”\n\nSome entities suspect that Kamath may just be taking a cautious stance on the subject of crypto, especially considering India’s position with digital assets. India once stated that it has no plans to regulate the crypto sector for now, citing concerns that it could expose the country’s financial system to risks.\n\nThe authorities in the region have agreed that a complete ban could tackle speculative activities, but at the same time, it wouldn’t prevent peer-to-peer transfers or decentralized trading.\n\nOn one hand, India has become more lenient towards the burgeoning crypto industry in recent months. Last October, Coinbase Global Inc., an American cryptocurrency exchange strengthened its presence in India and the Middle East by making a major investment in CoinDCX. This came 3 years after the same exchange exited the country.\n\nRead original story Indian Billionaire Nikhil Kamath Eyes Bitcoin Exposure in 2026 by Godfrey Benjamin at Coinspeaker.com",

    "fullText": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nMarket commentator and popular media personality Jim Cramer may be advocating for Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) these days, but not long ago, he completely wrote off cryptocurrency as an investment.\n\nThe stunning collapse of the FTX exchange during the fall of 2022 triggered a “Crypto Winter,” dragging Bitcoin to a low of $16,000. The exchange’s bankruptcy and subsequent arrest of Sam Bankman-Fried rocked the market, just a year after it had celebrated new highs.\n\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nWall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n\nIn this backdrop, Cramer appeared on CNBC on Dec. 23, stating that the faith of the American people has been shaken.\n\n“I sold all my crypto. I announced everything on TV, what I did with crypto,” the “Mad Money” host said. “I wouldn’t touch crypto in a million years.”\n\nCramer also took a dig at those who put their coins on unregulated trading platforms.\n\n“If you have your money in any of those, look, I’m not calling you an idiot. I’m just saying you’re using a lot of blind faith,” he said.\n\nTrending: Forget Flipping Houses—This Fund Lets You Invest in Home Equity Like Wall Street Does\n\nBitcoin traded at $16,796 when Cramer made these remarks.\n\nFast forward three years, and the apex cryptocurrency is worth $86,805 apiece, marking a whopping return of 416%. So, if you adopted the \"Inverse Cramer\" strategy, you’d be laughing all the way to the bank today.\n\nNote that there has been no definitive proof of this being a profitable strategy. So DYOR.\n\nPrice (Recorded on Dec. 23, 2022)\n\nPrice (Recorded at 11:45 p.m. ET)\n\nSee Also: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nIt's worth pointing out that while Bitcoin has thrived in a broader three-year timeframe, its fortunes have declined more recently.\n\nThe apex cryptocurrency has wiped out all of its 2025 gains in the ongoing slump, and currently trades 31% below its all-time highs.\n\nMeanwhile, Cramer sounds more like a Bitcoin fan today. Last week, he said that he just wants Bitcoin, not any derivative or Bitcoin treasury companies.\n\nEarlier in the year, he advocated for Bitcoin as a hedge against the escalating U.S. national debt, stating that he was buying a lot himself.",

    "fullText": "Like many of his US counterparts, the Russian science prodigy turned hugely successful ‘digital populist’ has a deep suspicion of government constraint\n\nTech visionary, Kremlin dissident, FSB agent, free speech absolutist, health guru. These are just some of the labels admirers and critics have attached to Pavel Durov over the past decade.\n\nThe Russian-born tech entrepreneur founded Russia’s version of Facebook before going on to create the messaging app Telegram, launch a cryptocurrency ecosystem and amass a multibillion-dollar fortune, all while clashing repeatedly with authorities in Russia and beyond.\n\nBut much of Durov’s real story – and the logic that drives him – remains obscured.\n\nA new biography aims to change that.\n\nThe Populist, by the independent Russian writer Nikolay Kononov, traces the 41-year-old’s rise from a St Petersburg schoolboy science prodigy to the founder of Telegram, one of the world’s most influential communications platforms, which has more than a billion users.\n\nKononov describes the book as the product of a 14-year attempt to map Durov’s strategy and mindset, drawing on conversations with Durov himself and people who worked with him, as well as rivals and critics.\n\nThe book’s title, he said, refers to a thread running through Durov’s life: his desire to address Telegram’s millions of users directly, allowing him to bypass institutions, the press and any system of representation.\n\n“Durov is one of the first digital populists,” Kononov said in an interview, explaining that “from the very beginning, as soon as he started making his digital products, he programmed into them the ability to write and communicate his ideas directly to his audience.”.\n\nBoth VKontakte, Durov’s first venture, and Telegram have at times pushed messages from Durov directly to all users, including users who had not opted in, outlining his libertarian worldview.\n\n“He sees himself as a visionary. And obviously wants to be heard,” the author said.\n\nThat strategy has helped promote Durov’s central promise – almost absolute freedom of expression – even as Telegram has become a go-to tool for dissidents, extremists, scammers and war propagandists.\n\nIf Durov’s public brand is built on libertarianism, Kononov says his private management style points in the opposite direction: power concentrated in one man’s hands, with few visible checks.\n\n“He is essentially the only one making all the product decisions at Telegram,” Kononov said. “Marketing, PR – it’s a one-man show.”\n\nThe portrait he draws is of a tech founder whose worldview has not wavered over the years, remaining most comfortable within an ultra-libertarian, anti-institutional strand of the right that is often misogynistic and, at times, conspiratorial.\n\n“What surprised me most is that Durov hasn’t changed or evolved in all the years that I have interviewed him,” Kononov said.\n\nDurov is not an outlier, Kononov writes, but part of a broader new wave of moguls – most visibly in the US – who pair technological dominance with an outsized sense of personal mythology and a deep suspicion of government constraint.\n\nLike Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Jeff Bezos, he has shown a strong interest in longevity science as well as pronatalism, the belief that having as many children as possible is a social or civilisational duty.\n\nDurov does not drink or use drugs, Kononov says, regularly dispenses spartan health advice – often alongside photos of him shirtless – and has said he has fathered dozens of children through sperm donation.\n\nOne of the book’s most striking sections tells for the first time of Durov’s tense early meeting with President Vladimir Putin in 2014, held behind closed doors.\n\nKononov writes that Durov described the encounter as a one-way conversation, in which the Kremlin leader reprimanded him over illegal content on Vkontakte and suggested that Durov leave the country.\n\nUnder pressure from the authorities, Durov sold his stake in Vkontakte, left Russia and eventually settled in Dubai, where he founded Telegram.\n\nBut the clearest mark on Durov in recent years, Kononov suggests, came not from Russia but from France.\n\nDurov, who also holds French citizenship, was detained and held for three days in France in August last year as part of an investigation into crimes linked to Telegram, including the circulation of child sexual abuse images, drug trafficking and fraudulent transactions.\n\nHis detention came as a shock to the tech mogul. In interviews conducted in Paris after his arrest, Durov described to Kononov a harsh, disorienting ordeal – a permanently lit cell and little sleep – that rattled a man who had spent years insulating himself from the reach of the state.\n\nIt also appears to have sharpened his hostility towards the west. Kononov says Durov now frames Europe as sliding toward “total digital control”, and increasingly conspiratorial rhetoric.\n\nMost recently, Durov appeared to endorse a conspiracy theory promoted by the far-right blogger Candace Owens, suggesting that Paris was behind the killing of Charlie Kirk.\n\n“What interests me about Durov is that, on the one hand, he clearly has a very high IQ,” Kononov said. “But at the same time, he is prone to conspiracy theories.”\n\nKononov is adamant, however, that Durov’s views should not be conflated with formal political allegiances.\n\nOne of the most persistent claims surrounding Durov is that he is secretly aligned with Russian security services.\n\nBut Kononov said that in the course of his research, he found no evidence that Durov has worked with, or on behalf of, the Russian state. “He has a huge number of flaws – but not the sin of Telegram acting as a backdoor for the FSB,” Kononov said.\n\nKononov argues that what Durov has ultimately learned is the need to compromise – with both Russian and western authorities – when it serves his interests and allows Telegram to continue operating.\n\nKononov recalls Durov once telling him: “I never waste time on things that are unnecessary or that cannot be useful to me personally.” That self-serving mindset, Kononov said, ultimately ended their personal relationship.\n\nAbout a year ago, the writer asked Durov whether he saw a contradiction between Telegram’s highly centralised, almost authoritarian internal structure and his professed devotion to freedom of expression. After that, Durov stopped responding.\n\n“He quickly realised it wasn’t going to be a book to his liking,” Kononov said.",

And so what is that telling you about what we should be watching and where it could be going in 2026?\n\nWell, just from a pure technical standpoint, we're sort of trying to scrape our way back over the 200-day moving average if we're looking at Bitcoin, and that would be a move over 91,000. I think that would be a sigh of relief to the balls.\n\nAnd if we break down under 85, obviously that would be some trouble.\n\nAnd what's interesting about the technicals right now, Julie, is that it's perfectly coinciding with the biggest news that could impact in uh Bitcoin right now, which is that MSCI and uh possibly the S&P 500 and the FTSE are all talking about the potential of removing strategy, Micro strategy, um Michael Sailor's company from the listing uh on the S&P 500\n\nthat fate could be decided as soon as January 15th. That would have tremendous implications because essentially, and and by the way, when that news came out, that's where we started to see the top.\n\nThat would have the implication would be first of all, a cash removal of 8 to 9 billion dollars for one, but more importantly perhaps, is that all this mass adoption that we just talked about would now come into question as institutional investors would basically be rejecting it.\n\nNow, this is very political, some people will say. Goldman Sachs behind it, they may have some reasons, uh it may not even go through, but I think it's something you have to watch.\n\nSo coiled spring. If it doesn't go through, I think we'll see a massive rally and if it does, that 65,000 may may not even hold.",

    "description": "Cryptocurrency Exchange Architecture is the framework of a crypto platform, ensuring efficient trade matching, secure wallets, liquidity handling, and smooth user interaction for reliable trading",
    "fullText": "Cryptocurrency exchange architecture forms the foundation of every trading platform, determining how trades are executed, funds are secured, and users interact. In 2026, with over 200 active exchanges globally and centralized platforms like Binance handling nearly 40% of the world’s spot trading volume, having a secure, scalable, and high-performance architecture is more important than ever.\n\nAs the crypto ecosystem evolves, exchange platforms are adopting new technologies, from hybrid and decentralized models to advanced security protocols and automated liquidity management. These innovations ensure faster transactions, enhanced user experience, and regulatory compliance, positioning modern exchanges to meet the demands of both retail and institutional traders.\n\nIn this blog, we’ll explore the latest trends, core components, and architectural advancements shaping cryptocurrency exchanges today.\n\nCryptocurrency exchange architecture is the technical blueprint of an exchange, defining how the trading engine matches orders, how funds are stored, and how users interact. Leveraging scalable engines, real-time order books, and intuitive frontends, a well-designed architecture ensures fast, secure, and compliant operations, supporting both high-volume traders and everyday users in a reliable, seamless environment.\n\nWhen built well, this architecture makes the exchange fast, secure, and dependable. Conversely, poorly designed architecture can lead to downtime, security vulnerabilities, or slow, frustrating user experiences, issues that can quickly harm an exchange’s reputation in today’s competitive market.\n\nTo understand how exchanges are built, here are the primary building blocks:\n\nAny exchange revolves around the trading or matching engine. It pairs buy and sell orders according to the rules such as price-time priority. The engine also needs to be able to process millions of orders in a second with a small latency in the high-performance systems. As an example, the matching engine of Binance can handle very large throughput\n\nLiquidity is the capacity to sell or purchase assets very easily without any major alterations in prices. Trades employ various liquidity designs: centralized order books with designated market makers, on-chain liquidity books (in the case of DEXs), or hybrid. The architecture should facilitate effective access to liquidity, potentially with a combination of several sources.\n\nThe manner in which an exchange manages user money is of the essence. Other exchanges are custodial (they custody user wallets), non-custodial (the user retains control with private keys). Hybrid models may allow both. The wallet architecture also determines the nature of handling deposits, withdrawals, and cold/ hot storage in a secure way.\n\nOrder book records outstanding buys/sell orders. Exchanges can be on-chain (occasionally deployed on pure DEX), off-chain or in-memory. The structure of the order book has an impact on performance, transparency and security.\n\nIt has no compromise on security: It includes authentication (KYC, 2FA), fund security (Multi-sig, cold storage), smart contract audits (DEX), and resistance to trading risks, such as front-running, MEV, or DDoS. These security layers should be in-built in the architecture.\n\nTrade is made easy, responsive and trustworthy with the good front end. The UX should receive order placement, charting, account and wallet connections, and give real-time feedback.\n\nA robust admin panel allows operators to monitor trades, manage liquidity, configure markets, and handle risk. Modern exchanges also include crypto exchange APIs for automated tools, third-party integrations, and liquidity management, essential for scalability in turnkey deployments.\n\nIn particular, the fiat on-ramps and off-ramps (banks, payment processors) come in handy, especially when it comes to centralized exchanges. The architecture should be equipped with trustworthy and secure payment systems to exchange crypto and fiat.\n\nThere are various types of cryptocurrency exchange that have their own architecture, features, advantages, and trade-offs. Knowing such types assists the user, the developer and investors to assess performance, security and usability.\n\nCentralized exchanges operate on a traditional client-server model, where the platform manages user accounts, wallets, and order matching. Trades are executed through a central server, which allows for high-speed transactions, deep liquidity, and fiat integration. Such are Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. As convenient and quick to trade, CEXs force the user to leave their money in the hands of the platform to be hacked.\n\nDEXs run on blockchain networks and smart contracts, enabling peer-to-peer trading without a central authority. Users keep control over their money decreasing counterparty risk. Liquidity is dealt with by order books or automated market makers (AMMs). These are Uniswap and dYdX. DEXs are more transparent, secure, and decentralized, although they can be slower in their transactions and have more expensive network charges than CEXs.\n\nHybrid exchanges are built on the combination of CEXs and DEXs features to provide both speed and liquidity with the added non-custodial security. Ordinarily, the way an order matching is conducted is off-chain and then settled on-chain. This is the most optimal solution because it offers the speed of trading, lower charges and enables users to have greater control over funds. The hybrid models are becoming popular to bridge between centralized convenience and decentralized trust.\n\nP2P exchanges connect buyers and sellers directly, allowing them to trade crypto using local currencies or payment methods. The platform usually serves as an escrow service to brush off transactions and fraud. They are Paxful and LocalBitcoins. P2P exchanges offer more options in payment, privacy, and accessibility particularly where banking infrastructure is least developed but might lack liquidity compared to the CEXs.\n\nThe exchange is driven by the backend which deals with trades, liquidity and wallet security, and the front end is to be used to provide the user with a clean, user-friendly interface. The two provide a combination of fast, reliable and safe trading.\n\nCryptocurrency exchange architecture shapes how modern trading platforms operate, from order matching and liquidity flow to wallets, user dashboards, and backend systems. As centralized, decentralized, hybrid, and P2P models grow, the right architectural approach helps ensure smooth trades, consistent performance, and a better trading experience for users.\n\nWith emerging trends like AI-driven trading, Layer 2 networks, cross-chain functionality, and enhanced UX/UI, exchanges are evolving to meet the expectations of both retail and institutional traders. When platforms prioritize strong design, dependable performance, and regulatory alignment, they establish trust and remain competitive in a rapidly evolving market.\n\nIn this landscape, cryptocurrency exchange development is about building a foundation that can adapt to new technologies and industry demands. A well-structured architecture doesn’t just run a platform , it supports long-term growth and shapes the future of your exchange .just run a platform , it supports long-term growth and shapes the future of your exchange.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI is the latest to make a political hire as big tech spreads its tentacles around the world. So what’s the attraction?\n\nGeorge Osborne getting a new job isn’t exactly news. Since leaving frontline politics, the former chancellor has served as the chair of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, edited (not entirely successfully) the Evening Standard, advised asset manager BlackRock, joined boutique advisory firm Robey Warshaw, been appointed as the chair of the British Museum and taken on roles including advising crypto firm Coinbase. Oh, and like any white man of a particular age, he co-hosts a political podcast.\n\nBut Osborne’s latest job is the most eye-opening – and is an alarming augur of what is to come. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, has become the latest organisation to employ Osborne. He will run OpenAI for Countries, a unit tasked with working directly with governments while expanding the company’s Stargate datacentre programme beyond the US. At least it was announced with a tweet, rather than a LinkedIn post.\n\nThe tweet prompted jokes, as did Osborne’s single-handed attempt to boost laggard employment figures brought about by his policies as the chancellor of austerity. But it’s a serious moment, because it’s another sign that the biggest AI firms are starting to behave less like normal companies and more like quasi-governments. They’re negotiating “national” partnerships, pitching a values-led vision of “democratic AI” and hiring former senior politicians as their diplomatic corps. It’s a similar path we have seen from other industries, including oil, pharma and defence, in previous decades – which is why it’s important to try to recognise the risks and head them off before AI companies can repeat the same trick.\n\nThe initiative Osborne is heading up, OpenAI for Countries, does what it says on the tin. It’s designed to embed OpenAI’s models and infrastructure inside the machinery of states, becoming an invaluable, indefatigable part of the running of our lives. OpenAI is in talks with about 50 countries to provide them with critical national infrastructure. Whether you welcome Osborne being put in that role rather than a tech executive is a little like Hobson’s choice: who do you distrust the least? But it’s an indication of how tech companies see their position in society that they are hiring such high-powered people for these roles.\n\nOsborne is not the first to don the branded hoodie and Silicon Valley lifestyle. His fellow coalition government bod Nick Clegg blazed the trail as head of global affairs for Meta. At the time of his initial hiring as a vice-president at Facebook in 2018, his appointment was treated as a PR move – a big name to help the company navigate scandal and scrutiny. But it hinted that platforms had become political actors, whether they liked it or not. The industry’s outsized spending on lobbyists (€151m in Europe alone at the last count) to support the political beasts is an indication of what is at stake. The numbers involved also hint at the scale of the prize that tech companies see: the 10 largest big tech firms now outspend the biggest 10 companies in the pharma, finance and automotive industries combined.\n\nThe former chancellor isn’t even the first former controller of the UK public purse to be handy to big tech. In October of this year, Rishi Sunak took advisory roles with Microsoft and the AI firm Anthropic, less than two years after he convened the AI safety summit at Bletchley Park. Sunak, at least, already had the regulation hoodie in his wardrobe.\n\nYou can read these moves in two ways. The generous interpretation is that these companies are hedging: trying to anticipate tech regulation and ensure they understand it. The more cynical interpretation is that they are attempting to shape the geopolitical story around AI from inside the machine, hiring former leaders less for their technical insight than their institutional muscle memory and networks.\n\nEither way, it leaves democracies with a problem. Governments are supposed to set the rules of the road. But the tech companies they are meant to regulate are on a different scale, planting their feet in different countries. When Sunak convened the Bletchley Park summit, it was notable that he turned interviewer to quiz Elon Musk, sitting starry-eyed on stage as Musk dominated the discourse.\n\nIt’s time to recognise these companies are acting like political actors. That means it’s time to treat them like political actors, too. We need more transparency: governments signing up to OpenAI for Countries agreements should publish the details of their partnerships by default. We should also ask more questions about infrastructure dependence. Governments love Stargate-style investments in their countries, and want to be able to don a hard hat, cut a ribbon and issue a press release. But if they are in effect a new layer of national backbone, they should be studied more closely – as if they are utilities, rather than receive the good grace of a startup-style mystique.\n\nThe more tech companies start to act like politicians and global leaders, the more we need to treat them like it. That doesn’t mean deference; it means more scepticism and journalistic interrogation.\n\nChris Stokel-Walker is the author of TikTok Boom: The Inside Story of the World’s Favourite App",

    "fullText": "Erebor Bank, Palmer Luckey's finance startup backed by some of the biggest names in tech, got one step closer to launching after it cleared another key federal hurdle this week.\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. approved Erebor on December 16 with conditions: The bank is subject to a strict capitalization requirement and must have investors ready to provide more funding if called upon.\n\nThe bank still requires final approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. It received preliminary approval from the OCC in October.\n\nTodd Baker, a senior fellow at Columbia University and a consultant to fintech companies who isn't involved with Erebor, said in an email that he would expect Erebor to get approval to open in early 2026.\n\nBaker said in an email that one of the FDIC's requirements — that the bank invoke a capital-call agreement that would require unnamed parties to chip in more cash if certain triggers occur — is \"highly unusual\" but \"entirely appropriate given the expectation that the bank will be taking on significant risks associated with its tech and crypto-focused business plan.\"\n\nA lawyer listed in regulatory documents as an Erebor spokesperson didn't reply to a comment request.\n\nWith funding from Joe Lonsdale and Peter Thiel, Erebor's valuation was reported to be about $2 billion earlier this year. Regulatory documents showed that the bank has brought on talent from both Luckey's tech circles as well as bank and bank-regulatory circles; earlier this month, a cryptocurrency event featured remarks by Erebor's Suzanne Dannheim, a former Goldman Sachs employee.\n\nErebor's founding team set out an ambitious timeline in its pitch to investors. The bank stressed founder Palmer Luckey's \"political network\" — he has contributed large sums to President Donald Trump and other Republican organizations — as a key asset.\n\nWith this recent round of regulatory approval, it may come close to meeting its proposed timeline.\n\nThe FDIC approval process kicked off on July 28, which means it received a green light in roughly 5 months. The median application processed last year took over eight months.\n\nSeveral other new bank applications emphasizing digital services are pending with the OCC and other regulators.\n\nMichele Alt, a bank-licensing consultant, said Erebor's quick turnaround at the FDIC is cause for celebration.\n\n\"The prior average was indicative of an unnecessarily slow-moving process and highly risk averse bureaucracy,\" she said in an email to Business Insider. \"I'm delighted to see more efficient processing of bank charter applications.\"",

    "fullText": "CryptoCryptocurrenciesBy Sidhartha ShuklaSaveOptions are showing that Bitcoin is heading into the final weeks of 2025 under intense pressure, with around $23 billion in contracts set to expire next Friday that threaten to amplify already-elevated volatility.The amount accounts for more than half of all the open interest on Deribit, the largest Bitcoin options venue. The looming buildup shows traders are pricing in continued downside risk in what’s become an even more perilous market. Bitcoin saw price swings of over $130 billion within an hour during US trading on Wednesday, triggering a cascade of both long and short liquidations. The broader crypto market has fluctuated around the $3 trillion threshold.",

    "fullText": "Peter Schiff warned that Bitcoin is unlikely to find a durable bottom at $50,000.\n\nSchiff argued that Strategy’s valuation is vulnerable to further declines.\n\nMichael Saylor and Strategy have downplayed downside risks and continue to add to their Bitcoin holdings.\n\nBitcoin critic Peter Schiff on Wednesday issued a renewed warning about BTC, arguing that prices will fall well below $50,000 over the long term.\n\nIn the same outburst, Schiff also accused Michael Saylor of disregarding shareholder value as Strategy continues one of the largest corporate Bitcoin accumulation campaigns on record, despite prices falling steeply in recent weeks.\n\nIn a reply on X, Schiff said Bitcoin would not establish a lasting bottom at $50,000, describing that level as merely a short-term reference point.\n\n“No, that’s just a very short-term price target based on MSTR. Long-term Bitcoin will go much lower than $50,000,” Schiff wrote, responding to a user who asked whether prices would rebound after reaching that level.\n\nIn a separate post, Schiff added that Bitcoin would be trading well below $50,000 by the time Strategy’s executive chairman ultimately exits his holdings.\n\n“Bitcoin will be much lower than $50,000 when that happens,” Schiff wrote in response to a user who said they planned to buy once Saylor sells his Bitcoin.\n\nSchiff also targeted Strategy’s stock, arguing that its valuation remains exposed to further downside and is closely linked to Bitcoin’s performance.\n\n“It’s hard to find a chart that looks worse than $MSTR,” Schiff wrote on X. “At a minimum, the stock should drop to about $80, which is half its current price.”\n\nHe added that such a decline in Strategy’s shares would likely coincide with another sharp drop in Bitcoin.\n\n“It’s hard to imagine MSTR dropping that much without a significant decline in Bitcoin as well,” Schiff said. “I’d say a minimum target for BTC is about $50K.”\n\nSchiff has repeatedly argued that Saylor’s Bitcoin-focused strategy prioritizes cryptocurrency exposure over the interests of equity investors.\n\nSaylor and Strategy have consistently minimized perceived risk during periods of Bitcoin volatility.\n\nAfter Bitcoin fell last month, Strategy stated on X that even if BTC declined to its average purchase price of roughly $74,000, the company’s holdings would still cover its outstanding convertible debt multiple times over.\n\nIn November, Strategy CEO Phong Le suggested the company could be forced to sell Bitcoin if its shares traded below the value of its underlying holdings.",

    "fullText": "Crypto markets were already on edge heading into President Donald Trump’s 9 PM EST primetime address to the nation from the White House.\n\nOnchain analysts spotted a large Ethereum move into Binance — the kind of transfer traders often associate with potential selling pressure, even when intentions are unclear.\n\nTrump said he would deliver “an ADDRESS TO THE NATION tomorrow night, LIVE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, at 9 P.M. EST,” in a Truth Social post on Dec. 16.\n\nThe president did not specify a topic for the address, leaving markets to price in uncertainty ahead of the broadcast.\n\nFor crypto traders, high-profile political speeches can act like sudden volatility triggers, not necessarily because of direct crypto policy, but because they can shift expectations around the dollar, rates, risk appetite and market regulation.\n\nThat dynamic can lead some participants to cut leverage or reduce exposure ahead of time.\n\nOn Dec. 17, hours before Trump's 9 p.m. address to the nation, blockchain analytics account Lookonchain reported that a whale wallet “fully exited 10,169 $ETH ($29.7M)” and claimed:\n\n“Over the past 3 years, the whale has made a total profit of $11.36M trading $ETH.”\n\nThe post linked to Arkham Intelligence, where the address page shows a transfer of 10,169 ETH to a Binance deposit destination in recent activity.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ether was trading at $3,014, up 1.8% in a day. Bitcoin was trading at $90,051, up 2.51% in the past 24 hours.\n\nLeaked memo shows popular crypto firm may wind down\n\nBitcoin, XRP slide as traders brace for key U.S. data\n\nAnalyst downgrades MicroStrategy amid higher dilution\n\nLarge holders - often called “crypto whales” - can influence liquidity and short-term price action simply by moving size, especially around major headline events.\n\nIn practice, traders tend to read whale deposits to exchanges as a potentially bearish signal (possible selling), while withdrawals from exchanges are often seen as more bullish (potential long-term holding).\n\nBut those signals can be noisy: whales also move funds for custody changes, collateral management, OTC settlement, or strategic rotation.\n\nWith Trump’s address set for 9 p.m. ET, traders will likely watch two things closely: whether more large wallets send crypto to exchanges in the hours before the speech, and whether derivatives markets show signs of rapid deleveraging.",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame has sounded the alarm on an AI bubble, dismissed bitcoin as \"worthless,\" and revisited his GameStop bet.",
    "fullText": "The mysterious Michael Burry has pulled back the curtain over the past six weeks, revealing his views on everything from bitcoin and meme stocks to the AI boom and the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame was previously known for posting cryptic warnings on X, only to swiftly delete them and go silent for months or years at a time.\n\nHe has now closed his hedge fund to outside cash, and shifted his focus to writing about his personal investments and sharing his financial analyses on Substack.\n\nBusiness Insider trawled through Burry's Substack, X posts, and a recent podcast interview with author Michael Lewis to gather the key insights and details he has shared so far.\n\nBurry returned to X in late October after going quiet in April 2023. His commentary since then has centered on concerns of a historic bubble in AI.\n\nHe has warned that the tech companies leading the charge are seeing a slowdown in cloud-computing growth, overinvesting in equipment such as Nvidia chips and data centers, dragging out depreciation to inflate their short-term earnings, destroying shareholder value through excessive stock-based compensation, and signing \"give-and-take\" contracts with one another to keep the buzz going.\n\nBurry — who shot to fame after his lucrative bet against the mid-2000s housing boom was chronicled by Lewis in \"The Big Short\" — has also compared AI mania to the dot-com and housing bubbles, predicting it too will end in disaster.\n\nHe has labeled OpenAI the \"Netscape of our time,\" saying it's \"hemorrhaging cash.\" He has disclosed bets against market darlings Nvidia and Palantir, and predicted the AI bubble will burst within two years. He has also advised investors who've won big on high-flying assets to cash out their winnings.\n\n\"I think the stock market could be in for a number of bad years,\" he told Lewis during what might be his final interview, per his Substack.\n\nBurry also said that bitcoin trading at $100,000 was \"the most ridiculous thing\" as it's \"not worth anything,\" and called it \"worse than a tulip bulb\" because it has enabled so much crime. The most popular cryptocurrency now trades below $90,000.\n\nOn the other hand, Burry revealed that he has owned gold since 2005, and described Google-parent Alphabet as the \"value investor's favorite\" among mega-cap tech stocks.\n\nBurry told Lewis that the Fed has \"done a lot of damage\" since its founding more than a century ago.\n\nHe said the US central bank doesn't do \"anything very helpful,\" and the Treasury could just have a department to set interest rates and control the money supply instead.\n\nBurry has also warned that the US banking system is showing signs of \"fragility,\" and banks are \"getting weaker way too fast.\"\n\nMoreover, he has defended his past comments on the regional banking fiasco, pandemic-fueled inflation, and a potential meme-stock crash, saying his calls were largely on the money.\n\nHe has shared details of his personal portfolio, including that he has emulated most of his fund's positions and owns shares of Lululemon, Molina Healthcare, Shift4 Payments, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac.\n\nIn a Monday post, he revisited his sale of GameStop shortly before the meme stock skyrocketed in January 2021, saying he had \"no idea what was coming.\" He also teased a future post that will be a \"breakdown of GameStop as an investment today.\"\n\nBurry's other revelations so far include the fact that he has known Nvidia's finance chief, Colette Kress, for years, and bought the chipmaker's stock in 2017 or 2018.\n\nAs promised in his Substack's name, \"Cassandra Unchained,\" Burry is speaking freely for the first time in many years — and may just be getting started.",

    "fullText": "Global macro analyst Luke Gromen, long known for his bullish stance on Bitcoin (BTC) as a hedge against fiat debasement, has adopted a more cautious outlook for the near term.\n\nSpeaking during a recent podcast appearance, Gromen warned that the asset could fall toward the $40,000 range.\n\nDuring the podcast, Gromen stressed that his broader investment thesis has not changed.\n\nHe continues to believe that long-term currency debasement will push investors toward scarce assets such as gold and Bitcoin.\n\nDollar debasement is the decline in the U.S. dollar’s purchasing power due to expanding money supply, inflation, or excessive government debt. This prompts investors to seek scarce assets like Bitcoin (BTC) or gold as protection.\n\nHowever, he now argues that gold and select equities may offer a cleaner expression of that trade than Bitcoin in the coming years.\n\n“Basically everything but gold and the dollar are likely to get waylaid,” Gromen said.\n\nGromen pointed to Bitcoin’s failure to make new highs relative to gold as a key warning sign. The absence of that breakout, he argued, suggests Bitcoin’s risk-reward profile has deteriorated.\n\nTreasury Secretary Bessent to propose major changes that could reshape crypto regulation\n\nAnalyst warns Fed’s $40B monthly Treasury buys could reprice crypto\n\nTeachers union warns new bill could put retirement savings at risk\n\nHe also highlighted a break below key long-term technical levels.\n\nAccording to Gromen, similar technical breakdowns in the recent past were followed by drawdowns, raising concerns that Bitcoin could face a deeper correction if history repeats.\n\n“When these technicals broke, each of the last three times, the median decline in Bitcoin was 65%–70% each time,” he said.\n\n\"The size it had grown in my portfolio, to me it just spoke to me a need to right-size it and substantially reduce positions. Because I think it's going a lot lower.\"\n\nAnother factor weighing on sentiment, according to Gromen, is the growing discussion around quantum computing risks. While most crypto traders consider it as a distant threat to Bitcoin’s cryptography, the topic has gained traction among investors.\n\nGromen suggested that large holders who have accumulated Bitcoin over the past decade may be increasingly inclined to hedge or trim exposure as the narrative gains visibility.\n\n“If I thought quantum was a risk I wanted to at least hedge somewhat, I would start to take some off the table,” he said, pointing to what he perceives as whale selling alongside weak price action.",

    "description": "Quarterly payments of $200 to be offered via stablecoin or traditional currency in a scheme designed to ease cost of living pressures in the Pacific nation",
    "fullText": "Quarterly payments of $200 to be offered via stablecoin or traditional currency in a scheme designed to ease cost of living pressures in the Pacific nation\n\nThe Marshall Islands has introduced a national universal basic income (UBI) scheme that offers payments via cryptocurrency, alongside more traditional methods, which experts say is the first scheme of its kind in the world.\n\nUnder the program, every resident citizen of the Marshall Islands will receive quarterly payments of about US$200 as part of a government effort to ease cost of living pressures. The first instalments were paid in late November and recipients can choose whether the money is paid into a bank account, by cheque, or delivered as cryptocurrency on the blockchain through a government-backed digital wallet.\n\n“We the government want to make sure no one is left behind,” Marshall Islands’ minister for finance David Paul told the Guardian.\n\n“$200 per person per quarter, which is about $800 a year, does not compel you to quit your job … but it’s actually like a morale booster for people.”\n\nAn archipelago in the Pacific Ocean, the Marshall Islands lies between Hawaii and Australia, and has a population of about 42,000. Paul said the payments were intended as a “social safety net” as the country faces rising costs and citizens leaving.\n\nThe UBI scheme is financed by a trust fund created under an agreement with the United States, which in part aims to compensate the Marshall Islands for decades of American nuclear testing. The fund holds more than $1.3bn in assets, with the US committing a further $500m through to 2027.\n\nDr Huy Pham, associate professor and crypto-fintech lead at RMIT University, said the Marshall Islands scheme “is the world first for a national rollout of a UBI program.” He said the use of blockchain technology is “unique in terms of a nation-wide implementation.”\n\nThe cryptocurrency delivery option – which involves the transfer of a digital token known as a stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar – was designed to address the practical challenge of delivering the money across hundreds of remote islands.\n\n“We saw the opportunity in what the blockchain has to offer,” Paul said.\n\nBlockchain is best known as the technology behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but can also be used to store and transfer more traditional assets – like government bonds – which the Marshall Islands is using to underpin their digital payment scheme.\n\nBut according to Pham, digital payments alone do not necessarily provide financial inclusion, especially in a country like the Marshall Islands where internet connectivity is patchy and frequently disrupted.\n\n“Improving internet coverage, improving smartphone penetration – all these kinds of things are the minimum for a blockchain-based economy,” he said.\n\nMost recipients are choosing to receive payments through conventional channels. According to the Marshall Islands Social Security Administration, about 60% of the first round of payments were deposited directly into bank accounts, with the remainder issued as paper checks. Only a small number of people – about 12 so far, officials say – have signed up to receive payments on their digital wallet\n\nAnelie Sarana, the finance manager involved in the rollout, said over the past year her team has travelled to the outermost islands of the country to register people in the scheme.\n\nSarana said many recipients were using the money immediately for basic needs, like food and essentials, while others used the $200 to pay for celebrations to commemorate the annual Gospel Day holiday which coincided with the first distribution.\n\n“I know they’re happy, because you can see in the streets, there’s so much traffic, it’s like there’s a big something happening,” she said.\n\nThis is not the first time the Marshall Islands has experimented with using cryptocurrency. In 2018, the government attempted to create a national cryptocurrency known as the Sovereign, or SOV. The plan ultimately stalled after warnings from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nThe IMF has cautioned that while the technology underpinning the latest scheme is innovative, the blockchain-based delivery of universal basic income carries “financial, fiscal, legal, reputational, and financial integrity risks”, particularly if governance and oversight are not robust.\n\nDr Monique Taylor, a lecturer in world politics at the University of Helsinki, said it was hard to predict if the Marshall Islands’ experiment with a universal basic income and a cryptocurrency delivery system would succeed.\n\n“Universal income schemes are rare, particularly at national scale, and there are no direct precedents that combine this fiscal architecture with a digital delivery component in a small island state,” she said.\n\nBut, she believed the scheme did present benefits for small island nations.\n\n“In a geographically dispersed island state where conventional banking infrastructure can be limited, a digital wallet may lower frictions and make transfers more accessible, particularly in outer atolls,” she said.",

    "fullText": "Caroline Ellison, the former cryptocurrency executive and ex-girlfriend of Sam Bankman-Fried, has been quietly moved out of federal lockup after serving roughly 11 months of her two-year prison sentence, Business Insider has learned.\n\nEllison, 31, was transferred on October 16 from the Danbury Federal Correctional Institution in Connecticut to what's known as community confinement, a Federal Bureau of Prisons spokesperson said.\n\nThat means Ellison, the former CEO of Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research cryptocurrency hedge fund, remains in federal custody but is now either in home confinement or a halfway house, BOP spokesperson Randilee Giamusso told Business Insider.\n\n\"For privacy, safety, and security reasons, we do not discuss the conditions of confinement for any individual, including reasons for transfers or release plans, nor do we specify an individual's specific location while in community confinement,\" Giamusso said.\n\nOnline prison records list Ellison's projected release date as February 20, 2026 — nearly nine months early. Her attorneys declined to comment for this story.\n\nEllison reported to the low-security Danbury prison in early November 2024 to serve a two-year sentence she received for her role in the massive multibillion-dollar fraud scheme that led to the collapse of Bankman-Fried's business empire.\n\nShe had pleaded guilty to conspiring with Bankman-Fried — the founder of the FTX crypto exchange and its sister company, Alameda Research — in the $11 billion fraud scheme.\n\nEllison served as the star witness in Bankman-Fried's 2023 criminal trial, testifying that the pair used Alameda to invest billions of dollars' worth of assets secretly siphoned from FTX customers.\n\nAt Ellison's sentencing hearing, US District Judge Lewis Kaplan praised her \"substantial\" cooperation in the prosecution of Bankman-Fried, but said the seriousness of the case still required prison time.\n\nHer lawyers had asked that the judge not impose any prison time, but Kaplan rejected what he called a \"literal get-out-of-jail-free card.\"\n\nBefore she was sentenced, Ellison, holding back tears, apologized and expressed regret for her participation in the fraud scheme.\n\n\"On some level, my brain doesn't even comprehend all the people I harmed,\" Ellison told the court. \"That doesn't mean I don't try.\"\n\nBankman-Fried was sentenced by Kaplan to 25 years in prison after a jury found him guilty of all seven counts of fraud and conspiracy.\n\nThe FTX founder and former CEO remains behind bars at a low-security federal prison in San Pedro, California, as he appeals his conviction and sentence.\n\nBankman-Fried's lawyers have argued that he should get a new trial after prosecutors unfairly previewed his testimony.",

    "description": "From 2,600% gains to 86% wipeouts: How crypto stock bubble burst",
    "fullText": "What began the year as one of the best trades in the stock market has, in a matter of months, turned into one of the worst.\n\nAn array of public companies thought they had found a sort of perpetual motion machine: Use your corporate cash to buy up bitcoin or other digital tokens and presto, your share price shot up even more than the value of the tokens you bought.\n\nIt was a playbook invented by Michael Saylor, who transformed his company, Strategy Inc., into a publicly traded bitcoin holding vehicle. And through the first half of 2025 it worked for more than a hundred other companies that followed Saylor’s lead.\n\nDigital asset treasuries, as these firms became known, turned into one of the hottest trends in the public markets, as share prices skyrocketed and everyone from Peter Thiel to the Trump family piled in.\n\nOne prominent entrant, SharpLink Gaming Inc., soared more than 2,600% in a matter of days as the company said it would pivot from its old work in gaming, and sell shares to buy up lots and lots of Ethereum tokens, with one of Ethereum’s co-founders as the chairman.\n\nBut it was always hard to explain why tokens should be worth more just because they were held by a public company, and the wheels began to come off the car, at first slowly and then much more quickly.\n\nIn the case of SharpLink, the stock has fallen 86% from its peak, leaving the whole company worth less than the digital tokens it owns. The company now trades at roughly 0.9 times its Ether holdings. It was, at least, spared the fate of Greenlane Holdings, which plunged more than 99% this year, despite its stash of around $48 million BERA crypto tokens.\n\n“Investors took a look and understood that there’s not much yield from these holdings rather than just sitting on this pile of money, and that’s why they contracted,” B. Riley Securities Analyst Fedor Shabalin said in an interview.\n\nAmong the U.S. and Canadian-listed companies that became digital asset treasuries, the median stock price has fallen 43% this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bitcoin, by comparison, is down around just 6% since the beginning of the year.\n\nSome lucky digital asset treasuries are still worth more than their underlying holdings, but most have been losers for people who bought them when they were anywhere near their peaks and 70% are on track to end the year below where they began it, according to Bloomberg’s calculations.\n\nThe worst performers have been public companies that eschewed bitcoin and went for smaller, more volatile tokens.\n\nTwo of Trump’s sons lined up behind Alt5 Sigma Corp., a public company that set out to buy more than a billion dollars of WLFI, a token issued by a separate company that was co-founded by the Trump family. Those shares have fallen about 86% from their peak in June.\n\nThe volatility of these stocks is explained, at least in part, by all the money that was borrowed to pay for the corporate crypto acquisitions.\n\nStrategy came up with a remarkable array of convertible bonds and preferred shares that funded the company’s bitcoin purchases, with the tokens growing to be worth more than $70 billion at one point. Digital asset treasuries as a group raised more than $45 billion this year to purchase crypto tokens, according to Shabalin at B. Riley.\n\nNow, though, Strategy and all the other companies are on the hook to make the interest and dividend payments on that debt. That is a problem because their crypto holdings, for the most part, don’t generate any cash flow.\n\n“If you own Strategy, you own the bitcoin risk plus whatever kind of corporate stress, corporate risk they are taking on,” RIA Advisors Portfolio Manager Michael Lebowitz said in an interview.\n\nStrategy has recently tried to raise more capital to keep the flywheel spinning, turning to Europe in November to sell perpetual preferred stocks at a discount, after U.S. preferred shares sales fell short of expectations. But those euro-denominated preferred stocks have already fallen below their offer price.\n\nMeanwhile, for smaller digital asset treasuries without name recognition, capital raising opportunities are even harder to come by as crypto prices decline and investor enthusiasm wanes.\n\nFor Strategy, the obvious next step is to sell some of its crypto holdings to pay the bills. And that is what Saylor’s chief executive officer, Phong Le, said the company might do.\n\n“We can sell bitcoin and we would sell bitcoin if we needed to fund our dividend payments,” Le said on a podcast.\n\nLe said he will look at this option if the company’s so-called mNAV falls below 1, a calculation that would suggest the company’s market value has fallen below the value of its crypto holdings.\n\nThese comments shook the digital asset treasury industry because Saylor had said many times that he would not sell his bitcoin, and would buy more when the price went down.\n\n“Sell a kidney if you must, but keep the Bitcoin,” he joked in a February post on X.\n\nThe big concern now is that digital asset treasuries will be forced to sell their crypto, which will push down the prices of those tokens, setting off a downward spiral.\n\n“If there’s a headline that says Strategy sold, even if it’s three bitcoin, I think after everything Michael Saylor has said about he’s never selling a dime, people are going to start to question the whole bitcoin trade,” Lebowitz said.\n\nStrategy has created a $1.4-billion reserve fund to cover dividend payments in the near term. And shares are still up more than 1,200% since it started buying bitcoin in August 2020. But they are on track for a 38% decline this year.\n\nThe digital asset treasury wipeout risks bleeding into broader markets if traders are using borrowed money, which could force them to sell in order to cover margin calls. For now, the problems have largely cut off the flow of new companies adopting the strategy — and the burst of capital markets activity that it created.\n\nBut there are signs that there may be at least some new activity from somewhat more valuable digital asset treasuries acquiring smaller digital asset treasuries that are worth less than their holdings.\n\nStrive Inc., co-founded by former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, agreed to acquire Semler Scientific Inc. in an all-stock deal in September, merging the two bitcoin treasury companies. Semler was one of the first digital asset treasuries and has fallen 65% this year.\n\nRoss Carmel, a partner at Sichenzia Ross Ference Carmel, expects that mergers and acquisitions will pick up for digital asset treasuries in early 2026 with a focus on the potential for further pain.\n\nThe industry is likely to see more structured securities transactions “that can be used to give these investors more downside protection in these deals,” Carmel said.",

    "fullText": "New analysis suggests Bitcoin’s four-year cycles have been replaced — and the world’s biggest cryptocurrency could rebound to $140,000 at some point in the next 180 days.\n\nAccording to Copper, the arrival of exchange-traded funds tracking BTC’s spot price have changed this digital asset’s behavior, and given way to what it calls the “cost-basis returns cycle.”\n\n“Across 2024/2025, Bitcoin has exhibited the same repeatable pattern: price breaks to new all-time highs, corrects sharply, and then finds support almost perfectly at its ETF investor cost basis before beginning the next expansion.”\n\nThe company’s analysis suggests we have seen this play out three times since these ETFs launched back in January 2024 — with each cycle delivering returns of more than 60%.\n\nCopper also claims this has exposed a significant divide between crypto-focused traders and institutional investors, with some Bitcoin commentators claiming it is “the worst bull market ever.”\n\nSo… what exactly causes these sharp corrections once BTC enters price discovery mode? Well, its analysis suggests that institutions rebalancing their portfolios is primarily to blame — an activity that “transforms Bitcoin’s volatility into realized returns.”\n\n“Institutions are not ‘staking sats’ — in fact, most do not care about sats at all now that Bitcoin is accessible through equities-style ETF shares. They care about risk-adjusted contribution to a portfolio.”\n\nGenerally speaking, it’s been recommended that institutions allocate somewhere between 2% and 5% into Bitcoin — but a sudden surge in price can have a huge impact.\n\n“Without rebalancing, a modest 2% Bitcoin allocation drifts to 6.2% in less than 180 days during these cycles. A 5% allocation drifts dangerously close to double-digit.”\n\nCopper’s head of research Fadi Aboualfa told Cryptonews that Bitcoin is now at a critical juncture.\n\n“With BTC now trading near its $84,000 cost basis, that pattern points to a move north of $140,000 in the next 180 days. If cost basis rises 10% to 15% as in prior cycles, the resulting premium seen at past peaks produces a target range of $138,000 to $148,000.”\n\nThe prospect of a return to all-time highs within the next six months would provide a much-needed dose of “hopium” for traders. However, other analysts have warned there are few catalysts that can drive BTC forwards at the moment. The Federal Reserve’s recent 0.25 percentage point interest rate reduction was largely priced in, with policymakers suggesting there may only be one cut in 2026.\n\nA big test will concern what happens if Bitcoin’s value falls below its cost basis for ETF investors — and whether sell-offs would intensify if institutions spent a prolonged period in the red.",

    "description": "JPMorgan's asset management unit is launching a tokenized money market fund tied to the ethereum blockchain.",
    "fullText": "JPMorgan is set to offer clients access to a tokenized money market fund as part of Wall Street's latest crypto push.\n\nThe bank announced that its asset management arm will launch a tokenized money-market fund that will run on the ethereum blockchain. My OnChain Net Yield Fund (MONY) will be supported by Kinexys Digital Assets, the bank's tokenization platform.\n\nMONY will hold short-term debt and issue daily interest payouts in the same way traditional money market funds do. The key difference lies in the fact that its shares will exist on the ethereum blockchain network, and investors can redeem them using either cash or the USDC stablecoin.\n\nThe new fund, which The Wall Street Journal reported will be offered to wealthy clients and institutions, will have a minimum investment of $1 million. Its launch is the latest crypto move from the bank, which also recently tokenized some private equity investments in October.\n\nIt's also the latest crypto push from Wall Street broadly. Asset management titans, including Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and BlackRock, have also been offering crypto investments and blockchain solutions for clients.\n\nJPMorgan will commit $100 million of its own capital to the fund before officially opening it up to investors on December 16.\n\nDespite some skepticism from CEO Jamie Dimon over the years, the bank has made inroads into crypto and has been recently bullish on the price of bitcoin. JPMorgan analysts said recently that bitcoin could buck its latest downtrend and reach $170,000 in 2026.\n\nAsset tokenization has been in focus in 2025, with platforms like Robinhood framing it as a means of trading more efficiently or potentially gaining exposure to private investments.\n\nThe passing of the GENIUS Act, meanwhile, has offered support for stablecoins, a key component for tokenized funds like MONY.",

    "description": "Ethereum price trades near a breakout zone as selling pressure eases. Key levels now decide whether $4,000 comes into play.",
    "fullText": "Ethereum price action looks quiet, but the entire formation is slowly turning bullish. Over the past 24 hours, ETH has traded almost flat, while the past seven days show a modest 2.6% gain. Price has remained above $3,100 for several sessions, suggesting strength rather than exhaustion.\n\nThis sideways move is not random. Ethereum is compressing near key levels, where breakouts often form. The next move depends on whether buyers, who are gradually returning, can turn this consolidation into a continuation.\n\nEthereum appears to be breaking out after consolidating inside a bull flag. A bull flag forms when the price pauses after a strong upward move, then trades in a narrow range before the next leg higher. This pattern signals consolidation, not weakness.\n\nThe structure remains intact as long as ETH holds above $3,090. That means, unless there is a daily candle close below this level, the much-anticipated breakout might hold.\n\nThis level has acted as firm support, absorbing selling pressure during recent pullbacks. Price has repeatedly bounced from this zone, showing buyers are still defending it.\n\nWant more token insights like this? \n\nA clean daily close above $3,130 would be the first confirmation that the flag is resolving higher. That move would signal that consolidation is ending and buyers are regaining control. Without that close, Ethereum remains in compression, but the bullish structure stays valid.\n\nOn-chain data support the price structure. Holder Net Position Change, which tracks whether long-term investors are adding or selling ETH, shows that selling pressure has eased compared to earlier sessions.\n\nOn December 12, Ethereum holders distributed roughly 958,771 ETH. By December 13, net selling dropped to around 877,958 ETH, marking a decline of roughly 8.4% in selling pressure within 24 hours.\n\nThat shift matters. Ethereum is still seeing net distribution, but the pace of selling is slowing as the price compresses near resistance. This behavior typically appears during late-stage consolidation, not during breakdowns.\n\nWhen selling pressure eases near a key level without price slipping lower, it increases the odds that buyers step in once a breakout confirms. Ethereum is not seeing panic exits. Instead, holders appear more willing to wait.\n\nIf the Ethereum price secures a daily close above $3,130, the next resistance sits near $3,390. Clearing that zone would open the path toward the $4,000–$4,020 area, aligning with the measured move from the bull flag structure.",

    "fullText": "Rachel Reeves wants to protect consumers by bringing digital money and assets into the ‘regulatory perimeter’\n\nCryptocurrencies will be regulated in a similar way to other financial products under legislation coming into force in 2027.\n\nThe Treasury is drawing up rules that will require crypto companies to meet a set of standards overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\n\nMinisters have sought to overhaul the crypto market, which has ballooned in popularity as a way of investing money and making payments.\n\nCryptocurrencies have not been subject to the same regulation as traditional financial products such as stocks and shares, which means that in many cases consumers do not enjoy the same level of protection.\n\nThe government said the new rules would make the crypto industry more transparent, boost consumer confidence and make it easier to detect suspicious activity, impose sanctions and hold companies accountable.\n\nRachel Reeves, the chancellor, said: “Bringing crypto into the regulatory perimeter is a crucial step in securing the UK’s position as a world-leading financial centre in the digital age.\n\n“By giving firms clear rules of the road, we are providing the certainty they need to invest, innovate and create high-skilled jobs here in the UK, while giving millions strong consumer protections, and locking dodgy actors out of the UK market.”\n\nCrypto companies, which can include crypto exchanges and digital wallets, must register with the FCA if they provide services that fall within the scope of the UK’s money-laundering regulations.\n\nThe changes mooted by the Treasury will bring companies that provide crypto services into the remit of the FCA and mean the services are regulated in the same way as other financial products, including by being subject to transparency standards.\n\nLucy Rigby, the minister for the City of London, said: “We want the UK to be at the top of the list for crypto assets firms looking to grow and these new rules will give firms the clarity and consistency they need to plan for the long term.”\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has suffered from turbulence amid growing investor fears about a potential artificial intelligence bubble.\n\nBanking industry data in October showed that the amount of money lost to investment scams by UK consumers had surged by 55% in a year, with fake cryptocurrency thought to top the list.\n\nA Chinese woman living in the UK was convicted in September over a multibillion-pound bitcoin fraud.\n\nZhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, orchestrated a fraud in China between 2014 and 2017 that left 128,000 people out of pocket. The 45-year-old stored the proceeds in bitcoin but UK authorities made a breakthrough in the case when they raided a Hampstead mansion in 2018 and seized devices from Qian holding 61,000 bitcoins, worth more than £5bn at current prices.\n\nThe Metropolitan police believe it is the largest single cryptocurrency seizure in the world. Qian pleaded guilty at Southwark crown court on Monday to acquiring and possessing cryptocurrency that was criminal property.\n\nMinisters are also drawing up plans to ban political donations made with cryptocurrency, amid concerns that it is difficult to determine their origin and ownership.\n\nNigel Farage’s Reform UK, which became the country’s first party to accept contributions in digital currency this year, is believed to have received its first registrable donations in cryptocurrency this autumn. It has set up a crypto portal to receive contributions, saying it is subject to “enhanced” checks.\n\nReform this month received £9m from Christopher Harborne, a cryptocurrency investor and businessman based in Thailand – the largest donation made by a living person to a British political party.",

    "description": "The presumed pseudonymous Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, disappeared without a trace on this day in 2010.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nDespite the colossal influence of cryptocurrencies on commerce, computing, and even politics, the true identity of the presumed pseudonymous Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, remains a mystery in 2025. Making things trickier for identity sleuths, this individual (or perhaps the name represents a group?) disappeared without a trace on this day in 2010, that’s exactly 15 years ago.\n\nThough the last public message from the BTC founder was about technical matters, an email that appears to be from Nakamoto's account was sent to a fellow Bitcoin enthusiast, Mike Hearn, in April 2011. It began with an explanation for absence, of sorts, with the first line reading \"I've moved onto other things.\"\n\nBenjamin Wallace, the author of The Mysterious Mr. Nakamoto: A Fifteen-year Quest to Unmask the Secret Genius behind Crypto, wrote earlier this year that the BTC creator’s defining moment was the publication of an article on November 1, 2008.\n\nOn that day, the nine-page-long Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was shared on a little-known crypto mailing list. Its significance: it would solve the double-spending problem, which had cryptographers in knots for decades prior.\n\nIn essence, Nakamoto proposed a public ledger using blockchain that would prevent fraudulent copying and thus double-spending of any digital asset. This peer-to-peer system would be developed and refined by the BTC creator over the following months before their disappearance.\n\nWherever they are or however they live today, the most famous name in crypto history may also be one of the wealthiest entities in the world. Recently cited as the 11th-richest ‘person,’ Nakamoto is thought to still hold the majority of the 1.1 million BTC they mined in the currency’s first year.\n\nToday, that crypto fortune would be worth about $99 billion. However, BTC valuations have recently slid to around $90,000 after several months of oscillation around the $110,000 to $120,000 level.\n\nNakamoto’s BTC fortune has remained unspent since 2010, while its valuation has fluctuated wildly. This incredible level of HODLing has led analysts to believe the BTC creator has either passed away or has tragically lost access to the crypto. Others still believe Nakamoto is intentionally maintaining an absolute silence.\n\nBitcoin has no expiration mechanism, with no timeouts, no inactivity penalties, or other kind of reversion to the network. Moreover, there seems to be no quantum or other new-fangled computer cryptography tech that is anywhere near breaking the SHA-256 algorithm. Thus, these coins may indeed remain inaccessible to anyone other than Nakamoto for the next 20–40 years.\n\nHowever, the situation could change if any of the founders’ coins are ever moved or spent. Such an action would cause a stir in itself. Still, it would also expose the public key of that specific coin, creating a more vulnerable attack surface for a sufficiently powerful future quantum computer.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.",

Mangione's possessions, as described during the hearing, included a MacBook laptop, an iPhone, multiple thumb drives, and a small circuit board wrapped in cardboard.\n\nIt had not been previously revealed that Mangione may have been into crypto. Still, he once gained a small following among crypto investors.\n\nSoon after his arrest, a LUIGI memecoin was launched in his name, and quickly surged in value, reaching a $60 million market capitalization, according to multiple contemporaneous accounts in the crypto press.\n\nJust as quickly, it cratered; a $1,000 investment made at the coin's launch, in mid-December 2024, would be worth about $25 now.\n\nMangione's evidence suppression hearing is scheduled to start its third week on Tuesday.",

    "fullText": "One of Wall Street's biggest bitcoin cheerleaders has significantly dialed down his forecast for the crypto.\n\nGeoff Kendrick of Standard Chartered, who previously said he saw bitcoin climbing as high as $200,000 by the end of 2025, told clients in a note that the bank has aggressively slashed its price forecasts for bitcoin through the end of the decade.\n\nKendrick said the bank's view is now for bitcoin to end this year at around $100,000, implying 6% upside from the crypto's current levels.\n\nFor next year, he see bitcoin hitting $150,000, about half of the prior target of $300,000.\n\nHere's the rundown of where Standard Chartered thinks the token is headed over the next five years:\n\nThe price target changes were largely spurred by bitcoin's recent sell-off, Kendrick, the global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, wrote in a note on Tuesday. The crypto is down around 27% from its peak in early October.\n\nHe said that bitcoin treasuries — firms that buy and hold bitcoin on their balance sheets — likely won't support the price of the cryptocurrency going forward. Instead, the token will have to rely primarily on ETF buying to move higher, he added.\n\n\"Price action has forced us to recalibrate our Bitcoin price forecasts,\" Kendrick wrote, adding that the firm believed bitcoin treasury buying had \"run its course,\" though ETF inflows could pick up \"periodically.\"\n\nIt's been a rough year for bitcoin, which was rocked earlier in the year as markets reacted to tariffs, and has been weighed down by worries about higher inflation and fewer Fed rate cuts in 2026.\n\nIts latest decline has been brought on by a handful of bearish factors, like low liquidity in the market, a risk-off mood amid rate-cut uncertainty, and speculation that Strategy, the largest corporate buyer of bitcoin, could have to sell some of its token.",

    "fullText": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin asserted only a year ago that no power can ban Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) regardless of what happens to the dollar. While many saw it as a message to the West on international sanctions, the country has taken targeted steps to open its economy to the world’s largest cryptocurrency.\n\nDuring an investment conference in Moscow on Dec. 4, 2024, Putin argued that the influence of the dollar on the global economy was waning, paving the way for the growth of other instruments.\n\n“For instance – Bitcoin. Who can prohibit its use? No one,” Putin said. “Or the use of other electronic ways of settlement. No one can ban the use of them.”\n\nPutin added that the new instruments would “continue developing” regardless of what happens to the dollar.\n\nDon’t Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nShortly after these comments, Russia’s Finance Minister Anton Siluanov revealed that Russian companies have started using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for cross-border transactions, described as a response to trade disruptions from sanctions imposed after the Ukraine war.\n\nThe minister said that it was possible to use the Bitcoin mined in Russia in foreign trade.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Putin greenlighted Bitcoin mining in the country earlier that year. He previously rejected the central bank's proposal to ban cryptocurrencies in 2022, arguing that the country possesses \"competitive advantages\" in the field of mining.\n\nIn accordance with Putin’s directives, the central bank proposed in March of this year to allow a limited number of “highly qualified” Russian investors to purchase and sell cryptocurrencies under a new three-year experimental legal regime.\n\nThe bank maintained that it still doesn’t see cryptocurrency as a means of payment and proposed a ban on all cryptocurrency transactions between Russian residents outside the experimental regime.\n\nSee Also: Fast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share\n\nHowever, recent developments suggest attempts to expand cryptocurrency access for Russians. Bank of Russia First Deputy Governor Vladimir Chistyukhin said that rules should be eased beyond the “extremely narrow” category of qualified investors, given the sanctions in place, according to a Cryptopolitan report.",

    "description": "MSCI could exclude crypto treasury firms from its widely followed indexes. The move is drawing sharp criticism from industry players.",
    "fullText": "A possible move by indexing giant MSCI to exclude crypto treasury companies from its widely followed indexes is drawing fierce backlash from the industry.\n\nMSCI is considering excluding companies that have 50% or more of their assets invested in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. The index provider announced the plans in October, with a decision on the move potentially to come in January.\n\nMSCI argues that crypto treasury companies are more like investment funds than operating companies. The idea has drawn opposition from Michael Saylor's Strategy, as well as Viek Ramaswamy's Strive Asset Management.\n\nBitcoin prices have been volatile lately, with the potential for fresh struggles among companies that accumulate crypto being eyed as another headwind for the market.\n\nCrypto market players told Business Insider they see MSCI's move as a mistake.\n\nAdam Levine, CEO of digital asset infrastructure firm Fireblocks, said that MSCI's plan likely won't play well with institutional investors that have warmed to digital assets in recent years, and who could be forced to rebalance their holdings that track the index.\n\n\"When major indexes leave out companies that work with digital assets in a meaningful way, they're introducing the potential of missing key market players at a time when more businesses are innovating with stablecoins and tokenized equity,\" he stated. \"It's equivalent to intentionally ignoring early internet companies 30 years ago.\"\n\nWhile the implications for DATs could be severe if MSCI decides to exclude them from its indexes, sources say bitcoin can still recover from its bear market.\n\nWojciech Kaszycki, chief strategy officer at blockchain infrastructure firm BTCS S.A., predicts that a bitcoin rebound is coming, and others say MSCI's potential move has been baked into the market's outlook already.\n\n\"Decisions by MSCI and other index providers have real implications for digital asset treasuries and, by extension, the underlying crypto they hold,\" said Spencer Hallarn, head of OTC trading at crypto market maker GSR. \"That said, this potential move has been well telegraphed, so it's reasonable to assume the market has already priced it in and that it's unlikely to come as a surprise.\"",

    "description": "These flows represent a bullish bet on volatility rather than a downside hedge or outright bearish position.",
    "fullText": "Deep out-of-the-money (OTM) bitcoin (BTC) put options are lighting up in longer-dated expiries, as traders pick up cheap lottery tickets for potential moonshot payoffs if BTC swings wild.\n\nOn leading crypto options exchange Deribit, the $20,000 strike put is the second most popular among the June 2026 expiry options, boasting a notional open interest of over $191 million.\n\nNotional open interest is the dollar value of the number of active contracts. Put options at strikes below the going market rate of BTC are said to be OTM. These OTM puts tend to be cheaper than those near or above the spot price of BTC.\n\nThe June expiry also sees significant activity in other OTM puts at $30,000, $40,000, $60,000, and $75,000 strikes.\n\nActivity in deep OTM puts is typically read as traders bracing for a price crash. But that's not necessarily the case here, as the exchange has also seen activity on higher-strike calls above $200,000.\n\nTaken together, these flows represent a bullish view on long-dated volatility at low cost rather than a bet on price direction, according to Deribit's Global Head of Retail Sidrah Fariq. Think of it as cheap lottery tickets on a potential volatility explosion over the next six months.\n\n\"There is about 2,117 open interest on the $20K bitcoin put for the June expiry. We also saw some big trades in the $30,000 put and $230,000 call strikes. The combination of these far out of the money options does not suggest directional trading, but rather deep wing trades that professionals use to trade long-dated volatility cheaply and adjust tail risk in their books,\" Fariq told CoinDesk.\n\nShe explained that it's essentially volatility positioning, not price positioning, because the $20,000 put or the $230,000 call are simply too far from the spot price to be a purely protective hedge. As of writing, BTC changed hands near $90,500, according to CoinDesk data.\n\nThose holding both OTM calls and puts could score asymmetric payoffs from extreme volatility or wild price swings in either direction. But if markets stay flat, these options quickly lose value.\n\nOptions are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A put option provides the right to sell and represents a bearish bet on the market. A call offers the right to buy.\n\nThe crypto options market, including the one tied to BlackRock's IBIT ETF, has evolved into a sophisticated arena where institutions and whales engage in three-dimensional chess, managing risk and profiting from price direction, time decay, and volatility swings.\n\nBroadly speaking, the options market mood appears bearish, as BTC puts continue to trade at a premium to calls across all tenors, according to Amberdata's options risk reversals. This is at least partly due to persistent call overwriting, a strategy aimed at boosting yield on top of spot market holdings.",
