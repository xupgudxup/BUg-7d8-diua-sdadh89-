    "description": "Cryptocurrency Exchange Architecture is the framework of a crypto platform, ensuring efficient trade matching, secure wallets, liquidity handling, and smooth user interaction for reliable trading",
    "fullText": "Cryptocurrency exchange architecture forms the foundation of every trading platform, determining how trades are executed, funds are secured, and users interact. In 2026, with over 200 active exchanges globally and centralized platforms like Binance handling nearly 40% of the world’s spot trading volume, having a secure, scalable, and high-performance architecture is more important than ever.\n\nAs the crypto ecosystem evolves, exchange platforms are adopting new technologies, from hybrid and decentralized models to advanced security protocols and automated liquidity management. These innovations ensure faster transactions, enhanced user experience, and regulatory compliance, positioning modern exchanges to meet the demands of both retail and institutional traders.\n\nIn this blog, we’ll explore the latest trends, core components, and architectural advancements shaping cryptocurrency exchanges today.\n\nCryptocurrency exchange architecture is the technical blueprint of an exchange, defining how the trading engine matches orders, how funds are stored, and how users interact. Leveraging scalable engines, real-time order books, and intuitive frontends, a well-designed architecture ensures fast, secure, and compliant operations, supporting both high-volume traders and everyday users in a reliable, seamless environment.\n\nWhen built well, this architecture makes the exchange fast, secure, and dependable. Conversely, poorly designed architecture can lead to downtime, security vulnerabilities, or slow, frustrating user experiences, issues that can quickly harm an exchange’s reputation in today’s competitive market.\n\nTo understand how exchanges are built, here are the primary building blocks:\n\nAny exchange revolves around the trading or matching engine. It pairs buy and sell orders according to the rules such as price-time priority. The engine also needs to be able to process millions of orders in a second with a small latency in the high-performance systems. As an example, the matching engine of Binance can handle very large throughput\n\nLiquidity is the capacity to sell or purchase assets very easily without any major alterations in prices. Trades employ various liquidity designs: centralized order books with designated market makers, on-chain liquidity books (in the case of DEXs), or hybrid. The architecture should facilitate effective access to liquidity, potentially with a combination of several sources.\n\nThe manner in which an exchange manages user money is of the essence. Other exchanges are custodial (they custody user wallets), non-custodial (the user retains control with private keys). Hybrid models may allow both. The wallet architecture also determines the nature of handling deposits, withdrawals, and cold/ hot storage in a secure way.\n\nOrder book records outstanding buys/sell orders. Exchanges can be on-chain (occasionally deployed on pure DEX), off-chain or in-memory. The structure of the order book has an impact on performance, transparency and security.\n\nIt has no compromise on security: It includes authentication (KYC, 2FA), fund security (Multi-sig, cold storage), smart contract audits (DEX), and resistance to trading risks, such as front-running, MEV, or DDoS. These security layers should be in-built in the architecture.\n\nTrade is made easy, responsive and trustworthy with the good front end. The UX should receive order placement, charting, account and wallet connections, and give real-time feedback.\n\nA robust admin panel allows operators to monitor trades, manage liquidity, configure markets, and handle risk. Modern exchanges also include crypto exchange APIs for automated tools, third-party integrations, and liquidity management, essential for scalability in turnkey deployments.\n\nIn particular, the fiat on-ramps and off-ramps (banks, payment processors) come in handy, especially when it comes to centralized exchanges. The architecture should be equipped with trustworthy and secure payment systems to exchange crypto and fiat.\n\nThere are various types of cryptocurrency exchange that have their own architecture, features, advantages, and trade-offs. Knowing such types assists the user, the developer and investors to assess performance, security and usability.\n\nCentralized exchanges operate on a traditional client-server model, where the platform manages user accounts, wallets, and order matching. Trades are executed through a central server, which allows for high-speed transactions, deep liquidity, and fiat integration. Such are Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. As convenient and quick to trade, CEXs force the user to leave their money in the hands of the platform to be hacked.\n\nDEXs run on blockchain networks and smart contracts, enabling peer-to-peer trading without a central authority. Users keep control over their money decreasing counterparty risk. Liquidity is dealt with by order books or automated market makers (AMMs). These are Uniswap and dYdX. DEXs are more transparent, secure, and decentralized, although they can be slower in their transactions and have more expensive network charges than CEXs.\n\nHybrid exchanges are built on the combination of CEXs and DEXs features to provide both speed and liquidity with the added non-custodial security. Ordinarily, the way an order matching is conducted is off-chain and then settled on-chain. This is the most optimal solution because it offers the speed of trading, lower charges and enables users to have greater control over funds. The hybrid models are becoming popular to bridge between centralized convenience and decentralized trust.\n\nP2P exchanges connect buyers and sellers directly, allowing them to trade crypto using local currencies or payment methods. The platform usually serves as an escrow service to brush off transactions and fraud. They are Paxful and LocalBitcoins. P2P exchanges offer more options in payment, privacy, and accessibility particularly where banking infrastructure is least developed but might lack liquidity compared to the CEXs.\n\nThe exchange is driven by the backend which deals with trades, liquidity and wallet security, and the front end is to be used to provide the user with a clean, user-friendly interface. The two provide a combination of fast, reliable and safe trading.\n\nCryptocurrency exchange architecture shapes how modern trading platforms operate, from order matching and liquidity flow to wallets, user dashboards, and backend systems. As centralized, decentralized, hybrid, and P2P models grow, the right architectural approach helps ensure smooth trades, consistent performance, and a better trading experience for users.\n\nWith emerging trends like AI-driven trading, Layer 2 networks, cross-chain functionality, and enhanced UX/UI, exchanges are evolving to meet the expectations of both retail and institutional traders. When platforms prioritize strong design, dependable performance, and regulatory alignment, they establish trust and remain competitive in a rapidly evolving market.\n\nIn this landscape, cryptocurrency exchange development is about building a foundation that can adapt to new technologies and industry demands. A well-structured architecture doesn’t just run a platform , it supports long-term growth and shapes the future of your exchange .just run a platform , it supports long-term growth and shapes the future of your exchange.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI is the latest to make a political hire as big tech spreads its tentacles around the world. So what’s the attraction?\n\nGeorge Osborne getting a new job isn’t exactly news. Since leaving frontline politics, the former chancellor has served as the chair of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, edited (not entirely successfully) the Evening Standard, advised asset manager BlackRock, joined boutique advisory firm Robey Warshaw, been appointed as the chair of the British Museum and taken on roles including advising crypto firm Coinbase. Oh, and like any white man of a particular age, he co-hosts a political podcast.\n\nBut Osborne’s latest job is the most eye-opening – and is an alarming augur of what is to come. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, has become the latest organisation to employ Osborne. He will run OpenAI for Countries, a unit tasked with working directly with governments while expanding the company’s Stargate datacentre programme beyond the US. At least it was announced with a tweet, rather than a LinkedIn post.\n\nThe tweet prompted jokes, as did Osborne’s single-handed attempt to boost laggard employment figures brought about by his policies as the chancellor of austerity. But it’s a serious moment, because it’s another sign that the biggest AI firms are starting to behave less like normal companies and more like quasi-governments. They’re negotiating “national” partnerships, pitching a values-led vision of “democratic AI” and hiring former senior politicians as their diplomatic corps. It’s a similar path we have seen from other industries, including oil, pharma and defence, in previous decades – which is why it’s important to try to recognise the risks and head them off before AI companies can repeat the same trick.\n\nThe initiative Osborne is heading up, OpenAI for Countries, does what it says on the tin. It’s designed to embed OpenAI’s models and infrastructure inside the machinery of states, becoming an invaluable, indefatigable part of the running of our lives. OpenAI is in talks with about 50 countries to provide them with critical national infrastructure. Whether you welcome Osborne being put in that role rather than a tech executive is a little like Hobson’s choice: who do you distrust the least? But it’s an indication of how tech companies see their position in society that they are hiring such high-powered people for these roles.\n\nOsborne is not the first to don the branded hoodie and Silicon Valley lifestyle. His fellow coalition government bod Nick Clegg blazed the trail as head of global affairs for Meta. At the time of his initial hiring as a vice-president at Facebook in 2018, his appointment was treated as a PR move – a big name to help the company navigate scandal and scrutiny. But it hinted that platforms had become political actors, whether they liked it or not. The industry’s outsized spending on lobbyists (€151m in Europe alone at the last count) to support the political beasts is an indication of what is at stake. The numbers involved also hint at the scale of the prize that tech companies see: the 10 largest big tech firms now outspend the biggest 10 companies in the pharma, finance and automotive industries combined.\n\nThe former chancellor isn’t even the first former controller of the UK public purse to be handy to big tech. In October of this year, Rishi Sunak took advisory roles with Microsoft and the AI firm Anthropic, less than two years after he convened the AI safety summit at Bletchley Park. Sunak, at least, already had the regulation hoodie in his wardrobe.\n\nYou can read these moves in two ways. The generous interpretation is that these companies are hedging: trying to anticipate tech regulation and ensure they understand it. The more cynical interpretation is that they are attempting to shape the geopolitical story around AI from inside the machine, hiring former leaders less for their technical insight than their institutional muscle memory and networks.\n\nEither way, it leaves democracies with a problem. Governments are supposed to set the rules of the road. But the tech companies they are meant to regulate are on a different scale, planting their feet in different countries. When Sunak convened the Bletchley Park summit, it was notable that he turned interviewer to quiz Elon Musk, sitting starry-eyed on stage as Musk dominated the discourse.\n\nIt’s time to recognise these companies are acting like political actors. That means it’s time to treat them like political actors, too. We need more transparency: governments signing up to OpenAI for Countries agreements should publish the details of their partnerships by default. We should also ask more questions about infrastructure dependence. Governments love Stargate-style investments in their countries, and want to be able to don a hard hat, cut a ribbon and issue a press release. But if they are in effect a new layer of national backbone, they should be studied more closely – as if they are utilities, rather than receive the good grace of a startup-style mystique.\n\nThe more tech companies start to act like politicians and global leaders, the more we need to treat them like it. That doesn’t mean deference; it means more scepticism and journalistic interrogation.\n\nChris Stokel-Walker is the author of TikTok Boom: The Inside Story of the World’s Favourite App",

    "fullText": "Erebor Bank, Palmer Luckey's finance startup backed by some of the biggest names in tech, got one step closer to launching after it cleared another key federal hurdle this week.\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. approved Erebor on December 16 with conditions: The bank is subject to a strict capitalization requirement and must have investors ready to provide more funding if called upon.\n\nThe bank still requires final approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. It received preliminary approval from the OCC in October.\n\nTodd Baker, a senior fellow at Columbia University and a consultant to fintech companies who isn't involved with Erebor, said in an email that he would expect Erebor to get approval to open in early 2026.\n\nBaker said in an email that one of the FDIC's requirements — that the bank invoke a capital-call agreement that would require unnamed parties to chip in more cash if certain triggers occur — is \"highly unusual\" but \"entirely appropriate given the expectation that the bank will be taking on significant risks associated with its tech and crypto-focused business plan.\"\n\nA lawyer listed in regulatory documents as an Erebor spokesperson didn't reply to a comment request.\n\nWith funding from Joe Lonsdale and Peter Thiel, Erebor's valuation was reported to be about $2 billion earlier this year. Regulatory documents showed that the bank has brought on talent from both Luckey's tech circles as well as bank and bank-regulatory circles; earlier this month, a cryptocurrency event featured remarks by Erebor's Suzanne Dannheim, a former Goldman Sachs employee.\n\nErebor's founding team set out an ambitious timeline in its pitch to investors. The bank stressed founder Palmer Luckey's \"political network\" — he has contributed large sums to President Donald Trump and other Republican organizations — as a key asset.\n\nWith this recent round of regulatory approval, it may come close to meeting its proposed timeline.\n\nThe FDIC approval process kicked off on July 28, which means it received a green light in roughly 5 months. The median application processed last year took over eight months.\n\nSeveral other new bank applications emphasizing digital services are pending with the OCC and other regulators.\n\nMichele Alt, a bank-licensing consultant, said Erebor's quick turnaround at the FDIC is cause for celebration.\n\n\"The prior average was indicative of an unnecessarily slow-moving process and highly risk averse bureaucracy,\" she said in an email to Business Insider. \"I'm delighted to see more efficient processing of bank charter applications.\"",

    "fullText": "Peter Schiff warned that Bitcoin is unlikely to find a durable bottom at $50,000.\n\nSchiff argued that Strategy’s valuation is vulnerable to further declines.\n\nMichael Saylor and Strategy have downplayed downside risks and continue to add to their Bitcoin holdings.\n\nBitcoin critic Peter Schiff on Wednesday issued a renewed warning about BTC, arguing that prices will fall well below $50,000 over the long term.\n\nIn the same outburst, Schiff also accused Michael Saylor of disregarding shareholder value as Strategy continues one of the largest corporate Bitcoin accumulation campaigns on record, despite prices falling steeply in recent weeks.\n\nIn a reply on X, Schiff said Bitcoin would not establish a lasting bottom at $50,000, describing that level as merely a short-term reference point.\n\n“No, that’s just a very short-term price target based on MSTR. Long-term Bitcoin will go much lower than $50,000,” Schiff wrote, responding to a user who asked whether prices would rebound after reaching that level.\n\nIn a separate post, Schiff added that Bitcoin would be trading well below $50,000 by the time Strategy’s executive chairman ultimately exits his holdings.\n\n“Bitcoin will be much lower than $50,000 when that happens,” Schiff wrote in response to a user who said they planned to buy once Saylor sells his Bitcoin.\n\nSchiff also targeted Strategy’s stock, arguing that its valuation remains exposed to further downside and is closely linked to Bitcoin’s performance.\n\n“It’s hard to find a chart that looks worse than $MSTR,” Schiff wrote on X. “At a minimum, the stock should drop to about $80, which is half its current price.”\n\nHe added that such a decline in Strategy’s shares would likely coincide with another sharp drop in Bitcoin.\n\n“It’s hard to imagine MSTR dropping that much without a significant decline in Bitcoin as well,” Schiff said. “I’d say a minimum target for BTC is about $50K.”\n\nSchiff has repeatedly argued that Saylor’s Bitcoin-focused strategy prioritizes cryptocurrency exposure over the interests of equity investors.\n\nSaylor and Strategy have consistently minimized perceived risk during periods of Bitcoin volatility.\n\nAfter Bitcoin fell last month, Strategy stated on X that even if BTC declined to its average purchase price of roughly $74,000, the company’s holdings would still cover its outstanding convertible debt multiple times over.\n\nIn November, Strategy CEO Phong Le suggested the company could be forced to sell Bitcoin if its shares traded below the value of its underlying holdings.",

    "fullText": "Crypto markets were already on edge heading into President Donald Trump’s 9 PM EST primetime address to the nation from the White House.\n\nOnchain analysts spotted a large Ethereum move into Binance — the kind of transfer traders often associate with potential selling pressure, even when intentions are unclear.\n\nTrump said he would deliver “an ADDRESS TO THE NATION tomorrow night, LIVE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, at 9 P.M. EST,” in a Truth Social post on Dec. 16.\n\nThe president did not specify a topic for the address, leaving markets to price in uncertainty ahead of the broadcast.\n\nFor crypto traders, high-profile political speeches can act like sudden volatility triggers, not necessarily because of direct crypto policy, but because they can shift expectations around the dollar, rates, risk appetite and market regulation.\n\nThat dynamic can lead some participants to cut leverage or reduce exposure ahead of time.\n\nOn Dec. 17, hours before Trump's 9 p.m. address to the nation, blockchain analytics account Lookonchain reported that a whale wallet “fully exited 10,169 $ETH ($29.7M)” and claimed:\n\n“Over the past 3 years, the whale has made a total profit of $11.36M trading $ETH.”\n\nThe post linked to Arkham Intelligence, where the address page shows a transfer of 10,169 ETH to a Binance deposit destination in recent activity.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ether was trading at $3,014, up 1.8% in a day. Bitcoin was trading at $90,051, up 2.51% in the past 24 hours.\n\nLeaked memo shows popular crypto firm may wind down\n\nBitcoin, XRP slide as traders brace for key U.S. data\n\nAnalyst downgrades MicroStrategy amid higher dilution\n\nLarge holders - often called “crypto whales” - can influence liquidity and short-term price action simply by moving size, especially around major headline events.\n\nIn practice, traders tend to read whale deposits to exchanges as a potentially bearish signal (possible selling), while withdrawals from exchanges are often seen as more bullish (potential long-term holding).\n\nBut those signals can be noisy: whales also move funds for custody changes, collateral management, OTC settlement, or strategic rotation.\n\nWith Trump’s address set for 9 p.m. ET, traders will likely watch two things closely: whether more large wallets send crypto to exchanges in the hours before the speech, and whether derivatives markets show signs of rapid deleveraging.",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame has sounded the alarm on an AI bubble, dismissed bitcoin as \"worthless,\" and revisited his GameStop bet.",
    "fullText": "The mysterious Michael Burry has pulled back the curtain over the past six weeks, revealing his views on everything from bitcoin and meme stocks to the AI boom and the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame was previously known for posting cryptic warnings on X, only to swiftly delete them and go silent for months or years at a time.\n\nHe has now closed his hedge fund to outside cash, and shifted his focus to writing about his personal investments and sharing his financial analyses on Substack.\n\nBusiness Insider trawled through Burry's Substack, X posts, and a recent podcast interview with author Michael Lewis to gather the key insights and details he has shared so far.\n\nBurry returned to X in late October after going quiet in April 2023. His commentary since then has centered on concerns of a historic bubble in AI.\n\nHe has warned that the tech companies leading the charge are seeing a slowdown in cloud-computing growth, overinvesting in equipment such as Nvidia chips and data centers, dragging out depreciation to inflate their short-term earnings, destroying shareholder value through excessive stock-based compensation, and signing \"give-and-take\" contracts with one another to keep the buzz going.\n\nBurry — who shot to fame after his lucrative bet against the mid-2000s housing boom was chronicled by Lewis in \"The Big Short\" — has also compared AI mania to the dot-com and housing bubbles, predicting it too will end in disaster.\n\nHe has labeled OpenAI the \"Netscape of our time,\" saying it's \"hemorrhaging cash.\" He has disclosed bets against market darlings Nvidia and Palantir, and predicted the AI bubble will burst within two years. He has also advised investors who've won big on high-flying assets to cash out their winnings.\n\n\"I think the stock market could be in for a number of bad years,\" he told Lewis during what might be his final interview, per his Substack.\n\nBurry also said that bitcoin trading at $100,000 was \"the most ridiculous thing\" as it's \"not worth anything,\" and called it \"worse than a tulip bulb\" because it has enabled so much crime. The most popular cryptocurrency now trades below $90,000.\n\nOn the other hand, Burry revealed that he has owned gold since 2005, and described Google-parent Alphabet as the \"value investor's favorite\" among mega-cap tech stocks.\n\nBurry told Lewis that the Fed has \"done a lot of damage\" since its founding more than a century ago.\n\nHe said the US central bank doesn't do \"anything very helpful,\" and the Treasury could just have a department to set interest rates and control the money supply instead.\n\nBurry has also warned that the US banking system is showing signs of \"fragility,\" and banks are \"getting weaker way too fast.\"\n\nMoreover, he has defended his past comments on the regional banking fiasco, pandemic-fueled inflation, and a potential meme-stock crash, saying his calls were largely on the money.\n\nHe has shared details of his personal portfolio, including that he has emulated most of his fund's positions and owns shares of Lululemon, Molina Healthcare, Shift4 Payments, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac.\n\nIn a Monday post, he revisited his sale of GameStop shortly before the meme stock skyrocketed in January 2021, saying he had \"no idea what was coming.\" He also teased a future post that will be a \"breakdown of GameStop as an investment today.\"\n\nBurry's other revelations so far include the fact that he has known Nvidia's finance chief, Colette Kress, for years, and bought the chipmaker's stock in 2017 or 2018.\n\nAs promised in his Substack's name, \"Cassandra Unchained,\" Burry is speaking freely for the first time in many years — and may just be getting started.",

    "fullText": "Global macro analyst Luke Gromen, long known for his bullish stance on Bitcoin (BTC) as a hedge against fiat debasement, has adopted a more cautious outlook for the near term.\n\nSpeaking during a recent podcast appearance, Gromen warned that the asset could fall toward the $40,000 range.\n\nDuring the podcast, Gromen stressed that his broader investment thesis has not changed.\n\nHe continues to believe that long-term currency debasement will push investors toward scarce assets such as gold and Bitcoin.\n\nDollar debasement is the decline in the U.S. dollar’s purchasing power due to expanding money supply, inflation, or excessive government debt. This prompts investors to seek scarce assets like Bitcoin (BTC) or gold as protection.\n\nHowever, he now argues that gold and select equities may offer a cleaner expression of that trade than Bitcoin in the coming years.\n\n“Basically everything but gold and the dollar are likely to get waylaid,” Gromen said.\n\nGromen pointed to Bitcoin’s failure to make new highs relative to gold as a key warning sign. The absence of that breakout, he argued, suggests Bitcoin’s risk-reward profile has deteriorated.\n\nTreasury Secretary Bessent to propose major changes that could reshape crypto regulation\n\nAnalyst warns Fed’s $40B monthly Treasury buys could reprice crypto\n\nTeachers union warns new bill could put retirement savings at risk\n\nHe also highlighted a break below key long-term technical levels.\n\nAccording to Gromen, similar technical breakdowns in the recent past were followed by drawdowns, raising concerns that Bitcoin could face a deeper correction if history repeats.\n\n“When these technicals broke, each of the last three times, the median decline in Bitcoin was 65%–70% each time,” he said.\n\n\"The size it had grown in my portfolio, to me it just spoke to me a need to right-size it and substantially reduce positions. Because I think it's going a lot lower.\"\n\nAnother factor weighing on sentiment, according to Gromen, is the growing discussion around quantum computing risks. While most crypto traders consider it as a distant threat to Bitcoin’s cryptography, the topic has gained traction among investors.\n\nGromen suggested that large holders who have accumulated Bitcoin over the past decade may be increasingly inclined to hedge or trim exposure as the narrative gains visibility.\n\n“If I thought quantum was a risk I wanted to at least hedge somewhat, I would start to take some off the table,” he said, pointing to what he perceives as whale selling alongside weak price action.",

    "description": "Quarterly payments of $200 to be offered via stablecoin or traditional currency in a scheme designed to ease cost of living pressures in the Pacific nation",
    "fullText": "Quarterly payments of $200 to be offered via stablecoin or traditional currency in a scheme designed to ease cost of living pressures in the Pacific nation\n\nThe Marshall Islands has introduced a national universal basic income (UBI) scheme that offers payments via cryptocurrency, alongside more traditional methods, which experts say is the first scheme of its kind in the world.\n\nUnder the program, every resident citizen of the Marshall Islands will receive quarterly payments of about US$200 as part of a government effort to ease cost of living pressures. The first instalments were paid in late November and recipients can choose whether the money is paid into a bank account, by cheque, or delivered as cryptocurrency on the blockchain through a government-backed digital wallet.\n\n“We the government want to make sure no one is left behind,” Marshall Islands’ minister for finance David Paul told the Guardian.\n\n“$200 per person per quarter, which is about $800 a year, does not compel you to quit your job … but it’s actually like a morale booster for people.”\n\nAn archipelago in the Pacific Ocean, the Marshall Islands lies between Hawaii and Australia, and has a population of about 42,000. Paul said the payments were intended as a “social safety net” as the country faces rising costs and citizens leaving.\n\nThe UBI scheme is financed by a trust fund created under an agreement with the United States, which in part aims to compensate the Marshall Islands for decades of American nuclear testing. The fund holds more than $1.3bn in assets, with the US committing a further $500m through to 2027.\n\nDr Huy Pham, associate professor and crypto-fintech lead at RMIT University, said the Marshall Islands scheme “is the world first for a national rollout of a UBI program.” He said the use of blockchain technology is “unique in terms of a nation-wide implementation.”\n\nThe cryptocurrency delivery option – which involves the transfer of a digital token known as a stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar – was designed to address the practical challenge of delivering the money across hundreds of remote islands.\n\n“We saw the opportunity in what the blockchain has to offer,” Paul said.\n\nBlockchain is best known as the technology behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but can also be used to store and transfer more traditional assets – like government bonds – which the Marshall Islands is using to underpin their digital payment scheme.\n\nBut according to Pham, digital payments alone do not necessarily provide financial inclusion, especially in a country like the Marshall Islands where internet connectivity is patchy and frequently disrupted.\n\n“Improving internet coverage, improving smartphone penetration – all these kinds of things are the minimum for a blockchain-based economy,” he said.\n\nMost recipients are choosing to receive payments through conventional channels. According to the Marshall Islands Social Security Administration, about 60% of the first round of payments were deposited directly into bank accounts, with the remainder issued as paper checks. Only a small number of people – about 12 so far, officials say – have signed up to receive payments on their digital wallet\n\nAnelie Sarana, the finance manager involved in the rollout, said over the past year her team has travelled to the outermost islands of the country to register people in the scheme.\n\nSarana said many recipients were using the money immediately for basic needs, like food and essentials, while others used the $200 to pay for celebrations to commemorate the annual Gospel Day holiday which coincided with the first distribution.\n\n“I know they’re happy, because you can see in the streets, there’s so much traffic, it’s like there’s a big something happening,” she said.\n\nThis is not the first time the Marshall Islands has experimented with using cryptocurrency. In 2018, the government attempted to create a national cryptocurrency known as the Sovereign, or SOV. The plan ultimately stalled after warnings from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nThe IMF has cautioned that while the technology underpinning the latest scheme is innovative, the blockchain-based delivery of universal basic income carries “financial, fiscal, legal, reputational, and financial integrity risks”, particularly if governance and oversight are not robust.\n\nDr Monique Taylor, a lecturer in world politics at the University of Helsinki, said it was hard to predict if the Marshall Islands’ experiment with a universal basic income and a cryptocurrency delivery system would succeed.\n\n“Universal income schemes are rare, particularly at national scale, and there are no direct precedents that combine this fiscal architecture with a digital delivery component in a small island state,” she said.\n\nBut, she believed the scheme did present benefits for small island nations.\n\n“In a geographically dispersed island state where conventional banking infrastructure can be limited, a digital wallet may lower frictions and make transfers more accessible, particularly in outer atolls,” she said.",

    "fullText": "Caroline Ellison, the former cryptocurrency executive and ex-girlfriend of Sam Bankman-Fried, has been quietly moved out of federal lockup after serving roughly 11 months of her two-year prison sentence, Business Insider has learned.\n\nEllison, 31, was transferred on October 16 from the Danbury Federal Correctional Institution in Connecticut to what's known as community confinement, a Federal Bureau of Prisons spokesperson said.\n\nThat means Ellison, the former CEO of Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research cryptocurrency hedge fund, remains in federal custody but is now either in home confinement or a halfway house, BOP spokesperson Randilee Giamusso told Business Insider.\n\n\"For privacy, safety, and security reasons, we do not discuss the conditions of confinement for any individual, including reasons for transfers or release plans, nor do we specify an individual's specific location while in community confinement,\" Giamusso said.\n\nOnline prison records list Ellison's projected release date as February 20, 2026 — nearly nine months early. Her attorneys declined to comment for this story.\n\nEllison reported to the low-security Danbury prison in early November 2024 to serve a two-year sentence she received for her role in the massive multibillion-dollar fraud scheme that led to the collapse of Bankman-Fried's business empire.\n\nShe had pleaded guilty to conspiring with Bankman-Fried — the founder of the FTX crypto exchange and its sister company, Alameda Research — in the $11 billion fraud scheme.\n\nEllison served as the star witness in Bankman-Fried's 2023 criminal trial, testifying that the pair used Alameda to invest billions of dollars' worth of assets secretly siphoned from FTX customers.\n\nAt Ellison's sentencing hearing, US District Judge Lewis Kaplan praised her \"substantial\" cooperation in the prosecution of Bankman-Fried, but said the seriousness of the case still required prison time.\n\nHer lawyers had asked that the judge not impose any prison time, but Kaplan rejected what he called a \"literal get-out-of-jail-free card.\"\n\nBefore she was sentenced, Ellison, holding back tears, apologized and expressed regret for her participation in the fraud scheme.\n\n\"On some level, my brain doesn't even comprehend all the people I harmed,\" Ellison told the court. \"That doesn't mean I don't try.\"\n\nBankman-Fried was sentenced by Kaplan to 25 years in prison after a jury found him guilty of all seven counts of fraud and conspiracy.\n\nThe FTX founder and former CEO remains behind bars at a low-security federal prison in San Pedro, California, as he appeals his conviction and sentence.\n\nBankman-Fried's lawyers have argued that he should get a new trial after prosecutors unfairly previewed his testimony.",

    "description": "From 2,600% gains to 86% wipeouts: How crypto stock bubble burst",
    "fullText": "What began the year as one of the best trades in the stock market has, in a matter of months, turned into one of the worst.\n\nAn array of public companies thought they had found a sort of perpetual motion machine: Use your corporate cash to buy up bitcoin or other digital tokens and presto, your share price shot up even more than the value of the tokens you bought.\n\nIt was a playbook invented by Michael Saylor, who transformed his company, Strategy Inc., into a publicly traded bitcoin holding vehicle. And through the first half of 2025 it worked for more than a hundred other companies that followed Saylor’s lead.\n\nDigital asset treasuries, as these firms became known, turned into one of the hottest trends in the public markets, as share prices skyrocketed and everyone from Peter Thiel to the Trump family piled in.\n\nOne prominent entrant, SharpLink Gaming Inc., soared more than 2,600% in a matter of days as the company said it would pivot from its old work in gaming, and sell shares to buy up lots and lots of Ethereum tokens, with one of Ethereum’s co-founders as the chairman.\n\nBut it was always hard to explain why tokens should be worth more just because they were held by a public company, and the wheels began to come off the car, at first slowly and then much more quickly.\n\nIn the case of SharpLink, the stock has fallen 86% from its peak, leaving the whole company worth less than the digital tokens it owns. The company now trades at roughly 0.9 times its Ether holdings. It was, at least, spared the fate of Greenlane Holdings, which plunged more than 99% this year, despite its stash of around $48 million BERA crypto tokens.\n\n“Investors took a look and understood that there’s not much yield from these holdings rather than just sitting on this pile of money, and that’s why they contracted,” B. Riley Securities Analyst Fedor Shabalin said in an interview.\n\nAmong the U.S. and Canadian-listed companies that became digital asset treasuries, the median stock price has fallen 43% this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bitcoin, by comparison, is down around just 6% since the beginning of the year.\n\nSome lucky digital asset treasuries are still worth more than their underlying holdings, but most have been losers for people who bought them when they were anywhere near their peaks and 70% are on track to end the year below where they began it, according to Bloomberg’s calculations.\n\nThe worst performers have been public companies that eschewed bitcoin and went for smaller, more volatile tokens.\n\nTwo of Trump’s sons lined up behind Alt5 Sigma Corp., a public company that set out to buy more than a billion dollars of WLFI, a token issued by a separate company that was co-founded by the Trump family. Those shares have fallen about 86% from their peak in June.\n\nThe volatility of these stocks is explained, at least in part, by all the money that was borrowed to pay for the corporate crypto acquisitions.\n\nStrategy came up with a remarkable array of convertible bonds and preferred shares that funded the company’s bitcoin purchases, with the tokens growing to be worth more than $70 billion at one point. Digital asset treasuries as a group raised more than $45 billion this year to purchase crypto tokens, according to Shabalin at B. Riley.\n\nNow, though, Strategy and all the other companies are on the hook to make the interest and dividend payments on that debt. That is a problem because their crypto holdings, for the most part, don’t generate any cash flow.\n\n“If you own Strategy, you own the bitcoin risk plus whatever kind of corporate stress, corporate risk they are taking on,” RIA Advisors Portfolio Manager Michael Lebowitz said in an interview.\n\nStrategy has recently tried to raise more capital to keep the flywheel spinning, turning to Europe in November to sell perpetual preferred stocks at a discount, after U.S. preferred shares sales fell short of expectations. But those euro-denominated preferred stocks have already fallen below their offer price.\n\nMeanwhile, for smaller digital asset treasuries without name recognition, capital raising opportunities are even harder to come by as crypto prices decline and investor enthusiasm wanes.\n\nFor Strategy, the obvious next step is to sell some of its crypto holdings to pay the bills. And that is what Saylor’s chief executive officer, Phong Le, said the company might do.\n\n“We can sell bitcoin and we would sell bitcoin if we needed to fund our dividend payments,” Le said on a podcast.\n\nLe said he will look at this option if the company’s so-called mNAV falls below 1, a calculation that would suggest the company’s market value has fallen below the value of its crypto holdings.\n\nThese comments shook the digital asset treasury industry because Saylor had said many times that he would not sell his bitcoin, and would buy more when the price went down.\n\n“Sell a kidney if you must, but keep the Bitcoin,” he joked in a February post on X.\n\nThe big concern now is that digital asset treasuries will be forced to sell their crypto, which will push down the prices of those tokens, setting off a downward spiral.\n\n“If there’s a headline that says Strategy sold, even if it’s three bitcoin, I think after everything Michael Saylor has said about he’s never selling a dime, people are going to start to question the whole bitcoin trade,” Lebowitz said.\n\nStrategy has created a $1.4-billion reserve fund to cover dividend payments in the near term. And shares are still up more than 1,200% since it started buying bitcoin in August 2020. But they are on track for a 38% decline this year.\n\nThe digital asset treasury wipeout risks bleeding into broader markets if traders are using borrowed money, which could force them to sell in order to cover margin calls. For now, the problems have largely cut off the flow of new companies adopting the strategy — and the burst of capital markets activity that it created.\n\nBut there are signs that there may be at least some new activity from somewhat more valuable digital asset treasuries acquiring smaller digital asset treasuries that are worth less than their holdings.\n\nStrive Inc., co-founded by former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, agreed to acquire Semler Scientific Inc. in an all-stock deal in September, merging the two bitcoin treasury companies. Semler was one of the first digital asset treasuries and has fallen 65% this year.\n\nRoss Carmel, a partner at Sichenzia Ross Ference Carmel, expects that mergers and acquisitions will pick up for digital asset treasuries in early 2026 with a focus on the potential for further pain.\n\nThe industry is likely to see more structured securities transactions “that can be used to give these investors more downside protection in these deals,” Carmel said.",

    "fullText": "New analysis suggests Bitcoin’s four-year cycles have been replaced — and the world’s biggest cryptocurrency could rebound to $140,000 at some point in the next 180 days.\n\nAccording to Copper, the arrival of exchange-traded funds tracking BTC’s spot price have changed this digital asset’s behavior, and given way to what it calls the “cost-basis returns cycle.”\n\n“Across 2024/2025, Bitcoin has exhibited the same repeatable pattern: price breaks to new all-time highs, corrects sharply, and then finds support almost perfectly at its ETF investor cost basis before beginning the next expansion.”\n\nThe company’s analysis suggests we have seen this play out three times since these ETFs launched back in January 2024 — with each cycle delivering returns of more than 60%.\n\nCopper also claims this has exposed a significant divide between crypto-focused traders and institutional investors, with some Bitcoin commentators claiming it is “the worst bull market ever.”\n\nSo… what exactly causes these sharp corrections once BTC enters price discovery mode? Well, its analysis suggests that institutions rebalancing their portfolios is primarily to blame — an activity that “transforms Bitcoin’s volatility into realized returns.”\n\n“Institutions are not ‘staking sats’ — in fact, most do not care about sats at all now that Bitcoin is accessible through equities-style ETF shares. They care about risk-adjusted contribution to a portfolio.”\n\nGenerally speaking, it’s been recommended that institutions allocate somewhere between 2% and 5% into Bitcoin — but a sudden surge in price can have a huge impact.\n\n“Without rebalancing, a modest 2% Bitcoin allocation drifts to 6.2% in less than 180 days during these cycles. A 5% allocation drifts dangerously close to double-digit.”\n\nCopper’s head of research Fadi Aboualfa told Cryptonews that Bitcoin is now at a critical juncture.\n\n“With BTC now trading near its $84,000 cost basis, that pattern points to a move north of $140,000 in the next 180 days. If cost basis rises 10% to 15% as in prior cycles, the resulting premium seen at past peaks produces a target range of $138,000 to $148,000.”\n\nThe prospect of a return to all-time highs within the next six months would provide a much-needed dose of “hopium” for traders. However, other analysts have warned there are few catalysts that can drive BTC forwards at the moment. The Federal Reserve’s recent 0.25 percentage point interest rate reduction was largely priced in, with policymakers suggesting there may only be one cut in 2026.\n\nA big test will concern what happens if Bitcoin’s value falls below its cost basis for ETF investors — and whether sell-offs would intensify if institutions spent a prolonged period in the red.",

Its launch is the latest crypto move from the bank, which also recently tokenized some private equity investments in October.\n\nIt's also the latest crypto push from Wall Street broadly. Asset management titans, including Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and BlackRock, have also been offering crypto investments and blockchain solutions for clients.\n\nJPMorgan will commit $100 million of its own capital to the fund before officially opening it up to investors on December 16.\n\nDespite some skepticism from CEO Jamie Dimon over the years, the bank has made inroads into crypto and has been recently bullish on the price of bitcoin. JPMorgan analysts said recently that bitcoin could buck its latest downtrend and reach $170,000 in 2026.\n\nAsset tokenization has been in focus in 2025, with platforms like Robinhood framing it as a means of trading more efficiently or potentially gaining exposure to private investments.\n\nThe passing of the GENIUS Act, meanwhile, has offered support for stablecoins, a key component for tokenized funds like MONY.",

    "description": "Ethereum price trades near a breakout zone as selling pressure eases. Key levels now decide whether $4,000 comes into play.",
    "fullText": "Ethereum price action looks quiet, but the entire formation is slowly turning bullish. Over the past 24 hours, ETH has traded almost flat, while the past seven days show a modest 2.6% gain. Price has remained above $3,100 for several sessions, suggesting strength rather than exhaustion.\n\nThis sideways move is not random. Ethereum is compressing near key levels, where breakouts often form. The next move depends on whether buyers, who are gradually returning, can turn this consolidation into a continuation.\n\nEthereum appears to be breaking out after consolidating inside a bull flag. A bull flag forms when the price pauses after a strong upward move, then trades in a narrow range before the next leg higher. This pattern signals consolidation, not weakness.\n\nThe structure remains intact as long as ETH holds above $3,090. That means, unless there is a daily candle close below this level, the much-anticipated breakout might hold.\n\nThis level has acted as firm support, absorbing selling pressure during recent pullbacks. Price has repeatedly bounced from this zone, showing buyers are still defending it.\n\nWant more token insights like this? \n\nA clean daily close above $3,130 would be the first confirmation that the flag is resolving higher. That move would signal that consolidation is ending and buyers are regaining control. Without that close, Ethereum remains in compression, but the bullish structure stays valid.\n\nOn-chain data support the price structure. Holder Net Position Change, which tracks whether long-term investors are adding or selling ETH, shows that selling pressure has eased compared to earlier sessions.\n\nOn December 12, Ethereum holders distributed roughly 958,771 ETH. By December 13, net selling dropped to around 877,958 ETH, marking a decline of roughly 8.4% in selling pressure within 24 hours.\n\nThat shift matters. Ethereum is still seeing net distribution, but the pace of selling is slowing as the price compresses near resistance. This behavior typically appears during late-stage consolidation, not during breakdowns.\n\nWhen selling pressure eases near a key level without price slipping lower, it increases the odds that buyers step in once a breakout confirms. Ethereum is not seeing panic exits. Instead, holders appear more willing to wait.\n\nIf the Ethereum price secures a daily close above $3,130, the next resistance sits near $3,390. Clearing that zone would open the path toward the $4,000–$4,020 area, aligning with the measured move from the bull flag structure.",

    "fullText": "Rachel Reeves wants to protect consumers by bringing digital money and assets into the ‘regulatory perimeter’\n\nCryptocurrencies will be regulated in a similar way to other financial products under legislation coming into force in 2027.\n\nThe Treasury is drawing up rules that will require crypto companies to meet a set of standards overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\n\nMinisters have sought to overhaul the crypto market, which has ballooned in popularity as a way of investing money and making payments.\n\nCryptocurrencies have not been subject to the same regulation as traditional financial products such as stocks and shares, which means that in many cases consumers do not enjoy the same level of protection.\n\nThe government said the new rules would make the crypto industry more transparent, boost consumer confidence and make it easier to detect suspicious activity, impose sanctions and hold companies accountable.\n\nRachel Reeves, the chancellor, said: “Bringing crypto into the regulatory perimeter is a crucial step in securing the UK’s position as a world-leading financial centre in the digital age.\n\n“By giving firms clear rules of the road, we are providing the certainty they need to invest, innovate and create high-skilled jobs here in the UK, while giving millions strong consumer protections, and locking dodgy actors out of the UK market.”\n\nCrypto companies, which can include crypto exchanges and digital wallets, must register with the FCA if they provide services that fall within the scope of the UK’s money-laundering regulations.\n\nThe changes mooted by the Treasury will bring companies that provide crypto services into the remit of the FCA and mean the services are regulated in the same way as other financial products, including by being subject to transparency standards.\n\nLucy Rigby, the minister for the City of London, said: “We want the UK to be at the top of the list for crypto assets firms looking to grow and these new rules will give firms the clarity and consistency they need to plan for the long term.”\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has suffered from turbulence amid growing investor fears about a potential artificial intelligence bubble.\n\nBanking industry data in October showed that the amount of money lost to investment scams by UK consumers had surged by 55% in a year, with fake cryptocurrency thought to top the list.\n\nA Chinese woman living in the UK was convicted in September over a multibillion-pound bitcoin fraud.\n\nZhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, orchestrated a fraud in China between 2014 and 2017 that left 128,000 people out of pocket. The 45-year-old stored the proceeds in bitcoin but UK authorities made a breakthrough in the case when they raided a Hampstead mansion in 2018 and seized devices from Qian holding 61,000 bitcoins, worth more than £5bn at current prices.\n\nThe Metropolitan police believe it is the largest single cryptocurrency seizure in the world. Qian pleaded guilty at Southwark crown court on Monday to acquiring and possessing cryptocurrency that was criminal property.\n\nMinisters are also drawing up plans to ban political donations made with cryptocurrency, amid concerns that it is difficult to determine their origin and ownership.\n\nNigel Farage’s Reform UK, which became the country’s first party to accept contributions in digital currency this year, is believed to have received its first registrable donations in cryptocurrency this autumn. It has set up a crypto portal to receive contributions, saying it is subject to “enhanced” checks.\n\nReform this month received £9m from Christopher Harborne, a cryptocurrency investor and businessman based in Thailand – the largest donation made by a living person to a British political party.",

    "description": "The presumed pseudonymous Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, disappeared without a trace on this day in 2010.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nDespite the colossal influence of cryptocurrencies on commerce, computing, and even politics, the true identity of the presumed pseudonymous Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, remains a mystery in 2025. Making things trickier for identity sleuths, this individual (or perhaps the name represents a group?) disappeared without a trace on this day in 2010, that’s exactly 15 years ago.\n\nThough the last public message from the BTC founder was about technical matters, an email that appears to be from Nakamoto's account was sent to a fellow Bitcoin enthusiast, Mike Hearn, in April 2011. It began with an explanation for absence, of sorts, with the first line reading \"I've moved onto other things.\"\n\nBenjamin Wallace, the author of The Mysterious Mr. Nakamoto: A Fifteen-year Quest to Unmask the Secret Genius behind Crypto, wrote earlier this year that the BTC creator’s defining moment was the publication of an article on November 1, 2008.\n\nOn that day, the nine-page-long Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was shared on a little-known crypto mailing list. Its significance: it would solve the double-spending problem, which had cryptographers in knots for decades prior.\n\nIn essence, Nakamoto proposed a public ledger using blockchain that would prevent fraudulent copying and thus double-spending of any digital asset. This peer-to-peer system would be developed and refined by the BTC creator over the following months before their disappearance.\n\nWherever they are or however they live today, the most famous name in crypto history may also be one of the wealthiest entities in the world. Recently cited as the 11th-richest ‘person,’ Nakamoto is thought to still hold the majority of the 1.1 million BTC they mined in the currency’s first year.\n\nToday, that crypto fortune would be worth about $99 billion. However, BTC valuations have recently slid to around $90,000 after several months of oscillation around the $110,000 to $120,000 level.\n\nNakamoto’s BTC fortune has remained unspent since 2010, while its valuation has fluctuated wildly. This incredible level of HODLing has led analysts to believe the BTC creator has either passed away or has tragically lost access to the crypto. Others still believe Nakamoto is intentionally maintaining an absolute silence.\n\nBitcoin has no expiration mechanism, with no timeouts, no inactivity penalties, or other kind of reversion to the network. Moreover, there seems to be no quantum or other new-fangled computer cryptography tech that is anywhere near breaking the SHA-256 algorithm. Thus, these coins may indeed remain inaccessible to anyone other than Nakamoto for the next 20–40 years.\n\nHowever, the situation could change if any of the founders’ coins are ever moved or spent. Such an action would cause a stir in itself. Still, it would also expose the public key of that specific coin, creating a more vulnerable attack surface for a sufficiently powerful future quantum computer.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.",

Mangione's possessions, as described during the hearing, included a MacBook laptop, an iPhone, multiple thumb drives, and a small circuit board wrapped in cardboard.\n\nIt had not been previously revealed that Mangione may have been into crypto. Still, he once gained a small following among crypto investors.\n\nSoon after his arrest, a LUIGI memecoin was launched in his name, and quickly surged in value, reaching a $60 million market capitalization, according to multiple contemporaneous accounts in the crypto press.\n\nJust as quickly, it cratered; a $1,000 investment made at the coin's launch, in mid-December 2024, would be worth about $25 now.\n\nMangione's evidence suppression hearing is scheduled to start its third week on Tuesday.",

    "fullText": "One of Wall Street's biggest bitcoin cheerleaders has significantly dialed down his forecast for the crypto.\n\nGeoff Kendrick of Standard Chartered, who previously said he saw bitcoin climbing as high as $200,000 by the end of 2025, told clients in a note that the bank has aggressively slashed its price forecasts for bitcoin through the end of the decade.\n\nKendrick said the bank's view is now for bitcoin to end this year at around $100,000, implying 6% upside from the crypto's current levels.\n\nFor next year, he see bitcoin hitting $150,000, about half of the prior target of $300,000.\n\nHere's the rundown of where Standard Chartered thinks the token is headed over the next five years:\n\nThe price target changes were largely spurred by bitcoin's recent sell-off, Kendrick, the global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, wrote in a note on Tuesday. The crypto is down around 27% from its peak in early October.\n\nHe said that bitcoin treasuries — firms that buy and hold bitcoin on their balance sheets — likely won't support the price of the cryptocurrency going forward. Instead, the token will have to rely primarily on ETF buying to move higher, he added.\n\n\"Price action has forced us to recalibrate our Bitcoin price forecasts,\" Kendrick wrote, adding that the firm believed bitcoin treasury buying had \"run its course,\" though ETF inflows could pick up \"periodically.\"\n\nIt's been a rough year for bitcoin, which was rocked earlier in the year as markets reacted to tariffs, and has been weighed down by worries about higher inflation and fewer Fed rate cuts in 2026.\n\nIts latest decline has been brought on by a handful of bearish factors, like low liquidity in the market, a risk-off mood amid rate-cut uncertainty, and speculation that Strategy, the largest corporate buyer of bitcoin, could have to sell some of its token.",

While many saw it as a message to the West on international sanctions, the country has taken targeted steps to open its economy to the world’s largest cryptocurrency.\n\nDuring an investment conference in Moscow on Dec. 4, 2024, Putin argued that the influence of the dollar on the global economy was waning, paving the way for the growth of other instruments.\n\n“For instance – Bitcoin. Who can prohibit its use? No one,” Putin said. “Or the use of other electronic ways of settlement. No one can ban the use of them.”\n\nPutin added that the new instruments would “continue developing” regardless of what happens to the dollar.\n\nDon’t Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nShortly after these comments, Russia’s Finance Minister Anton Siluanov revealed that Russian companies have started using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for cross-border transactions, described as a response to trade disruptions from sanctions imposed after the Ukraine war.\n\nThe minister said that it was possible to use the Bitcoin mined in Russia in foreign trade.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Putin greenlighted Bitcoin mining in the country earlier that year. He previously rejected the central bank's proposal to ban cryptocurrencies in 2022, arguing that the country possesses \"competitive advantages\" in the field of mining.\n\nIn accordance with Putin’s directives, the central bank proposed in March of this year to allow a limited number of “highly qualified” Russian investors to purchase and sell cryptocurrencies under a new three-year experimental legal regime.\n\nThe bank maintained that it still doesn’t see cryptocurrency as a means of payment and proposed a ban on all cryptocurrency transactions between Russian residents outside the experimental regime.\n\nSee Also: Fast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share\n\nHowever, recent developments suggest attempts to expand cryptocurrency access for Russians.

    "description": "MSCI could exclude crypto treasury firms from its widely followed indexes. The move is drawing sharp criticism from industry players.",
    "fullText": "A possible move by indexing giant MSCI to exclude crypto treasury companies from its widely followed indexes is drawing fierce backlash from the industry.\n\nMSCI is considering excluding companies that have 50% or more of their assets invested in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. The index provider announced the plans in October, with a decision on the move potentially to come in January.\n\nMSCI argues that crypto treasury companies are more like investment funds than operating companies. The idea has drawn opposition from Michael Saylor's Strategy, as well as Viek Ramaswamy's Strive Asset Management.\n\nBitcoin prices have been volatile lately, with the potential for fresh struggles among companies that accumulate crypto being eyed as another headwind for the market.\n\nCrypto market players told Business Insider they see MSCI's move as a mistake.\n\nAdam Levine, CEO of digital asset infrastructure firm Fireblocks, said that MSCI's plan likely won't play well with institutional investors that have warmed to digital assets in recent years, and who could be forced to rebalance their holdings that track the index.\n\n\"When major indexes leave out companies that work with digital assets in a meaningful way, they're introducing the potential of missing key market players at a time when more businesses are innovating with stablecoins and tokenized equity,\" he stated. \"It's equivalent to intentionally ignoring early internet companies 30 years ago.\"\n\nWhile the implications for DATs could be severe if MSCI decides to exclude them from its indexes, sources say bitcoin can still recover from its bear market.\n\nWojciech Kaszycki, chief strategy officer at blockchain infrastructure firm BTCS S.A., predicts that a bitcoin rebound is coming, and others say MSCI's potential move has been baked into the market's outlook already.\n\n\"Decisions by MSCI and other index providers have real implications for digital asset treasuries and, by extension, the underlying crypto they hold,\" said Spencer Hallarn, head of OTC trading at crypto market maker GSR. \"That said, this potential move has been well telegraphed, so it's reasonable to assume the market has already priced it in and that it's unlikely to come as a surprise.\"",

    "description": "These flows represent a bullish bet on volatility rather than a downside hedge or outright bearish position.",
    "fullText": "Deep out-of-the-money (OTM) bitcoin (BTC) put options are lighting up in longer-dated expiries, as traders pick up cheap lottery tickets for potential moonshot payoffs if BTC swings wild.\n\nOn leading crypto options exchange Deribit, the $20,000 strike put is the second most popular among the June 2026 expiry options, boasting a notional open interest of over $191 million.\n\nNotional open interest is the dollar value of the number of active contracts. Put options at strikes below the going market rate of BTC are said to be OTM. These OTM puts tend to be cheaper than those near or above the spot price of BTC.\n\nThe June expiry also sees significant activity in other OTM puts at $30,000, $40,000, $60,000, and $75,000 strikes.\n\nActivity in deep OTM puts is typically read as traders bracing for a price crash. But that's not necessarily the case here, as the exchange has also seen activity on higher-strike calls above $200,000.\n\nTaken together, these flows represent a bullish view on long-dated volatility at low cost rather than a bet on price direction, according to Deribit's Global Head of Retail Sidrah Fariq. Think of it as cheap lottery tickets on a potential volatility explosion over the next six months.\n\n\"There is about 2,117 open interest on the $20K bitcoin put for the June expiry. We also saw some big trades in the $30,000 put and $230,000 call strikes. The combination of these far out of the money options does not suggest directional trading, but rather deep wing trades that professionals use to trade long-dated volatility cheaply and adjust tail risk in their books,\" Fariq told CoinDesk.\n\nShe explained that it's essentially volatility positioning, not price positioning, because the $20,000 put or the $230,000 call are simply too far from the spot price to be a purely protective hedge. As of writing, BTC changed hands near $90,500, according to CoinDesk data.\n\nThose holding both OTM calls and puts could score asymmetric payoffs from extreme volatility or wild price swings in either direction. But if markets stay flat, these options quickly lose value.\n\nOptions are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A put option provides the right to sell and represents a bearish bet on the market. A call offers the right to buy.\n\nThe crypto options market, including the one tied to BlackRock's IBIT ETF, has evolved into a sophisticated arena where institutions and whales engage in three-dimensional chess, managing risk and profiting from price direction, time decay, and volatility swings.\n\nBroadly speaking, the options market mood appears bearish, as BTC puts continue to trade at a premium to calls across all tenors, according to Amberdata's options risk reversals. This is at least partly due to persistent call overwriting, a strategy aimed at boosting yield on top of spot market holdings.",
