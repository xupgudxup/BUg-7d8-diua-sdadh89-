The world's largest cryptocurrency is down nearly 20% year-to-date.\n\nBitcoin dropped sharply last weekend to notch its fourth straight month of losses.\n\nThe move lower coincided with President Trump's announcement last Friday selecting Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve when Jerome Powell's term ends in May, a nomination markets view as hawkish.\n\nEther (ETH-USD) and other digital tokens also slid.\n\nAfter bitcoin earlier broke through the key support level at $73,000, 10X Research strategists wrote that \"current flows suggest sentiment has shifted meaningfully.\"\n\nThe firm's strategists pointed to flow and positioning data, which indicated \"investors are not yet positioned to buy the dip.\"\n\n\"While sentiment and technical indicators are approaching extreme levels, the broader downtrend remains intact,\" the researchers wrote. \"In the absence of a clear catalyst, there is little urgency to step in.\"\n\nThe firm noted that traders remain focused on deleveraging and unwinding their positions rather than on preparing for a typical snapback rally.\n\nPressure on digital assets reflected the broader fragility across the crypto market.

    "description": "Risk assets more broadly were under pressure, with tech stocks to crypto sliding in choppy trading.",
    "fullText": "Silver prices slumped as precious metals came under renewed pressure amid a broader market pullback.\n\nThe spot silver price was 9.2% lower around $80.05 per troy ounce at 2:27 a.m. ET on Thursday. Prices had dropped as much as 17% earlier in the session.\n\nThursday's slide erased two days of gains for the white metal, which plunged as much as 36% on Friday at the height of the selloff.\n\nThe drop marks a sharp reversal for a market that had been on a tear just days earlier, with silver hitting a record high above $121 per ounce last week.\n\nGold also retreated, slipping below the $5,000 level to trade around $4,934 per ounce.\n\nPrices of the precious metals came amid a rise in the US Dollar Index to a two-week high, which makes dollar-denominated commodities pricier.\n\n\"The inverse relationship between precious metals and the US dollar has reasserted itself, leaving gold and silver particularly sensitive to near-term FX moves,\" wrote Ewa Manthey, a commodities strategist at ING on Tuesday.\n\n\"Looking ahead, the dollar is likely to remain a key driver of short-term price action, with precious metals broadly moving in the opposite direction,\" she added.\n\nAnalysts warn that silver is likely to remain especially volatile, as the market is far smaller than gold — a dynamic that can amplify price swings.\n\nEven before Friday's selloff, hedge funds had already been trimming long positions in silver and other metals, with managed money reducing exposure to surging metals and reallocating into energy and other commodities.\n\nIn other corners of the market, risk assets more broadly were under pressure, with tech stocks and cryptocurrencies sliding in choppy trading.\n\nSoftware stocks came under pressure this week after Anthropic unveiled a new AI tool capable of handling clerical and administrative work in the legal sector. Legal software companies bore the brunt of the initial selloff, before losses rippled through the wider software space.\n\n\"In addition to accelerating layoffs of jobs replaced by AI solutions, software continues to sell off as advances in quick AI solutions threaten all but those players with major moats around their client relationships,\" wrote Louis Navellier at Navellier & Associates on Wednesday.\n\nStephen Parker, co-head of global investment strategy at JPMorgan Private Bank, told CNBC on Wednesday that the tech selloff reflects a healthy rotation, with investors pivoting away from a tech-driven market in search of better opportunities elsewhere.\n\nThe tech selloff spilled over into Asia with tech stocks. On Thursday, Samsung Electronics and SoftBank Group Corp. falling by 6% and 7% respectively.\n\nBitcoin was trading around $71,200, down roughly 7% over the past 24 hours and about 19% lower over the last seven days.",

    "fullText": "Michael Saylor’s $10 million Bitcoin claim sparks backlash.\n\nIt comes as Strategy’s losses deepen as Bitcoin price slides.\n\nWhether Saylor will sell Bitcoin remains possible.\n\nMichael Saylor, executive chairman of the Bitcoin-focused firm Strategy, is facing renewed criticism. He claimed that BTC would surge to $10 million “tomorrow” if people agreed with his views.\n\nThis comes even as his company’s Bitcoin holdings slide into multibillion-dollar unrealized losses and its share price continues to fall.\n\nThe comments, made in a recent video, have drawn sharp backlash online as tension between Saylor’s long-term Bitcoin thesis and the financial strain on Strategy’s balance sheet reaches boiling point.\n\nIn the video, Saylor described Bitcoin’s price volatility as a feature rather than a flaw, arguing it benefits committed investors while deterring short-term participants.\n\n“Volatility was a gift to the faithful,” Saylor said, adding that sharp price swings scare away “tourists” and those unwilling to commit time and effort to understanding Bitcoin.\n\nSaylor went on to suggest that Bitcoin’s price was being held back by a lack of consensus.\n\n“If people in the rest of the world knew what I know, and they understood and they agreed with me, Bitcoin would go to $10 million tomorrow,” he said.\n\nHe argued that such a move would ultimately harm long-term investors by eliminating years of opportunity to accumulate Bitcoin at lower prices.\n\n“I want you to think about how you would feel and how your viewers would feel, because you would lose 20 years of stacking opportunity during which you get to buy it less than $10 million,” he said.\n\nSaylor’s remarks triggered a wave of criticism on social media, where users questioned his logic and mindset as Bitcoin’s price continues to fall.\n\nOne post responded sarcastically: “If everyone knew what I knew and agreed with me about the value of something I own I’d be worth $10 trillion.”\n\nAnother compared Bitcoin to speculative bubbles of the past, writing: “Very sad for those that follow him. At least tulips are beautiful.”\n\nOther critics focused on technical and economic concerns surrounding Bitcoin.\n\nOne user said Saylor ignored “non-competitive energy costs versus AI, halving destroying miner economics, and increasing centralization.”\n\nAnother called Saylor “the most insufferable person on the planet right now.”",

    "description": "Bitcoin crashes below $73,000 amid technical breakdown, altcoin selloff, and regulatory uncertainty wiping billions from crypto portfolios.",
    "fullText": "Crypto portfolios just took a gut punch. Bitcoin briefly crashed below $73,000 on Tuesday, hitting $72,900—its lowest point since November 2024—before clawing back to around $75,658. That 6% intraday nosedive wiped out another chunk of what’s already been a brutal year, with Bitcoin now down 16% year-to-date. If you’re feeling like you’re watching your digital gold turn to digital dust, you’re not alone.\n\nFunding rates hit extreme zones while support levels that seemed solid start looking like mirages.\n\nThe technical picture looks about as appetizing as gas station sushi. Funding rates on Binance entered what analysts call an “extreme zone,” signaling traders are piling into short positions faster than people abandoning Twitter for BlueSky. Key resistance now sits at $74,000, while support hovers somewhere between $69,000 and $72,800—levels that feel as reliable as a crypto influencer’s price predictions. Volatility is spiking after a year of relative calm, because apparently the market decided boring was overrated.\n\nEthereum and XRP investors discover that diversification doesn’t work when everything moves in lockstep.\n\nWhile Bitcoin nurses a 4% daily bruise, altcoins are getting absolutely demolished. Ethereum dropped 25% over the past week, with XRP down 17%—proving once again that “altcoin season” often means “altcoin suffering season.” The carnage stems from a perfect storm of geopolitical jitters, the U.S. government shutdown scrambling economic data releases, and regulatory uncertainty that has investors fleeing anything riskier than Treasury bills.\n\nAnalysts offer conflicting views on whether fundamentals can overcome technical breakdown.\n\nRob Hadick from Dragonfly Capital argues the pullback “doesn’t appear driven by any single factor” and points to strong fundamentals from stablecoins and tokenized assets. Meanwhile, Alex Thorn at Galaxy Digital warns Bitcoin “may continue to drift lower” toward the 200-week moving average near $58,000. That’s a 20% drop from current levels—the kind of distance that separates hopeful hodlers from actual capitulation. With supply gaps gaping between $70,000-$80,000, this correction might have more room to run than anyone wants to admit.\n\nFrom the coolest cars to the must-have gadgets, GadgetReview’s daily newsletter keeps you in the know.

    "fullText": "It's entirely possible you missed the recent meltdown in bitcoin. Not to project, but there were other sell-offs in the likes of gold and silver sucking up most of the oxygen and attention. First Trade flicked at the losses, but it's time to give what's happened its full due.\n\nThe most recent damage absorbed by bitcoin came after the nomination of Kevin Warsh as the Federal Reserve's new chair. Warsh is viewed as a hawk — especially when it comes to the size of the central bank's balance sheet — and hawkishness is bad for risk assets like crypto.\n\nThe Warsh development explains the latest leg down, which pushed the price of bitcoin to its lowest level since Trump's election victory in November 2024.\n\nBut that's just the last 10% or so, in the last few days. What about the nearly-30% plunge in the several months before that?\n\nIn the fourth quarter of last year, investors rotated out of riskier assets like tech stocks and crypto. This coincided with the Fed taking a more conservative tone around future rate cuts, after having already eased multiple times in 2025.\n\nBut as stocks have since recovered to a series of fresh records, bitcoin has continued to flounder. Blame crypto-specific headwinds like delays in the passage of key crypto-regulation measures.\n\nAnd then there are the bitcoin-treasury firms, most notably Strategy, which have positioned their businesses around amassing as much of the crypto as possible. As the price of bitcoin has tumbled, so has speculation that these big institutions could be forced to sell in size.\n\nThe level to watch is $76,000. That's the average that Strategy has paid for its tokens. If the price of bitcoin has fallen below it, that means the firm is sitting on paper losses. The mere prospect of that has investors on edge.\n\nThe commentary surrounding the latest bitcoin sell-off has been less than encouraging. John Blank, the chief strategist at Zacks Investment Research, says the token could sink all the way to $40,000 — about 45% below current levels. He also laid out three reasons why the ongoing crypto winter could last for months longer.\n\nEven famed \"Big Short\" investor Michael Burry got in on the action. He didn't explicitly call for further losses in bitcoin, instead focusing on a trio of \"sickening\" scenarios that could play out if the crypto keeps falling.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, bitcoin is in a tough spot right now. What happens with Strategy, and how far below their market net asset value it can trade, will be top of mind for investors.\n\nIn the meantime, the crypto market is only enticing for traders looking to bottom-fish. Fortune does tend to favor the bold, but you'd have to have serious guts to buy in right now.",

    "description": "Ripple unlocked 1 billion XRP from escrow as the token extended losses amid a broader crypto market downturn.",
    "fullText": "Ripple unlocked roughly 1 billion XRP (XRP) from escrow on February 1, continuing its long-standing monthly release schedule.\n\nThe scheduled unlock followed a weak close for XRP in January, when the token declined by more than 10%. Selling pressure extended into the new month, with prices slipping further in line with the broader market drawdown.\n\nAccording to on-chain data, the unlocks were split across four transfers of 100 million, 400 million, 100 million, and 400 million XRP, with a combined value of approximately $1.6 billion at the time of execution.\n\nRipple’s monthly unlocks are part of a structured supply management mechanism rather than an unexpected market event. Introduced in 2017, the system placed 55 billion XRP into escrow, allowing up to 1 billion XRP to be released each month in a transparent and predictable manner.\n\nUnder this framework, Ripple typically relocks between 60% and 80% of the unlocked tokens, retaining only a portion for operational expenses or liquidity demands. That pattern repeated this month.\n\nWhale Alert reported that Ripple relocked 700 million XRP to escrow in two separate transactions totaling 400 million and 300 million XRP, worth roughly $1.09 billion combined. As a result, a net 300 million XRP remains unlocked following the sequence.\n\nHistorically, these monthly escrow movements have had a limited immediate impact on the market. Nonetheless, XRP has been under pressure as overall risk appetite weakened across the market.\n\nBeInCrypto Markets data showed that XRP’s value declined by 10.6% in January, with the price falling to a low of $1.50 on the final trading day of the month, marking its lowest level since the October market crash.\n\nJust two days into February, XRP has already dropped by more than 6%, tracking the broader market downturn that has pushed Bitcoin and Ethereum to multi-month lows. At press time, XRP was trading at $1.57, down nearly 5% over the past 24 hours.\n\nAmid the ongoing drawdown, analysts remain split on whether a recovery or further declines are more likely. One analyst noted that XRP may be repeating a familiar long-term cycle. This suggests its next major rally may still be several years away.\n\nAccording to the analysis, XRP has historically moved through extended consolidation phases before breaking out sharply later in the cycle.\n\n“It is following the same patterns in every other cycle. The next pump won’t be until Q4 2028. $8–10+,\" the analyst wrote.",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin miners globally are facing increasing challenges to stay afloat in their business.\n\nThe whole Bitcoin-halving gambit and the volatility of crypto as a whole, thanks to geopolitical tensions, are making many miners move away from the business to something more sustainable, like artificial intelligence.\n\nThey have the machines, they have the power, so why not pivot?\n\nOne Bitcoin miner is facing an even bigger trouble, like a double-edged sword: bankruptcy and leadership turmoil.\n\nA Russian court has placed the parent company of BitRiver, the country’s largest Bitcoin mining firm, under official bankruptcy supervision.\n\nBitRiver was once a symbol of Russia’s industrial-scale crypto ambitions. At one point, it oversaw 15 data centers with a combined capacity of 533 megawatts and controlled over 50% of the domestic Bitcoin mining market, according to HSE Center for Electric Power Research. The company reported more than 10 billion rubles ($131.6 million) in revenue in 2024, before its power lines began to dim.\n\nOn Jan. 27, the Sverdlovsk Regional Arbitration Court initiated monitoring procedures for Fox Group of Companies LLC, which owns 98% of BitRiver Management Company, according to a report by Kommersant.\n\nInfrastructure of Siberia, part of energy conglomerate En+ Group, filed the bankruptcy petition over a canceled equipment supply deal. The firm paid more than 700 million rubles (approx. $9.1 million) in advance for mining hardware that never arrived.\n\nAfter the contract was terminated, courts sided with En+ in April 2025, but enforcement efforts found no recoverable assets, prompting the bankruptcy filing. BitRiver’s accounts were later frozen, a move legal experts warned could “paralyze operations,” Kommersant reported.\n\nLeading miner walks away from Bitcoin\n\nNasdaq sends delisting threat to another crypto firm\n\nAbundant Mines CEO says post-halving Bitcoin mining will look different\n\nThe En+ dispute is just one part of BitRiver’s broader financial unraveling. The company faces mounting electricity debts and multiple lawsuits from energy suppliers.\n\nCourts are reviewing claims totaling more than 940 million rubles ($12.2 million), including 133 million from En+ Sbyt, 640 million from the Irkutsk Electric Grid Company, and 168.7 million already awarded to NTEK. Regional utilities under Rosseti have also filed collection suits.\n\nBitRiver’s internal structure has deteriorated in parallel. Layoffs began in early 2025, followed by salary delays and executive resignations.",

    "fullText": "A famed crypto influencer has predicted Bitcoin’s price could fall to $30,000.\n\nThe comments come after a global market crash.\n\nTechnical signals have reinforced the bearish outlook.\n\nAnalysts and prominent market commentators have warned of deeper losses for Bitcoin following a violent sell-off across global financial markets that wiped out trillions of dollars in value.\n\nOn Thursday, well-known crypto influencer Crypto Bitlord warned that Bitcoin could fall significantly further, identifying $30,000 as the next major support level.\n\n“The next major support for bitcoin is $30k,” the X account wrote.\n\nBenjamin Cowen, founder of crypto analytics platform Into The Cryptoverse, echoed the bearish outlook, saying Bitcoin’s weakness aligns with historical trends and macroeconomic tightening.\n\n“Today, we’re going to talk about Bitcoin and discuss why the price is dropping and why I think it will likely continue to drop,” Cowen said in a recent YouTube video.\n\nCowen said he believes Bitcoin has already transitioned into a bear market after peaking in October 2025.\n\n“I do think Bitcoin is, in fact, in a bear market,” he said.\n\nBitcoin’s slide comes amid a broader global market rout that saw roughly $3 trillion in market value erased in less than an hour on Thursday.\n\nPrecious metals, despite recent historic rallies, were not spared.\n\nGold lost around $1.5 trillion in market value, with prices falling nearly 10% from recent highs, while silver fell about 12%.\n\nLongtime Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff took his chance to weigh in on BTC’s falling, arguing that the asset has significantly underperformed gold over the long term despite growing institutional support.\n\n“Bitcoin is now worth just 15.5 ounces of gold, down 57% from its 2021 high and just 10% above its 2017 high,” Schiff wrote.\n\n“Despite all the hype and support from Wall Street and the Trump administration, most people who now own Bitcoin would have been better off buying gold or silver instead,” he added.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, analysts say Bitcoin’s chart structure has deteriorated further.\n\nVictor Olanrewaju, an analyst at CCN, said Bitcoin confirmed a bearish reversal pattern on the daily chart after breaking key support levels.\n\n“From a technical perspective, Bitcoin’s price extended its sell-off, breaking below the $86,400 neckline and confirming a head-and-shoulders breakdown on the daily chart,” Olanrewaju said.",

    "fullText": "Every time the crypto market enters a dramatic phase, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood is one of the first investors I turn to in order to understand the changing dynamics on the charts.\n\nWood is a veteran investor in the digital assets market. In fact, she claimed that ARK Invest was the first public asset manager to gain Bitcoin (BTC) exposure in 2015.\n\nBitcoin hadn't reached even the $500 price mark in 2015, but it was a significant uptick since its launch in 2009. But Wood's pro-crypto move was met with sharp criticism.\n\nHowever, the confidence seems to have paid off over the years as Bitcoin kept hitting new highs. ARK Invest estimates the cryptocurrency's price will hit $1 million in 2030.\n\nWood also keeps buying shares of crypto companies such as:\n\nCoinbase (Nasdaq: COIN), the largest crypto exchange in the U.S.\n\nRobinhood Markets (Nasdaq: HOOD), an e-trading platform with crypto and tokenized stock offerings\n\nBlock (NYSE: SQ), Jack Dorsey's Bitcoin technology company\n\nBitmine Immersion Technologies (NYSE: BMNR), the world's largest Ethereum (ETH) treasury company\n\nBullish (NYSE: BLSH), the crypto exchange backed by Peter Thiel\n\nGiven Wood's deep expertise in crypto investments, it is worth understanding her perspective in the wake of Bitcoin's crash below $80,000 on Jan. 31.\n\nLorenzo Valente, ARK Invest's Director of Research, Digital Assets, recently shared an analysis in which he compared gold's market cap as a percentage of the U.S. M2 money supply.\n\nM2 is a broad measure of the U.S. money supply (cash, checking, savings, money market funds).\n\nAs per the analysis, gold's market cap is 170% of the entire U.S. money supply right now.\n\nThe figure is an all-time high (ATH); in fact, it is as high as it was in 1934 during the Great Depression and only slightly above the figure in 1980 when inflation peaked, the chart showed.\n\nIn simple words, gold is as expensive as it can be. Such peaks usually happen during periods of economic stress and dollar regime shift and often mark turning points, Valente said. For instance, gold crashed 60% after 1980.\n\nEven right now, it feels like a \"pivot moment\" and while nobody knows what happens next, those who know can make huge gains, he added.\n\nWhen ARK Invest shared its 2026 outlook on Jan. 15, the asset manager noted that the correlation between the Bitcoin and gold prices has been very low at 0.14 since early 2020.\n\nThis is exactly what Wood reiterated in response to Valente's X post. In simple terms, Bitcoin and gold usually don't move together on a daily or monthly basis.",

    "description": "Bitcoin fell toward $83,000 as the U.S. entered a partial shutdown, with traders leaning defensive ahead of a House vote expected Monday.",
    "fullText": "Crypto prices remained under pressure on Friday as the U.S. government entered a partial shutdown after lawmakers missed a midnight funding deadline, adding another layer of uncertainty to a market already struggling to find buyers.\n\nBitcoin traded around $83,559, up about 1% on the day but down roughly 6.8% over the past week, according to the price screen.\n\nEther sat near $2,686, down about 1.9% in the past 24 hours and 9% on the week. XRP changed hands near $1.72, down about 1.6% on the day and close to 10% lower over seven days.\n\nThe shutdown itself looks short. The Senate passed a funding package, but the House is out until Monday, so the government will still hit a technical lapse over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Saturday that it would operate with \"very limited staff\" from Jan. 31 onward due to the shutdown.\n\nThat timing matters for risk assets because it lands right into thin weekend liquidity and a heavy headline cycle, which may pressure bitcoin and the broader crypto market over the weekend.\n\nThere is also a clean crypto angle here that is not just “risk off.” Prediction markets have spent the past 24 hours showing how messy the definition of “shutdown” can get.\n\nTraders on Polymarket and Kalshi were forced to think like lawyers. The government can be “shut” on paper at 12:01 a.m. and still look normal to most people for two days. That gap between legal status and real-world impact is exactly where contract wording and settlement rules start to bite.\n\nFor crypto, the shutdown headline is more of a sentiment stress test than a direct economic shock. It keeps traders cautious, pushes people toward smaller position sizes, and makes dips feel heavier because buyers do not want to step in front of a weekend news tape.",

    "fullText": "Long-term Bitcoin holders are selling a lot right now, putting downward pressure on the price.\n\nThe market has absorbed much of this selling so far, with big buyers stepping in to support it.\n\nA full crash is unlikely in the near term, but Bitcoin could still drop further if selling continues.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has started 2026 on shaky ground, grinding between $88,000 and $90,000 after falling hard from its $124,000 peak.\n\nAs the market searches for a clear direction, one storyline is dominating the conversation.\n\nLong-term Bitcoin holders (LTHs)—investors who have held BTC for at least 155 days—may be starting to sell in size.\n\nIf that trend holds, it could add fresh pressure to an already fragile market and fuel fears that a deeper pullback is still ahead.\n\nAccording to Glassnode data, Bitcoin long-term holders are dumping BTC faster than during the October 2025 crash.\n\nOver the past 30 days, these LTHs have sold approximately 143,000 BTC, valued at around $9.5 billion at current prices.\n\nThis marks the fastest pace of divestment since August 2025, reversing a brief accumulation phase from late December 2025 to early January 2026.\n\nGlassnode’s data shows that mid-term holders (1-5 years) are still offloading supply, while longer-term holders (over 5 years) show signs of stabilization or even minor accumulation.\n\nFor instance, the BTC supply that has been inactive for over five years increased by 95,500 coins in the last month, suggesting that not all veteran holders are panicking.\n\nHowever, this selling adds supply to the market and puts downward pressure on prices.\n\nCryptoQuant echoes this, noting that LTH sales began when prices surpassed $40,000, distinguishing this cycle from previous bull markets where holders were more steadfast.\n\nBitcoin’s price weakness isn’t isolated to LTH behavior. Over 22% of BTC supply is held at a loss, a level last seen in early 2022 and mid-2018, heightening sensitivity to further declines.\n\nShort-term holders (STHs), who are price-sensitive, are particularly vulnerable; their spent output profit ratio sits at 0.99, just below breakeven, suggesting potential capitulation if support breaks.\n\nGlassnode warned that failure to hold key levels, such as the -1 standard deviation of the STH cost basis or the true market mean, could resume LTH selling.\n\nMacro factors add layers of complexity to the current bearish market trends.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged despite a depleting dollar.\n\nInstitutional inflows via spot ETFs have been mixed, with $1.3 billion in outflows recently, yet firms like Strategy have absorbed over 40,000 BTC in 2026 alone.",

    "fullText": "Advertising Standards Authority says firm advised by George Osborne ‘trivialised risks of cryptocurrency’\n\nA cryptocurrency company advised by George Osborne has been banned from showing a set of adverts that suggested using its services could be a solution to the cost of living crisis.\n\nCoinbase, which appointed the former Conservative chancellor to chair its global advisory council last year, has been told by the UK’s advertising watchdog that its adverts were “irresponsible” and “trivialised the risks of cryptocurrency”.\n\nThe adverts from the US crypto exchange include a sarcastic two-minute video showing people singing “everything is just fine, everything is grand” as their home falls into a state of disrepair and suffers a power cut, while outside Britons cheerfully dance through streets littered with rats and piles of overflowing bin bags.\n\nAs the ad progresses, a shopper faces rising prices for fish fingers in a supermarket, white-collar workers lose their jobs, a sewage pipe bursts and rubbish falls from the sky.\n\nThe clip ends with large text saying: “If everything’s fine, don’t change anything”, before being replaced with the Coinbase logo. The company, which was founded in 2012, provides a platform for people to buy and sell various cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the advertising campaign, which launched in August, implied that using Coinbase could be an alternative to the financial concerns associated with the cost of living, and so trivialised the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies.\n\n“We considered that using humour to reference serious financial concerns, alongside a cue to ‘change’, risked presenting complex, high-risk financial products as an easy or obvious response to those concerns,” it said.\n\nOsborne was appointed in December to run Coinbase’s global advisory council to assist with the company’s lobbying in the UK and EU, having already been an adviser to the company for the past two years.\n\nThe company’s chief policy officer at the time said Osborne would play an “active role in helping us with policymakers around the world”. Last August, the former Tory MP had written a column in the Financial Times warning that the UK has been left behind in the cryptocurrency boom and is in danger of missing a second wave of demand.\n\nThe former politician last month added a role at ChatGPT developer OpenAI to his portfolio of positions, which also includes being the chair of the British Museum and a co-host of a podcast with the former Labour minister Ed Balls.\n\nThree posters from Coinbase were also banned by the ASA, which in large letters stated: “Home ownership out of reach,” as well as “real wages stuck in 2008” and “eggs now out of budget”. Small white background text read: “Everything is fine”repeatedly. The bottom of the poster said: “If everything’s fine, don’t change anything” next to the Coinbase logo.\n\nNeither the video nor the posters contained any information about the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies, the ASA said, despite the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority warning that cryptocurrency is “largely unregulated and high risk, and that buyers should be prepared to lose all of their money”.\n\nThe video advert by Coinbase had already been banned from television by Clearcast, which approves television ads in the UK, but the ASA said it had been shown on multiple online platforms, while the posters had been displayed in “high-traffic areas such as the London Underground and rail stations”.\n\nA spokesperson for Coinbase said: “While we respect the ASA’s decision, we fundamentally disagree with the characterisation of a campaign that critically reflects widely reported economic conditions as socially irresponsible.\n\n“The advert was intended to provoke discussion about the state of the financial system and the need to consider better futures, not to offer simplistic solutions or minimise risk.\n\n“While digital assets are not a panacea, we believe their responsible adoption can play a constructive role in a more efficient and freer financial system. Coinbase remains committed to authentic, thought-provoking communication and to operating responsibly within the UK’s regulatory framework.”",

    "title": "\"Bitcoin Jesus\" Avoided Prison, Thanks to One of the \"Friends of Trump\"",
    "description": "Billionaire fugitive Roger Ver was facing federal criminal charges until he sought the services of a select club of President Donald Trump’s former personal attorneys who have easy access to top Justice Department appointees.",
    "fullText": "These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nDays into President Donald Trump’s second term in the White House, a cryptocurrency billionaire posted a video on X to his hundreds of thousands of followers. “Please Donald Trump, I need your help,” he said, wearing a flag pin askew and seated awkwardly in an armchair. “I am an American. … Help me come home.”\n\nThe speaker, 46-year-old Roger Ver, was in fact no longer a U.S. citizen. Nicknamed “Bitcoin Jesus” for his early evangelism for digital currency, Ver had renounced his citizenship more than a decade earlier. At the time of his video, Ver was under criminal indictment for millions in tax evasion and living on the Spanish island of Mallorca. His top-flight legal defense team had failed around half a dozen times to persuade the Justice Department to back down. The U.S., considering him a fugitive, was seeking his extradition from Spain, and he was likely looking at prison.\n\nOnce, prosecutors hoped to make Ver a marquee example amid concerns about widespread cryptocurrency tax evasion. They had spent eight painstaking years working the case. Just nine months after his direct-to-camera appeal, however, Ver and Trump’s new Justice Department leadership cut a remarkable deal to end his prosecution. Ver wouldn’t have to plead guilty or spend a day in prison. Instead, the government accepted a payout of $49.9 million — roughly the size of the tax bill prosecutors said he dodged in the first place — and allowed him to walk away.\n\nVer was able to pull off this coup by taking advantage of a new dynamic inside of Trump’s Department of Justice. A cottage industry of lawyers, lobbyists and consultants with close ties to Trump has sprung up to help people and companies seek leniency, often by arguing they had been victims of political persecution by the Biden administration. In his first year, Trump issued pardons or clemency to dozens of people who were convicted of various forms of white-collar crime, including major donors and political allies. Investigations have been halted. Cases have been dropped.\n\nWithin the Justice Department, a select club of Trump’s former personal attorneys have easy access to the top appointees, some of whom also previously represented Trump. It has become a dark joke among career prosecutors to refer to these lawyers as the “Friends of Trump.”\n\nThe Ver episode, reported in detail here for the first time, reveals the extent to which white-collar criminal enforcement has eroded under the Trump administration. The account is based on interviews with current and former Justice Department officials, case records and conversations with people familiar with his case.\n\nThe Trump administration has particularly upended the way tax law violators are handled. Late last year, the administration essentially dissolved the team dedicated to criminal tax enforcement, dividing responsibility among a number of other offices and divisions. Tax prosecutions fell by more than a quarter, and more than a third of the 80 experienced prosecutors working on criminal tax cases have quit.\n\nBut even amid this turmoil, Ver’s case stands out. After Ver added several of these new power brokers to his team — most importantly, former Trump attorney Chris Kise — Trump appointees commandeered the case from career prosecutors. One newly installed Justice Department leader who had previously represented Trump’s family questioned his new subordinates on whether tax evasion should be a criminal offense. Ver’s team wielded unusual control over the final deal, down to dictating that the agreement would not include the word “fraud.”\n\nIt remains the only tax prosecution the administration has killed outright.\n\nVer did not reply to an extensive list of questions from ProPublica. In court filings and dealings with the Justice Department, Ver had always denied dodging his tax bill intentionally — a key distinction between a criminal and civil tax violation — and claimed to have relied on the advice of accountants and tax attorneys.\n\n“Roger Ver took full responsibility for his gross financial misconduct to the tune of $50 million because this Department of Justice did not shy away from exposing those who cheat the system. The notion that any defendant can buy their way out of accountability under this administration is not founded in reality,” said Natalie Baldassarre, a Justice Department spokesperson.\n\nIn response to a list of detailed questions, the White House referred ProPublica to the Justice Department.“I know of no cases like this,” said Scott Schumacher, a former tax prosecutor and the director of the graduate program in taxation at the University of Washington. It is nearly unheard of for the department to abandon an indicted criminal case years in the making. “They’re basically saying you can buy your way out of a tax evasion prosecution.”\n\nRoger Ver is not a longtime ally of Trump’s or a MAGA loyalist. He renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2014, a day he once called “the happiest day of my entire life.” In the early days of bitcoin, he controlled about 1% of the world’s supply.\n\nVer is clean-cut and fit — he has a black belt in Brazilian jujitsu. In his early 20s, while he was a libertarian activist in California, Ver was sentenced to 10 months in prison for illegally selling explosives on eBay. He’s often characterized that first brush with the law as political persecution by the state. After his release, he left the U.S. for Japan.\n\nVer became a fixture in the 2010s on the budding cryptocurrency conference circuit, where he got a kick out of needling government authority and arguing that crypto was the building block of a libertarian utopia. At a 2017 blockchain conference in Aspen, Colorado, Ver announced he had raised $100 million and was seeking a location to create a new “non-country” without any central government. For years, Ver has recommended other wealthy people consider citizenship in the small Caribbean nation of Saint Kitts and Nevis, which has no individual income tax.\n\n“Bitcoin completely undermines the power of every single government on the entire planet to control the money supply, to tax people’s income to control them in any way,” he told a gathering of anarcho-capitalists in Acapulco, Mexico, in 2016. “It makes it so incredibly easy for people to hide their income or evade taxes.” More than one friend, he said with a smirk, had asked him how to do so: They “say, ‘Roger, I need your help. How do I use bitcoins to avoid paying taxes on it?’”\n\nRenouncing U.S. citizenship isn’t a magic get-out-of-tax-free technique. Since 2008, the U.S. has required expatriates with assets above $2 million pay a steep “exit tax” on the appreciation of all their property.\n\nIn 2024, the Justice Department indicted Ver in one of the largest-ever cryptocurrency tax fraud cases. The government accused Ver of lying to the IRS twice. After Ver renounced his citizenship in 2014, he claimed to the IRS that he personally did not own any bitcoin. He would later admit in his deal with the government to owning at least 130,664 bitcoin worth approximately $73.7 million at the time. Then in 2017, the government alleged, Ver tried to conceal the transfer of roughly $240 million in bitcoin from U.S. companies to his personal accounts. In all, the government said he had evaded nearly $50 million in taxes.\n\nVer’s defense was that his failure to pay taxes arose from a lack of clarity as to how tax law treated emerging cryptocurrency, good-faith accounting errors and reliance on his advisors’ advice. He claimed it was difficult to distinguish between his personal assets and his companies’ holdings and pinpoint what the bitcoin was actually worth.\n\nThe Biden administration’s Justice Department dismissed this legal argument. Prosecutors had troves of emails that they said showed Ver misleading his own attorneys and tax preparers about the extent of his bitcoin holdings. (Ver’s team accused the government of taking his statements out of context.) The asset tracing in the case was “rock solid,” according to a person familiar with the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. A jury, prosecutors maintained, was unlikely to buy Ver’s defense that he made a good-faith error.\n\nIn Trump, Ver saw a possible way out. After the 2024 election, he was “barking up every tree,” said his friend Brock Pierce, a fellow ultrawealthy crypto investor who tried to gin up sympathy for Ver in Trump’s orbit.\n\nVer had initially gone the orthodox route of hiring tax attorneys from a prestigious law firm, Steptoe. Like many wealthy people in legal jeopardy, Ver now also launched a media blitz seeking a pardon from the incoming president.“If anybody knows what it’s like to be the victim of lawfare it’s Trump, so I think he’ll be able to see it in this case as well,” Ver said in a December 2024 appearance on Tucker Carlson’s show. On Charlie Kirk’s show, Ver appeared with tape over his mouth with the word “censored” written in red ink. Laura Loomer, the Trump-friendly influencer, began posting that Ver’s prosecution was unfair. Ver paid Trump insider Roger Stone $600,000 to lobby Congress for an end to the tax provision he was accused of violating.\n\nVer’s pardon campaign fizzled. His public pressure campaign — in which he kept comparing himself to Trump — was not landing, according to Pierce. “You aren’t doing yourself any favors — shut up,” his friend recalled saying.\n\nOne objection in the White House, according to a person who works on pardons, may have been Ver’s flamboyant rejection of his American citizenship. Less than a week after Trump was inaugurated, Elon Musk weighed in, posting on X, “Roger Ver gave up his US citizenship. No pardon for Ver. Membership has its privileges.”\n\nBut inside the Justice Department, Ver found an opening. The skeleton key proved to be one of the “Friends of Trump,” a seasoned defense lawyer named Christopher Kise. Kise is a longtime Florida Republican power player who served as the state’s solicitor general and has argued before the U.S. Supreme Court. He earned a place in Trump’s inner circle as one of the first experienced criminal defenders willing to represent the president after his 2020 election loss. Kise defended Trump in the Justice Department investigation stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and against charges that Trump mishandled classified documents when leaving the White House.\n\nKise had worked shoulder-to-shoulder on Trump’s cases with two lawyers who were now leaders in the Trump 2.0 Justice Department: Todd Blanche, who runs day-to-day operations at the department as deputy attorney general, and his associate deputy attorney general, Ketan Bhirud, who oversaw the criminal tax division prosecuting Ver. Kise reportedly helped select Blanche to join Trump’s legal team in the documents case, and he and Bhirud had both worked for Trump’s family as they fought civil fraud charges brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James in 2022.\n\nOn Ver’s legal team, Kise worked the phones, pressing his old colleagues to rethink their prosecution against Ver.\n\nKise scored the legal team’s first big victory in years: a meeting with Bhirud that cut out the career attorneys most familiar with the merits of the case.\n\nIn that meeting, however, it wasn’t clear that the new Justice Department leadership would be willing to interfere with the trajectory of Ver’s case. While the Trump administration had backed off aggressive enforcement of white-collar crimes writ large, the administration said it was still pursuing most criminal cases that had already been charged.\n\nBhirud initially expressed skepticism that Ver accidentally underpaid his taxes. It was “hard to believe” that a man going by “Bitcoin Jesus” would have no idea how much bitcoin he owned, Bhirud said, according to a person familiar with the case.\n\nBhirud and Blanche did not respond to detailed questions from ProPublica.\n\nThe Justice Department stuck to its position that either Ver would plead guilty to a crime, or the case would go to trial.\n\nBut Kise would not stop lobbying his former colleagues to reconsider. Blanche and Bhirud had already demanded that career officials justify the case again and again. Over the course of the summer, Kise wore down the Trump appointees’ zeal for pursuing Ver on criminal charges.\n\nKise and the law firm of Steptoe did not respond to questions.\n\n“While there were meetings and conversations with DOJ, that is not uncommon. The line attorneys remained engaged throughout the process, and the case was ultimately resolved based on the strength of the evidence,” said Bryan Skarlatos, one of Ver’s tax attorneys and a partner at Kostelanetz.\n\nIt was a chaotic moment at the Justice Department, an institution that Trump had incessantly accused of being “weaponized” against him and his supporters. After Trump took office, the department was flooded with requests to reconsider prosecutions, with defendants claiming the Biden administration had singled them out for political persecution, too.\n\nWhile many cases failed to grab the administration’s attention, Kise got results. Last week, Kise’s client Julio Herrera Velutini, a Venezuelan-Italian billionaire accused of trying to bribe the former governor of Puerto Rico, received a pardon from Trump.\n\n“Every defense attorney is running the ‘weaponization’ play. This guy gets an audience because of who he is, because his name is Chris Kise,” said a person who recently attended a high-level meeting Kise secured to talk the Justice Department down from prosecuting a client.\n\nAs Kise stepped up the pressure, Ver’s case ate up a significant share of Bhirud’s time, despite his job overseeing more than 1,000 Justice Department attorneys, according to people familiar with the matter. Ordinarily, it would be rare for a political appointee to be so involved, especially to the exclusion of career prosecutors who could weigh in on the merits.\n\nBhirud began to muse to coworkers about whether failure to pay one’s taxes should really be considered a crime. Wasn’t it more of a civil matter? It seemed to a colleague that Bhirud was aware Ver’s advocates could try to elevate the case to the White House.\n\nThe government ceded ground and offered to take prison time off the table. Eventually, Ver’s team and Bhirud hit on the deal that would baffle criminal tax experts. They agreed on a deferred prosecution agreement that would allow Ver to avoid criminal charges and prison in exchange for a payout and an agreement not to violate any more laws. The government usually reserves such an agreement for lawbreaking corporations to avoid putting large employers out of business — not for fugitive billionaires.\n\nVer’s team enjoyed a remarkable ability to dictate terms. They rejected the text of the government’s supposed final offer because it required him to admit to “fraud,” according to a person familiar with the negotiations. In the end, Ver agreed to admit only to a “willful” failure to report and pay taxes on all his bitcoin and turned over the $50 million.\n\nThe government arrived at that figure in a roundabout manner. It dropped its claim that Ver had lied on his 2017 tax return. The $50 million figure was based on how much he had evaded in taxes in 2014 alone, plus what the government asserted were interest and penalties. In the end, the deal amounted to the sum he allegedly owed in the first place. He never even had to leave Mallorca to appear in a U.S. court.\n\nUnder any previous administration, convincing the leadership of the tax division to drop an indicted criminal case and accept a monetary penalty instead would be a nonstarter. While the Justice Department settles most tax matters civilly through fines, when prosecutors do charge criminal fraud, their conviction rate is over 90%.\n\nPeople “always ask you, ‘Can’t I just pay the taxes and it’ll go away?’” said Jack Townsend, a former DOJ tax attorney. “The common answer that everybody gave — until the Trump administration — was that, no, you can’t do that.”\n\nWhen the Justice Department announced the resolution in October, it touted it as a victory.\n\n“We are pleased that Mr. Ver has taken responsibility for his past misconduct and satisfied his obligations to the American public,” Bhirud said in the Justice Department’s press release announcing the deferred prosecution agreement. “This resolution sends a clear message: whether you deal in dollars or digital assets, you must file accurate tax returns and pay what you owe.”\n\nInside the Justice Department, the resolution was demoralizing: “He’s admitted he owes money, and we get money, but everything else about it stinks to high heaven,” said a current DOJ official familiar with the case. “We shouldn’t negotiate with people who are fugitives, as if they have power over us.”\n\nAmong the wealthy targets of white-collar criminal investigations, the Ver affair sent a different message. Lawyers who specialize in that kind of work told ProPublica that more and more clients are asking which of the “Friends of Trump” they should hire. One prominent criminal tax defense lawyer said he would give his clients a copy of Ver’s agreement and tell them, “These are the guys who got this done.”\n\nThe only one of Ver’s many lawyers to sign it was Christopher Kise.",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) traded higher on Thursday as global risk sentiment improved after US President Donald Trump walked back his plan to impose new tariffs on European allies amid his push to acquire Greenland.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation (BTC-USD) rose about 1% over the past 24 hours to hover near $90,000 (£66,902), moving in tandem with equities in Asia and Europe. The broader cryptocurrency market cap climbed 2.7% to $3.18tn over the same period, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signalled a diplomatic shift on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, saying he would not pursue military action to acquire Greenland and had reached “the framework of a future deal” on the Danish territory with NATO allies.\n\nThe remarks injected fresh volatility into crypto markets. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell to an intraday low near $87,300 before rebounding back toward $90,000 as traders reassessed US trade policy risks and broader macro conditions. More than $625m in leveraged crypto positions were liquidated over 24 hours, split roughly evenly between longs and shorts across about 150,000 traders, according to Coinglass market data.\n\nAnalysts said the episode underscored how digital assets are reacting more directly to geopolitical and macro headlines.\n\n“Today’s sharp price swings highlight how closely crypto markets are tracking geopolitical and policy developments,” said Rachel Lin, CEO of SynFutures, noting that Trump’s signals on Greenland negotiations and a pause on potential EU tariffs “briefly improved global risk sentiment, prompting a rapid rebound in bitcoin alongside US equities”.\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo Finance UK, Lin added that while the move was headline-driven, “they reflect a deeper shift in market structure”, describing bitcoin (BTC-USD) as “increasingly behaving like a macro asset, reacting to changes in policy expectations and broader risk appetite”.\n\nOver the longer term, she said, institutional participation is supporting bitcoin’s (BTC-USD) evolution as “a maturing and globally relevant asset class, even amid elevated volatility”.\n\nGlobal equities rallied as Trump withdrew his threat to impose additional 10% tariffs on eight European countries, including the UK, after receiving what he called the “framework of a future deal” in NATO discussions regarding Greenland.\n\nIn Asia, Japan’s Nikkei gained nearly 2%, while South Korea’s Kospi broke above the 5,000 level for the first time. European markets opened higher, with the FTSE 100 up 0.7% at the open.",

Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-Imagn Images\n\nThe Suns entered Wednesday’s matchup coming off a 113-108 loss to the Santa Cruz Warriors on Monday. With rookies Rasheer Fleming and Khaman Maluach, along with two-way player Jamaree Bouyea, assigned back to the team, the Valley hoped the trio would provide the spark needed to get back on track.\n\nFleming and Maluach had been traveling with the Phoenix Suns throughout the six-game road trip, earning minutes whenever the team needed them. Bouyea is coming off concussion protocol and has not played since early January.\n\nHowever, Wednesday’s game allowed the rookies to flourish with increased playing time.\n\nOct 24, 2025; Inglewood, California, USA; Los Angeles Clippers center Yanic Konan Niederhauser (14) defends Phoenix Suns center Khaman Maluach (10) in the second half at Intuit Dome. Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-Imagn Images\n\nIn the first half alone, Fleming posted 13 points, three rebounds and two steals. Maluach added eight points and six rebounds but dealt with foul trouble, picking up three fouls before halftime. Bouyea struggled early but found a rhythm late in the half, finishing with nine points, two rebounds, and two assists at the break.\n\nDespite limited minutes, Bouyea’s strong finish to the first half suggested he was simply shaking off rust.\n\nThe Suns opened the second half on an 18-0 run, partly by Bouyea’s eight points. He finished the night with 27 points, while Fleming finished with 19 points and Maluach finished with 23.\n\nNov 24, 2025; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Phoenix Suns forward Rasheer Fleming (20) against the Houston Rockets at Mortgage Matchup Center. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nThe trio put up great numbers, as their fatigue from travel didn’t last long. Head coach Paul Jesperson acknowledged their earlier game struggles, especially Bouyea, as Wednesday was his first official night in a Valley Suns uniform.\n\n“We knew there was probably going to be a little fatigue there and a little bit of those guys just having to feel the game out a little bit as it progressed,” he said post-game. “I think [Bouyea] did exactly that. Kind of found his spots, got comfort level [and] got a little energy to him.”\n\nThe Suns finish out the week with a matchup against the Texas Legends on the road on Friday, Jan. 23, at 6:30 p.m.\n\nWM Phoenix Open brings golf to streetwear with Samba shoe collab",

    "fullText": "Silver surged roughly 165% in 2025, driven by industrial shortages and soaring demand.\n\nPeter Schiff argues Bitcoin will mirror silver’s rally—but in reverse, with a sharp collapse.\n\nCrypto supporters dismiss the warning, pointing to Schiff’s long record of failed Bitcoin predictions.\n\nAs silver continues to print record highs, longtime gold advocate and Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff is once again sounding the alarm.\n\nThis time, he is warning that BTC is headed for a collapse that will mirror silver’s rise, only in reverse.\n\nSilver climbed above $94 on Jan. 19, extending a surge that has reshaped the precious metals market over the past year.\n\nSince late 2024, the metal has posted new highs with striking frequency, fueled by tight supply and growing industrial demand.\n\nThe rally has been dramatic. Silver rose about 165% in 2025 and is already up roughly 30% in the first three weeks of 2026 alone, adding an estimated $1.2 trillion in market value.\n\nSchiff seized on the milestone to deliver another stark warning for Bitcoin holders.\n\n“What’s happening with silver is about to happen with Bitcoin, only in reverse,” Schiff wrote on X. “Silver’s spectacular rise will usher in Bitcoin’s catastrophic collapse. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.”\n\nThe comment immediately reignited debate between traditional asset proponents and crypto supporters, a familiar battleground for Schiff, who has spent years criticizing Bitcoin as fundamentally worthless.\n\nSilver’s rally has been driven less by speculation and more by real-world demand pressures.\n\nThe metal plays a critical role in solar panels, electric vehicles, and advanced electronics, sectors that have expanded rapidly as governments and corporations invest heavily in green energy and AI infrastructure.\n\nDemand from data centers and semiconductor manufacturing has further strained supply, creating persistent deficits that have pushed prices higher.\n\nBitcoin, by contrast, has struggled to match silver’s momentum.\n\nDespite a brief rally earlier this month that pushed BTC above $97,000, the asset has failed to sustain a breakout.\n\nBroader market uncertainty, including renewed trade tensions sparked by President Donald Trump’s tariff threats, has kept risk assets under pressure.\n\nWhile Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest through ETFs and ongoing legislative efforts in Washington.\n\nIts growing correlation with equities has limited upside during periods of macro stress.\n\nSchiff’s bearish stance on Bitcoin is hardly new.",

    "description": "Two successfull hedge fund managers sold Amazon and bought a spot Bitcoin ETF in the third quarter.",
    "fullText": "In the third quarter, hedge fund billionaires Philippe Laffont and Steven Schonfeld sold Amazon stock and added to their positions in the iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\nWall Street expects Amazon’s earnings to grow at 19% annually over the next three years, which makes the current valuation of 34 times earnings look fair.\n\nMore companies and institutional investors are buying Bitcoin (or spot Bitcoin ETFs), and that is likely to continue because it is the more popular and most liquid cryptocurrency.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nIn the third quarter, two hedge fund billionaires sold Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and added to positions in the iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: IBIT), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) managed by BlackRock that tracks the spot price of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC).\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management sold 1.4 million shares of Amazon, trimming the position 14%. He also purchased 76,100 shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust, more than doubling his stake.\n\nSteven Schonfeld of Schonfeld Strategic Advisors sold 253,700 shares of Amazon, reducing the position 72%. He also added 1.1 million shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust, increasing his stake 20%.\n\nThe trades are noteworthy because Laffont and Schonfeld outperformed the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) by 94 percentage points and 22 percentage points, respectively, in the last three years. That makes both hedge fund managers good sources of inspiration.\n\nSeveral Wall Street analysts expect Bitcoin to be far more valuable in the future. Tom Lee at Fundstrat Global Advisors says its price could hit $3 trillion in the long run, which implies more than 3,000% upside from where it currently trades at $95,000. Michael Saylor of Strategy says its price could hit $13 million by 2045, implying more than 13,500% upside.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nAmazon has a strong presence in e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing. Building on that advantage, the company has integrated artificial intelligence (AI) products and features across all three business segments to drive revenue growth and improve profit margins.\n\nIn e-commerce, Amazon has developed hundreds of generative AI applications to improve operational efficiency. They automate customer service, optimize demand forecasting, improve inventory placement, and expedite last-mile delivery. Amazon has also developed an AI model called DeepFleet that helps robots navigate warehouses more quickly.\n\nIn cloud computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has launched new foundational models and services, such as Bedrock for generative AI application development. AWS has also introduced AI agents for coding, security, and incident monitoring, and a business intelligence platform called Quick Suite, which leans on generative AI to analyze data, surface insights, and automate workflows.",

    "fullText": "The price of Bitcoin dropped to $0 on perps decentralized exchange Paradex overnight, according to numerous users, after a database migration issue affected the Paradex blockchain, its block explorer, bridge, and API.\n\nAn issue was first flagged on the Paradex status page at 12:36 a.m, ET on Monday, shortly after social media posts flagged a cascade of liquidations as the price of Bitcoin plunged to $0 on the exchange.\n\nAround 2:00 a.m. ET, the exchange identified the issue and began instituting a fix that resulted in rolling back the state of Paradex Chain, a blockchain built using the Starknet stack. Starknet is an Ethereum layer-2 scaling network.\n\n“We have identified the issue and will be rolling back chain state to block 1604710,” the status update reads. “This is the time before the DB maintenance and is the last known correct state. All accounts will be restored to the state before the DB maintenance. We will provide more updates as we continue with rollback.”\n\nShortly thereafter, Paradex force-cancelled all remaining open orders, and around 5:00 a.m. ET it confirmed that all user funds were safe as its recovery process was ongoing.\n\n“Recovery efforts are ongoing. We can confirm that all user funds are SAFU,” a post on the status page at 5:16 a.m. ET reads.\n\nIt’s still unclear how much the liquidations tallied up to, but data from DeFiLlama indicates that the perps protocol has around $641 million in open interest. The protocol has facilitated around $37 billion in volume over the last 30 days.\n\nAll Paradex services are now operational, according to an update on the status page.\n\nBitcoin Slips On Trade War Fears, Sparks $865M in Liquidations\n\nThe exchange’s price glitch followed a volatile period of trading for BTC, which dropped from more than $95,000 to $92,284 just after 7:00 p.m. on Sunday. The 2% drop in the last 24 hours has eaten into the top crypto asset’s weekly gain, which now stands at 1.4% with BTC recently changing hands at $93,318.\n\nThe slide triggered a growing number of liquidations, which have now extended to more than $875 million over the last 24 hours—$234 million of which can be attributed to Bitcoin, according to data from CoinGlass.",

    "fullText": "Led by Texas and New Hampshire, U.S. states across the national map, both red and blue in political stripes, are developing bitcoin strategic reserves and bringing cryptocurrencies onto their books through additional state finance and budgeting measures.\n\nTexas recently became the first state to purchase bitcoin after a legislative effort that began in 2024, but numerous states have joined the \"Reserve Race\" to pass legislation that will allow them to ultimately buy cryptocurrencies.\n\nNew Hampshire passed its crypto strategic reserve law last May, even before Texas, giving the state treasurer the authority to invest up to 5% of the state funds in crypto ETFs, though precious metals such as gold are also authorized for purchase. Arizona passed similar legislation, while Massachusetts, Ohio, and South Dakota have legislation at various stages of committee review.\n\nDespite much of the legislation being largely sponsored or co-sponsored by Republicans, the adoption of crypto at the state level is not expected to strictly fall along party lines. The 2024 election cycle was the first time that the cryptocurrency industry played a major role in lobbying in both state and national elections. In fact, it was the largest corporate donor in an election cycle, with support given to candidates on both sides. It is already amassing a war chest for the 2026 midterms.\n\nCongress is currently debating a crypto market structure bill, and state-level politicians are as much out to prove that they, and their states, won't be left out of the digital assets boom. Justin Marlowe, a public policy professor at the University of Chicago, sees the state-level trend as largely one of signaling at present. \"If you're a governor and you want to broadcast that you are amenable to innovative business development in the digital economy, these are relatively low-cost, low-risk ways to send that signal. That's why we've seen leaders across the ideological spectrum and all over the country take tangible steps in this direction,\" he said.\n\nWhere the state-level crypto efforts can be described as \"bigger steps\" — Marlowe cited Texas, Arizona, and Florida, as examples — he said it has helped to acknowledge the growing political power of crypto advocates in these states.\n\nSimilarities in the actions taken across states to date include include authorizing the state treasurer or other investment official to allow the investment of a limited amount of public funds in crypto and building out the governance structure needed to invest in crypto. This often will involve more frequent reporting requirements and stronger custodial agreements compared to traditional asset classes. The seeding of the reserve can take the form of utilizing cash or government-seized crypto, as in the recent case of the federal government. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a strategic bitcoin reserve last March, but limited the authorization to seized crypto in an effort to show taxpayers would bear no financial burden.\n\nIt is no surprise that Texas was the first state to fund a crypto reserve. Texas has been a crypto hub for years through its role in bitcoin mining. The state's affordable and flexible power, as well as a political environment that has largely been pro-crypto, led Texas in recent years to a sizable position in not just the national, but global bitcoin hashing market.\n\n\"Texas has spent the last few years becoming one of the key centers of bitcoin activity, especially on the mining side,\" said Christian Catalini, founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab, seeing this move as one that early branded the state as \"open for business\" when it comes to digital assets.\n\n\"Once you've made that bet on infrastructure and industry, adding some Bitcoin exposure at the treasury level is a natural next step,\" Catalini said. Such a move essentially makes the state's balance sheet one that is explicitly aligned with the ecosystem it aims to attract.\n\nTexas also has a long history with bitcoin's traditional market competitor: gold.\n\n\"Texas has proven to be a bedrock of government adoption of bitcoin, starting with laws that allow for legal custody arrangements akin to gold storage laws that are well established there,\" said Nik Bhatia, founder of The Bitcoin Layer.\n\nWhen it comes to storing physical gold, Texas has clear rules on storage and ownership, and even the language invoked – vaults, custodians – helps grease the wheels for crypto assets at the state level. The Texas Bullion Depository of 2015, which allowed for state-level depository of bullion and precious metals, was specifically adapted to apply to digital assets like bitcoin. The Texas Bullion Depositary was the first state-administered precious metals depository in the nation.\n\nTexas has not purchased any on-chain bitcoin. After passing the legislation to create a strategic bitcoin reserve that gave authorization to the state comptroller to hold the cryptocurrency, Texas purchased a stake in a bitcoin ETF — roughly $5 million in the largest bitcoin ETF, the BlackRock iShares' Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which since its launch in January 2024 has grown to over $72 billion in assets under management.\n\nThe Comptroller's office made its purchase on the morning of November 20, 2025, when the price of a single bitcoin was $91,336. As of Saturday morning, bitcoin was trading at a little over $95,000.\n\nBhatia said the approval of bitcoin ETFs by the SEC was crucial to the state plans to be comfortable with the holdings under current U.S. securities law. \"Using ETFs is a very clean and safe way to invest in bitcoin, minimizing storage logistical risk and opting for security law protection,\" Bhatia said.\n\nTexas state officials have described this purchase — which deployed only half of the $10 million set aside by the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve — as a \"placeholder\" while security and storage for raw bitcoin can be put into place.\n\nIn addition to the concept of reserve funds, states are bringing crypto into core finance functions, with an approach that balances the inherent trepidation of venturing into new terrain with a desire to be a part of the fast-moving crypto realm.\n\nNew Hampshire, for example, became the first state to approve the issuance of a bitcoin-backed municipal bond last November, a $100 million issuance that would mark the first time cryptocurrency is used as collateral in the U.S. municipal bond market. The deal has not taken place yet, though plans are for the issuance to occur this year. \"The idea is they'll use bitcoin to back a municipal bond issue, the proceeds of which will then be divvied up into loans to smaller governments for economic development projects across the state,\" Marlowe said. Repayment of these loans will recapitalize the fund.\n\nIt is a creative evolution in state finances, but like many of the mechanisms for crypto development at the state level, it utilizes existing financial structures and state goals, according to Marlowe, with similar public bonds in prior decades used for projects like clean water, school upgrades, and other infrastructure. \"What's different here is it's bitcoin rather than taxpayer dollars as the collateral,\" he said.\n\nIn numerous states, including, Colorada, Utah, and Louisiana, crypto is now accepted as payment for taxes and other state business. As more state public finance crypto efforts develop, the shift represents a change in a core philosophy of safety and liquidity that has dominated the investing of state and local funds for centuries.\n\nIn recent decades, assets including real estate and private equity expanded the investment approach of public funds, but crypto represents not only the most recent addition, but the most volatile.\n\n\"For many in the state/local investing industry, crypto-backed assets are still far too speculative and volatile for public money,\" Marlowe said. \"But others, and I think there's a sort of generational shift in the works, see it as a reasonable store of value that is actually stronger on many other public sector values like transparency and asset integrity,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "Ethereum is battle-tested and has successfully stood through the test of time. After navigating through scaling challenges, the first smart contract platform now anchors decentralized finance (DeFi), securing billions.\n\nAfter years of high fees, Ethereum is turning the corner, taking on competing platforms like Solana, attractive because it is very cheap to transact on the mainnet, and near-zero to move value of implement smart contracts on its layer-2s like Arbitrum or sidechains like Polygon.\n\nIn the third week of January, Ethereum is processing more daily transactions than ever before. What’s more? Gas fees is at its lowest levels on record. Meanwhile, the Ethereum price is firm, holding steady above $3,200.\n\nDISCOVER: Best Meme Coin ICOs to Invest in 2026\n\nThis split between increased network activity and price action defines early 2026 theme: People are using Ethereum more, even when prices wobble. Trackers show that Ethereum averaged close to 2.5M transactions per day over the past week, nearly double the activity seen a year ago. The increase in activity is driven by a combination of technical upgrades and a shift in how users interact with the blockchain.\n\nIn late 2025, Ethereum implemented the Fusaka upgrade, allowing layer-2s like Arbitrum and Base to post data to Ethereum much more cheaply. Additionally, the Ethereum block gas limit was raised from 45M to 60M, allowing the base layer to process more transactions per block without causing congestion. From a technical front, the Peer Data Availability Sampling began rolling out, allowing the network to handle more data efficiently.\n\nThe upcoming Glamsterdam fork will further enhance the network, enabling nodes to process independent transactions simultaneously across multiple CPU cores. This effectively turns a single-lane road into a multi-lane superhighway, drastically increasing throughput without risking “state conflicts.” Ethereum developers also plan to make the network more censorship-resistant by reducing the power of “centralized” relays. After this upgrade, the block limit will also increase from the current 60M to over 100M.\n\nAs the mainnet processes more transactions, fees are drastically falling. While it used to cost $50 to $100 to use the network during busy periods, average mainnet fees have dropped to approximately $0.15–$0.20, even as daily transactions hit an all-time high of over 2.5M. Fees are low partly because most intensive apps, including games, are move to layer-2s like Base.",

    "description": "Bitcoin likely already reached its post-halving peak at $126,000 last year, Jefferies' global head of equity strategy wrote in a note.",
    "fullText": "A longtime crypto bull is ditching bitcoin for gold.\n\nChristopher Wood, the global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, said he just cut bitcoin out of his firm's long-term model portfolio, where the token has accounted for around 5%-10% of the portfolio's allocation for the last five years.\n\nThat's because the price of the crypto has likely peaked, but also because there's an existential threat he sees jeopardizing the bitcoin ecosystem: quantum computing.\n\nIn a recent note to clients, Wood pointed specifically to CRQCs, or cryptographically relevant quantum computers — supercomputers that could potentially \"steal\" bitcoin from circulation, he said.\n\nBitcoin transactions are secured with cryptography, a coding system where transactions are encrypted with public keys, and access to the bitcoin itself is controlled by a private key. It would take supercomputers today \"trillions of years\" to derive a private key from a public one, given how complex the computations are, Wood said. But CRQCs could potentially reduce that time to something like several hours to several days, he speculated.\n\nCRQCs don't yet exist, but chatter about the potential risks is already spreading across the bitcoin community, Wood said, pointing to a report from ChainCode Labs that estimated as much as 10 million tokens, or 50% of all bitcoin in circulation, could be accessed by a CRQC.\n\nSome in the crypto community are arguing that the risk from CRQCs means \"vulnerable coins\" in the bitcoin ecosystem should be burned, Wood bited.\n\n\"While GREED & fear does not believe that the quantum issue is about to hit the Bitcoin price dramatically in the near term, the store of value concept is clearly on less solid foundation from the standpoint of a long-term pension portfolio,\" Wood said of his recent portfolio change. He added that he believed bitcoin reached its peak in the post-halving cycle at $126,000 last year.\n\nWood's team has replaced the allocation to bitcoin in the model portfolio with a 10% allocation to gold and gold mining stocks. The portfolio now has a total 45% allocation to physical gold, a 25% allocation to gold mining stocks, and a 30% allocation to Asian equities, excluding Japan.\n\n\"Meanwhile, the existential issue raised by quantum as regards Bitcoin can only be long-term positive for gold since it remains the historically stress tested store of value. Meanwhile, gold is also the best hedge, if not the only one, on the ever-rising geopolitical risks,\" Wood said.\n\nIt's been a rough few months for bitcoin, with the crypto tumbling into a bear market in late 2025 amid a broader risk-off move that was exacerbated by weak liquidity and concerns about the yen-carry trade.\n\nMeanwhile, the case for owning gold has only grown stronger since its stunning rally in 2025. The metal saw its best performance since 1979 and continues to hover near a record high as investors seek protection from geopolitical conflict and inflationary pressures.",

    "description": "Analysts debate whether Bitcoin will follow gold's scarcity-driven surge or take a more volatile path due to structural market differences.",
    "fullText": "Bitcoin's exchange-traded funds could be following the exact structural playbook that preceded gold's historic 2025 surge, a parallel that suggests a potential parabolic move awaits the top cryptocurrency.\n\nThe analogy was highlighted by Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matthew Hougan on a podcast with influencer Michael 'Threadguy' Jerome.\n\n\"That’s the same thing that’s happening in Bitcoin,\" Hougan said, pointing to the transformation in gold after central banks began \"panic buying\" following the 2022 Ukraine war sanctions.\n\nCentral bank demand for gold jumped from 400 tons to over 1,000 tons annually starting in 2022. That relentless buying absorbed supply for years before igniting a price explosion: gold closed 2022 down, rallied 13% in 2023, 27% in 2024, and then surged nearly 65% in 2025.\n\n“Eventually, what gold tells you is that sellers run out of ammo. And that’s when the price goes parabolic,” the analyst said.\n\nHe sees the same pattern in Bitcoin ETFs, which have consistently bought more than 100% of the new supply since launch. “So I do think gold has shown what’s going to happen... we’re going to get to that parabolic blowoff move if that buy-side demand continues.”\n\nThis “gold-first, Bitcoin-follows” pattern has been observed before, as highlighted in a previous Decrypt report, where Lawrence Lepard, co-founder of Equity Management Associates, noted “Gold often moves first, and then Bitcoin follows and outperforms.\"\n\nFurthermore, following gold's major rallies, \"a swift rebound shouldn't be the base case,\" Ryan McMillin, chief investment officer at Merkle Tree Capital, previously told Decrypt, suggesting any follow-on move may require patience.\n\nBitcoin Google Searches Hit 11-Month Low as Gold Continues to Climb\n\nOther analysts agree with the high-level premise—that sustained buying absorbs selling pressure—but caution that Bitcoin’s path will have its own distinct volatility and drivers.\n\nTim Sun, senior researcher at HashKey Group, partially agreed with McMillin’s views. \"At a high level, the fact that sustained structural buying absorbs market selling pressure is indeed a core characteristic of any supply-scarce asset entering a long-term bull market,\" he told Decrypt.\n\nHowever, Sun highlighted critical distinctions in market structure.\n\nGold, Silver Hit New Highs as Bitcoin Trades Flat Ahead of Key Macroeconomic Events\n\nFor gold, buyers are typically central banks and sovereign wealth funds seeking a \"hedge against fiat currency credibility,\" resulting in low-leverage, long-term capital. Bitcoin ETF buyers, while institutional, still treat it as a risk asset, leading to \"far higher\" embedded leverage and trading activity.",

    "description": "Ethereum treasury Bitmine Immersion is making a big investment in MrBeast's company, which said last year it would launch a financial services platform.",
    "fullText": "The biggest ethereum holding company in the world is betting big on the digital finance ambitions of one of the world's top online content creators.\n\nTom Lee, the cofounder of global investment advisory firm Fundstrat Global Advisors, announced on Thursday that Bitmine Immersion Technologies is investing $200 million in Beast Industries, the holding company founded by YouTube star MrBeast.\n\nJimmy Donaldson, better known by his social media moniker, announced plans to launch a financial services platform in December, and Lee said on Thursday that he believes it will play a pivotal role in one of the financial sector's fastest-growing markets.\n\nBeast Industries CEO Jeff Housenbold also hinted at a future partnership, saying in a statement: \"We look forward to exploring ways to further collaborate and incorporate DeFi into our upcoming financial services platform.\"\n\nIn June 2025, Lee led Bitmine's strategic pivot from operating as a bitcoin miner to becoming the world's largest ethereum treasury, helping usher in last year's investor craze for digital asset holding strategies.\n\n\"MrBeast and Beast Industries, in our view, is the leading content creator of our generation, with a reach and engagement unmatched with Gen Z, Gen Alpha and Millennials,\" he said. \"Beast Industries is the largest and most innovative creator based platform in the world and our corporate and personal values are strongly aligned.\"\n\nLee said on CNBC that he sees his bet on Beast Industries as a rising player in a broader movement to tokenize assets on the blockchain.\n\n\"Digitalization of not only dollars, but stocks and equities, is going to take place and over time, that really blurs what is a service versus what's digital money,\" he added. \"That's where a collaboration and investment into Beast Industries makes sense.\"\n\nCompanies such as Robinhood have recently embraced asset tokenization, viewing it as a way to offer investors exposure to companies that might still be private or to allow investors to more easily trade hard assets like real estate.\n\nBeast Industries, for its part, has been laying the groundwork for a financial services venture for a while. In a pitch deck shared in early 2025, which was viewed by Business Insider, it described customized offerings that would target MrBeast's audience, supported by financial literacy content. The deck listed nine potential offerings, including student loans, insurance, and credit insights. It said the company would launch by partnering with a fintech company to leverage its existing infrastructure \"while avoiding regulatory, credit risk, and capital requirement.\"\n\nDonaldson has also said he's looking to build a financial literacy-focused channel.\n\nBeast Industries took in over $400 million in revenue in 2024, according to investor materials viewed by Business Insider. The company lost money last year, mainly because of high costs in its media business. Recently, the company has been on a cost-cutting push as it looks to reduce media-related losses.\n\nIn 2025, the social media star sought to raise $200 million to extend a $300 million Series C round he'd raised in 2024 at a $5 billion valuation, according to investment materials viewed by Business Insider.\n\nDonaldson's company has been pitching investors on the idea of building the \"next Disney.\" Like Disney, Beast Industries is looking to expand well beyond video into different product categories.",

    "title": "Eric Adams' crypto-token that soared and then plunged in value connected to a controversial Brooklyn landlord",
    "description": "A crypto token promoted by Eric Adams is linked to Sefi Zvieli, a landlord whose Brooklyn property became a city-backed homeless shelter.",
    "fullText": "A cryptocurrency promoted this week by former New York City mayor Eric Adams spiked in value before rapidly losing most of its gains, and is connected to a landlord who previously secured a lucrative city-backed homeless shelter deal after hiring a lawyer with close ties to Adams.\n\nAdams told journalists Monday morning that the \"NYC Token\" project would generate money to fund blockchain education for underserved New Yorkers and fight antisemitism and \"anti-Americanism.\"\n\nHe didn't say how, or specify who he was working with, but said he wasn't drawing a salary yet.\n\nThe project's website mentions an entity called C18 Digital LLC in its terms of service. An entity with that name was formed in Delaware on December 30. The certificate of formation was signed by Sefi Zvieli.\n\nThe City, a nonprofit news outlet, reported in 2023 that Zvieli avoided foreclosure on a \"filthy, fetid, and dangerous\" block of student housing he owned in Brooklyn by inking a deal to rent it to a New York City-financed nonprofit as a homeless shelter for $3.5 million a year.\n\nThe story said he snagged the deal after hiring Frank Carone, a lawyer with close ties to Adams, after Adams had won the New York City mayoral election but before he was sworn in as mayor. Zvieli has also been listed in public records for various New York companies and has been described by Israeli news outlets as a hotel investor.\n\nIt's unclear what role Zvieli played in NYC Token beyond signing the formation papers. He didn't reply to an email address listed for him in website registration records. Carone didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe token's trading history showed what happened in the hours after Adams plugged it: After peaking around 50 cents per token, its price fell to less than 9 cents per token. It has since risen to around 13 cents per token.\n\nSocial media users who said they had purchased the coin expressed outrage, accusing Adams or people affiliated with the project of stealing funds. The crypto analytics company Bubblemaps said in posts on X that a wallet withdrew $2.5 million of sales proceeds from a liquidity pool associated with NYC Token shortly before its value collapsed, before putting about $1.5 million back.\n\nElissa Buchter, a spokesperson for NYC Token, said in an email that the token's backers were not responsible for its wild performance.\n\n\"Our market maker made adjustments in an attempt to keep trading running smoothly, and as part of this process, moved liquidity,\" she said in an email. \"The team has not sold any tokens and is subject to lockups and transfer restrictions. THE TEAM HAS NOT WITHDRAWN ANY MONEY FROM THE ACCOUNT.\"\n\nA spokesman for Adams shared a statement in which Adams denied profiting from the token's launch, said he didn't personally invest in the token, and said \"no money was taken out of NYC Token.\"\n\n\"The NYC Token was designed as a free, voluntary way to support educational and nonprofit efforts,\" said the spokesman, Todd Shapiro. \"Claims suggesting otherwise are inaccurate.\"\n\nAs mayor, Adams was friendly with some figures in the cryptocurrency industry and converted some of his paychecks to bitcoin. In interviews on Monday, he twice referred to blockchains, the technology that acts as a ledger for many digital asset transactions, as \"blockchange.\"\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the NYC Token, it's so far faring better than \"NYCCoin,\" a token that Adams boosted early in his mayoralty. Trading on that dried up, and it was reportedly disavowed by the city and delisted by its main exchange in 2023.",

    "description": "A NYC themed meme coin crashed shortly after launch this week, drawing swift outcry from the crypto community online.",
    "fullText": "Former New York City Mayor Eric Adams was a bullish proponent of crypto during his time in office, but an ill-fated meme coin debut this week has drawn outcry.\n\nOn January 12, Adams shared a post on his X account announcing the launch of NYC Token, a New York-themed token with no official ties to the city, but which creators said on the token's website would go toward \"critical initiatives.\" Adams said some proceeds would go toward fighting antisemitism and blockchain education for kids.\n\nAs it started trading, the coin quickly surged to a market cap of roughly $580 million before suddenly reversing course and plunging more than 80% in a few minutes.\n\nOutrage from the crypto community has been swift this week.\n\nThe episode drew accusations that investors had been victims of a \"rug pull,\" in which a token's major holders sell after an initial surge, leaving investors locked into their positions and unable to exit without losing money.\n\nWhile NYC Token rose slightly on its second day of trading, accusations that either Adams or the token's creators had \"rugged\" investors continued to swirl. Legal filings show that the company behind NYC Token, c18 digital LLC, was formed in Delaware two weeks ago.\n\nAn anonymous crypto influencer on X shared several posts saying liquidity had been pulled before NYC Token's plunge, with screenshots to illustrate, and users posted that they believed Adams had profited from the scheme.\n\n\"This has to be the fastest rug pull I've ever seen,\" said one user on X\n\nFor others, the sense of schadenfreude was strong as they watched meme coin investors caught in another high-profile collapse. The episode drew comparisons to Hawk Tuah coin, promoted by viral influencer Haliey Welch. The coin surged before losing 95% of its value shortly after its debut.\n\nA rug pull is usually defined as making a token effectively useless, which in memecoin land often means removing the liquidity needed for holders to sell,\" Haonan Li, founder of stablecoin merchant platform Codex, told Business Insider. That's what appears to have happened in Adam's case—the base layer of liquidity was pulled from the market.\"\n\nAdams could not be reached for comment. Representatives for the token's creators did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nCrypto data platform CoinGecko was still flagging the NYC Token as high risk on Wednesday. It posted the following disclaimer on the token's page:\n\n\"According to Rugcheck.xyz, there is a risk of market manipulation due to large concentration of tokens held in one or more unidentified wallets. Please use caution.\"",

    "description": "Sorry: The roboadvisor is not tripling your investment.",
    "fullText": "Customers of automated investment platform Betterment are being targeted with a cryptocurrency rewards scam following a data breach that allowed threat actors to obtain some user data and send fake emails promising huge returns on Bitcoin and Ethereum deposits.\n\nAccording to a Jan. 12 security update posted on Betterment's website (and sent to users via email), hackers gained unauthorized access on Jan. 9 to a third-party platform used for marketing and operations. Following the breach, they sent fraudulent messages to some customers with offers to triple crypto investments.\n\nThe scam emails were sent to Betterment users on Jan. 9, soon after the data breach, with subject lines like \"We'll triple your crypto!\" The message inside claimed that Betterment was \"giving back\" for a limited time and tripling Bitcoin and Ethereum deposits as large as $750,000 to specified wallets. Threat actors tried to create a sense of urgency with an expiration deadline for the promotion (a typical scam tactic).\n\nThe messages came from [email protected], which is a legitimate Betterment subdomain, allowing them to appear verified in users' inboxes. Note that this is the same email address Betterment used to send the security update to all of its customers.\n\nA nearly identical crypto scheme targeted Grubhub users in December with emails—also sent from a real Grubhub subdomain—promoting a 10x return on $1,000 in deposited bitcoin.\n\nCybercriminals were able to steal some customer information from the compromised system, including names, email addresses, mailing addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth. Betterment has said that no passwords or credentials were included in the breach, nor did threat actors gain access to user accounts. While few official details have been published, the company is reportedly being extorted as the target of the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.\n\nIf you're a Betterment customer, be wary of any unsolicited communication in the coming days and weeks about your account. Scammers will use events like this as a phishing opportunity. Know that Betterment (and other legitimate companies) will not request your password or other personal information via email, text, or phone call. If you are concerned about your account or want to update your credentials or other data, go directly to the website or app and do so there—this is generally safer than clicking links in communication, even if messages from Betterment are (or seem) legitimate.",

    "description": "A Satoshi-era Bitcoin miner reactivated long-dormant wallets to move 2,000 BTC, worth about $181 million, to Coinbase.",
    "fullText": "A Bitcoin miner from the network’s earliest days has emerged from dormancy to shift 2,000 BTC, a strategic profit-taking move valued at approximately $181 million.\n\nCryptoQuant's Julio Moreno noted that this represents the most significant activity by a \"Satoshi-era\" whale since late 2024.\n\nMoreno highlighted the timing of the transaction and observed that \"Satoshi-era miners [tend to] move their Bitcoin at key inflection points.\"\n\nAdding technical context, Sani, the founder of TimechainIndex, confirmed that the funds originated from block rewards mined in 2010. Notably, the blockchain network had rewarded early miners of that era with 50 BTC in block subsidies.\n\nThe coins had remained untouched for more than 15 years across 40 legacy Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK) addresses. They were later consolidated and transferred to Coinbase.\n\nTypically, market analysts interpret transfers to centralized exchanges as a prelude to an open-market sale.\n\nMeanwhile, this transaction is not an isolated anomaly but underscores a developing trend of \"vintage\" supply hitting the market.\n\nOver the past year, wallets from the 2009–2011 era have been increasingly reactivated across the Bitcoin network. The activity reflects early holders moving to lock-in gains or update long-standing custody arrangements.\n\nFor context, Galaxy Digital had executed one of the largest crypto sales in history by helping a Satoshi-era investor to sell more than $9 billion in July 2025.\n\nCrucially, the market has demonstrated remarkable resilience amid this selling pressure. Bitcoin successfully absorbed these large-scale \"OG\" supply shocks without suffering a breakdown in market structure.\n\nThis signals that while Bitcoin's early adopters are moving to lock in generational wealth, the market's liquidity remains deep enough to handle their exits.\n\nHowever, despite the immediate sell-side pressure from legacy holders, long-term institutional forecasts remain bullish.\n\nIn a report released last week, asset manager VanEck projected that Bitcoin could reach a theoretical valuation of $2.9 million per coin by 2050. The firm’s thesis relies on the asset’s potential adoption as a global settlement currency.\n\nRead original story Satoshi-Era Miner Moves Millions in Bitcoin After 15 Years of Silence by Oluwapelumi Adejumo at beincrypto.com",

    "description": "I asked ChatGPT to break it down for me, given the state of crypto. It made clear that its answer is \"a structured way to think about the opportunity and risk.\"",
    "fullText": "Cryptocurrency is either touted as the next big thing to make you rich or the riskiest investment ever. Yet despite its volatility and constant controversy, many investors continue to find ways to profit in the crypto space.\n\nIf someone realistically wanted to get rich via cryptocurrency in 2026, which one is most likely to make that possible, and how? I asked ChatGPT to break it down for me, given the current state of crypto. It made clear that its answer does not constitute financial advice, but rather “a structured way to think about the opportunity and risk.”\n\nChatGPT took a realistic look at what “getting rich” actually means in the crypto space. It was clear that it doesn’t mean “guaranteed 100% returns by New Year,” as the crypto market is extremely volatile, risky and speculative.\n\nRealistic goals might look like a 5% to 10% return on your core position — the main portion of your crypto portfolio held in more established assets like bitcoin or ethereum that you plan to keep long term. You might also see a larger potential return on a smaller “moonshot” allocation — a high-risk, high-reward investment in a newer or less proven coin that could spike in value but could just as easily wipe out, too.\n\nAnalysts place wide predictions even on the giants. For example, bitcoin (BTC) is forecasted to be valued between $100,000 and $200,000 in 2026.\n\nFind Out: 13 Cheap Cryptocurrencies With the Highest Potential Upside for You\n\nRead Next: 9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\n\nBased on current expert commentary and fundamentals, ChatGPT said there are two categories of coins with the best shot at making you rich across two strategies.\n\nUnsurprisingly, bitcoin (BTC), the most well-known coin, remains the leading choice. Many forecasts assume it will stay dominant. However, ethereum (ETH), the runner-up, is seen as more utility-based, and some analysts believe it may outperform BTC in certain phases.\n\nIn either case, these coins are less about “getting rich quick” and more about a reasonable chance of strong returns at moderate risk, the AI said.\n\nSome investors are turning to altcoins — smaller cryptocurrencies outside of bitcoin and ethereum — that could see bigger short-term gains. Coins like XRP and Solana are getting attention for their performance potential, though they come with higher risk, ChatGPT noted. Even newer projects, especially those combining AI and blockchain, promise sky-high returns, but most are highly speculative. Forecasts of 500% profits make headlines, but in reality, very few ever deliver.",

    "description": "If true, the claim could significantly reshape the global bitcoin market.",
    "fullText": "When Bitcoin first launched in 2009, many investors dismissed the currency as a fringe concept and even as a scam. (Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett’s former right-hand man at Berkshire Hathaway, memorably called it “stupid and evil.”) But the asset has skyrocketed in value in recent years and President Donald Trump labeled the currency “digital gold” after signing an executive order to create a strategic bitcoin reserve last January. Now, reports allege that Venezuela has bought into that “digital gold,” holding a “shadow reserve” nearly double that of the U.S.\n\nDigital publication Project Brazen reported Saturday that Venezuela could hold an estimated $60 billion worth of Bitcoin. Additional intelligence reports allege that ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his associates accrued Bitcoin via three channels: a gold swap overseen by Venezuelan Interior Minister Alex Saab in 2018, oil revenue priced in Bitcoin, and by seizing crypto mining equipment from miners in the country.\n\nSanctions have walled off the country’s access to financial markets for years, and experts allege that they may have motivated Venezuelan leaders to invest in cryptocurrencies to sidestep the barrier.\n\nBitcointreasuries.net puts Venezuela’s holdings at 240 bitcoin, worth nearly $22 million. The website sourced the data from a 2022 Forbes article that cited research from a blockchain analytics firm. The total is a far cry from the estimated U.S. holdings of 328,372, currently worth $30 billion, though the claim positions Venezuela’s holdings at nearly double the U.S. and one of the biggest holders of bitcoin globally.\n\nThe claims of Venezuela’s shadow Bitcoin holdings have predictably garnered skeptics, including digital asset financial services company Ledn Co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo, who grew up in Venezuela and whose family has mined crypto there since 2014.\n\nDi Bartolomeo finds no credibility in any of the three alleged sources of bitcoin income: the gold swap, oil exchange or mining equipment seizures. “This to me does not align with anything in the public record,” di Bartolomeo told Fortune. “There’s so much corruption, embezzlement and missing money that I don’t believe that any meaningful amount would have accrued.”\n\nHe outlined his full argument in a Coindesk op-ed piece titled “Don’t hold your breath for Venezuela’s bitcoin.” Though he notes that his family’s crypto mining materials were seized by the government in 2018 and returned five years later in a worn down condition, signaling heavy use of the equipment.",

    "description": "MSCI said it wouldn't boot Strategy and other crypto treasury firms from its indexes, but signaled a wider review of such companies was coming.",
    "fullText": "The crypto market was spared a blow this week after indexing giant MSCI opted not to delist crypto holding companies from its indexes.\n\nMSCI decided not to proceed with a proposal to exclude digital asset treasuries from its indexes, though it said it would conduct a wider review of how some companies are treated.\n\nThe move spares companies like Strategy and other firms whose main business is buying and holding crypto from a potentially devastating blow. If MSCI dumped those stocks, many investors who track its indexes would have likely followed suit. However, it leaves the door open to a crackdown in the future.\n\nStrategy stock spiked as much as 5% on the news.\n\nWhen the MSCI first said it was considering excluding firms with 50% or more assets in crypto, the idea sparked strong backlash from the industry. MSCI's argument was that crypto treasuries are more like investment funds than operating companies, and should be treated differently for the purposes of inclusion in some of its world indexes.\n\nFrank Chaparro, head of content at crypto market maker GSR, said that the updates is a subtle but important developement for the crypto market, which is still fragile following the market meltdown sent prices plummeting in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"As leverage unwound and sentiment around these structures deteriorated, weakness in DAT equities spilled over into broader crypto risk appetite,\" he told Business Insider. \"Against that backdrop, any credible bullish catalyst for the space, particularly one tied to index inclusion and institutional access, carries outsized signaling value right now.\"\n\nChaparro added that while many exchange platforms offer investors the opportunity to purchase crypto, the majority of traders still opt to gain exposure through funds and other index-linked products.\n\nThat said, MSCI signaled that it plans to embark on a broader consultation over how \"non-operating companies\" should be treated. Another bout of uncertainty related to indexing could create fresh headwinds for Strategy and other companies that hoard crypto on their balance sheets.\n\nChaparro said that he thinks this strong scrutiny on the part of the index is justified, highlighting the importance of holding DATs to high standards\n\n\"Companies that function more like investment funds than operating businesses with bitcoin as a core treasury asset should be evaluated differently and potentially excluded,\" he said. \"Clear and consistent criteria will be essential to preserve index integrity as these structures proliferate.\"",

    "fullText": "Ethereum’s staking queues have emptied out and the network can now absorb new validators and exits almost in real time.\n\nThis means the rush to lock up ETH has faded for now and staking is settling into a steady-state instead of a scarcity trade.\n\nQueues are simply the time spent to start or stop staking on the Ethereum network, acting as a sentiment gauge and a liquidity gauge.\n\nIn one sense, the lack of queues is a feature, not a bug, as these are proof Ethereum can handle staking flows without locking up liquidity for weeks.\n\nAt the same time, staking rewards have compressed toward 3% as total staked ETH grew faster than issuance and fee income, limiting incentives for renewed surges in either direction and leaving queues near zero even as overall staking participation remains elevated.\n\nLower yield can reflect crowding, but also a higher ‘trust premium’ — more ETH is choosing to sit in staking rather than on exchange order books.\n\nWhat this means in plain terms is that “staking pressure” is no longer a daily narrative.\n\nWhen queues are long, ETH supply is effectively being locked faster than the network can onboard validators, and that can create a sense of scarcity.\n\nWhen queues sit near zero, the system is closer to neutral. People can stake or unstake without waiting weeks, which makes staking feel less like a one-way door and more like a liquid allocation.\n\nThis changes the psychology around the ether trade.\n\nStaking still reduces immediate sell pressure, but it is not the same as coins being stuck. With withdrawals functioning smoothly, ETH behaves less like a forced lockup asset and more like a yield-bearing position that can be resized when sentiment shifts.\n\nOverall, Ethereum's staking supply is at around 30%, well below the 50% that Galaxy Digital predicted at the end of 2025. Expectations Galaxy had that ETH would sustain prices above $5,500 thanks to staking-induced supply shock, and that layer-2s would overtake layer-1s in economic activity, failed to materialize.\n\nEthereum’s DeFi TVL sits around $74 billion, well below its roughly $106 billion peak in 2021, even as daily active addresses have nearly doubled over the same period, according to DeFi Llama.\n\nThe network still accounts for close to 58% of total DeFi TVL, but that share masks a more fragmented reality.\n\nIncremental growth is increasingly being captured by ecosystems such as Solana, Base, and bitcoin-native DeFi, allowing activity to expand across the Ethereum orbit without translating into the same concentration of value or demand for ETH itself.",

    "fullText": "A new geopolitical conflict is unfolding. Yet, US stocks are… up at new record highs?\n\nThat's the dynamic on display on Monday as investors digest the US's raid on Venezuela and the capture of the nation's president, Nicolás Maduro, over the weekend.\n\nDespite the upheaval of its South American neighbor, US stocks, gold, and bitcoin were among risk assets that churned higher on Monday. As far as markets are concerned, the Venezuela situation seems to already be an afterthought.\n\nThe S&P 500 climbed 0.6%, while the Dow's 1.3% jump notched a record closing high for the benchmark. Energy stocks led the way across both indexes.\n\nThose moves seem counterintuitive, but they reflect a dynamic that markets have shown time and time again over the decades: investors simply don't care that much about conflict abroad.\n\nStocks, for one, have a pattern of falling as geopolitical tensions rise, but rebounding once the conflict actually occurs. According to an analysis by Fundstrat Research, there are at least five instances where equities rallied after a major geopolitical event, such as the first Gulf War or when Hamas attacked Israel in 2023.\n\n\"The old adage has long been to 'sell the rumor, buy the invasion,'\" Kent Fung, Fundstrat's vice president of market intelligence, wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\n\nPeter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research, said Monday's rally showed investors are more focused on taking the weekend's string of events in a \"positive light.\"\n\n\"You had a country that has been hostile to the US that has expropriated a lot of US investments, and now Trump has orchestrated a regime shift that could open the country up for new investment,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nThe lack of a negative reaction in markets could also reflect how investors can't yet price in a final outcome of the US-Venezuela conflict. The market also seems to be focused on other recent stock drivers, such as the rally broadening out to sectors beyond tech, Berezin said.\n\nThe market's upward momentum is proving to be a tough force to stop. US equities notched another record-setting year in 2025, with the S&P 500 gaining 16% as investors remained laser-focused on the growth potential of AI, strong earnings, rate cuts, and a still-resilient US economy.\n\n\"Solid results almost across the board\" last year have caused investor confidence to be \"reasonably strong,\" Nicholas Colas, the co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a note on Monday.\n\n\"From a mechanical standpoint, the global macro backdrop looks essentially unchanged,\" Karl Schamotta, the chief market strategist at Corpay, wrote in a note detailing how investors largely took the Venezuela situation \"in stride.\"\n\nIf anything, investors are more likely to care about the coming December jobs report, Schamotta added, which could influence the market's expectations for interest rate cuts in 2026.",

    "fullText": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin declared that the network has finally cracked blockchain’s fundamental trilemma through the combination of zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines and PeerDAS technology now running on mainnet.\n\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a decade-long technical journey that began with Buterin’s first data availability sampling commit in 2015 and early ZKEVM development around 2020.\n\n“These are not minor improvements; they are shifting Ethereum into being a fundamentally new and more powerful kind of decentralized network,” Buterin wrote in a post on X, describing how the protocol now delivers decentralization, consensus, and high bandwidth simultaneously, a feat previously considered impossible.\n\nButerin explained that early peer-to-peer networks faced stark limitations, with BitTorrent offering massive bandwidth and decentralization but no consensus mechanism.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin achieved decentralization and consensus at the cost of extremely low throughput due to replicated rather than distributed work.\n\nEthereum’s new architecture breaks this pattern by splitting computational work across nodes while maintaining cryptographic verification of all state transitions.\n\nZKEVMs have achieved production-quality performance, with proving times dropping from 16 minutes to 16 seconds and costs falling 45-fold, with 99% of Ethereum blocks now provable in under 10 seconds on target hardware.\n\nMeanwhile, PeerDAS enables nodes to verify data availability by sampling small portions rather than downloading entire blocks, dramatically expanding throughput without sacrificing decentralization.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation set a security-first roadmap requiring teams to achieve 128-bit provable security by the end of 2026, with intermediate milestones at 100-bit security by May 2026 and mandatory integration with the soundcalc security estimation tool by February.\n\n“If an attacker can forge a proof, they can forge anything: mint tokens from nothing, rewrite state, steal funds,” the foundation warned in December, emphasizing that performance gains cannot compromise cryptographic integrity.\n\nGeorge Kadianakis from the foundation’s cryptography team stressed the importance of securing architectures before they become moving targets.\n\n“Once teams have hit these targets and zkVM architectures stabilize, the formal verification work we’ve been investing in can reach its full potential,” he wrote, noting that recent advances in compact polynomial commitment schemes like WHIR and techniques such as JaggedPCS now make ambitious security targets achievable.",

    "fullText": "Just as we talked about why crypto could pump big this 2026 yesterday, Bitcoin price pushed up toward $90,000, while alts like Ethereum and XRP outperformed as BTC dominance slips under 60%. This somehow caught us off guard, especially after weeks of bearish sentiment heading into January.\n\nRefusing a breakdown, the market is running higher. Bitcoin jumped with 1% price gain, Ethereum with around 3%, and altcoins followed. XRP rallied close to 6%, easily beating major alts’ daily gains, and sentiment flipped a little after yesterday’s options expiry cleared the board.\n\nAt around 59%, Bitcoin dominance shows a start of a heavy rotation, just like popping popcorn. Capital is moving, Bitcoin price remains elevated, blasting $90,000, as we track a CME gap above the resistance level, which has a strong historical tendency to get filled.\n\n(source – BTC USD, CME gap, TradingView)\n\nDespite dominance slipping, Bitcoin stays resilient. On a weekly basis, it climbed by 2.5%, while the winner of last year, gold, slid more than 4% after peaking near $4,550. That divergence is the perfect example of rotation narrative as some capital is shifting from traditional hedges toward digital assets.\n\nLiquidity conditions also helped. The Federal Reserve injected nearly $19.5 billion through repo operations, one of the largest such moves since the Covid era. These injections might not grab headlines, but they support risk assets in the background, as can be seen in Bitcoin price action.\n\nDISCOVER: 10+ Next Crypto to 100X In\n\nA single whale (whom the community called an insider whale with a good hit rate) opened long positions worth more than $600 million in ETH, far outweighing exposure to Bitcoin price and Solana combined. The scale alone raised eyebrows, but the timing was perfect, as usual. With over 203,000 ETH in play, the bet implies expectations of further upside.\n\nThe Ethereum price held above $3,100, supported by good volume and volatility. ETH is leading this transition phase and benefited first from the market as Bitcoin dominance drifts lower. XRP followed with solid gains, and the altcoins’ market showed signs of life yet again.\n\nAway from the price action, what is happening in the macro structure is also worth watching. British stocks outperformed US markets since Donald Trump returned to office, challenging assumptions that American equities would immediately bump. UK indices have shown steadier strength, while US stocks have lagged despite policy optimism, as reported by BBC. Is Trump really the president we need in crypto?",

    "fullText": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said new privacy and data-handling technologies have effectively solved the blockchain’s long-standing scalability challenges.\n\nHowever, he cautioned that a full security rollout of these developments remains a few years away.\n\nIn a January 3 post on X, Buterin said Ethereum’s integration of zero-knowledge virtual machines has changed the network’s capabilities.\n\nHe added that the shift is driven by the pairing of ZK-EVMs with the data distribution method, PeerDAS.\n\n\"These are not minor improvements; they are shifting Ethereum into being a fundamentally new and more powerful kind of decentralized network,\" he stated.\n\nHe claimed this combination resolves the \"Blockchain Trilemma\"—the historic engineering difficulty of achieving decentralization, security, and high bandwidth simultaneously.\n\nButerin compared the upgraded architecture to a \"BitTorrent with consensus,\" contrasting it with Bitcoin’s model, which prioritizes decentralization but struggles with data throughput.\n\nWith the new upgrades, he noted, Ethereum can now handle data loads comparable to massive file-sharing networks while maintaining the security of a decentralized ledger.\n\n\"The trilemma has been solved - not on paper, but with live running code, of which one half (data availability sampling) is on mainnet today, and the other half (ZK-EVMs) is production-quality on performance today - safety is what remains,\" he argued.\n\nHowever, the roadmap for implementing this vision extends well into the future.\n\nWhile Buterin asserted that the technology has reached \"production-quality performance,\" he conceded that significant work remains to ensure the system's safety.\n\nAccording to his timeline, ZK-EVMs will not become the primary method for validating blocks until between 2027 and 2030. These systems will enable faster and cheaper transaction verification without exposing underlying data.\n\nIn the interim, the network plans to implement incremental upgrades.\n\nThis year, Buterin expects the gas limit to increase. New protocol developments would enable this by separating transaction proposers from block builders and expanding the amount of work each block can handle.\n\nLooking further ahead, Buterin outlined a goal for \"distributed block building.\" This is a system in which no single entity constructs a complete set of transactions.\n\nHe said distributing this authority reduces the risk of centralized censorship and ensures transactions are processed more evenly across regions.\n\n\"A long-term ideal holy grail is to get to a future where the full block is never constituted in one single place. This will not be necessary for a long time, but IMO it is worth striving for us at least have the capability to do that,\" Buterin wrote.\n\nThe technical pivot comes as Ethereum continues to face stiff competition from faster, lower-cost blockchains, pressuring developers to accelerate the deployment of these next-generation scaling solutions.\n\nRead original story Vitalik Buterin Claims Ethereum has Solved the Blockchain Trilemma Problem by Oluwapelumi Adejumo at beincrypto.com",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin ATM fraud reached new highs in 2025, with scammers reportedly stealing $333 million from victims, the FBI said.\n\nIn most cases of bitcoin ATM fraud, scammers impersonate either a company or a bank and flag supposed suspicious activity on the victim's account, advising them to deposit money into a bitcoin ATM to protect their funds or remedy the issue. That money then goes directly into the scammers' account.\n\nBitcoin ATMs have increased in popularity in the US, with over 30,000 machines in the States in 2024 — which is about 81.27% of the bitcoin ATMs in the world, according to finance news site Finance Magnates.\n\nThe FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) reported that more than 10,000 people were victims of bitcoin ATM-related fraud in 2025 alone.\n\n\"Based on IC3 reporting, data shows from January to November of 2025 there are over 12,000 complaints and over $333.5 million in monetary losses, an increase compared to the same time span last year,\" the FBI said in a statement emailed to Business Insider.\n\nIn 2024, the FTC reported that cryptocurrency scams in particular can be more financially devastating than other types of fraud. The report said that, midway through 2024, the median loss reported by individuals related to cryptocurrency fraud was $5,400. The median individual loss tied to reports of general fraud was $447.\n\nAnd the amount of money lost has been steadily increasing each year.\n\nData from the FTC shows that bitcoin ATMs accounted for $114 million in reported losses in 2023 and $78 million in losses in 2022, meaning reported losses due to bitcoin ATM fraud more than doubled in just two years.\n\nThe FTC urges people to pay close attention to any red flags when contacted by a bank or company by double-checking phone numbers and reaching out directly to companies that initiate contact with you. The agency also suggests slowing down and not feeling rushed because scammers often want a quick transaction.\n\nBitcoin has been used in other forms of fraud. The FTC advises that legitimate businesses and government agencies will not request bitcoin as a form of payment.\n\nWhile fraud does not only plague certain generations, older victims have been more susceptible to cryptocurrency crimes, the data shows.\n\nVictims 60 and over accounted for 71% of the reported losses using bitcoin ATMs during the first half of 2024, losing $46 million, according to the FTC.",

    "fullText": "Tax authorities are closing in on crypto tax evasion, and the net is widening beyond national borders. Beginning Jan. 1 in the U.K. and more than 40 other countries, exchanges must start collecting and reporting detailed trading records for local customers. This data can expose undeclared gains and, in some cases, help investigators trace suspicious flows. The change matters for the payments and FinTech ecosystem that connects bank accounts and cards to crypto platforms.\n\nIn a Jan. 1 report, the Financial Times said major cryptocurrency exchanges will be required to collect full transaction records for U.K. customers, including purchase price, sale price and profits, and to gather and report users’ tax residency information to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). The U.K. is part of an initial group of 48 jurisdictions implementing the OECD’s Cryptoasset Reporting Framework, or CARF, which sets a common format for reporting and sharing crypto trading data.\n\n“This is the beginning of the end for crypto investors who thought they could invest and gain from crypto in secrecy,” said Andrew Park, a tax investigations partner at Price Bailey.\n\nThe FT said that from 2027 HMRC will begin automatically sharing the information it receives with other participating tax authorities, including all EU countries, as well as jurisdictions such as the Channel Islands, Brazil, the Cayman Islands and South Africa. Overall, 75 countries have committed to implement CARF, with major crypto hubs including the UAE, Hong Kong, Singapore and Switzerland slated to join in 2027 and start exchanging data in 2028; the U.S. is expected to implement in 2028, with exchanges beginning in 2029.\n\nFor U.K. taxpayers, the FT noted that crypto taxes generally fall under capital gains rules, with profits above a £3,000 annual allowance taxable, although heavy buying and selling can be treated as trading and taxed as income with national insurance. HMRC has also opened a voluntary disclosure facility for undeclared gains made before April 2024 and trebled “nudge” letters to 65,000 suspected non-compliers in the 2024–25 tax year.\n\nPYMNTS’ recent reporting has tracked the fraud backdrop that regulators cite when they push for more transparency. PYMNTS covered the Justice Department’s new crypto scam “strike force,” aimed at organized networks tied to China. PYMNTS also reported on a Senate bill that would create a federal task force to combat cryptocurrency scams, and on an SEC case alleging a $14 million scheme that targeted retail investors. In separate coverage, PYMNTS noted that bitcoin ATMs and kiosks are increasingly used to route scam victims’ cash into digital wallets, making losses difficult to recover once funds are sent.\n\n: Scroll to Continue",

    "description": "A 2024 paper calculates $6.77B buys majority hash power. Bitcoin derivatives create profit incentives for block-reverting attacks.",
    "fullText": "Bitcoin’s security model rests on one assumption: attacking the network costs more than any attacker could gain. A 2024 paper by Farokhnia and Goharshady does the math on this assumption and finds it wanting.\n\nFor roughly $6.77 billion in hardware, an attacker could control over 50% of Bitcoin’s hash rate. With 30% of hash power, success probability exceeds 95% within 34 days at a cost of about $2.9 billion.\n\nThese are large absolute numbers, but relatively small: Bitcoin’s $1.78 trillion market cap and the monthly derivatives volume that now regularly exceeds $2 trillion on unregulated exchanges alone. The attack pays for itself if you short Bitcoin before crashing its price.\n\nThe paper challenges three assumptions the crypto community has treated as fact. (1) That you need 51% of hash power to attack successfully. Not true. With 30%, you have high probability of reverting six blocks, enough to shatter the six-confirmation finality standard most practitioners rely on. (2) Acquiring majority hash power is prohibitively expensive. It is expensive but represents less than 0.5% of Bitcoin’s market cap. (3) miners have no incentive to attack since they depend on BTC-denominated rewards. This ignores derivatives entirely.\n\nIn simple terms an attack would work like this: An attacker acquires put options or other shorting instruments on Bitcoin. They then use their hash power to mine secretly, building an alternative chain. When their chain exceeds the public chain in length, they publish it. The network switches to the longer chain. Transactions in the replaced blocks get reverted. Price crashes. The short position prints money.\n\nDavid Rosenthal, writing on his blog, offers a detailed skeptic’s view of whether this attack is actually feasible. His analysis is worth reading because he identifies practical obstacles the paper’s theoretical framework glosses over. Acquiring 43% of the pre-attack hash rate means buying roughly two years of Bitmain’s production capacity beyond what’s needed to replace obsolete equipment. The purchase would be noticed. Power requirements approach 9.5 gigawatts, roughly double what Meta’s planned Louisiana 5GW data center will need by 2030. That power doesn’t (yet) exist in deployable form.\n\nThe short position presents its own problems. Patrick McKenzie’s explainer on perpetual futures describes how crypto derivatives actually work: frequent settlements, margin requirements, liquidation risk. A leveraged short held for 34 days has high probability of getting liquidated before the attack succeeds, given Bitcoin’s volatility. In nine of twelve months in 2025, an initial 10X leveraged short would have been liquidated within the month. Even if the attack succeeds, the resulting crash would likely trigger automatic deleveraging, reducing winnings precisely when they should be largest.\n\nAn insider attack looks more plausible on paper. A large mining pool already controls the hash rate. The October 2025 liquidation event on crypto exchanges saw $19 billion in forced liquidations. This demonstrates both the volatility of the market and its capacity to absorb large directional moves. But an insider who stops contributing to the public chain for weeks becomes visible. The hash rate is public data. A 30% drop would trigger immediate investigation.\n\nThe paper’s contribution, in my opinion, is making explicit what the derivatives market implies: Bitcoin’s security depends not just on proof-of-work economics but on the assumption that attackers cannot profit from price crashes. That assumption gets weaker as the derivatives market grows. Monthly Bitcoin futures volume on unregulated exchanges has exceeded $2 trillion in recent months. The paper’s calculations used April 2024 data. Since then, Bitcoin’s hash rate has roughly doubled to around 1,100 EH/s, increasing attack costs proportionally. But derivatives volumes have grown too.\n\nThe next halving arrives in April 2028. Mining rewards drop to 1.5625 BTC per block. Miners whose equipment is fully depreciated might view an attack as an exit strategy, particularly if they can monetize it through derivatives. Some large miners are already pivoting to AI data center hosting, suggesting they see diminishing returns from mining alone. Core Scientific plans to exit Bitcoin mining entirely by 2028.\n\nWhat actually prevents this attack? Probably the practical difficulties Rosenthal identifies rather than any fundamental economic barrier. The market should price these risks but appears not to. Bitcoin trades as if 51% attacks are theoretical rather than economically viable. That may remain true as long as practical obstacles hold.\n\nHappy New Year!

    "description": "Bitcoin price enters 2026 in a stalemate. A 1% move at key levels could reveal the winner between buyers and sellers.",
    "fullText": "Bitcoin price enters 2026 stuck in the same buyer-seller fight that kept it muted through late 2025. The price is almost flat over the past 30 days, down about 0.6%, which shows how neither side has taken control.\n\nIt is still down about 7% year on year. This balance of pressure has turned into a stalemate. However, a 1% or even a 3.5% move from here could decide the next direction if the right conditions appear.\n\nBitcoin is trading inside a symmetrical triangle on the daily chart. This shape shows the market trapped between lower highs and higher lows, hinting at the buyer-seller tussle. Capital flows are not helping the upside.\n\nThe Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has trended lower since December 10. For the unversed, the CMF measures how much money flows into or out of an asset. It shows a bearish divergence now because the BTC price has trended higher between December 18 and December 31, while the CMF made lower lows. That signals continued outflows and selling pressure.\n\nWant more token insights like this? \n\nThis negative capital flow is being partially offset by exchange outflows.\n\nExchange net position change shows coins leaving exchanges. That often hints at accumulation. On December 19, exchange outflows were about 16,563 BTC. By January 1, they rose to 38,508 BTC.\n\nThat is an increase of about 132%. This push of coins leaving exchanges helps price stability and keeps the lower trendline of the triangle protected.\n\nSmart Money Index readings confirm the lack of direction. The Smart Money Index compares how larger, informed traders position versus the broader market. The line is hugging its signal line with no clear separation. That hints that larger traders are waiting for a breakout and not betting on either direction yet.\n\nUntil the breakout happens, the triangle stays neutral.\n\nThis matches what CMF and exchange flow data are saying. Outflows signal pressure. Exchange withdrawals signal support. Together, they cancel each other and hold the BTC price still. And even the most informed traders are unsure as to which side would win.\n\nThe cost basis heat map highlights clusters where many buyers last bought. These clusters often act like support or resistance. The nearest resistance zone is around $88,082 to $88,459, where about 200,035 BTC sit.\n\nBitcoin is trading near $87,480. A daily close roughly 1% higher would put the price above that zone. That could act as the first bullish trigger and settle the upper triangle break. On the BTC price chart, the level aligning with this cluster is $88,300, which needs to break first.",

    "description": "What is the biggest crypto news today? Ripple unlocks $1 billion in XRP as 2026 begins. Will re-locking limit real supply impact?",
    "fullText": "Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead.\n\nGrab a coffee and settle in. January is already shaping up to test the patience of XRP traders. While headlines are buzzing about Ripple’s $1 billion escrow unlock, the real story may lie less in the numbers and \n\nRipple is set to unlock 1 billion XRP from escrow on January 1, 2026, marking the first scheduled release of the new year.\n\nAt the current XRP price of $1.88, the headline figure represents roughly $1.9 billion, drawing attention from traders and analysts alike.\n\nYet, history suggests the market impact could be far smaller than the number implies. This is because Ripple’s monthly unlocks are part of a carefully managed supply mechanism rather than a surprise shock.\n\nThe escrow framework, established in 2017, is designed to enhance the transparency and predictability of XRP’s supply.\n\nUnder this schedule, Ripple releases 1 billion XRP each month but typically relocks between 60% and 80% of the tokens, retaining only a fraction for operational or liquidity needs.\n\nIn December 2025, for example, roughly 70% of unlocked XRP was returned to escrow, leaving less than 300–400 million XRP potentially liquid.\n\nIf January follows this pattern, traders may see a limited net supply increase despite the seemingly massive unlock.\n\nStill, the market watches closely. XRP is facing ongoing sell pressure, with a looming risk of a 41% crash. Yet, structural demand appears steady, seen with flows into US spot XRP ETFs.\n\nData on SoSoValue shows XRP ETFs have recorded over 30 consecutive days of inflows, including $15.55 million on December 30 alone. This raises total ETF-held assets to $1.27 billion.\n\nThese inflows highlight confidence in XRP’s long-term positioning among institutions, even amid short-term volatility.\n\nExchange balances add another layer to the supply story. Analysts note that XRP held on exchanges has declined from approximately 4 billion to under 1.5 billion over the past year, suggesting a tightening of the liquid supply.",

    "description": "As most of Donald Trump's crypto empire struggles, Trump Media Group announces new token launch to reward DJT shareholders.",
    "fullText": "Trump Media & Technology Group shareholders may be receiving a late Christmas gift shortly after the 2025 holiday season, though the exact date isn't clear.\n\nThe Truth Social parent has announced plans to issue a new crypto to its investor base. In a company statement released on Wednesday, December 31, the company revealed that it will distribute the token in partnership with Crypto.com and that it will operate on the Cronos blockchain.\n\nWhile the statement noted that Trump Media expects each DJT shareholder to receive one token for every share they hold, no specific timing has been provided yet. The company also said that those who receive these tokens may also be given rewards in the coming year, which may include discounts on company products.\n\nThis decision comes at a time when digital assets with ties to the Trump name have struggled significantly and are facing increasing scrutiny from both finance pros and investors. The Trump family lost roughly $1 billion in the recent crypto market meltdown, primarily due to bitcoin's steep decline and the $Trump meme coin falling sharply. American Bitcoin Corp, a company in which Eric Trump is a primary shareholder, has struggled significantly since its September IPO, falling 14% year-to-date.\n\nAs the crypto market continues to struggle, this new crypto offering, intended to reward Trump Media shareholders after a difficult year, may raise some questions. Haonan Li, founder of stablecoin merchant platform Codex, noted that it is entering the market at a less-than-ideal time.\n\n\"Projects like this are entering a much more skeptical market,\" he told Business Insider. \"Investors already have many ways to get crypto exposure, and spreading a strategy across multiple Trump-linked vehicles risks diluting demand rather than concentrating it.\"\n\n$Trump coin's recent performance may also raise concern, as it could be viewed as an indication of instability for the new crypto. The meme coin has fallen 14% over the past month. Meanwhile, the $MELANIA Trump meme coin plunged shortly after its launch in January 2025 and is down 94% for the year.\n\nLi also noted that the world of crypto is ever-changing and with it, the rules that drive the volatile market. In his view, the last crypto cycle was dominated by narratives, as real economic activity was constrained by regulation. But the market has shifted since then and the outlook is starkly different.\n\n\"The lines are blurring, but investors are far more discerning than last cycle, and simply copying what worked before will not be enough,\" he added.\n\nTrump's pro-crypto policies helped boost markets earlier in 2025 as investors viewed it as lending stability to the notoriously volatile asset class, cheering the easing of regulatory roadblocks. But with the year ending on a low note, it is unclear how a crypto created to reward shareholders in a struggling stock will be received.",

In this case, and for these Bitwise ETFs, this means up to 60% in the actual token (like AAVE) and the rest in other ETPs or derivatives that track that token’s price.\n\nThe 11 filings target: Aave (AAVE), Canton (CC), Ethena (ENA), Hyperliquid (HYPE), NEAR Protocol (NEAR), Starknet (STRK), Sui (SUI), Bittensor (TAO), Tron (TRX), Uniswap (UNI), and Zcash (ZEC).\n\nThere is no set date. The filings are the first step in a process that requires SEC review and approval, which can take several months and is not guaranteed.

    "fullText": "Go-ethereum (geth) is the official Go language implementation of the Ethereum protocol's execution layer. It serves as a full node client capable of validating and executing transactions, maintaining blockchain state, participating in peer-to-peer networking, and exposing APIs for user interaction.\n\nThis page provides a high-level architectural overview of the go-ethereum codebase, covering the major subsystems and how they interact. For detailed information about specific components, refer to:\n\nGo-ethereum implements the execution layer of Ethereum's post-merge architecture. It works alongside a consensus layer client (beacon node) to validate and produce blocks. The execution layer is responsible for:\n\nCommunication between layers occurs through the Engine API (eth/catalyst).\n\nSources: README.md1-257 eth/backend.go17-594 eth/ethconfig/config.go17-213\n\nThe geth binary starts at cmd/geth/main.go287 which initializes a CLI application using the urfave/cli framework. The default action invokes geth() at cmd/geth/main.go328 which performs three main steps:\n\nConfiguration Loading: loadBaseConfig() at cmd/geth/config.go142 reads CLI flags and TOML configuration files, producing a gethConfig struct containing node.Config, ethconfig.Config, metrics, and ethstats settings.\n\nNode Creation: makeFullNode() at cmd/geth/config.go223 creates a node.Node instance and registers the Ethereum service via eth.New() at eth/backend.go131\n\nNode Startup: startNode() at cmd/geth/main.go344 calls lifecycle methods to start all registered services.\n\nSources: cmd/geth/main.go217-416 cmd/geth/config.go51-340 eth/backend.go91-594\n\nThe central coordination point is the Ethereum struct defined at eth/backend.go92 which aggregates all major subsystems:\n\nSources: eth/backend.go91-594 cmd/geth/config.go222-311\n\nGo-ethereum uses a hierarchical configuration system supporting multiple input sources:\n\nConfiguration precedence (highest to lowest):\n\nThe gethConfig struct at cmd/geth/config.go107-112 contains three main configuration sections:\n\nSources: cmd/geth/config.go107-180 cmd/utils/flags.go81-1027 eth/ethconfig/config.go40-213\n\nGo-ethereum includes built-in configurations for multiple networks:\n\nNetworks are selected via CLI flags (--mainnet, --sepolia, --holesky, --hoodi) which set the appropriate ChainConfig from params/config.go\n\nSources: params/config.go29-427 cmd/utils/flags.go144-163\n\nThis sequence demonstrates how a transaction moves from user submission to block inclusion in the post-merge architecture:\n\nSources: miner/worker.go1-1820 eth/catalyst/api.go1-868 core/blockchain.go1-2500\n\nEvery Ethereum network starts from a genesis block defined by the Genesis struct at core/genesis.go57-76:\n\nThe ChainConfig at params/config.go433-494 defines the fork activation schedule:\n\nGenesis initialization occurs in SetupGenesisBlock() at core/genesis.go298-398 which:\n\nSources: core/genesis.go45-799 params/config.go428-494\n\nGo-ethereum uses a multi-layered storage system optimized for different data types and access patterns:\n\nState Database (core/state/statedb.go70-177): Provides transactional state access with:\n\nTrie Database (triedb/database.go): Manages Merkle Patricia Trie nodes with two schemes:\n\nSnapshot (core/state/snapshot): Flat account/storage representation for O(1) lookups:\n\nAncient Store (core/rawdb/freezer.go): Append-only storage for immutable historical data (blocks, receipts)\n\nSources: core/state/statedb.go1-1700 triedb/database.go1-600 core/state/snapshot1-1000\n\nGo-ethereum implements peer-to-peer networking for blockchain data exchange:\n\nSnap Sync (default, --syncmode snap):\n\nThe Downloader at eth/downloader/downloader.go coordinates sync across multiple peers with:\n\nSources: eth/downloader/downloader.go1-2000 eth/handler.go1-700 p2p/server.go1-1000\n\nGo-ethereum exposes multiple API interfaces:\n\nThe JSON-RPC implementation is in internal/ethapi with the EthAPIBackend at eth/api_backend.go providing access to blockchain state.\n\nSources: internal/ethapi/api.go1-2400 eth/api_backend.go1-400 node/api.go1-500\n\nPost-merge, go-ethereum operates in tandem with a consensus layer client. The Engine API (eth/catalyst/api.go) implements the execution engine specification:\n\nAuthentication uses JWT tokens specified via --authrpc.jwtsecret. The API listens on port 8551 by default (configurable via --authrpc.port).\n\nFor development, the SimulatedBeacon at eth/catalyst/simulated_beacon.go provides a standalone mode (--dev) that automatically produces blocks without an external consensus client.\n\nSources: eth/catalyst/api.go1-868 eth/catalyst/simulated_beacon.go1-400\n\nThe build system at build/ci.go supports:\n\nThe codebase requires Go 1.23+ and a C compiler (for certain dependencies like KZG commitments).\n\nSources: build/ci.go1-1000 README.md16-31 Makefile1-100\n\nGo-ethereum is a complex, production-grade implementation of the Ethereum execution layer. Its architecture separates concerns into distinct subsystems (state, blockchain, networking, consensus integration) while maintaining clear interfaces between components. The configuration system provides flexibility for different network deployments, and the post-merge Engine API enables seamless integration with any compatible consensus client.\n\nFor deeper exploration of specific subsystems, refer to the subsequent pages in this wiki covering Node Lifecycle, Core Components, Networking, Storage, and APIs.",

    "fullText": "Last few months of the year have seen $1tn in value wiped from the market, despite all-time-high price of bitcoin\n\nAs 2025 comes to a close, Donald Trump’s favorable approach to cryptocurrency has not proven to be enough to sustain the industry’s gains, once the source of market-wide optimism and enthusiasm. The last few months of the year have seen $1tn in value wiped from the digital asset market, despite bitcoin hitting an all-time-high price of $126,000 on 6 October.\n\nThe October price peak was short-lived. Bitcoin’s price tumbled just days later after Trump’s announcement of 100% tariffs on China sent shockwaves across the market on 12 October. The crypto market saw $19bn liquidated in 24 hours – the largest liquidation event on record. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, saw a 40% drop in price over the next month. Eric Trump’s own crypto company endured a similar drop in its value in December.\n\nIn Donald Trump, the crypto industry was delivered the pro-bitcoin president they were promised during his campaign. Within days of taking office for the second time, he issued an executive order that repealed restrictions on cryptocurrency and introduced new favorable regulations as well as a presidential working group on digital assets.\n\n“The digital asset industry plays a crucial role in innovation and economic development in the United States, as well as our Nation’s international leadership,” the order read. He placed cryptocurrency front and center in American policy.\n\nAgain in March, Trump announced a new strategic cryptocurrency reserve that fueled a 62% rally in the market prices of three out of five of the coins named to the reserve. Bitcoin, the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency, went up 10% to $94,164 in the hours after the reserve was announced.\n\nCryptocurrency is sensitive to both narratives and confidence in global markets, said Rachael Lucas, the head of marketing and communications at BTC Markets, Australia’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. It’s what is called a risk-on asset, an investment that does better when investors are feeling confident about the economy and are willing to take on more risk, Lucas said.\n\n“The Trump administration may be pro-crypto, but tariffs and tight monetary policy outweigh positive vibes,” said Lucas. “And it’s also just a reminder, especially for people in crypto, that macro forces really matter more than political stances.”\n\nIn November, bitcoin suffered its biggest drop in price since 2021, bringing the coin’s value to less than $81,000. While bitcoin regained some of that value in the weeks after, the digital token started December with another slump, dropping 6% after Strategy, the biggest holder of bitcoin, cut its earnings forecast because of the slide in crypto prices. Bitcoin’s price now hovers near $90,000, up from years past but significantly lower than its peak.\n\nIn the first few days of December 2025, Eric Trump’s crypto firm, American Bitcoin Corp, saw 40% of its value – roughly $1bn – wiped out.\n\nThe Trump family scion put on a bullish face and declared he would ride out the decline. “I’m holding all my @ABTC shares - I’m 100% committed to leading the industry,” Eric Trump said on X at the time.\n\nSome experts fear the industry is entering a so-called crypto winter, a prolonged period of stagnation or losses. The last time, crypto winter lasted from the end of 2021 through 2023, when the FTX mogul Sam Bankman-Fried was tried and convicted. Those years saw bitcoin slump 70% in price.\n\nDespite the optimism fueled by Trump’s win, the current market downturn shows the crypto-friendly administration wasn’t enough to usher in a return to the “retail mania” of 2021, when there was a huge upswing in individual stock trading, said Christian Catalini, the founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab.\n\n“The recent crash isn’t a change in sentiment, but a collision of three structural factors: the aftershocks of a $19bn leverage washout in October; a risk-off rotation driven by US-China tariff tensions; and, crucially, the potential unraveling of the corporate treasury trade,” Catalini said.\n\nAnother potential factor that may have shaken the crypto market is the downturn in share prices of AI stocks like Nvidia, said Lucas.\n\n“One of the reasons why bitcoin is tied to the AI cycle is because a lot of the bitcoin miners actually started leveraging their energy towards new datacenters,” she said. “Not only is crypto a technical asset, we have the miners actually tied into AI devices going up. That negative sentiment tends to sneak into crypto.”\n\nDespite concerns over a crypto winter, notable players in the crypto space Larry Fink, the CEO of investment management firm BlackRock, and Brian Armstrong, the co-founder of Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US, expressed optimism about the long-term value of the currency at a recent New York Times conference. Armstrong said “there was no chance” the price of bitcoin would go to zero and in fact 2025 would be seen as the year “when crypto went from gray market to a well-lit establishment”. Fink, for his part, said his firm had observed “legitimate long owners investing in the currency”, including sovereign wealth funds.\n\nLucas said that this downturn in crypto prices was not inconsistent with past four-year bitcoin cycles and that she was not worried about entering a much more sustained crypto winter.\n\n“If I was looking at it from a traditional bitcoin cycle, we are actually technically in a bear market,” said Lucas. “But as you can see, even with all of these macros that are affecting the market, bitcoin has still managed to set a price above $80,000.”",

    "fullText": "Crypto investment products continue to see outflows towards the end of the year.\n\nBitcoin led the outflows in the past week, while Solana and XRP continue to see inflows for another week.\n\nThe weekly flows indicate a cautious approach by investors.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have continued to experience massive outflows towards the end of the year.\n\nAt a time when BTC and ETH investment products continue to see outflows, Solana and XRP ETFs have maintained their market-defying momentum, recording their most significant weekly inflows since inception.\n\nCrypto investment products saw outflows of $446 million last week, bringing total outflows since the October 10th shock price decline to $3.2 billion.\n\nDespite the recent drawdown, year-to-date inflows remain robust at $46.3 billion, slightly below 2024’s $48.7 billion, while total assets under management (AUM) are still up 10% YTD.\n\nBitcoin investment products accounted for the bulk of last week’s outflows, shedding $443 million, while Ethereum products followed with $59.5 million in outflows.\n\nIn contrast, newer products continued to attract capital. Solana and XRP ETFs both posted their strongest weekly inflows since launch, defying the broader trend.\n\nXRP ETFs recorded $79 million in net inflows, while Solana ETFs added more than $7.5 million.\n\nThe divergence suggests investor confidence is becoming increasingly selective, with capital rotating toward XRP and Solana exposure even as funds continue to exit Bitcoin and Ethereum products.\n\nExamining the weekly flow of crypto investment products, investors remain cautious about the value of BTC and ETH heading into the end of the year.\n\nBTC’s price reclaimed $90,000, while the ETH price climbed above $ 3,000.\n\nHowever, like several past instances since October, both tokens failed to sustain the bullish momentum and lost all of their gains within hours of breaking past key resistance.\n\nOn the other hand, altcoin spot prices remain in the bearish zone; however, due to the recent launch of these products, investors are more open to taking risks with them, as evident from XRP’s zero outflow days, while Solana has seen key inflows from time to time.\n\nThe United States remains the hub of most flows, owing to the launch of some of the largest ETF products in the country.\n\nGermany’s inflows suggest opportunistic buying during market dips, while the US dominated the negative flows.\n\nThe post Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs Continues Outflows While Solana and XRP Record Largest Inflow appeared first on ccn.com.",

Also read up on how North Korean hackers were responsible for over $2 billion in crypto losses in 2025.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime.\n\nThe FTC estimated that Americans lost 12.5 billion dollars to scams in 2024. That was a 25% increase from a year earlier. and in 2025 attacks are growing in scope and scale, even taking advantage of trusted sites like LinkedIn. One company trying to protect consumers is Push security. Mark Orlando, Push's chief technology officer joins me now. Mark, it is great to see you. So so maybe start here Mark, you know, as the year draws to a close, we're rolling into 2026, Mark. What what is the big\n\ncybersecurity themes, Mark, we should be aware of. What what are the big trends? Scale, for example, seems to be one you're highlighting.\n\nHi Josh, absolutely. Scale is uh really one of the biggest developments that we've seen not only this year but in the last few years, as the infrastructure behind these types of attacks gets easier and easier to stand up and operate. I think we can expect the scale of these attacks to continue growing exponentially. We've also seen the sophistication of these attacks uh really getting getting higher and higher. Uh you mentioned exploiting\n\nlegitimate sites and services like LinkedIn, um but we're seeing that across the board, whether it's social media networks or uh sponsored ads in Google results, attackers have come up with some very creative and sophisticated ways to deliver these scams and these attacks to unsuspecting users.\n\nIt sounds like, Mark, you're also highlighting how more attacks are are happening inside the browser. Why is that, Mark? I mean, just technically technically speaking, how does that how does that help the attacker?\n\nSure, well the browser has really evolved from a tool that we use to view web pages to, you know, essentially a platform that runs software on demand. I mean, this is where, you know, work really happens these days including, you know, where users are logging into all of the various accounts and services that we use on a daily basis. So, uh attackers realized this and they have kind of shifted away from uh different areas of the network like email uh or, you know, strictly web access that are fairly well defended into the browser, which is somewhat\n\nless well defended, certainly an area where most organizations don't have great visibility into what's going on and how users are interacting with websites. So, attackers have realized this, they've shifted focus to doing \n\nYou also highlight here, Mark, uh what sound like these LinkedIn-based fishing attacks. explain those, Mark, how do they work?\n\nSure. So, I think historically when you talk about fishing or email scams, I mean it is strictly that. It's something that's coming through email. and I think more or less that's what users have come to expect. if they're going to get scammed, it's going to be some, you know, poorly worded kind of suspicious email that comes in with an attachment or a link. And really that's uh increasingly no longer the case. So, uh you mentioned LinkedIn, we identified an attack campaign uh earlier this year where\n\nuh a an executive, a CEO in fact, uh of a company we work with was targeted through LinkedIn. He received a message from someone in his network, a first-level connection uh about something that was very relevant to that company and to his work. And so uh he clicked on the link, you know, along the lines of hey, check out this investment information, this opportunity, let me know what you think. Uh there was a lot of kind of sophisticated um\n\nkind of hoops he had to jump through to validate that it was in fact, uh him who was accessing the attacker website. and ultimately the goal was uh to gather his login information. So, in fact, it wasn't the trusted contact that had sent this message through LinkedIn, but rather someone else who had compromised his contact's uh account. So, this is a a situation where not only is the message very, very convincing, but it comes from a a trusted source, in this case, you know, a trusted known contact.\n\nSo, very, very difficult to pick out. and again, very difficult for an organization to see what's happening inside of those LinkedIn communications, much less do anything to stop it.",

At the time, San Francisco-based Coinbase estimated the incident could cost up to $400 million to remedy.",

    "fullText": "Gold (GC=F) and silver (SI=F) investors are taking a victory lap this year as crypto bulls are left in the dust.\n\nOn Friday, gold futures rose above $4,550 to hover at or near record highs, capping a year marked by more than 50 such records.\n\nMeanwhile, silver also jumped over $75 per ounce, extending its year-to-date gains to 150% in a parabolic rally driven by concerns about physical shortages during a time of robust industrial demand. Platinum (PL=F) and copper (HG=F) have also soared to records this year.\n\nSome investors have been quick to point out the divergence between the metals industry and cryptocurrency, which has been led by a leg lower in bitcoin (BTC-USD), down roughly 6% year-to-date. Ether (ETH-USD) is also on track for a yearly loss of 12%.\n\n\"With gold now up almost 70% in 2025 and most cryptocurrencies negative, the time has come for the crypto crowd to switch to gold, \" Louis Navellier, founder of Navellier & Associates, noted earlier this week.\n\nNavellier points to central bank purchases, lower volatility, and improved liquidity in the gold market compared with cryptocurrencies.\n\nMeanwhile, gold bull Peter Schiff, a notorious critic of crypto, stated on X, \"If Bitcoin won’t go up when tech stocks rise, and it won’t go up when gold and silver rise, when will it go up? The answer is: it won’t.\"\n\nThe metals' climb to all-time highs comes as crypto is on track to end the year in negative territory, with bitcoin trying to avoid a third consecutive losing month.\n\nThe world’s largest cryptocurrency has diverged from stocks for the first time since 2014, despite a favorable regulatory environment and increasing crypto adoption on Wall Street.\n\nThe token has struggled to recover after long-term holders sold, and forced liquidations sent prices sliding roughly 30% from record highs near $126,000 in October to just over $87,000 on Friday.\n\nFundstrat's head of digital assets Sean Farrell said he isn't surprised that bitcoin has been trading in a tight range recently.\n\n\"Santa rallies are normally characterized by folks selling losers, buying winners into the year-end,\" said Farrell in a client video earlier this week.\n\n\"I just think a lot of folks are not stepping in here to put on a lot of risk in an asset that has underperformed for the better part of the last couple of months,\" he added.\n\nThe strategist said he believes there is a compelling setup for a bounce in January, as inflows are expected to increase from investors adopting bitcoin for their long-term portfolios.",

    "description": "Bitcoin is on pace to end 2025 having lost money for its investors.",
    "fullText": "Looser monetary policy, with lower interest rates and quantitative easing, can drive demand for Bitcoin as investors seek higher returns.\n\nThere is a lot of fear, uncertainty, and doubt about quantum computing's impact on Bitcoin, worries that appear to be overblown.\n\nBitcoin has historically bounced back after down years.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Bitcoin ›\n\nAccording to data from asset manager BlackRock, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has produced a higher return compared to every other asset class in eight of 11 years from the start of 2013 through 2023. Bitcoin was then up 119% in 2024.\n\nThat hot streak is about to end this year, with the top digital asset declining 7% in 2025 (as of Dec. 23). At the same time, the S&P 500 index has produced a total return of almost 18%, marking its third straight year of double-digit percentage gains.\n\nMaybe next year will be better for Bitcoin. Is the world's dominant cryptocurrency positioned to bounce back and outperform the market in 2026?\n\nIn September 2024, the Federal Reserve decided to cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time since it raised the rate in July 2023. After this, the central bank conducted five more rate cuts. Generally speaking, declining interest rates are a boon for risk assets, a group that includes Bitcoin. From an investor's perspective, lower yields in fixed income products are not as attractive, leading to a greater focus on assets that could earn higher returns. These rate cuts are also accommodative to the economy, which can drive revenue and earnings growth for companies, in turn supporting higher valuations and stock prices.\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. central bank has effectively started quantitative easing (QE), having announced plans to purchase $40 billion of Treasury Bills each month. The last time QE started was on March 15, 2020, to jump-start the economy after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the subsequent 12 months, Bitcoin soared more than 1,000%.\n\nLower interest rates and QE provide a very favorable environment in which more liquidity gets pumped into the financial system. Bitcoin, as a global macro asset, is definitely affected by this. Investors can look at two key metrics to watch this trend: federal debt and M2 money supply. Both have rapidly expanded in the recent past, with no reason to believe they shouldn't do the same in 2026.\n\nThe macroeconomic situation looks to be working in Bitcoin's favor as we set our sights on the new year.\n\nBased on its historical average, the S&P 500 generates an annualized 10% total return. If this is what happens in 2026, then Bitcoin has a very low hurdle rate to clear in order to outperform the benchmark index. In addition to the macro forces already mentioned, there are two reasons the leading cryptocurrency is poised to do extremely well next year.",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin had a baby! Ethereum was born! And the Ethereum price is finally rebounding, up 3.9% over the last week.\n\nMoreover, year-end fate is about to be decided by derivatives, not headlines. Roughly $6 Bn in ETH options expire Friday, and despite call options outnumbering puts by more than 2.2 times, the structure still favors bears unless price can reclaim key levels fast. Here’s what to know:\n\nETH has failed to hold above $3,400 for more than 40 days, a stretch that has steadily drained bullish conviction. Most calls were placed between $3,500 and $5,000, reflecting expectations that Ether would close 2025 near $4,000 before the 28% November drawdown shattered that thesis.\n\nAs a result, more than $4.1 Bn in call options are now at risk of expiring worthless.\n\nDISCOVER: Top 20 Crypto to Buy in 2025\n\nPut positioning is more grounded. Bears clustered protection between $2,200 and $2,900 levels. If ETH settles between $2,700 and $2,900, puts win by roughly $580 Mn.\n\nEven a $2,901 to $3,000 close still favors bears by $440 Mn. Bulls only reach parity above $3,100, with a modest $150 Mn advantage emerging above $3,200.\n\nDerivatives flows explain the chop for the Ethereum price. ETH has hovered around $3,000 while dealers hedge exposure, keeping spot pinned inside a narrow band. If price holds above $2,950, more than 60% of $1.9 Bn in puts expire worthless, easing downside pressure but not flipping the trend outright.\n\nDISCOVER: Next 1000X Crypto: 10+ Crypto Tokens That Can Hit 1000x in 2025\n\nEthereum options activity shows traders rolling exposure into late-2025 and 2026 expiries rather than loading up on shorts for this week. Similar positioning appeared in mid-2023 and early 2024 before delayed breakouts materialized.\n\nMacro stress is adding caution. Additionally, weakness in US semiconductor manufacturing and softer AI-linked optimism have pushed traders toward hedges like bear put spreads and bear call spreads after repeated failures at $3,400.\n\nThe upshot is this: you are the Christmas miracle, Anon. You’re a beautiful and caring person and you have people who love you. Oh, and this week will be big for the ETH price; expect volatility.\n\nEXPLORE: Singapore Denies Do Kwon’s $14M Refund Demand For ‘Stolen’ Penthouse\n\nRead original story $6B Options Expiry Weighs on Ethereum Price by Isaiah Mccall at 99bitcoins.com",

    "fullText": "Nikhil Kamath, a renowned Indian billionaire, recently told CoinDCX CEO Sumit Gupta that he does not have a single Bitcoin to his name nor has he ever invested in other crypto. He clarified that he was not so familiar with the concept of cryptocurrencies, even though he interacts with some of the top players within the blockchain industry.\n\nDuring Kamath’s conversation with Gupta, the billionaire and co-founder of Zerodha hinted at his interest to pursue BTC by 2026, even though he has never owned Bitcoin before now. As someone who claims to have less knowledge about Bitcoin and other digital currencies, he says that he is open to learning about the space and exploring it further.\n\nThis revelation was made when CoinDCX CEO sought to know about Kamath’s views on blockchain and Bitcoin. His response may have come as a surprise to many people considering that Kamath has conversed with top leaders on his WTF podcast.\n\nThis includes top industry players like Elon Musk, Nandan Nilekani, Ruchir Sharma, Ray Dalio and many more.\n\nInterestingly, a handful of these entities are focused on blockchain and crypto, but it appears that Kamath did not tap from that aspect of their knowledge. He unashamedly admitted the limitation of his knowledge on the subject.\n\nDuring one of his podcasts with Musk, the Tesla boss equated Bitcoin with “energy,” which he believes to be the “true currency.”\n\nSome entities suspect that Kamath may just be taking a cautious stance on the subject of crypto, especially considering India’s position with digital assets. India once stated that it has no plans to regulate the crypto sector for now, citing concerns that it could expose the country’s financial system to risks.\n\nThe authorities in the region have agreed that a complete ban could tackle speculative activities, but at the same time, it wouldn’t prevent peer-to-peer transfers or decentralized trading.\n\nOn one hand, India has become more lenient towards the burgeoning crypto industry in recent months. Last October, Coinbase Global Inc., an American cryptocurrency exchange strengthened its presence in India and the Middle East by making a major investment in CoinDCX. This came 3 years after the same exchange exited the country.\n\nRead original story Indian Billionaire Nikhil Kamath Eyes Bitcoin Exposure in 2026 by Godfrey Benjamin at Coinspeaker.com",

The exchange’s bankruptcy and subsequent arrest of Sam Bankman-Fried rocked the market, just a year after it had celebrated new highs.\n\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nWall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n\nIn this backdrop, Cramer appeared on CNBC on Dec. 23, stating that the faith of the American people has been shaken.\n\n“I sold all my crypto. I announced everything on TV, what I did with crypto,” the “Mad Money” host said. “I wouldn’t touch crypto in a million years.”\n\nCramer also took a dig at those who put their coins on unregulated trading platforms.\n\n“If you have your money in any of those, look, I’m not calling you an idiot. I’m just saying you’re using a lot of blind faith,” he said.\n\nTrending: Forget Flipping Houses—This Fund Lets You Invest in Home Equity Like Wall Street Does\n\nBitcoin traded at $16,796 when Cramer made these remarks.\n\nFast forward three years, and the apex cryptocurrency is worth $86,805 apiece, marking a whopping return of 416%. So, if you adopted the \"Inverse Cramer\" strategy, you’d be laughing all the way to the bank today.\n\nNote that there has been no definitive proof of this being a profitable strategy.

Last week, he said that he just wants Bitcoin, not any derivative or Bitcoin treasury companies.\n\nEarlier in the year, he advocated for Bitcoin as a hedge against the escalating U.S. national debt, stating that he was buying a lot himself.",

These are just some of the labels admirers and critics have attached to Pavel Durov over the past decade.\n\nThe Russian-born tech entrepreneur founded Russia’s version of Facebook before going on to create the messaging app Telegram, launch a cryptocurrency ecosystem and amass a multibillion-dollar fortune, all while clashing repeatedly with authorities in Russia and beyond.\n\nBut much of Durov’s real story – and the logic that drives him – remains obscured.\n\nA new biography aims to change that.\n\nThe Populist, by the independent Russian writer Nikolay Kononov, traces the 41-year-old’s rise from a St Petersburg schoolboy science prodigy to the founder of Telegram, one of the world’s most influential communications platforms, which has more than a billion users.\n\nKononov describes the book as the product of a 14-year attempt to map Durov’s strategy and mindset, drawing on conversations with Durov himself and people who worked with him, as well as rivals and critics.\n\nThe book’s title, he said, refers to a thread running through Durov’s life: his desire to address Telegram’s millions of users directly, allowing him to bypass institutions, the press and any system of representation.\n\n“Durov is one of the first digital populists,” Kononov said in an interview, explaining that “from the very beginning, as soon as he started making his digital products, he programmed into them the ability to write and communicate his ideas directly to his audience.”.\n\nBoth VKontakte, Durov’s first venture, and Telegram have at times pushed messages from Durov directly to all users, including users who had not opted in, outlining his libertarian worldview.\n\n“He sees himself as a visionary. And obviously wants to be heard,” the author said.\n\nThat strategy has helped promote Durov’s central promise – almost absolute freedom of expression – even as Telegram has become a go-to tool for dissidents, extremists, scammers and war propagandists.\n\nIf Durov’s public brand is built on libertarianism, Kononov says his private management style points in the opposite direction: power concentrated in one man’s hands, with few visible checks.\n\n“He is essentially the only one making all the product decisions at Telegram,” Kononov said. “Marketing, PR – it’s a one-man show.”\n\nThe portrait he draws is of a tech founder whose worldview has not wavered over the years, remaining most comfortable within an ultra-libertarian, anti-institutional strand of the right that is often misogynistic and, at times, conspiratorial.\n\n“What surprised me most is that Durov hasn’t changed or evolved in all the years that I have interviewed him,” Kononov said.\n\nDurov is not an outlier, Kononov writes, but part of a broader new wave of moguls – most visibly in the US – who pair technological dominance with an outsized sense of personal mythology and a deep suspicion of government constraint.\n\nLike Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Jeff Bezos, he has shown a strong interest in longevity science as well as pronatalism, the belief that having as many children as possible is a social or civilisational duty.\n\nDurov does not drink or use drugs, Kononov says, regularly dispenses spartan health advice – often alongside photos of him shirtless – and has said he has fathered dozens of children through sperm donation.\n\nOne of the book’s most striking sections tells for the first time of Durov’s tense early meeting with President Vladimir Putin in 2014, held behind closed doors.\n\nKononov writes that Durov described the encounter as a one-way conversation, in which the Kremlin leader reprimanded him over illegal content on Vkontakte and suggested that Durov leave the country.\n\nUnder pressure from the authorities, Durov sold his stake in Vkontakte, left Russia and eventually settled in Dubai, where he founded Telegram.\n\nBut the clearest mark on Durov in recent years, Kononov suggests, came not from Russia but from France.\n\nDurov, who also holds French citizenship, was detained and held for three days in France in August last year as part of an investigation into crimes linked to Telegram, including the circulation of child sexual abuse images, drug trafficking and fraudulent transactions.\n\nHis detention came as a shock to the tech mogul. In interviews conducted in Paris after his arrest, Durov described to Kononov a harsh, disorienting ordeal – a permanently lit cell and little sleep – that rattled a man who had spent years insulating himself from the reach of the state.\n\nIt also appears to have sharpened his hostility towards the west. Kononov says Durov now frames Europe as sliding toward “total digital control”, and increasingly conspiratorial rhetoric.\n\nMost recently, Durov appeared to endorse a conspiracy theory promoted by the far-right blogger Candace Owens, suggesting that Paris was behind the killing of Charlie Kirk.\n\n“What interests me about Durov is that, on the one hand, he clearly has a very high IQ,” Kononov said. “But at the same time, he is prone to conspiracy theories.”\n\nKononov is adamant, however, that Durov’s views should not be conflated with formal political allegiances.\n\nOne of the most persistent claims surrounding Durov is that he is secretly aligned with Russian security services.\n\nBut Kononov said that in the course of his research, he found no evidence that Durov has worked with, or on behalf of, the Russian state. “He has a huge number of flaws – but not the sin of Telegram acting as a backdoor for the FSB,” Kononov said.\n\nKononov argues that what Durov has ultimately learned is the need to compromise – with both Russian and western authorities – when it serves his interests and allows Telegram to continue operating.\n\nKononov recalls Durov once telling him: “I never waste time on things that are unnecessary or that cannot be useful to me personally.” That self-serving mindset, Kononov said, ultimately ended their personal relationship.\n\nAbout a year ago, the writer asked Durov whether he saw a contradiction between Telegram’s highly centralised, almost authoritarian internal structure and his professed devotion to freedom of expression. After that, Durov stopped responding.\n\n“He quickly realised it wasn’t going to be a book to his liking,” Kononov said.",

And so what is that telling you about what we should be watching and where it could be going in 2026?\n\nWell, just from a pure technical standpoint, we're sort of trying to scrape our way back over the 200-day moving average if we're looking at Bitcoin, and that would be a move over 91,000. I think that would be a sigh of relief to the balls.\n\nAnd if we break down under 85, obviously that would be some trouble.\n\nAnd what's interesting about the technicals right now, Julie, is that it's perfectly coinciding with the biggest news that could impact in uh Bitcoin right now, which is that MSCI and uh possibly the S&P 500 and the FTSE are all talking about the potential of removing strategy, Micro strategy, um Michael Sailor's company from the listing uh on the S&P 500\n\nthat fate could be decided as soon as January 15th. That would have tremendous implications because essentially, and and by the way, when that news came out, that's where we started to see the top.\n\nThat would have the implication would be first of all, a cash removal of 8 to 9 billion dollars for one, but more importantly perhaps, is that all this mass adoption that we just talked about would now come into question as institutional investors would basically be rejecting it.\n\nNow, this is very political, some people will say. Goldman Sachs behind it, they may have some reasons, uh it may not even go through, but I think it's something you have to watch.\n\nSo coiled spring. If it doesn't go through, I think we'll see a massive rally and if it does, that 65,000 may may not even hold.",

    "description": "Cryptocurrency Exchange Architecture is the framework of a crypto platform, ensuring efficient trade matching, secure wallets, liquidity handling, and smooth user interaction for reliable trading",
    "fullText": "Cryptocurrency exchange architecture forms the foundation of every trading platform, determining how trades are executed, funds are secured, and users interact. In 2026, with over 200 active exchanges globally and centralized platforms like Binance handling nearly 40% of the world’s spot trading volume, having a secure, scalable, and high-performance architecture is more important than ever.\n\nAs the crypto ecosystem evolves, exchange platforms are adopting new technologies, from hybrid and decentralized models to advanced security protocols and automated liquidity management. These innovations ensure faster transactions, enhanced user experience, and regulatory compliance, positioning modern exchanges to meet the demands of both retail and institutional traders.\n\nIn this blog, we’ll explore the latest trends, core components, and architectural advancements shaping cryptocurrency exchanges today.\n\nCryptocurrency exchange architecture is the technical blueprint of an exchange, defining how the trading engine matches orders, how funds are stored, and how users interact. Leveraging scalable engines, real-time order books, and intuitive frontends, a well-designed architecture ensures fast, secure, and compliant operations, supporting both high-volume traders and everyday users in a reliable, seamless environment.\n\nWhen built well, this architecture makes the exchange fast, secure, and dependable. Conversely, poorly designed architecture can lead to downtime, security vulnerabilities, or slow, frustrating user experiences, issues that can quickly harm an exchange’s reputation in today’s competitive market.\n\nTo understand how exchanges are built, here are the primary building blocks:\n\nAny exchange revolves around the trading or matching engine. It pairs buy and sell orders according to the rules such as price-time priority. The engine also needs to be able to process millions of orders in a second with a small latency in the high-performance systems. As an example, the matching engine of Binance can handle very large throughput\n\nLiquidity is the capacity to sell or purchase assets very easily without any major alterations in prices. Trades employ various liquidity designs: centralized order books with designated market makers, on-chain liquidity books (in the case of DEXs), or hybrid. The architecture should facilitate effective access to liquidity, potentially with a combination of several sources.\n\nThe manner in which an exchange manages user money is of the essence. Other exchanges are custodial (they custody user wallets), non-custodial (the user retains control with private keys). Hybrid models may allow both. The wallet architecture also determines the nature of handling deposits, withdrawals, and cold/ hot storage in a secure way.\n\nOrder book records outstanding buys/sell orders. Exchanges can be on-chain (occasionally deployed on pure DEX), off-chain or in-memory. The structure of the order book has an impact on performance, transparency and security.\n\nIt has no compromise on security: It includes authentication (KYC, 2FA), fund security (Multi-sig, cold storage), smart contract audits (DEX), and resistance to trading risks, such as front-running, MEV, or DDoS. These security layers should be in-built in the architecture.\n\nTrade is made easy, responsive and trustworthy with the good front end. The UX should receive order placement, charting, account and wallet connections, and give real-time feedback.\n\nA robust admin panel allows operators to monitor trades, manage liquidity, configure markets, and handle risk. Modern exchanges also include crypto exchange APIs for automated tools, third-party integrations, and liquidity management, essential for scalability in turnkey deployments.\n\nIn particular, the fiat on-ramps and off-ramps (banks, payment processors) come in handy, especially when it comes to centralized exchanges. The architecture should be equipped with trustworthy and secure payment systems to exchange crypto and fiat.\n\nThere are various types of cryptocurrency exchange that have their own architecture, features, advantages, and trade-offs. Knowing such types assists the user, the developer and investors to assess performance, security and usability.\n\nCentralized exchanges operate on a traditional client-server model, where the platform manages user accounts, wallets, and order matching. Trades are executed through a central server, which allows for high-speed transactions, deep liquidity, and fiat integration. Such are Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. As convenient and quick to trade, CEXs force the user to leave their money in the hands of the platform to be hacked.\n\nDEXs run on blockchain networks and smart contracts, enabling peer-to-peer trading without a central authority. Users keep control over their money decreasing counterparty risk. Liquidity is dealt with by order books or automated market makers (AMMs). These are Uniswap and dYdX. DEXs are more transparent, secure, and decentralized, although they can be slower in their transactions and have more expensive network charges than CEXs.\n\nHybrid exchanges are built on the combination of CEXs and DEXs features to provide both speed and liquidity with the added non-custodial security. Ordinarily, the way an order matching is conducted is off-chain and then settled on-chain. This is the most optimal solution because it offers the speed of trading, lower charges and enables users to have greater control over funds. The hybrid models are becoming popular to bridge between centralized convenience and decentralized trust.\n\nP2P exchanges connect buyers and sellers directly, allowing them to trade crypto using local currencies or payment methods. The platform usually serves as an escrow service to brush off transactions and fraud. They are Paxful and LocalBitcoins. P2P exchanges offer more options in payment, privacy, and accessibility particularly where banking infrastructure is least developed but might lack liquidity compared to the CEXs.\n\nThe exchange is driven by the backend which deals with trades, liquidity and wallet security, and the front end is to be used to provide the user with a clean, user-friendly interface. The two provide a combination of fast, reliable and safe trading.\n\nCryptocurrency exchange architecture shapes how modern trading platforms operate, from order matching and liquidity flow to wallets, user dashboards, and backend systems. As centralized, decentralized, hybrid, and P2P models grow, the right architectural approach helps ensure smooth trades, consistent performance, and a better trading experience for users.\n\nWith emerging trends like AI-driven trading, Layer 2 networks, cross-chain functionality, and enhanced UX/UI, exchanges are evolving to meet the expectations of both retail and institutional traders. When platforms prioritize strong design, dependable performance, and regulatory alignment, they establish trust and remain competitive in a rapidly evolving market.\n\nIn this landscape, cryptocurrency exchange development is about building a foundation that can adapt to new technologies and industry demands. A well-structured architecture doesn’t just run a platform , it supports long-term growth and shapes the future of your exchange .just run a platform , it supports long-term growth and shapes the future of your exchange.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI is the latest to make a political hire as big tech spreads its tentacles around the world. So what’s the attraction?\n\nGeorge Osborne getting a new job isn’t exactly news. Since leaving frontline politics, the former chancellor has served as the chair of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, edited (not entirely successfully) the Evening Standard, advised asset manager BlackRock, joined boutique advisory firm Robey Warshaw, been appointed as the chair of the British Museum and taken on roles including advising crypto firm Coinbase. Oh, and like any white man of a particular age, he co-hosts a political podcast.\n\nBut Osborne’s latest job is the most eye-opening – and is an alarming augur of what is to come. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, has become the latest organisation to employ Osborne. He will run OpenAI for Countries, a unit tasked with working directly with governments while expanding the company’s Stargate datacentre programme beyond the US. At least it was announced with a tweet, rather than a LinkedIn post.\n\nThe tweet prompted jokes, as did Osborne’s single-handed attempt to boost laggard employment figures brought about by his policies as the chancellor of austerity. But it’s a serious moment, because it’s another sign that the biggest AI firms are starting to behave less like normal companies and more like quasi-governments. They’re negotiating “national” partnerships, pitching a values-led vision of “democratic AI” and hiring former senior politicians as their diplomatic corps. It’s a similar path we have seen from other industries, including oil, pharma and defence, in previous decades – which is why it’s important to try to recognise the risks and head them off before AI companies can repeat the same trick.\n\nThe initiative Osborne is heading up, OpenAI for Countries, does what it says on the tin. It’s designed to embed OpenAI’s models and infrastructure inside the machinery of states, becoming an invaluable, indefatigable part of the running of our lives. OpenAI is in talks with about 50 countries to provide them with critical national infrastructure. Whether you welcome Osborne being put in that role rather than a tech executive is a little like Hobson’s choice: who do you distrust the least? But it’s an indication of how tech companies see their position in society that they are hiring such high-powered people for these roles.\n\nOsborne is not the first to don the branded hoodie and Silicon Valley lifestyle. His fellow coalition government bod Nick Clegg blazed the trail as head of global affairs for Meta. At the time of his initial hiring as a vice-president at Facebook in 2018, his appointment was treated as a PR move – a big name to help the company navigate scandal and scrutiny. But it hinted that platforms had become political actors, whether they liked it or not. The industry’s outsized spending on lobbyists (€151m in Europe alone at the last count) to support the political beasts is an indication of what is at stake. The numbers involved also hint at the scale of the prize that tech companies see: the 10 largest big tech firms now outspend the biggest 10 companies in the pharma, finance and automotive industries combined.\n\nThe former chancellor isn’t even the first former controller of the UK public purse to be handy to big tech. In October of this year, Rishi Sunak took advisory roles with Microsoft and the AI firm Anthropic, less than two years after he convened the AI safety summit at Bletchley Park. Sunak, at least, already had the regulation hoodie in his wardrobe.\n\nYou can read these moves in two ways. The generous interpretation is that these companies are hedging: trying to anticipate tech regulation and ensure they understand it. The more cynical interpretation is that they are attempting to shape the geopolitical story around AI from inside the machine, hiring former leaders less for their technical insight than their institutional muscle memory and networks.\n\nEither way, it leaves democracies with a problem. Governments are supposed to set the rules of the road. But the tech companies they are meant to regulate are on a different scale, planting their feet in different countries. When Sunak convened the Bletchley Park summit, it was notable that he turned interviewer to quiz Elon Musk, sitting starry-eyed on stage as Musk dominated the discourse.\n\nIt’s time to recognise these companies are acting like political actors. That means it’s time to treat them like political actors, too. We need more transparency: governments signing up to OpenAI for Countries agreements should publish the details of their partnerships by default. We should also ask more questions about infrastructure dependence. Governments love Stargate-style investments in their countries, and want to be able to don a hard hat, cut a ribbon and issue a press release. But if they are in effect a new layer of national backbone, they should be studied more closely – as if they are utilities, rather than receive the good grace of a startup-style mystique.\n\nThe more tech companies start to act like politicians and global leaders, the more we need to treat them like it. That doesn’t mean deference; it means more scepticism and journalistic interrogation.\n\nChris Stokel-Walker is the author of TikTok Boom: The Inside Story of the World’s Favourite App",

    "fullText": "Erebor Bank, Palmer Luckey's finance startup backed by some of the biggest names in tech, got one step closer to launching after it cleared another key federal hurdle this week.\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. approved Erebor on December 16 with conditions: The bank is subject to a strict capitalization requirement and must have investors ready to provide more funding if called upon.\n\nThe bank still requires final approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. It received preliminary approval from the OCC in October.\n\nTodd Baker, a senior fellow at Columbia University and a consultant to fintech companies who isn't involved with Erebor, said in an email that he would expect Erebor to get approval to open in early 2026.\n\nBaker said in an email that one of the FDIC's requirements — that the bank invoke a capital-call agreement that would require unnamed parties to chip in more cash if certain triggers occur — is \"highly unusual\" but \"entirely appropriate given the expectation that the bank will be taking on significant risks associated with its tech and crypto-focused business plan.\"\n\nA lawyer listed in regulatory documents as an Erebor spokesperson didn't reply to a comment request.\n\nWith funding from Joe Lonsdale and Peter Thiel, Erebor's valuation was reported to be about $2 billion earlier this year. Regulatory documents showed that the bank has brought on talent from both Luckey's tech circles as well as bank and bank-regulatory circles; earlier this month, a cryptocurrency event featured remarks by Erebor's Suzanne Dannheim, a former Goldman Sachs employee.\n\nErebor's founding team set out an ambitious timeline in its pitch to investors. The bank stressed founder Palmer Luckey's \"political network\" — he has contributed large sums to President Donald Trump and other Republican organizations — as a key asset.\n\nWith this recent round of regulatory approval, it may come close to meeting its proposed timeline.\n\nThe FDIC approval process kicked off on July 28, which means it received a green light in roughly 5 months. The median application processed last year took over eight months.\n\nSeveral other new bank applications emphasizing digital services are pending with the OCC and other regulators.\n\nMichele Alt, a bank-licensing consultant, said Erebor's quick turnaround at the FDIC is cause for celebration.\n\n\"The prior average was indicative of an unnecessarily slow-moving process and highly risk averse bureaucracy,\" she said in an email to Business Insider. \"I'm delighted to see more efficient processing of bank charter applications.\"",
