    "description": "Yoni Assia, CEO of eToro, predicts AI stocks and crypto will rebound in 2026, while monetary policy later this year will be supportive of risk assets.",
    "fullText": "Anxiety has been high among investors and consumers lately amid a cocktail of macroeconomic and market pressures, but Yoni Assia, the founder and CEO of trading platform eToro, isn't worried.\n\nLeading tech stocks have struggled year to date amid fears of AI disruption across a wide range of industries, while bearish sentiment has pressured crypto prices lower. Assia told Business Insider, though, that he believes both markets will rebound in 2026 and that he remains optimistic about monetary policy shifts.\n\neToro competes in a crowded field of retail-oriented trading platforms, but Assia thinks the platform has carved out a niche for itself among retail traders who utilize its more advanced features. According to Assia, its users haven't shied away from trading recently but have seized the opportunity to buy the dip on discounted tech stocks.\n\n\"I definitely think that it's a bit blown up a bit in proportion,\" he said, \"I think right now, people are a bit excited about the AI correction. I think that's going to pass.\"\n\nAssia added that he's seen traders rotate away from crypto and into precious metals recently. He's not surprised by this, as gold and silver prices have stabilized while crypto continues to fall. Yet, Assia is optimistic that crypto is poised for a comeback from its brutal bear market later this year.\n\n\"After a correction, after all-time high post-halving, you get a bull run, then you have a correction, and then it basically resets three to six months after that correction,\" he said.\n\nThis view is similar to that of other crypto pros who have speculated that if historic market cycles are any guide, crypto prices are due to rebound soon.\n\nAnother factor that has weighed heavily on the minds of some investors is monetary policy shifts that may be coming as a result of Kevin Warsh's appointment to the Federal Reserve. But Assia noted that if the new Fed chair proceeds with the expected rate cuts, it will likely help spur growth for the broader market.\n\n\"Historically, as rate cuts go lower, trading volumes go higher and leverage goes higher in the industry in general,\" he stated. \"The cost of borrowing money goes down, and the ability to more easily leverage goes up, which elevates stocks in the long run.\"",

    "description": "The company said it will focus on building data centers for high-performance computing and artificial-intelligence workloads.",
    "fullText": "Bitfarms (BITF) is moving its legal base from Canada to the United States and will rebrand as Keel Infrastructure as part of its pivot from bitcoin mining BTC$67,801.44 to data center development for high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) workloads.\n\nThe redomiciling process, announced in a Friday press release, will be subject to shareholder, regulatory and court approvals. A shareholder vote is scheduled for March 20, and if approved, the company expects the transition to close by April 1. The new parent company, to be incorporated in Delaware, will trade on the Nasdaq and Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol KEEL.\n\nBitfarms' stock rose 18% following the news, erasing Thursday's 16% tumble as AI infrastructure and crypto stocks sold off.\n\nThe rebrand and relocation follow a year-long strategic review by Bitfarms, which assessed market trends and investor sentiment, CEO Ben Gagnon said. The U.S. move will help the company access a broader pool of capital, simplify its corporate structure, and position it more directly in front of institutional investors, he added.\n\n\"We are no longer a Bitcoin company,\" Gagnon said in a statement, \"We are an infrastructure-first owner and developer for HPC/AI data centers across North America.\n\nTo support its new focus, Bitfarms has begun repaying its $300 million credit facility from Macquarie Group, starting with $100 million tied to its Panther Creek site in Pennsylvania. The repayment reduces debt while preserving what the company says is a strong liquidity position — $698 million as of Feb. 5 — comprised largely of cash and bitcoin.\n\nFollowing the move, Bitfarms will maintain its operational sites in Canada and the U.S., but its New York City office will become its sole headquarters.\n\nDubai takes next step to make real estate flips instant in $16 billion tokenization plan\n\nDubai Land Department and Ctrl Alt move to the next phase of real estate tokenization project, enabling the resale of property tokens.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI and Paradigm launched EVMbench, aiming to evaluate AI agents’ ability to detect, patch, and exploit vulnerabilities within Ethereum-based smart contracts that collectively secure over $100 billion in crypto assets. EVMbench is based on 120 vulnerability types found in 40 different security audits (including several from Tempo blockchain) and will include scenarios involving payment-oriented smart contract code related to expected agentic stablecoin transactions.\n\nIntroducing EVMbench—a new benchmark that measures how well AI agents can detect, exploit, and patch high-severity smart contract vulnerabilities. https://t.co/op5zufgAGH\n\nEVMbench measures each artificial intelligence (AI) agent’s performance in three ways:\n\nEach test is conducted by using an Anvil-based, Rust-language harness to provide a deterministic and reproducible means of evaluating agents within isolated environments rather than live networks.\n\nAI’s Frontier models (the most recent ones) have performed significantly better than those measured six months ago. For example, GPT-5.3-Codex’s average performance on exploit tasks is 72.2%, while its predecessor model (GPT-5) had only 31.9% on the same exploits. Detect and patch modes remain more challenging to agents as they often stop their audit process after finding the first fault or have difficulties maintaining the perfect functionality of the contract while also removing vulnerabilities.\n\nnew collab from @paradigm and @OpenAI:\n\nevmbench is a benchmark and agent harness for exploiting smart contract bugs\n\na few months ago, the best models found <20% of critical, fund-draining @Code4rena bugs in our benchmark. today they find > 70% https://t.co/soOrCR38eO pic.twitter.com/2lr0WUVo2Q\n\nEVMbench tackles both sides of AI use in cybersecurity: monitoring new threats while encouraging defensive applications. As part of this initiative, OpenAI recently committed $10M of Application Programming Interface (API) credits through its Cybersecurity Grant Program to help boost efforts toward creating more defensive research and expanding Aardvark’s (its open-source security research agent) footprint with a private beta test.",

    "fullText": "Real estate and crypto entrepreneur Eric Trump said on Thursday that the crypto world is going to be the future of mainstream finance despite the rout of recent months.\n\nDuring a wide-ranging interview with Yahoo Finance, Trump weighed in on bitcoin, crypto legislation, his personal debanking experience, and the latest digital asset project between the Trump Organization and his flagship crypto venture, World Liberty Financial.\n\nWhat is World Liberty Financial's tokenization project about?\n\nWhat's causing delays in crypto legislation like Clarity Act?\n\nHow has the Trump family's crypto empire evolved?\n\nWhy is Eric Trump suing major banks?\n\n\"First of all, markets aren't always rational,\" Trump said while speaking from Palm Beach, Fla., pointing to bitcoin's performance over the past 10 years, when it was below $500 per coin.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) fell Thursday below $67,000, putting it on pace for its fifth straight week of decline. Its price has nearly halved since reaching an all-time high last October and is down 31% over the past year.\n\n\"If you don't have the backbone, the wherewithal to weather volatility, go invest in some boring bond that's going to yield you 4.5% and call it a day,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump's comments came on the heels of World Liberty Financial pushing into a less volatile side of the crypto world: tokenization.\n\nIn partnership with crypto firm Securitize and a London stock exchange-listed subsidiary of major Saudi Arabian real estate developer DarGlobal, World Liberty is putting real estate assets linked to a Trump resort project in the Maldives, set for completion in 2030, on the blockchain.\n\nThe effort involves packaging revenue interests from loans tied to the real estate project so they can be sold as crypto securities to wealthy investors via crypto exchanges. Tokenization is the process of creating a crypto-world representation of an asset so that its likeness can be traded on crypto rails.\n\nThe tokenized real estate market stands at roughly $359 million, according to crypto data platform RWA.\n\nTokenization is \"going to change the way money flows around the world,\" Trump said, adding that he expects more of everything from debt and commodities to Hollywood film rights, fine art, and potentially even ownership in five-star restaurants to eventually go on blockchains.\n\n\"We're very excited to be on the forefront of that with real estate,\" he added.\n\nThe Trump family's crypto ventures have ballooned since Donald Trump embraced the crypto world while campaigning in 2024. His household's tied digital asset empire now sprawls into most corners of the crypto space.\n\nBut World Liberty has by far caught the most attention. In March 2025, the company launched USD1 (USD136148-USD), a US dollar-pegged stablecoin that is now the world's fifth largest after swelling to $5 billion in total market value.",

    "fullText": "World Liberty Financial, the crypto firm cofounded and partly run by the Trump family, will tokenize loan revenue interest from a new Trump International Hotel and Resort in the Maldives.\n\nTokenization is the process of putting an asset on the blockchain to turn it into a crypto token that can be easily traded, in this case, a loan used to fund the construction of a hotel. Investors who buy tokenized pieces of the loan will be entitled to a portion of the interest payments made on it.\n\nAccording to WLF documents, DT Marks DEFI LLC, which is owned by the Trump family, reserves the right to receive 75% of the revenue generated from $WFLI token sales after expenses.\n\nThe offering won't be available to everyone. Only accredited investors, or those with at least $1 million in liquid assets and who make enough money per year, will be given access to the tokenized loan. The tokens will be offered in partnership with Securitize, Inc. and Dar Global PLC.\n\nThe Trump hotel in the Maldives is set to open in 2030 and was announced in late 2025.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is listed as \"Cofounder Emeritus\" of World Liberty Financial on its website. His three sons — Don Jr., Eric, and Baron — are listed as cofounders, as is Steve Witkoff, who is currently serving as United States special envoy to the Middle East.\n\nWorld Liberty Financial's new tokenization offering is the Trump family's latest move in the crypto space. In January 2025, Trump launched $Trump coin, a meme token that spiked to $45 shortly after launch, and currently trades at $3.40. According to Reuters, the coin made almost $100 million in fees in the first couple weeks after its launch.\n\nWLF also sold a 49% stake in January 2025 to an Emirati royal for $500 million, the Wall Street Journal reported. The firm launched a stablecoin, USD1, last March.\n\nIn addition, Trump Media and Technology Group adopted a crypto treasury strategy last year, buying billions of dollars in bitcoin. According to a Bloomberg report, crypto had boosted the Trump family's net worth by $1.4 billion as of January 2026.\n\nThe token offering from WLF comes as crypto assets endure a brutal bear market as funds flee the space. Bitcoin's price is down 45% from October's high, while ethereum has fallen 59% since August.",

In 2024, he said he believed bitcoin is a speculative asset without a real use case. More recently, he downplayed the potential threat that some think it poses to the US dollar, making it clear that he wasn't concerned.\n\nSolomon didn't reveal exactly how much he has invested in bitcoin or how long he has held it for, only that he holds a \"very, very limited\" amount. He added that he doesn't see himself as a forecaster but rather as an observer of crypto, implying that he believes it is important to understand it as the technology continues to intersect with finance.\n\nGoldman has warmed to cyrpto more recently. Solomon previously stated that the bank has a team assessing how to implement stablecoins. Yet, it hasn't embraced crypto as much as peers like JPMorgan, which has debuted tokenized offerings for clients and issued its own JPM Coin.\n\nIn his address at the World Liberty Forum, Solomon also discussed regulation, noting that he sees the regulatory approach of the last few years as burdensome.\n\n\"When you burden this system with excessive regulation, you start to extract capital,\" he said. \"That absolutely happened in the last five years.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has prioritized easing regulations on the crypto industry, which initially spurred growth for bitcoin and other digital assets. However, the top crypto has been in a rut since hitting an all-time high last October, with prices down nearly 50% since then.\n\nBitcoin was down on Wednesday, struggling to gain momentum after its latest streak of declines.

    "fullText": "One of Wall Street's biggest crypto skeptics is taking fresh aim at bitcoin amid its steep sell-off.\n\nNouriel Roubini — also known as \"Dr. Doom\" for his frequently apocalyptic predictions on markets and the economy — doubled down on his view that bitcoin is far from being an inflation hedge and is a \"pseudo-asset class.\"\n\nBitcoin, which entered bear market territory late last year, traded around $67,400 on Wednesday, down 45% from its peak in late October.\n\n\"Calling Bitcoin or any other crypto vehicle a 'currency' has always been bogus. It is neither a unit of account, a scalable means of payment, nor a stable store of value,\" Roubini wrote in an op-ed for Project Syndicate earlier this month.\n\nRoubini, who has blasted bitcoin in the past as a \"Ponzi Game\" associated with criminal activity and said he believed the token was in \"the mother of all bubbles,\" pointed to the crypto's potential use in illegal transactions. He also said that crypto broadly poses a risk to the financial system as lawmakers integrate it further into traditional banking.\n\nIn particular, he highlighted the GENIUS Act, and said the landmark stablecoin bill should be remembered as the \"Reckless Idiot Act,\" partly because the bill specifies that stablecoins do not have lender-of-last resort or deposit insurance benefits.\n\nThe push among some players in the crypto industry to allow interest payments on stablecoins could further \"undermine the foundations of the banking system,\" he added.\n\n\"Thus, all it would take to incite a panic and trigger a bank run is for a few bad apples in pseudo-libertarian US states to mis-invest their holdings or place their deposits in weak institutions,\" Roubini speculated. \"This is a political and financial stability issue, and few are as serious or as sensitive,\" he later added.\n\nBitcoin's pronounced sell-off has slashed the token's value nearly in half.

    "description": "Bitcoin has the potential to double in value this year. Here's why.",
    "fullText": "With Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) currently trading for less than $70,000, it might seem inconceivable that it could more than double in value to hit a price of $150,000 this year. Yet, that's exactly what some top Wall Street firms are now predicting.\n\nSo what are some of the catalysts that could send Bitcoin soaring this year? Let's take a closer look.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nRight now, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is sitting near all-time lows. It currently reads 13 out of a possible 100, indicating extreme fear.\n\nYou can interpret that ultra-low reading in one of two ways. It could be a clear red flag that something is deeply wrong with Bitcoin. Or, if you're an eternal optimist, it could be a sign of total investor capitulation. It can't get any worse than it is right now.\n\nFrom my perspective, there are a number of factors that could result in a positive shift in market sentiment. Any signal of further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve could trigger a new risk-on mentality, leading to an inflow of new money into crypto and Bitcoin. The passage of new pending crypto legislation later this year, too, could help to reverse the tide on market sentiment.\n\nAnother way to think about the current Bitcoin situation is in terms of money on the sidelines. In other words, there's money just waiting to flow into Bitcoin, but investors are hesitant to do so right now given the terrible market sentiment. After all, Bitcoin is down more than 20% to start the year.\n\nOne way to quantify this is by looking at how much money is currently sitting in stablecoins, which are essentially digital dollars. In a risk-off environment, money flows into stablecoins for safekeeping. In a risk-on environment, money flows out of stablecoins and into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe metric that many investors are focused on right now compares the market cap of Tether (CRYPTO: USDT), the world's largest stablecoin, to the total market cap of the crypto market. If this metric is in the 8% to 10% range, then money is waiting patiently, ready to be deployed. Right now, the ratio sits at 8%. That leads me to think that money is being held back and is set to flow into Bitcoin.\n\nAnother factor that could send Bitcoin higher is a higher allocation to crypto from institutional investors. Historically, their allocation to crypto has been minimal, given the perceived riskiness of the crypto asset class.",

    "fullText": "As Gavin Newsom departs, ultra-wealthy flex wealth and influence to fight regulation and keep the boom going\n\nTech billionaires are leveraging tens of millions of dollars to influence California politics in a marked uptick from their previous participation in affairs at the state capitol. Behemoths such as Google and Meta are getting involved in campaigns for November’s elections, as are venture capitalists, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs and Palantir’s co-founders. The industry’s goals run the gamut – from fighting a billionaire tax to supporting a techie gubernatorial candidate to firing up new, influential super political action committees (Pacs).\n\nThe phenomenon squarely fits the moment for the state’s politics – with 2026 being the year that Politico has dubbed “the big tech flex”.\n\nGavin Newsom, California’s tech-friendly governor who’s been quick to veto legislation that cramps the sector’s unfettered growth, is reaching his term limit. That means Silicon Valley needs to find a new ally. The industry may have found its candidate in an upstart mayor from San Jose, Matt Mahan.\n\nSilicon Valley’s businesses and billionaires – some of the richest and most powerful on earth, most of which are headquartered in California – are in the midst of a massive AI boom. Industry insiders say tech companies need to ensure they can continue to flourish without regulations getting in the way.\n\n“This is a golden opportunity and a golden moment for tech to reset its priorities and its perceptions,” said David McCuan, a political science professor at Sonoma State University who studies state lobbying.\n\nRather than going all-in on one candidate or issue, McCuan said the tech sector is using a multi-pronged attack in California. Tech billionaires are contributing to campaigns ranging from candidates for governor to local city council and school board races. They are also donating heavily to groups campaigning for relaxed taxation and minimal regulation around AI.\n\n“If you’re an uber-zillionaire, you give money early and often,” McCuan said. “They have more wealth and resources than they’ve ever had before, so that allows them to play on both sides of the aisle and up and down the ballot and across issues like never before.”\n\nUnlike other industries, such as oil and pharma, tech has been relatively tame when it comes to lobbying in the state. The industry has tended to focus on narrow state issues and instead spent big and broad at the federal level (aside from Uber and Lyft’s massive $200m ballot measure campaign in 2020). That ethos has changed. California is now ground zero for tech titans working to become omnipresent in politics.\n\nRobert Singleton, the senior director of policy in California for the tech industry group Chamber of Progress, said this moment has been brewing for a long time and it just needed the right thing to set it off.\n\n“The introduction of that billionaire tax obviously galvanized a lot of wealthy individuals who don’t want to see that happen, and who will spend money to make sure it doesn’t happen,” Singleton said. “That tipped them into wanting to get more involved.”\n\nThe “California Billionaire Tax Act”, often referred to simply as the billionaire tax, is a proposal that would require any California resident worth more than $1bn to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state. It’s sponsored by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, and if it receives enough signatures from California voters, it will go to the ballot in November.\n\nWhen the proposal was put forward at the end of last year, many among tech’s billionaire elite threw a tantrum.\n\nSome opened offices or bought mansions in Florida or Texas, vowing to leave California for good. The fleeing rich included Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel, whose current net worth is $25bn; Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth around $255bn and $240bn respectively; and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, whose net worth is not publicly known. Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, worth $229bn, has also bought a property in south Florida valued between $150 and $200m.\n\nThiel has additionally led the charge in donating to a lobbying group, the California Business Roundtable, which has pledged to fight the wealth tax. The Palantir co-founder handed over $3m to the political action committee in late December. Other major donors include realtors, entrepreneurs and private equity firms. James Siminoff, who founded the camera-embedded Ring doorbell company, also donated $100,000, according to public records.\n\n“The most powerful money in politics is to be on the no-side of a ballot measure,” said McCuan. “You can even pre-empt something getting to the ballot, like a billionaire’s tax, by explaining to everyone out there that this is a bad idea for economic growth.”\n\nTech investors and venture capitalists have been extremely vocal in their opposition to the tax, saying that the state will lose revenue as billionaires flee and it will hurt the state’s ability to be economically competitive.\n\nJust this week, Chamath Palihapitiya, a former Facebook executive and current venture capital investor, wrote “the loss of this tax revenue was totally avoidable but is now forever”. Balaji Srinivasan, an investor and former chief technology officer of Coinbase, wrote, “the most successful tech founders of all time have now exited the failed state of California”.\n\nAdding on, Paul Graham, the co-founder of seed capital firm Y Combinator, wrote: “It’s important that people like Zuck and Larry Page are willing to move in response to the proposed wealth tax. It shows politicians what will happen if they try things like this.”\n\nJoining the billionaires, Newsom has pledged to fight the tax, saying it will “drive a race to the bottom” and stifle innovation as the ultra-wealthy leave. “This will be defeated – there’s no question in my mind,” Newsom told the New York Times in January. “I’ll do what I have to do to protect the state.”\n\nOutcry over taxes is just one of the ways the tech sector is ramping up its influence campaign. Several Super Pacs have popped up over the past few months and tech is injecting these committees with tens of millions.\n\nMcCuan said this strategy is helpful for the ultra-wealthy because it allows them to stay behind the scenes, while donating limitless money.\n\n“You could create some amorphous sounding organization like ‘Californians for All That is Good and Right Under the Sun’,” McCuan said. “And who knows what the hell that is, but that entity becomes the vehicle to which others give money … and it becomes very difficult to unpeel and unfurl what is going on.”\n\nMeta launched two new Super Pacs last fall, which are focused on dialing back AI regulation and supporting AI-friendly candidates. The company contributed $45m to one, the American Technology Excellence Project, which will operate in several states but hasn’t yet established a committee in California. The other, Mobilizing Economic Transformation Across (Meta) California, is state-specific and has received one $20m contribution from Meta.\n\nThe social media giant has also matched Google in infusing a separate Super Pac called California Leads with a total of $10m. Ron Conway, a longtime Democratic tech donor, has also donated $100,000 to this committee, which says it aims to support favorable candidates in the state but will not just focus on issues affecting the tech industry, according to Politico.\n\nThe crypto industry is getting into Super Pacs too, debuting a group called Grow California. The committee opened with $10m from crypto executive Chris Larsen and evangelist Tim Draper. Larsen told the New York Times he plans to give $30m more. The focus of Grow California is to “rebuild a state capital” and shape the state’s legislature.\n\n“We have a group of people who are not acting in a pragmatic way. They’re not looking for balance. They’re completely fucking owned by one side,” Larsen, who’s the chair of crypto company Ripple, told Politico. “So we’re going to work on taking out those people who are not working for the people of California.”\n\nWhile the tech industry is now pushing its influence at the state level, San Francisco has already experienced many of these same tactics at the city level. Backed with Silicon Valley money, several different 501(c)(4) groups formed over the past couple election cycles to throw support behind preferred mayoral and board of supervisor candidates. They also bankrolled successful recall campaigns for a progressive district attorney and members of the school board.\n\nThe California governor’s race has been a crowded field without notable frontrunners. Newsom had been a long-time friend of the tech industry, hosting Google’s Page and Brin as guests at his wedding and referring to Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff as “family”. His departure appears to have Silicon Valley fretting.\n\nSingleton, from the Chamber of Progress, said Newsom had long recognized “how pivotal the technology industry is in California”.\n\nBut then, late last month, Mahan, a moderate Democrat and the mayor of San Jose, announced his candidacy. Before Mahan got involved in politics in 2020, he had a career in the tech sector. He was an undergraduate at Harvard with Zuckerberg, and in 2014 co-founded a startup with funding from Conway, Benioff and Napster co-founder Sean Parker.\n\nMahan appears to be the savior the tech industry had been searching for. Since his candidacy announcement just two weeks ago, millions have poured into his campaign. According to public records, he’s received donations from several venture capitalists, along with Roblox CEO David Baszucki, Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan, GitHub co-founder Chris Wanstrath, Cloudkitchen co-founder Diego Berdakin, and Ring founder Siminoff.\n\nMahan has even courted donors who helped launch companies known for working with the Trump administration, including Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale and Anduril co-founder Matt Grimm and his wife Kimberly Grimm, according to public records.\n\nGoogle’s Brin has also backed Mahan, maxing out the limit for an individual campaign donation at $78,400. Several of Mahan’s other tech backers also maxed out their donations. At this point, Mahan has now raised more than double the two most prominent democrats in the race, Eric Swalwell and Katie Porter.\n\nAs political races and ballot measure campaigns continue to heat up across California in 2026, tech’s influence is only expected to grow.\n\n“It’s going to be a fun session,” Singleton said. That’s for sure.”",

    "fullText": "A new variation of the fake recruiter campaign from North Korean threat actors is targeting JavaScript and Python developers with cryptocurrency-related tasks.\n\nThe activity has been ongoing since at least May 2025 and is characterized by modularity, which allows the threat actor to quickly resume it in case of partial compromise.\n\nThe bad actor relies on packages published on the npm and PyPi registries that act as downloaders for a remote access trojan (RAT). In total, researchers found 192 malicious packages related to this campaign, which they dubbed 'Graphalgo'.\n\nResearchers at software supply-chain security company ReversingLabs say that the threat actor creates fake companies in the blockchain and crypto-trading sectors and publishes job offerings on various platforms, like LinkedIn, Facebook, and Reddit.\n\nDevelopers applying for the job are required to show their skills by running, debugging, and improving a given project. However, the attacker's purpose is to make the applicant run the code.\n\nThis action would cause a malicious dependency from a legitimate repository to be installed and executed.\n\n\"It is easy to create such job task repositories. Threat actors simply need to take a legitimate bare-bone project and fix it up with a malicious dependency and it is ready to be served to targets,\" the researchers say.\n\nTo hide the malicious nature of the dependencies, the hackers host the dependencies on legitimate platforms, like npm and PyPi.\n\nIn one case highlighted in the ReversingLabs report, a package named ‘bigmathutils,’ with 10,000 downloads, was benign until it reached version 1.1.0, which introduced malicious payloads. Shortly after, the threat actor removed the package, marking it as deprecated, likely to conceal the activity.\n\nThe Graphalgo name of the campaign is derived from packages that have “graph” in their name. They typically impersonate legitimate, popular libraries like graphlib, the researchers say.\n\nHowever, from December 2025 onward, the North Korean actor shifted to packages with “big” in their name. However, ReversingLabs has not discovered the recruiting part, or the campaign frontend, related to them.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the actor uses Github Organizations, which are shared accounts for collaboration across multiple projects. They say that the GitHub repositories are clean, and malicious code is introduced indirectly via dependencies hosted on npm and PyPI, which are the Graphalgo packages.\n\nVictims running the project as instructed in the interview infect their systems with these packages, which install a RAT payload on their machines.\n\nIt is worth noting that ReversingLabs researchers identified several developers that fell for the trick and contacted them \n\nThe RAT can list the running processes on the host, execute arbitrary commands per instructions from the command-and-control (C2) server, and exfiltrate files or drop additional payloads.\n\nThe RAT checks whether the MetaMask cryptocurrency extension is installed on the victim’s browser, a clear indication of its money-stealing goals.\n\nIts C2 communication is token-protected to lock out unauthorized observers, a common tactic for North Korean hackers.\n\nReversingLabs has found multiple variants written in JavaScript, Python, and VBS, showing an intention to cover all possible targets.\n\nThe researchers’ attribute the Graphalgo fake recruiter campaign to the Lazarus group with medium-to-high confidence. The conclusion is based on the approach, the use of coding tests as an infection vector, and the cryptocurrency-focused targeting, all of which aligning with previous activity associated with the North Korean threat actor.\n\nAlso, the researchers note the delayed activation of malicious code in the packages, consistent with Lazarus' patience displayed in other attacks. Finally, the Git commits show the GMT +9 time zone, matching North Korea time.\n\nThe complete indicators of compromise (IoCs) are available in the original report. Developers who installed the malicious packages at any point should rotate all tokens and account passwords and reinstall their OS.\n\nModern IT infrastructure moves faster than manual workflows can handle.\n\nIn this new Tines guide, learn how your team can reduce hidden manual delays, improve reliability through automated response, and build and scale intelligent workflows on top of tools you already use.",

    "fullText": "Where in New New York City can you see cowboys in snakeskin boots rubbing elbows with Patagonia hedge-fund vest bros?\n\nThe answer is Bitcoin Investors Week in NYC, the multi-day bitcoin bonanza hosted by tech entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano. This year's event kicked off in the depths of a bitcoin bear market, but the exuberance—irrational or otherwise—was on full display throughout the halls.\n\nAn abundance of bitcoin-orange ties and a jubilant mood were the vibes of the whole event.\n\nChris Klein, COO of crypto retirement platform Bitcoin IRA, insisted that the crypto community isn't worried about the current market downturn.\n\n\"Every eighteen months we go through something like this, so if anybody's been in this space long enough, this is the third or fourth time they've been through this,\" he said. \n\nSam Callahan, director of bitcoin strategy and research at digital asset treasury OranjeBTC, echoed the sentiment, saying that seasoned crypto investors remember bear markets much worse than the current decline.\n\nThe bitcoin bear market has dragged on for about four months now, with prices down as much as 50% from the peak earlier this month. They've recovered slightly but are stuck around $70,000, with no clear catalyst on the horizon. Still, for retail and institutional investors, the deep freeze doesn't appear to be souring the mood.\n\nMike Novogratz, CEO of digital asset investment firm Galaxy Digital, revealed that he's been buying more bitcoin recently in anticipation of shifting macro conditions and policy updates.\n\nCathie Wood, founder and CEO of Ark Investment Management, continued to describe bitcoin as a hedge against both inflation and deflation, adding that she thinks blockchain technology is poised to play a role in the next phase of the tech boom.\n\nAnd Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, one of Wall Street's loudest tech bulls, said that he doesn't think anyone can be bullish on tech without being bullish on bitcoin, predicting there will be more use cases for it in the near future.\n\nThe attendees who spoke with Business Insider on the sidelines of the event were equally bullish, donning bitcoin pins on blazer lapels and sporting orange ties in tribute to bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor.\n\n\"These conferences during market drawdowns are refreshing,\" Klint Drici, head of institutional sales at Arch Lending, a crypto-backed loan platform, said. \"They showcase the real builders and operators.\"\n\nIndeed, there were almost as many bitcoin entrepreneurs as investors at the event, boasting about projects they had in the works even as crypto winter deepened.\n\nEran Barak, founder of blockchain consulting firm Breem Group, said that he thinks the macro landscape is shifting in a direction that favors bitcoin, citing regulatory developments on the horizon.\n\n\"As the CLARITY Act moves closer to approval and Fed rate cuts are increasingly expected, funds and enterprises are viewing Bitcoin as a treasury diversification tool—boosting its perceived value as fresh liquidity flows into the market,\" he stated.\n\nMany of the crypto pros at the event didn't quite agree on when bitcoin might rebound, but all maintained that it should stage a comeback this year. Real estate entrepreneur and investor Grant Cardone, who spoke about his bitcoin investing strategy, told Business Insider that he thinks it could move horizontally in the short term before gaining fresh momentum.\n\n\"I think it could go sideways til the Fall or late Summer,\" he said. \"It could touch $40,000, could touch $38,000 and still hit $180,000 before the end of the year.\"",

    "fullText": "History suggests more pain may stil be coming for bitcoin.\n\nIn a note to clients this month, strategists at Ned Davis Research said they saw potential downside ahead for the world's top crypto, even after major selling that's hammered the crypto in recent months. Should its bear market become a full-blown bitcoin winter, the coin could drop to as low as $31,000, according to Pat Tschosik, NDR's chief thematic strategist, and analyst Philippe Mouls.\n\nBitcoin, which has tumbled 44% from its October peak, traded around $69,180 on Friday. Should the coin fall to the $31,000 mark, that implies the crypto falling another 55% from its current levels.\n\nTschosik and Mouls said their analysis of past bitcoin drops had led them to expect a 70%-75% peak-to-trough decline in the crypto should the current sell-off escalate into winter.\n\nAcross bitcoin winters dating back to 2011, bitcoin has dropped an average 84%, NDR said. The average bitcoin winter has also lasted an average of 225 days, Tschosik and Mouls added, though it's only been 129 days since bitcoin peaked in early October.\n\nTschosik and Mouls noted that a winter wasn't necessarily guaranteed, given that bitcoin has more institutional buyers than in the past, which could create greater stability in bitcoin's price.\n\n\"Notice the winters/major bears are getting slightly less severe over time in terms of percent decline and we think that will continue,\" they said of their price forecast.\n\nTalk of more pain for crypto has picked up in recent weeks as bitcoin's decline has steepened. John Blank, the chief strategist at Zacks Investment Research, speculated that the coin could drop to as low as $40,000, given that the average crypto winter lasts for over a year. Stifel predicted last week that the full decline could take it to around $38,000.",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin’s “zero dollar theory” debate has intensified.\n\nIndustry has pushed the AI adoption thesis.\n\nInstitutional exposure continues to rise.\n\nFinancial Times columnist Jemima Kelly has come under fire after arguing that Bitcoin (BTC) has no inherent value, joining a growing chorus of analysts advancing the so-called “zero dollar theory.”\n\nKelly’s remarks, expanded on in a recent CNBC appearance, have prompted intense pushback from Bitcoin advocates and market commentators.\n\nThe dispute comes as major financial institutions continue to build exposure to crypto markets through regulated products such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), even as a growing group of critics insists the underlying assets are ultimately worth nothing.\n\nKelly told CNBC she believed Bitcoin’s value was “zero,” arguing it has no intrinsic worth and that its scarcity narrative is undermined by the unlimited supply of alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins, Kelly said investors must continually accept the idea that Bitcoin is uniquely scarce despite the existence of competing tokens that can replicate or exceed its functionality.\n\nShe said Bitcoin’s market price has been supported in part by influential holders with a vested interest in promoting the asset, pointing to figures such as Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor.\n\nKelly also argued that Bitcoin proponents regularly introduce new narratives to sustain interest, citing claims that emerging technologies such as AI could drive fresh adoption.\n\n“I heard Anthony Pompliano on CNBC yesterday claiming that now all the AI agents are going to be using Bitcoin in crypto,” she said.\n\nPompliano, on Feb. 9, told CNBC that “both Bitcoin and stablecoins” were going to be the money “for all of these AI agents.”\n\nOther industry executives have echoed that view.\n\nCrypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek recently underscored the convergence of crypto and artificial intelligence with the $70 million purchase of the ai.com domain — one of the largest domain acquisitions on record.\n\nThe Ai.com platform, unveiled during a Super Bowl LX commercial on Feb. 8, promotes the idea of personal AI agents capable of executing transactions, organizing schedules and trading stocks, with crypto-based settlement embedded in the system.",

But if what you're saying is follows the last model, it's almost like it wouldn't necessarily be a positive catalyst, it might be a negative sort of like that last capitulation catalyst.\n\nYeah. Right. We need Correct. Correct.\n\nWhat are the what what could be that catalyst?\n\nSo, you know, some people thought uh FTX. Uh, maybe there's another similar type of thing out there.\n\nLike there's a blow up waiting in the wings somewhere.\n\nYeah, like, you know, most people have said that the acceleration down really started after October 10th. You know, October 10th there was a flash crash.\n\nAnd we're we've had flash crashes in the traditional markets. I was in the hedge fund business in the old world for 25 years. I saw many flash crashes. They're normal.\n\nAnd in crypto, you've have flash crashes all the time. It used to be, I don't know if you remember but in 2016, 17, 18, Coinbase would go down and people would say, oh, Coinbase is down and you would have a flash crash.\n\nAnd so we had a very severe moment on October 10th that is yet to be sort of resolved. The person who was maybe forced to liquidate, uh or the entity that was forced to liquidate, uh it seems is still, uh, is still liquidating. Maybe there is an entity, maybe there isn't. We don't know, but I think um there has to be sort of a capitulative moment, a moment of realization where people say, oh my goodness,\n\nit's over. And we've already been seeing that, oh Bitcoin's going to zero. Someone asked me the other day at dinner whether Bitcoin was going to zero. Um, so it's sort of unfortunate, but that's sort of the way markets work. And unfortunately with this specific crypto blockchain market, you have a lot of individuals, a lot of retail of non-professional investor.",

    "description": "Bitcoin's struggles are rooted in the wild world of meme coins, with investors fatigued by constant celebrity-backed tokens that quickly plunge, Gerber said.",
    "fullText": "One year into Donald Trump's presidency, bitcoin is worth less than it was before he was elected, and the entire market is in the throes of a crypto winter. According to famed investor Ross Gerber, blame the meme coin ecosystem for the broader decline.\n\nThe CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management thinks the launch of the Trump and Melania coins around the time of the inauguration, followed by a subsequent boom in meme tokens, has left investors fatigued and wary of digital assets.\n\nIn his view, meme coins either endorsed or launched by celebrities are either rug pulls or end up looking like one. In either case, normal investors are left holding the bag while celebrity boosters get rich.\n\nHe pointed to World Liberty Financial Coin and the Melania token, which have both plummeted in price, while the Trump meme coin has also shed about 80% of its value in the last year.\n\n\"People dive in and buy this stuff because they buy into the fraud, basically, and then they get burned, and that money doesn't come back. It's stolen from them.\"\n\nThis is only part of the problem that Gerber sees. When people lose money betting on meme coins, he added, they typically turn their back on crypto and don't come back. He also thinks the Trump administration's looser approach to crypto regulation is making the market less appealing to everyday investors.\n\nHe said it is extremely difficult for bitcoin to rally when investors are being scared away from crypto, as demand rises only when new participants enter the market.\n\nGerber also cited other celebrity-launched cryptos, such as the token launched by former NYC mayor Eric Adams and the $HAWK coin launched by internet personality Haliey Welch, as examples of celebrities meme coins that plummeted shortly after they debuted, while leaving investors holding the bag.\n\nGerber isn't the only one arguing that a growing lack of faith in crypto is compromising bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Economist Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, recently argued that it will be hard for bitcoin to rise again until institutional investors increase their participation.",

    "description": "The bank listed several reasons for their \"unusually high\" price targets.",
    "fullText": "Two bitcoin-mining stocks have big upside potential, Morgan Stanley analysts say, but it's not tied to a bullish outlook for cryptocurrency.\n\nRather, the companies are well-positioned to convert to data centers to help fuel the AI boom, the bank said in a February 8 client note.\n\nTeraWulf and Cipher Mining have 159% and 158% upside, respectively, said Morgan Stanley in a note initiating coverage of the stocks. Both have seen huge surges in their share price over the last 12 months, with TeraWulf rising 245% and Cipher up 183%.\n\nThe bank listed several reasons for their \"unusually high\" price targets, including:\n\nTeraWulf, in particular, \"has a significant history of building power infrastructure, and has a track record of multiple repeat Bitcoin-toDC conversion transactions with customers,\" a team of analysts led by Stephen C. Byrd said. \"In our view, the company has a viable path to significant annual growth in power and data center capacity, and we include this growth potential in both our base and bull cases.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Cipher Mining \"has entered multiple agreements with data center customers, and has assembled a team with significant data center construction experience,\" the analysts said. As of Q2 2025, the firm had no AI power hosting contracts — now, it has 10 and 15 year deals with Google and Amazon, respectively.\n\nFrom June to December 2025, the equity value creation per watt for companies like TeraWulf and Cipher Mining rose from about $7 to $18, signalling strong demand for power.\n\nDespite Morgan Stanley's big upside targets, the bank said there are risks to its outlook. One is that the firms aren't able to execute properly on their conversion to data centers.\n\n\"These data center projects are very large relative to the overall size of the Bitcoin companies, and execution risks could result in project delays and cost overruns,\" the analysts said. \"This, in turn, could result in greater volumes of equity capital to fund these data center projects, which can cause unexpected dilution and financing challenges.\"\n\nAnother is that hyperscalers could start to pull back on AI spending. Investors have grown nervous about AI capex in recent months, as they continue to look for clues about how the hundreds of billions of dollars in annual investments will pay off.\n\n\"We view a slowdown in AI spend as the largest single risk, though the updates from hyperscalers this past week suggest the risk to AI infrastructure capex is to the upside, not to the downside,\" the note said. \"Though the AI infrastructure industry remains under-supplied with power, it is possible that key AI players could moderate their data center capex for any number of reasons.\"",

    "fullText": "Back in May 2025, a widely followed analyst named KillaXBT posted a roadmap on X (formerly Twitter) about Bitcoin price that many traders scrolled past.\n\nThey are paying attention now. That specific BTC price prediction mapped out the cryptocurrency market structure almost perfectly, calling the top above $100,000 and the subsequent breakdown. But here is the catch: the model suggests the pain isn’t over yet.\n\nDISCOVER: Top 20 Crypto to Buy in 2026\n\nIt is rare to see a Bitcoin chart age this well. The prediction, which resurfaced recently, didn’t rely on hype or gut feelings. Instead, the analyst used something called “rotational market mathematics.”\n\nWhile that sounds intimidating, think of it simply as counting swings, like counting how many times a ball bounces before it loses energy and stops.\n\nDISCOVER: Best New Cryptocurrencies to Invest in 2026\n\nKillaXBT identified that Bitcoin’s “internal liquidity cycling” was exhausted at the highs. The chart correctly predicted that once the price fell below the $100,000 level, it wouldn’t just dip; it would enter a prolonged price crash.\n\nThis aligns with what we have seen recently, as Bitcoin broke major levels as a bearish structure tightened, validating the analyst’s foresight months later.\n\nThe resurfaced chart serves as a forward-looking map, and the destination is lower than most of us want to hear.\n\nKillaXBT’s technical analysis currently suggests that Bitcoin is stuck in a “distribution band” around $70,000. In plain English? Big players are likely selling into these small rallies rather than buying for the long haul.\n\nThe model’s final stage points to a capitulation event, a moment where investors quit in frustration, targeting the $50,000 area.\n\nThis mirrors other concerns in the market, where mounting pressure has led to warnings of a Bitcoin crash to $50k from various bearish analysts. The structure indicates that the bounces we are seeing are weak and corrective, lacking the true power needed to reverse the trend.\n\nWith market sentiment hitting extreme lows, often reflected when we see Crypto Fear and Greed at multi-year lows during a crash, the environment is ripe for this kind of final wash-out.\n\nKillaXBT notes that without a “macro base” forming (a solid floor where price stops dropping for a long time), the true bottom likely isn’t in yet.\n\nDISCOVER: Top Solana Meme Coins to Buy in 2026\n\nFollow 99Bitcoins on X For the Latest Market Updates and Subscribe on YouTube For Daily Expert Market Analysis\n\nRead original story This Analyst Nailed Bitcoin Price Top, Now He Is Calling The Bottom by Ahmed Balaha at 99bitcoins.com",

    "fullText": "Cathie Wood said she would favor Bitcoin over gold.\n\nPeter Schiff has fired back at Wood on X.\n\nWood reaffirmed ARK Invest’s long-term Bitcoin thesis.\n\nCathie Wood, chief executive of ARK Invest, said traders should consider shifting from gold into Bitcoin (BTC) — leading to a public pushback from famed gold advocate Peter Schiff.\n\nSpeaking on The Rundown podcast on Feb. 1, Wood argued that precious metals’ current price levels are difficult to justify outside periods of extreme economic stress.\n\n“If I were a betting person, I would make a shift from gold into Bitcoin,” Wood said.\n\nSpeaking on the podcast, Wood noted that gold has historically surged during periods such as the Great Depression and the high-inflation era of the 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nHowever, she emphasized that current conditions do not resemble either of those times.\n\n“Gold is probably ripe for a fall,” Wood said, pointing out that during the Great Depression, the U.S. government devalued the dollar against gold and confiscated private holdings.\n\nWhile she did not offer direct investment advice, Wood said she would personally favor Bitcoin over gold, citing its long-term role as a store of value.\n\nShe added that although stablecoins have assumed some of Bitcoin’s transactional role in emerging markets, she sees that as a temporary trend.\n\n“When people want real savings, they’re going to buy Bitcoin,” she said.\n\nThe comments drew a sharp response from long-time Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff on Sunday.\n\n“Cathie Wood is a fool,” Schiff wrote in a post on X.\n\nAdding: “Most people won’t realize that until they go broke following her advice.”\n\nIn a follow-up post, Schiff added: “You can’t say I’ve never been right. The most bullish Bitcoin promoters have now been wrong for years.”\n\nSchiff has consistently argued that gold remains a superior store of value compared with Bitcoin and other forms of crypto, warning that BTC’s price gains are driven largely by speculation.\n\nDespite the criticism, Wood has repeatedly defended her firm’s Bitcoin thesis and remained bullish on its long-term price growth.\n\nWood reiterated ARK Invest’s long-term bullish outlook for Bitcoin, pointing to the firm’s “bull case” price target of $1.5 million by 2030.\n\n“Digital gold contributes the most to our bear and base cases,” ARK wrote in its Big Ideas 2025 report. “Institutional investment drives our bull case.”\n\nDespite Wood claiming that stablecoins have taken up some of the role “we thought that Bitcoin would play,” she has remained strong on the firm’s long-term target.",

We have $750,000 in a personal brokerage account (I contribute $30,000 annually), $760,000 in a rollover IRA, $210,000 in a Roth 401(k) (plus a $13,000 company match), $150,000 in crypto, $20,000 in an HSA and two rental houses (about $230,000 in equity, plus $600/month in rent proceeds).\n\nWe have about $850,000 in equity in our primary residence and plan to sell in around three years and then buy something all cash somewhere warm. We have money set aside for our kids' college. Other than the primary residence, we have no debt. Can I quit/retire at 51? – Scott\n\nHi Scott, thanks for reading! You've provided a pretty clear picture of your resources, and I think most people with your assets and income sources would be able to comfortably retire at 51. But retirement is a highly specific undertaking. We really need to consider how your assets and income stack up against your individual needs before we can say whether or not you can retire. I'll walk you through how I see things and hopefully leave you with a better feeling of how to do that.\n\nNot sure when you can retire? A financial advisor can help you build a plan and stress-test it. Connect with an advisor for free.\n\nFor a simple illustration, imagine you walk up to me and show me that you can bend down, stretch and maybe even do a vertical jump. That gives me some feel for your physical fitness, right? But then you point to something out of my view and ask, “Can I pick that up?” Pick up what: a coffee mug, a suitcase, a bag of concrete?\n\nWith all of the information about your assets but none about your lifestyle spending needs, that's analogous to the situation we have here. You've given me a clear picture of your assets, but we don't yet have your lifestyle spending needs. What we can do, though, is get you in the ballpark of what I think you'd be capable of supporting. I think this will give you a good idea of where you stand based on your own understanding of your spending needs.\n\nEverything that follows from here can, and should, be tweaked depending on your preferences and details we don't have. However, I think this will get you close enough to make a reasonable estimate of how prepared you are to stop working.\n\n(And if you need additional help planning for retirement, consider working with a financial advisor.)\n\nSmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin bounced off its lows last week, but it's struggling around the $70,000 mark on Monday.\n\nThe token's decline brought it to nearly $60,000 last Thursday, before it snapped back on Friday. However, as other assets like stocks and precious metals continue to mount a solid recovery to start the week, bitcoin is in low gear.\n\nThe crypto had lost 1% around midday, trading at about $70,100.\n\nAs bearish sentiment pressures crypto markets, finance pros have been puzzling over why bitcoin can't shake off the doldrums.\n\nEconomist Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, said in an interview on CNBC on Monday that he thinks the current bitcoin meltdown is likely to persist until something changes with the investor base.\n\n\"I think the fundamental theme for bitcoin is continued slow institutional adoption, and it's going to be volatile until that base of resident investors, not tourist investors, becomes big enough to absorb it,\" he said.\n\n\"Tourist investors\" seems to refer to opportunistic traders with a short-term view of bitcoin, who buy quickly and sell at the first sign of volatility. In El-Erain's view, this has compromised bitcoin's stability as speculative traders have rushed in and out.\n\n\"People really bought into adoption that attracted a ton of speculators, and then you got a shakeout,\" he said, referring to the theme of institutional adoption that helped buoy crypto last year, the largest example of which has been broad participation from spot bitcoin ETFs that hold the token.\n\nCrypto bull Anthony Pompliano told CNBC that a few factors are driving bitcoin's current slump, laying out three reasons he thinks bitcoin is in a rut.\n\nFirst, the tendency for investors to take profits when bitcoin soars above key thresholds is a headwind, he said, citing selling pressure as the crypto decisively broke above $100,000 last year. \n\nSecond, increased financialization of bitcoin is a likely catalyst. Pompliano nodded to the boom in complex trades that allow investors to short, hedge, and generally increase their speculation on bitcoin's price, challenging bitcoin's status as a buy-and-hold investment.\n\nThird, Pompliano argued that the market is pricing in lower inflation, diminishing bitcoin's appeal as \"digital gold\" and a hedge against rising prices. Also, gold is still supported by central banks, while bitcoin is not.\n\n\"When you look at who's buying gold, it's the central banks,\" he said. \"And the central banks are essentially trying to get away from all fiat currency, not just dollars. And so I think that bitcoin is just saying to us, 'hey, look, inflation is not going to be a problem in the next two years.'\"",

    "fullText": "Newly released documents detail convicted sex offender’s early backing of bitcoin and Coinbase\n\nMillions of files related to Jeffrey Epstein have brought to light his ties to the highest echelons of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nDocuments published last week by the US Department of Justice reveal Epstein bankrolled the “principal home and funding source” for bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, during its nascent stages; he also invested $3m in Coinbase in 2014, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, and cut a check that same year to Blockstream, a prominent bitcoin-focused technology firm. Both crypto startups accepted Epstein’s investments in 2014 – six years after his 2008 conviction in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a minor.\n\nDespite murmurings among crypto communities online about the need for a sector-level reckoning around the Epstein files’ revelations, most industry players predict few consequences for crypto companies or the sector writ large. Some see Epstein as a “skeptical investor” who pulled out of his crypto investments prematurely; others go so far as to claim Epstein was attempting to “undermine bitcoin”.\n\nThe crypto companies that secured Epstein’s investment have grown into multibillion-dollar giants, especially Coinbase, which went public on the Nasdaq in 2021, and whose co-founder, Brian Armstrong, has heavily influenced crypto regulation in the United States.\n\nEpstein’s 2014 investment in Coinbase was brokered by the crypto evangelist Brock Pierce, a former child actor and a co-founder of Tether, the world’s largest issuer of stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency whose value is typically pegged to a national currency.\n\nDocuments published by the justice department reveal Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of Coinbase who spearheaded its fundraise, liaised with Pierce about Epstein’s investment in the company and sought to meet with Epstein “if convenient”. Additional filings suggest Epstein sold half of his shares to Pierce’s firm, Blockchain Capital, for $15m in 2018.\n\nA spokeswoman for Coinbase declined to comment; Pierce did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nEpstein’s financing of bitcoin’s development stemmed from his role as a donor to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Over the course of 20 years, MIT accepted more than $800,000 from Epstein, who also facilitated more than $7m in donations from other wealthy individuals.\n\nIn communications from 2015 between Joichi Ito, then director of MIT’s Media Lab, a tech-focused research institute, and Epstein, Ito wrote that Epstein’s “gift funds” were used to “underwrite” the launch of the Digital Currency Initiative, an offshoot of the Lab tasked with researching and developing open-source crypto technologies; in the same email thread, Ito explained that the Lab’s role was to serve as the “principal home and funding source” for bitcoin. The Digital Currency Initiative did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn 2014, Ito brokered Epstein’s investment in Blockstream, which builds bitcoin-focused tech solutions. Epstein made a $500,000 early-stage investment in the company through an investment fund he co-owned with Ito. Email communications reveal Blockstream’s co-founders, Adam Back and Austin Hill, were invited by Epstein to meet in St Thomas, close to Little Saint James, the private island Epstein owned.\n\nOn Twitter, Back claimed that Blockstream understood Epstein to be a “limited partner in Ito’s fund”, which later divested from Blockstream “due to a potential conflict of interest, and other concerns” – meaning that “Blockstream has no direct nor indirect financial connection with Jeffrey Epstein, or his estate”.\n\nIn communications with an Italian investor, Epstein noted that he “like[d]” Back. Hill continued communicating with Epstein into 2017, checking in with his “friend” following a storm in the Caribbean. “Just checking that your Island is OK,” reads the email thread’s subject line. Representatives for Blockstream and Hill did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLuke Dashjr, an early contributor to bitcoin’s development as well as to Blockstream, has called for Adam Back to resign from his role as Blockstream’s CEO over ties to Epstein. In an interview with the Guardian, Dashjr said Epstein’s interest in bitcoin – namely, his “attempts to undermine” bitcoin’s network, early-stage companies, and developers – was a sign that “evil men often seek to destroy what is good”.\n\nCharlotte Fang, the founder of Remilia, which makes NFTs and other crypto-based art, said “only unserious people might care” about Epstein’s investment in bitcoin and Coinbase; in the latter case, “only the financially unsophisticated” would assume that he had “any degree of influence over the direction” of the exchange, as his seven-figure investment was a small part of Coinbase’s fundraise.\n\n“Bitcoin is a decentralized technology that required no funding, and Epstein was evidently a skeptical investor, who got in later than I did, and exited earlier than he should have,” Fang said.\n\n“Generally speaking, retail consumers will not change their habits” around crypto following this recent release of Epstein files, according to Kadan Stadelmann of Komodo, a crypto platform. Investor practices, including their dependence on connections to cut checks, will probably adhere to the status quo, he added. Some competitor crypto exchanges might see new customers who are leaving Coinbase following these new allegations, he hypothesized – as long as these exchanges didn’t take money from “similar unsavory sources”.\n\nAs to why Epstein was so interested in crypto, and in Coinbase specifically? “Epstein might have liked Coinbase’s IPO prospects,” he surmised.\n\nCryptocurrencies’ technological capabilities may have also played a role in Epstein’s interest in the sector, said Antulio Rosales, a professor at York University who studies crypto.\n\n“There’s his possibility of seeing markets without any ethical commitments, and without any pressures of social norms and of the law itself,” he said.",

    "description": "Opinion: After decades in the trenches, this engineer is done with hype cycles",
    "fullText": "Opinion The real opponent of digital sovereignty is \"enterprise IT\" marketing, according to one Red Hat engineer who ranted entertainingly about the repeated waves of bullshit the industry hype cycle emits.\n\nDuring a coffee break at this year's CentOS Connect conference, The Reg FOSS desk paused for a chat with a developer who was surprised but happy to find us there. We won't name them – we're sure that they'd prefer to keep their job rather than enjoy a moment of fame – but we much enjoyed their pithy summary of how IT has faced repeated waves of corporate bullshit for at least 15 years now, and how they keenly and enthusiastically anticipate a large-scale financial collapse bursting the AI bubble.\n\nThis vulture has been working in the tech field for some 38 years now, and the Linux developer we spoke with has been in the business nearly as long. We both agreed that the late 20th century – broadly, the period from the early 1990s onward for a decade or so – had mostly been one of fairly steady improvement. Then, they suggested, roughly following the 2008 credit crunch, we've had some 15 years of bullshit in tech.\n\nThey called out about half a dozen particular instances of what they considered to be bullshit technology. We were too busy laughing sympathetically to whip out a laptop to make notes, but as best as we can recall the sequence, they were:\n\nAdding back some of the rather invective-laden commentary…\n\nContainers: Sure, yes, they work, they are handy for testing. But they aren't a deployment method. You shouldn't need them. Anything that you can run in a container, you can just run on the bare metal, and if you're not competent enough to get – and keep – that working, then you probably aren't competent enough to deploy a container either.\n\nKubernetes: If you don't need containers, then you don't need another vastly more complicated tool to deploy those containers. The chances are, you are not a vast multinational that must be able to withstand ten million potential new customers visiting your site all at once. It won't happen, so you won't lose any of that imaginary business.\n\n(This is sometimes known as the Use One Big Server approach, and in our humble opinion, it has great merit.)\n\nThe cloud: Nebulous by name and by nature. Who thought it was smart to take all your company's important data and hand it to some internet rando – probably the lowest bidder – trusting them to store the crown jewels, keep them safe, and never ever peek at them. If that sounds reasonable to you, maybe you should try selling homeopathy.\n\n(This can be summarized as There Is No Cloud – There's Just Somebody Else's Computer, and was being spelled out in clear language in 2015.)\n\nAnything \"as a service\" – it doesn't matter what: Infrastructure as a service – if you need servers, buy servers, or rent your own private servers. Nobody else will ever care as much about your servers as you will. Platform as a Service – now you don't even get servers, just OS instances. That's even worse. Software as a Service? Now you don't even know what the server is, or where it is, or what it's running; you don't get software, and you don't even know what data you have or how it's stored – you're paying for access to your own stuff.\n\n(The problems with this entire concept arguably go back to Peter Deutsch's Fallacies of Network Computing some 30 years ago.)\n\nThe blockchain, and anything built on the blockchain: the world's slowest and most-distributed database. Cryptocurrencies? Hashcash on the blockchain. NFTs – URL shorteners on the blockchain, only they're longer rather than shorter. Worthless. Web3? Get ripped off, as a service.\n\nWhich brings us round to \"generative AI\" or, as we prefer to term them, large language models, powered by the transformer algorithm. If The Financial Times can explain how it works to a banker in a couple of thousand words and a few minutes, it can't be that complicated or hard to understand, and it isn't. It's predictive text turned up to 11. It can't even count. As Daniel Stenberg, author of curl, caustically observed:\n\nThe \"i\" in \"LLM\" stands for intelligence.\n\n(This vulture laid out some of his case against it when Gentoo and NetBSD banned LLM bot slop in 2024.)\n\nHonestly, we can't fault any of this reasoning. We've looked into the chronological sequence of the waves of marketing drivel, and it's not quite how we expected. Although the earliest mention of Salesforce.com we can find on The Reg is from 2002, when we called it \"relatively new,\" it was founded in 1999. Perhaps the first mass SaaS offering to the general public was Google's Gmail in 2004.\n\nCloud computing in the sense of automatic creation and deployment of VMs arguably dates to Amazon taking Amazon Web Services live in 2002.\n\nWhoever \"Satoshi Nakamoto\" is or was, their paper [PDF] introducing Bitcoin was published in 2008, although it didn't come to The Reg's attention until 2011.\n\n2008 was also the year that the first version of LXC (you can still find version 0.1.0 on the downloads page) was released. Docker debuted in 2013 but your humble correspondent had predicted that Linux containers would be the Next Big Thing a couple of years earlier, back in 2011. We reckon we called it.\n\nKubernetes first appeared in 2014, although Google had been running \"Borg\" internally since around 2008. We still harbor a cynical suspicion that Mountain View threw it over the wall for no other reason than to distract the Penguinisti and keep them busy.\n\nSo in chronological order, those are:\n\n2002: Cloud computing goes mainstream with AWS\n\n2004: SaaS reaches the general public\n\n2008: LXC frees application containers from FreeBSD's Jail and brings them to Linux… and Bitcoin delivers full industrial-scale mass-production of the ancient scam of the pyramid scheme\n\n2014: Kubernetes is loosed upon an all-too-willing tech world\n\n2022: ChatGPT opens to the public, or as The Reg calls it, another AI to fill the world with kinda-true stuff\n\nAll right, yes, rather more than 15 years. \"A century of tech BS\" seems a bit over the top when it's only 2026, but it certainly feels that long.\n\nObviously there are many more potential candidates, but we thought this was an excellent top six. Some of the other contenders are more niche, from the eternally awful Jira to the project managers' religion of Agile. Which of your bêtes noires did we miss? ®",

    "description": "One crypto observer suspects a fund holding Bitcoin call options got wiped out, triggering a broader crash.",
    "fullText": "Crypto prices got absolutely rocked this week with Bitcoin falling nearly $15,000 in 24 hours—a bloodbath not seen since the collapse of crypto conman Sam Bankman-Fried’s empire back in 2022. On Friday, Bitcoin had clawed back most of those losses, and is now trading around $70,000, but the episode has left even longtime crypto insiders asking each other “What just happened?!” There are plenty of theories swirling around, but one is particularly compelling: The cause of the crash lies with Hong Kong traders who placed high-leverage Bitcoin bets that went horribly wrong.\n\nThat theory was put forth on X by Parker White, a former equities trader who is now COO at a crypto firm called DeFi Development Corporation. In a long thread, White said there is evidence pointing to the sudden implosion of Hong Kong hedge funds that held call options in BlackRock’s IBIT, which is the world’s biggest Bitcoin ETF.\n\nWhite suggests that the hedge funds used the Yen carry trade (a form of interest arbitrage) to finance big positions in out-of-the-money IBIT options. This amounted to a risky bet that Bitcoin prices, which have been slumping since a big sell-off in October, would recover. The hoped-for rally didn’t arrive, however. Meanwhile, White speculates that the Hong Kong funds also got pummeled by headwinds in the Yen-carry trade—which made their financing more expensive—and exposure to recent convulsions in the silver market.\n\nThe upshot is the hedge funds faced a perfect storm and, as the crypto market slumped further this week, the value of their holdings declined until they got liquidated—forcing the mass sell-off of IBIT shares and a calamitous fall for Bitcoin. Here is how White explained what happened in trader-speak:\n\nNow, I could easily see how the fund(s) could have been running a levered options trade on IBIT (think way OTM calls = ultra high gamma) with borrowed capital in JPY. Oct 10th could very well have blown a hole in their balance sheet, that they tried to win back by adding leverage waiting for the “obvious” rebound. As that led to increased losses, coupled with increased funding costs in JPY, I could see how the fund(s) would have gotten more desperate and hopped on the Silver trade. When that blew up, things got dire and this last push in BTC finished them off.\n\nIn his post, White also pointed out that the Hong Kong hedge funds, whose Bitcoin trading occurred only in the form of ETF shares, are not part of the traditional crypto ecosystem. This means that chatter about their predicament did not bubble up on “Crypto Twitter”—which is the go-to forum for industry news—and nor did it create counter-parties who incurred big losses, and would be likely to warn others.",

    "description": "“We see few bullish indicators that suggest we may be approaching the bottom,” Jefferies analyst Andrew Moss says.",
    "fullText": "First, the good news. Bitcoin ticked up 5% this morning to $65.9K per coin.\n\nThat’s it. That’s all the good news about Bitcoin today. Everything else is bad news. The original cryptocurrency has lost 50% of its value, peak to trough, falling from a high of about $125K per coin in October 2025 to its low yesterday of $61.3K.\n\nShares in Strategy, Michael Saylor’s “Bitcoin treasury company,” which offers investors exposure to Bitcoin via its stock, fell 17% yesterday and are down 75% from their peak last year. At $65.9K, the price of Bitcoin is now well below the average price Strategy has paid for acquiring its hoard, $76K. The company’s market cap is now billions below the value of the Bitcoin it holds. On its Q4 earnings call yesterday the company said it could cover all its convertible debt even if Bitcoin fell 90% in value, and that it had enough cash to honor its dividends for the next two and a half years.\n\nHow are Bitcoin ETF outflows affecting the market?\n\nWhat impact is whale selling having on Bitcoin?\n\nWhy is Bitcoin experiencing a 50% decline?\n\nWhat are analysts predicting for Bitcoin's future?\n\nThe reason Bitcoin is in decline? The whales are selling up, according to Jefferies analyst Andrew Moss. “Large BTC holders are selling into weakness,” he told clients in a note this morning. “Whales transitioned to net sellers over the weekend after accumulating since early January.” Here’s his chart:\n\nIn addition, retail investors who had bought into Bitcoin via exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offered by traditional finance platforms are also selling. “Spot BTC ETF net outflows during the weeks of Jan. 19 and Jan. 26 marked the second and third largest since inception and were followed by large net outflows on Feb. 4,” he said.\n\n“The all-too-familiar ‘Crypto Winter’ chatter has emerged yet again,” he wrote. “We see few bullish indicators that suggest we may be approaching the bottom,” particularly as there are no signs that small- and medium-size holders are trying to buy the dip, he said.\n\nYesterday’s performance was Bitcoin’s “worst daily decline since November 2022,” Deutsche Bank’s Henry Allen noted this morning. That was the month Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto exchange collapsed, taking with it billions in people’s savings.\n\nAt UBS, Paul Donovan was typically terse: “Crypto is not an asset, and is held by a tiny portion of society. It is unlikely that consumer behavior will change because of recent market moves.”\n\nChevy Cassar, the author of today’s Milk Road email, a respected crypto newsletter, said: “I’ll admit it: This sucks.” And it will get worse, he said: “The market is likely set to continue down, with history telling us that these assets will hit bottom anywhere in the next one to 11 months.”",

    "description": "Strategy, Michael Saylor's iconic bitcoin treasury, has seen its stock plunge and its cost basis for its bitcoin trove soar amid the token's bear market.",
    "fullText": "For a while there, it looked like Michael Saylor's bitcoin-hoarding business software firm had cracked some secret code.\n\nInvestors piled into the stock, forked over more money during the firm's many debt and equity raises over the years, and generally were amenable to Saylor's pitch that piling up ever more bitcoin was a winning strategy.\n\nThat could be a tougher pill to swallow amid the deepening crypto winter of the last few months.\n\nMichael Saylor's iconic bitcoin treasury has tumbled amid the dramatic plunge in the token's price, and the volatility since the October peak is being reflected in earnings.\n\nStrategy reported a $12.4 billion net loss for the fourth quarter of 2025, with its fortunes slipping as bitcoin sank deeper into its bear market.\n\nThe price of bitcoin jumped 7% on Friday after an intense bout of selling earlier in the week, but the token is still down around 46% from its recent peak and is trading below $70,000. That's a key psychological threshold the token recently dipped below for the first time since 2024. Meanwhile, Strategy stock also jumped on Friday as the risk-off rout took a breather and the hardest hit assets rallied, but it's down sharply from recent highs.\n\nStrategy has come under closer scrutiny from investors in recent months amid fears that the firm could be forced to sell some of its bitcoin as prices keep dropping. Late last year, Strategy's CEO, Phong Le, said the firm could sell bitcoin as a \"last resort\" if mNAV, a measure of Strategy's stock price relative to the value of its bitcoin holdings, dropped below one. The ratio stands at around 1.13, according to the latest information on Strategy's website.\n\nStrategy isn't necessarily under financial stress, Nic Puckrin, a digital asset analyst at Coin Bureau, told Business Insider. The crypto treasury has billions in cash reserves, and Strategy has several options to get more cash if needed, though sentiment among its investors is \"obviously rock bottom.\"\n\n\"The crypto sell-off is hitting Strategy hard. There's no denying it,\" Puckrin said.\n\nHere are three charts that show how bitcoin's bear market has affected Strategy.\n\nShares of Strategy are deep in bear-market territory. The stock is down about 70% from its all-time high in July of last year.\n\nAs bitcoin has plunged, Strategy's cost basis—or the average price paid per token—has climbed. Strategy's average cost per bitcoin was $76,052 at the end of the fourth quarter. That's around $9,000 above bitcoin's current price.\n\nThe firm has amassed a trove of 713,502 bitcoin, or around 3% of the crypto's total supply.\n\nStrategy recorded an operating loss of $17.4 billion in the fourth quarter. Prior to that, it recorded operating income of $3.9 billion in the third quarter and $14 billion in the second quarter.\n\nStrategy did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nSaylor, who has touted the value of bitcoin for years, has continued to affirm his confidence in the crypto amid even its sell-off. In recent posts on X, he's told his followers to \"HODL,\" a mispelling of HOLD and sometimes an acronym for \"hold on for dear life,\" and described volatility in bitcoin as \"Satoshi's gift to the faithful.\"\n\nOthers have been far less optimistic amid the crash this week. Michael Burry, the famed investor from \"The Big Short,\" predicted a series of \"sickening scenarios\" in the event that bitcoin's crash continues.\n\nMeanwhile, other forecasters this week have said the sell-off could have much further to go if past bear-market declines are any indicator. Stifel said the plunge could take bitcoin as low as $38,000.",

    "description": "MicroStrategy reveals its extreme Bitcoin downside scenario, outlining when debt pressure, restructuring, or dilution risks emerge.",
    "fullText": "MicroStrategy (Strategy) released its Q4 2025 earnings report and, along with it, disclosed an extreme downside scenario that would begin to strain its Bitcoin treasury model.\n\nThe CEO’s remarks provided rare insight into how far the market could fall before the company’s capital structure comes under serious pressure.\n\nDuring its latest earnings discussion, MicroStrategy CEO Phong Le said that a 90% decline in Bitcoin’s price to roughly $8,000 would mark the point where the firm’s Bitcoin reserves roughly equal its net debt.\n\nAt that level, the company would likely be unable to repay convertible debt using its BTC holdings alone. As a result, it may need to consider restructuring, issuing new equity, or raising additional debt over time.\n\nLeadership emphasized that such a scenario is viewed as highly improbable and would unfold over several years, giving the firm time to respond if markets deteriorated significantly.\n\n“In the extreme downside, if we were to have a 90% decline in Bitcoin price to $8,000, which is pretty hard to imagine, that is the point at which our BTC reserve equals our net debt and we'll not be able to then pay off of our convertibles using our Bitcoin reserve and we'd either look at restructuring, issuing additional equity, issuing an additional debt. And let me remind you: this is over the next five years. Right, So I'm not really worried at this point in time, even with Bitcoin drops,” said Le.\n\nMeanwhile, it is worth noting that Le’s remarks come only months after the Strategy executive admitted a situation that would compell the firm to sell Bitcoin.\n\nAs BeInCrypto reported, Phong Le cited a Bitcoin sale trigger tied to mNAV and liquidity stress.\n\nSpeaking on What Bitcoin Did, CEO Phong Le outlined the precise trigger that would force a Bitcoin sale:\n\nFirst, the company’s stock must trade below 1x mNAV, meaning the market capitalization falls below the value of its Bitcoin holdings.\n\nSecond, MicroStrategy must be unable to raise new capital through equity or debt issuance. This would mean capital markets are closed or too expensive to access.\n\nTherefore, the latest statement does not contradict Phong Le’s earlier position but adds another layer of risk.\n\nPreviously, a Bitcoin sale depended on stock trading below mNAV and capital markets' closing. Now, he clarifies that in an extreme 90% crash, the immediate issue would be debt servicing, likely addressed first through restructuring or new financing—not necessarily selling Bitcoin.",

    "fullText": "Global markets slid hard on Friday as losses spread across tech stocks, cryptocurrencies, and precious metals, reinforcing fears that investors have moved into a \"sell everything\" mindset.\n\nMuch of the pressure is coming from tech, as doubts grow over whether the AI boom that powered recent gains can live up to expectations.\n\n\"A session of pure carnage overnight as the rotational flows noted in yesterday's note — out of tech and into cyclical morphed into a 'sell everything' mentality across stocks, crypto and commodities,\" Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG Australia, wrote on Friday.\n\nIn Asia, South Korea's tech-heavy Kospi plunged and briefly triggered a trading halt after the index dropped 5%.\n\nHeavyweights Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix were among the hardest hit, dragging the market lower as investors rushed to cut exposure to technology stocks.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell as much as 2.1% as China's major tech names moved lower, reflecting weaker risk appetite and ongoing pressure on the sector.\n\nAustralia's ASX 200 also declined, tracking the global selloff, while Japan's Nikkei 225 reversed earlier losses ahead of a general election this week.\n\nCryptocurrencies fell alongside equities, extending a week of heavy losses as investors continued to reduce risk.\n\nBitcoin was trading around $64,500 after falling about 10% over 24 hours.\n\nThe selling also swept through commodities, with silver remaining under intense pressure following last week's violent breakdown.\n\nSpot silver was trading around $71.20 per troy ounce. It had hit a record high above $121 per ounce last week.\n\n\"Silver's attempt to stabilise after last week's historic rout has so far proven short‑lived,\" Ole Hansen, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote in a Thursday note, pointing to renewed selling and technical resistance that triggered reversals.\n\nHansen also pointed to fresh selling from China, including disruption around China's only pure-silver fund after it traded far above its underlying value and was later suspended, leaving investors locked in as it repeatedly hit limit-down moves.\n\nHe added that near-term price action in silver is likely to be driven more by market mechanics and positioning than by macroeconomic headlines, given the extreme volatility still coursing through the market.\n\nThe latest moves underscore how quickly sentiment has shifted across asset classes.\n\n\"Investors are questioning their commitment to the pillars that have underpinned markets over the past six months: AI, crypto, and precious metals. This raises the odds of a deeper unwind,\" wrote Sycamore.",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) dropped to $67,000 per token on Thursday, falling to its lowest level since 2024 as selling pressure intensified.\n\nThe token extended losses from the prior session after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signaled that the US government would not step in to support the cryptocurrency market.\n\nIn a heated back-and-forth during a House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, Bessent was asked if the US Treasury had the authority to buy bitcoin or other cryptos.\n\n\"I do not have the authority to do that, and as chair of FSOC, I do not have that authority,\" Bessent stated.\n\nBitcoin fell to as low as $67,073 apiece early Thursday, continuing Wednesday's slump that followed Bessent's comments.\n\nThe decline was also fueled by the broader selling pressure in markets and a warning from notable investor Michael Burry that a sustained decline in bitcoin's price could \"set in motion a death spiral leading to massive value destruction.\"\n\nWhat are analysts saying about Bitcoin's support levels?\n\nWhy did Bitcoin drop to $67,000 Thursday?\n\nHow has Bitcoin performed year-to-date in 2024?\n\nWhat did Treasury Secretary Bessent say about crypto?\n\n\"Bitcoin has been exposed as a purely speculative asset, and is not near the debasement trade hedge that gold and other precious metals are,\" Burry, who rose to prominence after predicting the 2008 financial crisis, wrote in his Substack.\n\nThe move lower on Thursday only added to bitcoin's recent rout. The world's largest cryptocurrency is down nearly 20% year-to-date.\n\nBitcoin dropped sharply last weekend to notch its fourth straight month of losses.\n\nThe move lower coincided with President Trump's announcement last Friday selecting Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve when Jerome Powell's term ends in May, a nomination markets view as hawkish.\n\nEther (ETH-USD) and other digital tokens also slid.\n\nAfter bitcoin earlier broke through the key support level at $73,000, 10X Research strategists wrote that \"current flows suggest sentiment has shifted meaningfully.\"\n\nThe firm's strategists pointed to flow and positioning data, which indicated \"investors are not yet positioned to buy the dip.\"\n\n\"While sentiment and technical indicators are approaching extreme levels, the broader downtrend remains intact,\" the researchers wrote. \"In the absence of a clear catalyst, there is little urgency to step in.\"\n\nThe firm noted that traders remain focused on deleveraging and unwinding their positions rather than on preparing for a typical snapback rally.\n\nPressure on digital assets reflected the broader fragility across the crypto market. Aside from a brief bounce last month, bitcoin has struggled since October, when whale selling and forced liquidations swept through the industry.",

The largest derivatives liquidation event on record kicked off a sell-off that has yet to find a floor. CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index has since fallen to zero.\n\nThe financial strain on miners has intensified sharply in recent weeks. Daily Bitcoin mining revenue plunged from roughly $45 million to a yearly low of $28 million in late January, driven by a combination of falling prices and severe US winter storms that forced large operators to curtail production.\n\nOutput from the largest publicly traded miners dropped from roughly 77 Bitcoin per day to just 28 over the same period, according to CryptoQuant.\n\nAverage block times have drifted to roughly 11.6 minutes, well above the protocol’s 10-minute target, reflecting the volume of hashpower that has gone offline.\n\nThe Miner Profit and Loss Sustainability Index has slid to 21, confirming that revenues are failing to cover costs for a significant portion of the network. Older models, including the Antminer S19 XP+ and MicroBT M60S, are no longer profitable at current difficulty and standard electricity rates of $0.08 per kilowatt-hour.\n\nEven newer S21-series machines are approaching their shutdown price range of $69,000 to $74,000, as previously reported.\n\nThe next Bitcoin difficulty retarget, projected for February 8, is estimated to cut mining difficulty by approximately 14% to around 121 trillion, down from the current 141.67 trillion.",

    "fullText": "The Royal Government of Bhutan has moved over $22 million in BTC out of sovereign wallets over the past week alone, drawing attention from the crypto community.\n\nOne transaction, 5 days ago, was directly sent to addresses linked to market maker QCP Capital, Arkham data revealed. The moves align with Bhutan’s periodic sales of BTC since it began mining the crypto in 2019.\n\n“From our observations, Bhutan periodically sells BTC in clips of around $50M, with a particularly heavy period of selling around mid-late September 2025,” Arkham wrote.\n\nBesides, the Himalayan Kingdom’s crypto portfolio has gone down more than 70% from its $1.4 billion peak to $412 million, following market depreciation.\n\nPer Bitcoin Treasuries, Bhutan remains the seventh-largest government Bitcoin holder.\n\nBhutan has been mining Bitcoin since 2019 and saw more than $765 million in BTC profit.\n\n“They mined most of their BTC before the halving in 2024, and tapered heavily after that,” said the Arkham report. “This is because the cost to mine a single Bitcoin roughly doubled, which made mining less efficient.”\n\nFurther, the nation seems to have mined 8,200 BTC in 2023 alone, making it the heaviest mining year. It approximately mined 1800 BTC in 2022 and 300 BTC in 2024.\n\nThe BTC transfers from the government wallet in the past week come after Bitcoin has been slumping to $70,000. The largest crypto has tumbled 7.36% over the last 24 hours, outpacing the broader crypto market’s 6.39% fall.\n\nDespite the heavy transfers, blockchain data analysts note that they are more likely to be internal reallocation or custodial arrangements rather than liquidation. The country’s wallet balances remain largely unchanged.\n\nBhutan has made similar mass wallet moves in the past without triggering market crashes.\n\nRead original story Bhutan Quietly Sells Over $22M in Bitcoin, Triggers Speculation Over Possible Sell-Offs by Sujha Sundararajan at Cryptonews.com",

    "fullText": "US stocks took sizable hits again on Thursday in a fruitless search for a reprieve from a building tech sell-off as investors awaited Amazon earnings, assessed Alphabet's big AI spending plans, and digested jobs data that signaled fresh weakness in the labor market.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved roughly 1.2% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost over 1.1%, or more than 500 points.\n\nThe market is in the midst of a full-on tech wipeout, as investors weigh whether some software stocks took too big a beating. The losses have been spurred by worries about AI disruption to established software players — a risk that had been overlooked by investors focused on the fallout from massive AI spending until recently.\n\nWall Street is still digesting the latest batch of corporate earnings, with Big Tech's AI build-out and demand in high focus. Alphabet (GOOG) shares slid, but pared losses, after the Google parent outlined a significant ramp-up in AI investment — to as high as $185 billion — in its quarterly results late Wednesday.\n\nThe countdown is now on to Amazon's (AMZN) report, set for release after Thursday's market close. Eyes are on the all-important AWS cloud unit, expected to deliver a 21% jump in sales.\n\nMeanwhile, the labor market flashed fresh signals of weakness: Weekly jobless claims rose more than expected, and job openings sank to their lowest level since 2020, while a new report found that last month marked the worst January for layoff announcements since 2009. The government's monthly jobs report is due next Wednesday.\n\nElsewhere, silver (SI=F) plunged as much as 17%, erasing all of its two-day recovery as Chinese buyers dumped holdings. Wall Street is debating whether the recent record rally in silver and gold (GC=F) ran too high, too fast — and if a further slump awaits.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) also plunged to its lowest level since 2024, wiping out all of the gains accumulated during President Trump's second term. The token broke below $63,000 — amid a crisis of confidence.\n\nYahoo Finance's Francisco Velasquez reports:\n\nSilver (SI=F) prices tumbled 14% on Thursday to hover above $75 per ounce, erasing gains from the past two days. Gold (GC=F) futures also slipped to $4,900 per ounce after both metals had risen for a second consecutive day following last Friday’s sell-off.\n\nAnalysts warned that silver’s short-term rebound remains volatile, though they remain bullish on bullion prices over the medium term, despite last week’s dramatic pullback that interrupted a blistering rally over the past year.\n\n\"The widening divergence between gold and silver performance reinforces a recurring theme: silver behaves less like a monetary metal during periods of stress and more like a high-beta hybrid, amplifying both optimism and fear,\" Ole Hansen, Saxo Bank's commodity strategy head, wrote on Thursday.\n\n\"History suggests that silver tends to stabilise only once realised volatility falls and speculative positioning is reset — conditions that are not yet fully in place,\" he added.\n\nYahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports:\n\nMortgage rates barely budged this week: The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage edged higher to 6.11% from 6.10%, while the 15-year fixed averaged 5.50% ticked up to 5.5% from 5.49% last week.\n\nYahoo Finance's Hal Bundrick and Laura Grace Tarpley note that the 10-year Treasury note, a pricing indicator for 30-year fixed mortgage rates, has hovered above 4.2% since mid-January. However, the spread between Treasurys and mortgage rates has narrowed recently, and the 30-year has resisted a substantial move higher.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nCheck out frequently asked questions about mortgage rates and our mortgage calculator here.\n\nYahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports:\n\nYahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi writes:\n\nCheck out the top takeaways from Sozzi and Schwab's conversation here.\n\nIt hasn't been a great day for jobs data, with the delayed JOLTS report serving as the final piece in a trifecta of negative news about layoffs, hiring, and unemployment claims.\n\nYahoo Finance's Emma Ockerman reports:\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) tumbled below $64,000 on Thursday, its lowest level since October 2024.\n\nThe token is down nearly 50% from its all-time high last year, erasing all the gains made during President Trump's second term. Investors had been optimistic that the administration's crypto-friendly policies would lift digital-asset prices.\n\n\"Bitcoin remains in a larger bear-market structure,\" read a 10X Research note on Thursday. \"In the absence of a strong catalyst and with positioning still stretched, downside risks remain elevated.\"\n\nNotably, the firm points to a significant overhang — overexposed bitcoin ETF holders who are underwater, with an estimated average acquisition price near $90,000.\n\nA similar dynamic is playing out with ether (ETH), which tumbled 13% on Thursday. Investors holding Ethereum ETFs are down approximately 31% from their average cost basis, according to 10X Research data.\n\n\"Under these conditions, attracting incremental allocations from Wall Street investors becomes increasingly difficult, particularly when many existing holders likely regret not reducing exposure at significantly higher levels,\" the note said.\n\nAbsent a significant catalyst, the firm doesn't see a bottom to crypto's bear market until possibly the summer.\n\n\"As we have previously outlined, a cycle low around the FIFA World Cup this summer could mark a more compelling long-term buying opportunity,\" 10X Research analysts said.\n\nPeloton (PTON) shares fell more than 20% after the company reported its fiscal second quarter earnings and announced its CFO will be exiting.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports:\n\nHims & Hers (HIMS) shares soared as much as 9% as the company said it will begin selling compounded copies of Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Wegovy pill. The pill from Hims & Hers would cost about $100 less than Novo's, Reuters reported.\n\nNovo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (LLY) both saw shares tumble about 7% on the news.\n\nSoftware stocks have been hammered in the past few days, accelerating a months-long decline as investors become more fearful of disruption risks posed by new artificial intelligence tools — particularly those from Anthropic.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai was asked about the market belief that software stocks are losing ground during a call with analysts following the Google parent's earnings report Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe CEO said: \"Look, at least from my vantage point, I definitely see we have very, very good SaaS (software as a service) customers who are leaders in their respective categories.\"\n\nThose customers include Intuit (INTU), ServiceNow (NOW), and Salesforce (CRM), per Bloomberg data.\n\nPichai continued: \"And what I see the successful companies doing is they are definitely incorporating Gemini deeply in critical workflows, be it on improving their product experience and driving growth or using it to drive efficiency within their organizations.\"\n\n\"[J]ust like it has been an enabling tool for us across our products and services.. I think the [software] companies who are seizing the moment, I think, have the same opportunity ahead.\"\n\nHis comments echo those of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang this week.\n\nRead more about what's driving fears over AI eating into the competitive moats of SaaS leaders here.\n\nThe performance of Amazon's (AMZN) cloud business, AWS, will be keenly examined when its earnings report lands later, after Microsoft (MSFT) stock plunged last week, in part due to a slowdown in cloud growth.\n\nThis was not an issue for Amazon’s October earnings, as its shares jumped almost 10% following better than expected revenue from Amazon Web Services, also known as AWS. Now, however, fear is rippling through the tech sector, and Amazon investors are increasingly concerned that the slowdown at Microsoft’s Azure indicates broader weakness for cloud providers.\n\n“It isn’t clear how much of Microsoft’s disappointment might be due to company-specific issues and how much might reflect an overall slowing in the cloud space,” said David Miller, chief investment officer at Catalyst Funds, which holds Amazon shares in several portfolios. “If it’s the latter, that could carry over.”\n\n... Amazon’s results come against a backdrop of anti-software sentiment that’s weighing on the entire tech sector as investors try to sort the winners and losers from the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent to develop artificial intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft’s aggressive AI-related capital expenditures, alongside the slowing Azure growth, invited new questions about when these investments will pay off more substantially.\n\n“It’s really about what’s already priced into the stock, and I think what was starting to price in for [Microsoft] was a higher growth rate, which is always a little dangerous,” said Melissa Otto, head of technology, media and telecommunications research at Visible Alpha. “We haven’t really seen Amazon moving up in the same way.”\n\nAt the market open, US stocks plunged for a third day as a broad sell-off in tech names continued.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way lower, sinking 1.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) shed 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which includes fewer tech stocks, fell 0.5%.\n\nUS weekly applications for unemployment benefits increased by more than expected last week, as snowstorms across much of the country may have led more people to file for assistance.\n\nJobless claims for the week ending Jan. 31 increased by 22,000 to 231,000 claims, exceeding economists' forecasts, the Labor Department reported Thursday.\n\nContinuing claims, a proxy for the total number of people receiving state unemployment benefits, increased to 1.84 million.\n\nDistortions from winter weather notwithstanding, the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits suggests the labor market remains broadly stable if not cooling gradually.\n\nThough in a sign of cracks appearing in the \"low hire, low fire\" trend that has characterized the labor market for over a year, layoffs jumped in January to their highest level for that month in 17 years, according to Challenger data (scroll down for more on this).\n\nYahoo Finance's Emma Ockerman reports:\n\nYahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban reports:\n\nJeff Bezos came, he saw, he conquered.\n\nMaybe not in the way you'd expect from a onetime financial savior of an iconic newspaper. There are now two Bezos eras at the Washington Post: The first started when he rescued it in 2013. The second began when he saw it gutted, blessing mass layoffs the company executed on Wednesday.\n\n... On social media and in news coverage in the aftermath, Post employees, the labor union, and alumni (myself included) strongly criticized the decision.\n\nOthers have pointed to more recent moves by Bezos.\n\nLeading up to the Post's deep cuts, several media observers highlighted Amazon's enormous budget to produce and market the new documentary \"Melania,\" about first lady Melania Trump.\n\nAmazon's extraordinary spending prompted questions about the movie working as a kind of bribe from Bezos to the White House. (Amazon says they licensed the movie because they think people will love it. The film's Rotten Tomatoes scores and box office numbers have inspired a news cycle of their own.)\n\nBut the splashy Melania rollout provided an ugly contrast to the austerity Bezos was serving down to the Post's newsroom. In the worst light, critics said Bezos was willing to burn money to please the president but was now unwilling to do so for journalism in the public interest.\n\nRead more here in the takeaway from today's Morning Brief.\n\nChinese EV maker Nio (NIO) sent its shareholders a profit alert on Thursday morning, letting them know that the company expects to post its first-ever profit in the fourth quarter.\n\nNio said it will see an adjusted profit from operations of 200 million Chinese yuan (approximately $29 million) to 700 million yuan (approximately $100 million).\n\nThe company attributed the profit to sustained sales growth, improved margins from its product mix, and ongoing cost-cutting measures.\n\nNio stock popped 6% in premarket trading.\n\nEstee Lauder (EL) shares slumped 10% before the bell on Thursday, despite beating analysts' estimates on earnings per share and revenue, as tariff woes sent the beauty group's shares tumbling.\n\nStrategy (MSTR) stock fell over 5% during premarket hours on Thursday after bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell below 70,000. Strategy is one of the largest corporate holders of cryptocurrency.\n\nTapestry (TPR) stock rose 5% before the bell. Coach's parent company beat analysts' estimates on revenue and raised its full-year guidance.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) US-listed shares rose 5% before the bell on Thursday after announcing plans to issue its first dividend to shareholders, along with a three-year stock buyback program worth $5 billion.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) tumbled, falling $71,000 per token on Thursday after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the US government would not bail out the cryptocurrency.\n\nBut the leading cryptocurrency was paring deeper overnight losses in the wake of Bessent's comments, after entering the key mid-$70,000 support region.\n\nYahoo Finance's Ines Ferré and Grace O'Donnell report:\n\nSnap (SNAP) stock galloped higher after a strong holiday quarter for advertising lifted earnings above Wall Street's estimates.\n\nSnap stock rose 6% before the bell on Thursday.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, the video messaging app reported revenue of $1.71 billion and earnings per share of $0.03. That beat Wall Street estimates of $1.7 billion in revenue and a $0.03 loss per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (ELF) demonstrated resilience in the fourth quarter following a difficult 2025, with a strong earnings beat and guidance raise.\n\nThe affordable cosmetics manufacturer lifted its full-year 2026 sales outlook to a range of $1.6 billion to $1.61 billion from its previous range of $1.55 billion to $1.57 billion. The company also sees greater earnings per share of $3.05-$3.10, an increase from the previous range of $2.80-$2.85.\n\nThe stock soared by as much as 8% in premarket trading on Thursdayas the company looks to regain its footing after higher tariffs and other challenges led the stock to lose 40% in 2025. However, the stock pared some of those gains, perhaps due to lower gross margins amid ongoing tariff costs.\n\nLast year, the company also acquired Hailey Bieber's Rhode brand.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, e.l.f. reported better-than-expected earnings per share of $0.65 versus $0.55 expected by Wall Street analysts. Net sales jumped 38% to $489.5 million, topping estimates of $461 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\n\"Our value proposition, powerhouse innovation and disruptive marketing engine continue to fuel our brands,\" CEO Tarang Amin said in a statement. \"We remain confident in our ability to grow market share and deliver best-in-class growth in beauty, as reflected by our raised fiscal 2026 outlook.\"\n\nRead more about e.l.f.'s quarter from Reuters.\n\nArm Holdings shares fall as licensing sales miss estimates.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) stock rose 5% before the bell on Thursday following Alphabet's (GOOG) capital expenditure plans, which surpassed analysts' expectations.\n\nGoogle's parent company forecast 2026 capital expenditures of $180 billion, news that is a potential boon to Broadcom, which partners with Alphabet on custom chips.\n\n“That is an incredible number. We are laughing because that number is so good for the Google cohort,” Ben Reitzes, Melius Research head of technology research, told CNBC.\n\nGoogle is not the only company increasing its capex spend to build AI data centers: Oracle (ORCL) is doing the same and raised its forecast to around $50 billion.\n\nGoogle's AI software doesn't just use Nvidia (NVDA) chips, but it also uses its own tensor processing units (TPUs). For Gemini 3, Google used TPUs, which Broadcom helped to make.\n\nSilver (SI=F) fell sharply, wiping out a two-day recovery, as the white metal struggled to find a floor following a historic market rout. Gold (GC=F) also declined.\n\nSpot silver plunged as much as 17% on Thursday, having flickered briefly above $90 an ounce in early Asian trading. After a record-breaking rally that appeared to run too far, too fast, the metal has retreated by more than a third from an all-time high hit on Jan. 29.\n\n“Sentiment seems to have turned soggy across most asset classes, including regional equities and metals,” said Christopher Wong, a strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. This has created “a feedback loop amid thin market liquidity,” he said.\n\nThe sudden and sharp decline in precious metals also weighed on sentiment in base metals markets, with copper falling more than 1% to slip below $13,000 a ton. Meanwhile, spot gold dropped as much as 3.5% in choppy trading.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) stock fell around 11% in premarket trading on Thursday after the chip designer's results beat on the top and bottom lines but its forecast was lighter than expected. A memory chip shortage stemming from data center developers scooping up chips and chipmakers shifting production to cater to AI demand added pressure to the company's outlook.\n\nIn the fiscal first quarter, the company said revenue increased 5% year over year to $12.3 billion, while earnings per share rose to $2.78. Qualcomm beat analyst estimates on the top and bottom lines, with consensus estimates forecasting $12.1 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $2.75, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nHowever, the outlook for the fiscal second quarter dimmed as a supply crunch in memory chips weighs on margins and the smartphone market.\n\nSecond quarter revenue is expected in the range of $10.2 billion to $11 billion (analysts were looking for $11 billion at the midpoint). Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 (the Street was hoping for $2.87).\n\n\"While our near-term handsets outlook is impacted by industry-wide memory supply constraints, we are encouraged by end-consumer demand for premium and high tier smartphones, and remain on track to achieve our fiscal 2029 revenue goals,” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said in the earnings release.",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly dipped below $70,000 per token on Thursday after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the US government would not bail out the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn a heated back-and-forth during a House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, Bessent was asked if the US Treasury had the authority to buy bitcoin or other cryptos.\n\n\"I do not have the authority to do that, and as chair of FSOC, I do not have that authority,\" Bessent stated.\n\nBitcoin fell to as low as $69,936 apiece early Thursday, continuing the slump on Wednesday that followed Bessent's comments.\n\nThe decline was also fueled by the broader selling pressure in markets and a warning from notable investor Michael Burry that a sustained decline in bitcoin's price could \"set in motion a death spiral leading to massive value destruction.\"\n\nHow has Bitcoin performed in recent months?\n\nWhy did Bitcoin drop below $70,000 on Thursday?\n\nWhat did Treasury Secretary Bessent say about cryptocurrency?\n\nWhat technical factors are driving current crypto market weakness?\n\n\"Bitcoin has been exposed as a purely speculative asset, and is not near the debasement trade hedge that gold and other precious metals are,\" Burry, who rose to prominence after predicting the 2008 financial crisis, wrote in his Substack.\n\nThe move lower on Thursday only added to bitcoin's recent rout. The world's largest cryptocurrency is down nearly 20% year-to-date.\n\nBitcoin dropped sharply last weekend to notch its fourth straight month of losses.\n\nThe move lower coincided with President Trump's announcement last Friday selecting Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve when Jerome Powell's term ends in May, a nomination markets view as hawkish.\n\nEther (ETH-USD) and other digital tokens also slid.\n\nAfter bitcoin earlier broke through the key support level at $73,000, 10X Research strategists wrote that \"current flows suggest sentiment has shifted meaningfully.\"\n\nThe firm's strategists pointed to flow and positioning data, which indicated \"investors are not yet positioned to buy the dip.\"\n\n\"While sentiment and technical indicators are approaching extreme levels, the broader downtrend remains intact,\" the researchers wrote. \"In the absence of a clear catalyst, there is little urgency to step in.\"\n\nThe firm noted that traders remain focused on deleveraging and unwinding their positions rather than on preparing for a typical snapback rally.\n\nPressure on digital assets reflected the broader fragility across the crypto market.

Prices had dropped as much as 17% earlier in the session.\n\nThursday's slide erased two days of gains for the white metal, which plunged as much as 36% on Friday at the height of the selloff.\n\nThe drop marks a sharp reversal for a market that had been on a tear just days earlier, with silver hitting a record high above $121 per ounce last week.\n\nGold also retreated, slipping below the $5,000 level to trade around $4,934 per ounce.\n\nPrices of the precious metals came amid a rise in the US Dollar Index to a two-week high, which makes dollar-denominated commodities pricier.\n\n\"The inverse relationship between precious metals and the US dollar has reasserted itself, leaving gold and silver particularly sensitive to near-term FX moves,\" wrote Ewa Manthey, a commodities strategist at ING on Tuesday.\n\n\"Looking ahead, the dollar is likely to remain a key driver of short-term price action, with precious metals broadly moving in the opposite direction,\" she added.\n\nAnalysts warn that silver is likely to remain especially volatile, as the market is far smaller than gold — a dynamic that can amplify price swings.\n\nEven before Friday's selloff, hedge funds had already been trimming long positions in silver and other metals, with managed money reducing exposure to surging metals and reallocating into energy and other commodities.\n\nIn other corners of the market, risk assets more broadly were under pressure, with tech stocks and cryptocurrencies sliding in choppy trading.\n\nSoftware stocks came under pressure this week after Anthropic unveiled a new AI tool capable of handling clerical and administrative work in the legal sector. Legal software companies bore the brunt of the initial selloff, before losses rippled through the wider software space.\n\n\"In addition to accelerating layoffs of jobs replaced by AI solutions, software continues to sell off as advances in quick AI solutions threaten all but those players with major moats around their client relationships,\" wrote Louis Navellier at Navellier & Associates on Wednesday.\n\nStephen Parker, co-head of global investment strategy at JPMorgan Private Bank, told CNBC on Wednesday that the tech selloff reflects a healthy rotation, with investors pivoting away from a tech-driven market in search of better opportunities elsewhere.\n\nThe tech selloff spilled over into Asia with tech stocks. On Thursday, Samsung Electronics and SoftBank Group Corp. falling by 6% and 7% respectively.\n\nBitcoin was trading around $71,200, down roughly 7% over the past 24 hours and about 19% lower over the last seven days.",

    "fullText": "Michael Saylor’s $10 million Bitcoin claim sparks backlash.\n\nIt comes as Strategy’s losses deepen as Bitcoin price slides.\n\nWhether Saylor will sell Bitcoin remains possible.\n\nMichael Saylor, executive chairman of the Bitcoin-focused firm Strategy, is facing renewed criticism. He claimed that BTC would surge to $10 million “tomorrow” if people agreed with his views.\n\nThis comes even as his company’s Bitcoin holdings slide into multibillion-dollar unrealized losses and its share price continues to fall.\n\nThe comments, made in a recent video, have drawn sharp backlash online as tension between Saylor’s long-term Bitcoin thesis and the financial strain on Strategy’s balance sheet reaches boiling point.\n\nIn the video, Saylor described Bitcoin’s price volatility as a feature rather than a flaw, arguing it benefits committed investors while deterring short-term participants.\n\n“Volatility was a gift to the faithful,” Saylor said, adding that sharp price swings scare away “tourists” and those unwilling to commit time and effort to understanding Bitcoin.\n\nSaylor went on to suggest that Bitcoin’s price was being held back by a lack of consensus.\n\n“If people in the rest of the world knew what I know, and they understood and they agreed with me, Bitcoin would go to $10 million tomorrow,” he said.\n\nHe argued that such a move would ultimately harm long-term investors by eliminating years of opportunity to accumulate Bitcoin at lower prices.\n\n“I want you to think about how you would feel and how your viewers would feel, because you would lose 20 years of stacking opportunity during which you get to buy it less than $10 million,” he said.\n\nSaylor’s remarks triggered a wave of criticism on social media, where users questioned his logic and mindset as Bitcoin’s price continues to fall.\n\nOne post responded sarcastically: “If everyone knew what I knew and agreed with me about the value of something I own I’d be worth $10 trillion.”\n\nAnother compared Bitcoin to speculative bubbles of the past, writing: “Very sad for those that follow him. At least tulips are beautiful.”\n\nOther critics focused on technical and economic concerns surrounding Bitcoin.\n\nOne user said Saylor ignored “non-competitive energy costs versus AI, halving destroying miner economics, and increasing centralization.”\n\nAnother called Saylor “the most insufferable person on the planet right now.”",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell 2% on Wednesday to around $73,000 per token after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the US government would not bail out the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn a heated back-and-forth during a House Financial Services Committee hearing, Bessent was asked if the US Treasury had the authority to buy bitcoin or other cryptos.\n\n\"I do not have the authority to do that, and as chair of FSOC, I do not have that authority,\" Bessent stated.\n\nThe decline on Wednesday was also fueled by the broader selling pressure in markets and a warning from notable investor Michael Burry that a sustained decline in bitcoin's price could \"set in motion a death spiral leading to massive value destruction.\"\n\n\"Bitcoin has been exposed as a purely speculative asset, and is not near the debasement trade hedge that gold and other precious metals are,\" Burry, who rose to prominence after predicting the 2008 financial crisis, wrote in his Substack.\n\nThe move lower only added to bitcoin's recent rout. The world's largest cryptocurrency is down 13% over the past five days.\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency dropped sharply last weekend, touching its lowest levels since last April and notching a fourth straight month of losses.\n\nThe move lower coincided with President Trump's announcement on Friday selecting Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve when Jerome Powell's term ends in May, a nomination markets view as hawkish.\n\nWhat are analysts saying about Bitcoin's support levels?\n\nHow has Bitcoin performed over recent months?\n\nWhat is Michael Burry's warning about Bitcoin's decline?\n\nWhy did Bitcoin drop after Treasury Secretary Bessent's comments?\n\nEther (ETH-USD) and other digital tokens also slid.\n\nWith bitcoin's next support level at $73,000, \"current flows suggest sentiment has shifted meaningfully,\" 10X Research strategists wrote in a recent note.\n\nThe firm's strategists pointed to flow and positioning data, which indicated \"investors are not yet positioned to buy the dip.\"\n\n\"While sentiment and technical indicators are approaching extreme levels, the broader downtrend remains intact,\" the researchers wrote. \"In the absence of a clear catalyst, there is little urgency to step in.\"\n\nThe firm noted that traders remain focused on deleveraging and unwinding their positions rather than on preparing for a typical snapback rally.\n\nPressure on digital assets reflected the broader fragility across the crypto market. Aside from a brief bounce last month, bitcoin has struggled since October, when whale selling and forced liquidations swept through the industry.",

    "description": "Bitcoin crashes below $73,000 amid technical breakdown, altcoin selloff, and regulatory uncertainty wiping billions from crypto portfolios.",
    "fullText": "Crypto portfolios just took a gut punch. Bitcoin briefly crashed below $73,000 on Tuesday, hitting $72,900—its lowest point since November 2024—before clawing back to around $75,658. That 6% intraday nosedive wiped out another chunk of what’s already been a brutal year, with Bitcoin now down 16% year-to-date. If you’re feeling like you’re watching your digital gold turn to digital dust, you’re not alone.\n\nFunding rates hit extreme zones while support levels that seemed solid start looking like mirages.\n\nThe technical picture looks about as appetizing as gas station sushi. Funding rates on Binance entered what analysts call an “extreme zone,” signaling traders are piling into short positions faster than people abandoning Twitter for BlueSky. Key resistance now sits at $74,000, while support hovers somewhere between $69,000 and $72,800—levels that feel as reliable as a crypto influencer’s price predictions. Volatility is spiking after a year of relative calm, because apparently the market decided boring was overrated.\n\nEthereum and XRP investors discover that diversification doesn’t work when everything moves in lockstep.\n\nWhile Bitcoin nurses a 4% daily bruise, altcoins are getting absolutely demolished. Ethereum dropped 25% over the past week, with XRP down 17%—proving once again that “altcoin season” often means “altcoin suffering season.” The carnage stems from a perfect storm of geopolitical jitters, the U.S. government shutdown scrambling economic data releases, and regulatory uncertainty that has investors fleeing anything riskier than Treasury bills.\n\nAnalysts offer conflicting views on whether fundamentals can overcome technical breakdown.\n\nRob Hadick from Dragonfly Capital argues the pullback “doesn’t appear driven by any single factor” and points to strong fundamentals from stablecoins and tokenized assets. Meanwhile, Alex Thorn at Galaxy Digital warns Bitcoin “may continue to drift lower” toward the 200-week moving average near $58,000. That’s a 20% drop from current levels—the kind of distance that separates hopeful hodlers from actual capitulation. With supply gaps gaping between $70,000-$80,000, this correction might have more room to run than anyone wants to admit.\n\nFrom the coolest cars to the must-have gadgets, GadgetReview’s daily newsletter keeps you in the know.

    "description": "The nomination of Kevin Warsh as Fed chair was the latest in a long line of hits absorbed by bitcoin in recent months.",
    "fullText": "It's entirely possible you missed the recent meltdown in bitcoin. Not to project, but there were other sell-offs in the likes of gold and silver sucking up most of the oxygen and attention. First Trade flicked at the losses, but it's time to give what's happened its full due.\n\nThe most recent damage absorbed by bitcoin came after the nomination of Kevin Warsh as the Federal Reserve's new chair. Warsh is viewed as a hawk — especially when it comes to the size of the central bank's balance sheet — and hawkishness is bad for risk assets like crypto.\n\nThe Warsh development explains the latest leg down, which pushed the price of bitcoin to its lowest level since Trump's election victory in November 2024.\n\nBut that's just the last 10% or so, in the last few days. What about the nearly-30% plunge in the several months before that?\n\nIn the fourth quarter of last year, investors rotated out of riskier assets like tech stocks and crypto. This coincided with the Fed taking a more conservative tone around future rate cuts, after having already eased multiple times in 2025.\n\nBut as stocks have since recovered to a series of fresh records, bitcoin has continued to flounder. Blame crypto-specific headwinds like delays in the passage of key crypto-regulation measures.\n\nAnd then there are the bitcoin-treasury firms, most notably Strategy, which have positioned their businesses around amassing as much of the crypto as possible. As the price of bitcoin has tumbled, so has speculation that these big institutions could be forced to sell in size.\n\nThe level to watch is $76,000. That's the average that Strategy has paid for its tokens. If the price of bitcoin has fallen below it, that means the firm is sitting on paper losses. The mere prospect of that has investors on edge.\n\nThe commentary surrounding the latest bitcoin sell-off has been less than encouraging. John Blank, the chief strategist at Zacks Investment Research, says the token could sink all the way to $40,000 — about 45% below current levels. He also laid out three reasons why the ongoing crypto winter could last for months longer.\n\nEven famed \"Big Short\" investor Michael Burry got in on the action. He didn't explicitly call for further losses in bitcoin, instead focusing on a trio of \"sickening\" scenarios that could play out if the crypto keeps falling.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, bitcoin is in a tough spot right now. What happens with Strategy, and how far below their market net asset value it can trade, will be top of mind for investors.\n\nIn the meantime, the crypto market is only enticing for traders looking to bottom-fish. Fortune does tend to favor the bold, but you'd have to have serious guts to buy in right now.",

    "description": "Ripple unlocked 1 billion XRP from escrow as the token extended losses amid a broader crypto market downturn.",
    "fullText": "Ripple unlocked roughly 1 billion XRP (XRP) from escrow on February 1, continuing its long-standing monthly release schedule.\n\nThe scheduled unlock followed a weak close for XRP in January, when the token declined by more than 10%. Selling pressure extended into the new month, with prices slipping further in line with the broader market drawdown.\n\nAccording to on-chain data, the unlocks were split across four transfers of 100 million, 400 million, 100 million, and 400 million XRP, with a combined value of approximately $1.6 billion at the time of execution.\n\nRipple’s monthly unlocks are part of a structured supply management mechanism rather than an unexpected market event. Introduced in 2017, the system placed 55 billion XRP into escrow, allowing up to 1 billion XRP to be released each month in a transparent and predictable manner.\n\nUnder this framework, Ripple typically relocks between 60% and 80% of the unlocked tokens, retaining only a portion for operational expenses or liquidity demands. That pattern repeated this month.\n\nWhale Alert reported that Ripple relocked 700 million XRP to escrow in two separate transactions totaling 400 million and 300 million XRP, worth roughly $1.09 billion combined. As a result, a net 300 million XRP remains unlocked following the sequence.\n\nHistorically, these monthly escrow movements have had a limited immediate impact on the market. Nonetheless, XRP has been under pressure as overall risk appetite weakened across the market.\n\nBeInCrypto Markets data showed that XRP’s value declined by 10.6% in January, with the price falling to a low of $1.50 on the final trading day of the month, marking its lowest level since the October market crash.\n\nJust two days into February, XRP has already dropped by more than 6%, tracking the broader market downturn that has pushed Bitcoin and Ethereum to multi-month lows. At press time, XRP was trading at $1.57, down nearly 5% over the past 24 hours.\n\nAmid the ongoing drawdown, analysts remain split on whether a recovery or further declines are more likely. One analyst noted that XRP may be repeating a familiar long-term cycle. This suggests its next major rally may still be several years away.\n\nAccording to the analysis, XRP has historically moved through extended consolidation phases before breaking out sharply later in the cycle.\n\n“It is following the same patterns in every other cycle. The next pump won’t be until Q4 2028. $8–10+,\" the analyst wrote.",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin miners globally are facing increasing challenges to stay afloat in their business.\n\nThe whole Bitcoin-halving gambit and the volatility of crypto as a whole, thanks to geopolitical tensions, are making many miners move away from the business to something more sustainable, like artificial intelligence.\n\nThey have the machines, they have the power, so why not pivot?\n\nOne Bitcoin miner is facing an even bigger trouble, like a double-edged sword: bankruptcy and leadership turmoil.\n\nA Russian court has placed the parent company of BitRiver, the country’s largest Bitcoin mining firm, under official bankruptcy supervision.\n\nBitRiver was once a symbol of Russia’s industrial-scale crypto ambitions. At one point, it oversaw 15 data centers with a combined capacity of 533 megawatts and controlled over 50% of the domestic Bitcoin mining market, according to HSE Center for Electric Power Research. The company reported more than 10 billion rubles ($131.6 million) in revenue in 2024, before its power lines began to dim.\n\nOn Jan. 27, the Sverdlovsk Regional Arbitration Court initiated monitoring procedures for Fox Group of Companies LLC, which owns 98% of BitRiver Management Company, according to a report by Kommersant.\n\nInfrastructure of Siberia, part of energy conglomerate En+ Group, filed the bankruptcy petition over a canceled equipment supply deal. The firm paid more than 700 million rubles (approx. $9.1 million) in advance for mining hardware that never arrived.\n\nAfter the contract was terminated, courts sided with En+ in April 2025, but enforcement efforts found no recoverable assets, prompting the bankruptcy filing. BitRiver’s accounts were later frozen, a move legal experts warned could “paralyze operations,” Kommersant reported.\n\nLeading miner walks away from Bitcoin\n\nNasdaq sends delisting threat to another crypto firm\n\nAbundant Mines CEO says post-halving Bitcoin mining will look different\n\nThe En+ dispute is just one part of BitRiver’s broader financial unraveling. The company faces mounting electricity debts and multiple lawsuits from energy suppliers.\n\nCourts are reviewing claims totaling more than 940 million rubles ($12.2 million), including 133 million from En+ Sbyt, 640 million from the Irkutsk Electric Grid Company, and 168.7 million already awarded to NTEK. Regional utilities under Rosseti have also filed collection suits.\n\nBitRiver’s internal structure has deteriorated in parallel. Layoffs began in early 2025, followed by salary delays and executive resignations.",

    "fullText": "A famed crypto influencer has predicted Bitcoin’s price could fall to $30,000.\n\nThe comments come after a global market crash.\n\nTechnical signals have reinforced the bearish outlook.\n\nAnalysts and prominent market commentators have warned of deeper losses for Bitcoin following a violent sell-off across global financial markets that wiped out trillions of dollars in value.\n\nOn Thursday, well-known crypto influencer Crypto Bitlord warned that Bitcoin could fall significantly further, identifying $30,000 as the next major support level.\n\n“The next major support for bitcoin is $30k,” the X account wrote.\n\nBenjamin Cowen, founder of crypto analytics platform Into The Cryptoverse, echoed the bearish outlook, saying Bitcoin’s weakness aligns with historical trends and macroeconomic tightening.\n\n“Today, we’re going to talk about Bitcoin and discuss why the price is dropping and why I think it will likely continue to drop,” Cowen said in a recent YouTube video.\n\nCowen said he believes Bitcoin has already transitioned into a bear market after peaking in October 2025.\n\n“I do think Bitcoin is, in fact, in a bear market,” he said.\n\nBitcoin’s slide comes amid a broader global market rout that saw roughly $3 trillion in market value erased in less than an hour on Thursday.\n\nPrecious metals, despite recent historic rallies, were not spared.\n\nGold lost around $1.5 trillion in market value, with prices falling nearly 10% from recent highs, while silver fell about 12%.\n\nLongtime Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff took his chance to weigh in on BTC’s falling, arguing that the asset has significantly underperformed gold over the long term despite growing institutional support.\n\n“Bitcoin is now worth just 15.5 ounces of gold, down 57% from its 2021 high and just 10% above its 2017 high,” Schiff wrote.\n\n“Despite all the hype and support from Wall Street and the Trump administration, most people who now own Bitcoin would have been better off buying gold or silver instead,” he added.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, analysts say Bitcoin’s chart structure has deteriorated further.\n\nVictor Olanrewaju, an analyst at CCN, said Bitcoin confirmed a bearish reversal pattern on the daily chart after breaking key support levels.\n\n“From a technical perspective, Bitcoin’s price extended its sell-off, breaking below the $86,400 neckline and confirming a head-and-shoulders breakdown on the daily chart,” Olanrewaju said.",

    "fullText": "Every time the crypto market enters a dramatic phase, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood is one of the first investors I turn to in order to understand the changing dynamics on the charts.\n\nWood is a veteran investor in the digital assets market. In fact, she claimed that ARK Invest was the first public asset manager to gain Bitcoin (BTC) exposure in 2015.\n\nBitcoin hadn't reached even the $500 price mark in 2015, but it was a significant uptick since its launch in 2009. But Wood's pro-crypto move was met with sharp criticism.\n\nHowever, the confidence seems to have paid off over the years as Bitcoin kept hitting new highs. ARK Invest estimates the cryptocurrency's price will hit $1 million in 2030.\n\nWood also keeps buying shares of crypto companies such as:\n\nCoinbase (Nasdaq: COIN), the largest crypto exchange in the U.S.\n\nRobinhood Markets (Nasdaq: HOOD), an e-trading platform with crypto and tokenized stock offerings\n\nBlock (NYSE: SQ), Jack Dorsey's Bitcoin technology company\n\nBitmine Immersion Technologies (NYSE: BMNR), the world's largest Ethereum (ETH) treasury company\n\nBullish (NYSE: BLSH), the crypto exchange backed by Peter Thiel\n\nGiven Wood's deep expertise in crypto investments, it is worth understanding her perspective in the wake of Bitcoin's crash below $80,000 on Jan. 31.\n\nLorenzo Valente, ARK Invest's Director of Research, Digital Assets, recently shared an analysis in which he compared gold's market cap as a percentage of the U.S. M2 money supply.\n\nM2 is a broad measure of the U.S. money supply (cash, checking, savings, money market funds).\n\nAs per the analysis, gold's market cap is 170% of the entire U.S. money supply right now.\n\nThe figure is an all-time high (ATH); in fact, it is as high as it was in 1934 during the Great Depression and only slightly above the figure in 1980 when inflation peaked, the chart showed.\n\nIn simple words, gold is as expensive as it can be. Such peaks usually happen during periods of economic stress and dollar regime shift and often mark turning points, Valente said. For instance, gold crashed 60% after 1980.\n\nEven right now, it feels like a \"pivot moment\" and while nobody knows what happens next, those who know can make huge gains, he added.\n\nWhen ARK Invest shared its 2026 outlook on Jan. 15, the asset manager noted that the correlation between the Bitcoin and gold prices has been very low at 0.14 since early 2020.\n\nThis is exactly what Wood reiterated in response to Valente's X post. In simple terms, Bitcoin and gold usually don't move together on a daily or monthly basis.",

    "description": "Bitcoin fell toward $83,000 as the U.S. entered a partial shutdown, with traders leaning defensive ahead of a House vote expected Monday.",
    "fullText": "Crypto prices remained under pressure on Friday as the U.S. government entered a partial shutdown after lawmakers missed a midnight funding deadline, adding another layer of uncertainty to a market already struggling to find buyers.\n\nBitcoin traded around $83,559, up about 1% on the day but down roughly 6.8% over the past week, according to the price screen.\n\nEther sat near $2,686, down about 1.9% in the past 24 hours and 9% on the week. XRP changed hands near $1.72, down about 1.6% on the day and close to 10% lower over seven days.\n\nThe shutdown itself looks short. The Senate passed a funding package, but the House is out until Monday, so the government will still hit a technical lapse over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Saturday that it would operate with \"very limited staff\" from Jan. 31 onward due to the shutdown.\n\nThat timing matters for risk assets because it lands right into thin weekend liquidity and a heavy headline cycle, which may pressure bitcoin and the broader crypto market over the weekend.\n\nThere is also a clean crypto angle here that is not just “risk off.” Prediction markets have spent the past 24 hours showing how messy the definition of “shutdown” can get.\n\nTraders on Polymarket and Kalshi were forced to think like lawyers. The government can be “shut” on paper at 12:01 a.m. and still look normal to most people for two days. That gap between legal status and real-world impact is exactly where contract wording and settlement rules start to bite.\n\nFor crypto, the shutdown headline is more of a sentiment stress test than a direct economic shock. It keeps traders cautious, pushes people toward smaller position sizes, and makes dips feel heavier because buyers do not want to step in front of a weekend news tape.",

    "fullText": "Long-term Bitcoin holders are selling a lot right now, putting downward pressure on the price.\n\nThe market has absorbed much of this selling so far, with big buyers stepping in to support it.\n\nA full crash is unlikely in the near term, but Bitcoin could still drop further if selling continues.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has started 2026 on shaky ground, grinding between $88,000 and $90,000 after falling hard from its $124,000 peak.\n\nAs the market searches for a clear direction, one storyline is dominating the conversation.\n\nLong-term Bitcoin holders (LTHs)—investors who have held BTC for at least 155 days—may be starting to sell in size.\n\nIf that trend holds, it could add fresh pressure to an already fragile market and fuel fears that a deeper pullback is still ahead.\n\nAccording to Glassnode data, Bitcoin long-term holders are dumping BTC faster than during the October 2025 crash.\n\nOver the past 30 days, these LTHs have sold approximately 143,000 BTC, valued at around $9.5 billion at current prices.\n\nThis marks the fastest pace of divestment since August 2025, reversing a brief accumulation phase from late December 2025 to early January 2026.\n\nGlassnode’s data shows that mid-term holders (1-5 years) are still offloading supply, while longer-term holders (over 5 years) show signs of stabilization or even minor accumulation.\n\nFor instance, the BTC supply that has been inactive for over five years increased by 95,500 coins in the last month, suggesting that not all veteran holders are panicking.\n\nHowever, this selling adds supply to the market and puts downward pressure on prices.\n\nCryptoQuant echoes this, noting that LTH sales began when prices surpassed $40,000, distinguishing this cycle from previous bull markets where holders were more steadfast.\n\nBitcoin’s price weakness isn’t isolated to LTH behavior. Over 22% of BTC supply is held at a loss, a level last seen in early 2022 and mid-2018, heightening sensitivity to further declines.\n\nShort-term holders (STHs), who are price-sensitive, are particularly vulnerable; their spent output profit ratio sits at 0.99, just below breakeven, suggesting potential capitulation if support breaks.\n\nGlassnode warned that failure to hold key levels, such as the -1 standard deviation of the STH cost basis or the true market mean, could resume LTH selling.\n\nMacro factors add layers of complexity to the current bearish market trends.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged despite a depleting dollar.\n\nInstitutional inflows via spot ETFs have been mixed, with $1.3 billion in outflows recently, yet firms like Strategy have absorbed over 40,000 BTC in 2026 alone.",

    "fullText": "Advertising Standards Authority says firm advised by George Osborne ‘trivialised risks of cryptocurrency’\n\nA cryptocurrency company advised by George Osborne has been banned from showing a set of adverts that suggested using its services could be a solution to the cost of living crisis.\n\nCoinbase, which appointed the former Conservative chancellor to chair its global advisory council last year, has been told by the UK’s advertising watchdog that its adverts were “irresponsible” and “trivialised the risks of cryptocurrency”.\n\nThe adverts from the US crypto exchange include a sarcastic two-minute video showing people singing “everything is just fine, everything is grand” as their home falls into a state of disrepair and suffers a power cut, while outside Britons cheerfully dance through streets littered with rats and piles of overflowing bin bags.\n\nAs the ad progresses, a shopper faces rising prices for fish fingers in a supermarket, white-collar workers lose their jobs, a sewage pipe bursts and rubbish falls from the sky.\n\nThe clip ends with large text saying: “If everything’s fine, don’t change anything”, before being replaced with the Coinbase logo. The company, which was founded in 2012, provides a platform for people to buy and sell various cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the advertising campaign, which launched in August, implied that using Coinbase could be an alternative to the financial concerns associated with the cost of living, and so trivialised the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies.\n\n“We considered that using humour to reference serious financial concerns, alongside a cue to ‘change’, risked presenting complex, high-risk financial products as an easy or obvious response to those concerns,” it said.\n\nOsborne was appointed in December to run Coinbase’s global advisory council to assist with the company’s lobbying in the UK and EU, having already been an adviser to the company for the past two years.\n\nThe company’s chief policy officer at the time said Osborne would play an “active role in helping us with policymakers around the world”. Last August, the former Tory MP had written a column in the Financial Times warning that the UK has been left behind in the cryptocurrency boom and is in danger of missing a second wave of demand.\n\nThe former politician last month added a role at ChatGPT developer OpenAI to his portfolio of positions, which also includes being the chair of the British Museum and a co-host of a podcast with the former Labour minister Ed Balls.\n\nThree posters from Coinbase were also banned by the ASA, which in large letters stated: “Home ownership out of reach,” as well as “real wages stuck in 2008” and “eggs now out of budget”. Small white background text read: “Everything is fine”repeatedly. The bottom of the poster said: “If everything’s fine, don’t change anything” next to the Coinbase logo.\n\nNeither the video nor the posters contained any information about the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies, the ASA said, despite the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority warning that cryptocurrency is “largely unregulated and high risk, and that buyers should be prepared to lose all of their money”.\n\nThe video advert by Coinbase had already been banned from television by Clearcast, which approves television ads in the UK, but the ASA said it had been shown on multiple online platforms, while the posters had been displayed in “high-traffic areas such as the London Underground and rail stations”.\n\nA spokesperson for Coinbase said: “While we respect the ASA’s decision, we fundamentally disagree with the characterisation of a campaign that critically reflects widely reported economic conditions as socially irresponsible.\n\n“The advert was intended to provoke discussion about the state of the financial system and the need to consider better futures, not to offer simplistic solutions or minimise risk.\n\n“While digital assets are not a panacea, we believe their responsible adoption can play a constructive role in a more efficient and freer financial system. Coinbase remains committed to authentic, thought-provoking communication and to operating responsibly within the UK’s regulatory framework.”",

    "fullText": "Ray Dalio warned the U.S. stands “on the brink” of transitioning from Stage 5 pre-breakdown to Stage 6 systemic collapse as Bitcoin is trading defensively at $88,000, trapped in a 60-day range by record institutional selling pressure from American counterparties.\n\nThe billionaire investor’s latest analysis of the “Big Cycle” coincides with Bitcoin’s failure to live up to its “digital gold” narrative, while traditional safe havens surge to all-time highs.\n\nDalio’s framework identifies bankrupt government finances and wealth gaps as the “single most reliable leading indicator of civil war or revolution,” conditions he argues now characterize American reality.\n\nMeanwhile, Wintermute’s desk reports that Bitcoin remains stuck between $85,000 and $94,000 as U.S. spot ETF products hemorrhage capital and the Coinbase premium trades at a persistent discount, indicating that domestic institutions are driving bearish momentum.\n\nDalio’s long essay positions current American conditions within Stage 5 of his Big Cycle framework, where “bad financial conditions and intense conflict” precede systemic breakdown.\n\n“We are now clearly on the brink of crossing from Stage 5 (pre-breakdown) to Stage 6 (breakdown),” he wrote, pointing to unsustainable debt loads that force governments to either “print a lot of money, which depreciates its value” or implement painful austerity.\n\nThe analysis comes as Bitcoin trades range-bound for 60 consecutive days, an unusual pattern for an asset class often marketed as protection against exactly the monetary debasement Dalio describes.\n\nGold climbed above $5,066 per ounce on Tuesday while silver surged 6.4% to $110.60, both setting fresh records as investors sought traditional inflation hedges.\n\nDalio warned that “later stages may involve capital controls, reserve freezes, and cross-border restrictions, turning funds into political tools,” conditions that typically favor “freely transferable assets” and investments “prioritizing resistance to freezing and blockades.“\n\nBitcoin proponents have long argued that crypto fits this profile, yet the asset has failed to attract safe-haven flows amid elevated macro uncertainty.\n\nWintermute’s OTC desk identified American selling pressure as the primary force keeping Bitcoin suppressed within its trading range.",

    "title": "\"Bitcoin Jesus\" Avoided Prison, Thanks to One of the \"Friends of Trump\"",
    "description": "Billionaire fugitive Roger Ver was facing federal criminal charges until he sought the services of a select club of President Donald Trump’s former personal attorneys who have easy access to top Justice Department appointees.",
    "fullText": "These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nDays into President Donald Trump’s second term in the White House, a cryptocurrency billionaire posted a video on X to his hundreds of thousands of followers. “Please Donald Trump, I need your help,” he said, wearing a flag pin askew and seated awkwardly in an armchair. “I am an American. … Help me come home.”\n\nThe speaker, 46-year-old Roger Ver, was in fact no longer a U.S. citizen. Nicknamed “Bitcoin Jesus” for his early evangelism for digital currency, Ver had renounced his citizenship more than a decade earlier. At the time of his video, Ver was under criminal indictment for millions in tax evasion and living on the Spanish island of Mallorca. His top-flight legal defense team had failed around half a dozen times to persuade the Justice Department to back down. The U.S., considering him a fugitive, was seeking his extradition from Spain, and he was likely looking at prison.\n\nOnce, prosecutors hoped to make Ver a marquee example amid concerns about widespread cryptocurrency tax evasion. They had spent eight painstaking years working the case. Just nine months after his direct-to-camera appeal, however, Ver and Trump’s new Justice Department leadership cut a remarkable deal to end his prosecution. Ver wouldn’t have to plead guilty or spend a day in prison. Instead, the government accepted a payout of $49.9 million — roughly the size of the tax bill prosecutors said he dodged in the first place — and allowed him to walk away.\n\nVer was able to pull off this coup by taking advantage of a new dynamic inside of Trump’s Department of Justice. A cottage industry of lawyers, lobbyists and consultants with close ties to Trump has sprung up to help people and companies seek leniency, often by arguing they had been victims of political persecution by the Biden administration. In his first year, Trump issued pardons or clemency to dozens of people who were convicted of various forms of white-collar crime, including major donors and political allies. Investigations have been halted. Cases have been dropped.\n\nWithin the Justice Department, a select club of Trump’s former personal attorneys have easy access to the top appointees, some of whom also previously represented Trump. It has become a dark joke among career prosecutors to refer to these lawyers as the “Friends of Trump.”\n\nThe Ver episode, reported in detail here for the first time, reveals the extent to which white-collar criminal enforcement has eroded under the Trump administration. The account is based on interviews with current and former Justice Department officials, case records and conversations with people familiar with his case.\n\nThe Trump administration has particularly upended the way tax law violators are handled. Late last year, the administration essentially dissolved the team dedicated to criminal tax enforcement, dividing responsibility among a number of other offices and divisions. Tax prosecutions fell by more than a quarter, and more than a third of the 80 experienced prosecutors working on criminal tax cases have quit.\n\nBut even amid this turmoil, Ver’s case stands out. After Ver added several of these new power brokers to his team — most importantly, former Trump attorney Chris Kise — Trump appointees commandeered the case from career prosecutors. One newly installed Justice Department leader who had previously represented Trump’s family questioned his new subordinates on whether tax evasion should be a criminal offense. Ver’s team wielded unusual control over the final deal, down to dictating that the agreement would not include the word “fraud.”\n\nIt remains the only tax prosecution the administration has killed outright.\n\nVer did not reply to an extensive list of questions from ProPublica. In court filings and dealings with the Justice Department, Ver had always denied dodging his tax bill intentionally — a key distinction between a criminal and civil tax violation — and claimed to have relied on the advice of accountants and tax attorneys.\n\n“Roger Ver took full responsibility for his gross financial misconduct to the tune of $50 million because this Department of Justice did not shy away from exposing those who cheat the system. The notion that any defendant can buy their way out of accountability under this administration is not founded in reality,” said Natalie Baldassarre, a Justice Department spokesperson.\n\nIn response to a list of detailed questions, the White House referred ProPublica to the Justice Department.“I know of no cases like this,” said Scott Schumacher, a former tax prosecutor and the director of the graduate program in taxation at the University of Washington. It is nearly unheard of for the department to abandon an indicted criminal case years in the making. “They’re basically saying you can buy your way out of a tax evasion prosecution.”\n\nRoger Ver is not a longtime ally of Trump’s or a MAGA loyalist. He renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2014, a day he once called “the happiest day of my entire life.” In the early days of bitcoin, he controlled about 1% of the world’s supply.\n\nVer is clean-cut and fit — he has a black belt in Brazilian jujitsu. In his early 20s, while he was a libertarian activist in California, Ver was sentenced to 10 months in prison for illegally selling explosives on eBay. He’s often characterized that first brush with the law as political persecution by the state. After his release, he left the U.S. for Japan.\n\nVer became a fixture in the 2010s on the budding cryptocurrency conference circuit, where he got a kick out of needling government authority and arguing that crypto was the building block of a libertarian utopia. At a 2017 blockchain conference in Aspen, Colorado, Ver announced he had raised $100 million and was seeking a location to create a new “non-country” without any central government. For years, Ver has recommended other wealthy people consider citizenship in the small Caribbean nation of Saint Kitts and Nevis, which has no individual income tax.\n\n“Bitcoin completely undermines the power of every single government on the entire planet to control the money supply, to tax people’s income to control them in any way,” he told a gathering of anarcho-capitalists in Acapulco, Mexico, in 2016. “It makes it so incredibly easy for people to hide their income or evade taxes.” More than one friend, he said with a smirk, had asked him how to do so: They “say, ‘Roger, I need your help. How do I use bitcoins to avoid paying taxes on it?’”\n\nRenouncing U.S. citizenship isn’t a magic get-out-of-tax-free technique. Since 2008, the U.S. has required expatriates with assets above $2 million pay a steep “exit tax” on the appreciation of all their property.\n\nIn 2024, the Justice Department indicted Ver in one of the largest-ever cryptocurrency tax fraud cases. The government accused Ver of lying to the IRS twice. After Ver renounced his citizenship in 2014, he claimed to the IRS that he personally did not own any bitcoin. He would later admit in his deal with the government to owning at least 130,664 bitcoin worth approximately $73.7 million at the time. Then in 2017, the government alleged, Ver tried to conceal the transfer of roughly $240 million in bitcoin from U.S. companies to his personal accounts. In all, the government said he had evaded nearly $50 million in taxes.\n\nVer’s defense was that his failure to pay taxes arose from a lack of clarity as to how tax law treated emerging cryptocurrency, good-faith accounting errors and reliance on his advisors’ advice. He claimed it was difficult to distinguish between his personal assets and his companies’ holdings and pinpoint what the bitcoin was actually worth.\n\nThe Biden administration’s Justice Department dismissed this legal argument. Prosecutors had troves of emails that they said showed Ver misleading his own attorneys and tax preparers about the extent of his bitcoin holdings. (Ver’s team accused the government of taking his statements out of context.) The asset tracing in the case was “rock solid,” according to a person familiar with the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. A jury, prosecutors maintained, was unlikely to buy Ver’s defense that he made a good-faith error.\n\nIn Trump, Ver saw a possible way out. After the 2024 election, he was “barking up every tree,” said his friend Brock Pierce, a fellow ultrawealthy crypto investor who tried to gin up sympathy for Ver in Trump’s orbit.\n\nVer had initially gone the orthodox route of hiring tax attorneys from a prestigious law firm, Steptoe. Like many wealthy people in legal jeopardy, Ver now also launched a media blitz seeking a pardon from the incoming president.“If anybody knows what it’s like to be the victim of lawfare it’s Trump, so I think he’ll be able to see it in this case as well,” Ver said in a December 2024 appearance on Tucker Carlson’s show. On Charlie Kirk’s show, Ver appeared with tape over his mouth with the word “censored” written in red ink. Laura Loomer, the Trump-friendly influencer, began posting that Ver’s prosecution was unfair. Ver paid Trump insider Roger Stone $600,000 to lobby Congress for an end to the tax provision he was accused of violating.\n\nVer’s pardon campaign fizzled. His public pressure campaign — in which he kept comparing himself to Trump — was not landing, according to Pierce. “You aren’t doing yourself any favors — shut up,” his friend recalled saying.\n\nOne objection in the White House, according to a person who works on pardons, may have been Ver’s flamboyant rejection of his American citizenship. Less than a week after Trump was inaugurated, Elon Musk weighed in, posting on X, “Roger Ver gave up his US citizenship. No pardon for Ver. Membership has its privileges.”\n\nBut inside the Justice Department, Ver found an opening. The skeleton key proved to be one of the “Friends of Trump,” a seasoned defense lawyer named Christopher Kise. Kise is a longtime Florida Republican power player who served as the state’s solicitor general and has argued before the U.S. Supreme Court. He earned a place in Trump’s inner circle as one of the first experienced criminal defenders willing to represent the president after his 2020 election loss. Kise defended Trump in the Justice Department investigation stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and against charges that Trump mishandled classified documents when leaving the White House.\n\nKise had worked shoulder-to-shoulder on Trump’s cases with two lawyers who were now leaders in the Trump 2.0 Justice Department: Todd Blanche, who runs day-to-day operations at the department as deputy attorney general, and his associate deputy attorney general, Ketan Bhirud, who oversaw the criminal tax division prosecuting Ver. Kise reportedly helped select Blanche to join Trump’s legal team in the documents case, and he and Bhirud had both worked for Trump’s family as they fought civil fraud charges brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James in 2022.\n\nOn Ver’s legal team, Kise worked the phones, pressing his old colleagues to rethink their prosecution against Ver.\n\nKise scored the legal team’s first big victory in years: a meeting with Bhirud that cut out the career attorneys most familiar with the merits of the case.\n\nIn that meeting, however, it wasn’t clear that the new Justice Department leadership would be willing to interfere with the trajectory of Ver’s case. While the Trump administration had backed off aggressive enforcement of white-collar crimes writ large, the administration said it was still pursuing most criminal cases that had already been charged.\n\nBhirud initially expressed skepticism that Ver accidentally underpaid his taxes. It was “hard to believe” that a man going by “Bitcoin Jesus” would have no idea how much bitcoin he owned, Bhirud said, according to a person familiar with the case.\n\nBhirud and Blanche did not respond to detailed questions from ProPublica.\n\nThe Justice Department stuck to its position that either Ver would plead guilty to a crime, or the case would go to trial.\n\nBut Kise would not stop lobbying his former colleagues to reconsider. Blanche and Bhirud had already demanded that career officials justify the case again and again. Over the course of the summer, Kise wore down the Trump appointees’ zeal for pursuing Ver on criminal charges.\n\nKise and the law firm of Steptoe did not respond to questions.\n\n“While there were meetings and conversations with DOJ, that is not uncommon. The line attorneys remained engaged throughout the process, and the case was ultimately resolved based on the strength of the evidence,” said Bryan Skarlatos, one of Ver’s tax attorneys and a partner at Kostelanetz.\n\nIt was a chaotic moment at the Justice Department, an institution that Trump had incessantly accused of being “weaponized” against him and his supporters. After Trump took office, the department was flooded with requests to reconsider prosecutions, with defendants claiming the Biden administration had singled them out for political persecution, too.\n\nWhile many cases failed to grab the administration’s attention, Kise got results. Last week, Kise’s client Julio Herrera Velutini, a Venezuelan-Italian billionaire accused of trying to bribe the former governor of Puerto Rico, received a pardon from Trump.\n\n“Every defense attorney is running the ‘weaponization’ play. This guy gets an audience because of who he is, because his name is Chris Kise,” said a person who recently attended a high-level meeting Kise secured to talk the Justice Department down from prosecuting a client.\n\nAs Kise stepped up the pressure, Ver’s case ate up a significant share of Bhirud’s time, despite his job overseeing more than 1,000 Justice Department attorneys, according to people familiar with the matter. Ordinarily, it would be rare for a political appointee to be so involved, especially to the exclusion of career prosecutors who could weigh in on the merits.\n\nBhirud began to muse to coworkers about whether failure to pay one’s taxes should really be considered a crime. Wasn’t it more of a civil matter? It seemed to a colleague that Bhirud was aware Ver’s advocates could try to elevate the case to the White House.\n\nThe government ceded ground and offered to take prison time off the table. Eventually, Ver’s team and Bhirud hit on the deal that would baffle criminal tax experts. They agreed on a deferred prosecution agreement that would allow Ver to avoid criminal charges and prison in exchange for a payout and an agreement not to violate any more laws. The government usually reserves such an agreement for lawbreaking corporations to avoid putting large employers out of business — not for fugitive billionaires.\n\nVer’s team enjoyed a remarkable ability to dictate terms. They rejected the text of the government’s supposed final offer because it required him to admit to “fraud,” according to a person familiar with the negotiations. In the end, Ver agreed to admit only to a “willful” failure to report and pay taxes on all his bitcoin and turned over the $50 million.\n\nThe government arrived at that figure in a roundabout manner. It dropped its claim that Ver had lied on his 2017 tax return. The $50 million figure was based on how much he had evaded in taxes in 2014 alone, plus what the government asserted were interest and penalties. In the end, the deal amounted to the sum he allegedly owed in the first place. He never even had to leave Mallorca to appear in a U.S. court.\n\nUnder any previous administration, convincing the leadership of the tax division to drop an indicted criminal case and accept a monetary penalty instead would be a nonstarter. While the Justice Department settles most tax matters civilly through fines, when prosecutors do charge criminal fraud, their conviction rate is over 90%.\n\nPeople “always ask you, ‘Can’t I just pay the taxes and it’ll go away?’” said Jack Townsend, a former DOJ tax attorney. “The common answer that everybody gave — until the Trump administration — was that, no, you can’t do that.”\n\nWhen the Justice Department announced the resolution in October, it touted it as a victory.\n\n“We are pleased that Mr. Ver has taken responsibility for his past misconduct and satisfied his obligations to the American public,” Bhirud said in the Justice Department’s press release announcing the deferred prosecution agreement. “This resolution sends a clear message: whether you deal in dollars or digital assets, you must file accurate tax returns and pay what you owe.”\n\nInside the Justice Department, the resolution was demoralizing: “He’s admitted he owes money, and we get money, but everything else about it stinks to high heaven,” said a current DOJ official familiar with the case. “We shouldn’t negotiate with people who are fugitives, as if they have power over us.”\n\nAmong the wealthy targets of white-collar criminal investigations, the Ver affair sent a different message. Lawyers who specialize in that kind of work told ProPublica that more and more clients are asking which of the “Friends of Trump” they should hire. One prominent criminal tax defense lawyer said he would give his clients a copy of Ver’s agreement and tell them, “These are the guys who got this done.”\n\nThe only one of Ver’s many lawyers to sign it was Christopher Kise.",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) traded higher on Thursday as global risk sentiment improved after US President Donald Trump walked back his plan to impose new tariffs on European allies amid his push to acquire Greenland.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation (BTC-USD) rose about 1% over the past 24 hours to hover near $90,000 (£66,902), moving in tandem with equities in Asia and Europe. The broader cryptocurrency market cap climbed 2.7% to $3.18tn over the same period, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signalled a diplomatic shift on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, saying he would not pursue military action to acquire Greenland and had reached “the framework of a future deal” on the Danish territory with NATO allies.\n\nThe remarks injected fresh volatility into crypto markets. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell to an intraday low near $87,300 before rebounding back toward $90,000 as traders reassessed US trade policy risks and broader macro conditions. More than $625m in leveraged crypto positions were liquidated over 24 hours, split roughly evenly between longs and shorts across about 150,000 traders, according to Coinglass market data.\n\nAnalysts said the episode underscored how digital assets are reacting more directly to geopolitical and macro headlines.\n\n“Today’s sharp price swings highlight how closely crypto markets are tracking geopolitical and policy developments,” said Rachel Lin, CEO of SynFutures, noting that Trump’s signals on Greenland negotiations and a pause on potential EU tariffs “briefly improved global risk sentiment, prompting a rapid rebound in bitcoin alongside US equities”.\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo Finance UK, Lin added that while the move was headline-driven, “they reflect a deeper shift in market structure”, describing bitcoin (BTC-USD) as “increasingly behaving like a macro asset, reacting to changes in policy expectations and broader risk appetite”.\n\nOver the longer term, she said, institutional participation is supporting bitcoin’s (BTC-USD) evolution as “a maturing and globally relevant asset class, even amid elevated volatility”.\n\nGlobal equities rallied as Trump withdrew his threat to impose additional 10% tariffs on eight European countries, including the UK, after receiving what he called the “framework of a future deal” in NATO discussions regarding Greenland.\n\nIn Asia, Japan’s Nikkei gained nearly 2%, while South Korea’s Kospi broke above the 5,000 level for the first time. European markets opened higher, with the FTSE 100 up 0.7% at the open.",

With rookies Rasheer Fleming and Khaman Maluach, along with two-way player Jamaree Bouyea, assigned back to the team, the Valley hoped the trio would provide the spark needed to get back on track.\n\nFleming and Maluach had been traveling with the Phoenix Suns throughout the six-game road trip, earning minutes whenever the team needed them. Bouyea is coming off concussion protocol and has not played since early January.\n\nHowever, Wednesday’s game allowed the rookies to flourish with increased playing time.\n\nOct 24, 2025; Inglewood, California, USA; Los Angeles Clippers center Yanic Konan Niederhauser (14) defends Phoenix Suns center Khaman Maluach (10) in the second half at Intuit Dome.

Maluach added eight points and six rebounds but dealt with foul trouble, picking up three fouls before halftime. Bouyea struggled early but found a rhythm late in the half, finishing with nine points, two rebounds, and two assists at the break.\n\nDespite limited minutes, Bouyea’s strong finish to the first half suggested he was simply shaking off rust.\n\nThe Suns opened the second half on an 18-0 run, partly by Bouyea’s eight points.

Head coach Paul Jesperson acknowledged their earlier game struggles, especially Bouyea, as Wednesday was his first official night in a Valley Suns uniform.\n\n“We knew there was probably going to be a little fatigue there and a little bit of those guys just having to feel the game out a little bit as it progressed,” he said post-game. “I think [Bouyea] did exactly that. Kind of found his spots, got comfort level [and] got a little energy to him.”\n\nThe Suns finish out the week with a matchup against the Texas Legends on the road on Friday, Jan. 23, at 6:30 p.m.\n\nWM Phoenix Open brings golf to streetwear with Samba shoe collab",

    "fullText": "Silver surged roughly 165% in 2025, driven by industrial shortages and soaring demand.\n\nPeter Schiff argues Bitcoin will mirror silver’s rally—but in reverse, with a sharp collapse.\n\nCrypto supporters dismiss the warning, pointing to Schiff’s long record of failed Bitcoin predictions.\n\nAs silver continues to print record highs, longtime gold advocate and Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff is once again sounding the alarm.\n\nThis time, he is warning that BTC is headed for a collapse that will mirror silver’s rise, only in reverse.\n\nSilver climbed above $94 on Jan. 19, extending a surge that has reshaped the precious metals market over the past year.\n\nSince late 2024, the metal has posted new highs with striking frequency, fueled by tight supply and growing industrial demand.\n\nThe rally has been dramatic. Silver rose about 165% in 2025 and is already up roughly 30% in the first three weeks of 2026 alone, adding an estimated $1.2 trillion in market value.\n\nSchiff seized on the milestone to deliver another stark warning for Bitcoin holders.\n\n“What’s happening with silver is about to happen with Bitcoin, only in reverse,” Schiff wrote on X. “Silver’s spectacular rise will usher in Bitcoin’s catastrophic collapse. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.”\n\nThe comment immediately reignited debate between traditional asset proponents and crypto supporters, a familiar battleground for Schiff, who has spent years criticizing Bitcoin as fundamentally worthless.\n\nSilver’s rally has been driven less by speculation and more by real-world demand pressures.\n\nThe metal plays a critical role in solar panels, electric vehicles, and advanced electronics, sectors that have expanded rapidly as governments and corporations invest heavily in green energy and AI infrastructure.\n\nDemand from data centers and semiconductor manufacturing has further strained supply, creating persistent deficits that have pushed prices higher.\n\nBitcoin, by contrast, has struggled to match silver’s momentum.\n\nDespite a brief rally earlier this month that pushed BTC above $97,000, the asset has failed to sustain a breakout.\n\nBroader market uncertainty, including renewed trade tensions sparked by President Donald Trump’s tariff threats, has kept risk assets under pressure.\n\nWhile Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest through ETFs and ongoing legislative efforts in Washington.\n\nIts growing correlation with equities has limited upside during periods of macro stress.\n\nSchiff’s bearish stance on Bitcoin is hardly new.",

    "description": "Two successfull hedge fund managers sold Amazon and bought a spot Bitcoin ETF in the third quarter.",
    "fullText": "In the third quarter, hedge fund billionaires Philippe Laffont and Steven Schonfeld sold Amazon stock and added to their positions in the iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\nWall Street expects Amazon’s earnings to grow at 19% annually over the next three years, which makes the current valuation of 34 times earnings look fair.\n\nMore companies and institutional investors are buying Bitcoin (or spot Bitcoin ETFs), and that is likely to continue because it is the more popular and most liquid cryptocurrency.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nIn the third quarter, two hedge fund billionaires sold Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and added to positions in the iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: IBIT), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) managed by BlackRock that tracks the spot price of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC).\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management sold 1.4 million shares of Amazon, trimming the position 14%. He also purchased 76,100 shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust, more than doubling his stake.\n\nSteven Schonfeld of Schonfeld Strategic Advisors sold 253,700 shares of Amazon, reducing the position 72%. He also added 1.1 million shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust, increasing his stake 20%.\n\nThe trades are noteworthy because Laffont and Schonfeld outperformed the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) by 94 percentage points and 22 percentage points, respectively, in the last three years. That makes both hedge fund managers good sources of inspiration.\n\nSeveral Wall Street analysts expect Bitcoin to be far more valuable in the future. Tom Lee at Fundstrat Global Advisors says its price could hit $3 trillion in the long run, which implies more than 3,000% upside from where it currently trades at $95,000. Michael Saylor of Strategy says its price could hit $13 million by 2045, implying more than 13,500% upside.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nAmazon has a strong presence in e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing. Building on that advantage, the company has integrated artificial intelligence (AI) products and features across all three business segments to drive revenue growth and improve profit margins.\n\nIn e-commerce, Amazon has developed hundreds of generative AI applications to improve operational efficiency. They automate customer service, optimize demand forecasting, improve inventory placement, and expedite last-mile delivery. Amazon has also developed an AI model called DeepFleet that helps robots navigate warehouses more quickly.\n\nIn cloud computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has launched new foundational models and services, such as Bedrock for generative AI application development. AWS has also introduced AI agents for coding, security, and incident monitoring, and a business intelligence platform called Quick Suite, which leans on generative AI to analyze data, surface insights, and automate workflows.",

    "description": "The price of Bitcoin plunged to $0 on Paradex's perps exchange, leading to a liquidation cascade that required a chain rollback.",
    "fullText": "The price of Bitcoin dropped to $0 on perps decentralized exchange Paradex overnight, according to numerous users, after a database migration issue affected the Paradex blockchain, its block explorer, bridge, and API.\n\nAn issue was first flagged on the Paradex status page at 12:36 a.m, ET on Monday, shortly after social media posts flagged a cascade of liquidations as the price of Bitcoin plunged to $0 on the exchange.\n\nAround 2:00 a.m. ET, the exchange identified the issue and began instituting a fix that resulted in rolling back the state of Paradex Chain, a blockchain built using the Starknet stack. Starknet is an Ethereum layer-2 scaling network.\n\n“We have identified the issue and will be rolling back chain state to block 1604710,” the status update reads. “This is the time before the DB maintenance and is the last known correct state. All accounts will be restored to the state before the DB maintenance. We will provide more updates as we continue with rollback.”\n\nShortly thereafter, Paradex force-cancelled all remaining open orders, and around 5:00 a.m. ET it confirmed that all user funds were safe as its recovery process was ongoing.\n\n“Recovery efforts are ongoing. We can confirm that all user funds are SAFU,” a post on the status page at 5:16 a.m. ET reads.\n\nIt’s still unclear how much the liquidations tallied up to, but data from DeFiLlama indicates that the perps protocol has around $641 million in open interest. The protocol has facilitated around $37 billion in volume over the last 30 days.\n\nAll Paradex services are now operational, according to an update on the status page.\n\nBitcoin Slips On Trade War Fears, Sparks $865M in Liquidations\n\nThe exchange’s price glitch followed a volatile period of trading for BTC, which dropped from more than $95,000 to $92,284 just after 7:00 p.m. on Sunday. The 2% drop in the last 24 hours has eaten into the top crypto asset’s weekly gain, which now stands at 1.4% with BTC recently changing hands at $93,318.\n\nThe slide triggered a growing number of liquidations, which have now extended to more than $875 million over the last 24 hours—$234 million of which can be attributed to Bitcoin, according to data from CoinGlass.",

    "title": "Led by Texas, New Hampshire, states race to prove can –\"Bitcoin on bal sheet\"",
    "description": "Many U.S. states are planning bitcoin strategic reserves, and other forms of crypto financing, showing budgets are buying into the digital assets trend.",
    "fullText": "Led by Texas and New Hampshire, U.S. states across the national map, both red and blue in political stripes, are developing bitcoin strategic reserves and bringing cryptocurrencies onto their books through additional state finance and budgeting measures.\n\nTexas recently became the first state to purchase bitcoin after a legislative effort that began in 2024, but numerous states have joined the \"Reserve Race\" to pass legislation that will allow them to ultimately buy cryptocurrencies.\n\nNew Hampshire passed its crypto strategic reserve law last May, even before Texas, giving the state treasurer the authority to invest up to 5% of the state funds in crypto ETFs, though precious metals such as gold are also authorized for purchase. Arizona passed similar legislation, while Massachusetts, Ohio, and South Dakota have legislation at various stages of committee review.\n\nDespite much of the legislation being largely sponsored or co-sponsored by Republicans, the adoption of crypto at the state level is not expected to strictly fall along party lines. The 2024 election cycle was the first time that the cryptocurrency industry played a major role in lobbying in both state and national elections. In fact, it was the largest corporate donor in an election cycle, with support given to candidates on both sides. It is already amassing a war chest for the 2026 midterms.\n\nCongress is currently debating a crypto market structure bill, and state-level politicians are as much out to prove that they, and their states, won't be left out of the digital assets boom. Justin Marlowe, a public policy professor at the University of Chicago, sees the state-level trend as largely one of signaling at present. \"If you're a governor and you want to broadcast that you are amenable to innovative business development in the digital economy, these are relatively low-cost, low-risk ways to send that signal. That's why we've seen leaders across the ideological spectrum and all over the country take tangible steps in this direction,\" he said.\n\nWhere the state-level crypto efforts can be described as \"bigger steps\" — Marlowe cited Texas, Arizona, and Florida, as examples — he said it has helped to acknowledge the growing political power of crypto advocates in these states.\n\nSimilarities in the actions taken across states to date include include authorizing the state treasurer or other investment official to allow the investment of a limited amount of public funds in crypto and building out the governance structure needed to invest in crypto. This often will involve more frequent reporting requirements and stronger custodial agreements compared to traditional asset classes. The seeding of the reserve can take the form of utilizing cash or government-seized crypto, as in the recent case of the federal government. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a strategic bitcoin reserve last March, but limited the authorization to seized crypto in an effort to show taxpayers would bear no financial burden.\n\nIt is no surprise that Texas was the first state to fund a crypto reserve. Texas has been a crypto hub for years through its role in bitcoin mining. The state's affordable and flexible power, as well as a political environment that has largely been pro-crypto, led Texas in recent years to a sizable position in not just the national, but global bitcoin hashing market.\n\n\"Texas has spent the last few years becoming one of the key centers of bitcoin activity, especially on the mining side,\" said Christian Catalini, founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab, seeing this move as one that early branded the state as \"open for business\" when it comes to digital assets.\n\n\"Once you've made that bet on infrastructure and industry, adding some Bitcoin exposure at the treasury level is a natural next step,\" Catalini said. Such a move essentially makes the state's balance sheet one that is explicitly aligned with the ecosystem it aims to attract.\n\nTexas also has a long history with bitcoin's traditional market competitor: gold.\n\n\"Texas has proven to be a bedrock of government adoption of bitcoin, starting with laws that allow for legal custody arrangements akin to gold storage laws that are well established there,\" said Nik Bhatia, founder of The Bitcoin Layer.\n\nWhen it comes to storing physical gold, Texas has clear rules on storage and ownership, and even the language invoked – vaults, custodians – helps grease the wheels for crypto assets at the state level. The Texas Bullion Depository of 2015, which allowed for state-level depository of bullion and precious metals, was specifically adapted to apply to digital assets like bitcoin. The Texas Bullion Depositary was the first state-administered precious metals depository in the nation.\n\nTexas has not purchased any on-chain bitcoin. After passing the legislation to create a strategic bitcoin reserve that gave authorization to the state comptroller to hold the cryptocurrency, Texas purchased a stake in a bitcoin ETF — roughly $5 million in the largest bitcoin ETF, the BlackRock iShares' Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which since its launch in January 2024 has grown to over $72 billion in assets under management.\n\nThe Comptroller's office made its purchase on the morning of November 20, 2025, when the price of a single bitcoin was $91,336. As of Saturday morning, bitcoin was trading at a little over $95,000.\n\nBhatia said the approval of bitcoin ETFs by the SEC was crucial to the state plans to be comfortable with the holdings under current U.S. securities law. \"Using ETFs is a very clean and safe way to invest in bitcoin, minimizing storage logistical risk and opting for security law protection,\" Bhatia said.\n\nTexas state officials have described this purchase — which deployed only half of the $10 million set aside by the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve — as a \"placeholder\" while security and storage for raw bitcoin can be put into place.\n\nIn addition to the concept of reserve funds, states are bringing crypto into core finance functions, with an approach that balances the inherent trepidation of venturing into new terrain with a desire to be a part of the fast-moving crypto realm.\n\nNew Hampshire, for example, became the first state to approve the issuance of a bitcoin-backed municipal bond last November, a $100 million issuance that would mark the first time cryptocurrency is used as collateral in the U.S. municipal bond market. The deal has not taken place yet, though plans are for the issuance to occur this year. \"The idea is they'll use bitcoin to back a municipal bond issue, the proceeds of which will then be divvied up into loans to smaller governments for economic development projects across the state,\" Marlowe said. Repayment of these loans will recapitalize the fund.\n\nIt is a creative evolution in state finances, but like many of the mechanisms for crypto development at the state level, it utilizes existing financial structures and state goals, according to Marlowe, with similar public bonds in prior decades used for projects like clean water, school upgrades, and other infrastructure. \"What's different here is it's bitcoin rather than taxpayer dollars as the collateral,\" he said.\n\nIn numerous states, including, Colorada, Utah, and Louisiana, crypto is now accepted as payment for taxes and other state business. As more state public finance crypto efforts develop, the shift represents a change in a core philosophy of safety and liquidity that has dominated the investing of state and local funds for centuries.\n\nIn recent decades, assets including real estate and private equity expanded the investment approach of public funds, but crypto represents not only the most recent addition, but the most volatile.\n\n\"For many in the state/local investing industry, crypto-backed assets are still far too speculative and volatile for public money,\" Marlowe said. \"But others, and I think there's a sort of generational shift in the works, see it as a reasonable store of value that is actually stronger on many other public sector values like transparency and asset integrity,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "Ethereum is battle-tested and has successfully stood through the test of time. After navigating through scaling challenges, the first smart contract platform now anchors decentralized finance (DeFi), securing billions.\n\nAfter years of high fees, Ethereum is turning the corner, taking on competing platforms like Solana, attractive because it is very cheap to transact on the mainnet, and near-zero to move value of implement smart contracts on its layer-2s like Arbitrum or sidechains like Polygon.\n\nIn the third week of January, Ethereum is processing more daily transactions than ever before. What’s more? Gas fees is at its lowest levels on record. Meanwhile, the Ethereum price is firm, holding steady above $3,200.\n\nDISCOVER: Best Meme Coin ICOs to Invest in 2026\n\nThis split between increased network activity and price action defines early 2026 theme: People are using Ethereum more, even when prices wobble. Trackers show that Ethereum averaged close to 2.5M transactions per day over the past week, nearly double the activity seen a year ago. The increase in activity is driven by a combination of technical upgrades and a shift in how users interact with the blockchain.\n\nIn late 2025, Ethereum implemented the Fusaka upgrade, allowing layer-2s like Arbitrum and Base to post data to Ethereum much more cheaply. Additionally, the Ethereum block gas limit was raised from 45M to 60M, allowing the base layer to process more transactions per block without causing congestion. From a technical front, the Peer Data Availability Sampling began rolling out, allowing the network to handle more data efficiently.\n\nThe upcoming Glamsterdam fork will further enhance the network, enabling nodes to process independent transactions simultaneously across multiple CPU cores. This effectively turns a single-lane road into a multi-lane superhighway, drastically increasing throughput without risking “state conflicts.” Ethereum developers also plan to make the network more censorship-resistant by reducing the power of “centralized” relays. After this upgrade, the block limit will also increase from the current 60M to over 100M.\n\nAs the mainnet processes more transactions, fees are drastically falling. While it used to cost $50 to $100 to use the network during busy periods, average mainnet fees have dropped to approximately $0.15–$0.20, even as daily transactions hit an all-time high of over 2.5M. Fees are low partly because most intensive apps, including games, are move to layer-2s like Base.",

    "description": "Bitcoin likely already reached its post-halving peak at $126,000 last year, Jefferies' global head of equity strategy wrote in a note.",
    "fullText": "A longtime crypto bull is ditching bitcoin for gold.\n\nChristopher Wood, the global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, said he just cut bitcoin out of his firm's long-term model portfolio, where the token has accounted for around 5%-10% of the portfolio's allocation for the last five years.\n\nThat's because the price of the crypto has likely peaked, but also because there's an existential threat he sees jeopardizing the bitcoin ecosystem: quantum computing.\n\nIn a recent note to clients, Wood pointed specifically to CRQCs, or cryptographically relevant quantum computers — supercomputers that could potentially \"steal\" bitcoin from circulation, he said.\n\nBitcoin transactions are secured with cryptography, a coding system where transactions are encrypted with public keys, and access to the bitcoin itself is controlled by a private key. It would take supercomputers today \"trillions of years\" to derive a private key from a public one, given how complex the computations are, Wood said. But CRQCs could potentially reduce that time to something like several hours to several days, he speculated.\n\nCRQCs don't yet exist, but chatter about the potential risks is already spreading across the bitcoin community, Wood said, pointing to a report from ChainCode Labs that estimated as much as 10 million tokens, or 50% of all bitcoin in circulation, could be accessed by a CRQC.\n\nSome in the crypto community are arguing that the risk from CRQCs means \"vulnerable coins\" in the bitcoin ecosystem should be burned, Wood bited.\n\n\"While GREED & fear does not believe that the quantum issue is about to hit the Bitcoin price dramatically in the near term, the store of value concept is clearly on less solid foundation from the standpoint of a long-term pension portfolio,\" Wood said of his recent portfolio change. He added that he believed bitcoin reached its peak in the post-halving cycle at $126,000 last year.\n\nWood's team has replaced the allocation to bitcoin in the model portfolio with a 10% allocation to gold and gold mining stocks. The portfolio now has a total 45% allocation to physical gold, a 25% allocation to gold mining stocks, and a 30% allocation to Asian equities, excluding Japan.\n\n\"Meanwhile, the existential issue raised by quantum as regards Bitcoin can only be long-term positive for gold since it remains the historically stress tested store of value. Meanwhile, gold is also the best hedge, if not the only one, on the ever-rising geopolitical risks,\" Wood said.\n\nIt's been a rough few months for bitcoin, with the crypto tumbling into a bear market in late 2025 amid a broader risk-off move that was exacerbated by weak liquidity and concerns about the yen-carry trade.\n\nMeanwhile, the case for owning gold has only grown stronger since its stunning rally in 2025. The metal saw its best performance since 1979 and continues to hover near a record high as investors seek protection from geopolitical conflict and inflationary pressures.",

    "title": "Is Bitcoin Heading for a ‘Parabolic Blowoff’ Mirroring Gold? Analysts Weigh In",
    "description": "Analysts debate whether Bitcoin will follow gold's scarcity-driven surge or take a more volatile path due to structural market differences.",
    "fullText": "Bitcoin's exchange-traded funds could be following the exact structural playbook that preceded gold's historic 2025 surge, a parallel that suggests a potential parabolic move awaits the top cryptocurrency.\n\nThe analogy was highlighted by Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matthew Hougan on a podcast with influencer Michael 'Threadguy' Jerome.\n\n\"That’s the same thing that’s happening in Bitcoin,\" Hougan said, pointing to the transformation in gold after central banks began \"panic buying\" following the 2022 Ukraine war sanctions.\n\nCentral bank demand for gold jumped from 400 tons to over 1,000 tons annually starting in 2022. That relentless buying absorbed supply for years before igniting a price explosion: gold closed 2022 down, rallied 13% in 2023, 27% in 2024, and then surged nearly 65% in 2025.\n\n“Eventually, what gold tells you is that sellers run out of ammo. And that’s when the price goes parabolic,” the analyst said.\n\nHe sees the same pattern in Bitcoin ETFs, which have consistently bought more than 100% of the new supply since launch. “So I do think gold has shown what’s going to happen... we’re going to get to that parabolic blowoff move if that buy-side demand continues.”\n\nThis “gold-first, Bitcoin-follows” pattern has been observed before, as highlighted in a previous Decrypt report, where Lawrence Lepard, co-founder of Equity Management Associates, noted “Gold often moves first, and then Bitcoin follows and outperforms.\"\n\nFurthermore, following gold's major rallies, \"a swift rebound shouldn't be the base case,\" Ryan McMillin, chief investment officer at Merkle Tree Capital, previously told Decrypt, suggesting any follow-on move may require patience.\n\nBitcoin Google Searches Hit 11-Month Low as Gold Continues to Climb\n\nOther analysts agree with the high-level premise—that sustained buying absorbs selling pressure—but caution that Bitcoin’s path will have its own distinct volatility and drivers.\n\nTim Sun, senior researcher at HashKey Group, partially agreed with McMillin’s views. \"At a high level, the fact that sustained structural buying absorbs market selling pressure is indeed a core characteristic of any supply-scarce asset entering a long-term bull market,\" he told Decrypt.\n\nHowever, Sun highlighted critical distinctions in market structure.\n\nGold, Silver Hit New Highs as Bitcoin Trades Flat Ahead of Key Macroeconomic Events\n\nFor gold, buyers are typically central banks and sovereign wealth funds seeking a \"hedge against fiat currency credibility,\" resulting in low-leverage, long-term capital. Bitcoin ETF buyers, while institutional, still treat it as a risk asset, leading to \"far higher\" embedded leverage and trading activity.",

    "description": "Ethereum treasury Bitmine Immersion is making a big investment in MrBeast's company, which said last year it would launch a financial services platform.",
    "fullText": "The biggest ethereum holding company in the world is betting big on the digital finance ambitions of one of the world's top online content creators.\n\nTom Lee, the cofounder of global investment advisory firm Fundstrat Global Advisors, announced on Thursday that Bitmine Immersion Technologies is investing $200 million in Beast Industries, the holding company founded by YouTube star MrBeast.\n\nJimmy Donaldson, better known by his social media moniker, announced plans to launch a financial services platform in December, and Lee said on Thursday that he believes it will play a pivotal role in one of the financial sector's fastest-growing markets.\n\nBeast Industries CEO Jeff Housenbold also hinted at a future partnership, saying in a statement: \"We look forward to exploring ways to further collaborate and incorporate DeFi into our upcoming financial services platform.\"\n\nIn June 2025, Lee led Bitmine's strategic pivot from operating as a bitcoin miner to becoming the world's largest ethereum treasury, helping usher in last year's investor craze for digital asset holding strategies.\n\n\"MrBeast and Beast Industries, in our view, is the leading content creator of our generation, with a reach and engagement unmatched with Gen Z, Gen Alpha and Millennials,\" he said. \"Beast Industries is the largest and most innovative creator based platform in the world and our corporate and personal values are strongly aligned.\"\n\nLee said on CNBC that he sees his bet on Beast Industries as a rising player in a broader movement to tokenize assets on the blockchain.\n\n\"Digitalization of not only dollars, but stocks and equities, is going to take place and over time, that really blurs what is a service versus what's digital money,\" he added. \"That's where a collaboration and investment into Beast Industries makes sense.\"\n\nCompanies such as Robinhood have recently embraced asset tokenization, viewing it as a way to offer investors exposure to companies that might still be private or to allow investors to more easily trade hard assets like real estate.\n\nBeast Industries, for its part, has been laying the groundwork for a financial services venture for a while. In a pitch deck shared in early 2025, which was viewed by Business Insider, it described customized offerings that would target MrBeast's audience, supported by financial literacy content. The deck listed nine potential offerings, including student loans, insurance, and credit insights. It said the company would launch by partnering with a fintech company to leverage its existing infrastructure \"while avoiding regulatory, credit risk, and capital requirement.\"\n\nDonaldson has also said he's looking to build a financial literacy-focused channel.\n\nBeast Industries took in over $400 million in revenue in 2024, according to investor materials viewed by Business Insider. The company lost money last year, mainly because of high costs in its media business. Recently, the company has been on a cost-cutting push as it looks to reduce media-related losses.\n\nIn 2025, the social media star sought to raise $200 million to extend a $300 million Series C round he'd raised in 2024 at a $5 billion valuation, according to investment materials viewed by Business Insider.\n\nDonaldson's company has been pitching investors on the idea of building the \"next Disney.\" Like Disney, Beast Industries is looking to expand well beyond video into different product categories.",

    "description": "A crypto token promoted by Eric Adams is linked to Sefi Zvieli, a landlord whose Brooklyn property became a city-backed homeless shelter.",
    "fullText": "A cryptocurrency promoted this week by former New York City mayor Eric Adams spiked in value before rapidly losing most of its gains, and is connected to a landlord who previously secured a lucrative city-backed homeless shelter deal after hiring a lawyer with close ties to Adams.\n\nAdams told journalists Monday morning that the \"NYC Token\" project would generate money to fund blockchain education for underserved New Yorkers and fight antisemitism and \"anti-Americanism.\"\n\nHe didn't say how, or specify who he was working with, but said he wasn't drawing a salary yet.\n\nThe project's website mentions an entity called C18 Digital LLC in its terms of service. An entity with that name was formed in Delaware on December 30. The certificate of formation was signed by Sefi Zvieli.\n\nThe City, a nonprofit news outlet, reported in 2023 that Zvieli avoided foreclosure on a \"filthy, fetid, and dangerous\" block of student housing he owned in Brooklyn by inking a deal to rent it to a New York City-financed nonprofit as a homeless shelter for $3.5 million a year.\n\nThe story said he snagged the deal after hiring Frank Carone, a lawyer with close ties to Adams, after Adams had won the New York City mayoral election but before he was sworn in as mayor. Zvieli has also been listed in public records for various New York companies and has been described by Israeli news outlets as a hotel investor.\n\nIt's unclear what role Zvieli played in NYC Token beyond signing the formation papers. He didn't reply to an email address listed for him in website registration records. Carone didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe token's trading history showed what happened in the hours after Adams plugged it: After peaking around 50 cents per token, its price fell to less than 9 cents per token. It has since risen to around 13 cents per token.\n\nSocial media users who said they had purchased the coin expressed outrage, accusing Adams or people affiliated with the project of stealing funds. The crypto analytics company Bubblemaps said in posts on X that a wallet withdrew $2.5 million of sales proceeds from a liquidity pool associated with NYC Token shortly before its value collapsed, before putting about $1.5 million back.\n\nElissa Buchter, a spokesperson for NYC Token, said in an email that the token's backers were not responsible for its wild performance.\n\n\"Our market maker made adjustments in an attempt to keep trading running smoothly, and as part of this process, moved liquidity,\" she said in an email. \"The team has not sold any tokens and is subject to lockups and transfer restrictions. THE TEAM HAS NOT WITHDRAWN ANY MONEY FROM THE ACCOUNT.\"\n\nA spokesman for Adams shared a statement in which Adams denied profiting from the token's launch, said he didn't personally invest in the token, and said \"no money was taken out of NYC Token.\"\n\n\"The NYC Token was designed as a free, voluntary way to support educational and nonprofit efforts,\" said the spokesman, Todd Shapiro. \"Claims suggesting otherwise are inaccurate.\"\n\nAs mayor, Adams was friendly with some figures in the cryptocurrency industry and converted some of his paychecks to bitcoin. In interviews on Monday, he twice referred to blockchains, the technology that acts as a ledger for many digital asset transactions, as \"blockchange.\"\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the NYC Token, it's so far faring better than \"NYCCoin,\" a token that Adams boosted early in his mayoralty. Trading on that dried up, and it was reportedly disavowed by the city and delisted by its main exchange in 2023.",
