    "description": "MSCI could exclude crypto treasury firms from its widely followed indexes. The move is drawing sharp criticism from industry players.",
    "fullText": "A possible move by indexing giant MSCI to exclude crypto treasury companies from its widely followed indexes is drawing fierce backlash from the industry.\n\nMSCI is considering excluding companies that have 50% or more of their assets invested in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. The index provider announced the plans in October, with a decision on the move potentially to come in January.\n\nMSCI argues that crypto treasury companies are more like investment funds than operating companies. The idea has drawn opposition from Michael Saylor's Strategy, as well as Viek Ramaswamy's Strive Asset Management.\n\nBitcoin prices have been volatile lately, with the potential for fresh struggles among companies that accumulate crypto being eyed as another headwind for the market.\n\nCrypto market players told Business Insider they see MSCI's move as a mistake.\n\nAdam Levine, CEO of digital asset infrastructure firm Fireblocks, said that MSCI's plan likely won't play well with institutional investors that have warmed to digital assets in recent years, and who could be forced to rebalance their holdings that track the index.\n\n\"When major indexes leave out companies that work with digital assets in a meaningful way, they're introducing the potential of missing key market players at a time when more businesses are innovating with stablecoins and tokenized equity,\" he stated. \"It's equivalent to intentionally ignoring early internet companies 30 years ago.\"\n\nWhile the implications for DATs could be severe if MSCI decides to exclude them from its indexes, sources say bitcoin can still recover from its bear market.\n\nWojciech Kaszycki, chief strategy officer at blockchain infrastructure firm BTCS S.A., predicts that a bitcoin rebound is coming, and others say MSCI's potential move has been baked into the market's outlook already.\n\n\"Decisions by MSCI and other index providers have real implications for digital asset treasuries and, by extension, the underlying crypto they hold,\" said Spencer Hallarn, head of OTC trading at crypto market maker GSR. \"That said, this potential move has been well telegraphed, so it's reasonable to assume the market has already priced it in and that it's unlikely to come as a surprise.\"",

    "description": "These flows represent a bullish bet on volatility rather than a downside hedge or outright bearish position.",
    "fullText": "Deep out-of-the-money (OTM) bitcoin (BTC) put options are lighting up in longer-dated expiries, as traders pick up cheap lottery tickets for potential moonshot payoffs if BTC swings wild.\n\nOn leading crypto options exchange Deribit, the $20,000 strike put is the second most popular among the June 2026 expiry options, boasting a notional open interest of over $191 million.\n\nNotional open interest is the dollar value of the number of active contracts. Put options at strikes below the going market rate of BTC are said to be OTM. These OTM puts tend to be cheaper than those near or above the spot price of BTC.\n\nThe June expiry also sees significant activity in other OTM puts at $30,000, $40,000, $60,000, and $75,000 strikes.\n\nActivity in deep OTM puts is typically read as traders bracing for a price crash. But that's not necessarily the case here, as the exchange has also seen activity on higher-strike calls above $200,000.\n\nTaken together, these flows represent a bullish view on long-dated volatility at low cost rather than a bet on price direction, according to Deribit's Global Head of Retail Sidrah Fariq. Think of it as cheap lottery tickets on a potential volatility explosion over the next six months.\n\n\"There is about 2,117 open interest on the $20K bitcoin put for the June expiry. We also saw some big trades in the $30,000 put and $230,000 call strikes. The combination of these far out of the money options does not suggest directional trading, but rather deep wing trades that professionals use to trade long-dated volatility cheaply and adjust tail risk in their books,\" Fariq told CoinDesk.\n\nShe explained that it's essentially volatility positioning, not price positioning, because the $20,000 put or the $230,000 call are simply too far from the spot price to be a purely protective hedge. As of writing, BTC changed hands near $90,500, according to CoinDesk data.\n\nThose holding both OTM calls and puts could score asymmetric payoffs from extreme volatility or wild price swings in either direction. But if markets stay flat, these options quickly lose value.\n\nOptions are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A put option provides the right to sell and represents a bearish bet on the market. A call offers the right to buy.\n\nThe crypto options market, including the one tied to BlackRock's IBIT ETF, has evolved into a sophisticated arena where institutions and whales engage in three-dimensional chess, managing risk and profiting from price direction, time decay, and volatility swings.\n\nBroadly speaking, the options market mood appears bearish, as BTC puts continue to trade at a premium to calls across all tenors, according to Amberdata's options risk reversals. This is at least partly due to persistent call overwriting, a strategy aimed at boosting yield on top of spot market holdings.",
