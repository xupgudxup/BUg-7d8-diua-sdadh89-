    "title": "I made 3 Buffalo chicken dip recipes. The best used Costco's $5 rotisserie chicken.",
    "description": "I made Buffalo chicken dip using recipes from three celebrity chefs. The best version uses five ingredients, including Costco rotisserie chicken.",
    "fullText": "There's nothing better than making a warm, creamy Buffalo chicken dip when I'm hosting guests.\n\nSo, I tried recipes from celebrity chefs Trisha Yearwood, Pat Neely, and Claire Robinson to see which famous figure had the tastiest dip.\n\nHere's how each one stacked up.\n\nYearwood's recipe called for more fresh ingredients than the others, which I appreciated.\n\nHowever, this also meant the recipe was more labor-intensive, as it required dicing a whole onion and simmering chicken breasts in hot sauce for about an hour.\n\nIt also called for vegetable oil, garlic, hot sauce, sour cream, olive-oil mayonnaise, shredded cheddar cheese, green onions, and blue-cheese crumbles.\n\nYearwood also suggested cutting up celery and carrots to dip into the finished dish.\n\nPer Yearwood's instructions, I cooked the onions in a pan and added the thinly sliced chicken breasts, garlic, a cup of water, and half a cup of hot sauce.\n\nI simmered the chicken in hot sauce for about an hour, but after trying a piece, I didn't think this gave the meat that much flavor. All the work seemed a little redundant when the recipe called for adding more hot sauce to the mayo mixture anyway.\n\nOnce the chicken had simmered, I combined this mixture with the sour cream, mayo, cheddar, and a quarter cup of blue cheese.\n\nI thought the directions took an odd turn when they said to serve the dip \"with the chicken\" in step four. I followed the comments-section consensus and mixed the chicken into the dip before topping it with the remaining blue cheese and green onions.\n\nThe mix of freshly cooked chicken and cold ingredients created a room-temperature dip.\n\nThe familiar flavor combo of Frank's RedHot sauce and blue cheese was present, but the dip wasn't spicy. I could see it working in a Buffalo-chicken-salad sandwich if it were a little less chunky.\n\nGiven all the demands of hosting a party, I think spending more than an hour on a dip that's supposed to be served immediately — but isn't even hot — would be inefficient.\n\nNeely's recipe was the simplest of the three, relying mostly on dried seasonings and canned chicken breast.\n\nThe recipe called for cream cheese, sour cream, dried parsley, Cajun seasoning, onion powder, hot sauce, canned chicken, and shredded cheddar cheese.\n\nNeely's recipe also notes that the dip can be made ahead of time and stashed in the fridge, which seemed pretty convenient.\n\nI started by adding the cream cheese, sour cream, hot sauce, and seasonings to my mixer. I used a stand mixer because Neely used one, though you could probably make the dip without this equipment.\n\nWhen I was done mixing, I was hit with the unmistakable smell of onion dip, which was surprising.\n\nNevertheless, I continued to fold in the chicken and shredded cheese and spooned the mixture into casserole dishes. I sprinkled the rest of the cheese on top and baked the dip in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes.\n\nFlavor-wise, this dip was the boldest of the three, but it strayed from the familiar Buffalo-wing taste I'm used to. The Cajun seasoning and hot sauce also made this the spiciest dip by a wide margin.\n\nIt was intense enough to risk numbing my guests' mouths before the main course, so I'd go lighter on the seasoning next time.\n\nNeely's dip was also the loosest and least chicken-heavy of the three recipes, so it seemed like it would be best served alongside heartier dishes.\n\nRobinson's recipe called for the fewest ingredients of the three, requiring only a rotisserie chicken (which I purchased from Costco), cream cheese, crumbled blue cheese, chopped celery, and hot sauce.\n\nPreparing the chicken for this recipe was hardly the neatest. Outside the greasy process of pulling apart the chicken, though, it was a very straightforward recipe.\n\nLike Neely's, the recipe said the dip could be prepared ahead of time.\n\nRobinson's recipe called for softening the cream cheese on the stove over medium heat, but the cold block scalded at that temperature. I lowered the temperature so it could slowly melt, and from there, the process was easy.\n\nI mixed in the chicken pieces, chopped celery, and hot sauce, transferred the dip to a casserole dish, covered it with crumbled blue cheese, and baked it at 425 degrees for 25 minutes.\n\nThe recipe made enough to fill a 9-inch pie pan, but I separated mine into smaller portions.\n\nRobinson's chicken-heavy recipe was true to the classic flavor of Buffalo dip, with just enough spice to keep everyone happy.\n\nThe chopped celery, which I figured would get lost, provided a surprising amount of texture and a bit of color, and the moist, dark-chicken meat didn't dry out while baking.\n\nThis dip was so meaty that I think it could be served as an alternative to chicken wings.\n\nRobinson's was the clear winner among the three dips. Though I could see myself dipping a crusty piece of bread into it, it was also hearty enough that it felt like a main dish.\n\nPlus, there's something very football-friendly about being able to advertise a whole-chicken Buffalo dip to your guests.\n\nClick to check out the other celebrity-chef recipes we've put head-to-head so far.\n\nThis story was originally published on February 7, 2024, and most recently updated on February 6, 2026.",

    "description": "After traveling North America, there's only one place I wish I could move to and live full-time: Montreal. I love the food, vibe, and infrastructure.",
    "fullText": "As someone who has spent several years galavanting around the United States, Central America, and Europe, there are very few cities that truly humble me.\n\nBut from the moment I stepped off the plane in Montreal, a feeling of serendipity washed over me. By the end of my visit, I couldn't believe how much I'd fallen for the Canadian city.\n\nFor the first time, I found myself pulling up rental prices and researching how long I could legally stay in a place before I'd even left.\n\nSomehow, Montreal felt like it was meant for me.\n\nWhen it gets dark, the energy here feels palpable — and I found locals can really party in style. Even as a solo female traveler, I felt at home chatting up bartenders, patrons, and night owls on trains back to my Airbnb.\n\nThe two-in-one delight that is Pub Saint Pierre and Barrelmans Bar in Old Town was my first stop. The handcrafted cocktails and simply wondrous tapas menu were hits. I still think about the potato mille-feuille with garlic butter and goat cheese I ordered — if you see it on the menu, you must try it.\n\nAtwater Cocktail Club, which has been regularly featured in Canada's top 10 bars for years, was astounding. The cleverly constructed drinks and refined French-inspired small plates and comfort dishes left me feeling impressed.\n\nAnd, of course, there's plenty of fun to be had at wine bars in the area.\n\nMy two favorites are Rouge Gorge, where I've experienced incredible service and spot-on recommendations, and Casavant, which has incredibly romantic date-night vibes.\n\nMontreal might not be the first place people name when they list global food capitals, but it should be.\n\nSure, you've got the Canadian classics like poutine: crispy fries smothered in rich gravy and topped with melty cheese curds that squeak with every bite.\n\nAnd then there are the iconic Montreal-style bagels from Fairmount and St-Viateur; slightly sweeter, with a perfect chewable crust.\n\nBut beyond the staples that make Canadian food stellar, Montreal is quietly crushing it on its international cuisine. For one, I'm still thinking about the flavorful, incredible Venezuelan arepas I had from Arepera.\n\nOf course, no visit to the city is complete without a stop at Jean-Talon Market, which is open year-round. Here you'll find local honey and maple syrup to bring home, amazing seafood stalls, and fresh veggies and fruits that burst with color and flavor.\n\nIt felt easy to picture myself eating my way around the city for weeks without ever getting bored.\n\nI loved how easy it was for me to get around Montreal.\n\nBeyond being fairly walkable with many smooth sidewalks, the local public-transit system truly shines.\n\nWhether I was taking the bus or the metro, stations I stopped at felt clean with well-labeled signs and maps. I never once got lost while navigating the city.\n\nComing from Los Angeles, where public transit feels like a work in progress, this felt like a breath of fresh air. Plus, not having to drive or sit in traffic is the dream.\n\nThough I'm sure living in Montreal has its drawbacks, the pros seem quite compelling: incredible food, rich culture, and strong public infrastructure, to name a few.\n\nPlus, Canada as a whole has some appealing perks, like unviersal healthcare, a more relaxed pace, and a pretty welcoming attitude … even if it gets a little chillier than I'm used to.\n\nMontreal just feels livable. There always seems to be something to do in the city — outdoor exhibits, a massive yearly summer Fringe Festival, winter carnivals, and so much more.\n\nTo me, it doesn't just feel like a place you just pass through; it feels like one where you can build a life.\n\nBut there's a catch. Recently, Canada tightened some of its visa options, especially for digital nomads and self-employed individuals. With many of those programs suspended, getting long-term access without an in-demand skill set is tough.\n\nAs a freelance journalist and content creator, that's a frustrating barrier, especially for a city that feels so inclusive. Still, I'm not giving up on the idea. Whether it's short-term stints or long weekends, I already know I'll be back.\n\nMontreal has officially joined the short list of places that feel like they could be home, even if, for now, just in spirit.",

    "description": "The Olympic Village in Milan offers plenty of perks and amenities for athletes, including free food, stress plants and beds that are not made of cardboard.",
    "fullText": "The Olympic Village rises above the security fences that surround it, a collection of structures both temporary and permanent where the athletes will reside over the next two-plus weeks at the Milan-Cortina Games.\n\nOut on the sidewalk and behind barriers, lookie-loos crane their necks for a peek at the competitors, while pin traders mill through the churning crowd in hopes of making a souvenir swap.\n\nBut what’s it like inside the Village, where the medal hopefuls work out, mingle and relax before some of the biggest moments of their young lives?\n\n“The best part is the food,” said Micah Moore, bobsledder from Trinidad and Tobago, echoing what people have said for centuries about Italy. “Nutrition is so important. And everything you see is free.”\n\nAh, yes, gratis. That’s a common theme in the Olympic Village, where corporate sponsors of the Games have gotten creative with their free goods and services — and swag bags — for the athletes.\n\nThere are multiple rooms devoted to gaming, with virtual-reality glasses over here, and “Call of Duty” over there, and overstuffed chairs and couches everywhere. There are the typical role-playing video games, along with virtual tennis and dirtbike riding, but conspicuously absent are any winter sports. Organizers explain the rooms are meant to be an escape from that all-encompassing world.\n\nSpeaking of escapes, Corona Cero — the non-alcoholic version of that beer — has constructed a pair of round, glass-roofed wooden structures that feel like part-ski lodge, part-yurt and are filled with plants and comfortable seats and soft music where the athletes can kick back with a chilled beverage. (It has been mild weather for a Milan winter.)\n\nThere are rolled-up yoga mats in the corner, and a chalkboard outside lists times for a breathwork class with Sarah, a soundbath session with Guilia, and restorative yoga and meditation in the afternoon.\n\nNot far away, and made of similar wood, is a wagon labeled the Cero (“zero”) Stress Plant Shop. There, an athlete can adopt a houseplant for the duration of his or her stay, nurturing it for a couple weeks before it’s donated to a local charity, perhaps for auction. The competitor is given a pack of seeds upon departure to grow the same plant at home.\n\nFour-time Olympian Madison Chock said she was “pleasantly surprised” the competitors could foster plants. She said the plant that she shares with husband/ice dance partner Evan Bates is named “Stenry,” a combination of their dogs’ names, Stella and Henry. She said the plant is thriving, although she doesn’t know the variety, only that it’s dangly and has leaves that cascade down like a waterfall.\n\nOf course, sitting around and watching plants grow can get a little dull. This week, the arriving athletes seemed more interested in getting accustomed to their free Samsung phones and using their own hand gestures to direct a robotic hand behind glass to pick up a plastic ball encasing a mystery Olympic pin. The AI demonstration by Alibaba Cloud is a futuristic version of those arcade games where you maneuver a metal claw to grab a stuffed animal.\n\nThe Olympics is filled with young, beautiful athletes, so it’s no wonder two of the more popular pop-ups in the Village provide skin and haircare products and services. KIKO Milano has cosmetic stations where athletes can schedule makeup appointments — very popular before the Opening Ceremonies — and Procter & Gamble has built a “Champions Clubhouse” for scalp massages, hair washing and styling, along with barbers for personalized shaving and beard care.\n\nThere are P&G swag bags of course — some athletes arrived without any toiletries — and KIKO engraves complimentary tubes of lipstick with the names of competitors.\n\nCoca-Cola takes that engraving process a step further with a machine that snaps a photo of the user, then embosses that picture onto the iconic red can of soda.\n\nBeyond the keepsakes, the Olympic organizers have gotten an essential right in the Village. Gone are the flimsy cardboard bedframes of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, held during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThere was speculation at the time that those beds were designed to discourage casual sex among the competitors because the frames would break apart at the slightest provocation. Organizers brushed off those rumors, heralding the beds as sturdy and eco-friendly.\n\nRegardless, when she arrived at this year’s Olympic Village, Britain figure skater Phebe Bekker posted a Tik-Tok video from her room that answered a popular question among the athletes, many of whom found the cardboard beds uncomfortable.\n\n“We’re looking good,” she said, knocking on her wooden bedframe and testing the mattress. “Heard it here first, there are no cardboard beds, as far as I know.”\n\nJust like the slogan of that popular soft drink. It’s the real thing.\n\nStaff writer Thuc Nhi Nguyen contributed to this report.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Super Bowl recipes like creamy queso, Buffalo chicken wings, meatballs, and mac and cheese can all be made in a slow cooker.",
    "fullText": "In a bid to find simple Super Bowl party foods that didn't require hours in the kitchen, I decided to test out five slow-cooker recipes.\n\nI've made classics like Buffalo chicken dip countless times in my Crock-Pot, but this time I branched out with options like spicy wings, meatballs, and mac and cheese.\n\nEvery dish impressed me, though the wings were the clear MVP.\n\nHere's how I made the game-day appetizers in a slow cooker.\n\nThese meatballs by Chef Savvy are super versatile: You can serve them on their own with tomato sauce, in a roll for a delicious meatball sub, or with pasta. The ingredients for the meatballs are pretty standard — I used a meatball mix from the grocery store that included beef and pork.\n\nIt's best to mix the ingredients by hand in the bowl to ensure the eggs, breadcrumbs, and meat are well incorporated.\n\nI could see the chopped onion and parsley peeking through the meat mixture. The recipe that I followed said you should have about 24 meatballs — I had that exact number, so I was confident that my meatballs were the right size.\n\nNext, I broiled the meatballs in the oven for about four minutes on each side, careful not to burn them.\n\nI then started gathering the ingredients for the tomato sauce: crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, bay leaves, red pepper flakes, and Italian seasoning.\n\nIt's OK if the meatballs are placed on top of each other if your slow cooker is slightly smaller.\n\nAfter adding my tomato sauce ingredients, I set the slow cooker on low for four hours, as per the recipe. However, when I pulled out my first meatball at the four-hour mark, I thought it looked a little underdone. It's important to check your meatballs before eating them, as there can be variations in the cooking time depending on the size of your meatballs or even your slow cooker.\n\nI let mine continue cooking for another half-hour on high to make sure everything was done for dinner time.\n\nI thought the meatballs were perfectly juicy and well-seasoned, while the tomato sauce tasted like homemade marinara that had been cooking on the stove for hours.\n\nI enjoyed the meatballs on their own as an appetizer. However, later in the week, I served some of the leftover meatballs and sauce with pasta for dinner, which really impressed me as well.\n\nI started by mixing together Buffalo sauce, minced garlic, chopped yellow onion, and brown sugar.\n\nWhile I had heard you could make Buffalo wings in a slow cooker, I was admittedly skeptical. I was nervous that the wings wouldn't turn out crispy enough, since that's usually done in a traditional oven or a fryer.\n\nHowever, Spend With Pennies' recipe called for broiling the wings after cooking them in the slow cooker, which would crisp them in just a few minutes.\n\nThe chicken wings that I bought didn't have the drumsticks and flats separated, which added a bit of time to my preparation.\n\nAfter they were fully cooked, I removed them from the slow cooker and placed them on a sheet pan with foil.\n\nI then brushed some of the Buffalo sauce still in the slow cooker over the wings. I then put them under the broiler for about three minutes on each side until they were crispy and slightly blackened.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by how easy these wings were to make, and loved how the slow cooker made the wings extremely tender.\n\nThe wings were crispy on the outside, while the meat inside was tender, juicy, and moist. I also thought they were the perfect spice level — they had a kick but didn't set my mouth on fire.\n\nI thought these would fit in well at any game-day or Super Bowl party.\n\nI've tried a number of Martha Stewart's slow-cooker recipes in the past, and I've enjoyed a majority of them. I was excited to see how Stewart's queso dip recipe would turn out.\n\nLike a lot of her slow-cooker recipes, this dip only required a few ingredients, which I really appreciated when it came to braving the grocery store a week before Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nI started by adding American cheese and pepper jack cheese to the slow cooker and mixed it with a small amount of cornstarch.\n\nI mixed it until it was creamy and then seasoned it with salt.\n\nYou'll know it's done when the dip is bubbling and slightly thickened.\n\nI added sliced jalapeños, red onion, and cilantro.\n\nI thought the pepper jack and American cheeses meshed well together, while the tomatoes and green chilies added a lot of flavor. I really liked the texture of the dip — it wasn't too thick or too watery.\n\nI also really liked how this dip only called for a few ingredients. It would definitely make life a lot easier when cooking for a group of people on Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nThe celebrity chef shared her recipe for slow-cooker macaroni and cheese in her cookbook, \"Martha Stewart's Slow Cooker.\"\n\nThe recipe calls for three cups of white sharp cheddar cheese and one cup of Gruyere, which creates the sauce. The third and final cheese in this recipe, Parmigiano Reggiano, is added to the breadcrumb mixture later.\n\nI softened the chopped onion with a tablespoon of butter.\n\nAfter mixing the ingredients with the uncooked macaroni, simply leave the slow cooker to cook on high.\n\nTo make the breadcrumbs, the recipe instructed me to pulse two slices of bread in a food processor. I then toasted the breadcrumb pieces on the stove for a few minutes until they were golden brown.\n\nI thought that the three different kinds of cheese, especially the smoked Gruyere, made for a complex flavor profile, while the onions added a savory flavor to the dish.\n\nThe base for the Buffalo chicken dip by Taste of Home calls for crumbled blue cheese, cream cheese, sour cream, and ranch dressing.\n\nI mixed those ingredients in a medium-sized bowl before spreading the dip in a single layer in the bottom of my slow cooker.\n\nYou can use rotisserie chicken or simply boil up some chicken breasts and shred them yourself with a fork, like I did.\n\nI could already tell this dip was going to be delicious.\n\nI set the slow cooker to warm and began prepping my toppings. I added another layer of American cheese and put the lid on the slow cooker to allow the cheese to melt. Then, I chopped up one green onion and added it to the top.\n\nThe layers of the dip were perfectly proportioned. With each bite, I got a delicious mouthful of cheese, hot sauce, and chicken. This recipe really impressed me, and I would definitely make it again.",

    "fullText": "What stemmed from a 10-day trip to Hong Kong in 2009 to visit my then-boyfriend blossomed into a love story with Asia.\n\nOn my first foray into the East, I landed bright-eyed, eager, and entirely clueless. My welcome meal — a dim sum feast — was a revelation. With my now-husband and 10 of his newest friends, we encircled a table piled with dozens of steamer baskets filled with dimpled sweet buns, flaky taro puffs, braised meats, crispy-bottomed dumplings, and more.\n\nIgnoring my lack of chopsticks experience, I dove in, unsteadily maneuvering a still-steaming bun toward my plate. My finger slipped. And the pastry, in all its custard-filled rotundness, plopped into my teacup, forming a geyser of hot liquid that sprayed those around me.\n\nMortified, I vowed to use chopsticks at every meal until I mastered them. Seventeen years in, it has shaped my sense of self and defined my career as a food journalist.\n\nTraversing epicurean-fueled travels, here are three gastronomic destinations I recommend to fellow travelers, and one I don't, despite the fanfare surrounding it.\n\nFrom bustling street stalls to iconic hole-in-the-wall gems, Thailand's culinary landscape has pulled me in a dozen times over.\n\nBeyond the conventional pad thai and mango sticky rice, there's a deep-rooted legacy of punchy flavors, best washed down with a frothy glass of silky-sweet Thai milk tea.\n\nOne of my most memorable encounters happened by chance, when I ducked into a small storefront to escape a sudden downpour. Distracted by the rain, I almost missed the bubbling stockpot, until the sight of Lung Cheay's signature egg noodles snapped me back to attention. Beloved by those in the know for its dry tom yum, topped with succulent barbecued pork and soft-boiled eggs, the shop is a classic Thai rags-to-riches story. The line that now snakes down the block is worlds away from its humble beginnings as a pushcart.\n\nOther bites I never miss during a visit to Bangkok span melt-in-your-mouth, marinated seafood smothered in a sour and spicy herb sauce at Pa Nee Kung Chae Nam Pla, fried chicken liberally caked in crisped garlic cloves at Polo Fried Chicken, and late-night pilgrimages to Talad Noi Crab Fried Rice overflowing with carb god devotees praying away tomorrow's impending hangover.\n\nI first visited Ho Chi Minh City, or Saigon, in 2017 and returned three more times that year alone. The city reflects historical influences from China, Cambodia, France, and the US, culminating in a distinctly southern-style Vietnamese cuisine that bridges bold flavors, ferments, and fresh herbs.\n\nStreet food forms the backbone of Saigon, with carts feeding the ebb and flow of passersby like blood pumping to the beat of the city's pulsating heart. As evening marches into night, city corners transform into impromptu eateries, with portable tables, plastic stools, and motorbikes abound.\n\nI've done my fair share of devouring in this street-food mecca. There's Bún Thịt Nướng — Nguyễn Trung Trực, a no-frills, 30-year-old stall known for heaping bowls of vermicelli topped with grilled pork, crisp egg rolls, pickles, and a bouquet of herbs.\n\nThen there's Bún Cá Xe Dẩy, a late-night vendor ladling steaming bowls of canh chua — a tangy pineapple, tamarind, and tomato soup laced with fried fish. And at Xíu Mại chén Đèn Dầu, springy Vietnamese-style meatballs are served in a fragrant broth, with a crusty baguette on the side for dipping.\n\nRegardless of how many times I visit, there's always another miniature plastic chair flanking a buzzing back-alley pop-up waiting for me to take a seat.\n\nMost famous for turning the spice dial up to an 11 through Sichuan peppercorn flakes that vibrate against your lips long after the meal concludes and seemingly innocuous bites that still register on the Scoville scale, eating in Chengdu is an all-out heat offensive.\n\nIt's also my go-to for Chinese culinary travel.\n\nWhile wontons are ubiquitous within China, only in Chengdu will you find hongyou chaoshou (red oil wontons). Coated in chile oil, these crescent-shaped pockets of joy are omnipresent, each spot tweaking the recipe ever-so-slightly to cause a ripple in the die-hard fandom of one wonton shop over the next.\n\nWarming bowls of wontons sprinkled with friendly shopkeeper chitchat earmark my annual pilgrimages to China's spice capital.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, tianshuimian (sweet water noodles) spotlight Sichuan's signature guaiwei, or \"strange flavor\" — a seasoning that folds spicy, salty, sesame, sour, and sweet into a single bite. Cord-like, al dente noodles are swaddled in dark and light soy sauce, chile oil, sesame and garlic pastes, crushed peanuts, Sichuan peppercorns, and brown sugar syrup, forming a gravy that varnishes each strand with an addictive, lip-tingling heat.\n\nSitting with a brimming bowlful of bland noodles in Tokyo, I've been left with frustration rather than fulfillment more times than I care to recount. Japan, as a whole, struggles with excess hype and over-tourism resulting from a fetishization of its culture.\n\nIt's in vogue to collect kawaii memorabilia, swap coffee for matcha, and recount every Miyazaki movie ever made. I even have an anime bowl of ramen tattooed on my arm. (Zero regrets)\n\nTokyo is the epicenter of that trendiness.\n\nOften miscast as the pinnacle of Japanese cuisine, Tokyo tempts visitors, myself included, into chasing viral ramen shops, jiggly pancake cafés, and so-called must-visit markets — places popularized by social media, complete with long waits and inflated prices that rarely justify the hype.\n\nWhile this dynamic exists in many international cities, I find it far more blatant in Tokyo.\n\nThis is in no way a dig at Japanese food; it's one of my favorite cuisines. From thick fillets of bonito seared over dried straw flames in Kochi Prefecture to bubbling streetside vats of oden in Osaka —daikon, tofu, and fish cakes simmered in an aromatic broth — my travels across Japan have almost always left me deeply satisfied.\n\nBut in Tokyo, specifically, I often struggle as an outsider to distinguish between what's genuinely great and what's merely hyped.\n\nStill, with Tokyo as my neighbor, there's always room for a new chapter in my Asian food love saga.",

    "fullText": "Selling Chicago-style pizza outside of Chicago has always been a challenge.\n\nAs someone who grew up near Boston, a city with a grand tradition of thinner-crust pizza offered by chains such as Pizzeria Regina, Papa Gino's, and Santarpio's, deep-dish pizza seemed like an entirely different food. It wasn't something commonly sold during my childhood, and it remains something I've never really considered pizza.\n\nDespite that, Uno Pizzeria, which was known as Pizzeria Uno back in the 1980s and 90s, flourished in New England. The chain offered a version of deep-dish pizza that was a take on the Chicago classic, but also closer to traditional pizza.\n\nIt was deep-dish, but not quite as deep as what's traditionally sold under that name. You could eat it with a fork and knife, but you could also pick it up and eat it as a slice.\n\nUno did not exactly take over New England, but it became a steady presence with dozens of locations across the region. That presence has slowly withered, as the overall chain has shrunk from over 150 locations nationwide to only 36 as of Feb. 3, 2026, according to the locations page on the company's website.\n\nNow, the chain has suddenly closed three more Massachusetts locations.\n\nUno Pizzeria has closed locations in Dedham, Revere, and Braintree, Massachusetts, without any notification to customers, Boston's WCVB reported.\n\nThe chain posted a notice on its Facebook page, which has since been taken down.\n\n“After 34 years of serving this amazing community, our Revere location is closing its doors for the last time on Sunday,” the restaurant posted. “We would like to extend a massive thank you to everyone who has made this restaurant feel like home for over three decades. It’s been an unforgettable run!”\n\nTaco Bell and KFC work on simplifying their restaurants\n\nChick-fil-A making major change to 425 restaurants nationwide\n\nBankrupt beer and pizza restaurant chain closes locations\n\nRestaurant chain famed for rude waiters closes multiple locations\n\nThese shutdowns leave only five Massachusetts locations listed on the chain’s website. Two locations are listed for New Hampshire, in Concord and Tilton. No Uno restaurants remain in Rhode Island.\n\nUno did not return a request for comment from the news station.\n\nDedham, Massachusetts: Uno Pizzeria & Grill location closed permanently on Jan. 11, after 37 years in business.\n\nRevere, Massachusetts: Longtime local restaurant shut its doors on Jan. 11, ending 34 years of service.\n\nBraintree, Massachusetts: Uno closed this 33-year-old location on Jan. 11.\n\nWarwick, Rhode Island: The last Uno Pizzeria & Grill in Rhode Island closed alongside the Massachusetts locations.\n\nSignificant reduction in total units: Uno has been shrinking over the past few years; it closed more than a quarter of its U.S. system in 2024, dropping from around 68 locations to about 53, and continued closures have pushed that count lower in 2025, reported Nation's Restaurant News (NRN).",

    "fullText": "Uber Eats might end up playing a key role in its parent company's robotaxi business, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said.\n\nThe ride-hailing app is working with multiple companies, such as Alphabet-backed Waymo, to make self-driving cars available through its app. Waymo's robotaxis have already proven more efficient than most human Uber drivers in cities such as Atlanta and Austin, Uber has said.\n\nOne big question hanging over robotaxis, though, is what happens to the vehicles during times of the day when demand for rides is low, Khosrowshahi said on Uber's fourth-quarter earnings call on Wednesday.\n\nHe pointed to one solution: Have them drive orders to customers through Uber's food delivery and freight businesses.\n\nSome delivery services, such as DoorDash, are also experimenting with robotaxis for food deliveries. Uber offers both ride-hailing and delivery, meaning robotaxis on its network could shift between the two as demand for each changes, Khosrowshahi said on Wednesday.\n\n\"Having delivery and freight as part of our logistics ecosystem gives us an opportunity to actually use these vehicles at a structurally higher utilization than anyone else,\" Khosrowshahi said.\n\nWhile ride-hailing accounted for over half of Uber's revenue in the fourth quarter, its delivery business grew by 29%, a faster clip than the 18% growth rate its ride-hailing segment posted in the same period.\n\nHow efficiently companies use the autonomous vehicles that they put on the streets is one of the challenges hanging over the technology.\n\nSafety is another. Last month, a Waymo car injured a child near a school in Santa Monica, California, the latest in a series of accidents involving self-driving cars. Waymo said it is cooperating with a federal probe into the accident.\n\nWhile it doesn't operate self-driving cars directly, Uber is experimenting with ways to train the AI behind robotaxis using data it collects from human drivers, Khosrowshahi said. Uber has a partnership with Nvidia to collect that data, for instance. Last month, Uber said it would launch AV Labs, an arm focused on similar training efforts.\n\nKhosrowshahi said the goal is to make self-driving cars more reliable and avoid situations such as last year's Waymo blackout in San Francisco, when a power outage prompted the company to suspend services. \"The real world can create unexpected circumstances,\" he said.\n\nRobotaxis also require infrastructure to store, charge, and repair. Some companies, such as startup Voltera, are building depots for those purposes in anticipation of a robotaxi boom in the coming years.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Frozen dessert fast-food chains are among the favorite shops that consumers enjoy visiting, but financial distress in some cases leads to bankruptcies and closings that disappoint customers.\n\nThe ice cream shop industry reported 0.9% growth in 2025, according to data from IBISWorld, but still faces economic issues.\n\n\"Despite the general increase in appetite for ice cream, significant challenges must be navigated,\" IBISWorld said in the report.\n\nAmong the economic challenges the report cited is the rising cost of milk, which cuts into profits.\n\nTariffs on Canadian dairy products have also increased the cost of milk and butter that are essential for ice cream production, which drives up retail prices and reduces profit margins, the report said.\n\nCustomers' most preferred shops include Baskin-Robbins, Ben & Jerry's, Cold Stone Creamery, Dairy Queen, and Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers.\n\nCertain chains ran into some economic problems in 2025 that forced them to file for bankruptcy or close locations.\n\nIce cream shop operators have stated a variety of reasons for closing down, including rising costs of labor and products driven by inflation or, more recently, tariffs; high lease payments; increased costs of debt from higher interest rates; and changing attitudes toward shopping by consumers.\n\nAbout 30 Dairy Queens in Texas lost their franchises in the first half of 2025 when the parent company, American Dairy Queen, pulled the franchises from franchisee Project Lonestar after it failed to remodel its locations. That meant that those locations could not order supplies from the parent corporation and would have to shut down.\n\nAnd now the parent company of the Cream ice cream shop chain has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy to reorganize and restructure its debts, which includes an employment law lawsuit judgment.\n\nCreamy Treats Inc. filed its petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California on Feb. 2, listing $500,000 to $1 million in assets and $100,000 to $500,000 in liabilities.\n\nThe San Francisco-based ice cream shop chain, which specializes in fresh ice cream sandwiches, did not list a specific reason for filing for bankruptcy protection, but among its largest unsecured creditors was Halil Budan, who is owed $98,000 for an employment law lawsuit. The debtor also listed Square Financial Services, owed $27,000.\n\n73-year-old family diner franchisee files Chapter 11 bankruptcy\n\nMore troubled regional airlines file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy\n\nMajor department store brand liquidates in Chapter 11 bankruptcy",

    "description": "UPFs are made to encourage addiction and consumption and should be regulated like tobacco, say researchers",
    "fullText": "UPFs are made to encourage addiction and consumption and should be regulated like tobacco, say researchers\n\nUltra-processed foods (UPFs) have \n\nUPFs and cigarettes are engineered to encourage addiction and consumption, researchers from three US universities said, pointing to the parallels in widespread health harms that link both.\n\nUPFs, which are widely available worldwide, are food products that have been industrially manufactured, often using emulsifiers or artificial colouring and flavours. The category includes soft drinks and packaged snacks such as crisps and biscuits.\n\nThere are similarities in the production processes of UPFs and cigarettes, and in manufacturers’ efforts to optimise the “doses” of products and how quickly they act on reward pathways in the body, according to the paper from researchers at Harvard, the University of Michigan and Duke University.\n\nThey draw on data from the fields of addiction science, nutrition and public health history to make their comparisons, published on 3 February in the healthcare journal the Milbank Quarterly.\n\nThe authors suggest that marketing claims on the products, such as being “low fat” or “sugar free”, are “health washing” that can stall regulation, akin to the advertising of cigarette filters in the 1950s as protective innovations that “in practice offered little meaningful benefit”.\n\nUltra-processed food involves extremely high levels of manufacturing to produce. It includes all formula milk, many commercially produced baby and toddler foods, fizzy drinks and sweets, fast food, snacks, biscuits and cakes, as well as mass-produced bread and breakfast cereals, ready meals and desserts.\n\nUltra-processed ingredients include fruit juice concentrates, maltodextrin, dextrose, golden syrup, hydrogenated oils, soya protein isolate, gluten, “mechanically separated meat”, organic dried egg whites, as well as rice and potato starch and corn fibre. Additives such as monosodium glutamate, colourings, thickeners and glazing agents are also ultra-processed.\n\nUltra-processed food contains higher levels of salt, sugar, fat and additives that are associated with obesity, cancer, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. They also tend to have lower levels of protein, zinc, magnesium, vitamins A, C, D, E, B12 and niacin necessary for a child’s optimal growth and development. It is also thought that other mechanisms are at play in UPFs being associated with worse health outcomes, including negative effects on the development of gut microbiota.\n\n“Many UPFs share more characteristics with cigarettes than with minimally processed fruits or vegetables and therefore warrant regulation commensurate with the significant public health risks they pose,” they concluded.\n\nOne of the authors, Prof Ashley Gearhardt of the University of Michigan, a clinical psychologist specialising in addiction, said her patients made the same links: “They would say, ‘I feel addicted to this stuff, I crave it – I used to smoke cigarettes [and] now I have the same habit but it’s with soda and doughnuts. I know it’s killing me; I want to quit, but I can’t.’”\n\nThe debate around UPFs fits a well-worn pattern in the field of addiction, according to Gearhardt. She said: “We just blame it on the individual for a while and say ‘oh, you know, just smoke in moderation, drink in moderation’ – and eventually we get to a point where we understand the levers that the industry can pull to create products that can really hook people.”\n\nWhile food, unlike tobacco, is essential for survival, the authors argue that the distinction makes action doubly necessary because it is difficult to opt out of the modern food environment.\n\nGearhardt said it should be possible to distinguish between harmful UPFs and other foodstuffs in the same way that alcoholic drinks are differentiated from other beverages.\n\nUPFs meet “established benchmarks” as to whether a substance should be considered addictive, the paper argues, with design features that “can drive compulsive use” – although “the harms of UPFs are clear, irrespective of their addictive nature”.\n\nThe authors suggested that lessons from tobacco regulation, “including litigation, marketing restrictions and structural interventions”, could offer a guide to reducing harm related to UPFs, calling for public health efforts to “shift from individual responsibility to food industry accountability”.\n\nProf Martin Warren, chief scientific officer at the Quadram Institute, a specialist food research centre, said that while there were parallels between UPFs and tobacco, the authors risked “overreach” in their comparisons.\n\nThere were questions, he said, over whether UPFs were, like nicotine, “intrinsically addictive in a pharmacological sense, or whether they mainly exploit learned preferences, reward conditioning and convenience”.\n\nHe said it was also important to consider whether the adverse health effects attributed to UPFs came from their contents, or because they replaced “whole foods rich in fibre, micronutrients and protective phytochemicals”. He said: “This distinction matters, because it influences whether regulatory responses should mirror tobacco control or instead prioritise dietary quality, reformulation standards, and food system diversification.”\n\nDr Githinji Gitahi, chief executive of Amref Health Africa, said: “This journal article reinforces a growing public health alarm sounding across Africa [where] corporates have found a comfortable, and profitable, nexus: weak government regulation on harmful products and a changing pattern of consumption.\n\n“All this places new and preventable pressures on already stretched health systems,” he said. “Without publicly led interventions on the rising burden of non-communicable diseases, we risk health systems’ collapse.”",

    "fullText": "For any Super Bowl party, the air fryer is the real MVP.\n\nWith the Super Bowl just around the corner on February 8, it's time to build a roster of easy air-fryer recipes to feed your guests in time for kickoff.\n\nAir fryers have become a popular kitchen gadget, found in around two-thirds of US homes, according to market-research firm Circana.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to cookbook authors Todd Porter and Diane Cu-Porter, the writers behind Air Fryer World, about their go-to game-day appetizers for the air fryer, and also dug into popular recipes that can be made in the appliance.\n\nHere are 10 easy game-day foods you can make in an air fryer.\n\n\"You can definitely use the air fryer if you like crispy foods, appetizers, and chicken wings,\" said Todd Porter and Diane Cu-Porter, the bloggers behind Air Fryer World.\n\nOne suggestion they had for air-fried game-day foods is air-fried chicken wings.\n\n\"Wings are awesome in the air fryer! The hot circulating air makes them naturally crispy, but for extra crunch, use cornstarch for an awesome crust,\" they said.\n\nTo follow Air Fryer World's recipe for ultra-crispy wings, toss your slightly dried chicken wings with your desired spices and olive oil. Make sure your air fryer is pre-heated to 400 degrees Fahrenheit before adding them. When they're done, usually in under 10 minutes, toss your wings in your favorite sauce and put them on the table, ready to eat.\n\nAnother game-day appetizer is Air Fryer World's recipe for jalapeño poppers with bacon. To make them, start by stuffing hollowed-out jalapeño peppers with cream cheese and cheddar, wrap them in bacon, and cook for 10 to 12 minutes at 380 degrees Fahrenheit until the bacon is crispy.\n\nYou can also buy premade frozen poppers and use the air fryer to crisp them up, by following this recipe.\n\nTo make them, roll mini sausages or hot dogs in crescent dough and set your air fryer to 325 degrees Fahrenheit, according to this Pillsbury recipe. For an even cook, you want to ensure the pigs in a blanket aren't overcrowded, so you might want to make them in rounds if you're making a lot.\n\nHowever, they should only take a few minutes to get nice and crispy, so they'll still be on the table by kickoff.\n\nFrozen tater tots can easily be made in the air fryer by spraying an even layer with a little cooking spray and tossing them halfway through the cooking cycle.\n\nThen, get to work choosing your toppings. You can create a loaded tater-tot bar, with additions like sour cream, chopped green onions, shredded cheese, queso, store-bought salsa, or guacamole.\n\nIf you want to go the extra mile, sauté some bacon or chorizo in a saucepan and top your loaded tots to your heart's content.\n\nThese \"fries,\" which The Recipe Critic calls \"a low-carb, keto-friendly snack,\" pair well with multiple sauces, including ketchup, ranch, or even a spicy mayo. For a little added flavor, mix garlic powder or cayenne into your breading before tossing it with olive oil-topped zucchini slices.\n\nTo make, pre-cook your hollowed-out potato skins and place them inside the air fryer, skin-side down, according to one recipe by Air Fryer Eats.\n\nWhen they're almost crispy, fill them with your choice of cheese and stick them back in the air fryer for a few minutes. Then, top with bacon, green onion, or sour cream.\n\nWhether you choose to go classic Italian with your flavors or dip your cooked meatballs in barbecue sauce, making meatballs in an air fryer is much faster than a typical oven and will be just as delicious.\n\nAir Fryer World recommends placing an even layer of meatballs into the air fryer and baking them at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for between 7 and 12 minutes until they're golden brown.\n\nYou can either bread your own shrimp, like this recipe from All Recipes, or follow the instructions on the back of most frozen coconut-shrimp packages for cooking them in the air fryer.\n\nServe with a tartar sauce or spicy mayo.\n\nAir Fryer World says that for perfectly crispy dumplings, you'll want to spray them with a little cooking spray before frying them. To get both sides evenly cooked, flip them over at the eight-minute mark and continue cooking for a few more minutes until they're done.\n\nServe with a little soy sauce and green onion.\n\nYou can make your favorite stuffed mushroom recipe as usual before air-frying, or go with Air Fryer World's recipe for cheesy stuffed mushrooms. Either way, moisten your air fryer basket or foil with cooking spray or olive oil and arrange your stuffed mushrooms evenly in the air fryer.\n\nPork sausage also works well as a filling, but you can also use spinach and cream cheese for a vegetarian twist.\n\nCook them at 360 degrees Fahrenheit for 6 to 8 minutes, then add the cheese and cook for another 2 minutes.",

    "title": "I visited Bad Bunny's high-end Miami steakhouse. For $164, I got 6 bites of food and dessert.",
    "description": "Bad Bunny opened Gekko, a Japanese steakhouse in Miami, in 2022. Ahead of his Super Bowl appearance, I wanted to see if it was worth the hype.",
    "fullText": "I was surprised by the restaurant's location, which is far from the exclusive, low-profile celebrity enclave I'd expected.\n\nInstead, it's located across from Brickell City Centre, a buzzy, crowded mall with a wide range of retailers, from mass consumer brands like Bath & Body Works, H&M, and Apple to more high-end retailers like Saks Fifth Avenue, Richard Mille, and Porsche Design.\n\nIt is also next to a gas station, and traffic makes the intersection loud and chaotic.\n\nMaking the reservation online was easier than I expected, especially for a Friday night during Miami's peak tourist season.\n\nWhen I booked it — only a couple of days before I went — nearly all dining times were available for inside, outside, and bar seating, suggesting that either the restaurant wasn't a highly popular choice or that reservations weren't always needed.\n\nWhen booking my reservation online, I had to agree to a dress code that forbade athletic wear, shorts, tank tops, cutoff sleeves, and flip flops, as well as \"athletic- or beverage-branded baseball hats.\"\n\nI didn't find the dress code restrictive at all; I saw it as the restaurant's effort to keep out overly casual patrons and to make dining there feel like an event.\n\nSitting inside the restaurant, I could see how high-profile guests might feel at home in its intimate space.\n\nThe tables set around the perimeter of the restaurant were dimly lit. Booths in the back and private dining areas indicated that the place was designed with privacy in mind.\n\nAfro-house and reggaeton music played throughout the restaurant — it was loud enough to conceal nearby conversations but not so loud that we needed to shout.\n\nA three-sided chef's counter at the center of the dining space felt like a stage for them and their work.\n\nHowever, the sushi chefs weren't eccentric performers. Instead, it felt like watching masters of their craft artfully handle their exclusive ingredients.\n\nThe menu, which has five steak offerings, also includes a section devoted to five different wagyu options, ranging from the $120 4-ounce A5 Hot Stone entrée to the $598 4-ounce olive-fed \"Wagyu Experience.\"\n\nAside from the steaks on the menu, wagyu is also featured in other dishes, from appetizers like wagyu crispy rice, dumplings, and steak tacos, to surf-and-turf nigiri with lobster.\n\nI got the wagyu crispy rice, one of the restaurant's most popular appetizers. At $34, it's also one of the most affordable wagyu items on the menu, and it's meant to be shared.\n\nThe dish came with four pieces of fried rice squares topped with raw wagyu tartare and crispy capers.\n\nThe raw meat was the star of the show, with each rice square featuring a generous portion of the tartare. It had a strong, spicy, slightly acidic flavor that complemented the velvety, rich beef. The crispy capers were the cherry on top, and I found myself craving those more than the wagyu itself.\n\nFrom looking at Gekko's menu, you know what kind of crowd would most usually dine here, and what their tax brackets might be.\n\nItems on the menu feature ingredients like caviar and lobster, and don't shy away from using 24-karat gold leaf. I tried to pick as many of the glitzier dishes as I could while staying within a reasonable budget.\n\nFor my main bites — all two of them — I got the gold-topped otoro nigiri, which was $19 a piece, and the surf-and-turf nigiri, which featured torched wagyu and lobster, and cost $17 for one piece.\n\nWhile other nigiri pieces were half the price for a comparable portion, I went into the meal hoping to test whether the upcharge and hype were worth it.\n\nThe gold-topped otoro nigiri was silky and melted in my mouth. Even as someone who isn't the most well-versed in the difference between cuts of tuna, I could tell that the quality of the fish was unlike any I had tried at more affordable price points.\n\nI felt similarly about the surf-and-turf nigiri bite. The thin-sliced torched wagyu had a delicious smoky flavor, and the bite was velvety, with the wagyu's marbling making for a really pleasant texture.\n\nIf each bite wasn't the price of a full budget meal, I could've devoured a few more.\n\nIn trying out some of the most expensive items, I found that some high-end elements, like the gold leaf or the lobster, didn't play as much of a role as I expected for the price point, and that I would've enjoyed the dishes just as much without them.\n\nFor a total of $164 after tax and tip, I only got six bites of food: four in the crispy rice appetizer, which was labeled as an item to share, and one bite in each of the nigiri.\n\nThe total also included two drinks and dessert.\n\nWhile the bites were excellent and well-balanced, I felt some components of the dishes were just fancy for the sake of looking expensive and didn't add much to the dish for me, like the 24-karat gold leaf on the tuna nigiri.\n\nAt \"only\" $24, which felt reserved compared to some of the other menu items, the miso dulcey lava cake was the most worth-it item from my visit, and I wouldn't hesitate to come back just for it.\n\nThe decadent, made-on-demand dessert, which came with a 15-minute wait as staff prepared it, featured silky vanilla ice cream, shortbread crumbles, and icing printed with the restaurant's logo.\n\nThe cake itself had a crispy, toasted exterior and a rich, miso-and-dulce-de-leche filling that spilled out. Paired with the ice cream and crumbs, this dessert was the standout for me.",

    "fullText": "Plastic pollution is an enormous global problem, and a lot of focus has been rightly placed on the devastating effects that plastic is having on our oceans and marine life. But plastic pollution on land is a big problem, too, as experts have recently been reminded when they started discovering giant blobs of the stuff inside the stomachs of dead camels.\n\nCalifornia-based environmental scientist Marcus Eriksen and United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based veterinary microbiologist Ulrich Wernery co-authored an article titled \"The plight of camels eating plastic waste.\"\n\nEriksen described one autopsy as \"the most surreal thing in the world,\" and their findings showed that plastic clumps called polybezoars, which Eriksen said \"range from the size of a basketball to roughly a large suitcase,\" are responsible for 1% of the camel deaths in the UAE\n\n\"All [camels] know in the desert [is] if it's not sand, it's food,\" Eriksen said. \"If they see a plastic bag stuck in a tree … or stuck against a fence, they might think, 'Oh, that's a novel piece of food,' and they'll consume it.\"\n\nThe effects of eating plastic are devastating for the camels, causing intestinal blockages, creating lacerations inside their stomachs, and creating a toxic environment for bacteria to grow amid the folds of the plastic.\n\n\"It's a slow death,\" Eriksen said. \"Imagine if you had five plastic bags crushed up in your body, and maybe a dozen bottle caps and a few straws, and it stayed there for years. I mean, you would suffer until you'd ultimately perish from that ingested trash. And that's what the camels are experiencing.\"\n\nCamels are not the only land animals facing this challenge, either. A sick bear in Colorado was recently euthanized and found to have plastic waste blocking its digestive system. Plastic waste consumption also killed two elephants in Sri Lanka.\n\nAs plastic waste causes more and more animal deaths, there is some hope that public pressure will cause governments to regulate it more heavily. Canada banned single-use plastics in 2021, and other places, such as Massachusetts, have taken similar steps.\n\nAs far as steps we can take to reduce our plastic consumption in our regular lives, we can make sure we understand how to recycle as effectively as possible and shun single-use plastics by using things like reusable water bottles.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the coolest innovations improving our lives and saving our planet.",

    "fullText": "Argentine cherry growers are facing a challenging season with severe rain and hailstorms. Production and exports have fallen due to this change in climate. The damaged crop has threatened global food supplies and farmers' livelihoods.\n\nEurofruit reported that poor weather caused Argentine cherry shipments in the last quarter of 2025 to hit a low.\n\nPlanet protection agency SENASA confirmed that cherry shipments totaled 3,760 tonnes (over 4,100 tons). This is a 38% decrease from last year and 19% below the five-year average.\n\nThe \"sector [is] on course for its worst season since 2019,\" per the report.\n\nGrowers projected good-quality crops to exceed last year's totals.\n\nAccording to Eurofruit, rain and hailstorms damaged \"the main producing areas\" instead. Much of the crop went to the domestic market.\n\nShifts in export markets are also happening in the 2025/26 season. Despite the drop in volumes, the U.S. is becoming the top destination (36%), while China's share fell (26%).\n\nBad weather in Argentine cherry production indicates how an overheating planet impacts crops. Farming communities and importing countries rely on crops for food and to support their economies.\n\nFrequent extreme weather events, which have been increasing, damage agricultural yields. Financial losses for farmers ensue, jeopardizing their ability to sustain their operations. Reduced harvests leave consumers with less supply in international markets. Scarcity in fruits such as cherries could also lead to higher prices.\n\nDisrupted food systems, driven by unpredictable weather, foreground a changing climate.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nMore expensive groceries and reduced availability of fresh produce are consequences of this. Food supply chains can be fragile as weather events cause downturns across continents.\n\nClimate-related threats to a stable and affordable food supply are local and global.\n\nThe agricultural sector is focusing on strategies to build resilience against extreme weather.\n\nInfrastructure investments such as anti-hail netting and improved drainage systems can protect crops. Developing climate-resilient crop varieties and adopting adaptive farming techniques are also crucial steps.\n\nReducing planet-warming pollution from coal, gas, and oil is essential. Doing so stabilizes global temperatures and mitigates extreme weather events that ruin agriculture.\n\nConsumers can support policies that advocate for sustainable agriculture and climate action. Understanding the critical climate issues at hand helps find the right solutions.\n\nThe current cherry season in Argentina has its setbacks. Climate-based farming practices offer hope for a future with more stable food production.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Hamburger chains dominated the fast-food sector in the 1980s and '90s after the \"burger wars\" launched among McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's.\n\nThe burger wars transitioned into an original chicken sandwich war, also in the 1980s, among the same three rivals. It was revived in the new millennium with Popeyes' launch of its chicken sandwich in August 2019.\n\nRival Chick-fil-A countered Popeyes' new sandwich with a statement on Twitter that its sandwich was the original, introduced in 1964, and fast-food chains everywhere began introducing or reintroducing chicken sandwiches.\n\nWith all of these chicken sandwiches launching, fried chicken restaurants became the most popular concept in fast food.\n\nFried chicken dining chains are likely to remain the most popular subsector of the fast-food industry in 2026, if the concept continues the trend it set over the last year.\n\nTraffic to chicken concepts rose 3% in the year ending September 2025, while all concepts dropped 1% compared to the previous year, according to market research firm Circana, as reported by Fast Company.\n\nThe variety of chicken options offered, such as chicken pieces, chicken fingers, or chicken sandwiches, and how consumers enjoy their choices, may contribute to the continued popularity of the concept, an expert says.\n\n“This is due to the experiences the brands are creating as well as the variety of chicken and how you can enjoy it,” industry expert Reilly Newman of Motif Brands told The Food Institute. “This comes to no surprise, as the experience economy has been taking root across the globe.\n\n“Chicken allows for (ample) customization, sauces, and forms, depending on the buyer’s preferences,” Newman said.\n\nNot every fast-food chicken restaurant benefited from increased traffic in 2025, as some operators suffered financial difficulties that led to bankruptcy filings.\n\nA bankrupt operator of more than 130 Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen franchise restaurants has closed 17 underperforming locations in Florida and Georgia and filed a motion to reject all of the stores' leases.\n\nThe franchisee, Sailormen Inc., which declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Jan. 15, filed a motion in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida in Miami to reject the leases after closing eight locations on Jan. 19, five locations on Jan. 20, and four locations on Jan. 22, according to court papers.\n\nThe debtor asserts that the leases should be rejected as of the petition date, since the restaurants were closed within one week of the petition date and before the hearing on the debtor's first-day motions.",

    "description": "Cubans from all walks of life are hunkering into survival mode, navigating lengthening blackouts and soaring prices for food, fuel and transport as the U.S.",
    "fullText": "HAVANA, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Cubans from all walks of life are hunkering into survival mode, navigating lengthening blackouts and soaring prices for food, fuel and transport as the U.S. threatens a stranglehold on the communist-run nation.\n\nTogether, those discussions paint a picture of a ​people pushed to the limit as goods and services - particularly those tied to ever more limited fuel supplies - become scarcer and more expensive.\n\nFor much of rural Cuba, this is not entirely new. The island's frail and antiquated power generation system ‌has been slowly failing for years and residents have grown accustomed to spending hours at a time without functioning electricity, internet or water pumps.\n\nBut the seaside capital, where the streets are lined with 1950s-era cars and colorful if decrepit Spanish colonial architecture, has until recently fared better.\n\nNow crisis looks set to swamp it, too, as fuel shortages ‌take hold, with first Venezuela, then Mexico halting oil shipments to the island.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has said tariffs will be imposed on imports from countries that supply Cuba with oil, ratcheting up the pressure on Washington's long-time foe in the wake of the ousting of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a key Cuban ally, in early January.\n\nIn many other countries, the conditions would have sent people out into the streets. So far, in a nation where dissent has long been curbed, there has been little sign of protest. But it is unclear how much more Cubans will be willing to endure.\n\nCuba's peso has lost more than 10% of its value against the dollar in three weeks, pushing up the price of groceries.\n\n\"This has put me in an impossible situation,\" said Yaite Verdecia, a Havana resident and housewife. \"There's no salary that can cope with this.\"\n\nDAILY LIFE GETTING ⁠MORE DIFFICULT\n\nTrump, when asked about the prospect of a U.S. military intervention in Cuba shortly after ‌the capture of Maduro, said he did not think an attack was necessary because \"it looks like it's going down.\"\n\nOn Friday, Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez declared an \"international emergency\" in response to the U.S. tariff warning, which he said constituted \"an unusual and extraordinary threat.\"\n\nBut the government has said little about how it will manage the growing threat of humanitarian crisis.\n\nMany of the Cubans Reuters spoke with said daily life - already difficult - had ‍been reduced to basics like assuring food, fuel for cooking, and water, and that it had become noticeably harder in recent days.\n\nLines for gasoline have grown significantly this week at a handful of service centers in the city still supplied with fuel. And since the U.S. blocked Venezuelan deliveries of oil to Cuba in mid-December, virtually all gas has been sold at a premium, in dollars - a currency to which few Cubans have access.\n\n\"It used to be that you could sign up and get fuel once a month (in pesos),\" said Havana resident Jesus Sosa, referring to an app that would let residents know ​when it was their turn to fill up their cars. \"Not anymore. Sales in national currency have stopped.\"\n\n'YOU HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE OR STAY HOME'\n\nThe crunch has hit both public and private transportation, putting some buses and private taxis out of business and forcing ‌others to raise their prices.\n\nDaylan Perez, a 22-year-old who hails private taxis for clients in old Havana, said fewer buses mean people now have no choice but to pay rising fees for private transport.\n\n\"You have to pay the price or stay home,\" he said.\n\nEven transportation by electric vehicle - once thought to be a panacea in a city short of fuel - has been hit by blackouts that now last for eight to 12 hours or more.\n\nTaxi driver Alexander Leyet of Havana swapped to an electric three-wheeled taxi recently, thinking he had outsmarted the pack.\n\n\"Now because of the blackouts I can only charge my taxi for four or five hours,\" he said.\n\nFor decades, the government that has its roots in Fidel Castro's 1959 Cuban Revolution has survived despite sometimes brutal economic struggles, upending regular predictions of imminent collapse or an uprising.\n\nIt has long alleged a U.S.-led effort to foment revolt, but the most recent widespread protests were in the pandemic year of 2021, despite a 12% contraction of the economy between 2019 and 2024.\n\nSharp crackdowns on any form of dissent, combined with the emigration of between one and ⁠two million people since the pandemic, have all but eliminated organized in-country opposition. The Cubans interviewed by Reuters generally declined to answer questions about the prospect ​of protests.\n\nBut none of those interviewed disputed that change was necessary.\n\n\"I'm just praying God finds a way to get us out of this (mess),\" said Mirta ​Trujillo, a 71-year-old street vendor from Guanabacoa who burst into tears as she told Reuters she could no longer afford food. Previously, she had depended on a ration book of basic goods provided by the government, but that was phased out post-pandemic as tourist income and other sources of hard currency dried up.\n\n\"I'm not against my country... but I don't want to die of hunger,\" she said.\n\nOn a recent weekday evening, Reuters witnessed an ‍accident at a busy intersection in Havana where the stoplights were not ⁠functioning as a result of a power outage.\n\n\"Sometimes when the power goes out, accidents happen because the traffic lights don't work,\" said Raysa Lemu, whose apartment overlooks a boulevard in Marianao, on the outskirts of Havana.\n\n\"It used to be they turned off the power two or three times a week, but now it's every day and sometimes it's up to 12 hours.\"\n\nJulia Anita Cobas, a 69-year-old housekeeper from Guanabacoa, gets up at 4 a.m. each morning for a 10-mile (16-km) commute that now approaches four ⁠hours round-trip. With less public transportation available, the journey has become longer and more costly.\n\n\"I leave my house before sunrise and I don't know how I'll get back,\" she said.\n\nBut Cobas, who was born just before Castro's revolution, said she had no expectation that Trump would make things any better.\n\n\"Since I was born the (United States) ‌has been threatening us, and every day we deal with hardship. But we've survived it all,\" she said.\n\nAimee Milanes, a 32-year-old resident of Reparto Electrico, just outside Havana, said neither the Cuban nor the U.S. government offered her ‌much hope.\n\n\"We're drowning. But there's nothing we can do,\" said Milanes. \"This is about survival. Nothing else.\"",

    "title": "I flew 9 hours in Europe's top-rated airline economy class. The food was the biggest surprise.",
    "description": "Turkish Airlines is considered the best airline in Europe. Besides a few complaints, I get the hype — and I'd actually recommend eating the food.",
    "fullText": "I've flown coach on most major European and North American carriers, and economy food rarely makes a mark. Air Canada, British Airways, and United didn't exactly impress; Finnair and Delta were better, but not memorable.\n\nMy recent Turkish Airlines flight from New York to Istanbul, though, was beyond the norm.\n\nThe airline was named Europe's best economy class in the 2025 Skytrax awards, which evaluate cabin service, seating, and catering. Despite a few complaints, I could see why.\n\nPassengers received printed menus ahead of the meal service, detailing mains and sides — including salmon — all served with real cutlery. It wasn't the usual \"chicken or pasta,\" and the food tasted as good as it looked.\n\nTurkish outsources its New York catering to the Austrian company DO & CO. While DO & CO prepares meals for multiple airlines, Turkish sets its own standards for ingredients, plating, and presentation — which helps explain why the food looked and tasted a cut above competitors.\n\nThe Boeing 787 seat was otherwise in line with competitors, with a headrest and power, though the provided headphones were scratchy. The seatback screen, however, was among the largest I've seen in economy.\n\nI also appreciated the linens and storage, and the deep recline made sleeping easier — though it comes with a trade-off: to comfortably watch TV or avoid feeling cramped, everyone needs to recline.\n\nThis isn't ideal for using the tray table for work or streaming, and it relies on everyone cooperating. While I personally don't mind, those on the \"you should not recline\" side of the viral debate may find this frustrating.\n\nHere's what the full nine-hour economy flight on Turkish was like.\n\nThe flight was operated by a Boeing 787, equipped with Turkish' most modern economy cabin. The midday departure is currently the only 787 option on the route; overnight flights still use the older 777, which has noticeably dated screens and onboard tech.\n\nI wanted to fly Turkish's most up-to-date product. You'll also find similarly modern seats on most of the airline's Airbus A350-900s.\n\nI didn't check a bag and checked in via the Turkish app, meaning I could skip the desk and head straight to security. But I noticed the check-in area had a long line that wrapped around the corner.\n\nThe desk closes 60 minutes before departure, so arriving early — or sticking to carry-on only — may save you some time.\n\nThe Turkish Business Lounge is part of the Priority Pass network, which I access through my Chase Sapphire Reserve credit card.\n\nIt was small but offered free food and drinks, including eggs, meat, muffins, yogurt, and vegetables. There were no alcoholic beverages, but it was a comfortable place to pass the time with views of the ramp.\n\nI always pay extra for an aisle on long-haul flights so I can get up without disturbing others. I chose seat 26C, the closest aisle seat to the front at that price point.\n\nEconomy is arranged in a 3-3-3 layout, and each seat has 31 inches of pitch — the space between seatbacks — and 17.4 inches of width.\n\nWhile headrests are now common across the industry, I appreciated the extra seatback compartments for organizing cables, headphones, and snacks.\n\nBefore the first meal service, the crew handed out warm towels, water, and printed menus detailing each course. Lunch, as we were departing midday, included a choice of grilled salmon or mushroom orecchiette, followed by sides and dessert.\n\nBreakfast, served about 1.5 hours before our 6:30 a.m. local arrival, was a choice between a tomato-and-cheese omelet or a waffle with blueberry purée and vanilla sauce. It's easy to see why Turkish won Skytrax's award for best economy catering.\n\nDespite my skepticism, the salmon, served with ratatouille, Caesar salad, and celeriac mousseline, was fresh and flavorful, and the portions were generous. I was full by the time I got to the carrot cake.\n\nThe waffle was fluffy and sweet, paired with fruit, cheese, and bread. Beer and wine were complimentary with lunch, and I enjoyed the Turkish beer.\n\nWhile nothing beats the bidet on Japan's All Nippon Airways, I was surprised to find both a makeup mirror and a full-size mirror in the lavatory — a convenient touch for freshening up.\n\nI don't usually recommend eating airline food if you can avoid it, but Turkish seems to have figured it out. The meals felt lighter and more satisfying than usual, similar to what I've experienced on five-star carriers like Singapore Airlines.\n\nThe main drawback is the seat recline, which may frustrate travelers who want to work and find their workspace cramped by the seat ahead of them.\n\nTurkish also doesn't have a premium economy cabin, and only a few rows have extra legroom. Taller passengers should book early to secure bulkhead seats.",

    "fullText": "In BBC Sport's Eat & Yap series, Alex Scott meets some of the best WSL players to share the food they love and to chat about life on and off the pitch.\n\nWatch the interview in full now on BBC iPlayer\n\nKerstin Casparij has been setting the pace down the flanks for league leaders Manchester City all season.\n\nOn the latest episode of Eat & Yap, while teaching Alex Scott how to create the Dutch delicacy oliebollen, she reveals how she ended up with a cat tattoo, why her girlfriend thought she was a gardener and why team-mate Vivianne Miedema causes her to swear in Dutch.\n\nAlex: OK, so talk to me, what's on the menu.\n\nKerstin: All right, so you'll see a massive pan of oil, which I know doesn't look too nice, but I've been able to prep some butter and this is for a snack called oliebollen.\n\nAlex: So this is a bit of home?\n\nKerstin: It is very Dutch and we only have them around New Year's. You can only get the packaging around New Year's as well. Don't look at the calories actually, because that's why we don't have them all year round!\n\nAlex: Some recipes had currants and raisins for this...\n\nKerstin: I don't like the raisins!\n\nAlex: We're on the same wavelength there! I'll warn you, I'm not very good at hiding things if I don't like them.\n\nKerstin: Alex, I'm Dutch. Do I look like the type that hides it?\n\nAlex: Talk to me a bit more about life at home because you grew up in what, a remote part of the Netherlands?\n\nKerstin: So I'm a northern girl. I'm from a province called the Friesland and I'm very lucky that I grew up in a small town where a lot of sports are available. Playing was like a two-minute walk from where I used to live, which was perfect.\n\nAlex: I feel like it was always definite you were going to go on and be an athlete then?\n\nKerstin: Well, my parents met both playing for the Dutch national team and they both did judo, so there was no choice other for us than to do sports.\n\nAlex: How did the people back home describe you back then?\n\nKerstin: People mostly described me as loud, very chatty - I'm raging ADHD. I've calmed down a little bit now but as a child I was all over the shop. It was such a good thing, growing up and wanting to become an athlete, because I was so hyper-focused on football.\n\nAlex: Sometimes that's hard to navigate, so how did you do that?\n\nKerstin: At that time I was really struggling to keep up in school, to get ready for tests and also do all my football. Once I had the diagnosis, I was speaking to psychologists and my parents were very supportive. It takes time and I still have a lot of things to learn about myself.\n\nAlex: Would you say Manchester feels like home for you now?\n\nKerstin: Definitely. I think the people here are so nice. That's one of the things I heard when I was going to join. I live here with my girlfriend - we've got our cats.\n\nAlex: So you met your girlfriend in Manchester?\n\nKerstin: We met on Tinder in Manchester. It was great for me because I was a bit lonely, living on my own and I was just excited to meet other people outside my team-mates. I love my team-mates but sometimes you want to see other people as well.\n\nAlex: Sometimes that's the part that's hard to explain. Yes, you are fully immersed in football but it's equally as important to have other hobbies.\n\nKerstin: My girlfriend always says: 'You've got such a football perspective' and also just work-life balance. It's so different than she has, working nine to five and being off at weekends. Your work is not your life, not your personality and it doesn't define who you are. Being able to see that side of it and her allowing me to step away is really nice.\n\nAlex: You said you met on Tinder?\n\nKerstin: Yeah and to be fair, I was debating whether to go on Tinder. This was at the point in my career where I wasn't that known.\n\nAlex: Did I read you didn't put any photos up on Tinder of you in football kit?\n\nKerstin: I didn't put any bio - I didn't put any pictures of football. So Ruth had no idea that I was even sporty. She thought I was a gardener because I was tanned… She had no idea about football so it was fun to introduce her to the world and now she's a massive fan. She knows all the gossip! Sometimes she comes home and she tells me these things and I'm like: 'How do you know this?'\n\nAlex: So you've got Ruth, and now two cats?\n\nKerstin: Kiwi and Mango. Both fruits. I got Kiwi because I was on my own and I was very lonely. Then I met Ruth a couple of months later and we're both away quite a lot so we thought we should get Kiwi a brother.\n\nAlex: And next level, you have a tattoo.\n\nKerstin: Yes, I've got a tattoo of them. Should I show you? I've got a tattoo of them looking into a wine glass just because they're cute and silly.\n\nAlex: Are you fully immersed in Manc life? What kind of slang words?\n\nKerstin: I kinda just copy everyone else.\n\nAlex: What about when you're back with the Dutch team?\n\nKerstin: I definitely struggle having to switch to Dutch again, like finding the words because I only speak Dutch with my mum.\n\nAlex: What are the team meetings like in Manchester City then? Is it fully English or do you have translators?\n\nKerstin: It's all English. I know some that do struggle a little bit and when they have a meeting with the coach, they do have a translator to make sure they're being heard. To be fair, team meetings are really good. Andree [Jeglertz] really made a point about it being really open. We're all in a massive circle rather than an auditorium so when you speak you can actually look directly at each other. We really work together and everybody has a voice.\n\nAlex: You do team bonding stuff?\n\nKerstin: We've made it a very big thing to have a lot of team activities this year. So I'm captain of the team activity crew together with Laura Coombs. We went to Crystal Maze the other day with players and staff, which we've made a big thing. We want to get together with the staff as well, just to get that connection.\n\nAlex: It's how they know you away from the field as well.\n\nKerstin: Yeah, exactly. More of your personality. Sometimes it can be a bit of a step to approach someone in a leadership role and to get everybody together and just do something fun away from the club in your own clothes creates such a nice bond. You actually have conversations that you might not have at the club.\n\nAlex: I think you've done a cooking class didn't you? How did that go?\n\nKerstin: It was a success - it was Italian dishes. Some people made amazing risotto, they were getting the lemon in and it looked unreal. Some people burned it and some people were screaming that it was sticking to the pan.\n\nAlex: Come on, name names. Who's the bad cook?\n\nKerstin: I'm not going to expose my team-mates.\n\nAlex: Let's talk about temptations and cravings, because people are starting to talk about Manchester City potentially lifting the WSL trophy this season. Are you believing? Why are you laughing at me?\n\nKerstin: I mean, it's kind of funny because we were in such an underdog position going into this season. I felt like everybody was talking about Chelsea, Arsenal, [Manchester] United. It was kind of nice being left out of the conversation and I think we really took that as motivation.\n\nAlex: What do you think has changed?\n\nKerstin: It's little tweaks that matter the most, and also Andree's playing style. We get so much freedom, and also trust and responsibility. Previously it was a good system but a bit robotic at times. We do all the analysis and he gives us everything we need but if something's a bit different, he can't change that from the side. Leaving that space allows us to be adaptable on the pitch.\n\nAlex: What do you put your form down to?\n\nKerstin: I've got such a strong desire to show everybody what I can do and be the best that I can be. I'm really enjoying our offensive style of play this year and linking up with Bunny [Shaw] and Kerolin and all the other incredible forwards that we have. It's just been a joy to work. I go every day with a smile on my face.\n\nAlex: I've always wanted to learn about different cultures and I suppose you have that at Manchester City?\n\nKerstin: That's one of the things I love about football in general. We travel to these amazing places, but also my team-mates are from many different continents and cultures. It's been an eye-opener because I'm from a northern town in the Netherlands. We didn't have a lot of diversity growing up, so meeting these incredible people has been really inspiring.\n\nAlex: There are some cheeky elements to your game, which I absolutely love. Is this you trying to put the opposition off?\n\nKerstin: To be fair, I'm a bit annoying when I'm marking, like trying to push away. I'm not the tallest, I'm not the best at heading so I'm a blocker. Just be the annoying little fly, the little mosquito that doesn't let them head the ball.\n\nAlex: You've now got Dutch team-mate Vivianne Miedama at the club - what's it like having her at club level?\n\nKerstin: She's a fantastic player. In training, it looks so easy and she looks like she's putting in minimum effort and she bangs it into top bins. I swear at her in Dutch - no-one knows what I'm saying! She's such a good player to have with all her experience. A little bit of Dutchness can do wonders.\n\nWatch: Manchester City v Chelsea in the Women's Super League on Sunday, 1 February (14:30 GMT) on BBC One and BBC iPlayer\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "title": "I went on my first cruise — here are 15 things that surprised me about this type of travel",
    "description": "From room size to food quality, my first-ever cruise on board Royal Caribbean's Wonder of the Seas was full of surprises.",
    "fullText": "The ship has 18 decks and 2,867 staterooms, according to Royal Caribbean.\n\nI booked a mid-tier room — a step above windowless interior staterooms, a step below staterooms with a balcony, and two steps below suites.\n\nMy 179-square-foot cabin had a private bathroom, a king-size bed, and an ocean view.\n\nI was surprised by how big the discount was. To me, $1,000 feels like a huge price difference for the same vacation.\n\nI thought the stateroom made great use of a small space with plenty of storage for my clothes and other belongings. There were two closets for hanging space and more drawers than I used.\n\nAfter leaving to start my day each morning, a stateroom attendant cleaned my room. And after I left for dinner each night, they came back to clean up again. Every evening, they brought me fresh towels — sometimes creatively folded — and a flyer featuring the next day's schedule, including the weather, dress code, and any other important information, such as a time change.\n\nThis surprised me because I am used to having my room serviced once daily, if at all, during my hotel stays, and never in Airbnbs.\n\nAn electronic shade over the window could be lowered to reveal grand views. I loved waking up after a night at sea to a front-row view of the place I'd be visiting that day.\n\nWhile windowless rooms are cheaper, I couldn't imagine staying in one. My ocean-view stateroom cost about $300 more than an entry-level room.\n\nI booked a stateroom at the front of deck eight and felt constant motion in my room.\n\nSome nights were rockier than others. On the roughest nights, I heard and felt a similar sensation to thunder beneath me every few minutes. Loud thumps and heavy vibrations in my room sounded like large pieces of furniture falling. The first night this happened, I feared the worst, but over time, I realized that this was a normal aspect of cruising — but one I would likely never get used to.\n\nAfter talking to seasoned cruisers on the ship, several told me that the front of the ship is one of the worst places to be for feeling motion. Higher decks in the middle of the ship feel calmer and more stable, they said.\n\nNext time, I'd choose a room in the middle of the ship.\n\nAll I had to do for safety training was watch a couple of videos — either on my room TV or on the Royal Caribbean app — and then check in at my assembly station, the area I was assigned to in case of an emergency. At the assembly station, an attendant checked the Royal Caribbean app to confirm that I had completed the mandatory training.\n\nI was expecting to attend a large safety training session once I got on the ship, so this alternative was a breeze.\n\nSince there were so many elevators on the ship, I expected them to be a pretty efficient way to get around. But they were often so crowded and slow that I took the stairs instead. By the middle of my trip, unless I was going all the way up to the pool decks, I always opted for the stairs to save time.\n\nThe ship has 16 guest decks; each deck is divided into three sections — forward, middle, and aft.\n\nIt took me a few days to get used to the sections, and I often found myself heading to the right deck but the wrong section of the ship. Luckily, there were maps on every floor, which I used until the morning I left.\n\nIf I woke up on deck five of Wonder of the Seas with no memory of my cruise, I'd think I was in a shopping mall.\n\nAside from the slight movement of the ship, the indoor decks were so big that, as a cruise newbie, it was hard to believe that I was on a gigantic boat in the middle of the ocean. Everywhere I looked, I saw shops, stands, restaurants, large sculptures, and a unique ceiling structure that reminded me of the malls I've visited.\n\nAside from music festivals, I've never heard more live music on a trip than on this cruise. On the communal decks, musicians played for hours while people relaxed and played around them. I was also surprised by the eclectic mix of genres I heard, from rock to jazz to classical.\n\nIn addition to the music hall, where concerts were regularly held, live bands performed on indoor and outdoor communal decks. Some people watched, while others listened while swimming, relaxing, or walking around.\n\nI like to be comfy, so I was dreading formal nights going into this cruise.\n\nI brought one fancy dress with me to wear whenever I needed, but on the first formal night, I realized that the dress code wasn't strictly enforced. People wore a range of outfits, from evening gowns to T-shirts.\n\nFor the rest of the trip, I also relaxed my interpretation of the dress code.\n\nThe excursion I was most thrilled about — a hot-air balloon ride over the Bahamas — was canceled the day of because the winds were too high.\n\nIt was on the last day of my trip, and with only one day in port, it could not be rescheduled. It was the experience I was looking forward to most, so I was disappointed. On a cruise ship, I learned that all plans are subject to change based on things outside the crew's control, like the weather.\n\nSince we traveled such a long way to each port, I wrongfully assumed we'd spend more time in them. The ship usually docked around 8 a.m. and left in the early afternoon.\n\nI thought I'd have time to explore the port for a while after each excursion, but some of my excursions took the entire day, getting me back to the boat just in time for departure. I also hoped to see what these places looked like at night, but we never departed after sundown.\n\nAlthough I got a taste of the Caribbean, I didn't have enough time to get a sense of each place, which made me realize that I would probably prefer to vacation in just one place and have time to truly explore it.",

    "description": "Some of the best things to do in Greenville, South Carolina, are visit the city's festivals, enjoy great food, and walk across the Liberty Bridge.",
    "fullText": "I've lived just outside Greenville, South Carolina, for the past 11 years and can't imagine calling anywhere else home.\n\nNamed one of \"The South's Best Cities in 2025\" by Southern Living and one of \"Readers' 15 Favorite Cities in the US of 2025\" by Travel + Leisure, it's easy to see why the city has seemingly exploded in popularity.\n\nHere are six of my favorite things to do in and around Greenville.\n\nI don't need to go far to see a beautiful waterfall in Greenville. Falls Park on the Reedy is a gorgeous green space in the middle of downtown, and the Reedy River weaves through it.\n\nFor the best views, I like to either walk across the Liberty Bridge (a curved suspension bridge overlooking the falls) or sit on a swing in the park while enjoying some ice cream from Jeni's.\n\nFor an adventure that's a bit further from the city, I drive about 45 minutes out to Jones Gap State Park to hike the Rainbow Falls trail. It leads to a stunning waterfall that plunges about 100 feet over a granite cliff.\n\nLocated next to the city's local airport are two of my family's favorites: Runway Park and Takeoff Mini Golf.\n\nRunway Park has an aviation-themed playground, complete with a short, paved runway trail that kids love to ride their bikes and scooters around. There are also two picnic areas available to rent for events.\n\nMeanwhile, Takeoff Mini Golf is a 19-hole course that's aviation-themed, too. Fun fact: If you get a hole-in-one on the last shot, a beacon will light up.\n\nWhat's great about both places is that you can actually see the airplanes taking off and landing while you're there.\n\nGreenville is home to a number of festivals, and some of my favorites are Artisphere, held annually on Mother's Day weekend, and Fall for Greenville, held each year in October.\n\nArtisphere highlights the work of artists around the country, lining Main Street with everything from handmade ceramics and paintings to sculptures and photography.\n\nOne of my favorite art pieces I've ever purchased — a stunning shot of the synchronous fireflies in the Great Smoky Mountains — was from a photographer at Artisphere. Plus, there are live performances and great food.\n\nMeanwhile, Fall for Greenville features live entertainment and food from local restaurants. Years ago at the festival, I was introduced to the restaurant Soby's, and now I always recommend it to visitors.\n\nThe Roper Mountain Science Center is home to the Dinosaur Adventure Trail, which has a variety of life-size dinosaur models.\n\nIt's hilarious to sit near the T. rex and watch as unsuspecting guests are shocked when it moves as they walk by.\n\nThe trail is open most of the summer and on Thursdays and Fridays throughout the school year, with tickets required.\n\nGreenville is a sleeper foodie destination that's about to land on the map when the next season of \"Top Chef\" drops, featuring episodes filmed in the city.\n\nTo experience Greenville's food scene in person, I recommend taking the \"At the Chef's Table\" culinary tour with Greenville History & Culinary Tours.\n\nI did this a year after moving to the area, and it helped me learn about the city's interesting history and where to find great food.\n\nThe tour includes visits to local restaurants — including one of my favorites, The Lazy Goat (the whole branzino and any of the desserts are incredible) — with explanations of the dishes from the chefs.\n\nBeyond the tour, I also love the burgers and garlic Parmesan fries at Windy City Burgers on E Coffee Street.\n\nLess than an hour's drive from downtown Greenville is the Fred W. Symmes Chapel (more commonly known as Pretty Place), home of the most stunning sunrise I've ever seen.\n\nThe chapel overlooks the Blue Ridge Mountains, and watching the sun streak through the clouds is an amazing experience.\n\nBe sure to check the online schedule for operating hours, since it's also a popular venue for weddings.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAnne Michael Maye's infamous baked goods are finally being taste tested by fans - and the early reviews are favorable.\n\nThe wife of New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye went viral on TikTok in December, after she began sharing Martha Stewart-inspired cooking videos in a series she called \"Bakemas.\" The videos have resulted in her being nicknamed the \"Queen of the North,\" and she's become so popular from the holiday series that she's continued the tradition in January, so far sharing recipes for a simple but tasty egg naan bread, spaghetti squash, and chicken salad.\n\nIn honor of her success with \"Bakemas,\" Anne gave away some of her baked homemade cookies to passengers headed on JetBlue flights to the AFC Championship Game over the weekend. Several lucky Patriots fans on flights out of Denver and Boston got to taste Drake's wife's cooking when they were given a homemade M&M cookie wrapped in a cellophane bag with the message, \"Created by Anne Michael and served by JetBlue.\"\n\nThe wife of a Pats' fan who received one of the special treats shared a TikTok video on Monday, that showed her husband and a friend taste testing the cookies.\n\nAt the beginning of the clip, the two men, dressed in Patriots merch, held up the oversized M&M cookies, and one said, \"The cookie. Let's see.\"\n\nThey then took a bite in unison, and began happily shaking their heads, impressed with what they were tasting.\n\n\"It's pretty good. Tastes like victory,\" one said, before the other agreed, saying, \"Wow. That's a quality cookie. She knows her stuff.\"\n\nPrior to the taste test, the man encountered Anne walking into the stadium and got to tell her he tried her cookies.\n\n\"Anne! I had your cookie. It was awesome,\" he yelled excitedly, although it's unclear if Anne heard him, as she didn't respond back.\n\nThe lucky Pats fan was so excited about getting the special treat that he whipped out his cellphone and hit record when the free cookie announcement was being made on his flight.\n\nHis wife shared the sweet moment in a second video featuring a flight attendant announcing Anne's special giveaway. The TikTok user captioned the post, \"When my boyfriend is on his way to CO for the Pats game and gets a cookie made by THE queen of the North.\"\n\n\"ANNE MICHAEL GAVE US COOKIES,\" the post continued.\n\nIn the short clip, the JetBlue flight attendant said, \"Anne Michelle Maye who you know is related to a certain MVP contender, she partnered with us to give you guys a little extra game day fuel. Enjoy and let's go Patriots.\"\n\nKendall Jenner takes aim at athlete ex-boyfriends and 'Kardashian curse' in Super Bowl ad\n\nCristiano Ronaldo's fiancee Georgina Rodriguez stuns in chic black dress at 'Melania' premiere\n\nMatthew Stafford's wife shares touching moment at home after Rams' AFC loss\n\nCardi B bundles up in oversized fur coat and knee boots at Patriots AFC Championship game\n\nJake Paul's fiancee Jutta Leerdam flaunts cheeky bikini ahead of Winter Olympics",

    "description": "Not all ultra-processed foods are inherently evil. A nutrition researcher says to choose options low in sugar and sodium and add vegetables.",
    "fullText": "Nutrition researcher Kevin Hall is both a committed scientist and a realist. He knows: it's pretty near-impossible for us to avoid ultra-processed foods entirely, given the food environment we live in.\n\nHall has studied diet and metabolism for years. He spearheaded some of the biggest and most influential studies upending long-held nutrition dogmas in his lab at the National Institutes of Health, until he stepped down last year.\n\nOver the course of his 21-year career at the NIH, he made remarkable discoveries about the metabolisms of \"The Biggest Loser\" contestants, pitted low-fat against low-carb diets (spoiler alert: no clear winner there), and discovered that people really do eat more calories and gain more weight when they're offered ultra-processed meals. That watershed news sparked the current craze for \"whole\" and \"real\" food and \"clean\" eating plans.\n\nStill, Hall says you don't need to be so rigid with your food rules to eat well. He maintains that not all ultra-processed foods are equally bad.\n\n\"There are plenty of ultra-processed foods that are available to folks that are still reasonable in terms of their nutritional profile,\" Hall told Business Insider, when his new book, \"Food Intelligence\" was released in 2025.\n\n\"The example that I use a lot is marinara sauce that we buy,\" he said. \"It's ultra-processed. It has additives to increase the shelf life.\"\n\nReady-to-heat sauce makes it easier for Hall and his family to craft simple, quick, nutritious meals on busy school nights. The best part of the strategy, he says, is that it nudges his family into eating more vegetables.\n\nHall's most recent research on ultra-processed foods suggests mixing veggies into a dinner with other ultra-processed components is a great way to boost the nutrition and calorie profile. Ultra-processed foods tend to be very calorie-dense, whereas veggies are not.\n\n\"When you make a meal, even if it contains some ultra-processed products, and even if those ultra-processed products might not have very low numbers of calories per gram, by mixing in vegetables, it's lowering the overall calorie density of the meal,\" he said.\n\nHall's latest nutrition study, completed in late 2025, suggests that people don't necessarily have to gain weight when they're eating ultra-processed diets, as long as their convenience foods are relatively nutritious and complemented by plenty of veggies. Vegetables are, famously, full of vitamins and minerals, but they're also generally pretty low-calorie, and yet filling due to their high fiber content. (Some people call these \"high-volume foods\" and they're great for weight loss.)\n\nHall's quick draw dinner solution has three main components:\n\nHall refused to specify which brand is his personal favorite, but he said he makes sure whatever sauce he picks out is both low in added sugar and relatively low in sodium.\n\nComplex carbs are a great source of dietary fiber, helping you stay fuller for longer after a meal, in addition to other nutrition benefits from the vitamins and minerals packed inside.\n\nThe veggies can be fresh or frozen. Hall likes to grill his before he adds them to the pasta.\n\nHall simply incorporates the grilled veggies into the pasta, then pours the jarred marinara on top \"so you don't have to make it from scratch,\" he said. \"That marinara sauce is ultra-processed, but it's made a much more tasty meal that now has lots of vegetables in it and the whole grain pasta. And so you're using ultra-processed products to help make it easier for people to stick to the kinds of diets that nutrition scientists have recommended for a very long time.\"\n\nIf an ultra-processed food allows you easier, more inexpensive access to a tasty meal that's low in added sugar with more whole grains and vegetables than you would otherwise eat, Hall says that's a definitive win.\n\n\"Just because something's ultra-processed does not necessarily mean that you want to ban it or you want to get rid of that type of food,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Old Trafford has reportedly been awarded a five-star food hygiene rating following an inspection of Manchester United’s catering areas.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, the club’s matchday and hospitality operation has now returned to the top rating after a period of scrutiny.\n\nThere are supporters who have spent huge sums of money for hospitality, and thus want the basics done properly on a matchday.\n\nThis is, therefore, positive news for United fans off the pitch and a brilliant week from the team on it.\n\nThe report states that Old Trafford previously suffered a drop in its rating after issues were raised during inspections. These concerns were linked to food preparation and storage areas.\n\nThere were also claims of problems in suites and kiosks, with earlier coverage revealing Trafford Council’s environmental health officers had issued a lower rating after a visit.\n\nThe club, however, was working to make improvements, and that report noted United had pointed to tough measures and multiple weekly checks across catering areas.\n\nThe Daily Mail now explains that the latest inspection has restored the five-star score. This is a sign that changes have been made and processes tightened.\n\nOld Trafford is not just a stadium; it is also a weekly event site that serves huge numbers across general concourses, lounges and corporate spaces. When standards slip, the backlash is immediate – and this is because it affects paying fans, or customers, in real time.\n\nUnited have spoken a lot in recent years about raising standards across the club. This is one of those areas where improvement is not optional – it is the minimum expectation.\n\nIf the report is accurate, the hope is that the five-star rating is not a one-off headline. Rather, it is the new normal for the stadium experience.\n\nMichael Carrick and his revitalised Reds simply can’t stop winning on and off the pitch right now.\n\nFeatured image Christopher Furlong via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "As a frequent traveler who's been around the world, I fell in love with Bali. The island is home to great food, warm people, and lots of things to do.",
    "fullText": "As an American who's traveled to 44 countries over the last 30 years, I've seen my fair share of unforgettable places.\n\nBut if I had to choose one place to visit again and again, it would be Bali, an island and province in Indonesia that combines vibrant culture, natural beauty, and a pace of life that feels both energizing and restorative.\n\nAfter spending a month on the island in 2023, I fell in love. Here's what made my trip to Bali so special.\n\nOne of my favorite meals during my time in Bali came from a street vendor. The Javanese meal, called Tahu Tek, featured fried tofu, bean sprouts, a thick peanut sauce, and a pile of crackers on top. It cost me less than $2 (USD), but it was packed with flavor.\n\nBali's food scene goes far beyond street food, though. Even dining at restaurants felt affordable, making it easy to try local specialties, including babi guling, a traditional whole roasted pig.\n\nPlus, I could easily find international cuisine alongside local dishes.\n\nI often went to Milk & Madu, which served American-style food like pizza and burgers. I also loved spending mornings at cafés in Canggu, sipping smoothies and enjoying breakfast bowls.\n\nOne of the main things that makes Bali truly special is its people. I've been to many destinations where the locals aren't always open to expats and travelers. But here, everyone I met was warm, welcoming, and genuinely kind.\n\nFor example, I used an app called Grab, similar to Uber, where drivers can pick up passengers on their motorbikes or in their cars.\n\nI was wary about riding on the back of a stranger's bike, but the friendly drivers I had across several rides quickly made me feel at ease. Some would even check in with me during the ride to make sure everything was OK or to ask if I needed them to slow down.\n\nPlus, I found an amazing community of digital nomads, creatives, and expats who decided to trade their office jobs for laptops in cafés. As an American living abroad, this made me feel at home.\n\nIt gave me a sense of familiarity in a new environment and made it easier to connect, since there was no language barrier. I felt more comfortable starting conversations and sharing experiences with other expats and long-term travelers.\n\nDuring my time in Uluwatu, I met another nomad, and a simple conversation turned into spending the next few days together exploring. These kinds of moments felt much more natural and common in Bali than in other places I've visited, and I felt a strong sense of openness and connection.\n\nAnother thing I loved about Bali was the diverse range of activities available. Whether I was in the mood to visit temples or relax on the beach, there was always something to do.\n\nFor example, in Ubud, I wandered through the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary, where ancient temples sit under jungle canopies. There were signs everywhere warning visitors to hold onto their belongings, and for good reason. The sanctuary is home to over 1,260 monkeys, who I saw climbing railings and jumping between statues.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, I also visited Alas Harum, a tourism destination in Tegallalang with lots of opportunities for adventure. Here, I flew out on a giant swing that went over rice fields. Taking in the view from way above the terraces was equal parts terrifying and fun.\n\nAnd when I wanted to relax, I visited the beach clubs, where I lounged by the water with music playing and a drink in my hand.\n\nAfter traveling to 44 countries, I can confidently say I'm no stranger to exploring new places.\n\nEvery destination I've visited has shown me new ways of living, but in Bali, I experienced a way of life that felt joyful, balanced, and connected. Plus, the tropical, warm, and consistent weather didn't hurt either.\n\nBetween the amazing food, the warm people, and the sense of adventure, I'm already dreaming of my next trip to this beautiful island.",

Hardee’s claimed the payments included franchise royalties, technology and training fees, rent and taxes and advertising contributions.\n\n“These closures are a result of ARC Burger’s failure to cure its defaults under its franchise agreements, despite solid sales and our continued attempts over the course of many months to reach a resolution that would keep these restaurants open,” Hardee’s said in a statement to USA Today.\n\nHardee’s was reportedly suing ARC Burger for $6.5 million it said were owed as part of its franchise agreements.\n\nThe locations were all set to close by the end of 2025, but there is some hope for loyal Hardee’s fans.

    "description": "Amanda Litman and her husband hosted 52 dinner parties in 2025. It helped them feel less lonely as parents in a big city.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Amanda Litman, 35, who lives in New York City. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn December 2024, my husband and I had a three-month-old and two-year-old daughter, and we felt lonely and isolated. Having kids is magical, but it's a lot.\n\nOver the first couple of years of parenthood, we realized that it was really hard to make plans and find time to have conversations with grown-ups. We used to joke that everyone was lonely, but no one could hang out.\n\nYou can chat to other parents at the playground or see them at pickup, but after having kids, you lose the spontaneity of being able to go to the movies or out to dinner, or to a party at the drop of a hat. Things become logistically difficult. We would always question, \"Is the thing we're invited to worth whatever it will cost us to go, plus $150 for a babysitter?\"\n\nWe wanted to create some kind of social anchor in our lives, and my husband suggested that we set a New Year's resolution to host people for dinner every Saturday in 2025.\n\nAt first, I was like, \"I think you're insane. That's a stupid thing to do.\" But he's the cook in our family, not me, so I agreed.\n\nWe made a list of everyone we know, or would like to know, or could possibly plausibly invite, used a spreadsheet as a schedule, and started texting people.\n\nWe'd say, \"Hey, we have a resolution to host people at our house every Saturday. Do you want to come over for dinner X, Y, or Z weekend at five o'clock? Bring the kids!\" And as people would say yes, we would go back and forth with scheduling, and put them on the calendar.\n\nWe live in a two-bedroom apartment in New York City, so we tried to keep the dinner parties relatively contained. Our table can fit up to six people at a stretch, but we also sat on the floor, we ate on our couch, and the kids would climb all over the place.\n\nMost of the time, we'd host between one and three families. Our biggest party had 15 guests (11 adults and four kids), and our smallest had one.\n\nWe had a mix of really longtime friends, new friends, and people we'd never spoken to for more than 20 minutes. Sometimes people knew each other and other times the guests had never met, so we got the chance to help new people connect.\n\nAfter a few weeks, we got into a pretty good rhythm. On Monday, I would message whoever was scheduled for that Saturday, confirming dinner and asking if they had any dietary restrictions.\n\nMy husband used that to figure out what to cook. He likes the opportunity to make something ambitious. Some of my favorites were his Gochujang caramel cookies, lemon bars, lasagna, and fried chicken.\n\nHe would go to the grocery store, then cook a little bit on Thursday night or bake if he was making dessert or bread. He would do a little bit more on Friday night after the girls went to bed, and more on Saturday morning while we fussed around the house and the kids played. When the kids napped, between 1 and 4 p.m-ish, he would finish cooking.\n\nPeople would come over at 5 p.m. and leave around 7 p.m., sometimes 9 p.m., and occasionally 10 p.m. We're 35-year-olds with kids, so it didn't go on until 2 a.m.\n\nEvery Saturday around 3 p.m., when my husband was in the weeds of cooking, worrying about not finishing in time, and the kids were misbehaving, we'd be like, \"Should we just cancel?\" But we never did.\n\nWe felt almost compulsive about keeping our streak alive, and by the end of the evening, we were always glad to have hosted.\n\nI would clean the bathroom and counters and make the house hygienic, not immaculate. It's not a museum, and we made sure that our guests understood that we're welcoming them into our home as imperfect.\n\nAll of our dishes are mismatched because they're from two households combined over the years. We used formula pitchers for water jugs. We're not fancy, but we decided that was fine.\n\nSome weekends it was hard to find people who were in town, and a couple times guests cancelled at the last minute and we had to scramble to invite more people. Sometimes the kids would be chaotic or we'd break a wine glass, but generally, it was manageable.\n\nIn this moment, I think, people feel very lonely, and I'm really glad that we were able to take meaningful actions to fix that in our lives.\n\nDoing this was good for my mental health. 2025 was a hard year. I had two kids under two, I released a book, and my job working in politics was very hard. But despite all of that, I had a social life, time with my family and friends, and a clean bathroom every week. Plus I got to eat a lot of good food.\n\nWhen people are over, I'm not looking at my phone, and I have real adult conversation, which is rare for me, especially outside of work. And some people who used to be just acquaintances are now friends, which I feel like is really hard to do when you're an adult.\n\nI think it was really meaningful to have this thing that we did every week without question. It was just like, \"this is what we do, who are we seeing this week?\"\n\nOne thing I struggled with was letting go of reciprocity. We invite people a lot, but they don't invite us back. I had to remind myself that doesn't mean they don't like us.\n\nEveryone has a different sense of comfort with hosting and with being the planner versus the guest. There's no moral valence to being an inviter, and letting go of keeping score was both hard and important.\n\nWe're very proud that we achieved our resolution, and we're going to try and keep doing it into 2026. We'll be less strict if folks cancel last minute, but we're booked through March right now.",

    "fullText": "The post Alaskan Moose Tower Over Grizzlies In Rare Wilderness Footage appeared first on A-Z Animals.\n\nConfronting a 1,808-pound Alaskan Yukon moose requires grizzlies to prioritize safety over apex dominance.\n\nAn 80-inch antler span creates a physical constraint that prohibits grizzlies from engaging in close-quarter combat.\n\n700-pound bears are often physically outmatched by the largest deer species on Earth.\n\nScouting the summer salmon runs at Brooks River is necessary to witness this specific predatory avoidance behavior.\n\nGrizzly bears are one of the few apex predators. They’re at the top of the food chain and will attack almost anything if they’re hungry enough. Brown bears are also known to be incredibly territorial. They share the wilderness with other animals, such as cougars, birds, coyotes, and more.\n\nA real wilderness location, Katmai National Park and Preserve, is located about 260 miles southwest of Anchorage. The Valley of 10,000 Smokes’ surreal volcanic beauty attracts some visitors, but bears are the main draw.\n\nThe park is home to over 2,200 brown bears, many of whom concentrate on the Brooks River to gorge on the summer salmon runs, making it one of the greatest places in Alaska to see bears. A YouTube channel by the name “Bradjosephs” was visiting the area when he saw something peculiar.\n\nMultiple bears were foraging by the river, looking for fresh salmon to eat. In the distant meadow, a giant moose appears. Even though bears are territorial, they’ll rarely attack a moose. It’s too dangerous, even for a wild animal as ferocious as a grizzly.\n\nThe two animals walk almost side-by-side at one point, giving us viewers an idea of just how big the moose is. The average grizzly bear weighs around 700 pounds. Males can weigh anywhere between 400 and 790 pounds, making them heavier than females. A big female might weigh anything between 290 and 400 pounds.\n\nThat’s huge! Grizzly bears are one of the largest land animals alive today. But as we can see in this footage, they look like teddy bears next to the gorgeous Alaskan moose. Female small-sized moose can weigh up to 800 pounds. Males of this size can weigh up to 1,600 pounds and grow as tall as about 6 feet.\n\nIt’s not unheard of for a bear to attack a moose, but the teddies in this video know better. They have plenty of fish to snack on while letting the moose safely pass by. It’s also not uncommon for moose to kill bears.\n\nMoose have been known to gore bears with their antlers, trample them underfoot, or rake them with their hooves. Moose are not hostile creatures. However, they still pose a threat. They will protect themselves if threatened. Grizzlies and polar bears are often not killed by moose, but they can cause significant harm to wolves, black bears, and coyotes, which are smaller prey.\n\nMoose and bears have the capacity to be deadly to people, depending on the circumstances. However, because they are predators, whereas moose are not, bears tend to be more dangerous. If you ever find yourself in a situation like this one, be sure to keep a safe distance from any wild animal.\n\nYes, bears normally stay away from fully-grown moose. Moose have very large antlers, and they can easily tear a grizzly bear apart, so bears usually leave moose alone. If it came to a fight, a grizzly bear would probably win, but it would be a tough fight, and the bear is smart enough to avoid it. See our article about this situation: Moose vs Bear: Who Would Win in a Fight?\n\nHowever, bears are commonly known to attack moose calves below the age of two months, as they do not have full-grown antlers to defend themselves.\n\nDuring the spring season, when grizzly bears just come out of hibernation, they are known to ignore their own instincts and attack an isolated moose or two.\n\nMoose in the wild typically have a lifespan of about 10-20 years. Bears, on the other hand, can live for much longer and may even reach 30 years old in some cases. The main threats to their survival are human activities such as hunting and habitat destruction due to deforestation or urbanization.\n\nOther natural predators also pose risks, especially for young moose or bear cubs, which are more vulnerable to predation than adults. Both species must also contend with environmental factors, such as harsh winters that can lead to malnutrition and disease, which can shorten their lives if not properly managed.\n\nIt’s no wonder grizzlies hesitate to take on a full-grown moose – they are gigantic! The Alaskan Yukon moose, the largest subspecies, can grow to a massive 1,808 pounds, stand up to 7.7 feet tall, and sport antlers more than 80 inches across. The height of a moose is measured at the shoulder – so its hoof-to-antler height could easily reach 10 feet! East Siberian moose are only slightly smaller – tipping the scales at 1,600 pounds.\n\nMoose are the largest species of deer, with an average Yellowstone bull standing over 6 feet tall and weighing around 1,000 pounds. Females are slightly smaller and tend to weigh around 800. So, even when considering the average-sized moose and the average-sized 500-pound grizzly – it’s easy to see why the typically lazy bear would hold off on such a risky, demanding fight. Only the hungriest grizzly eating for hibernation would even consider such – much less act on it.\n\nThe post Alaskan Moose Tower Over Grizzlies In Rare Wilderness Footage appeared first on A-Z Animals.",

    "fullText": "To fast or not to fast? That is the question many people ask before a cholesterol test.\n\nPatients used to be routinely instructed not to eat for at least eight hours before the screening, and some doctors still recommend that practice.\n\nBut fasting before lipid test is unnecessary for most people since the impact on cholesterol numbers is usually “negligible,” according to the Harvard Medical School.\n\nDr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver, has stopped asking his patients to fast before a cholesterol test.\n\n“You want to see what your numbers look like when you're living every day, not in some artificial state,” he tells TODAY.com.\n\nBut there’s one type of food the cardiologist recommends avoiding before the blood test.\n\n“The truth is, the only real parameter on the lipid panel that changes drastically and quickly is triglycerides,” Freeman says.\n\n“So I'd recommend that you not eat sweets and treats before you go for your lipid panel to avoid that spike in triglycerides.”\n\nBesides sugary foods and beverages, triglycerides are also dependent on white carbs, fatty foods and alcohol so the cardiologist would also avoid those foods and drinks immediately before his lipid panel.\n\nTriglycerides are the most common type of fat in the body, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.\n\nSome are needed for good health, but high levels of triglycerides can raise the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nA healthy level of triglycerides is below 150 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) for adults.\n\nBut about a quarter of Americans have levels that are too high. Those patients should always fast before a cholesterol test to get a more accurate measure of their triglycerides, experts at the Harvard Medical School note. That’s also how Freeman approaches lipid testing in his office.\n\nOther than skipping sweets and treats, most people can eat what they normally eat the night before a cholesterol test, Freeman says.\n\n“If you decide to eat nothing but kale for two weeks prior to your lipid panel, your triglycerides will probably be really low, and maybe your LDL could be a little lower,” he notes.\n\n“(But) your goal is to try to catch what you're like in the wild, in the real world.”\n\nHopefully, that includes lots of heart-healthy foods.\n\nAlways check with your doctor to see if you need to fast before a cholesterol test.\n\nTODAY’s Expert Tip of the Day series is all about simple strategies to make life a little easier.

Maple syrup. Lovely. First of all, I always have, for example, pancakes before a match. I just like pancakes and I always need to have maple syrup. Honestly, I eat this with everything.\n\nAlex: When was the last time you were actually at home in Canada?\n\nOlivia: Oh - probably in the summer, as I spent my Christmas here.\n\nAlex: What do you think of home? Can you build a picture for me of what life was like for you growing up back home?\n\nOlivia: I have a younger sister, so we grew up together. My family were all kind of goofballs I would say. So just playing games a lot, we're always outside, we have dogs as well. So I've grown up with dogs and just go to the park, play football, play with the dogs. That's kind of like what a typical day would look like.\n\nAlex: So your sister plays football?\n\nAlex: What position does she play?\n\nOlivia: Midfielder, winger, striker.\n\nAlex: So does she look up to you and want to follow in your footsteps?\n\nOlivia: I hope so, but she claims she's better than me!\n\nAlex: Does she literally watch your games and say \"You should have been doing this\" or \"You should have scored that goal\"?\n\nOlivia: Yes - she sends me snapchats of my game and says \"Why did you do that?\" I'm like, well, \"What would you have done?\"\n\nAlex: What did she think when you made your move to Arsenal?\n\nOlivia: She was so excited. I mean she also looks up to a team like Arsenal, she loves watching me play so then for me to get the opportunity and really be a role model for her playing with girls like Alessia [Russo] and Leah [Williamson], it's amazing. She's really excited for me.\n\nAlex: Who do you look up to back in Canada?\n\nOlivia: Christine Sinclair. She's a huge legend in the game of course, and also Marta. Then I love watching the men's game as well, so I was always looking up to Neymar, Ronaldinho, Messi, players like that.\n\nAlex: What did your family make of you playing football?\n\nOlivia: I think my dad really grew me into football and he kind of paved the way for me. He made so many sacrifices for me to be where I am today. I also wanted it and he could see that.\n\nAlex: How would your family and friends describe you?\n\nOlivia: Oh, ambitious, crazy... just attacking-minded. My dad always described me whenever I'd play as I'd just take the ball off my own team-mates to go score a goal!\n\nAlex: What was it like for you to make that transition when you finally moved away from Canada playing football?\n\nOlivia: It was quite tough, although I had been away from home for a bit before that. But going to Portugal, for example, it's a whole new world. Different language, different style of football. So having to learn that really on my own was quite tough. But the support system that I had around me was great, so I was able to adapt, I'd say, quite quickly, which is nice.\n\nAnd then, obviously, coming over to England, then that's a whole other environment, style of play, different kinds of people. And obviously it just takes a little bit [of time] to get comfortable. Once you make friends and you're happy, it makes a world of difference on the pitch and off the pitch.\n\nAlex: What would you say is the biggest thing you've learned about yourself?\n\nOlivia: I would say I always thought I was quite independent, but coming here and my ability to make relationships with people on my team and outside of football as well, it has really helped me to acclimatise to what life is like here.\n\nAlex: So we need to explain your background. The Jamaican food - your dad - Jamaican roots, right? And I learned your mum has Chilean and Peruvian roots. What was dinner like at home?\n\nOlivia: Dinner looks different pretty much every day and especially when my grandparents would come by to cook. That's when you know it's on top. So we'd have jerk chicken and my grandpa would make oxtail and my grandmother would make something called seco.\n\nOlivia: It's like a [Peruvian] meat stew and rice, and it's in a green sauce - it's really nice.\n\nAlex: And your grandads played football?\n\nAlex: So when they come round, were there football matches? Were you watching them?\n\nOlivia: I was always playing with them when we went on vacation to the Dominican - we always found a pitch and then we would play pick-up games with random people. My grandparents would join, I would join, my dad and my sister - it was always fun.\n\nAlex: What's your typical day off looking like?\n\nOlivia: It depends on the day and how I feel, but I do pretty much like to stay at home. I like to watch movies, binge watch, I also play video games as well. So, yeah, games, probably a little bit of shopping because I love to shop.\n\nAlex: Right. So if you're not playing football, you are..?\n\nAlex: If one song could be playing when you score a goal, what would it be?\n\nOlivia: I'm going to go with A Milli [by Lil Wayne] because I have that on my pre-match playlists. I think every game.\n\nAlex: The last thing you wrote in your phone notes was?\n\nOlivia: Oh. A bunch of numbers. I was playing an escape room game, so I needed to write down all these numbers so I could put it into a code.\n\nAlex: Since moving to England, what's one thing that you're just like \"I absolutely love this\"?\n\nOlivia: I fell in love with Yorkshire puddings and a Sunday dinner. It's my favourite thing - I absolutely love them now.\n\nAlex: Not many people love Yorkshire puddings.\n\nOlivia: Well, initially I wasn't sure. I was very hesitant because I had in my mind, like gravy on bread. And when I tried it for the first time I thought - how do you even describe Yorkshire puddings?\n\nAlex: Let's think about when we're looking ahead to the season, what are your goals and ambitions?\n\nOlivia: Ultimately, I want to become a better version of myself as a player. I know there's a lot of things I need to develop on, and being at Arsenal that will definitely help me. And ultimately I want to win things.\n\nAlex: Do you feel that you've settled in and the reasons that made you want to come to the club are starting to open up to you?\n\nOlivia: Yeah, 100%. I think the first couple of months it was a lot to really take in, but the girls have been amazing making me feel comfortable.\n\nAlex: Talk me through that first day when you arrived at Arsenal.\n\nOlivia: I was absolutely terrified, yeah, because every time we played Arsenal it was just a massive game. Obviously you never know what the environment is like from the outside, and I didn't know what to expect. And walking in, it was the complete opposite of what I thought it would be - everyone was just so welcoming.\n\nAlex: Who's the MVP, the person that if they weren't there tomorrow you'd be thinking \"this feels strange\"?\n\nOlivia: Less [Russo] really. She just has that personality and that vibe that you can feel at the training ground. It's just very comfortable and you can speak to her about anything. She's just very sweet.\n\nAlex: Renee [Slegers] has just signed a new three-year contract. In terms of the other managers that you've played for, how is she different?\n\nOlivia: She's just very ambitious and I feel like that goes for all around the club. Her values match [the club] and match the players as well, so I think that's just a really great thing to have, and also stability - knowing that she's going to be here for the next three years. To have a female empower us - I think that's her big thing as well, that she wants the players to feel empowered and use our voices - which every time that I've spoken to her I'm like, yeah, that's impressive.\n\nAlex: Do you know about my history with Renee? I used to be her teacher when she first came over. I was a teacher at the Arsenal Academy at the time so it's kind of full circle to see her go on to manage the team. She knows what being at the club means for everyone.\n\nAlex: Talking of the next thing, when you're looking at you and your career, what is it that you want to tick off? What do you want to achieve?\n\nOlivia: Oh, there's plenty of things I want to achieve. I want to win everything, ultimately. And again, the biggest thing is I just want to keep developing and growing as a person and a player. I think that's really important to me, just continue to develop my character, meeting more people and just learning.\n\nAlex: You said meeting more people. How have the Arsenal fans embraced you?\n\nOlivia: They've been amazing. I attended the [Arsenal Women fan engagement project] Block by Block, external consultation a couple of weeks ago where we discussed how we can make matchdays better.\n\nIt was really fun because I got to interact with the fans more on a personal level rather than them being up in the stands and just clapping - actually having a conversation and seeing what we can do to make the experience better for them, but also for us as players. Whether that's music, fireworks, just making it more fun.\n\nAlex: I bet the fans must have been buzzing. Did they know that you were turning up?\n\nOlivia: I'm actually not sure, but they seemed quite shocked when I pulled up!\n\nWatch: Arsenal v Chelsea in the Women's Super League on Saturday, 24 June (12:30 GMT) on BBC One and BBC iPlayer\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "For decades, McDonald's customers have complained that the fast-food giant reserves its most fun and innovative menu items for international markets, leaving its home country with the same predictable seasonal releases.\n\nAs frustrating as that may seem, there is a deliberate strategy behind this madness.\n\nMcDonald's tailors its menu in each country based on cultural preferences, ingredient availability, and what can be executed efficiently at scale. The same applies to limited-time and seasonal items.\n\nWhile menus vary around the world, a small set of core products remains consistent, including the World Famous Fries, the classic Hamburger and Cheeseburger, the Big Mac, McNuggets, and the Vanilla Cone.\n\nThis localization strategy reduces operational risk and improves return on investment, which is why each country maintains its own lineup with exclusive offerings.\n\nHistorically, McDonald's has taken a cautious approach to bringing international items to the U.S., testing them selectively and tailoring availability based on regional preferences and past performance. In most cases, localized items had stayed local.\n\nMcDonald's has revealed an entire lineup of international menu items coming to U.S. restaurants nationwide in 2026, marking one of the company's most ambitious cross-market rollouts in years.\n\nHere is the full list, with all items set to launch within the next few days.\n\nMcDonald's (MCD) first introduced its Hot Honey Sauce in Australia in March 2025, aiming to capitalize on what it described as \"the hottest trend everyone is talking about,\" according to a company press release. The sauce was later rolled out in New Zealand and Canada, each for a limited-time run.\n\nNow, less than a year later, it is headed to the U.S.\n\nThe Hot Honey Sauce blends honey with red bell peppers and cayenne peppers, finished with a hint of tangy vinegar. Alongside it, McDonald's is debuting three new menu items featuring the trendy sauce.\n\nHot Honey Bacon McCrispy: A crispy chicken filet topped with thick-cut applewood smoked bacon, crispy jalapeños, shredded lettuce, creamy mayo, and Hot Honey Sauce, served on a toasted potato roll \n\nHot Honey Snack Wrap: A McCrispy Strip topped with shredded cheese, shredded lettuce, and Hot Honey Sauce, all wrapped in a tortilla \n\nHot Honey Sausage Egg Biscuit: A pork sausage patty and a folded egg, topped with Hot Honey Sauce, on a biscuit brushed with real butter \n\nThe Hot Honey Sauce and all three new menu items will be available for a limited time beginning January 27 at participating U.S. locations and can be added to any menu item, according to the Snackolator Instagram page.\n\nAlthough the new products have not officially launched, they already appear on the McDonald's website.\n\nThe Big Arch burger debuted in Portugal in July 2024 and quickly gained traction, prompting McDonald's to expand it into Canada, Germany, Australia, the UK, Ireland, and France.\n\nDuring an earnings call in mid-2024, McDonald's acknowledged the burger's strong performance and universal appeal, which led it to accelerate its expansion.\n\n\"The pilot of our larger burger offering, Big Arch, now in three international markets, Portugal, Germany, and Canada, shows that we're listening to consumer tastes and delivering,\" said McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski in the earnings call.\n\n\"We'll work with franchisees and partners to deploy the Big Arch faster into more international markets in 2025.\"\n\nFollowing its positive reception abroad, McDonald's tested the Big Arch in the U.S. at its headquarters restaurant in Chicago for a limited time.\n\nThis massive burger features two quarter-pounder patties, three slices of white cheese, crispy onions, slivered onions, pickles, lettuce, and Big Arch Sauce, all sandwiched between a sliced sesame and poppy seed bun.\n\nWhile the Double Quarter Pounder comes close, it's not the same. McDonald's is positioning the Big Arch as a more premium, value-driven option.\n\nIn Canada, a Big Arch meal costs about $12.59, or roughly $9 in the U.S. Despite the higher price, the company says the burger delivers greater value, an increasingly important selling point as consumers grow more cautious of their spending.\n\nMcDonald's credits the Big Arch as a key traffic driver in several markets, helping boost global comparable sales by nearly 4% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nAfter extensive testing, the Big Arch will make its nationwide U.S. debut in early March 2026, according to The Street.\n\nLike much of the fast-food industry, McDonald's has faced mounting pressure in recent years, particularly in the U.S. Slower foot traffic, rising food costs, and weaker spending have weighed on results.\n\nPrices for food at home increased 2.6%, while prices for food away from home rose 3.7% in the 12 months ended September 2025, according to recent U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n\nMcDonald's making major drive-thru change\n\nMcDonald’s expected to bring back beloved childhood favorite in 2026\n\nFive Guys debuts alcohol and all-day breakfast\n\nDuring the quarter ending June 2025, foodservice traffic declined 1%, as consumers dined out less frequently, according to Circana. However, value menu traffic rose 1%, marking the first positive growth in three years.\n\nCircana also found that value-focused diners are 33% more likely than non-value buyers to purchase value menu items when visiting other restaurant chains, underscoring how aggressively consumers are hunting for savings and deals.\n\nIn response to consumers' cautious spending, McDonald's has rolled out several value-focused initiatives, including the Extra Value Meals, McValue menu, and $5 Meal Deals.\n\nIn March 2025, the company launched the Restaurant Experience Team, combining operations, supply chain, franchising, development, restaurant design, delivery, and Speedee Labs to drive innovation and efficiency. It also created three new global Category Management teams focused on beef, chicken, and beverages/desserts to further specialize innovation within its food products.\n\n“Value is rarely defined only by price,” said Circana Senior VP and Industry Advisor for Food and Foodservice David Portalatin in a statement. “Operational excellence in providing quality, affordability, great experiences, and convenience is what leads winning restaurants and their supply chain partners to greater success.”\n\nThose efforts are beginning to pay off. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, U.S. comparable sales increased 2.4%.\n\nDespite improvement, McDonald's remains cautious.\n\n\"We continue to remain cautious about the health of the consumer in the U.S. and our top international markets and believe the pressures will continue well into 2026,\" said McDonald's CEO Christopher J. Kempczinski in an earnings call.\n\n\"It’s a foundational expectation of our brand to bring consumers through our doors and keep them coming back.\"",

    "title": "The Indian couple who won a $200,000 settlement over 'food racism' at US university",
    "description": "The dispute began after the couple defended their right to heat palak paneer in a campus microwave.",
    "fullText": "A dispute that began over heating a dish in a microwave has ended with two Indian students winning a $200,000 settlement from a US university.\n\nAditya Prakash and his fiancee, Urmi Bhattacheryya, told the BBC they filed a civil rights lawsuit against the University of Colorado, Boulder, after they faced a series of \"microaggressions and retaliatory actions\" following the microwave incident.\n\nThe harassment began, the lawsuit alleged, after a university staff member objected to Prakash heating up his lunch of palak paneer - one of northern India's most popular dishes, made of pureed spinach and paneer (considered an Indian equivalent of cottage cheese) - in a microwave on campus, because of the way it smelled.\n\nIn response to the BBC's questions, the university said it could not comment on the \"specific circumstances\" surrounding the students' claims of discrimination and harassment due to privacy laws, but added it was \"committed to fostering an inclusive environment for all students, faculty and staff regardless of national origin, religion, culture and other classes protected under US laws and by university policies\".\n\n\"When these allegations arose in 2023, we took them seriously and adhered to established, robust processes to address them, as we do with all claims of discrimination and harassment. We reached an agreement with the students in September [2025] and deny any liability in this case,\" the university said.\n\nPrakash said for them, the point of the lawsuit was not the money. \"It was about making a point - that there are consequences to discriminating against Indians for their 'Indianness'.\"\n\nThe lawsuit has received significant media coverage in India since it was first reported last week, starting a conversation around what many have described as \"food racism\" in Western countries. Many Indians on social media have shared their own experiences of facing ridicule over their food habits abroad.\n\nSome have also pointed out that discrimination over food is rampant in India as well, where non-vegetarian food is banned in many schools and colleges over perceptions of it being impure or dirty. People from disadvantaged castes and north-eastern states often face bias over their food habits, with some complaining about the smell of the ingredients they use.\n\nAnd it's not just Indian or South Asian food - communities from Africa, Latin America and other parts of Asia have also shared their experiences of being shamed over their food habits.\n\nPrakash and Bhattacheryya claim their ordeal began in September 2023. Prakash, a PhD student in the Anthropology Department at the university, was microwaving his lunch of palak paneer when a British staff member allegedly remarked that his food was giving off a \"pungent\" odour and told him that there was a rule against heating foods with strong odours in that microwave.\n\nPrakash said the rule wasn't mentioned anywhere and when he later inquired about which foods were considered pungent, he was told that sandwiches were not, while curry was.\n\nPrakash alleged that the exchange was followed by a series of actions by the university which led to him and Bhattacheryya - who was also a PhD student there - losing their research funding, teaching roles and even the PhD advisers they had worked with for months.\n\nIn May 2025, Prakash and Bhattacheryya filed a lawsuit against the university, alleging discriminatory treatment and a \"pattern of escalating retaliation\" against them.\n\nIn September, the university settled the lawsuit. Such settlements are usually arrived at to avoid lengthy and expensive court battles for both parties.\n\nAccording to the terms of the settlement, the university agreed to give the students their degrees but denied all liabilities and banned them from studying or working there in future.\n\n'Indian food is terrible' tweet sparks hot debate\n\nIn its statement shared with the BBC, the university added: \"CU Boulder's Anthropology Department has worked to rebuild trust among students, faculty and staff. Among other efforts, department leaders met with graduate students, faculty and staff to listen and discuss changes that best support the department's efforts to foster an inclusive and supportive environment for all.\"\n\n\"Individuals who are determined to be responsible for violating university policies preventing discrimination and harassment are held accountable,\" it added.\n\nPrakash says that this isn't his first brush with discrimination over food.\n\nWhen he was growing up in Italy, his school teachers would often ask him to sit at a separate table during lunch breaks because his classmates found the smell of his food \"off-putting\", he says.\n\n\"Acts like isolating me from my European classmates or stopping me from using a shared microwave because of how my food smells are how white people control your Indianness and shrink the spaces you can exist in,\" he says.\n\nHe adds that there is a long history of food being used to put down Indian and other ethnic groups.\n\n\"The word 'curry' has been conflated with the 'smell' of marginalised communities who toil in kitchens and peoples' homes and has been turned into a pejorative term for 'Indian',\" he says.\n\nBhattacheryya says that even someone like former Vice-President Kamala Harris isn't immune to being insulted over food.\n\nShe points to a 2024 social media post by far-right activist Laura Loomer saying that if Harris became president, the White House \"will smell like curry\". Loomer has denied being racist.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Bhattacheryya also alleged she faced retaliation after she invited Prakash to speak as a guest lecturer on the topic of cultural relativism in her anthropology class. Cultural relativism is the view that no culture is superior or inferior to another as cultural practices of all groups exist within their own cultural context.\n\nDuring the lecture, Prakash says he shared several examples of food racism he had encountered, including the palak paneer incident, without naming anyone.\n\nBhattacheryya says that she also faced racist abuse when she posted a thread on X about the \"systemic racism\" she and Prakash were facing at the university in 2024.\n\nBelow the post, there are several comments supporting the couple but also ones that said, \"go back to India\", \"decolonisation was a mistake\" and \"it's not just the food, many of you don't bathe and we know\".\n\nPrakash and Bhattacheryya said what they wanted from the university was to be heard and understood; for their hurt and pain at being \"othered\" to be acknowledged and for amends to be made in a meaningful way.\n\nThey claim that they never received a meaningful apology from the university. The university did not respond to the BBC's question about this.\n\nThey have since returned to India and say that they might never go back to the US.\n\n\"No matter how good you are at what you do, the system is constantly telling you that because of your skin colour or your nationality, you can be sent back any time. The precarity is acute and our experience at the university is a good example of this,\" Prakash says.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "fullText": "On top of being a legendary musician and fashion icon, Dolly Parton is also a great chef.\n\nThe country-music star has shared plenty of her cooking secrets with me, including her hack for making the fluffiest scrambled eggs and the unique ingredient she uses to elevate her mac and cheese.\n\nParton also revealed what she loves whipping up in the kitchen for her goddaughter, Miley Cyrus.\n\n\"Miley and I both love Southern food like mashed potatoes, coleslaw, and a big ol' hunk of cornbread — making cornbread muffins or a big pan of it with the squares,\" Parton told me.\n\nI loved trying Parton's Taco Bell order. So when I stumbled on her cornbread recipe, I knew I had to give it a go.\n\nInstead of cooking full bacon strips, I cut the bacon into small pieces and spread them out in my 9-inch skillet so they would render evenly.\n\nI cooked my bacon over medium-low heat until it turned crispy and I could see plenty of drippings at the bottom of the pan. Then, I removed the pieces, letting them rest on a plate lined with a paper towel. Parton said the skillet should be covered with extra bacon drippings, so I didn't wipe it clean after I finished cooking.\n\nYou could easily whip up Parton's recipe after you've made breakfast, or save the bacon to eat alongside her cornbread. Either way, it's a win-win.\n\nFirst, I added two cups of the self-rising cornmeal to a large bowl.\n\nThe first recipe I found online actually called for two tablespoons of bacon drippings instead of two teaspoons. I didn't realize Parton's recipe was different before I made the cornbread again, so I accidentally added extra.\n\nThe flavor still came out great, so feel free to add more bacon drippings if you wish.\n\nParton recommends gradually adding the buttermilk while stirring everything with a wooden spoon. You'll know the batter is ready when it's thick but smooth.\n\nBarely 10 minutes of prep had passed, and my cornbread was ready to go into the oven.\n\nI threw my skillet into the oven at 425 degrees Fahrenheit and let it cook for 25 minutes. Parton says you'll know the cornbread is ready if it springs back when you tap it.",

Kraft Heinz warned investors Tuesday that Berkshire Hathaway may be interested in selling its 325 million shares in the name brand food giant that Buffett helped create back in 2015.  Buffett and the Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital orchestrated the merger of Kraft and Heinz back then because they already owned Heinz and believed in the power of their brands.",
    "fullText": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Warren Buffett's successor appears to be considering his first significant move after taking over as CEO this month.\n\nKraft Heinz warned investors Tuesday that Berkshire Hathaway may be interested in selling its 325 million shares in the name brand food giant that Buffett helped create back in 2015. The news came in a filing with stock market regulators.\n\nBuffett and the Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital orchestrated the merger of Kraft and Heinz back then because they already owned Heinz and believed in the power of their brands. Now Greg Abel may be plotting a different course.\n\nOver the years since Buffett had come to realize that the company's competitive moat around its brands wasn't as strong as he thought as consumers have increasingly been willing to switch to store brands and move away from processed foods. Berkshire took a $3.76 billion writedown on its Kraft-Heinz stake last summer. Buffett said last fall that he was disappointed in Kraft Heinz' plan to split the company in two, and Berkshire's two representatives resigned from the Kraft board last spring.\n\nBut still it was rare for Buffett to unload an acquisition during his six decades leading Berkshire even when he soured on a business' prospects. Berkshire didn't respond to questions Tuesday about the filing where Kraft Heinz disclosed that its largest shareholder “may offer to sell, from time to time, 325,442,152 shares.” Kraft Heinz shares fell nearly 4% to $22.85 after the announcement.\n\nThere's no sign Berkshire has started selling yet, but CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert wonders if this could be just the beginning of a comprehensive review of Berkshire's varied holdings. In addition to its massive stock portfolio worth over $300 billion, Berkshire owns an assortment of insurers including Geico, several utilities, BNSF railroad and an eclectic mix of manufacturing and retail companies.\n\n“My sense is that Greg Abel’s leadership style may be a departure from Buffett’s, and this sale, if completed, would represent a shift in corporate mindset,” Seifert said. \"Berkshire under Buffett typically only made acquisitions- not divestitures. It's not inconceivable, in our view, that Abel may likely assess every Berkshire subsidiary and decide to jettison those that do not meet his internal hurdles.“\n\nOf course Abel already knows many of Berkshire's companies well because he has been managing all of the non-insurance companies since 2018. But he only became CEO on Jan. 1. Buffett remains chairman, but investors are watching closely for any changes Abel might make at the venerable conglomerate.",

    "description": "Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said customers might see fiber creep into the company's drinks this year.",
    "fullText": "Coca-Cola's CEO said the drinks company is looking at one viral health trend this year.\n\nSpeaking with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, CEO James Quincey said fiber might be the next big thing for Coca-Cola.\n\n\"So you've got a lot of focus on refreshment and a lot of focus on protein, and people are definitely seeing more protein,\" Quincey said. \"We might see fiber creep in this year.\"\n\nHe said fiber can be put into anything because it's soluble in beverages. He gave the example of the Diet Coke Fiber+ drink from Coca-Cola, which has been available in Japan since 2017.\n\nThe drink is advertised as sugar- and calorie-free, with five grams of dietary fiber per bottle.\n\nThe drink was part of a \"fast-growing segment where ingredients are added to beverages to address specific dietary needs,\" Quincey said in 2017.\n\nHowever, he said on Tuesday's Squawk Box that Diet Coke Fiber+ was still a \"niche\" drink, because \"people don't buy drinks to have their fiber.\"\n\nQuincey's comments echo those of other food and beverage executives who have predicted the rise of fiber this year.\n\nMcDonald's CEO, Chris Kempczinski, took to Instagram last week to predict his top three food trends for 2026, and the first item on the list was fiber. He said fiber was \"going to be big\" this year.\n\nPepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta predicted in an October earnings call that \"fiber will be the next protein.\"\n\nThe term \"fibermaxxing\" was a viral health trend on social media in 2025, with dieticians saying that it helps aid gut health, lower cholesterol, and reduce the risk of colon cancer.\n\nAnd cabbage, a fiber-rich vegetable, is having its moment on social media, with Pinterest predicting that the vegetable would trend highest on social media in the US in 2026.\n\nPinterest released its annual trends report in December, which showed that the search term \"cabbage dumplings\" rose 110% from September 2024 to August 2025, compared to the same period the year before.",

    "description": "He isn't known for having the most refined palate, so it's no surprise that President Donald Trump eats this instead of the fancy food at state dinners.",
    "fullText": "A White House insider shared the go-to meal that President Donald Trump likes to fill up on before attending formal engagements with esteemed guests, and to absolutely no one's surprise, it's a burger. In an episode of the Daily Beast's show \"Inside Trump's Head,\" journalist Michael Wolff said the president eats a burger meal prior to attending state dinners. He reportedly pokes at the fancy food he's routinely served on the job, using the strategy of talking constantly to distract other attendees from noticing that he's barely eating.\n\nTrump has a well-documented love affair with fast food, dating back to his first term when he served a spread of burgers and pizza to the Clemson University football team after they won the college national championship. He favored fast food on the campaign trail for his second term, even stopping to pose for a now-famous photo op with McDonald's fries in hand. Trump has reportedly reasoned that eating fast food makes him relatable to average Americans.\n\nThe president's association with fast food earns him both praise and criticism. With his long history of showmanship, some observers, such as the users on Reddit's r/Pics, have even questioned whether his preferences are authentic or endorsed. But as Wolff confirmed, Trump's love for burgers is the real thing — even behind closed doors.\n\nFurther into the episode of \"In Trump's Head,\" Wolff reveals that staff traveling with Trump aboard Air Force One are given care packages of fast food as perks of the job. Apparently, most staff members don't eat the White House food, which Wolff describes as being bland and mass produced in banquet fashion — similar to something served at a wedding. When host Joanna Coles read through a menu of courses served at a 2018 state dinner in honor of French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron, Wolff replied that Trump would not have touched any of it.\n\nWhile it's not uncommon for what President Trump eats in a typical day to end up in the news or even his personal social media, perhaps lesser known is the fact that former presidents and their inner circles also favored burgers and fries. Fast food appears to have been woven into the culture in Washington for decades. Our list of other politicians who are obsessed with fast food includes Bill Clinton, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Ted Cruz, and others. Most figures on our list are noted to blur the lines between business and pleasure when it comes to their love of fast food, similar to the way Trump does.\n\nFor more food and drink goodness, Get taste tests, food & drink news, deals from your favorite chains, recipes, cooking tips, and more!",

    "description": "I ordered chicken fingers at fast-food chains Chick-fil-A, Zaxby's, and PDQ. They were all good, but my favorite ones were crispy and well-seasoned.",
    "fullText": "In my opinion, fried chicken tenders are as American as apple pie.\n\nHowever, every fast-food restaurant has its own take on the classic staple, so I decided to visit three chains — Zaxby's, PDQ, and Chick-fil-A — to see how their offerings compared.\n\nHere's what I thought of the chicken tenders at each spot.\n\nTo kick things off, I stopped by my local Chick-fil-A. The brand, which first opened in Atlanta in 1967, now has more than 3,000 locations across the US, Puerto Rico, and Canada.\n\nWhen I stepped inside, I ordered the three-count chicken strips, which cost me $5.45.\n\nI enjoyed the Chick-Fil-A chicken tenders because they were crispy and had the right amount of seasoning.\n\nThey were also reasonably priced for such a decent portion size.\n\nAfter visiting Chick-Fil-A, I traveled to a nearby to PDQ, a chain restaurant known for its chicken tenders, salads, and sandwiches.\n\nThe first PDQ opened in Tampa in 2011, and the chain now has 42 locations, most of which are in Florida. However, there are also a few restaurants in North Carolina and New Jersey.\n\nHere, I ordered three crispy chicken tenders for $7.\n\nThe PDQ tenders were tasty, and they appeared to be a little larger than the ones I got from Chick-fil-A.\n\nWhen I bit into one, the inside was so tender it fell apart. Although this made them a little harder to eat, I was impressed by how fresh they seemed.\n\nI also thought they were seasoned nicely.\n\nFinally, I visited Zaxby's, a fast-food chain that specializes in chicken fingers and wings. Founded in 1990 in Statesboro, GA, the chain now has more than 900 locations, mostly in the South and Midwest.\n\nTo get the most for my money, the cashier suggested I order a kid's meal, which came with two chicken tenders, fries, a rice krispie treat, and a drink for $5.70.\n\nWhen I took a bite, I thought these chicken tenders tasted salty. This made sense because after looking at each restaurant's nutrition information online, it seemed as though the Zaxby's chicken contained the most sodium.\n\nDespite that, though, they were pretty flavorful. Although they appeared to have less seasoning on them than the ones I got at PDQ, I still tasted a hint of pepper. They were cooked perfectly too, and very tender.\n\nHowever, because of the salty flavor, these tenders were my least favorite of the three I tried.\n\nWhen it comes to plain, crispy, fried chicken tenders, Chick-fil-A was the clear winner. These had the right amount of seasoning, were reasonably priced, and came in the perfect portion size.\n\nI can definitely see myself returning to Chick-fil-A for \n\nThis story was originally published on April 17, 2025, and most recently updated on January 20, 2026.",

    "title": "Everything an Olympic champion eats in a day to get enough protein and fiber — without overthinking it",
    "description": "Olympic swimmer Katie Ledecky generally follows a whole food diet, focusing on homemade dinners and veggie omelets.",
    "fullText": "For being the most decorated female swimmer in Olympic history, Katie Ledecky's philosophy around nutrition is surprisingly relaxed.\n\nFor one, she doesn't strictly track her daily protein intake. \"Over the years, I've kind of learned what I need because it does sometimes change, if I'm doing well or if I don't feel like I'm doing well,\" Ledecky, 28, told Business Insider.\n\nSince graduating from Stanford in 2020, her class-free schedule also gives her more time to rest and cook her own meals between her two blocks of daily training sessions. To keep things simple, she eats mostly the same breakfasts every day and usually has leftovers from the previous night's dinner for lunch.\n\n\"I just focus on things that I can prep easily,\" Ledecky said. \"My morning is pretty much set. I don't even have to think about it very much.\"\n\nLedecky shared what she typically eats in a day to fuel for and recover from long training sessions.\n\nLedecky typically wakes up at 5:00 a.m. for her first practice of the day, a 6 to 8 a.m. block involving swimming and strength training.\n\nBefore she heads out, she eats \"something quick and not anything too heavy,\" usually an oatmeal packet and a banana. The carbohydrates from both provide an energy boost.\n\nRight after practice, Ledecky usually has a Core Power protein shake, for whom she's a brand ambassador for, to tide her over until she gets home for breakfast.\n\n\"I try to get a full meal in within an hour of when I finish practice,\" she said, as the body is best optimized for nutrient intake after a hard workout. \"That was something I learned from a young age.\"\n\nBreakfast is usually two eggs, scrambled or cooked in an omelet. Ledecky, who is partnered with the egg brand Eggland's Best, said she grew up eating Eggland's eggs in particular since she was a kid, continuing to include them as a staple of her diet as an adult.\n\nShe loves making a vegetable omelet because of how easy it is to add extra fiber-rich ingredients like spinach, arugula, or tomatoes. She usually tops with cheese like mozzarella or cheddar.\n\nShe always adds a side of toast and fruit. \"So I'm kind of getting a good balance there of protein and carbs and everything that I need,\" she said.\n\nLedecky has a late lunch or larger snack before her second practice of the day, another two-hour training block in the afternoon.\n\n\"Usually, that's leftovers from dinner the night before, or a salad, or some chicken,\" she said.\n\nThroughout the day, she also likes to snack on berries, which offer fiber and extra nutrients.\n\n\"I love blueberries, raspberries, strawberries,\" she said. \"I always feel good when I'm having a mix of fruit throughout the day as well in between all my meals.\"\n\nAfter practice, Ledecky makes dinner — her most involved meal-prep of the day. She focuses on protein-rich meals, which help with building muscle and recovery.\n\n\"That's kind of when I mix up a little bit more,\" she said. \"Might be steak, might be chicken, might be a hamburger, might be pasta.\"\n\nLedecky has a few favorite desserts in rotation.\n\nShe keeps frozen yogurt and ice cream in her freezer whenever she wants a scoop at night. Sometimes, she goes to her favorite bakery in Florida for a pastry.\n\n\"I treat myself every now and then,\" she said. \"It just kind of depends on what I'm craving.\"",

    "description": "Ina Garten has dozens of delicious soup recipes. Her tomato soup with grilled cheese croutons is super easy to make and perfect for any age.",
    "fullText": "After cooking my way through Ina Garten's comforting pastas, energizing breakfasts, and delectable desserts, it was time for a new challenge.\n\nAs George Costanza would say, I was ready to \"shift into soup mode.\"\n\nGarten has dozens of soup recipes, and I've been slowly making my way through her repertoire. Each soup in this ranking is delicious — what else would you expect from the Barefoot Contessa? — but I definitely have some clear favorites.\n\nGarten's minestrone soup appears in her 2012 cookbook \"Foolproof.\" In the recipe's description, she calls it an \"incredibly hearty winter soup\" that \"falls somewhere between a soup and a stew.\"\n\nThe soup is packed with tons of vegetables — baby spinach, butternut squash, celery, carrots, garlic, and onion — plus cannellini beans, pancetta, pesto, Parmesan, and fresh thyme.\n\nIt requires a lot of chopping and prep, but all those veggies provide plenty of heft.\n\nFull transparency, if I had to rank my favorite soups in the world, minestrone would always be at the bottom of the list. Most minestrone soups I've tried have been lackluster and forgettable, but Garten's version is a commendable effort.\n\nThe chopped tomatoes and pancetta bring some richness to the broth, while the rainbow of veggies provides plenty of color and texture. I loved the pops of freshness from the spinach and thyme, and the salty kick from the Parmesan on top.\n\nWhile it's not my favorite Barefoot Contessa recipe, Garten's winter minestrone soup is healthy and hearty.\n\nHow to make Ina Garten's winter minestrone soup.\n\nGarten loves putting a new twist on classic recipes, and her Italian wedding soup is no different. Featured in Garten's 2008 cookbook \"Back to Basics,\" the recipe features meatballs made with a mixture of ground chicken and chicken sausage instead of the traditional beef or pork.\n\nThe recipe also includes small pasta — Garten recommends tubettini or stars — carrots, celery, fresh dill, baby spinach, and her homemade chicken stock.\n\nGarten says using homemade chicken stock \"makes all the difference in the world\" for this recipe, and I definitely agree.\n\nHer delicious stock infuses this dish with depth, giving the broth richness without making it heavy. This allows the soup to taste light and fresh, especially with the added burst of dill. The chicken meatballs were full of great flavor. I just wish I had made them a tad smaller!\n\nGarten's Italian wedding soup isn't as memorable as other recipes on this list, but it's a great dish for rainy nights.\n\nHow to make Ina Garten's Italian wedding soup.\n\nGarten made traditional chili for 20 years at the famous specialty food store that launched her cooking career (and gave her the iconic \"Barefoot Contessa\" nickname). But she decided to update the chili with chicken to make it lighter, which became even more popular than the original dish.\n\nThe soup — which is featured in Garten's 2001 cookbook \"Barefoot Contessa Parties!\" — features chicken breasts, red and yellow bell peppers, onion, garlic, fresh basil, plus toppings including green onions, sour cream, and grated cheddar cheese.\n\nWhen I'm craving chili, I usually whip up this recipe with ground beef that my fiancé and I have been making for years. But if you're looking for something a little lighter, Garten's recipe is a great substitute.\n\nThe tender and juicy roasted chicken pairs deliciously with the rich tomato flavor of the broth, and I enjoyed the crunchy texture from the bell peppers and the green onions on top. The sour cream also adds a nice hit of creaminess and acidity.\n\n\"This chili is reminiscent of a chicken tortilla soup, but it's so much heartier!\" my friend Kayla said after I made her a bowl. \"It makes you feel so warm and cozy.\"\n\nHow to make Ina Garten's chicken chili.\n\nGarten elevates her version of tomato soup — which also appears in \"Foolproof\" — with the addition of orzo, saffron threads, and grilled cheese croutons.\n\nThis is one of the quickest Barefoot Contessa soup recipes. There's very minimal prep, and the entire dish is ready in just 50 minutes!\n\nTomato and grilled cheese are a pairing as classic as peanut butter and jelly or macaroni and cheese, and turning the sandwich into bite-sized croutons is an inspired choice. I loved how they injected each sip of soup with a salty and satisfying blast of gooey cheesiness.\n\nI used Garten's homemade chicken stock for this recipe, which helps imbue the broth with so much flavor despite being on the stove for less than an hour. It's light and rich, with a silky texture I couldn't get enough of. This is the only tomato soup that I crave now.\n\nHow to make Ina Garten's tomato soup with grilled cheese croutons.\n\nAs you can see, Garten clearly loves to whip up Italian soup recipes. The Barefoot Contessa version of ravioli en brodo appears in \"Go-To Dinners,\" Garten's most recent cookbook.\n\nThe rustic recipe features homemade chicken stock, fresh or frozen cheese ravioli, carrots, celery, fennel, dill, lemon juice, and Parmesan cheese.\n\nGarten's ravioli en brodo turned me into a true homemade chicken stock convert. With its help, the broth in this soup truly tastes like liquid gold. It's light but silky, rich and savory. The dill and lemon add an extra burst of brightness, while the ravioli brings in that comforting cheesiness.\n\nI dream about this soup so much, I think it's safe to say I prefer it over chicken noodle. And now I make a huge pot of homemade chicken stock every winter.\n\nHow to make Ina Garten's ravioli en brodo.\n\nGarten was inspired to make a chicken pot pie soup after she spotted one on an airport menu.\n\n\"It was actually harder to make than it sounded — my first few attempts just tasted like chicken pot pie filling, not soup,\" she wrote in her 2020 cookbook \"Modern Comfort Food.\"\n\n\"This one, though, hit all the right comforting notes, with good chicken stock, roasted chicken, and puff pastry croutons,\" Garten added.\n\nThe soup also features carrots, leeks, fennel, garlic, pearl onions, peas, fresh tarragon and parsley, plus some cream sherry.\n\nI wish I knew which airport restaurant had the chicken pot pie soup on its menu so I could personally thank them for inspiring Garten's version, which has become one of my favorite comfort meals.\n\nThis recipe keeps the spirit of pot pie alive with deliciously juicy and tender chicken surrounded by fresh and flavorful veggies with every sip. The puff pastry croutons were an easy and quick addition, and they tasted incredible after soaking up the delicious broth.\n\nWhen one of my loved ones is sick, this is always the dish that I make for them. It's truly soup for the soul.\n\nHere's how to make Ina Garten's chicken pot pie soup.",

Many of the games are perfect for players of all ages, those who are new to gaming, and people looking for a casual experience with friends. As long as you don't cry over split milk, you'll get a lot out of these culinary co-op classics.\n\nIf you like a co-op experience but can't stand to use the kitchen when someone else is in there (valid), check out our best couch co-op games list for similar vibes without the foodie flavour.\n\nOvercooked! All You Can Eat is often the first name that comes up when people talk about co-op cooking games, and for good reason. This collection brings together multiple Overcooked experiences into one package, focusing entirely on the cooperative chaos offered by the franchise. Players work together to prepare, cook, and serve dishes across a series of increasingly absurd kitchens, many of which actively interfere with your ability to function as a team, so pretty standard for the catering industry.\n\nIdeal for players who enjoy fast-paced action and don’t mind getting a little heated in the kitchen, Overcooked! All You Can Eat is especially well-suited for local co-op sessions, where you can embrace your inner Gordon Ramsay and get your point across in an instant. This edition also features an assist mode, where several accessibility options mean everyone can join in, whatever their chef-ing ability. Overcooked also made it onto our best Xbox co-op games list, and works flawlessly either locally or online.\n\nGameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom\n\nYou can probably guess the premise of One Armed Cook without much prompting: you're a cook and you have one arm. But the simple concept gives way to hours of physics-based fun when you consider that between you and a friend, you'll have all the required arms. The game very quickly goes from \"I'm not doing too badly, considering,\" to \"oh my god the floor is covered in onions,\" so if you want the video game equivalent of a three-legged race, you don't have to look much further.\n\nCarrying ingredients, chopping food, and assembling dishes often requires both of you working in sync, especially when dealing with awkward customers or a full house. One Armed Cook is best enjoyed by pals who appreciate goofy, unpredictable gameplay and don’t mind failing spectacularly on the way to success.\n\nPlateUp! blends the more traditional elements of co-op cooking with light restaurant management, meaning it's as much about planning ahead as it is about the actual execution of each dish. It's another of the more popular entries on the list, but continues to prove itself in the multiplayer arena, even against more recent games. Players work together to run a restaurant over 15 in-game days, choosing layouts, upgrading equipment, and deciding how to handle increasingly demanding customers. Every three days, you then have to choose a card that will permanently impact the game from there on--sometimes for the worse.\n\nUnlike more linear level-based cooking games, PlateUp! leans toward rogue-lite mechanics, changing things up with every full game. Decisions made early--such as kitchen layout or menu/card choices--directly affect later runs. Cooking, serving, cleaning, and managing customer flow all happen simultaneously, making teamwork essential and genuinely challenging.\n\nDiner Bros 2 asks a lot of you, so if you want a co-op cooking game with a bit of bite, this is the one for you. Alongside serving up delicious dishes, you'll have to keep enhancing your restaurant, optimizing its layout, impressing food critics, learning new recipes, hiring staff, and even dealing with sneaky customers who try to dine-n-dash. There are no gimmicks or environmental hazards, just good honest work and the potential of a thriving business driving you forward.\n\nThe game emphasizes clear task-division, meaning it's best with four friends, but can also be played alone (by hiring staff) or with two players. One player might focus on blasting through all the cooking while another handles serving and cleanup, but the most effective teams adjust roles dynamically depending on customer flow. Progression unlocks new content, encouraging players to improve efficiency and coordination over time, so you'll find plenty of replayability here, too.\n\nGalaxy Burger is a little different from many of the games on this list, as there's no frantic energy and no chaotic time limits. It's a laid-back game with no stress, where you and up to seven friends can create cosmic burgers for aliens, space creatures, and mecha cats. Different burgers require different ingredients and combinations, meaning you'll be prepping all manner of accompaniments, toppings, and side dishes to complete challenges.\n\nIf you're sick of cooking co-op games making you frustrated, stressed, or even downright angry, Galaxy Burger offers an alternative in chilled, casual cooking in which gentle creativity is rewarded. Galaxy Burger doesn’t reinvent the genre, but it adds enough thematic flair to keep teamwork feeling fresh. Plus, some of the cats are really cute.\n\nWitchtastic handles like a co-op cooking game, but throws in a witchy twist by having you and your pals brew potions instead of preparing food. Speed is the key, as you want those potions flying out of there ASAP. While there is a single-player campaign, it's a lot more fun to team up and scurry around increasingly elaborate cooking setups.\n\nIf you're a big fan of cozy games, Witchtastic might appeal with its cottagecore cauldron-in-a-forest vibes--just watch out for ghouls, wolves, and other halloween-y horrors that might distract you from your noble pursuit. Between foraging, scooting about on a broomstick, and customising your witch, there's always something to do between brewing sessions.\n\nCook Serve Delicious 3 is a lot to explain. It's a co-op cooking game set in dystopian future America where cyborgs mingle with humans--and instead of freaking out about this, you're taking your food truck on a road trip. If there is such a thing, this is basically the Dark Souls of cooking games, so if you want something that'll pose a genuine challenge to you and your friends (perhaps to knock a smug pal down a peg or two), you'll want to check the series out. It's one of those great two-player co-op games that'll reward you handsomely if you reach its incredibly high bar for challenge.\n\nSingle-player is supported in the campaign, but local co-op is where Cook Serve Delicious 3 really shines. Between rounds, you'll upgrade and customize your food truck, expand your menu, and travel across the war-torn future USA, before launching into another round of trying to cater to the hungry masses. When on-shift, you and your friends will have to coordinate almost seamlessly in an unforgiving onslaught of demanding customers. The game packs a ridiculous 387 levels, so you've got plenty of time to hone those chopping, flipping, and frying skills.\n\nLet’s Cook Together 2 is a wholesome co-op game that can be played with just about anyone, but works best with younger kids. The game rewards cooperative puzzle-solving and well-timed cooking collaboration, with kitchens designed as challenges that require players to coordinate movements, timing, and task execution to complete recipes efficiently. It's a great introduction to co-op gaming for your less-experienced kids or siblings, and offers more than 250 levels to try.\n\nFast reflexes aren't much of a consideration in Let's Cook Together 2's lower difficulty levels; you just need to be able to communicate, plan ahead, and support each other. Everything you need to serve up your dishes is scattered across a wide room, so sometimes you're going to have to throw stuff with perfect timing.\n\nShakes on a Plane centers on cooperative milkshake-making in unusual environments, but we'll loosely group milkshakes into cooking for now. Players work together to fulfill orders while dealing with airplane kitchens that move, tilt, or change unexpectedly, as they gain altitude and deal with turbulence, demanding passengers, and even aliens.\n\nThe game thrives on shared chaos, and although it does offer single-player, we personally think it's not the best way to play it. Having multiple players support you in co-op makes it easier and more engaging, allowing you to progress at a comfortable pace. At its heart it's a fairly cluttered Overcooked clone, but the unique concept and fun setting make it a good alternative party game if you're not afraid of heights.\n\nBone’s Cafe combines cooperative cooking with a creepy-cute aesthetic, tasking players with running a cafe filled with undead workers and patrons. Players work together to preparing dishes, serving customers, and managing shared responsibilities--as well as literally raising the dead.\n\nCoordination and timing are hugely important, with progression introducing new recipes and challenges that require better teamwork. Decorate and upgrade your cafe, and increase your Skull Ranking for better rewards, all while trying to automate and streamline your work. The cute pixel art belies the fact that your job is to strategically attract, kill, and harvest customers for fresh ingredients and use their souls to raise an undead army. Adorable.",

    "title": "We spent $145 to eat like finance bros at Tommy Bahama and are shocked to admit we get the appeal — but not the food",
    "description": "Tommy Bahama's restaurant is popular for a business lunch. We ate there to see why — and left simultaneously underwhelmed and somewhat sold.",
    "fullText": "The Tommy Bahama on 45th Street and 5th Avenue bills itself on its website as \"an oasis in the big city,\" a \"refuge\" that's \"ideal for business lunches.\" Geographically, it makes total sense — on foot, Tommy Bahama is six minutes from JPMorgan's new tower, nine minutes from Bank of America Tower, five minutes from a PWC building, and 12 minutes from the main Morgan Stanley office.\n\nWe'll spare you the full list of adjacent corporate headquarters.\n\nWe had a 12:30 p.m. reservation, and the restaurant kept filling up throughout our meal. Diners eventually sat at the bar, and when I, Alice, went to the bathroom around 1:20 p.m., a gaggle of waiters was congregating by the kitchen, discussing table numbers over a window crammed with burgers and salads.\n\nApart from the kitchen, though, the crowded restaurant didn't feel cramped. Tables were far enough apart that we couldn't hear others' conversations, yet the background din of conversation made the room feel lively. The only deal talk we overheard came from a woman on her way out, who mentioned her interest in bringing ESRT, the company that owns the Empire State Building, on as a client.\n\nSo when it comes to layout, it's not a bad spot for a semi-private, relatively casual business lunch.\n\nFor a restaurant in Midtown Manhattan, the price point wasn't too surprising, but it seemed more suited to dinner than lunch. The cheapest item in the entrée section was $31.\n\nOne table of four almost entirely ordered the macadamia-nut-crusted fresh catch, and our waitress said the ahi tuna poke bowl was also a popular lunch choice. There were also a number of salad orders around the restaurant, which seemed fitting for lunch.\n\nThe $23 \"world-famous\" coconut shrimp appetizer arrived at our table fairly quickly — it was the only item we knew we had to try during our visit.\n\nThe shrimp sat atop a papaya and mango chutney, adding another layer of sweetness to the coconut coating. The cabbage salad that sat on top was our favorite part of the plate. The coleslaw was dressed with a light vinaigrette, and the cilantro added a nice freshness.\n\nUltimately, though, the overall dish was too sweet for our liking, and we left some lonely shrimp on the plate.\n\nI, Jordan, admit that I'm a newbie to ordering French dip sandwiches. I was expecting mine to come with caramelized onions and Swiss cheese. For $33, the Tommy Bahama wagyu French dip came with neither, despite the description listing sweet-and-sour onions as an ingredient.\n\nThe missing onions aside, I found myself taking some of the sliced beef off to make the sandwich a little easier to bite into. I felt kind of silly picking the valuable wagyu out of my sandwich, but I wanted to be able to close it properly. The broth was good for dipping, but I was left wanting more thinly sliced beef and additional ingredients.\n\nOur waitress surprised us with two free desserts: the piña colada cake and malted chocolate pie.\n\nThe cake was incredibly sweet, and we initially didn't realize it had any pineapple, but the whipped cream was, unsurprisingly, fantastic. Jordan said the chocolate pie was the only dish that tasted exactly as it looked. An Oreo crust is rarely a bad thing, but we agreed we wouldn't order it again.\n\nFor $145, we were sufficiently underwhelmed by the food. Then again, everyone else around us seemed pretty pleased, and the service is efficient without feeling rushed.\n\nAs a Wall Street go-to, Tommy Bahama presents a funny inverse. Many firms are setting up outposts in the south, namely in Texas, but the beachy restaurant is trying to bring southern, Floridian charm to 45th Street. And it is, at times, easy to forget that you're in the middle of Manhattan while sitting in the palm-filled dining room, until you look out the window, or at the guys in Charles Tyrwhitt vests sitting next to you.\n\nThe noise level and layout are conducive to a genuinely productive, laid-back business meal, and it's an easy escape from Manhattan's chaos. Provided you like the food, we see how it could become an unlikely power lunch staple.\n\nThe price is comparable to that of a steakhouse dinner, but it's nothing the corporate card can't handle, right?",

    "fullText": "In a lot of retail areas, there seem to be two clear-cut market leaders, and most people have a favorite.\n\nYou might prefer Lowe's over Home Depot, or Sam's Club over Costco.\n\nThe same logic applies to food. Some people are diehard Hostess fans, while others ride or die with Little Debbie.\n\nIn some areas, these choices can be polarizing and divisive. One person might be all in on the Big Mac, while their partner greatly prefers the Whopper.\n\nThe most polarizing battle, however, might be the choice between Coca-Cola and Pepsi.\n\nBoth companies have made public claims to be better than the other, and each one has restaurants and other partners such as theme parks, movie theaters, and arenas under exclusive deals.\n\nWhen a brand switches from Coke to Pepsi or vice versa, it's going to anger some customers, and that's exactly what Costco has done in its food court. The warehouse club has switched back to Coca-Cola products from PepsiCo brands.\n\nBecause Coke and Pepsi both have a large fan base, switching can anger some customers.\n\nI experienced a similar reaction last year aboard Carnival Celebration when the cruise line switched from Pepsi products to Coca-Cola mid-sailing. As inventory ran out, Coke fans hunted for remaining Coke products, while Pepsi drinkers searched for the last Mountain Dew and Pepsi, highlighting how emotionally charged soda loyalty can be.\n\nCostco rolled out the change toward the end of 2025 and finished swapping Pepsi products for Coca-Cola brands in the beginning of 2026.\n\nThat's not something Costco has commented on extensively, but CEO Ron Vachris addressed it during the question-and-answer session of the retailer's annual meeting.\n\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\n\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\n\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\n\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\n\n“Yes, that is accurate,” Vachris said. “This summer, we will begin converting our food court fountain business back over to Coca-Cola.”\n\nCostco had been under an exclusive deal with Pepsi since 2013.\n\n\"Costco originally made the switch to Pepsi in 2013 as a cost-saving measure, in order to keep the price of their famous hot dog and soda combo at $1.50. At the time, Pepsi was offering Walmart a better pricing deal that Costco couldn’t match. When Costco asked Coke for the same pricing, Coke refused, leading Costco to pull all Coke products from their stores for an entire month,\" Costco Insider reported.",

    "description": "Microplastics are everywhere. We drink them in our water, we eat them in our food, we breathe them in our air, leading to – so we are told – alarming levels of plastic accumulating in our tissues.",
    "fullText": "Microplastics are everywhere. We drink them in our water, we eat them in our food, we breathe them in our air, leading to – so we are told – alarming levels of plastic accumulating in our tissues.\n\nSo it was somewhat of a shock this week when the Guardian published a “bombshell” article suggesting that scientists may be overstating the health concerns. The award-winning journalist Damian Carrington, a champion of green issues, accepted that he himself had warned of the dangers, but said there was mounting concern over the technology used to detect tiny pieces of plastics in the body.\n\nThe article followed a recent letter published in Nature Medicine which questioned the analytical techniques used to detect microplastics in human tissue, warning they lacked controls and validation. One of the signatories, Dr Dusan Materic, of the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Germany, argued that fat in the body can give a false positive for polyethylene, and said the obesity epidemic could be behind the perceived rise in bodily plastic.\n\nDr Fazel Monikh, of the University of Padua, Italy, another signatory, who has spent a decade working on the detection of nanomaterials in biological samples, says he has never come across the kinds of microplastics reported in recent studies. “When particulate materials enter a living organism, including the human body, they undergo biotransformation,” he tells The Telegraph.\n\n“Even if one were to assume the highly unlikely scenario in which an intact particle reaches a protected compartment, such as the brain, and is then successfully detected, it would not retain the appearance shown in most of the reported data.\n\n“For these reasons, most of the presented results and their interpretation are not scientifically convincing to me, nor to my colleagues who are experts in this field.”\n\nMicroplastics were first detected in the human body in 2018 when Austrian scientists analysed stool samples of people in eight countries – including Britain – and found every one contained the tiny particles. Such research is not in doubt, and there is good evidence that humans do ingest tens of thousands of plastic particles each year. The sticking point is whether these become embedded in tissues, causing long-term harm.\n\nThe problem seems to lie in the tinier versions of microplastics, known as nanoplastics.\n\nOfficially, microplastics are no larger than 5mm in size (the size of a grain of rice or smaller) whereas nanoplastics are 1nm to 1,000nm in size (as small as bacteria) and are a lot harder to detect. In recent years, studies have claimed to have found these miniscule particles in nearly every human organ and tissue, including the lungs, liver, kidneys, heart, brain, placenta, testicles, bone marrow and blood.\n\nIt is feared that these tiny intruders carry toxic chemicals which cause inflammation and cell damage, as well as disrupting hormones, damaging microbes in the gut, lowering IQ, decreasing fertility and increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, heart attacks and strokes. The paper which sparked the recent Nature Medicine rebuttal letter claimed to have found microplastics and nanoplastics in the brain, which the scientists behind it linked to dementia.\n\nSuch studies have sparked a wave of eco-anxiety, with people switching to plastic-free tea bags and ditching water bottles, kitchen sponges, polyethylene chopping boards and non-stick saucepans.\n\nBut there are concerns that because microplastics are so prevalent in the environment it is difficult to tease out whether they really are getting into human tissue, or if samples are just contaminated during the process of collecting and analysing them. Lab testing should include “blanks” – control samples of clean water or inert material processed like real samples to detect contamination – but many studies do not.\n\nFay Couceiro, professor of environmental pollution at the University of Portsmouth says: “I don’t think that there is any doubt that there are microplastics in us – they are everywhere and we are breathing and eating them daily, so that they are in us is inevitable.\n\n“I think the question raised is more about where in the body they are stored and what quantity there is.\n\n“Some studies – particularly those based on humans – don’t follow the full standard methodologies used in environmental sampling around blanks, replicates and recovery checks.”\n\nWith large microplastics, scientists can easily spot particles under a microscope and then fire a laser at them to see if they are plastic. But with nanoplastics, scientists must burn the particle and measure the gases emitted, which is less reliable and still in its infancy as a technique.\n\nThis unreliability of testing has made researchers more sceptical about the more alarmist findings. An abstract presented at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology last year showing microplastics in human reproductive fluids was met with raised eyebrows among scientists.\n\n“Many previous scary-sounding headlines on microplastics in blood and food have turned out to be measurement errors,” warns Oliver Jones, professor of chemistry at RMIT University, Melbourne, referring to reports that preceded last year’s findings.\n\nLikewise, separate claims that microplastics had been found in human blood in 2022 were criticised by a US chemist as being “consistent with incidental or accidental contaminations”, in a letter to the Environmental International journal.\n\nEven Dr Philipp Schwabl, of the Medical University of Vienna, who found the original evidence of microplastics in human bodies is unsure about their health impacts. “The question of how harmful these little foreign plastic bodies truly are remains open to me and thus constitutes a crucial field of environmental biology that remains to be scientifically elucidated,” he says.\n\nYet despite the testing issues, many experts are still convinced microplastics are causing harm.\n\nProf Philip Landrigan, a paediatrician and epidemiologist at Boston College in the US, led a recent review into microplastics for the Lancet, and says people should not dismiss the dangers. “The Guardian article is accurate in pointing out that there is work to be done in refining, standardising and harmonising the analytical techniques for examining microplastics in tissue samples,” he says.\n\n“There is a need especially to distinguish microplastics from lipids [fats]. But the Guardian is wrong in implying that this whole area of science is rubbish.\n\n“The presence of microplastics in the human body needs to be taken seriously, even if we don’t yet know all the ways in which they may harm health. They cannot be wished away.”\n\nThe Medical University of Vienna recently developed a new imaging technique which can detect plastics without needing to burn up samples. They say it reduces contamination risk and allows scientists to find direct correlations between tissue samples and disease.\n\nAnd Dr Matthew Campen, of the University of New Mexico, lead author of the brain study that was challenged in Nature Medicine, said his team had hosted a microplastics conference in the last few days in which “convincing” new evidence had been presented of particles in cerebrospinal fluid. “Our paper is actually very clear on where uncertainties lie and how these may impact the interpretation of results,” he added. “We are 100 per cent confident that nanoplastics are in the brain.”\n\nProf Lukas Kenner, deputy director of the Department of Pathology at the Medical University of Vienna, says: “The concerns raised are understandable but a blanket dismissal of the entire body of evidence is not scientifically justified.\n\n“While early studies certainly had methodological limitations, the field has advanced rapidly.\n\n“There is now good evidence that microplastics can enter and accumulate in the human body, and growing experimental evidence that they are biologically active rather than inert.”\n\nFor now, it seems the scientific community is split on the true impact of microplastics and it may be several years before consensus is reached on the harms. The debate over the extent to which they enter and remain in human bodies will be a key part of those discussions.\n\nWhile some fear that plastics could be the modern-day equivalent of asbestos, lead or tobacco, it may be that the particles are processed or ejected by the body before they do long-term damage.\n\nProf Christian Dunn, an expert in microplastic pollution at Bangor University in Wales, says: “When it comes to nanoplastics I think we’re still pushing the boundaries as to what we can confidently detect.\n\n“The extent of how much of this plastic is entering and accumulating in our organs, and the damage this is doing to us, is still up for scientific discovery.”\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "Chris Kempczinski said fiber, sweet and spicy flavor combinations, and innovative drinks will reign supreme this year.",
    "fullText": "McDonald's CEO predicts three food trends will reign supreme in 2026.\n\nChris Kempczinski, the fast-food chain's top boss, took to Instagram on Monday to tell his followers what diners will crave this year.\n\nBut before spilling the secrets, he said he wanted to \"do a little bit of a victory lap\" because all his 2025 predictions came true. His big bets for 2025 were protein, AI in fast food, and sauces, all of which had their moments last year.\n\nHere's what's on his 2026 list.\n\nThe first item on Kempczinski's 2026 list was fiber, which he said is \"going to be big.\"\n\nThis is not a surprise, as the dietary trend \"fibermaxxing\" has had its fair share of airtime over the past year. Dieticians say that consuming more fiber helps aid gut health, lower cholesterol, and reduce the risk of colon cancer.\n\nPepsiCo's CEO Ramon Laguarta did beat Kempczinski to the punch, predicting in an October earnings call that \"fiber will be the next protein.\"\n\nThe second item on his list was a unique flavor combination: \"Sweet and spicy together is going to be a big food trend.\"\n\nFast food chains have already jumped on the trend. In 2025, chains like Chipotle, KFC, and Taco Bell all rolled out hot honey dipping sauces.\n\nThis trend is a continuation of his \"sauces\" prediction from last year. In 2025, Kempczinski said sauces, rather than the main dish, would be diners' focus.\n\n\"Spicy is always in,\" he said then. \"I think you might see some honey or some sweet stuff.\"\n\nMcDonald's does have a sweet-spicy sauce offering in its Creamy Chili McCrispy Strip Dip.\n\nAnd lastly, Kempczinski said, \"You're going to see a lot of beverage innovation.\"\n\nOver the past year, fast food chains have rolled out new beverages, with some, such as Taco Bell and Chick-fil-A, launching new beverage-focused spin-offs. Taco Bell opened its Live Más Café chain, and Chick-fil-A opened its Daybright chain, both selling coffees and fruity refreshers.\n\nOne reason for Kempczinski's prediction of drink innovation could be that Gen Z consumers are not huge fans of alcohol, but rather are on the hunt for exciting and unusual drink combinations.",

    "description": "Brooke Rollins suggested eating ‘a piece of chicken, a piece of broccoli, corn tortilla and one other thing’ as Americans struggle to put food on the table",
    "fullText": "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has been mocked online over a “depression meal” she suggested for Americans after the Trump administration turned the food pyramid upside down.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture recently released new dietary guidelines, suggesting Americans eat more protein, dairy and healthy fats and less whole grains. Rollins and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who previously said he was on a so-called carnivore diet, told Americans when rolling out the guidelines to “eat real food.”\n\nIn a TV appearance on Wednesday, Rollins suggested an affordable, albeit lackluster, meal Americans can make that sticks to the new guidelines.\n\n“We've run over 1,000 simulations. It can cost around $3 a meal for a piece of chicken, a piece of broccoli, corn tortilla and one other thing. And so, there is a way to do this that actually will save the average American consumer money,” Rollins told News Nation.\n\nA clip of Rollins' comments was shared online, and social media users were quick to poke fun at the out-of-touch dining suggestion.\n\n“Private jets and tax breaks for them and their rich friends, and one piece of broccoli *AND* a tortilla for you!” Chasten Glezman Buttigieg, the husband of former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, wrote on X.\n\nMarlow Stern, who teaches at the Columbia Journalism School, posted, “‘You should eat prison meals’ prob not the best message.”\n\n“One whole tortilla?!” Democratic strategist Jennifer Holdsworth sarcastically said.\n\nFred Wellman, podcast host and Democratic Congressional candidate, wrote, “They hate so much of America. They just hate them.”\n\n“Are they doing Monte Carlo simulations to create the most affordable r/depressionmeal,” Tyson Brody, who identifies as an opposition researcher, posted.\n\nWhile inflation held steady in December at 2.7 percent, grocery prices remained high, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index. Uncooked ground beef was up 15.5 percent, and frozen fish and seafood increased 8.6 percent year-on-year.\n\nHealth experts Lauren Ball and Emily Burch weighed in on the new dietary guidelines’ lack of attention to socio-economic issues when it comes to food.\n\n“Access to affordable, healthy food remains limited across the US, especially for people in low-income communities, rural areas, or those working long and unpredictable hours,” the two wrote for The Independent. “People choose food based on whether it’s affordable, accessible and culturally relevant – but the guidelines overlooked these structural drivers.”",

    "fullText": "Sometimes a subtle change makes all the difference.\n\nLast year, for example, my local coffee place, 1971, was sold and taken over by a new owner who also owned the Greek restaurant nearby. He kept the coffee the same, but swapped out most of the pastry and food offerings for a larger emphasis on Greek offerings.\n\nAlthough the menu changes were subtle, the shop seemed less busy, and seating was more available. Within six months, the location closed and was replaced by a nail salon.\n\nChange comes with risk, and similar brands are not always equitable. If your McDonald's closed and was replaced by a Wendy's, some people would be happy, while others would be indifferent, and some would be upset.\n\nThat's the risk Dutch Bros Coffee is taking with its latest purchase.\n\nClutch Coffee, a drive-thru coffee chain founded in 2018, shared its big news on Facebook.\n\n\"Exciting changes ahead! We’re switching gears. We have reached an agreement with Dutch Bros, and Clutch’s last day of business will be this Friday 1/16, closing @ 4 p.m. You can keep the good energy going with Dutch Bros and download the Dutch Bros app,\" the chain shared.\n\nAll 20 Clutch Coffee locations will close on Jan. 16, then reopen at a later date as Dutch Bros. locations.\n\n\"The plan will be for restaurants to close, renovate, and then reopen as Dutch Bros. Notably, Dutch Bros has just two Carolina locations presently — one in Morrisville, North Carolina, and a unit in Summerville, South Carolina,\" QSR Magazine reported.\n\nTaco Bell and KFC work on simplifying their restaurants\n\nChick-fil-A making major change to 425 restaurants nationwide\n\nBankrupt beer and pizza restaurant chain closes locations\n\nRestaurant chain famed for rude waiters closes multiple locations\n\nDutch Bros. confirmed the purchase to QSR.\n\nAs a fellow brand built on human connection, we deeply respect what the Clutch Coffee Bar leadership team has built and look forward to building on that strong foundation in the Carolinas,” the company said in a statement.\n\n“We’re excited to continue expanding across the country as we work toward our long-term goal of 2,029 shops in 2029.”\n\nDropping the Clutch Coffee brand and replacing it with Dutch Bros comes with some risk.\n\n“If you can flip that switch in a customer’s head and become the brand that they define their choice of coffee around, their loyalty can be incredibly powerful,” Dale Harris, 2017 World Barista Champion with 13 years of experience with Hasbean and Ozone Coffee, told Coffee Intelligence.",

    "fullText": "Musk attempts to recast AI tool’s misuse. Plus, tech billionaires plot against a proposed California tax on their fortunes\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, US tech editor for the Guardian. Today, we discuss Elon Musk’s rosy depiction of Grok’s image generation controversy; the seven-figure panic among Silicon Valley billionaires over a proposed wealth tax in California, though with one notable exception; and how AI and robotics have revitalized the Consumer Electronics Showcase.\n\nThe firestorm over the Grok AI tool has been raging for more than a week now, and it shows no signs of dying down.\n\nLast week, I wrote about the rising backlash against Elon Musk’s Grok AI tool, which in recent weeks has allowed users to generate thousands of sexualized images of women. Some of the images show real women, some are fake, some are nonconsensual, and some depict children, all in “minimal clothing”, as the AI tool itself described them.\n\nX and its parent company, xAI, have taken some measures to curb the flood. The social network shut off its image generation feature for users who do not pay, which constitute the majority of X’s users.\n\nThroughout the controversy, Musk has obstinately recast the AI tool’s problems as everything but what they really are. He’s been promoting its popularity as if it were a piece of productivity software. He crows about its download numbers with dubious claims. On 10 January; he celebrated Grok reaching the top spot in New Zealand’s version of Apple’s App Store. (Rankings by the analytics firm SimilarWeb of the most-downloaded apps in New Zealand, which were updated the same day as Musk’s tweet, put Grok in 14th place.) The same day, he reposted a tweet about Grok reaching the No 1 spot in Thailand’s Apple App Store. (SimilarWeb’s rankings do not show Grok in the top 50 most-downloaded apps in the country.) On 9 January, he retweeted a post about Google searches for Grok spiking. (I would guess the increase in searches is evidence of great interest in the AI tool’s scandal more so than interest in using it.)\n\nIn response to the UK’s threats to ban the AI tool, he accused the country’s government of stifling free speech. After watchdogs cited instances of Grok undressing minors, he said: “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” handing the responsibility to moderate his social network to law enforcement and courts. “Illegal” is in a court’s hands and frees him from moderating all but the most heinous content.\n\nPerhaps to Musk, all press is good press? He may be right: his AI tool seems likely to accrue more users and few penalties as a result of the flood of nearly naked images.\n\nGrok has faced some repercussions: the UK’s communications regulator, Ofcom, has launched an investigation into xAI and Grok, and possible punishments could include a total ban. The Internet Watch Foundation, also based in the UK, announced it had found instances of child sexual abuse material generated by Grok in Dark Web forums. X’s revenue in the UK has plummeted by 60% as concerns over content moderation and brand safety grow. Both Indonesia and Malaysia have limited access to the AI tool in response.\n\nBut missing from the chorus decrying Grok are the two de facto smartphone regulators of smartphone software, Apple and Google, operators of the world’s biggest mobile app stores. Neither has indicated whether the Grok’s output violates their app stores’ terms of service. In the US, there’s been little backlash from regulators and lawmakers.\n\nThe lesson for Musk and other tech leaders seems apparent: the fewer restrictions you place on AI, the more shocking content you allow it to generate, the greater your engagement and your profit.\n\nTech’s billionaires are plotting against a proposed tax on their fortunes that may appear on ballots across California in November.\n\nVenture capitalist and antichrist evangelist Peter Thiel has already made a $3m donation to fight the proposal, according to campaign finance disclosures filed with the state. Other billionaires have started an encrypted group chat on Signal to strategize against it, which includes Anduril founder Palmer Luckey, Trump’s AI and crypto “czar” David Sacks, according to the Wall Street Journal. It’s called “Save California”. My colleague Dara Kerr reports on the division among billionaires:\n\nUnder a tax proposal that could be put to voters this November, any California resident worth more than $1bn would have to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state.\n\nSeveral Silicon Valley figures have already threatened to leave California and take their business elsewhere. But Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, whose net worth is nearly $159bn, told Bloomberg Television this week that he is “perfectly fine with it”.\n\nThis puts Huang in stark contrast with the Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, the venture capitalist David Sacks, all of whom have recently indicated they are leaving California for tax-friendlier states including Florida and Texas.\n\nUnder the proposed tax, Huang would pay roughly $7bn, and Page and Brin would pay one-time amounts of about $13bn and $12bn, respectively, based on their current net worth of $264bn and $243bn. Thiel would pay $1.3bn, based on his current net worth of $26bn.\n\nThe Consumer Electronics Show, held annually in Las Vegas for decades since its start in 1967, made global news this year. Nvidia and AMD chose it as the forum for major announcements on new hardware and software. Samsung announced a double folding phone, the Galaxy Z Fold 3, and Lego debuted a “smart brick” that seems quite fun as well. Robots abounded, rechristened as “physical AI”.\n\nIt’s been quite the turnaround for CES. For much of the 2010s, hardware announcements rarely made for top headlines. New DVD players or TVs did not make a splash. Smartphones dominated, and they all looked extremely similar. Apple, the most valuable company in the world at the end of the decade, even skipped it entirely. Now, however, Nvidia is the most valuable company in the world, and it chose CES to present what’s next. Artificial intelligence and robotics have breathed new life into CES. The themes and innovations that define the convention are broader and affect more industries outside tech than they once did.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I predicted that consumer technology would take many strange new shapes in the coming year, which seems to already be true as we view new developments in robotics. Humanoid robots debuted at CES, including one from Hyundai and Boston Dynamics. My colleague Samuel Gibbs dubbed a laundry-folding robot one of the best things about the convention.\n\nMeta blocked nearly 550,000 accounts in first days of Australia’s under-16s social media ban\n\nIran’s internet shutdown is chillingly precise and may last some time\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet hits $4tn valuation after AI deal with Apple\n\n‘Dangerous and alarming’: Google removes some of its AI summaries after users’ health put at risk",

    "fullText": "The plan was to get on a bicycle to earn some money. It wasn’t to get hit by cars, thumped by skinheads or to see my surroundings in a whole new light\n\nGet our weekend culture and lifestyle email\n\nAt first I didn’t realise I’d been punched. I’m not sure why my brain assumed a bird had flown into me, but I suppose a magpie attack was more likely than a random bloke lashing out at my ribcage, so it took a second to realise what was happening.\n\nI was on my bike, waiting in a sidestreet for traffic to clear. The punch came from behind and by the time my mouth let fly a few expletives, the culprit was leaving. Then he caught wind of my colourful language and turned back to get in my face. He was a skinhead in a bad mood. Accusing me of being in his way, he told me I was lucky he didn’t do more damage. I paused mid-reply. This was the moment I realised he was ready to go to hell tonight, and the only thing he wanted to take with him was me.\n\nWhen you deliver for companies like Uber Eats, no two shifts are the same. I’d say 80% of my deliveries are fast food – a combination of McDonald’s, KFC, Hungry Jacks and coffee. Lots of coffee. My new workplace couldn’t be more different than the grey blur of an office, surrounded by the same walls and same people week after week. The culture shock of going from comfy chairs and morning teas to trying not to get killed in traffic was significant.\n\nAfter being made redundant four times in six years, months passed with hundreds of unsuccessful job applications. Bills needed to be paid. The big ones were still looming, but the small costs could be covered by delivering for Uber Eats. My Xbox was gathering dust so I sold it at Cash Converters and put the money towards a half-decent mountain bike.\n\nThe first thing that hits you riding is the feeling of independence. In between delivering Grey Goose vodka and KFC Zinger burgers, there’s the realisation that it’s just you out there. After four months, I haven’t talked to anyone at Uber Eats. I signed up on my phone, they sent me a fluoro thermal bag, and off I went. I don’t have to worry about anybody making me redundant because there is no anybody – there’s just me. If I want to spend hours in the park eating lunch, I will. Need more sleep? That’s between me and my doona. Granted, my wages are much lower, but what value can be placed on listening to Wu-Tang Clan with wind in my hair versus dreading another company restructure?\n\nJust to be clear, my hair is secure underneath a helmet. Which was good for when I collided with a car and ended up with a face full of road. There are lots of bike paths in Melbourne, but far too many of them are squeezed in between moving traffic and parked traffic. They’re less than a metre wide and often occupied by wavering cars, massive trucks or in this case, part of a parked Ford Fiesta. Before I could react, a driver had opened their door into the bike lane without looking. I couldn’t do anything except stop my bike dead while my body crashed into the bitumen.\n\nThings like this happen too often. I tore up my knee when my front wheel got caught in a tram track (a uniquely Melbourne problem) and my cheek laid against the road as I watched one of my earpods get crushed underneath a truck. A ute with aftermarket exhausts forced me into a gutter and my shins still haven’t recovered. It didn’t take long before I realised I could never relax on this job. My attention needs to be on 10 different things from one second to the next. My muscles are always tense, my brain always on alert. After a shift, it’s not unusual for my mind and body to immediately crash.\n\nI always knew urban planning was designed around cars but now I feel it in my bones. Not only is the amount of space dedicated to cars immense, society focuses on cars first. Shopfronts and advertisements face the road, hundreds of car parks take up thousands of metres and I avoid countless potholes in bike lanes while the cars right next to me drive on pristine asphalt.\n\nThere’s also a stark difference between people in cars and people I deliver to. When I hand over my orders, most are friendly. They’re dealing with hangovers or excited to get their comfort food. I once said “Pizza time!” to some young kids and they cheered. On the other hand, if there’s a form of life that’s lower than cyclists in the eyes of cars, it’s Uber Eats bikes.\n\nSome customers I’ve delivered to have been downright apologetic. I suppose they feel guilty for getting their Maccas order delivered when they live around the corner. No judgment from me; I still get my bonus for doing nine deliveries by 2pm. Uber Eats regularly gamifies their rewards for drivers: from week to week, they offer financial bonuses for set time periods. Let’s say you wake up on Monday and the app promotes an offer to do 30 orders before Thursday. Complete this task, and you’ll get $72 extra. It’s nice but unreliable. They’re random events based on demand and location. It can be a big bonus or a big nothing. Then it simply becomes how much effort you’re willing to put in. Another factor of being independent.\n\nUltimately, this job isn’t a long-term solution. It’s a Band-Aid on a broken leg. The jury is still out on whether it’s better than being stuck at a desk. Air-conditioning versus sizzling heat. Freedom of movement versus monitored hours. Meetings that could have been an email versus an outdoor activity that is improving my fitness but has a very real chance of causing my untimely death. The money’s not as good but I meet nice people, get to know my city and choose my own hours.",

    "fullText": "Matthew Landry, a dietitian, studies how our diets can prevent heart attacks later in life.\n\nLandry recommends making simple food swaps to control cholesterol levels.\n\nOpt for olive oil over butter and chicken over red meat, he said.\n\nA nutrition researcher and dietitian who studies how simple habits can protect our hearts shared three simple food swaps.\n\nCardiovascular disease is the No. 1 cause of death in the US, but research has found that eating a Mediterranean-style diet and being physically active can help lower the risk. The American Heart Association's dietary guidelines recommend prioritizing fresh produce, whole grains, lean proteins such as fish, and limiting ultra-processed foods and refined sugar.\n\nThat may sound like a lot, but Matthew Landry told Business Insider that you don't necessarily need to overhaul your diet to improve your heart health.\n\nLandy, an assistant professor at the University of California, Irvine, suggested considering: \"how can we make simple swaps with our diet? How can we engage in more physical activity, and do very simple things that all add up to help prevent a heart attack later?\"\n\nHere are his three suggestions:\n\nLandry's first swap relates to the type of fat used for cooking. He suggests switching butter or lard for heart-healthy fats like olive oil or avocado oil.\n\n\"We're not necessarily changing the food, we're just changing how we're sometimes preparing it,\" he said.\n\nAnimal products and full-fat dairy products like beef tallow, butter, and cream contain saturated fat, which can drive up our LDL or \"bad cholesterol levels, Landry said. If a person has too much LDL cholesterol in their blood, it can form a sticky plaque in their arteries, putting them at greater risk of heart disease.\n\nWe need fat as part of a balanced diet, but unsaturated fats, found in foods such as avocados, fatty fish, nuts, and olive oil, don't raise our LDL cholesterol nearly as much as saturated fat, he said.\n\nThere's one finding that keeps cropping up in Landry's research: reducing red meat consumption lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nLandry worked on a 2023 study in which 22 pairs of identical twins were assigned either a vegan or an omnivorous diet for eight weeks. It was the focus of a Netflix documentary titled \"You Are What You Eat: A Twin Experiment.\"\n\nThis doesn't mean you have to cut out meat entirely, Landry said, but he recommended swapping red and processed meats, including beef, pork, and sausages, for leaner options like poultry, such as chicken and turkey, or fish, which are lower in saturated fat.\n\nIt's also a good idea to add plant-based protein sources to your diet. \"Eventually, I would love for folks to even move further than that and start consuming some plant-based proteins, some beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh. Those are great things for our heart as well,\" he said.\n\nFiber is great at keeping cholesterol levels \"nice and stable,\" Landry said, but most Americans don't eat enough. Ninety percent of women, and 97% of men, don't meet the recommended 30 grams of fiber a day, according to the 2020 to 2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The 2025 to 2030 guidelines recommend two to four servings of whole grains a day.\n\nWhole grains such as brown rice, quinoa, and whole-wheat bread are good sources of fiber and can easily replace their white counterparts, which tend to be low in fiber. One cup of brown rice, for example, contains 3.5 grams of fiber, while a cup of white rice contains 0.6 grams.\n\n\"We can still have bread, we can still have rice,\" Landry, said, \"but the whole grain version.\"",

    "description": "After visiting 29 states last year, I fell in love with Maine. The state's food, friendly people, and gorgeous scenery all made me feel at home.",
    "fullText": "Last year, my husband and I drove across the country, spending quality time in 29 states. Although we visited so many great destinations, if I had to pick one to move to, it would definitely be Maine.\n\nWith picturesque beach towns, lighthouses dotting the coastline, and lobster boats puttering through the harbors, Maine lived up to all my expectations of the ideal New England destination.\n\nPlus, its wooded natural preserves, delicious food, and kind people truly won me over.\n\nIf there's one thing that's synonymous with Maine, it's lighthouses. And for good reason: the state has 65 of them positioned along the coast, islands, and inlets.\n\nDuring our one-month stay in Portland, we visited six, including the West Quoddy Head Light — located on the US's easternmost peninsula — and the iconic Portland Head Light.\n\nPlus, some of the most scenic lighthouses are in the stunning Acadia National Park. While visiting, we stopped by Bass Harbor Head Light Station and hiked down to the rocks below the tower. Looking up at the beacon offered a unique vantage point I didn't experience anywhere else.\n\nAlthough the coast may get a lot of attention, Maine's inland sections offer just as many opportunities to spend time outside and explore quirky towns.\n\nFor hiking, there are countless trails and nature reserves to roam, my favorite of which was the Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens.\n\nAlthough the tree-covered trails were beautiful, our main mission was to find the massive trolls made out of recycled wood. These gentle giants made the trip to the gardens even more memorable.\n\nWe also took a trip up to Bangor, Maine, which is known for its most famous former resident: Stephen King.\n\nWe walked by his house (which is as spooky as you'd expect) and checked out the imposing water tower that is often said to be the inspiration for his novel \"It.\"\n\nIf there's one food you have to try in Maine, it's lobster — specifically, the lobster roll.\n\nFor the sake of comparison, I tried both varieties that are popular in Maine: the cold Maine-style roll (which mixes chilled lobster with mayo and celery) and the warm Connecticut-style, which tosses lobster meat in warm butter. Although the cold roll may be the more traditional style, the butter won me over.\n\nSeafood was popular across the board in Maine, but I found that my other favorite dishes were desserts. For example, the whoopie pies had the perfect level of springy sponge and decadent cream, and the potato doughnuts offered a heartier, less sweet take on the classic treat.\n\nWe also happened to be visiting during blueberry season, which runs from late July to early September. We enjoyed blueberry tarts, scones with blueberry jam, and even blueberry-infused beer served with a generous handful of the berries floating in the glass.\n\nHowever, these weren't made with the blueberries I was used to buying at the grocery store. Instead, these Maine delicacies were crafted with wild blueberries, which are about half the size and much sweeter than the \"typical\" blueberry I usually enjoy.\n\nWhether at a lobster shack along a rural highway or in one of the state's many breweries, the people we met were quite friendly and quick to strike up a conversation.\n\nLocals seemed to genuinely love living in Maine (as opposed to some states we stayed in, where residents would ask, \"Why did you choose to visit here?\")\n\nThe most palpable community spirit I experienced was at a Portland Hearts of Pine soccer game. Here, we saw folks running into neighbors and chatting with seatmates.\n\nThe energy in the crowd was contagious, and we quickly found ourselves singing along to the team chant.\n\nFrom the food to the beaches, I fell in love with everything that Maine had to offer. At the same time, I recognize that spending July in the Pine Tree State is very different from visiting in January.\n\nWould I still love Maine as much when there's snow on the ground and a frigid breeze blowing in from the Atlantic? Based on everything I experienced, I believe so.\n\nI guess I'll just have to plan another trip to find out.",

    "fullText": "Oprah Winfrey, 71, says growing older has made her more appreciative of her health, especially after using GLP-1s to manage obesity.\n\nIn an interview with CBS Sunday Morning, Winfrey spoke about how learning that obesity is a disease helped her stop seeing her weight as a personal failure.\n\n\"I'm not going to, but I could weep right now for all of the many days and nights I've journaled about this being my fault and why can't I conquer this thing?\" Winfrey told host Jane Pauley.\n\nWinfrey said the \"food noise\" in her head went away within hours on the first day she took a GLP-1 medication.\n\n\"There are tools to use that can help you. And I do see it as a tool,\" she said.\n\n\"I have become indifferent to food. I still love it. I still love it. But I'm not in any way obsessed about it,\" she said.\n\nWinfrey added that she's come to see the medication as something she needs to continue taking to manage obesity. If anything, she wishes she had known about it earlier.\n\n\"I have regret that I didn't discover it in 2013. I have regret that, oh my gosh, this has been going on for over 12 years now, and I didn't know about it,\" she said.\n\n\"I think about the wasted time. The wasted time, the wasted sadness and shame about it. I think about the wasted years,\" Winfrey said.\n\nStill, Winfrey said she has a new appreciation for her health and how she feels in her body today.\n\n\"I am just happy. This is what I feel. I feel that when I was 40 and ran a marathon, I certainly could appreciate the strength that it took to do that and the work that it took to get into that shape,\" she said. \"But there's something about being 71 that gives you a perspective and the long view of appreciation that's unlike any other time in your life.\"\n\nWinfrey added that while she felt good at 40, being strong and healthy at 71 has been much more meaningful.\n\n\"Because what it takes to be in the best shape of your life when you're 71 is a whole lot more than when you're 40,\" she added.\n\nHer lifelong struggles with weight have led her to recognize the value of having treatment options today.\n\n\"I have a sense of gratitude that I was able to live in a time where these medications were made available to people to change their lives,\" she said.\n\nWinfrey first revealed that she was using a type of GLP-1 medication in December 2023, but didn't disclose which one.\n\nIn December 2025, Winfrey told People that she went off the medication for a year because she wanted to prove that she could \"do without it,\" but ended up gaining 20 pounds.\n\n\"It's going to be a lifetime thing. I'm on high blood pressure medication, and if I go off the high blood pressure medication, my blood pressure is going to go up. The same thing is true now, I realize, with these medications. I've proven to myself I need it,\" Winfrey said.\n\nGLP-1 drugs, such as semaglutide, work by regulating hunger signals, allowing people to feel full while consuming less. However, these drugs can cause gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea and diarrhoea. Research has also shown that it is not uncommon for patients to regain the weight after stopping treatment.",

    "fullText": "Have you gotten enough protein today?\n\nThis question may have crossed your mind recently, as more and more Americans are becoming obsessed with their intake of the macronutrient.\n\nMust Read: Trump's 2026 Alcohol Tariffs Are Coming — Here's What'll Hurt The Most\n\nThe craze has ushered in a slew of new protein-packed products — from bars and powders to popcorns and pancake mixes — and has sent many of us scrambling to the meat department at our grocery store to get our fix.\n\nIn fact, one recent study found “U.S. meat consumption grew from 109 kg to 117 kg per capita between 2018 and 2023 and is projected to grow to 122 kg per capita in 2027.”\n\nBut should we be thinking twice about where our protein comes from and what dangers might be lurking if we jump mouth-first into a diet full of meat?\n\nThat’s what we — Raj Punjabi-Johnson and Noah Michelson, the hosts of HuffPost’s “Am I Doing It Wrong?” podcast — asked Elizabeth Dunn, a food journalist who’s written widely about nutrition, when she recently dropped by our studio.\n\nPress play to hear the full episode:\n\n“There definitely is this kind of perception online that if you’re going to live a high-protein life, that involves a lot of meat,” Dunn told us. “What you don’t hear talked about a lot in those contexts is the downsides to eating a lot of meat. The data is very, very clear — I mean, like decades of large-scale, reputable studies that show that the higher in meat your diet is, the higher your chances are of getting cancer, of getting diabetes, of all-cause mortality — meaning just basically dying younger. So there really are pretty big health consequences to eating a very meat-heavy diet, especially a very red meat-heavy or processed meat-heavy diet.”\n\nThere’s one popular protein-forward snack that especially concerns Dunn.\n\nMust Read: THIS Is The Color Bell Pepper To Eat If You Want Maximum Immune Support\n\n“One of the fastest growing snack categories right now is meat sticks,” she said. “Obviously, the protein trend is driving that, [and though] they also are very delicious, what really surprises me, especially because we’re in this very healthy, nutritious, conscious moment right now, is that people aren’t aware of the fact that processed meats are class one carcinogens — Group 1 carcinogens. So that’s a World Health Organization classification, and it means that we know that they cause cancer in humans. So this is really something that I think more people should think about.”\n\nDunn noted that the average American doesn’t need to supplement their diet with extra protein because they’re probably already getting the recommended daily allowance in their meals. However, if we are looking for more protein, she urged us to get it from whole foods, rather than processed ones.\n\nShe added that there’s protein in most foods, which means even people who don’t eat meat shouldn’t need to work too hard to get their daily needs met.\n\n“As long as you’re making a concerted effort as a vegetarian to eat a lot of different plants, like, you’re gonna get as much protein as you need,” she said.\n\nMust Read: Health Experts Have A Warning About Your Protein-Packed Waffles, Cookies And Snacks\n\nMichelson noted that “a cup of [cooked] spinach ... has five grams of protein in it, a cup of raw peas has eight grams of protein ... wild rice has six grams of protein in a cup.”\n\nWhole grains are also a “huge source of protein,” Dunn said.\n\n“I’m not just talking about quinoa — oats have a lot of protein in them, things like seeds, like hemp seeds and chia seeds, have a lot of protein ... It adds up a lot faster than you think.”\n\nSo if you’ve been anxious about not getting enough protein, worry not! You probably are, but if you want an extra boost, reach for whole foods — and maybe skip processed meats as a regular part of your diet.\n\nMust Read: 6 Foods That Surprisingly ‘Count’ As Vegetables, According To Nutrition Experts\n\nWe also chatted with Dunn about why we’re wasting our time and money if we’re getting too much protein, which nutrient we should probably be focusing on instead of protein, and much more.\n\nListen to the full episode above or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nMake sure to ” on whatever podcast platform you prefer so you don’t miss a single episode from our brand-new third season.

    "description": "Fast food chains are expanding their retail offerings and seeking viral glory with collectable items, like cups, keychains, apparel, and tote bags.",
    "fullText": "Limited-edition cups, tote bags, and cartoonish keychains are the latest weapon in the restaurant industry's battle for consumer attention.\n\nAs restaurant margins remain tight and consumers become more price-sensitive, chains are expanding their retail offerings and increasingly turning to collectible merchandise as a way to signal increased value without resorting to discounting.\n\nThe strategy, experts say, taps into consumers' fear of missing out as well as their sense of identity — especially for younger generations, who see brands as social signals — while driving repeat visits, loyalty sign-ups, and viral buzz. The result is a low-cost, high-impact approach that helps restaurants stay culturally relevant and top of mind even as dining habits shift.\n\nStarbucks' Bearista cups are a recent and widely visible example. Released in limited quantities around the holidays, the cups sparked lines, sellouts, and sky-high resale listings — and, crucially, social-media chatter that had little to do with coffee itself. Ernie Ross, founder of the branding agency Ross Advertising, said the frenzy wasn't accidental.\n\n\"That scarcity of supply, that limited idea that this is only for an exclusive group of a few people, increases the value and worth of any item,\" Ross said. \"Some of the stores received less than 10 of the cups, yet they were promoting that you should come to Starbucks for this.\"\n\nRoss said scarcity reliably shifts consumer behavior, creating urgency and predictable \"queueing\" instincts that brands can harness in moments of pressure.\n\n\"If you tell us that something is scarce in supply, we desire it more,\" he said. It's just human nature, he added — if you see a group lining up for an item, you're going to want to jump in line, too.\n\nThe strategy is accelerating at a fraught moment for restaurants — especially in the middle of the market. Deloitte principal Evert Gruyaert said that restaurants, operating in a value-driven environment, are seeking ways to hold their core consumers' attention.\n\n\"The consumer today is increasingly looking for more value for the price,\" Gruyaert said. \"Now in the US, about 40% of consumers are really what we would call value-seekers.\"\n\nWhile many chains are also bolstering their value menus and slashing combo meal prices, continued discounting is not a viable long-term plan.\n\n\"Heavily discounting your menu is just not sustainable,\" Gruyaert said, noting that restaurants operate on \"very, very thin margins.\"\n\nCollectible merch, he said, offers a workaround.\n\n\"We call these full-margin promotions,\" Gruyaert said. \"You can still charge the full price of your meal, get your full margin on that, but you just get something extra.\"\n\nDunkin's recent mini tote bag promotion followed a similar logic. The chain offered branded totes to loyalty members who purchased a drink, encouraging repeat visits while tying the reward to app usage and data collection. Chick-fil-A has also leaned into collectibles with the launch of branded reusable cups, offering customers a chance at free meals for a year if they snag one of their rare gold designs.\n\n\"Most of this is all to drive additional traffic,\" Gruyaert said. \"It's also driving more frequency — collect them all, and you have a limited amount of time to do that.\"\n\nBeyond traffic, Gruyaert said merchandise is increasingly used to strengthen loyalty ecosystems, adding that exclusive items can replace free food as milestone rewards.\n\nJack in the Box's \"Jibbi\" keychains show how chains are also tapping into internet culture. The vinyl figures, which echo the viral Labubu collectible aesthetic popular among Gen Z, were rolled out as limited-edition items designed to spark social sharing. For branding experts, that cultural resonance is the point.\n\n\"For Gen Z, brands are actually a form of identity and social expression,\" Gruyaert said. \"A restaurant is not just competing on food itself anymore, but also on brand identity.\"\n\nNational Restaurant Association Chief Economist Chad Moutray said consumer demand is already there. He pointed to a recent NRA survey data showing that nearly half of adults are open to buying restaurant-branded apparel.\n\n\"Forty-four percent of adults say they're likely to purchase apparel such as sweatshirts and caps with a restaurant's name and logo,\" Moutray said. Among younger consumers, the numbers are even higher, with 65% of millennials and 55% of Gen Z adults reporting the same appeal.\n\nFor restaurants, Moutray said, merch serves a dual purpose: it's a way for them to extend their brands, while simultaneously operating as free marketing.\n\nThe revenue component of expanded retail offerings matters, too.\n\n\"The math is difficult for restaurants right now,\" Moutray said. \"Costs have risen pretty significantly, and there's a hesitance to pass those on to the consumer.\"\n\nThat makes non-food revenue streams more attractive, allowing chains to extend their brand while also diversifying their revenue.\n\nWhile collectibles aren't new — fast-food toys and promotional giveaways have been staples for decades — experts say the current wave is broader, more intentional, and more culturally attuned. Cross-brand collaborations, like Chipotle's line of college dorm decor with Urban Outfitters, have further amplified the effect.\n\n\"If you have two brands that are tapping into that same consumer segment, that's where the magic can happen,\" Gruyaert said. \"These things are sold out in no time, and they have the potential to go viral.\"\n\nRoss framed the moment as part of a longer shift toward emotional, rather than purely functional, branding.\n\n\"Something only has a value in the meaning attributed to it,\" he said.\n\nHe argued that collectibles work because they create what he calls \"currency of conversation,\" allowing brands to earn attention before talking about menus or pricing.\n\nAnd crucially, all three experts agreed the trend is unlikely to fade once economic conditions improve, with Moutray calling it \"one of those ongoing trends that's going to continue.\"\n\nFor restaurants navigating a squeezed middle, collectible merch has become more than a novelty. It's a way to sell belonging, buzz, and brand loyalty — one tchotchke at a time.",

    "description": "Kansas City Food Not Bombs said it has been serving a free meal at a parking lot off Independence Avenue for 13 years.",
    "fullText": "Kansas City police arrested two volunteers with Kansas City Food Not Bombs on Sunday for trespassing in a parking lot where the group has long served meals, the group said.\n\nTwo people were charged in Kansas City Municipal Court on Monday with trespassing for alleged violations at the address where the group serves meals, according to court records.\n\nThe group — a volunteer, mutual aid organization that provides free, hot, vegan meals on Sundays in a parking lot in Kansas City’s Lykins neighborhood, near the intersection of Independence Avenue and Monroe Avenue — posted a video of the Jan. 4 arrests on social media Friday. The video shows a group of Kansas City police officers placing two people in handcuffs in a parking lot and shooing other people away from the area.\n\n“I told you that you are on private property, and you’re trespassing,” one uniformed officer says as he secures handcuffs around one person’s wrists.\n\nLater in the video, a voice can be heard addressing people gathered near the arrests: “You’re trespassing. Leave. Or you’re going to be in handcuffs too. Does everybody understand? This is your warning. You can film all you want, you’re welcome to, but you are trespassing, and if you don’t leave right now I’m going to arrest you.”\n\nKansas City Food Not Bombs said in a social media post Wednesday that police forced all of its volunteers to leave the area and dispersed anyone arriving for its meal under threat of further arrests.\n\n“Food is a human right,” the group said. “We have the right to public spaces, and the right to demonstration.”\n\nIn an email to The Star Saturday, Officer Alayna Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for the Kansas City Police Department, said police received “multiple complaints from nearby businesses and residents after asking this organization to leave their private property.” She said police took an initial report about the complaints on Jan. 1.\n\n“The two individuals observed being arrested in the video shared had been previously trespassed and refused to leave, resulting in a response from KCPD,” she wrote.\n\nMichael McConnell, a Kansas City resident and one of the two volunteers charged with trespassing, told The Star in an email Friday that he and the other volunteer were not informed they had been officially trespassed until their arrests. McConnell confirmed that he and the other volunteer were arrested for allegedly trespassing in the parking lot of the strip mall where the free meal is served.\n\nHe said the group has been serving meals at that location for around 13 years, and has never had any negative encounters with Kansas City police previously. In fact, he noted, the police department lists the group and its weekly meal as a community nutrition resource on its website.\n\nMcConnell said some business owners in the area have claimed that those who show up for the meals the group serves have “caused trouble in their businesses, supposedly shoplifting, and messes,” he said. The group has been respectful and regularly cleans up trash in the area, he said.\n\n“We cannot be responsible for every action taken by one of the scores of neighbors that we help at some point after they come by our tables,” he said.\n\nKansas City Food Not Bombs sets up an outdoor food line on the edge of the sidewalk for an hour to an hour and a half and serves 50-100 meals and hundreds of pounds of bread and produce each week, McConnell said. Items served include peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, soup, pasta, salad and coffee, and most of the food comes from grocery stores and restaurants and would otherwise go to waste, he said.\n\nHe said Kansas City Food Not Bombs planned to adapt its serving setup to avoid trespassing charges in the future, and said the group hoped to continue to be good neighbors to people and businesses on Independence Avenue.\n\n“Like all other Food Not Bombs groups,” he said, “we do this as a protest against the wastefulness of war, the choice by the government to not solve poverty, and the environmental destruction caused by our wasteful food systems.”",

    "description": "I flew first class with Delta for the first time. I was surprised by the food, in-seat amenities, and bathroom products.",
    "fullText": "I've been seeing Sky Priority signs in Delta terminals for years, but I never stopped to read them before flying first class.\n\nSky Priority is essentially a fast lane through check-in and security for Delta Medallion Members and premium-class passengers. Although not all of these perks are available at every airport, both were present at John F. Kennedy International Airport, where I flew out of. My first-class ticket also included two checked bags, but I didn't have any.\n\nI have TSA PreCheck, which was faster than the Sky Priority security lane, according to the airline employee I spoke with. Still, I thought this was a nice perk for travelers who aren't enrolled in the program.\n\nBeing among the first to board the aircraft was a completely new experience for me. Once inside the first-class cabin, I spotted a mini water bottle at every seat. As I was settling in, a flight attendant came by to take our beverage orders.\n\nI wasn't expecting such quick service, and I hadn't considered what other drink I'd want. I was also nervous as a first-timer in the cabin, so I just blurted out \"no, thank you\" without thinking. The attendant handed me another bottle of water anyway.\n\nAs the economy passengers began filtering in, many passengers in my cabin were already sipping on coffee or soda.\n\nI'm used to finding power outlets, USB ports, and audio jacks on the seat in front of me. In first class, all of these amenities were above my armrest.\n\nBefore meal service, flight attendants asked us to pull out our tray tables. This is when I realized there was no tray table on the seat in front of me. Confused, I observed the passenger beside me pull theirs out from the armrest and unfold it. It was bigger than any tray table I'd ever used.\n\nThe flight included complimentary breakfast, and a flight attendant came around with a basket of snacks before and after meal service. There seemed to be no limit on how many we could take.\n\nI thought the complimentary breakfast menu would be basic — maybe an egg sandwich or oatmeal. So I was surprised when the flight attendant listed the options: a potato and bacon frittata, Greek yogurt with chia pudding, or a dark chocolate pistachio bread pudding.\n\nCraving a balanced meal, I ordered the frittata, and I'm glad I did. Unlike most airplane food I've tried, the dish was well seasoned with a variety of textures and flavors. There was a side of bacon with a sweet maple glaze, sautéed spinach, and cherry tomatoes that paired well with the potato-filled frittata.\n\nThe meal also came with two sides I didn't anticipate — yogurt and a croissant.\n\nI didn't even need to use the bathroom during the short flight, but I had to see if it was any different from the ones in economy class.\n\nIt had the same small size and layout, but there was one key difference — the products. The hand soap and lotion were from Grown Alchemist, a luxury skincare brand. These products are exclusive to first class, a Delta representative told Business Insider.\n\nTypically, I consider the start of a vacation to be when I arrive at my destination. The flight is nothing more than a means to an end.\n\nHowever, with VIP treatment, flying first class made me feel like I was on vacation from the moment I stepped on board. And to me, that was the biggest surprise of all.",

    "description": "As someone born and raised in India, I've seen a lot of first-time visitors make avoidable mistakes when planning trips, eating street food, and more.",
    "fullText": "As someone who's lived in India my whole life, I've seen it all: the chaos of a Delhi market at noon, the quiet streets of a Rajasthan village, and the seemingly endless railway platforms where people jostle for a spot on a train.\n\nVisitors often come expecting a single \"India experience,\" but having lived in big cities and small towns, I know that the country changes every few hundred miles.\n\nWith different cuisine and customs in every part of the country, it's no wonder first-time visitors to India are often unprepared. Here are the mistakes I see tourists make again and again — and how to avoid them.\n\nMany first-timers fly into Delhi, rush to Agra for the Taj Mahal, and then stop in Jaipur for forts and palaces, believing they've \"done India.\"\n\nThis route, known as the \"Golden Triangle,\" is iconic, but it's also one of the country's most crowded tourist circuits, where hourslong lines and heavy traffic can overshadow the experience.\n\nThat fast, checklist style of travel shows only one version of India: frenetic, historic, and packed with people.\n\nInstead, I'd recommend ditching the crowds and exploring other areas. Some of my favorite underrated parts of India include the cold deserts of Ladakh and Spiti.\n\nDon't skip rural India, either. Well over half of India's population lives in villages, and in my opinion, spending time in one can teach you more about the country than any monument.\n\nWalking through a small-town market and chatting with local families can give tourists a real sense of daily life.\n\nMany travelers try to see all of India in just one or two weeks, but getting from one city to another can take most of a day due to traffic, road conditions, or transportation delays.\n\nPlus, it'll be harder to enjoy everything India has to offer if you're frequently exhausted from a grueling travel experience.\n\nI believe it's better to focus on one city or state at a time.\n\nFor example, you can spend two weeks in Kerala exploring canals, stunning hills, and spice plantations; meanwhile, a trip to Rajasthan can include visits to many colorful cities and the fresco-rich Shekhawati region.\n\nMost travelers skip street food, fearing \"Delhi Belly\" — that is, traveler's diarrhea — but doing so means missing some of India's iconic local flavors.\n\nEach city has its specialties, from Mumbai's vada pav (a potato fritter between buns) to Varanasi's chaat (a savory street snack) to Kolkata's kathi rolls (a kebab rolled inside a flatbread with onions and sauce).\n\nTo enjoy street food safely, I recommend generally following the crowds, since high turnover usually means fresh food.\n\nI'd also suggest avoiding consuming anything cold or raw unless you can peel it yourself, and refraining from using ice unless it's made from bottled water — tap water isn't safe to drink here.\n\nIf you're nervous, you can also book a guided street-food tour. These are available in most major cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Jaipur, and Varanasi.\n\nIndia is famously hospitable: The Sanskrit saying \"Atithi Devo Bhava,\" or \"the guest is god,\" exists for a reason.\n\nThat said, paying attention to some basic customs doesn't take much effort, and it will likely make your interactions smoother and earn you some goodwill.\n\nAcross the country, it's respectful to remove shoes before entering temples or homes, and also to dress modestly, especially in rural areas and religious sites.\n\nI'd also recommend avoiding public displays of affection, as it can make some locals uncomfortable. Finally, use your right hand for eating or passing items, since the left is traditionally considered unclean.\n\nWith 28 states and eight union territories, India's customs can vary widely, so it's also wise to check local etiquette before your trip.\n\nSo much in India runs on WhatsApp messages and OTPs (one-time passwords), so you'll need a local SIM to pay for a cab ride or buy train tickets.\n\nI suggest buying a SIM card at the airport upon arrival, or using an eSIM. Preload it with enough data for your entire trip; adding more later can sometimes be tricky with foreign cards.\n\nWhile you're at it, take out some cash, too. The Indian rupee is our only official currency, and although many shops and restaurants accept digital payments, it's smart to carry cash for smaller vendors at local markets.",

    "description": "We took a long, international flight on Singapore Airlines' business class. For my family, the best part was the food, but I had issues with the seat.",
    "fullText": "When I booked a family trip from Copenhagen to Singapore, I knew we were facing a 13-hour overnight flight.\n\nFlying with my husband and our 7-year-old son meant comfort wasn't just a luxury — it was a necessity. So, we splurged on business class, using points to bring the cost down to something we could justify.\n\nHere's what it was like — the highs, the lows, and the key thing that made it worthwhile.\n\nA deal popped up on discount search engine seats.aero that seemed too good to pass up: Singapore Airlines business-class seats from Copenhagen to Singapore, bookable through Air Canada's Aeroplan program, for just 80,000 points per person.\n\nSingapore Airlines has a reputation for having one of the best business-class experiences in the world, and the thought of spending 13 hours in lie-flat comfort — especially with a child — was incredibly appealing.\n\nWe transferred our American Express points to Air Canada and booked the seats, paying only about $100 per person in taxes and fees.\n\nThat flight, which could easily cost over $15,000 for three passengers, cost us just over $300 out of pocket.\n\nWhen we boarded the Airbus A350-900, the first thing I noticed was how wide the seats looked. At about 28 inches wide, there was plenty of room for my husband and me, and our son could stretch out without feeling cramped.\n\nEven better, the seats were equipped with numerous compartments — small storage areas for headphones, snacks, books, and charging devices.\n\nAs a parent, I loved being able to keep things organized instead of digging through one overflowing bag the entire flight.\n\nI loved that you could control the seatback setup either directly on the screen or with a pull-out remote. That flexibility made it simple for all of us to watch what we wanted.\n\nThe complimentary noise-canceling headphones were another highlight. They blocked out the hum of the cabin, allowing me actually to enjoy a movie without distraction.\n\nThe food turned out to be one of the highlights of the flight. I started with stuffed chicken paired with potatoes and mushrooms — a flavorful and surprisingly restaurant-quality dish.\n\nWe also tried the oriental-style braised beef cheek, which was tender and rich.\n\nBeyond the formal meal service, there was also an \"anytime\" menu. At any point during the flight, you could order a sandwich, a bowl of egg-noodle soup, or a variety of small snacks.\n\nWe didn't lean on it this time, but as a parent, I loved knowing it was there in case my son got hungry outside of meal times.\n\nAnother unexpected perk: I was able to order a proper latte in the morning. Usually, I avoid airplane coffee altogether, but this was actually good — smooth, not burnt-tasting, and served with a bit of flair in a real mug.\n\nIt felt like a small luxury, but after hours in the air, it made a big difference.\n\nFor me, one downside was the way the seat converted into a bed.\n\nInstead of just reclining with a button, we had to stand up and have the flight attendant flip our seats over. Not great when you're already half-asleep.\n\nAnd once it was a bed, the surface felt surprisingly firm. Since I have back problems, this was not ideal, and it was challenging to find a comfortable position.\n\nHowever, it was certainly better than sleeping upright.\n\nThe lie-flat seat sort of forces your legs into a diagonal position, which can make it difficult to relax during such a long flight.\n\nMy husband and I both found ourselves shifting around trying to get comfortable.\n\nFor our son, though, it was perfect. The smaller frame of a 7-year-old fit right into the angled nook, and he slept soundly while we tossed and turned.\n\nWould I pay cash for this flight? Probably not — the angled footwell and hard bed weren't quite worth the usual five-figure price tag.\n\nHowever, this flight was absolutely worth spending points on.\n\nThe wide seats, smart storage, strong entertainment system, tasty meals, and polished service all combined to make the journey manageable — especially with a child in tow.\n\nAnd arriving in Singapore rested enough to start exploring right away was the ultimate payoff.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nancy Green, the CEO of Beyond Yoga, who's based in the San Francisco Bay Area. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've spent my entire career in retail, starting in college, where I worked on the shop floor. I spent nearly three decades with Gap Inc., across two stints, raising four kids while building global brands. One of the highlights was scaling Athleta from a $250 million business to a billion-dollar powerhouse.\n\nIn 2022, I joined Levi Strauss & Co. to lead the Beyond Yoga brand. This brand feels like a perfect fit for me — it sits right at the intersection of wellness, joy, and community.\n\nI do a lot of workouts. I love yoga classes, Pilates, lifting weights, and hiking — all in Beyond Yoga wear, of course.\n\nHere's what a typical day looks like for me.\n\nI wake up around 6 am, whether I'm at home in the Bay Area or Los Angeles, to go into the office. The first thing I need is coffee. My husband makes a beautiful latte when he's around, but I'm perfectly happy to make one myself.\n\nI quickly scan emails and the news to see if there's anything urgent. Then I carve out time for movement. I'm not wedded to one routine — I enjoy mixing it up.\n\nIn the Bay Area, I'll lace up my sneakers and hike right out my back door into the hills, surrounded by nature. In LA, I'll either go for a power walk outside or head to the gym in my apartment building. I alternate between strength training and cardio during the week, and I reserve Pilates or yoga for the weekends.\n\nI aim for 35-45 minutes of exercise per day. That time isn't just about fitness — it's when I set my intentions. The way you walk into the office matters. My role is to read the moment and set the right tone.\n\nI shower, get dressed, and usually have a high-protein breakfast of Greek yogurt with organic berries.\n\nTuesdays are early flight days. I'm up at 4:45 am to head to the airport and fly to LA, where I stay for three to four days. I keep an apartment there so I can drop my bags and get straight to work.\n\nWhat drains me is unnecessary negative energy. I don't expect everyone to be positive all the time, but constant negativity that isn't productive can be exhausting. That's why I protect my energy and focus on bringing an upbeat, optimistic tone into the office.\n\nMost days, I arrive at the Beyond Yoga office by 9 a.m. That first stretch of the morning is usually about setting the agenda.\n\nTuesdays start with a business update meeting: What did we learn last week? What's trending? What needs adjusting? It gives everyone clarity and momentum.\n\nWe design and manufacture all our own products, so the quality of our fabrics is of the utmost importance. They need to be beautiful, durable, and versatile — pants that look just as good on the trails of Marin County as they do on the streets of New York.\n\nI'm a creature of habit with food. Breakfast is always protein-forward, and lunch is nearly always a salad.\n\nIn LA, there's nothing right near the office, so I either order delivery or I stop by Erewhon. True confession — I'm an Erewhon member. I don't buy everything there, but I really love their salads.\n\nMy assistant does her best to keep 45 minutes protected, although sometimes business intrudes and someone needs to run something by me while I'm eating.\n\nAfternoons can be intense. We run on a quarterly \"concept to customer\" cycle, and the milestone meetings that anchor it can last multiple days. We'll review samples for next year's line, align on design direction, and make critical investment decisions.\n\nOn other afternoons, I'll be in creative reviews, reviewing brand campaigns, or engaging in strategy conversations about real estate and store growth. There's always a decision that needs to be made quickly, or a trend that requires a response.\n\nThings come at me constantly. Sometimes it's a genuine crisis, and other times it's something personal, such as when a child is ill. You must lead through all of it and shift your focus when necessary.\n\nThere will always be curveballs, but as a leader, you can't let them derail you. Staying calm and steady matters. I need to be able to react, pivot, and refocus, but I can't be effective if every unexpected moment throws me off.\n\nI often pop into a store on my way home because we're trying something that I want to see for myself. Fridays are sacred, and I spend them in our stores.\n\nI grew up in retail on the shop floor, and I love being where the energy is — seeing how product shows up, hearing directly from customers, and connecting with store teams. It's the best way to keep the feedback loop alive.\n\nI try to finish by 6-7 p.m. at the latest. That habit stems from raising my kids, when family dinners were a non-negotiable part of our routine. Even though they're grown, I still anchor myself to that rhythm.\n\nEvenings are about balance — sometimes it's a business dinner, other nights I'll cook with my husband. I might pour a glass of wine, catch up on the news I missed during the day, or relax with a good series on Netflix or Apple TV. I just finished \"Ripple.\"\n\nI'm not rigid, but I prioritize sleep: if I'm up at 6 a.m., I need to be asleep by 10 p.m. so I can get a full eight hours.\n\nLeading a brand through growth takes stamina, so I prioritize wellness and surround myself with great people. You have to do what you love and love what you do — I feel lucky that after decades in this industry, I still do.",

    "fullText": "Back in the 1980s, rotisserie chicken may have existed, but it was not a staple in the way it has become today.\n\nCostco, for example, which has become well-known for selling an entire rotisserie chicken for $4.99, did not actually start selling the popular item until 1994.\n\n\"The famous $4.99 chicken made its official Costco debut in 1994. Aside from a brief dollar increase in 2008 during the Great Recession, Costco has remained committed to keeping the chicken’s price steady despite ongoing inflation,\" according to Eat This, Not That.\n\nThe warehouse club actually loses money selling its popular chicken. But Rose Sioson, founder of Deliciously Rushed and an avid Costco shopper, thinks Costco more than makes up for it just by getting customers through the door for that value chicken.\n\n“Costco may technically lose money on each rotisserie chicken they sell, but trust me —they’re not losing when it comes to what I buy next,” Sioson told. “That chicken usually ends up in a cart with salad kits, ready-made mashed potatoes, a bottle of wine, maybe a dessert, and some random item I had zero intention of buying. It’s classic Costco strategy.”\n\nWhen a major retailer sells your core product as a loss leader, that's never great for business, but that's only one reason why Boston Market has been pushed to the edge of being fully out of existence.\n\nWhen I was a child growing up outside of Boston in the 1980s, my aunt used to visit, and she often brought a chicken from what was then known as Boston Chicken. At the time, the company was a small local chain that was actually founded in a Boston suburb.\n\nThis was the first time I had been exposed to rotisserie chicken, and the concept quickly took off. McDonald's was even an investor for a brief period.\n\nPeak footprint: Boston Market once had over 1,200 U.S. restaurants at its national height in the 1990s.\n The drop from 1,200 to 300 took place from the late '90s to 2023.\n\n2023-2024 decline: The chain shrank precipitously from 300 locations at the start of 2023 to fewer than 30 by early 2024, according to Restaurant Business Online.\n\nEarly 2025 footprint: Estimates indicate fewer than 20 locations remain open nationally in early 2025, with many stores disappearing without notice, a stark collapse from its former scale, added Flavor365.\n\nFluid numbers: Official company listings on websites and apps significantly overstate open stores; many listed units are confirmed closed, reported Restaurant Business Online.",

    "description": "The USDA first published guidance in 1980, then a food pyramid in 1992 and a 2011 \"MyPlate\" version. Here's how they stack up to RFK's new pyramid.",
    "fullText": "For 46 years, the government has been trying to give us advice on how to eat better.\n\nIn 1980, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans were introduced, after lawmakers took notice of how some modern eating habits were fueling a rise in chronic diseases like heart disease, cancer, strokes, high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity.\n\nThe very first guidelines looked like they were torn from a recipe book and were very basic principles.\n\nThe first guidelines didn't give people any visual aids for how to plan their daily diet, only prioritizing that people eat a variety of nutritious foods, including fruits and veggies, whole grains, dairy, meat, eggs, and beans.\n\n\"You need about 40 different nutrients to stay healthy,\" the guidelines said. \"Most foods contain more than one nutrient. Milk, for example, provides proteins, fats, sugars, riboflavin and other B-vitamins, vitamin A, calcium, and phosphorus — among other nutrients.\" But it doesn't have much iron or vitamin C. \"You should, therefore, eat a variety of foods to assure an adequate diet.\"\n\nIn 1992, 34 years ago, the US released its first food pyramid, giving people more specific guidance about how much to eat each day:\n\nHere, grains like bread, cereal, rice, and pasta were touted as the foundation of a balanced diet — the recommendation in the chart was six to 11 servings of grains per day.\n\nThe second priority, you were told, was to add in at least two to three servings of fruits and veggies each day.\n\nFinally, layer on top some protein from meat, eggs, beans, and nuts, as well as dairy.\n\nFat and sugar, which comprise more than a third of the typical American diet, were a side note.\n\nNutrition experts widely agree that six to 11 servings of bread per day is too much, crowding out space in your stomach for other important nutrients. Plus, they say, it's not just which food groups you eat, but the quality of each: whole grains are better than white bread, nuts and olive oil healthier fats than lard or bacon.\n\nDuring the first Obama administration, in 2011, the government introduced \"My Plate,\" which was meant to simplify our nutrition advice, but only added confusion, with four incredibly generic quadrants of a plate.\n\nThe portions of \"vegetables\" and \"grains\" were slightly larger than those of \"fruits\" and \"protein,\" and a glass of \"dairy\" was served on the side.\n\nCritics said this nutrition advice was oversimplified, with no mention of healthy versus unhealthy foods, no mention of portion sizes, and no room for diverse diets. After all, a \"grain\" could be a donut, or it could be some oatmeal.\n\nStill, nutritionists say a more specific version of this kind of \"plate method,\" trying to make roughly half of your plate vegetables and the other half a solid mix of carbs and protein, is a halfway decent diet strategy.\n\nThe Trump Administration released its 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans on Wednesday, a document that will guide federal nutrition policy for schoolchildren and military cafeterias, and also serves as a consumer's guide to healthier eating.\n\nThe big tagline this time is \"eat real food,\" a motto meant to encourage people to consume less ultra-processed foods, skip added sugar, and eat more whole foods.\n\n\"I agree entirely that we should eat real food,\" Professor Joan Sabaté, a nutrition expert who was one of the independent scientific advisors for the former 2020-2025 edition of the Dietary Guidelines, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Eat real food is an outstanding message. Yes. Reduce or eliminate highly processed foods, I think, is a good message. Reduce sugar is a good message,\" he said.\n\nSabaté is less thrilled with how the pyramid is designed to prominently favor red meat as the cornerstone of any healthy diet.\n\n\"Our eyes, when we have a document, or we have a screen in front of us, move from left to right and from top to bottom,\" he said. \"So the way this pyramid has been designed is that the first food that you see in the top left corner is beef.\"\n\nMeat can be part of a healthy diet, he said, but it shouldn't be so prominent.\n\n\"The scientific consensus is that plant-based diets are the healthiest diets as far as preventing chronic diseases. And there is no new evidence saying that animal-based diets are better for health and preventing diseases. There is no evidence of that,\" he said. \"People can also consume animal products, but they shouldn't be the majority of the energy on the plate.\"\n\n(The experts who helped draft these guidelines have disclosed ties to the beef and dairy industries.)\n\nOlive oil is a healthier fat than butter or beef tallow. Nuts are a great snack. Sabaté has concerns about kidney issues and cholesterol if people shun healthy carbs like oats, whole-grain bread, or quinoa, in favor of more meat and dairy.\n\n\"This pyramid, it prompts the American public to eat more animal products,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "I spent six hours and $630 on the fastest train in America.\n\nThe Amtrak Acela is the express option for travelers in the Northeast with only business and first-class seating. In August 2025, the route got a fresh new fleet called the NextGen Acela. In addition to a futuristic look and modern amenities, the train has a top speed of 160 miles per hour, making it the fastest train in the US.\n\nIn September 2025, I booked round-trip tickets between my home in New York City and Washington, DC, on the NextGen Acela. I got a taste of both classes.\n\nSince the Acela doesn't have coach seating, business class is the standard ticket.\n\nMy first-class ticket included a meal, priority boarding, attendant service, and lounge access at the train station.\n\nI waited for my business-class train to Washington, DC, on the floor of NYC's Penn Station. The waiting room was full, and it would have cost me $50 to access the Metropolitan Lounge, which is complimentary for first-class passengers.\n\nSince I held a first-class ticket for my ride home from Washington, DC, I had access to the Metropolitan Lounge at Union Station. Other passengers can pay $35 to enter the space.\n\nThe lounge was quiet and calm. There were couches, comfy chairs, tables, and colorful works of art on the walls. I especially appreciated the espresso and beverage station, snack bins stocked with a variety of treats — all of which were complimentary — and the clean bathroom.\n\nAfter relaxing in the lounge, I waltzed into the priority boarding lane for my first-class ride to New York. There were fewer than a dozen people in front of me.\n\nUnlike when I rode in business class, where I was toward the back of a long line, I had several minutes to get situated on board before the train departed.\n\nAboard the Acela train, I quickly caught on that blue meant business class and red meant first class. From the headrests to the bathroom doors, the matching colors made it easy to tell which car I was in.\n\nAnother key difference was the layout. There were two rows of seats on either side of the aisle in business class, while first class had a single row of seats on one side of the aisle.\n\nDuring my business-class ride, I grabbed a bite in the café car, where passengers can purchase grab-and-go meals from a self-service station, as well as snacks, drinks, and quick hot meals prepared by an attendant. I ordered a breakfast sandwich, which I thought tasted pretty decent for a microwaved meal, and brought it back to my seat.\n\nIn first class, I received attendant service and had a menu of complimentary meals to choose from.\n\nI selected the chicken dish, which consisted of a charred thigh paired with roasted squash, verde sauce, a hard roll, and a Key-lime pie in a jar.\n\nIt was the most delicious and satisfying meal I'd ever had on an Amtrak train.\n\nSave for the color of the door, the bathrooms in each class are the same, an Amtrak representative told Business Insider. I was impressed by how clean, spacious, and high-tech they were.\n\nThese bathrooms featured automatic doors, lights to indicate when the space was in use, and ample room to stretch. I also appreciated the touch-free faucets, soap dispensers, and hand dryers.\n\nAfter my back-to-back three-hour journeys on the Amtrak NextGen Acela train, I expected to be thrilled to get off the rails. But my experiences were so comfortable that I was in no rush to exit. When we pulled into NYC's Penn Station, I let other passengers get off first while I soaked up a few more minutes in my first-class seat.",

    "fullText": "State residents worth more than $1bn could face one-off, 5% tax to help fund education, food assistance and healthcare\n\nA battle is brewing in California over a plan to tax billionaires – with tech titans divided over whether they should pay up, or flee the state.\n\nUnder a tax proposal that could be put to voters this November, any California resident worth more than $1bn would have to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state.\n\nSeveral Silicon Valley figures have already threatened to leave California and take their business elsewhere. But Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia whose net worth is nearly $159bn, told Bloomberg Television this week that he is “perfectly fine with it”.\n\n“We chose to live in Silicon Valley,” Huang said. “And whatever taxes I guess they would like to apply, so be it.”\n\nThis puts Huang in stark contrast with Google co-founder Larry Page, Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, the venture capitalist David Sacks, all of whom have recently indicated they’re leaving California for tax-friendlier states including Florida and Texas.\n\nThe tax proposal is being led by the labor union Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West. If passed, the tax would retroactively apply to residents as of 1 January, and billionaires would have five years to pay it.\n\nThis means Huang would pay roughly $7bn and Page and Thiel would pay one-time amounts of about $13bn and $1.3bn, respectively, based on their current net worth.\n\n“What remains undeniable is the underlying unfairness of the current system,” Suzanne Jimenez, the chief of staff for SEIU-UHW, said in an email. “Regular working people pay higher effective tax rates than the wealthiest Americans … Asking those who have benefited most from the economy to contribute more – particularly to stabilize health care systems under direct threat – is a reasonable step.”\n\nThe proposal is still in the beginning phases. Under California law, it needs to collect 874,641 signatures to qualify for the state ballot in November. It would also need to be signed by California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, who has said he opposes the wealth tax.\n\n“You can’t isolate yourself from the 49 others,” Newsom said when asked about wealth taxes during the New York Times DealBook Summit last month. “We’re in a competitive environment.”\n\nThis puts Newsom at odds with Ro Khanna, the California representative who represents Silicon Valley and who has championed the idea of a wealth tax. Khanna says tech billionaires will likely stay in the state, despite a tax, because California is where the larger industry, innovation and talent pool are located. “A billionaire tax is good for American innovation,” Khanna said, adding that it would spread the wealth to other sectors.\n\nWhen Thiel indicated he was leaving California because of the proposed tax, Khanna posted to X: “I echo what FDR said with sarcasm of economic royalists when they threatened to leave, ‘I will miss them very much.’”\n\nThis is not California’s first billionaire exodus. Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, famously departed for Texas in 2020, which stood to save him millions in taxes. He has also shifted several of his companies’ headquarters there. Most recently, in 2024, Musk announced he was moving SpaceX to Texas because of a California law that aimed to protect transgender children in schools. He called the law a “final straw”.\n\nOther tech billionaires have also decamped to Texas, which has no state income tax. Citing a better tax environment, Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale moved to Austin in 2020, and Larry Ellison transitioned Oracle’s headquarters there in 2020 (he has since said he’s moving the company to Nashville). Michael Dell, the founder of Dell Technologies, has long lived in Texas.\n\nSacks made his announcement on 31 December, posting an image of the Texas flag on X and saying: “God bless Texas.” In a separate post the following day, Sacks wrote: “As a response to socialism, Miami will replace NYC as the finance capital and Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.”\n\nMusk, Lonsdale and Dell all responded with hearty welcomes. “No one will fight harder for the independent and free spirit of Texas than people who know [sic] it’s like when that’s taken away,” Musk wrote.\n\nPage has not publicly said where he’s moving, but in December companies associated with the Google co-founder filed documents to incorporate in Florida, according to the New York Times. Thiel, who owns a home in the Hollywood Hills, also seems to have set his sights on Florida. His investment firm, Thiel Capital, announced on 31 December that it had opened an office in Miami. The firm said Thiel has maintained a personal residence in the city since 2020.\n\nOn X, tech investors and other billionaires have blasted the proposed wealth tax. Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist and former Facebook executive, said that without billionaires, California’s “budget deficit will only get bigger”, and Vinod Khosla, another investor, said that under the proposed tax, “California will lose its most important taxpayers and net off much worse”.\n\nSome have indicated they’d work to oust Khanna from Congress. Martin Casado, a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, wrote that Khanna had “devolved into an obnoxious jerk” and that his support of the wealth tax had alienated him from moderates. In response, Garry Tan, the CEO of the startup accelerator Y Combinator, wrote: “Time to primary him.”\n\nThe SEIU’s Jimenez said states like Massachusetts and Washington, which have other forms of wealth taxes, have seen billions of dollars raised to help the state. At the same time, she said, high-income residents have continued to see their portfolios grow. Jimenez added that the union is “heartened” by Huang’s recent comments and is hopeful that more billionaires will follow suit.\n\nAs for Huang, he said Nvidia is in Silicon Valley because that’s where the engineers are and he’s not worried about a billionaire tax.\n\n“Not this person,” Huang said. “This person is trying to build the future of AI.”\n\nRepresentatives for Page, Thiel, Sacks and Newsom did not return requests for comment.",

    "description": "Kennedy said his new guidelines undo previous advice. Full fat dairy is back, sugar is out, and highly processed foods come under fire.",
    "fullText": "That's the stated intention of the new Dietary Guidelines for Americans, released Wednesday by the federal government.\n\n\"Real food is back at the center of the American diet,\" a video from the Department of Health and Human Services says, on the government's new realfood.gov website.\n\nThe federal guidelines, which are updated every five years, serve as a guidepost for nutrition and health advice and form the basis for federal food programs, such as the National School Lunch Program, as well as meals and snacks for the military, veterans, and preschoolers in Head Start.\n\nThe new realfood.gov site claims that Americans have been \"misled\" by previous guidelines, an idea that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. echoed Wednesday at the White House.\n\n\"The hard truth is that our government has been lying to us to protect corporate profit-taking, telling us that these food-like substances were beneficial to public health,\" he said. \"These new guidelines will revolutionize our nation's food culture and Make America Healthy Again.\"\n\nIn 1992, the food pyramid was introduced into the guidelines, encouraging bread and pasta to form the basis of the American diet:\n\nThe original food pyramid has been heavily criticized for being too cozy with food lobbyists, particularly in the grains industry, as it prioritized more bread, cereal, rice, and pasta than sound nutrition advice would recommend.\n\nIt was replaced in 2011 by \"My Plate,\" a new framework meant to simplify how people thought about building their daily meals. Vegetables, protein, and grains were prominent on the plate, with an emphasis on consuming more whole grains:\n\nUnder Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \"Make America Healthy Again\" campaign, a new upside-down pyramid was unveiled on Wednesday:\n\nThe new pyramid deliberately de-prioritizes whole grains by flipping the triangle upside down — even though it's not a true inversion of the old pyramid, which had \"bad\" ingredients, like sweets, fats, and oils, at the top.\n\nThe new pyramid has as its cornerstone protein and \"healthy\" fat, which Kennedy said \"are essential and were wrongly discouraged in prior dietary guidelines.\"\n\nFor the first time, the new guidelines encourage people to prioritize \"high-quality, nutrient-dense\" protein at each meal.\n\nAnimal sources are recommended, such as eggs, poultry, seafood, and red meat, even though most nutritionists would encourage a focus on lean proteins like chicken, fish, and plants like beans, nuts, and seeds, with less red meat.\n\nThe daily protein serving goal, at 1.2-1.6 grams per kilogram of your body weight, is generally in line with what dietitians and protein experts recommend. For example, a 150-pound person would be aiming for about 82 to 109 grams of protein every day on this plan, far more than previous guidelines would suggest.\n\n\"We are ending the war on saturated fats,\" Kennedy said Wednesday.\n\nThe new guidelines encourage consumers to \"include full-fat dairy,\" which is a somewhat controversial stance among nutritionists, especially when it comes to foods like butter and milk.\n\nChristopher Gardner, a nutrition expert at Stanford who was on the expert panel convened in 2024 to advise health authorities on the new dietary guidelines, had said in a previous committee meeting that \"butter is not back\" — at least, not according to any new scientific data.\n\nGardner raised concerns about how butter can raise your LDL cholesterol, in particular, affecting the arteries.\n\nThere is more scientific debate about full-fat cheese and full-fat yogurt, because of the unique ways that calcium and protein are arranged in those foods.\n\nThe new guidelines also highlight the importance of fermented foods, including the dairy item kefir, for promoting a healthy microbiome, which is something nutrition experts and scientists are increasingly emphasizing.\n\nUltra-processed foods are in the crosshairs of the new guidelines. Evidence has been mounting for years that these foods tend to make people eat more calories, and can promote inflammation and, over time, contribute to chronic health issues.\n\n\"If a foreign adversary sought to destroy the health of our children, to cripple our economy, to weaken our national security, there would be no better strategy than to addict us to ultra-processed foods,\" Kennedy said.\n\nNutrition experts say it's generally true that ultra-processed foods are not great, but the composition of those foods still matters. UPFs with more vegetables and whole grains in them are better choices than sugary beverages and sweets. Some studies have suggested that certain ultra-processed items like packaged yogurts with added sugar and industrial whole-grain cereals may not be so detrimental to our health after all.\n\nIn the new pyramid, there is no place for a sugar bowl, because \"added sugars are not part of eating real foods.\"\n\nThe new pyramid recommended avoiding added sugars entirely, while allowing naturally occurring sugar from fruit and dairy.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the leading sources of added sugar in the American diet are sugar-sweetened beverages, desserts, and sweet snacks, so though it may be challenging to nix all added sugar in your diet, given the food landscape we live in, cutting back on those items is a simple place to start.",

    "title": "This Radar-Equipped Stove Shutoff Is One of the Most Practical Things I Saw at CES",
    "description": "The iGuard keeps seniors safe in the kitchen by reducing the chance of cooking fires.",
    "fullText": "Radar-based sensors seem to be having a moment at CES, especially in tech meant for people to keep tabs on their aging family members. One product in particular caught my eye because it’s focused on a single important function—preventing kitchen fires caused by a person wandering away from the stove.\n\niGuard is essentially a smart shutoff for a stove or cooktop. Its new, radar-equipped version costs $399 and can work on gas or electric stoves. (For gas, you’ll need to have a plumber install a shutoff valve.) If you leave the kitchen while cooking, a five-minute timer starts. If you don’t return by the time it goes off, the device either cuts the power to your electric stove, or shuts off the supply line to your gas stove. It can also notify a caregiver that a shutoff event occurred.\n\nA big theme in smart tech this year is aging-in-place. Most older adults would prefer to live at home as long as they can, but health challenges can make that difficult. When it comes to cooking or other activities that require a sharp mind, mental health issues like dementia come into play, as do medications that can have cognitive side effects. With all that in mind, caregivers often worry about a parent leaving the kitchen while cooking, forgetting that the stove is on.\n\nThe National Fire Protection Association reports that cooking fires are the top cause of home fires, the top cause of fire-related injuries, and the number three cause of fire-related deaths. Unattended cooking equipment causes half of those deaths. Older adults are overrepresented as fire casualties compared to younger and middle-aged people.\n\nThe device has a five-minute timer, specifically, because that was a safety margin the company developed with safety organization UL, chief marketing officer Jon Landers told me. You can also override the five-minute timer if you’re roasting a turkey or preparing a slow-simmered sauce. In this case you tell the device how long the food is expected to cook, and it lets this cook time complete before resetting to the usual five-minute timer behavior.\n\nA previous version, called the iGuardStove, used motion detectors, but if you’ve ever worked in an office that had lights on motion sensors, you know why that wasn’t a great solution: sit still at a table for too long, and the lights go off. The older version of the device could potentially shut off while you're just waiting for your dinner to cook, and could be triggered by motion from pets. Radar solves those problems, since it can more accurately identify when a person is in the room.\n\nI’ve been seeing radar in a number of aging-in-place products at CES this year. The Silver Shield from PontoSense uses radar to monitor a person’s presence and movement in a room, reporting movement and potential falls to a caregiver’s app. Luna, a conversation and reminder device from Cairns Health, includes radar that can monitor heart rate and breathing (even through blankets!) when positioned near a person’s bed. The iGuard has some monitoring features in common with those devices, but it stays focused on its main task of ensuring stoves aren’t left running unattended.\n\nRadar can “see” a lot, but it doesn’t feel quite as privacy-invading as a camera. Having a device in the kitchen is also a bit less intrusive than in a bedroom, for those who would feel creeped out knowing that a tech device is watching them sleep.\n\nBesides shutting off the stove, the iGuard can report to a caregiver (via an app, of course) things like what time each day a person first enters the kitchen. It can catch nighttime wandering if the person visits the kitchen at night; it can also send an alert if the person doesn’t seem to be up and active at their usual time. For example, if your mom usually makes coffee around 9:00 every morning, you can ask the app to notify you if the kitchen is still empty at 10:00.\n\nBesides shutting off the stove and reporting on the presence of a person in the kitchen, the iGuard has a few other clever features. The version of the device made for gas stoves can detect unburned gas, in case somebody left it on without a burner running.\n\nThe device can also be configured to keep the stove from being turned on by pets or children, or it can be locked to not allow cooking during certain hours or days (say, at night). The app can also alert a caregiver if temperatures get too hot or cold, prompting them to check in if a heat wave or a cold snap is bad enough to affect indoor temperatures.\n\nWhile a lot of products I’ve seen at CES are speculative or hopeful in their use cases—I often find myself asking “who would actually use this?”—the iGuard seems thoughtfully designed and has a concrete use case and benefit. I was impressed! The new device is expected to ship later this year.\n\nUpdate 1/7/2025 at 7:48 a.m. PST: Corrected to note that the new product is named iGuard, and the previous version with motion sensors was iGuardStove.",

    "title": "Common food preservatives linked to cancer and type 2 diabetes",
    "description": "Two large studies found a significant association between eating preservatives in many foods and a higher risk of type 2 diabetes and several cancers.",
    "fullText": "Common preservatives used to keep food safe and extend shelf life may be linked to a higher risk of several cancers and type 2 diabetes, according to two new studies from France.\n\n“These are very important findings for preservatives that are not only widely used in the French and European markets, but also in the United States,” said senior author Mathilde Touvier, principal investigator of the NutriNet-Santé study used to conduct the research.\n\nThe NutriNet-Santé study, which began in 2009, compares over 170,000 participants’ web-based reports on diet and lifestyle with their medical data stored in the French national health care system.\n\n“These are the two first studies in the world investigating the associations between exposure to these food additives and cancer and type 2 diabetes,” said Touvier, who is also the director of research at France’s National Institute of Health and Medical Research in Paris, “and so we must be very cautious about the message. Obviously, the results need to be confirmed.”\n\nDespite those caveats, “the concern raised about preservatives is one more reason among many to emphasize the personal and public health importance of fresh, whole, minimally processed foods, mostly plants,” Dr. David Katz said in an email.\n\nKatz, who was not involved in the study, is a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine who founded the nonprofit True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine.\n\nThe cancer study, published Wednesday in The BMJ journal, closely examined the impact of 58 preservatives on some 105,000 people who were free of cancer in 2009 and were followed for up to 14 years. Only those who completed frequent 24-hour, brand-specific food questionnaires were included. People who ate the most preservative-laced food were compared with those who ate the least.\n\nResearchers did a deep dive on 17 preservatives consumed by at least 10% of the participants and found 11 of those had no relationship with cancer. However, the six that were linked to cancer are considered GRAS, or “generally recognized as safe” in food by the US Food and Drug Administration. Those include sodium nitrite, potassium nitrate, sorbates, potassium metabisulfite, acetates and acetic acid.\n\nSodium nitrite, a chemical salt commonly used in processed meats such as bacon, ham and deli meats, was associated with a 32% increase in the risk of prostate cancer. It’s cousin, potassium nitrate, was associated with a 22% higher risk of breast cancer and a 13% increase in all cancers. The World Health Organization has long considered processed meat as a carcinogen, with a direct link to colon cancer.\n\nSorbates, especially potassium sorbate, were associated with a 26% higher risk for breast cancer and a 14% increase in all types of cancers. These water-soluble salts are used in wine, baked goods, cheeses and sauces to prevent molds, yeast and some bacteria.\n\nPotassium metabisulfite, often used in winemaking and brewing, was associated with a 20% increase in breast cancer and 11% higher risk of all cancers, according to the study.\n\nAcetates, which come from natural fermentation and are used in foods such as meat, sauces, breads and cheese, were linked to a 25% higher risk of breast cancer and 15% increase in cancer in general. Acetic acid, the main ingredient in vinegar, was associated with a 12% increase in the risk of all cancers, the study found.\n\nOther types of preservatives — antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, plant extracts like rosemary and such synthetic preservatives as butylated hydroxyanisole — were also studied. While these more “natural” preservatives are often linked to lower cancer risk when eaten as whole foods, they may be harmful when used as additives, Touvier said.\n\n“The hypothesis here is when you isolate one substance from its original matrix of a whole fruit or vegetable, the action on our health can be different depending on the way our gut microbiota will digest it,” she said.\n\nOnly two antioxidant preservatives were linked to cancer, the study found. Sodium erythorbate and other erythorbates, which are made from fermented sugars, were associated with a 21% higher incidence of breast cancer and 12% increase in cancer overall.\n\nErythorbates are used to prevent discoloration and spoilage in poultry, soft drinks and baked goods, to name a few. Sodium erythorbate is often used in processed meats to speed up the curing process.\n\nObservational studies are subject to error due to the lack of control over variables that might also influence outcomes. However, a major strength of this study was its ability to adjust for preservatives from natural sources and other food additives as well as its “detailed assessment of preservative intake, through repeated 24-hour dietary records,” according to an editorial published with the study.\n\n“We also looked at what colleagues have published on the impact of these preservative chemicals on animal models, cellular models, gut microbiota, oxidative stress and inflammatory processes which may explain what we observe,” Touvier said.\n\nIn addition, both studies controlled for such confounding factors as a physical activity, tobacco, alcohol use, medication use and lifestyle factors, Touvier said.\n\n“The finding that specific classes of preservatives are associated with increased risk of select cancers was robust to all of these adjustments, indicating it is a matter that warrants respect and requires further research,” Katz said.\n\nThe type 2 diabetes study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature Communications, examined the role of preservatives and the potential risk of type 2 diabetes in nearly 109,000 of the NutriNet-Santé participants who did not have the disease at the start of the study.\n\nTwelve of the 17 preservatives researchers examined were linked with nearly a 50% higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes in people who consumed the highest levels.\n\nFive of the same preservatives that caused cancer — potassium sorbate, potassium metabisulfite, sodium nitrite, acetic acid and sodium acetate — also raised the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In this case the probability rose by 49%, according to the research.\n\nA sixth preservative — calcium propionate — was also connected. It’s a white powder used to stop mold and bacterial growth.\n\nIn this study on type 2 diabetes, more than two antioxidant additives increased risk. Additives that increased risk by 42% included alpha-tocopherol, the most bioavailable form of vitamin E; sodium ascorbate, which is a buffered form of vitamin C and sodium; rosemary extracts; sodium erythorbate, made from fermented sugar; phosphoric acid, a preservative in sodas, processed meats, cheeses and other foods; and citric acid, a flavor enhancer, preservative and pH adjuster with no significant nutritional value.\n\nSince these two studies are the first to examine the role of preservatives in the development of cancer and type 2 diabetes, much more research will be required to confirm and expand the findings, said Anaïs Hasenböhler, the first author of both studies who is a doctoral student at the Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team at the Université Sorbonne Paris Nord.\n\nHowever, Hasenböhler added in a statement, “These new data add to others in favour of a reassessment of the regulations governing the general use of food additives by the food industry in order to improve consumer protection.”\n\nGet inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.",

    "description": "Food trends for 2026 include sweet-and-spicy flavors, bite-sized menu items, cabbage, and fast-casual Indian cuisine.",
    "fullText": "The new year brings a fresh crop of food trends, from sweet-and-spicy sauces to the hottest new vegetable hitting menus.\n\nWe looked at trend reports from Tastewise, Pinterest, Yelp, and more to identify nine of the biggest food trends you can expect to see in 2026.\n\nA few trends are informed by health attitudes and the rise of GLP-1 medications, like bite-sized versions of menu items and mocktails that reflect Gen Z's attitude toward alcohol.\n\nPrice and affordability also continue to be top of mind, but \"value\" — not just the price alone, but the amount of food you get for it — is a concept that fast-food chains and casual-dining restaurants are leaning into more than ever.\n\nHere are nine food trends that will be everywhere in 2026.\n\nWhile plant-based meat may have had its moment in the early 2020s — and while some leaders in the space remain optimistic — there's been a decline in sales year over year for popular plant-powered meat companies. For some, such as Beyond Meat, sales have been declining for a few years.\n\nAt the same time, 2026 trend reports highlight a return to \"real meat,\" with chefs and diners gravitating toward menu items such as steak frites, signature burgers, and wagyu beef to attract customers seeking to incorporate more protein into their diets.\n\nAccording to Tastewise's 2026 Trend Forecast, \"Consumers are turning away from 'fakeness' in ultra-processed substitutes, seeking foods that feel simple, transparent, and true to their origins,\" especially among fast-food menus, where meat-focused menu items have grown 11% year over year.\n\nMove over, kale: 2026 is poised to be the year of the cabbage.\n\nFrom kimchi dishes to cabbage spring rolls and salads, cabbage is gaining popularity among home cooks and restaurant owners, who have lauded the ingredient's versatility and affordability, as well as its high fiber content.\n\n\"Today's consumer is more open to exploring global cuisines than ever. Cabbage's versatility comes in handy, as it can be a part of tacos, rice bowls, noodles, and other culturally relevant dishes,\" Wesley Allan, a consumer insights analyst at Tastewise, told Business Insider.\n\nPinterest also reported that searches for cabbage dumplings have increased by 110%, and cabbage-focused dishes, such as golumpki, a Polish soup made from cabbage, ground beef, and tomato broth, are also seeing increased interest as we head into 2026.\n\nIn addition to protein, fiber-rich foods like Brussels sprouts, broccoli, sweet potatoes, legumes, and whole grains are enjoying popularity due to their ability to promote fullness and satiate appetites for longer compared to other foods.\n\nWhile naturally fiber-rich foods are increasingly appearing on restaurant menus, the \"fiber-maxing\" trend is also making its way into grocery aisles.\n\nShoppers can expect to see more packaged foods marketed for their fiber content, with new products like Smartfood Fiber Pop and SunChips Fiber signaling how brands are leaning into the trend.\n\nHowever, it's recommended you don't go all in right away: Dieticians warn against introducing too much fiber to your diet too quickly, which can cause digestive issues like constipation, abdominal pain, and nausea.\n\nFast-casual chains with Chipotle-style build-your-own concepts inspired by Indian cuisine, such as Inday, are helping introduce dishes like chicken tikka masala, paneer, and chickpea curry in approachable, on-the-go formats that are revolutionizing the \"slop bowl\" with new and innovative flavors.\n\nInday has experienced significant growth over the past few years, particularly since acquiring the vegan fast-casual concept Beatnic in 2024 and converting all of the brand's locations into Inday restaurants.\n\nSimilar expansion at Curry Up Now — a fast-casual Indian chain with 19 locations — underscores how fast-casual brands in the Indian category are positioning for national growth.\n\nWith the rise of GLP-1 medications, many customers are seeking smaller menu items in response to their reduced appetites. And, with 10% of the US population on some form of GLP-1, according to Rob Holston, the global and Americas consumer products sector leader at EY, the market for smaller, snackier menu items could be bigger than ever.\n\nLast year, McDonald's relaunched its iconic snack wraps in two flavors: spicy and ranch. While the new menu items hit the sweet spot in terms of affordability and nostalgia — two of the biggest food trends of 2025 — they also catered to something customers are craving: smaller, on-the-go items that aren't overly filling.\n\nEarlier this month, Shake Shack launched its new \"Good Fit Menu,\" featuring a variety of lettuce-wrapped burgers and chicken sandwiches for customers \"dialing up protein, cutting back, or simply eating with more intention.\"\n\nOther mini versions of popular products — such as snack-sized chip bags and Coke's mini cans — could also be seen in more stores this year as consumers seek smaller portions.\n\nRather than skipping drinks altogether, many younger consumers are opting for zero-proof cocktails that still feel special, meeting up with friends at dirty-soda shops, or opting for THC-infused drinks.\n\nAnother drinking trend among younger consumers is \"zebra-striping,\" in which you alternate between an alcoholic and a non-alcoholic drink each round.\n\n\"People still want to feel something,\" Jon Kreidler, cofounder of Tattersall Distilling Company, told Business Insider. \"They still want to partake and have something adult and feel something different to help them relax, help them calm down. But a lot of people, especially younger consumers, are just fed up with the hangovers and the negative effects, and so they're shifting away from alcohol.\"\n\nValue menus dominated fast food and casual dining in 2025 as inflation-weary consumers demanded more for their money, and the focus on affordability isn't going anywhere in 2026.\n\nChains have leaned into lower-priced bundles and fan-favorite deals to keep customers coming back, with McDonald's expanding its $5 Meal Deal, reviving snack wraps, and rolling out new Extra Value meal combos.\n\nCasual-dining brands followed suit, with Applebee's launching a value-focused lunch special, Olive Garden reintroducing its Endless Pasta option, and Chili's continuing to promote its popular \"3 for Me\" deal.\n\nAs consumers remain price-conscious, value-driven offerings continue to be popular among customers who want more value for their money.\n\nHot honey has firmly cemented itself as a go-to flavor across fast-food and casual-dining menus, building on years of steady growth.\n\nQSR magazine previously reported that menu mentions of hot honey jumped 187% between 2016 and 2020 — and the trend shows no signs of cooling off.\n\nIn recent months, chains including Red Robin, Chipotle, Panda Express, KFC, and Taco Bell have rolled out hot-honey-inspired items, often in partnership with Mike's Hot Honey, indicating that the sweet-heat flavor has evolved from a trend to a staple.\n\nFrom Burger King's \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" collab to McDonald's retro-inspired Happy Meal toys, chains across the board leaned into nostalgia in 2025 — and the trend isn't going anywhere.\n\nBeyond obvious plays, like Taco Bell's \"Decades Y2K\" menu, chains are leaning into menu items that simply evoke a nostalgic or childhood feeling of simpler times, such as chicken tenders.\n\nTechnomic's Lizzy Freier told Restaurant Business that chicken tenders are surging across foodservice because they hit multiple consumer sweet spots at once: They're familiar, nostalgic, affordable, and appeal to both kids and adults, while new dipping sauces help keep the format feeling fresh.\n\nAs we enter the new year, other nostalgic foods like milkshakes and sweet desserts could see similar rises in popularity.",

    "description": "Noodle dish is nation’s favourite comfort food and source of civic pride – but it has health risks",
    "fullText": "Noodle dish is nation’s favourite comfort food and source of civic pride – but it has health risks\n\nThe road to ramen paradise ends in the unlikeliest of places. At Men Endo, located in a suburban street, next to a school and a low-rise apartment block, bowls of noodles disappear in a flurry of slurps, gulps and hurried but heartfelt exchanges of appreciation between customer and chef.\n\nOn a cold afternoon in Yamagata, a city in Japan’s northeast, the wait for a seat at Men Endo’s counter is mercifully short. Inside the door, a ticket dispenser lists myriad options, from regular shoyu (soy sauce) ramen – in small, medium or large portions – to maji soba, a soupless symphony of toppings, sauce and noodles that diners are invited to mix together with their chopsticks, along with a spoonful of spicy miso.\n\nThat Men Endo – men is from menrui, the Japanese word for noodles, and Endo is a family name – has managed to secure a loyal clientele – which today includes construction workers, couples and a solo diner from the Guardian – is no mean feat.\n\nIn Yamagata, 340km north of Tokyo, noodle fiends have around 230 establishments to choose from, with several opening their doors early for those craving comfort food.\n\n“People here don’t ask each other where they want to go for dinner, but which ramen restaurant to go to,” says Osamu Higuchi, assistant manager in Yamagata’s brand strategy section.\n\nIt is that level of dedication to eating at restaurants – as opposed to making ramen at home or grabbing a lunchtime cup of the instant variety – that has earned Yamagata, a modestly sized city of 240,000, the title of Japan’s ramen capital.\n\nThe accolade is a source of pride, its current reign the result of an aggressive campaign to outperform its closest rival, Niigata, which shocked the ramen world by taking the title in 2021.\n\nLast year, Yamagata’s households each spent an average of ¥22,389 [£106] on ramen – well ahead of second-placed Niigata on ¥16,292, according to the internal affairs ministry, which will soon announce the winner for 2025. Only the annual ranking for gyoza consumption generates similar levels of anticipation. That title currently belongs to Hamamatsu in central Japan.\n\n“When Niigata won it was a huge shock,” says Higuchi. “Eating ramen is a big part of daily life here … to be honest it hurt our feelings.”\n\nBut the city’s appetite for ramen has its drawbacks. Frequent consumption can increase health risks, mainly due to the soup’s high salt content, according to a study of almost 7,000 people aged 40 and over led by Yamagata University. People who have the dish three or more times a week have a mortality risk 1.52 times higher than those who eat it once or twice a week, according to the four-year study published in October in the Journal of Nutrition, Health and Aging.\n\nThe experts added, however, that the statistics did not mean regular consumption was a “definite danger”, given that those most at risk possibly indulged in other habits “common among frequent ramen” eaters, such as excessive overall salt intake, drinking and smoking.\n\n“I’ve been trying not to drink all of the soup, but it’s very moreish, and the chefs go to a lot of effort to make it so it feels rude to leave any,” says Higuchi who, after consulting a smartphone app, announces he has polished off 225 bowls of ramen so far this year. “That said, households here spend an average of about ¥2,000 a month on ramen … it’s not that much when you think about it.”\n\nHealth risks aside, no Japanese dish commands as much loyalty, or generates as much discussion, as ramen. Popularised in Japan after the second world war – thanks to returning soldiers who fondly recalled how it had sustained them in Japanese-occupied China – it became a symbol of recovery and resilience.\n\nRamen critic Rikiya Yamaji believes Yamagata has perfected the art of adapting what was originally a Chinese dish to suit the Japanese palate. “Ramen has been around in Japan since the Meiji era [1868-1912], but became particularly popular when it was served at food stalls after the war,” said Yamaji, who gets through 30 bowls a month and has been known to visit several ramen shops a day.\n\n“A distinctive feature of Japanese food culture is its ability to ‘localise’ dishes introduced from overseas … curry rice is a good example. In the same way, ramen has evolved into new food culture with a uniquely Japanese approach, like Tex-Mex cuisine in the US. It used to be considered cheap and filling, and it’s still convenient and inexpensive, but these days there is more emphasis on quality and fusion ingredients.”\n\nThe noodle dish with humble origins is now the yardstick by which Japan’s regions measure their culinary caché, triggering fierce rivalries and competing claims to have achieved the perfect marriage of soup, noodles and toppings. Varieties range from miso ramen in the far north, to those sitting in a pale but pungent pork-based broth in the deep south.\n\nThe roots of Yamagata’s obsession lie in the aftermath of the 1923 Great Kantō Earthquake, which killed more than 100,000 people in the Tokyo area. Ramen chefs who fled the destroyed capital to work at soba restaurants in Yamagata shared their ramen-making skills and found a population with an appetite for steaming hot noodles to get them through the city’s bitterly cold winters. Households would order ramen, rather than trays of sushi, to serve to guests – a custom that gave children an early introduction to a dish they continued to eat into adulthood.\n\nAfter it ceded its title to Niigata a few years ago, ramen shop owners and officials in Yamagata teamed up to create an organisation dedicated to re-establishing the city as Japan’s “ramen kingdom”.\n\nHiguchi is confident Yamagata will retain the title when the government announces the 2025 results in early February. “If our ramen businesses do well, then so does the local economy – farmers and soy sauce manufacturers, even the companies that produce hot towels for restaurants,” he says. “I don’t think it’s going too far to say that Yamagata is ramen.”",

    "title": "This Radar-Equipped Stove Shutoff Is One of the Most Practical Things I Saw at CES",
    "description": "The iGuardStove keeps seniors safe in the kitchen by reducing the chance of cooking fires.",
    "fullText": "Radar-based sensors seem to be having a moment at CES, especially in tech meant for people to keep tabs on their aging family members. One product in particular caught my eye because it’s focused on a single important function—preventing kitchen fires caused by a person wandering away from the stove.\n\niGuardStove is essentially a smart shutoff for a stove or cooktop. Its new, radar-equipped version costs $399 and can work on gas or electric stoves. (For gas, you’ll need to have a plumber install a shutoff valve.) If you leave the kitchen while cooking, a five-minute timer starts. If you don’t return by the time it goes off, the device either cuts the power to your electric stove, or shuts off the supply line to your gas stove. It can also notify a caregiver that a shutoff event occurred.\n\nA big theme in smart tech this year is aging-in-place. Most older adults would prefer to live at home as long as they can, but health challenges can make that difficult. When it comes to cooking or other activities that require a sharp mind, mental health issues like dementia come into play, as do medications that can have cognitive side effects. With all that in mind, caregivers often worry about a parent leaving the kitchen while cooking, forgetting that the stove is on.\n\nThe National Fire Protection Association reports that cooking fires are the top cause of home fires, the top cause of fire-related injuries, and the number three cause of fire-related deaths. Unattended cooking equipment causes half of those deaths. Older adults are overrepresented as fire casualties compared to younger and middle-aged people.\n\nThe device has a five-minute timer, specifically, because that was a safety margin the company developed with safety organization UL, chief marketing officer Jon Landers told me. You can also override the five-minute timer if you’re roasting a turkey or preparing a slow-simmered sauce. In this case you tell the device how long the food is expected to cook, and it lets this cook time complete before resetting to the usual five-minute timer behavior.\n\nA previous version of the iGuardStove used motion detectors, but if you’ve ever worked in an office that had lights on motion sensors, you know why that wasn’t a great solution: sit still at a table for too long, and the lights go off. The older version of the device could potentially shut off while you're just waiting for your dinner to cook, and could be triggered by motion from pets. Radar solves those problems, since it can more accurately identify when a person is in the room.\n\nI’ve been seeing radar in a number of aging-in-place products at CES this year. The Silver Shield from PontoSense uses radar to monitor a person’s presence and movement in a room, reporting movement and potential falls to a caregiver’s app. Luna, a conversation and reminder device from Cairns Health, includes radar that can monitor heart rate and breathing (even through blankets!) when positioned near a person’s bed. The iGuardStove has some monitoring features in common with those devices, but it stays focused on its main task of ensuring stoves aren’t left running unattended.\n\nRadar can “see” a lot, but it doesn’t feel quite as privacy-invading as a camera. Having a device in the kitchen is also a bit less intrusive than in a bedroom, for those who would feel creeped out knowing that a tech device is watching them sleep.\n\nBesides shutting off the stove, the iGuardStove can report to a caregiver (via an app, of course) things like what time each day a person first enters the kitchen. It can catch nighttime wandering if the person visits the kitchen at night; it can also send an alert if the person doesn’t seem to be up and active at their usual time. For example, if your mom usually makes coffee around 9:00 every morning, you can ask the app to notify you if the kitchen is still empty at 10:00.\n\nBesides shutting off the stove and reporting on the presence of a person in the kitchen, the iGuardStove has a few other clever features. The version of the device made for gas stoves can detect unburned gas, in case somebody left it on without a burner running.\n\nThe device can also be configured to keep the stove from being turned on by pets or children, or it can be locked to not allow cooking during certain hours or days (say, at night). The app can also alert a caregiver if temperatures get too hot or cold, prompting them to check in if a heat wave or a cold snap is bad enough to affect indoor temperatures.\n\nWhile a lot of products I’ve seen at CES are speculative or hopeful in their use cases—I often find myself asking “who would actually use this?”—the iGuardStove seems thoughtfully designed and has a concrete use case and benefit. I was impressed! The new device is expected to ship later this year.",

    "fullText": "No one does fast food quite like McDonald’s. After all, that signature smell of fresh french fries wafting through the car after a trip to the drive through is hard to compare to anything else. Whether you’re going for a burger, nuggets or even just a sip of their crispy Coke, you can’t really go wrong with the fast food giant—unless you’re ordering the McRib. In December, a lawsuit was filed against McDonald’s by four individuals who claim the restaurant has been lying to customers regarding the meat that makes up this menu item. Here, read all there is to know about the McDonald’s class-action lawsuit.\n\nWhen you hear the name “McRib,” it’s fair to assume that what you’re consuming is going to be rib meat—but according to the plaintiffs behind this lawsuit, McDonald’s has been deceiving its customers. “Despite its name and distinctive shape—its meat patty has been deliberately crafted to resemble a rack of pork ribs—the McRib does not contain any actual pork rib meat at all,” claims the lawsuit. “Instead, its meat patty is reconstructed using ground-up portions of lower-grade pork products such as inter alia, pork shoulder, heart, tripe and scalded stomach.”\n\nWhile the sandwich is called the McRib, the McDonald’s website doesn't explicitly say the menu item contains rib meat. Instead, among the ingredients listed for the McRib is a McRib Pork Patty, alongside McRib sauce, pickles and onions on a homestyle bun. “The McRib starts with seasoned boneless pork dipped in a tangy BBQ sauce, topped with slivered onions and tangy pickles, all served on a toasted homestyle bun,” states their website.\n\nThe individuals behind the lawsuit argue that including the word “rib” in the item’s name indicates that the sandwich consists of “at least some meaningful quantity of actual pork rib meat.”\n\nThe current McDonald’s class-action McRib lawsuit  is not the first lawsuit the fast food giant has dealt with, but they recently responded to the claims at hand. “This lawsuit distorts the facts and many of the claims are inaccurate,” they told NBC Chicago. \"Food quality and safety are at the heart of everything we do—that’s why we’re committed to using real, quality ingredients across our entire menu. Our fan-favorite McRib sandwich is made with 100% pork sourced from farmers and suppliers across the US. We’ve always been transparent about our ingredients so guests can make the right choice for them.”\n\nAt this point in time, the people behind the lawsuit are asking that those who have purchased a McRib within the last four years receive class certification and later, “compensatory damages, restitution, and injunctive relief.” Whether you're a McRib fan or not, staying informed about what's in your food helps you make the best choices for you and your family. And if you're craving that tangy BBQ flavor? Now you know exactly what you're getting.\n\nLooking for more trending stories?

    "fullText": "Dozens, maybe hundreds of restaurants have tried to copy the Chipotle model of offering customized meals made live in front of customers by workers on a \"make line.\" In theory, it's a simple way to offer fresh food that's customizable based on what the customer wants.\n\nThe problem is that the devil is in the details. Chipotle has figured out how to deliver a product customers want in an efficient and cost-effective style.\n\nIn fact, the Mexican chain has actually created a fast-food product that consumers value enough to pay more for it than what they typically spend.\n\nHigher price than fast food: A Chipotle burrito or bowl averages $12 to $14, compared with $7 to $11 for a McDonald’s or Taco Bell combo, according to Fox9.\n\nCompetitive in fast casual: Chipotle meals are about 30 to 40% cheaper than premium fast-casual rivals like Sweetgreen or Cava, according to Restaurant Dive.\n\nCost drivers: Prices reflect fresh ingredients, sustainable sourcing, labor, and generous portion sizes, which differentiate it from typical fast-food operations, reported Meals By Andy.\n\nEssentially, the Mexican chain has built something that's better than fast food without the expense of being a traditional sit-down fast-casual restaurant with table service.\n\n\"Chipotle Mexican Grill is a category-defining fast casual brand that turns a focused menu and made-to-order assembly line into speed, personalization, and consistent quality. Its business model pairs culinary credibility with operational discipline, using a streamlined kitchen and limited SKUs to drive high throughput and attractive unit economics,\" according to Latterly.com.\n\n\"The result is a differentiated value proposition that blends premium ingredients, transparent preparation, and convenience in restaurant and through digital pickup and delivery.\"\n\nIt's easy to see why restaurant operators would want to copy that model, but the struggles of one chain, Genghis Grill, show exactly how hard it is to duplicate what Chipotle created.\n\nWhen Genghis Grill launched in 1998, it was a variation on the traditional Mongolian BBQ Grill model. It was a build-your-own-bowl model using a per-bowl rather than all-you-can-eat format.\n\nCustomers select raw ingredients, proteins, vegetables, sauces, noodles, and spice from the Fresh Bar.\n\nThey place everything into a large bowl.\n\nThe bowl is then handed to a chef at the grill, who stir-fries the ingredients on a large circular flat-top grill in front of the customer.\n\nI visited the chain for lunch in a Texas mall back in the 2010s and liked that I could customize my bowl, while not having to pay an all-you-can-eat price. At dinner, I may have opted for an AYCE version of the same concept, but getting exactly what I wanted at an affordable price made for an excellent lunch offering.",

    "description": "As a registered dietitian who follows the Mediterranean diet but dislikes cooking, I use low-effort Trader Joe's staples to make easy meals or snacks.",
    "fullText": "When I tell people I've been a registered dietitian for more than 20 years, the assumption is that I love to eat nutritious foods and cook them myself.\n\nI try to mostly eat balanced and nutrient-dense meals that follow the Mediterranean diet — which focuses on consuming lots of whole grains and produce while limiting red meats and processed foods — but I don't enjoy spending time planning, cooking, and cleaning.\n\nThankfully, Trader Joe's has some gems that help me feed my entire family (including a picky child).\n\nHere are some of my must-buy items that I use to help create healthy and easy meals without spending too much time in the kitchen.\n\nEditor's Note: Product price and availability may vary.\n\nEnvy apples can be added to salads, \"girl dinners,\" or lunchboxes for an extra crunch, a boost of fiber, and balanced sweetness.\n\nThey're appealing because their insides tend to stay whiter longer, allowing for slicing or chopping without worrying too much about being stuck with discolored fruit.\n\nSalmon from Norway is known for its pure taste, beautiful color, and firm flesh. Much of that is due to its balanced fat content and firm texture.\n\nIt's also nutrient-dense, providing essentials such as omega-3; vitamins D, B12, and A; and selenium. Plus, it's incredibly easy to cook, especially if I remember to marinate it the night before.\n\nI don't follow a vegan diet, but that doesn't stop me from purchasing this plant-based pesto from Trader Joe's to use on pasta dishes, sandwiches, or as a dip.\n\nContaining kale, cashew, and basil, this pesto is also my secret ingredient in killer grilled-cheese sandwiches.\n\nIf it were socially acceptable to drink Trader Joe's vegan creamy dill dressing with a straw, I'd do it. I love that it's free from fillers or emulsifiers, and the flavor is incredibly satisfying.\n\nThe obvious way to enjoy this dressing is on top of a salad. However, I also use it as a saucy addition to chicken or fish meals, an ingredient in grain-based dishes, and a condiment on sandwiches.\n\nNot loving to cook also means not loving to prep snacks. However, because I lead an active lifestyle, I know I need to fuel myself with nutrients such as sustainable carbohydrates before starting a workout.\n\nClif Bars are crafted with a blend of plant-based protein, fat, and carbohydrates. They're my favorite pre-workout snack that requires zero effort in the kitchen.\n\nThis frozen blend of blueberries, bananas, strawberries, dragon fruit, spinach, and kale makes smoothie-making so easy.\n\nThere's no chopping or prepping required when I'm in the mood for a breakfast smoothie — I simply toss some of this into a blender with milk.\n\nVeggies are a must at dinnertime in my house. Having prewashed and cut veggie and produce kits, such as the Trader Joe's asparagus sauté with mushrooms and onions, makes cooking dinner a breeze.\n\nSimply open the package and sauté everything in some extra-virgin olive oil.\n\nWhole grains can be both nutritious and filling. For those who don't like spending too much time in the kitchen, cooking them can be a tedious task.\n\nPrecooked frozen grains, such as Trader Joe's bulgur pilaf with squash and feta, only need to be heated through. Plus, this one is made with butternut squash, and I like the boost of veggies in every bite.\n\nTrader Joe's frozen precooked cauliflower rice is a perfect base for a low-carb meal. I just add a protein to make it a more complete dish.\n\nFor people who don't love cauliflower rice — but tolerate it because they want to include more veggies in their diet (such as my husband) — mixing this dish with some regular rice can offer the best of both worlds.\n\nPrecooked and shelled hard-boiled eggs make for an easy breakfast protein, salad topping, or sandwich addition.\n\nYes, even dietitians want to have pizza night once in a while.\n\nTrader Joe's frozen Tarte au Brie et aux Tomates satisfies the fiercest pizza craving. Plus, heating it up takes less time than we'd spend waiting for a pie to be delivered from the local pizzeria.\n\nI enjoy one serving as a main course, accompanied by a side salad, for a complete meal.\n\nClick to keep reading Trader Joe's diaries like this one.\n\nThis story was originally published on September 25, 2023, and most recently updated on January 5, 2025.",

    "fullText": "I don't have a cat, but I do have a dog, and my dog can be a picky eater. After months of trial and error, the only way we could get him to consistently eat breakfast and dinner was with wet food. There is no scenario in which I or someone watching my dog can outsource the task of feeding him, but that's not the case for cat owners. I know that cats sometimes stay home alone for extended periods of time, where an automatic food dispenser becomes essential. I can only imagine, then, that cat owners who, like me, feed their pet wet food, now have a challenge: Someone has to be there to feed the cat.\n\nThat's what intrigues me about Petkit's Yumshare Daily Feast, an automated cat feeder that specifically works with wet food. I covered the Yumshare briefly when Petkit first announced it last week, but I got some hands-on time with the product today on the CES show floor. And while the device I saw isn't going to market just yet, I was intrigued.\n\nThe concept itself is pretty simple, but a bit more complex in execution. As you might expect, the feeder distributes portions of food for your cat to eat when you're not available—only here, that food is wet, not dry. To achieve this, Petkit outfitted the Yumshare with a chamber that can hold up to seven pouches of wet food at once. These pouches are designed for the Yumshare alone: Right now, the only company making pouches is Food Chain, which uses Petkit's proprietary design to fit the Yumshare, but it's possible more companies more jump on board in the future.\n\nWhen the Yumshare first opens one of these pouches, it sets a timer: After 48 hours, the pouch is discarded. In the meantime, the machine can automatically dole out portions set by the user, into a cup, which is stored in a separate chamber in the device. Once the portion is distributed, the pouch is sealed until the next portion is needed. The machine also uses UVC ultraviolet light to sanitize the package, with the goal of eliminating bacteria.\n\nThe automation extends to the portion of wet food itself, as well. Whether your cat eats all of the food, some of the food, or none of the food, the Yumshare can discard what's left when it detects it's time to do so. That might be the AI camera identifying that the food has dried up, or an internal clock recognizing that too much time has passed for the food to be safe to eat. Either way, the food drops into a waste compartment, which can hold up to 15 cups at once. The stand remains empty until it's time to hand out another portion of food.\n\nHow large or small each portion is, as well as how often portions are distributed, is up to you. Petkit showed me a mockup of the Yumshare's app, which lets you customize this feeding schedule. The app will also tell you how many portions have been distributed, and how many are left in the chamber. You can also take a look at a live video feed of your cat, via the 4K camera embedded in the device, or view a clip history of your cat's feeding habits.\n\nMy only question is the lack of refrigeration: Petkit says that there is no need for it, since the pouches are all sealed until use, closed in between portions, and the chamber uses ultraviolet light to sterilize for bacteria. But I'd want to confirm there are no health risks to keeping an opened pouch unrefrigerated for up to two full days, even with that UVC light. Assuming that's true, I'm quite impressed with this prototype. If I were a cat owner that frequently needed to leave my pet alone at breakfast and dinner, this is something I'd have my eye on.",

This would also affect what Henry would be able to wear.\nThe version of Kingdom Come 2 that launched in February 2025 allows players to put on any piece of clothing they find.

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ethan Tan, a 24-year-old prawn noodle hawker from Singapore. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've always loved cooking with my mother and watching cooking videos. It took me three painful years studying computer engineering and one corporate internship to decide hawker life was the way to go.\n\nMy parents wanted me to learn something traditional and study engineering or become a doctor.\n\nSo I thought, \"I like playing computer games, so let's pursue computer engineering.\" I didn't think much about it, and I didn't do much research.\n\nWhen the course started, I hated it. I didn't get coding at all. Examinations were hard for me, and I just suffered through them.\n\nThe point where I really felt like this wasn't the right path for me was when I got caught cheating during an exam. I managed to lie to the examiner and pretend I wasn't cheating.\n\nBut that made me realize something: If I have to resort to cheating, this is really not what I want to do.\n\nI did an internship at Accenture. It was the same thing every day: sitting at the same table from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., queuing for lunch at a crowded food court, and taking the train home.\n\nThe only comfort was sleeping in the office chair. I slept there every day for two hours. It was very boring.\n\nWith a corporate job out of the question, I looked for other career paths.\n\nAfter graduating and completing my military service, I joined my father at his seafood hawker stall.\n\nAfter about three years of managing the stall, and a short stint at the kitchens in The American Club in Singapore for some restaurant experience, I told my dad I wanted to build something of my own.\n\nIn August 2024, I opened Udang Udang, a halal prawn noodle stall right beside my father's stall in Singapore's northern Woodlands neighborhood. I used my grandmother's recipes and a recipe I learned from a streetside vendor I met in Penang, Malaysia.\n\nBefore I hired staff, it was rough. I got in early in the mornings to fry up 40 kilograms of prawn heads to make the broth. It needs to boil for six hours, and in Singapore's heat, that's no joke.\n\nBut now, more than a year on, business is faring well. I sell an average of 600 bowls of noodles daily, earning about 3,000 Singapore dollars, or about $2,300, in sales every day. I manage both my dad's stall and my own.\n\nMy plan is now to expand to more outlets around Singapore, with one new store every year.\n\nIt was tough working with my dad at the start. We fought almost every day for the first two years, and many tables were slammed in frustration.\n\nWe don't see eye to eye on many things. I tried to convince him to spend more money on marketing, including hiring influencers to try our food and creating promotional videos, but he prefers for the word to spread organically. We feel differently about how we price our products as well.\n\nIt's been challenging to learn how to work together. But we've nailed it down now, learning how to separate life and work, and talking through our differences.\n\nAt work, we're not father and son. We can fight and argue all we want. But when we get back home, I'm still his beloved son.",
