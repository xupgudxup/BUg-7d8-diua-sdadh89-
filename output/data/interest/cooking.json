    "fullText": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Rains drenched Gaza’s tent camps and dropping temperatures chilled Palestinians huddling inside them Thursday as winter storm Byron descended on the war-battered territory, showing how two months of a ceasefire have failed to sufficiently address the spiraling humanitarian crisis there.\n\nFamilies found their possessions and food supplies soaked inside their tents. Children’s sandaled feet disappeared under opaque brown water that flooded the camps, running knee deep in some places. Dirt roads turned to mud. Piles of garbage and sewage cascaded like waterfalls.\n\n“We have been drowned. I don’t have clothes to wear and we have no mattresses left,” said Um Salman Abu Qenas, a displaced mother in a Khan Younis tent camp. She said that her family couldn't sleep the night before, because of the water in the tent.\n\nAid groups say not enough shelter materials are getting into Gaza during the truce. Figures recently released by Israel's military suggest it hasn't met the ceasefire stipulation of allowing 600 trucks of aid into Gaza a day, though Israel disputes that finding.\n\n“Cold, overcrowded, and unsanitary environments heighten the risk of illness and infection,” the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said on X. “This suffering could be prevented by unhindered humanitarian aid, including medical support and proper shelter.\"\n\nSabreen Qudeeh, also in the Khan Younis camp, in a squalid area known as Muwasi, said that her family woke up to rain leaking from their tent's ceiling and water from the street soaking their mattresses.\n\n“My little daughters were screaming,” she said.\n\nAhmad Abu Taha, also living in the camp, said there wasn't a tent that escaped the flooding. “Conditions are very bad, we have old people, displaced, and sick people inside this camp,” he said.\n\nFloods in south-central Israel trapped more than a dozen people in their cars, according to Hebrew media. Israel's rescue services, MDA, said that two young girls were slightly injured when a tree fell on their school.\n\nThe contrasting scenes with Gaza made clear how profoundly the Israel-Hamas war had damaged the territory, destroying the majority of homes. Gaza’s population of around 2 million is almost entirely displaced, and most people live in vast tent camps stretching along the coast, or set up among the shells of damaged buildings without adequate flooding infrastructure and with cesspits dug near tents as toilets.\n\nAt least three buildings in Gaza City already damaged by Israeli bombardment during the war partially collapsed under the rain, Palestinian Civil Defense said. It warned people not to stay inside damaged buildings, saying they too could fall down on top of them.\n\nThe agency also said that since the storm began, they have received more than 2,500 distress calls from people across Gaza whose tents and shelters were damaged.\n\nWith buckets and mops, Palestinians laboriously scooped water out of their tents.\n\nAliaa Bahtiti said her 8-year-old son \"was soaked overnight, and in the morning he had turned blue, sleeping on water.” Her tent floor had an inch of water on it “We cannot buy food, covers, towels, or sheets to sleep on.”\n\nBaraka Bhar was caring for her 3-month-old twins inside her tent as the rain poured outside. One of the twins has hydrocephalus, a build-up of fluids in the brain.\n\n“Our tents are worn out ... and they leak rain water,” she said. “We should not lose our children this winter.”\n\nAid groups say that Israel isn't allowing enough aid into Gaza to begin rebuilding the territory after years of war.\n\nUnder the agreement, Israel agreed to comply with aid stipulations from an earlier January truce, which specified that it allow 600 trucks of aid each day into Gaza, It maintains it's doing so, but The Associated Press found that some of its own figures call that into question.\n\nThe January truce also specified that Israel let in a number of caravans and tents. No caravans have yet entered Gaza during the ceasefire, said Tania Hary, executive director of Gisha, an Israeli group advocating for Palestinians’ right to freedom of movement.\n\nThe Israeli military body in charge of coordinating aid to Gaza, called COGAT, said on Dec. 9 it had “lately\" let 260,000 tents and tarpaulins into Gaza and more than 1,500 trucks of blankets and warm clothing.\n\nShelter Cluster, an international coalition of aid providers led by the Norwegian Refugee Council, sets the number lower. It says the U.N. and international nongovernmental organizations have gotten 15,590 tents into Gaza since the truce began, and other countries have sent about 48,000. Many of the tents aren't properly insulated, it says.\n\nAmjad al-Shawa, Gaza chief of the Palestinian NGO Network, told Al Jazeera on Thursday that only a fraction of the 300,000 tents needed had entered Gaza. He said that Palestinians were in dire need of warmer winter clothes and accused Israel of blocking the entry of water pumps to help clear flooded shelters..\n\n\"All international sides should take the responsibility regarding conditions in Gaza,” he said. “There is real danger for people in Gaza at all levels.”\n\nKhaled Mashaal, a Hamas leader, said in an interview with Al Jazeera that Gaza needs the rehabilitation of hospitals, the entry of heavy machinery to remove rubble, and the opening of the Rafah crossing — which remains closed after Israel said last week it would shortly open.\n\nCOGAT didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the claims that Israel wasn’t allowing water pumps or heavy machinery into Gaza\n\nAmnesty accuses Hamas of crimes against humanity\n\nAmnesty International said in a report released Thursday that Hamas and other militant groups committed crimes against humanity in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel that triggered the war in Gaza.\n\nIn the 173-page report, Amnesty pointed to what it found to be widespread and systematic killing of civilians in the attack, as well as torture, hostage-taking and sexual abuse.\n\nIn the attack, Hamas fighters and other militants rampaged through southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking around 250 others hostage. Israel's campaign in Gaza has since killed more than 70,300 Palestinians, roughly half of them women and children, according to the territory’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and civilians in its count. Last year, Amnesty accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, a charge Israel denied.\n\nAmnesty said it conducted interviews with 70 people, including 17 survivors of the attack and family members of some of those killed. It also reviewed hundreds of open-source videos and photos from the day of the attack.\n\nContrary to Hamas claims it was targeting the military, it said, the attack was intentionally “directed against a civilian population” and met international law standards for crimes against humanity.\n\nIt said sexual assaults were also committed, though it said it could not reach a conclusion on their “scope or scale.” It interviewed one man who testified he was raped by armed men at the Nova music festival, as well as a therapist who said she provided intensive treatment to three other survivors of rape.\n\nHamas condemned the report, saying it “echoed false claims” by Israel.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister spokesperson Oren Marmorstein derided the report in a posting on X, saying it took more than two years for Amnesty to address the attack “and even now its report falls far short of reflecting the full scope of Hamas’s horrific atrocities.”",

    "description": "At least four provinces will be using the sales of their American liquor to fund food banks and charities.",
    "fullText": "Canada is coming up with ways to put its stockpiled American liquor to good use.\n\nSeveral provinces in the country halted imports of US booze and removed it from store shelves in March in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nNow, at least four provinces are planning to sell the remaining inventory and donate proceeds to food banks.\n\nCanada's far eastern province, Prince Edward Island, told Business Insider that its government will put its stock of American booze, which it had pulled off the shelves, back in stores starting on December 11.\n\nA representative for the province's finance department said the government anticipates profits of $600,000 Canadian dollars, or about $434,000, from the sale. The proceeds will be distributed to food banks across the island. The province says it does not intend to place any further orders for American alcohol.\n\nThe finance office of Newfoundland and Labrador told Business Insider it had made an upfront payment of $500,000 on Tuesday to 60 provincial food banks before the sales of any liquors, a move that will help more than 15,400 people. After the liquor is sold, more donations will go to the food banks for a total sum of up to $1 million.\n\nManitoba and Nova Scotia have similar plans.\n\nManitoba said it will sell its inventory through private retailers and restaurants, with the estimated $500,000 in net revenue going to food banks, holiday charities, children's organizations, and an advocacy group for First Nations.\n\nAs for Nova Scotia, the province is making a $4 million upfront payment to groups that provide food access, and the money will be recouped when the $14 million worth of liquor is eventually sold.\n\n\"We will not be ordering any more from the United States once this inventory is gone,\" the province's premier, Tim Houston, said in a statement. \"But Nova Scotians have already paid for this product.\"\n\nHe added, \"We don't want it to go to waste. That's why we're selling it and using the proceeds to help those in need.\"\n\nIn Canada, the sale of alcohol is mainly controlled by provincial governments, each of which establishes a board to oversee the matter. Only Alberta has a completely privatized alcohol retail system, while Saskatchewan has a partially privatized system.\n\nCanada mainly imports whiskey and bourbon, alongside beer and other spirits, from the US.\n\nA spokesperson for Ontario's finance ministry told Business Insider that the province had no plans to put the booze on store shelves soon.\n\n\"US alcohol will remain off shelves and is being held in storage until further notice,\" said the spokesperson. \"We are currently exploring options for the products.\"\n\nOntario did not disclose how much inventory it still has, but the province said the inventory it had pulled off the shelves in March was worth around C$80 million.\n\nA government representative from the Northwest Territories and a spokesperson of the British Columbia Liquor Distribution Branch both told Business Insider that they ceased US liquor imports in March, but will continue selling the stockpiled products until they are depleted.\n\nA Yukon government cabinet representative said Yukon has the same plan.\n\nHowever, the mountainous province of Alberta continues to import and sell American booze.\n\n\"In June this year, Alberta lifted restrictions on the purchase of US alcohol from American companies, signalling a renewed commitment to open and fair trade with our largest partner,\" a spokesperson of Service Alberta and Red Tape Reduction told Business Insider.\n\nThe matter of US booze has been fueling the trade tension between the two neighbors.\n\nThe animosity started when Trump imposed a 25% tariff on Canada in March and commented that Canada should become a state of the US.\n\nDespite later walking back some of his broader tariffs and upholding a previous agreement that ensured most goods remain tariff-free, Trump's moves have drawn the ire of Canadians, who have canceled travel plans and boycotted American goods in stores.\n\nAccording to the Distilled Spirits Council, US spirits exports to Canada plummeted 85% in the second quarter of 2025, falling below $10 million in export value.\n\n\"We hope both the US and Canada can address their respective concerns,\" said Chris Swonger, the CEO of the council. \"And that our products can return to Canadian retail shelves as soon as possible.\"\n\nIn March, Kentucky's bourbon makers said Canada's ban on American alcohol would hurt them.\n\nEric Gregory, the president of the Kentucky Distillers' Association, said in March that retaliatory tariffs would have \"far-reaching consequences across Kentucky, home to 95% of the world's bourbon.\"",

    "title": "I lived in Europe for almost a decade. Here are the 6 cities you should visit during the holiday season.",
    "description": "When I lived in Europe, I visited a variety of Christmas markets. I enjoyed the scenery, food, and trinkets at markets in Vienna, Geneva, and Bruges.",
    "fullText": "I've always been enchanted by the idea of European Christmas markets. Complete with rosy glowing lights, steaming mulled wine, and stalls dripping with handmade crafts, they seemed like something out of a storybook.\n\nSo, when I moved to Budapest in 2017 and was suddenly just a quick flight or train away from many of the continent's most famous markets, I knew I had to take advantage of the opportunity.\n\nHere are six of my favorite cities that I think should be at the top of your list if you're planning to visit Europe's Christmas markets this holiday season.\n\nOf course, I have to start with Budapest. The city is famous for its grand palaces, and come winter, it's dotted with incredible Christmas markets.\n\nOne of my favorites is the Advent Basilica Market, which pulls you in like a magnet with colorful stalls, a towering Christmas tree, and a light show every 30 minutes — all in front of St. Stephen's Basilica.\n\nThe market is filled with so many amazing scents, from the lavender goods and crafts made on the peninsula of Tihany to the paprika Hungary is famous for — it's even in soap.\n\nFor a truly local experience, hop across the river to ice skate at the Advent in Óbuda market, located about 20 minutes from the Basilica on public transport.\n\nWhile you're in the city, I recommend trying kürtőskalács, which you can watch vendors make at all of the major markets.\n\nTranslated as \"chimney cake,\" this spiral of dough is cooked over hot coals before being rolled in toppings, such as sugar, cocoa, or cinnamon (to name a few). When it's fresh off the coals, steam rises from the center of the pastry, resembling a smoking chimney.\n\nI first fell in love with Danish Christmas markets when I studied in Copenhagen for a semester, delighted by how they brought warmth to the darkness of Scandinavian winters.\n\nThe Nyhavn Christmas Market is located on the banks of the canal, with the colorfully painted buildings decorated with lights and julehjerter (Christmas hearts).\n\nI loved that the market was in one of Copenhagen's most iconic areas — it felt like celebrating Christmas in a postcard.\n\nFor a unique holiday experience, visit Tivoli Gardens, the second-oldest amusement park in the world. The already whimsical theme park is covered in Christmas decorations this time of year, plus there's ice skating and a traditional market for visitors to explore.\n\nDon't forget to stop for a ride or two, and try Æbleskiver from one of the market stands. These fluffy, pancake-like balls, dusted in powdered sugar, are so easy to eat, especially with a side of gløgg (mulled wine) to keep you warm.\n\nSituated on the shores of Lake Geneva is the Christmas market Noël au Quai. To get a great view of the Jet d'Eau (an iconic fountain in the lake), hop onto the market's Ferris wheel, then stroll between chalets filled with crafts, gifts, and food.\n\nOne thing I love about Swiss Christmas market food is the dedication to cheese. As soon as I saw a stall selling Chäsbängel — a hollowed-out baguette filled with melted cheese — I knew I had to have it.\n\nI also enjoyed raclette, another melted cheese that pairs well with potatoes, pickles, and more, and absolutely hits the spot on a cold winter's day.\n\nOh, and it's also a great opportunity to try famous Swiss chocolate.\n\nVienna is home to some of the most storied Christmas markets in Europe.\n\nMy favorite — and arguably the city's most famous — is the sprawling market at the Rathausplatz (City Hall), which has a whimsical carousel and towering displays of keepsake ornaments.\n\nI also suggest stopping by Stephansplatz Market, located in the city center, wrapping around the famous St. Stephen's Cathedral.\n\nIt's so cool to stand around the small tables in the shadow of such a Gothic masterpiece, keeping your hands warm by wrapping them around a mug of glühwein (mulled wine). Plus, for a few extra Euros, you can buy a keepsake mug to take home with you.\n\nLuckily, with just a 20-minute train ride between Bruges and Ghent, it's easy to visit both cities' markets in a day. Plus, both are about an hour from Brussels, too, making them good options for a day trip from the capital.\n\nThe red brick building facades and cobblestone streets of Bruges make the city look like something straight from a fairytale.\n\nBeyond the official markets, I loved window shopping among the seemingly endless chocolate shops, dressed with holiday decor and piles of handmade bonbons.\n\nAnd in Ghent, the markets are scattered throughout the small city, offering visitors ample opportunity to stroll around and admire the medieval architecture all dressed up for the festive season.\n\nWhile you're at the markets, make sure to grab a cone of piping-hot, crispy frites (fries) and a side of rich Belgian mayonnaise for dipping.",

    "fullText": "The US Food and Drug Administration is looking into whether deaths “across multiple age groups” have been related to Covid-19 vaccines, a spokesperson said Tuesday, weeks after a senior agency official claimed — without offering evidence – that Covid-19 vaccinations resulted in the deaths of 10 children.\n\nAndrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services, said the FDA is conducting “a thorough investigation” but declined to offer details on what data sources are being used and what potential changes, if any, are being considered to Covid vaccine approval or marketing.\n\nDr. Vinay Prasad, the FDA’s chief medical and scientific officer and director of its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, claimed in a memo late last month that “Healthy young children who faced tremendously low risk of death were coerced, at the behest of the Biden administration, via school and work mandates, to receive a vaccine that could result in death.”\n\nPrasad did not provide details about the 10 deaths or how the FDA came to that conclusion but pointed to “an initial analysis” that examined 96 deaths and linked 10 to the Covid-19 vaccination. He also claimed that Covid “was never highly lethal for children” and that the effects of it “are comparable” to respiratory viruses for which there aren’t annual vaccines.\n\nMore than 700 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in the US since they became available in late 2020, according to the World Health Organization. The shots have been extensively tested and continually monitored for safety, and serious side effects such as anaphylaxis or myocarditis have been generally rare.\n\nFDA regulations require health care providers to report deaths after vaccination to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), even if it’s not clear that vaccination was the cause of death. Members of the general public can also submit events to the database, which federal agencies use to generate further study on vaccine safety.\n\nPrasad said that as a result of the FDA analysis, the agency will adopt a new approval process for vaccines that will require more evidence of their safety and value before they can be marketed. Among the changes would be stricter requirements for authorization of vaccines used for pregnant women and trials for pneumonia vaccines that will need to prove the shots reduce disease, instead of showing that the vaccine produces enough antibodies to fight the illness.\n\nThe agency will also “revise the annual flu vaccine framework,” Prasad said, and “will re-appraise safety and be honest in vaccine labels.”\n\nHHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has repeatedly raised doubts about the effectiveness of vaccines and previously founded the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense.\n\nAs secretary, Kennedy has slashed funding for mRNA vaccine development, replaced the members of the vaccine advisory committee at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and directed the CDC to change its website to include false claims that link autism and vaccines.\n\nCNN’s Kaanita Iyer, Adam Cancryn and Amanda Sealy contributed to this report.",

    "description": "I never thought I'd move back to my hometown, Portland, Oregon, but I did. Now, I love living here for many reasons, from the food to the community.",
    "fullText": "Portland, Oregon, isn't perfect.\n\nIt's not particularly diverse, and most restaurants close way too early for anyone under the age of 60. The \"Pacific Northwest freeze\" is a real thing: People here can be simultaneously too nice and impossible to befriend.\n\nWhen I left Portland in my early 20s to travel the world for almost a decade, I didn't think I'd ever move back. Growing up there was pretty magical, but I hated the city in the way most angsty teens hate their hometown.\n\nThen, amid the coronavirus pandemic, I booked a flight back to Portland to be near family. Five years later, I'm still here — and I can't see myself living anywhere else. Here's why.\n\nPortland is surrounded by natural beauty.\n\nLocals love to brag that you can be in the mountains or on the coast within an hour and a half — a luxury few cities can claim.\n\nBelieve it or not, you can even be in the rainforest in half an hour, surrounded by ferns and fluorescent-green moss.\n\nI regularly make the scenic drive to the Columbia River Gorge, a historic stretch dotted with tunnels and waterfalls, when I need to clear my mind. Stopping to stand at the base of a 620-foot waterfall and get misted in the face never fails to do the trick.\n\nThe natural beauty really is everywhere. On a casual walk around my neighborhood, I've found everything from fresh blackberries and wild bunnies to roaming chickens and secret gardens filled with dahlias and roses.\n\nI'm convinced Portland has more outstanding restaurants per capita than any other city.\n\nThough the city is predominantly white, my taste buds have been thrilled in recent years to see diversity reflected in Portland's rise to foodie fame.\n\nThe star of the show is Kann, a James Beard Award-winning restaurant by Gregory Gourdet, where \"Haitian cuisine meets Pacific Northwest bounty,\" and an absolutely mind-blowing plantain brioche meets my mouth.\n\nThen there's Jinju Patisserie, named the country's most outstanding bakery at the James Beard Awards earlier this year. There, two Korean-born pastry chefs whip up croissants that rival any I've had in Paris.\n\nBut award winners barely scratch the surface. My personal list of outstanding local Thai restaurants is longer than my Trader Joe's receipts.\n\nPlus, Portland is especially known for its food trucks, which is how I first tried Guyanese food (at Bake on the Run), snow-cheese Korean fried chicken (at Frybaby), and Puerto Rican-Philly fusion dishes (at Papi Sal's).\n\nI came out after leaving Oregon, and before moving back, I'd only lived in areas where the LGBTQ+ community was either small or centered on gay men.\n\nPortland is the first time I've felt included, and the queer community here is at the heart of why I chose to stay. This city's LGBTQ+ community feels refreshingly queer.\n\nMy friends and I joke that most bars in Portland are gay bars just because the local population has so many queer folks. Many popular nightlife spots regularly host LGBTQ+ events, even if they aren't specifically \"gay bars.\"\n\nOn any given weekend, I might have to choose between a \"Twilight\"-themed drag show, an LGBTQ+ storytelling event, a queer pie-eating contest, a lesbian dance party, or a trans wrestling match.\n\nBecause it rarely takes me longer than 15 minutes to get anywhere around the city, I can try to squeeze all the events in.\n\nAnd when I wake up exhausted and hungry on Sunday morning, I can join my fellow Portland gays doing what we love most — waiting in inordinately long brunch lines.\n\nIf you've got a special interest, you're bound to find a group of people here who are loudly and proudly into the same thing, no matter how niche or offbeat.\n\nCan you guess where I've made the most friends in Portland? If you said, \"a weekly '80s-themed mall walk in the city's half-abandoned Lloyd Center mall,\" you'd be right.\n\nWhen I picked up rollerskating during the pandemic, I was thrilled to learn that the city runs a \"secret roller disco\" every week in undisclosed pop-up locations like warehouse parking lots (and the same half-abandoned mall).\n\nOver the summer, I participated in a watermelon-wrestling fundraiser. In the fall, I got to take an entire four-week class about 1970s cult horror in the back room of Movie Madness, one of the country's only remaining video-rental stores.\n\nThe older I get, the more I appreciate that Portland doesn't feel like a city, but rather it's a bunch of neighborhoods quilted together.\n\nIt's easy to feel welcome here when there are free tiny libraries and flyers for different clubs and events around every corner.\n\nEverything I love about Portland, from the hiking trails to my favorite Thai soup spot (shoutout to Khao Moo Dang) to the drag scene, comes down to one thing: community.\n\nIt's an elusive concept I spent most of my 20s searching for in far-off places. In an ironic twist of fate that really pleases my mother, I ended up finding it in my hometown.",

    "description": "UN GEO report says ending this harm key to global transformation required ‘before collapse becomes inevitable’",
    "fullText": "UN GEO report says ending this harm key to global transformation required ‘before collapse becomes inevitable’\n\nThe unsustainable production of food and fossil fuels causes $5bn (£3.8bn) of environmental damage per hour, according to a major UN report.\n\nEnding this harm was a key part of the global transformation of governance, economics and finance required “before collapse becomes inevitable”, the experts said.\n\nThe Global Environment Outlook (GEO) report, which is produced by 200 researchers for the UN Environment Programme, said the climate crisis, destruction of nature and pollution could no longer be seen as simply environmental crises.\n\n“They are all undermining our economy, food security, water security, human health and they are also [national] security issues, leading to conflict in many parts of the world,” said Prof Robert Watson, the co-chair of the assessment.\n\nAll the environmental crises were worsening as the global population grows and required more food and energy, most of which was produced in ways that pollute the planet and destroy the natural world, the experts said. A sustainable world was possible, they said, but required political courage.\n\n“This is an urgent call to transform our human systems now before collapse becomes inevitable,” said Prof Edgar Gutiérrez-Espeleta, another co-chair and the former environment minister in Costa Rica.\n\n“The science is good. The solutions are known. What is required is the courage to act at the scale and speed that history demands,” he said, adding that the window for action was “rapidly narrowing”.\n\nThe experts acknowledged that the geopolitical situation today was difficult, with the US under Donald Trump, some other countries and corporate vested interests working to block or reverse environmental action. Watson, a former chair of leading international climate and biodiversity science groups, said: “The public have got to demand that they want a sustainable future for their children and their grandchildren. Most governments do try and respond.”\n\nThe GEO report is comprehensive – 1,100 pages this year – and is usually accompanied by a summary for policymakers, which is agreed by all the world’s countries. However, strong objections by countries including Saudi Arabia, Iran, Russia, Turkey and Argentina to references to fossil fuels, plastics, reduced meat in diets and other issues meant no agreement was reached this time.\n\nA statement made by the UK on behalf of 28 countries said: “We witnessed diversion attempts to question the scientific nature of this process. Our delegations fully respect every state’s right to safeguard their country’s national interests and rights, but science is not negotiable.”\n\nThe GEO report emphasised that the costs of action were much less than the costs of inaction in the long term, and estimated the benefits from climate action alone would be worth $20tn a year by 2070 and $100tn by 2100. “We need visionary countries and private sector [companies] to recognise they will make more profit by addressing these issues rather than ignoring them,” Watson said.\n\nThe report contained several “critical truths”, Gutiérrez-Espeleta said: environmental crises were political and security emergencies, threatening the social ties that held societies together. Today’s governments and economic systems were failing humanity and financial reform was the cornerstone of transformation, he said: “Environmental policy must become the backbone of national security, social justice, and economic strategy.”\n\nOne of the biggest issues was the $45tn a year in environmental damage caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas, and the pollution and destruction of nature caused by industrial agriculture, the report said. The food system carried the largest costs, at $20tn, with transport at $13tn and fossil-fuel powered electricity at $12tn.\n\nThese costs – called externalities by economists – must be priced into energy and food to reflect their real price and shift consumers towards greener choices, Watson said: “So we need social safety nets. We need to make sure that the poorest in society are not harmed by an increase in costs.”\n\nThe report suggests measures such as a universal basic income, taxes on meat and subsidies for healthy, plant-based foods.\n\nThere were also about $1.5tn in environmentally harmful subsidies to fossil fuels, food and mining, the report said. These needed to be removed or repurposed, it added. Watson noted that wind and solar energy was cheaper in many places but held back by vested interests in fossil fuel.\n\nThe climate crisis may be even worse than thought, he said: “We are likely to be underestimating the magnitude of climate change”, with global heating probably at the high end of the projections made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nRemoving fossil fuel subsidies could cut emissions by a third, the report said.",

    "fullText": "Billy McFarland is trying to rise from the ashes of Fyre Festival.\n\nHis latest event is PHNX — pronounced \"Phoenix.\" It attracted dozens of attendees over the weekend. Like the original Fyre Festival, it was heavily documented by camera crews and social media users.\n\nSince being released from prison in 2022, after pleading guilty to wire fraud charges related to Fyre Festival, McFarland has been planning redemption from the disastrous 2017 festival that left hundreds of attendees stranded, hungry, and thirsty on a Bahamian island and became the subject of a hit Netflix documentary.\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday, McFarland ran it back with a smaller crowd, a mix of parties, excursions, and musical guests like French Montana as the headliner on Utila Bay, an island off the coast of Honduras.\n\nTo everyone who laughed at the bathroom barge. To everyone who said there wouldn’t be power. Who wants to be part of history? See you in 4 days.\n\nGeneral admission tickets to PHNX cost $599. VIP passes went for up to $140,000 and included round-trip flights from Miami. PHNX offered all attendees brunch, lunch, dinner, and a handful of excursions, including scuba diving and a cave hike, in their ticket packages.\n\nThe itinerary was a far cry from the events that unfolded in 2017. Where unsanitary or simply unavailable bathrooms became a hallmark of Fyre Festival's failures, McFarland showed off a \"bathroom barge\" of floating port-a-potties for PHNX. He also shared fresh fruit stands and food options, including lobster, steak, and fresh salads — a much different menu from the infamous cheese sandwiches served at the first Fyre Festival.\n\nFestival-goers, McFarland, and performers took their followers along for the ride at PHNX 2025. The event was also available via livestream for paying viewers.\n\nOne performer, a DJ who goes by 220 Kid, documented his time at the festival in several videos. His post about the vegetarian food option went particularly viral. The plate of rice and a single cob of corn drew scrutiny and a call back to the meager cheese sandwiches from 2017.\n\nRappers Slim Jxmmi and Bobby Shmurda showed up, and a clip from headliner French Montana's set showed a modest crowd dancing.\n\nConfirmed ! French showed up every artist did! Love this island so much ! #fyrefestival #PHNX\n\n\"We set out to bring 400 people and a dozen artists to a private island in the Utila Bay Islands, and the experience exceeded every expectation,\" McFarland said in a statement. \"PHNX 2025 was a milestone moment for us.\"\n\nVideos showed dozens of festival-goers on the dance floor at different times. It's unclear how many people attended.\n\nPHNX appeared to sidestep the big issues that defined Fyre, but it's too early to tell whether the event represents a meaningful reset for McFarland.\n\n\"This is only the beginning — a major announcement is coming soon,\" McFarland said.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Congress urged to act against energy-hungry facilities blamed for increasing bills and worsening climate crisis\n\nA coalition of more than 230 environmental groups has demanded a national moratorium on new datacenters in the US, the latest salvo in a growing backlash to a booming artificial intelligence industry that has been blamed for escalating electricity bills and worsening the climate crisis.\n\nThe green groups, including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Food & Water Watch and dozens of local organizations, have urged members of Congress to halt the proliferation of energy-hungry datacenters, accusing them of causing planet-heating emissions, sucking up vast amounts of water and exacerbating electricity bill increases that have hit Americans this year.\n\n“The rapid, largely unregulated rise of datacenters to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans’ economic, environmental, climate and water security,” the letter states, adding that approval of new data centers should be paused until new regulations are put in place.\n\nThe push comes amid a growing revolt against moves by companies such as Meta, Google and Open AI to plow hundreds of billions of dollars into new datacenters, primarily to meet the huge computing demands of AI. At least 16 datacenter projects, worth a combined $64bn, have been blocked or delayed due to local opposition to rising electricity costs. The facilities’ need for huge amounts of water to cool down equipment has also proved controversial, particularly in drier areas where supplies are scarce.\n\nThese seemingly parochial concerns have now multiplied to become a potent political force, helping propel Democrats to a series of emphatic recent electoral successes in governor elections in Virginia and New Jersey as well as a stunning upset win in a special public service commission poll in Georgia, with candidates campaigning on lowering power bill costs and curbing datacenters.\n\nThis threatens to be a major headache for Donald Trump, who has aggressively pushed the growth of AI but also called himself the “affordability president” and vowed to cut energy costs in half in his first year.\n\nHowever, household electricity prices have increased by 13% so far under Trump and the president recently lashed out in the wake of the election losses, calling affordability a “fake narrative” and a “con job” created by Democrats. “They just say the word,” Trump said last week. “It doesn’t mean anything to anybody. They just say it – affordability.”\n\nYet about 80 million Americans are currently struggling to pay their bills for electricity and gas, with many voters regardless of political party blaming datacenters for this, according to Charles Hua, founder and executive director of PowerLines, a non-partisan organization that aims to reduce power bills.\n\n“We saw rising utility bills become a core concern in the New Jersey, Georgia and Virginia elections, which shows us there is a new politics in America – we are entering a new era that is all about electricity prices,” Hua said.\n\n“Nobody in America wants to pay more for electricity and we saw in Georgia a meaningful chunk of conservative voters vote against the Republican incumbents, which was staggering.”\n\nHua said the causes of the electricity cost rises were nuanced, with ageing transmission lines and damage caused by extreme weather also adding to utilities’ costs on top of the surging demand for power.\n\nBut it is the growth of datacenters to service AI – with electricity consumption set to nearly triple over the next decade, equivalent to powering 190m new homes – that is the focus of ire for voters as well as an unlikely sweep of politicians ranging from Bernie Sanders on the left to Marjorie Taylor Greene on the far right.\n\nMore broadly, almost half of Americans say the cost of living in the US, including power, food and other essentials, is the worst they can ever remember it being.\n\nThis focus on affordability has provided a new line of attack for an environmental movement that has struggled to counter Trump’s onslaught upon rules that reduce air and water pollution. The president has called the climate crisis a “hoax” and clean energy a “scam” and has slashed support for and even blocked new wind and solar projects, even though renewables are often the cheapest and fastest options for new power generation.\n\nAt the current rate of growth, datacenters could add up to 44m tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by 2030, equivalent to putting an extra 10m cars on to the road and exacerbating a climate crisis that is already spurring extreme weather disasters and ripping apart the fabric of the American insurance market.\n\nBut it is the impact upon power bills, rather than the climate crisis, that is causing anguish for most voters, acknowledged Emily Wurth, managing director of organizing at Food & Water Watch, the group behind the letter to lawmakers.\n\n“I’ve been amazed by the groundswell of grassroots, bipartisan opposition to this, in all types of communities across the US,” she said. “Everyone is affected by this, the opposition has been across the political spectrum. A lot of people don’t see the benefits coming from AI and feel they will be paying for it with their energy bills and water.\n\n“It’s an important talking point,” Wurth said of the affordability concerns. “We’ve seen outrageous utility price rises across the country and we are going to lean into this. Prices are going up across the board and this is something Americans really do care about.”",
