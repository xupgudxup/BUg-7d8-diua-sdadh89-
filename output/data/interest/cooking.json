    "fullText": "Portland, Oregon, isn't perfect.\n\nIt's not particularly diverse, and most restaurants close way too early for anyone under the age of 60. The \"Pacific Northwest freeze\" is a real thing: People here can be simultaneously too nice and impossible to befriend.\n\nWhen I left Portland in my early 20s to travel the world for almost a decade, I didn't think I'd ever move back. Growing up there was pretty magical, but I hated the city in the way most angsty teens hate their hometown.\n\nThen, amid the coronavirus pandemic, I booked a flight back to Portland to be near family. Five years later, I'm still here — and I can't see myself living anywhere else. Here's why.\n\nPortland is surrounded by natural beauty.\n\nLocals love to brag that you can be in the mountains or on the coast within an hour and a half — a luxury few cities can claim.\n\nBelieve it or not, you can even be in the rainforest in half an hour, surrounded by ferns and fluorescent-green moss.\n\nI regularly make the scenic drive to the Columbia River Gorge, a historic stretch dotted with tunnels and waterfalls, when I need to clear my mind. Stopping to stand at the base of a 620-foot waterfall and get misted in the face never fails to do the trick.\n\nThe natural beauty really is everywhere. On a casual walk around my neighborhood, I've found everything from fresh blackberries and wild bunnies to roaming chickens and secret gardens filled with dahlias and roses.\n\nI'm convinced Portland has more outstanding restaurants per capita than any other city.\n\nThough the city is predominantly white, my taste buds have been thrilled in recent years to see diversity reflected in Portland's rise to foodie fame.\n\nThe star of the show is Kann, a James Beard Award-winning restaurant by Gregory Gourdet, where \"Haitian cuisine meets Pacific Northwest bounty,\" and an absolutely mind-blowing plantain brioche meets my mouth.\n\nThen there's Jinju Patisserie, named the country's most outstanding bakery at the James Beard Awards earlier this year. There, two Korean-born pastry chefs whip up croissants that rival any I've had in Paris.\n\nBut award winners barely scratch the surface. My personal list of outstanding local Thai restaurants is longer than my Trader Joe's receipts.\n\nPlus, Portland is especially known for its food trucks, which is how I first tried Guyanese food (at Bake on the Run), snow-cheese Korean fried chicken (at Frybaby), and Puerto Rican-Philly fusion dishes (at Papi Sal's).\n\nI came out after leaving Oregon, and before moving back, I'd only lived in areas where the LGBTQ+ community was either small or centered on gay men.\n\nPortland is the first time I've felt included, and the queer community here is at the heart of why I chose to stay. This city's LGBTQ+ community feels refreshingly queer.\n\nMy friends and I joke that most bars in Portland are gay bars just because the local population has so many queer folks. Many popular nightlife spots regularly host LGBTQ+ events, even if they aren't specifically \"gay bars.\"\n\nOn any given weekend, I might have to choose between a \"Twilight\"-themed drag show, an LGBTQ+ storytelling event, a queer pie-eating contest, a lesbian dance party, or a trans wrestling match.\n\nBecause it rarely takes me longer than 15 minutes to get anywhere around the city, I can try to squeeze all the events in.\n\nAnd when I wake up exhausted and hungry on Sunday morning, I can join my fellow Portland gays doing what we love most — waiting in inordinately long brunch lines.\n\nIf you've got a special interest, you're bound to find a group of people here who are loudly and proudly into the same thing, no matter how niche or offbeat.\n\nCan you guess where I've made the most friends in Portland? If you said, \"a weekly '80s-themed mall walk in the city's half-abandoned Lloyd Center mall,\" you'd be right.\n\nWhen I picked up rollerskating during the pandemic, I was thrilled to learn that the city runs a \"secret roller disco\" every week in undisclosed pop-up locations like warehouse parking lots (and the same half-abandoned mall).\n\nOver the summer, I participated in a watermelon-wrestling fundraiser. In the fall, I got to take an entire four-week class about 1970s cult horror in the back room of Movie Madness, one of the country's only remaining video-rental stores.\n\nThe older I get, the more I appreciate that Portland doesn't feel like a city, but rather it's a bunch of neighborhoods quilted together.\n\nIt's easy to feel welcome here when there are free tiny libraries and flyers for different clubs and events around every corner.\n\nEverything I love about Portland, from the hiking trails to my favorite Thai soup spot (shoutout to Khao Moo Dang) to the drag scene, comes down to one thing: community.\n\nIt's an elusive concept I spent most of my 20s searching for in far-off places. In an ironic twist of fate that really pleases my mother, I ended up finding it in my hometown.",

    "description": "UN GEO report says ending this harm key to global transformation required ‘before collapse becomes inevitable’",
    "fullText": "UN GEO report says ending this harm key to global transformation required ‘before collapse becomes inevitable’\n\nThe unsustainable production of food and fossil fuels causes $5bn (£3.8bn) of environmental damage per hour, according to a major UN report.\n\nEnding this harm was a key part of the global transformation of governance, economics and finance required “before collapse becomes inevitable”, the experts said.\n\nThe Global Environment Outlook (GEO) report, which is produced by 200 researchers for the UN Environment Programme, said the climate crisis, destruction of nature and pollution could no longer be seen as simply environmental crises.\n\n“They are all undermining our economy, food security, water security, human health and they are also [national] security issues, leading to conflict in many parts of the world,” said Prof Robert Watson, the co-chair of the assessment.\n\nAll the environmental crises were worsening as the global population grows and required more food and energy, most of which was produced in ways that pollute the planet and destroy the natural world, the experts said. A sustainable world was possible, they said, but required political courage.\n\n“This is an urgent call to transform our human systems now before collapse becomes inevitable,” said Prof Edgar Gutiérrez-Espeleta, another co-chair and the former environment minister in Costa Rica.\n\n“The science is good. The solutions are known. What is required is the courage to act at the scale and speed that history demands,” he said, adding that the window for action was “rapidly narrowing”.\n\nThe experts acknowledged that the geopolitical situation today was difficult, with the US under Donald Trump, some other countries and corporate vested interests working to block or reverse environmental action. Watson, a former chair of leading international climate and biodiversity science groups, said: “The public have got to demand that they want a sustainable future for their children and their grandchildren. Most governments do try and respond.”\n\nThe GEO report is comprehensive – 1,100 pages this year – and is usually accompanied by a summary for policymakers, which is agreed by all the world’s countries. However, strong objections by countries including Saudi Arabia, Iran, Russia, Turkey and Argentina to references to fossil fuels, plastics, reduced meat in diets and other issues meant no agreement was reached this time.\n\nA statement made by the UK on behalf of 28 countries said: “We witnessed diversion attempts to question the scientific nature of this process. Our delegations fully respect every state’s right to safeguard their country’s national interests and rights, but science is not negotiable.”\n\nThe GEO report emphasised that the costs of action were much less than the costs of inaction in the long term, and estimated the benefits from climate action alone would be worth $20tn a year by 2070 and $100tn by 2100. “We need visionary countries and private sector [companies] to recognise they will make more profit by addressing these issues rather than ignoring them,” Watson said.\n\nThe report contained several “critical truths”, Gutiérrez-Espeleta said: environmental crises were political and security emergencies, threatening the social ties that held societies together. Today’s governments and economic systems were failing humanity and financial reform was the cornerstone of transformation, he said: “Environmental policy must become the backbone of national security, social justice, and economic strategy.”\n\nOne of the biggest issues was the $45tn a year in environmental damage caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas, and the pollution and destruction of nature caused by industrial agriculture, the report said. The food system carried the largest costs, at $20tn, with transport at $13tn and fossil-fuel powered electricity at $12tn.\n\nThese costs – called externalities by economists – must be priced into energy and food to reflect their real price and shift consumers towards greener choices, Watson said: “So we need social safety nets. We need to make sure that the poorest in society are not harmed by an increase in costs.”\n\nThe report suggests measures such as a universal basic income, taxes on meat and subsidies for healthy, plant-based foods.\n\nThere were also about $1.5tn in environmentally harmful subsidies to fossil fuels, food and mining, the report said. These needed to be removed or repurposed, it added. Watson noted that wind and solar energy was cheaper in many places but held back by vested interests in fossil fuel.\n\nThe climate crisis may be even worse than thought, he said: “We are likely to be underestimating the magnitude of climate change”, with global heating probably at the high end of the projections made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nRemoving fossil fuel subsidies could cut emissions by a third, the report said.",

    "fullText": "Billy McFarland is trying to rise from the ashes of Fyre Festival.\n\nHis latest event is PHNX — pronounced \"Phoenix.\" It attracted dozens of attendees over the weekend. Like the original Fyre Festival, it was heavily documented by camera crews and social media users.\n\nSince being released from prison in 2022, after pleading guilty to wire fraud charges related to Fyre Festival, McFarland has been planning redemption from the disastrous 2017 festival that left hundreds of attendees stranded, hungry, and thirsty on a Bahamian island and became the subject of a hit Netflix documentary.\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday, McFarland ran it back with a smaller crowd, a mix of parties, excursions, and musical guests like French Montana as the headliner on Utila Bay, an island off the coast of Honduras.\n\nTo everyone who laughed at the bathroom barge. To everyone who said there wouldn’t be power. Who wants to be part of history? See you in 4 days.\n\nGeneral admission tickets to PHNX cost $599. VIP passes went for up to $140,000 and included round-trip flights from Miami. PHNX offered all attendees brunch, lunch, dinner, and a handful of excursions, including scuba diving and a cave hike, in their ticket packages.\n\nThe itinerary was a far cry from the events that unfolded in 2017. Where unsanitary or simply unavailable bathrooms became a hallmark of Fyre Festival's failures, McFarland showed off a \"bathroom barge\" of floating port-a-potties for PHNX. He also shared fresh fruit stands and food options, including lobster, steak, and fresh salads — a much different menu from the infamous cheese sandwiches served at the first Fyre Festival.\n\nFestival-goers, McFarland, and performers took their followers along for the ride at PHNX 2025. The event was also available via livestream for paying viewers.\n\nOne performer, a DJ who goes by 220 Kid, documented his time at the festival in several videos. His post about the vegetarian food option went particularly viral. The plate of rice and a single cob of corn drew scrutiny and a call back to the meager cheese sandwiches from 2017.\n\nRappers Slim Jxmmi and Bobby Shmurda showed up, and a clip from headliner French Montana's set showed a modest crowd dancing.\n\nConfirmed ! French showed up every artist did! Love this island so much ! #fyrefestival #PHNX\n\n\"We set out to bring 400 people and a dozen artists to a private island in the Utila Bay Islands, and the experience exceeded every expectation,\" McFarland said in a statement. \"PHNX 2025 was a milestone moment for us.\"\n\nVideos showed dozens of festival-goers on the dance floor at different times. It's unclear how many people attended.\n\nPHNX appeared to sidestep the big issues that defined Fyre, but it's too early to tell whether the event represents a meaningful reset for McFarland.\n\n\"This is only the beginning — a major announcement is coming soon,\" McFarland said.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Congress urged to act against energy-hungry facilities blamed for increasing bills and worsening climate crisis\n\nA coalition of more than 230 environmental groups has demanded a national moratorium on new datacenters in the US, the latest salvo in a growing backlash to a booming artificial intelligence industry that has been blamed for escalating electricity bills and worsening the climate crisis.\n\nThe green groups, including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Food & Water Watch and dozens of local organizations, have urged members of Congress to halt the proliferation of energy-hungry datacenters, accusing them of causing planet-heating emissions, sucking up vast amounts of water and exacerbating electricity bill increases that have hit Americans this year.\n\n“The rapid, largely unregulated rise of datacenters to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans’ economic, environmental, climate and water security,” the letter states, adding that approval of new data centers should be paused until new regulations are put in place.\n\nThe push comes amid a growing revolt against moves by companies such as Meta, Google and Open AI to plow hundreds of billions of dollars into new datacenters, primarily to meet the huge computing demands of AI. At least 16 datacenter projects, worth a combined $64bn, have been blocked or delayed due to local opposition to rising electricity costs. The facilities’ need for huge amounts of water to cool down equipment has also proved controversial, particularly in drier areas where supplies are scarce.\n\nThese seemingly parochial concerns have now multiplied to become a potent political force, helping propel Democrats to a series of emphatic recent electoral successes in governor elections in Virginia and New Jersey as well as a stunning upset win in a special public service commission poll in Georgia, with candidates campaigning on lowering power bill costs and curbing datacenters.\n\nThis threatens to be a major headache for Donald Trump, who has aggressively pushed the growth of AI but also called himself the “affordability president” and vowed to cut energy costs in half in his first year.\n\nHowever, household electricity prices have increased by 13% so far under Trump and the president recently lashed out in the wake of the election losses, calling affordability a “fake narrative” and a “con job” created by Democrats. “They just say the word,” Trump said last week. “It doesn’t mean anything to anybody. They just say it – affordability.”\n\nYet about 80 million Americans are currently struggling to pay their bills for electricity and gas, with many voters regardless of political party blaming datacenters for this, according to Charles Hua, founder and executive director of PowerLines, a non-partisan organization that aims to reduce power bills.\n\n“We saw rising utility bills become a core concern in the New Jersey, Georgia and Virginia elections, which shows us there is a new politics in America – we are entering a new era that is all about electricity prices,” Hua said.\n\n“Nobody in America wants to pay more for electricity and we saw in Georgia a meaningful chunk of conservative voters vote against the Republican incumbents, which was staggering.”\n\nHua said the causes of the electricity cost rises were nuanced, with ageing transmission lines and damage caused by extreme weather also adding to utilities’ costs on top of the surging demand for power.\n\nBut it is the growth of datacenters to service AI – with electricity consumption set to nearly triple over the next decade, equivalent to powering 190m new homes – that is the focus of ire for voters as well as an unlikely sweep of politicians ranging from Bernie Sanders on the left to Marjorie Taylor Greene on the far right.\n\nMore broadly, almost half of Americans say the cost of living in the US, including power, food and other essentials, is the worst they can ever remember it being.\n\nThis focus on affordability has provided a new line of attack for an environmental movement that has struggled to counter Trump’s onslaught upon rules that reduce air and water pollution. The president has called the climate crisis a “hoax” and clean energy a “scam” and has slashed support for and even blocked new wind and solar projects, even though renewables are often the cheapest and fastest options for new power generation.\n\nAt the current rate of growth, datacenters could add up to 44m tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by 2030, equivalent to putting an extra 10m cars on to the road and exacerbating a climate crisis that is already spurring extreme weather disasters and ripping apart the fabric of the American insurance market.\n\nBut it is the impact upon power bills, rather than the climate crisis, that is causing anguish for most voters, acknowledged Emily Wurth, managing director of organizing at Food & Water Watch, the group behind the letter to lawmakers.\n\n“I’ve been amazed by the groundswell of grassroots, bipartisan opposition to this, in all types of communities across the US,” she said. “Everyone is affected by this, the opposition has been across the political spectrum. A lot of people don’t see the benefits coming from AI and feel they will be paying for it with their energy bills and water.\n\n“It’s an important talking point,” Wurth said of the affordability concerns. “We’ve seen outrageous utility price rises across the country and we are going to lean into this. Prices are going up across the board and this is something Americans really do care about.”",
