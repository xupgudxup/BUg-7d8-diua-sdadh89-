    "fullText": "Billy McFarland is trying to rise from the ashes of Fyre Festival.\n\nHis latest event is PHNX — pronounced \"Phoenix.\" It attracted dozens of attendees over the weekend. Like the original Fyre Festival, it was heavily documented by camera crews and social media users.\n\nSince being released from prison in 2022, after pleading guilty to wire fraud charges related to Fyre Festival, McFarland has been planning redemption from the disastrous 2017 festival that left hundreds of attendees stranded, hungry, and thirsty on a Bahamian island and became the subject of a hit Netflix documentary.\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday, McFarland ran it back with a smaller crowd, a mix of parties, excursions, and musical guests like French Montana as the headliner on Utila Bay, an island off the coast of Honduras.\n\nTo everyone who laughed at the bathroom barge. To everyone who said there wouldn’t be power. Who wants to be part of history? See you in 4 days.\n\nGeneral admission tickets to PHNX cost $599. VIP passes went for up to $140,000 and included round-trip flights from Miami. PHNX offered all attendees brunch, lunch, dinner, and a handful of excursions, including scuba diving and a cave hike, in their ticket packages.\n\nThe itinerary was a far cry from the events that unfolded in 2017. Where unsanitary or simply unavailable bathrooms became a hallmark of Fyre Festival's failures, McFarland showed off a \"bathroom barge\" of floating port-a-potties for PHNX. He also shared fresh fruit stands and food options, including lobster, steak, and fresh salads — a much different menu from the infamous cheese sandwiches served at the first Fyre Festival.\n\nFestival-goers, McFarland, and performers took their followers along for the ride at PHNX 2025. The event was also available via livestream for paying viewers.\n\nOne performer, a DJ who goes by 220 Kid, documented his time at the festival in several videos. His post about the vegetarian food option went particularly viral. The plate of rice and a single cob of corn drew scrutiny and a call back to the meager cheese sandwiches from 2017.\n\nRappers Slim Jxmmi and Bobby Shmurda showed up, and a clip from headliner French Montana's set showed a modest crowd dancing.\n\nConfirmed ! French showed up every artist did! Love this island so much ! #fyrefestival #PHNX\n\n\"We set out to bring 400 people and a dozen artists to a private island in the Utila Bay Islands, and the experience exceeded every expectation,\" McFarland said in a statement. \"PHNX 2025 was a milestone moment for us.\"\n\nVideos showed dozens of festival-goers on the dance floor at different times. It's unclear how many people attended.\n\nPHNX appeared to sidestep the big issues that defined Fyre, but it's too early to tell whether the event represents a meaningful reset for McFarland.\n\n\"This is only the beginning — a major announcement is coming soon,\" McFarland said.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Congress urged to act against energy-hungry facilities blamed for increasing bills and worsening climate crisis\n\nA coalition of more than 230 environmental groups has demanded a national moratorium on new datacenters in the US, the latest salvo in a growing backlash to a booming artificial intelligence industry that has been blamed for escalating electricity bills and worsening the climate crisis.\n\nThe green groups, including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Food & Water Watch and dozens of local organizations, have urged members of Congress to halt the proliferation of energy-hungry datacenters, accusing them of causing planet-heating emissions, sucking up vast amounts of water and exacerbating electricity bill increases that have hit Americans this year.\n\n“The rapid, largely unregulated rise of datacenters to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans’ economic, environmental, climate and water security,” the letter states, adding that approval of new data centers should be paused until new regulations are put in place.\n\nThe push comes amid a growing revolt against moves by companies such as Meta, Google and Open AI to plow hundreds of billions of dollars into new datacenters, primarily to meet the huge computing demands of AI. At least 16 datacenter projects, worth a combined $64bn, have been blocked or delayed due to local opposition to rising electricity costs. The facilities’ need for huge amounts of water to cool down equipment has also proved controversial, particularly in drier areas where supplies are scarce.\n\nThese seemingly parochial concerns have now multiplied to become a potent political force, helping propel Democrats to a series of emphatic recent electoral successes in governor elections in Virginia and New Jersey as well as a stunning upset win in a special public service commission poll in Georgia, with candidates campaigning on lowering power bill costs and curbing datacenters.\n\nThis threatens to be a major headache for Donald Trump, who has aggressively pushed the growth of AI but also called himself the “affordability president” and vowed to cut energy costs in half in his first year.\n\nHowever, household electricity prices have increased by 13% so far under Trump and the president recently lashed out in the wake of the election losses, calling affordability a “fake narrative” and a “con job” created by Democrats. “They just say the word,” Trump said last week. “It doesn’t mean anything to anybody. They just say it – affordability.”\n\nYet about 80 million Americans are currently struggling to pay their bills for electricity and gas, with many voters regardless of political party blaming datacenters for this, according to Charles Hua, founder and executive director of PowerLines, a non-partisan organization that aims to reduce power bills.\n\n“We saw rising utility bills become a core concern in the New Jersey, Georgia and Virginia elections, which shows us there is a new politics in America – we are entering a new era that is all about electricity prices,” Hua said.\n\n“Nobody in America wants to pay more for electricity and we saw in Georgia a meaningful chunk of conservative voters vote against the Republican incumbents, which was staggering.”\n\nHua said the causes of the electricity cost rises were nuanced, with ageing transmission lines and damage caused by extreme weather also adding to utilities’ costs on top of the surging demand for power.\n\nBut it is the growth of datacenters to service AI – with electricity consumption set to nearly triple over the next decade, equivalent to powering 190m new homes – that is the focus of ire for voters as well as an unlikely sweep of politicians ranging from Bernie Sanders on the left to Marjorie Taylor Greene on the far right.\n\nMore broadly, almost half of Americans say the cost of living in the US, including power, food and other essentials, is the worst they can ever remember it being.\n\nThis focus on affordability has provided a new line of attack for an environmental movement that has struggled to counter Trump’s onslaught upon rules that reduce air and water pollution. The president has called the climate crisis a “hoax” and clean energy a “scam” and has slashed support for and even blocked new wind and solar projects, even though renewables are often the cheapest and fastest options for new power generation.\n\nAt the current rate of growth, datacenters could add up to 44m tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by 2030, equivalent to putting an extra 10m cars on to the road and exacerbating a climate crisis that is already spurring extreme weather disasters and ripping apart the fabric of the American insurance market.\n\nBut it is the impact upon power bills, rather than the climate crisis, that is causing anguish for most voters, acknowledged Emily Wurth, managing director of organizing at Food & Water Watch, the group behind the letter to lawmakers.\n\n“I’ve been amazed by the groundswell of grassroots, bipartisan opposition to this, in all types of communities across the US,” she said. “Everyone is affected by this, the opposition has been across the political spectrum. A lot of people don’t see the benefits coming from AI and feel they will be paying for it with their energy bills and water.\n\n“It’s an important talking point,” Wurth said of the affordability concerns. “We’ve seen outrageous utility price rises across the country and we are going to lean into this. Prices are going up across the board and this is something Americans really do care about.”",
