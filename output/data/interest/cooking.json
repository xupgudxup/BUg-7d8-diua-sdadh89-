    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Mark Penn, the 71-year-old CEO and Chairman of Stagwell, based in Miami Beach. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy career spans 40 years in market research, advertising, public relations, polling, and consulting.\n\nBefore founding Stagwell, a global marketing and communications company, I served as an executive vice president and chief strategy officer at Microsoft.\n\nI'm also the cofounder and CEO of Penn Schoen Berland, a market research firm that I built and sold to WPP, a British multinational communications company.\n\nFor six years, I served as the White House pollster to President Bill Clinton and was the chief strategist for his 1996 reelection campaign. I later served as chief strategist to Hillary Clinton throughout her Senate campaigns and 2008 presidential bid.\n\nAt WPP, I saw the ins and outs of big marketing and decided it wasn't people-oriented enough. I decided to establish a new company to address the problems I observed.\n\nI was still at Microsoft, and I had been promoted to head all the advertising. The chief strategy officer, Steve Ballmer, came to me and said, \"You know, that idea you've had? I like that idea, and I'll be your core investor.\"\n\nOn September 15, 2015, we started Stagwell with a single employee in a half-rented office.\n\nHere's what a typical day looks like 10 years later with a team of 13,000 employees worldwide.\n\nSeveral people on my team are up for 4 a.m., but not me. I sleep until at least 7 or 7:30 a.m.\n\nI'm, unfortunately, the type of person who picks up my phone as soon as I wake up. I don't spend the whole day on the phone, but I do like to check in periodically to see what's going on.\n\nI'm on the phone between 7 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. I'm watching a bit of TV to catch up on the news and shoot out a couple of emails.\n\nI don't drink coffee, I skip breakfast, and I don't have a morning exercise routine. I have a core lounging period, then I shower at 8:30 a.m. and get dressed.\n\nMy goal is to be in the office exactly at 9 a.m., five days a week.\n\nI go into the office depending on which city I'm in, as I visit our offices in Miami Beach, Washington, D.C., and New York. I only work remotely if I get a little behind during the day.\n\nWhen I arrive at the office, I have a lot of meetings, but sometimes I also have interviews and TV appearances.\n\nI've organized the business by corporate leadership and its divisions. I want everyone to have a clear understanding of what's happening in the company. I like my team to know and work with each other, even if they're no longer in the same place.\n\nComing out of Microsoft, I saw how Steve Ballmer had a huge team under him, but he would always manage to leave at 5:30 p.m. The answer was that he planned out his time well.\n\nMy chief of staff manages my schedule and who has access to it, and then there are one or two other administrative staff behind them — they sort things out once or twice a week.\n\nGenerally, I order a Postmates lunch. I'm a big fan of steamed Chinese food, so I typically order steamed dishes with vegetables and hot-and-sour soup, and sometimes a sushi and sashimi combo.\n\nI prefer not to eat during meetings; it's essential to remain focused on the people I'm meeting with. I squeeze in lunch between meetings.\n\nAround 12:30 p.m., I schedule a half-hour catch-up, which could be spent with HR, marketing, a client meeting, or an ad hoc meeting for something that has come up.\n\nThere's no breathing room, pretty much from 12:30 p.m. to 5 p.m., with lots of meetings. There are many PowerPoint presentations.\n\nI used to do presidential races, so that was constant, 'Oh my god, the candidate did what?' situations. We don't get as much derailment at Stagwell.\n\nSometimes things run long, sometimes things break down in some way, but it's pretty unusual.\n\nI wish I knew the secret to maintaining high energy consistently. I drink sugar-free Snapple and Diet Coke; I don't drink much coffee or caffeine. I have a naturally evenly balanced level of energy.\n\nThe days on the road are more interesting than the days in the office, whether that means visiting an office, holding a town hall, meeting a combination of clients, or attending a board meeting.\n\nMy day is structured around meetings with relevant stakeholders, where I present either their current progress or their proposed plans, and gather feedback on their accomplishments and approval for their future initiatives.\n\nAll other stakeholders are always present, so that if they want to comment, they have the opportunity to do so immediately, and also so that everyone is informed about what's going on.\n\nWhen people are siloed too much and don't understand each other, they'll never be able to collaborate or build a great culture.\n\nWhen I get home from the office, I usually have dinner with my wife. We have four kids, but they're all older now. For dinner, I like a lot of protein, a vegetable, and a baked potato.\n\nAfter dinner, I might catch up on the news. My wife tends to go to sleep a little earlier than I do, around 10 p.m., and I might spend some time catching up on the news, Netflix, or other things.\n\nI read a lot of news and information, but I also enjoy watching science fiction shows. I can get hooked on a series and stay up to 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. — that can be disastrous.\n\nThe last series I got hooked on was Lioness on Prime Video. I'm watching the final episode of Foundation on Apple TV, which has been the most interesting show of the season.\n\nBefore I go to bed, I'll make sure I'm pretty covered on the news.\n\nI like playing Neural Bridge when I'm having trouble falling asleep.\n\nI avoid working on weekends unless there's an emergency or crisis. I respect my employees' time. Occasionally, there's some Sunday night work, but my goal is to ensure every position is filled with someone who's really effective at what they do, let them do their job, and have them report. I don't believe in micromanaging people.\n\nI encourage my team to shoot for the stars, and in a sense, they come back with a big, ambitious plan. I'd rather you reach 90% of an ambitious plan than 100% of an unambitious one.",

    "description": "Researchers noticed ‘dramatic’ changes in nutrients in crops, including drop in zinc and rise in lead",
    "fullText": "Researchers noticed ‘dramatic’ changes in nutrients in crops, including drop in zinc and rise in lead\n\nMore carbon dioxide in the environment is making food more calorific but less nutritious – and also potentially more toxic, a study has found.\n\nSterre ter Haar, a lecturer at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and other researchers at the institution created a method to compare multiple studies on plants’ responses to increased CO2 levels. The results, she said, were a shock: although crop yields increase, they become less nutrient-dense. While zinc levels in particular drop, lead levels increase.\n\n“Seeing how dramatic some of the nutritional changes were, and how this differed across plants, was a big surprise,” she told the Guardian. “We aren’t seeing a simple dilution effect but rather a complete shift in the composition of our foods … This also raises the question of whether we should adjust our diets in some way, or how we grow or produce our food.”\n\nWhile scientists have been looking at the effects of more CO2 in the atmosphere on plants for a decade, their work has been difficult to compare. The new research established a baseline measurement derived from the observation that the gas appears to have a linear effect on growth, meaning that if the CO2 level doubles, so does the effect on nutrients. This made it possible to compare almost 60,000 measurements across 32 nutrients and 43 crops, including rice, potatoes, tomatoes and wheat.\n\n“Although there was a lot of data from previous studies, there were few answers,” said Ter Haar. “These studies used paired experiments, where plants were grown under identical conditions except for one thing: the CO2 level. This gives insight into possible changes, but the sample sizes were usually too small to draw conclusions from. Comparing these individual studies with each other was difficult because, as we know, the baseline of CO2 is continuously increasing in our atmosphere, meaning that the baseline in these experiments is also increasing.”\n\nTheir “baseline” measurement was a gas concentration of 350 parts per million – sometimes referred to as the last “safe” level. They compared this with a concentration of 550 parts per million, which some scientists expect to be reached by 2065. Most nutrients would respond negatively to the rise in concentration, they said, with an average drop of 3.2%.\n\nHowever, zinc in chickpeas would be expected to plummet by up to 37.5%, with a “significant” decrease in protein, zinc and iron in essential crops such as rice and wheat. The researchers warned of “devastating health consequences” including “hidden hunger, where people have sufficient food calorically but insufficient nutrients”.\n\nThe CO2 level is now 425.2 parts per million, the paper said, which had already resulted in “lowered levels of plant nutrition due to CO2 rise”.\n\nThe study is part of a growing body of research on the impact of climate breakdown on crops, not only outdoors but also in artificial conditions. The Netherlands is one of the world’s largest agricultural exporters, with three-quarters of its production for export and more than 4,100 hectares of greenhouses, where crops are grown in CO2-enriched environments to increase the yield.\n\n“Climate change isn’t a faraway problem,” said Ter Haar. “The effects are already on our dinner plate.”\n\nOther experts welcomed the Dutch study, saying it was a good basis for further investigation. Courtney Leisner, an assistant professor at the school of plant and environmental sciences at Virginia Tech in the US, coauthored a study earlier this year on how crop improvement strategies could counteract the negative effects of CO2 on crop quality. “This study offers critical insights into how environmental conditions affect crop nutritional quality, which is essential for sustaining future food security,” she said.\n\nThere are, however, other factors such as fertiliser application that play an important role in how nutritious our crops are, said Jan Verhagen, a researcher on climate change and sustainable agriculture at Wageningen University.\n\n“Indeed, nutrient levels in plants are changing,” he said. “Whether this is only related to CO2 is, I believe, less clear … we know that nutrition is a key factor in food security and health in general, so it makes sense to shift the focus on this topic.”\n\nHe said more experiments would be needed to help design breeding programmes for crops with certain nutrient levels under different environmental stresses to better understand the effects of agricultural practices.\n\nThe meta-analysis raises as many questions as it answers, said Ter Haar – who wants to do further study on climate change and nutrients.\n\n“Our goal isn’t to scare people,” she said. “The first step in solving a problem is acknowledging it, and with that, we think our study could be a useful puzzle piece.”\n\nThe research was published in the journal Global Change Biology.",

    "description": "Every if they've been around for many years, the quality can start to slip at some fast food restaurants. Here's one burger chain customers aren't happy with.",
    "fullText": "One might argue that the longest running and most popular fast food burger chains (think McDonald's, Burger King, and White Castle) have stood the test of time by maintaining consistency in the quality of their food. Regrettably, due to a variety of factors including the rising cost of ingredients, some beloved fast food chains are losing their edge in 2025. Case in point: according to a number of Whataburger customers, the popular southern burger chain's food quality has significantly dwindled.\n\nWhile smaller than some fast food mega-chains, Whataburger is another long-running quick-service chain that first opened in 1950 in Corpus Christi, Texas. Today, the burger chain has a total of over 1,000 locations, close to 800 of which are located in Texas. Whataburger has a variety of popular menu items but is mostly known for its burgers that are made-to-order with never frozen beef patties.\n\nHowever, according to several customers on Reddit in the r/Whataburger thread, the quality of Whataburger has gone down in recent years, mainly since the start of the pandemic. The original poster, a self-described lifelong Whataburger diner, claims to have noticed a difference in taste, to which numerous fellow Redditors agree.\n\nIt should be noted that despite customer complaints, Whataburger saw a sales growth of 9.4% in 2024, amounting to the highest revenue in its history, according to data from Franchise Times. Meanwhile, McDonald's, the largest quick service restaurant in the world, experienced a small 0.9% sales growth in 2024.\n\nSome Redditors are not happy with the state of their Whataburger burgers and fries in particular. One customer stated, \"I'm in Texas and the locations near me have really turned bad. They were once really good and fresh, now the 20-25 minute wait is for old tasting and low quality burgers and fries and breakfast.\" Many complaints have to do with the fries, which are reportedly no longer hot and crispy like they used to be, as well as the decrease in burger toppings and overall quality.\n\nSome also have complaints about the poor service they've received. One person vented, \"Quality of food has dropped since they sold out and customer service diminished as well. I gave up on them 2 years ago. Even though the free meal offers kept getting sent out for me to return, I declined them.\" There is speculation online that the quality of Whataburger's food has declined since the majority stake in the company was sold in 2019 to Chicago-based investment bank BDT Capital Partners.\n\nAs with many business transitions from family-owned to corporate-owned, there is a perception of reduced attention to quality to accommodate for expansion. However, it's difficult to quantify whether the food has gone downhill across the board or, as with many fast food restaurants, people have received a bad batch here and there. You'll have to decide the truth of Whataburger for yourself.\n\nFor more food and drink goodness, Get taste tests, food & drink news, deals from your favorite chains, recipes, cooking tips, and more!",

    "description": "Iowa 80 in Walcott, Iowa stretches 150 football fields and serves 350,000 meals a year. It's more than just a stop on the road for truckers, though.",
    "fullText": "I've often driven past truckers feeling frustrated by their slow speed or uneasy that one might merge into my lane. I never gave much thought to who was behind the wheel.\n\nHowever, Iowa 80, the world's largest truck stop, cracked my heart open a bit.\n\nIowa 80's been dubbed the \"Disney World\" for truckers, but it's much more than its flashy signs, lines of semis, and large buffet. It's a home away from home for the people who move 70% — $13 trillion worth — of the goods Americans eat and buy.\n\nIowa 80 is a place where truckers can find some temporary peace, a shower, and even a dental exam. I was surprised to learn just how important a truck stop like this can be for people bound to the highways.\n\nIt sits along I-80 in Walcott, Iowa, and spans 225 acres. It has 900 parking spots, nine restaurants, 24 showers, and a massive chrome shop.\n\nIt's not in any world record books, though. After decades of folks saying, \"This has got to be the biggest truck stop in the world,\" the family behind Iowa 80 adopted the name. Now it's on dozens of signs around the property.\n\nIowa 80 is in a prime location, along one of America's busiest highways that connects New York City and Chicago to Des Moines and San Francisco. Plus, as the nation's top producer of corn and eggs, Iowa is a major agricultural shipping hub.\n\nWhat sets this truck stop apart, besides its size, is that it's one of the few mom-and-pop ones still around.\n\nOwned by the Moon family since 1964, Iowa 80 always has parking. Its main restaurant makes a surprising amount of food from scratch. It's a welcome change, truckers told me, from the big chains, like TA or Pilot, which often have full parking lots and fuel stations and only offer fast food to eat.\n\nI knew it was going to be big. But even I had underestimated the size. When I walked in, I thought, 'How on Earth am I going to see it all?'\n\nBig guys with their big gulps parted ways under the old-timey truck hanging over the entrance.\n\nWalking in, it felt like a shopping mall, complete with a food court filled with Orange Julius, Wendy's, and Taco Bell. On the right, the Iowa 80 Kitchen churned out homemade meals that were delicious.\n\nIt's no surprise they're working with a huge quantity of food. In their 61 years, they've gone through 23 million eggs. Bacon is one of the first things to hit the ovens each morning. The staff has to juggle both breakfast and lunch prep early to beat the rush.\n\nFor its size, I expected a lot of the food to be frozen. Indeed, the scrambled eggs and biscuits did arrive pre-cooked and frozen. However, most of the main dishes were cranked out by hand.\n\nChef Chris Han uses her grandfather's recipe for meatloaf, which includes chopped onions, celery, a tomato sauce mixture, breadcrumbs, and ground beef. She incorporates it all together in a 40-year-old mixer.\n\nThe cooks told me they tried to switch to pre-made ranch dressing, but there was an uproar among customers. So they went back to mixing it themselves. Mayo arrives in big buckets. That gets mixed with six gallons of buttermilk and nine packets of ranch seasoning.\n\nDiners have two options at Iowa 80 Kitchen. They can either pay for the buffet for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Or they can order off the expansive menu.\n\nThe Hungryman is a crowd favorite, with three kinds of meat, hash browns, eggs, and pancakes. When it hit my table, I couldn't believe people finish it.\n\nThese are sweet cream pancakes, which means they're made with heavy cream instead of milk or buttermilk. This swap felt like a brilliant indulgence to me.\n\nDespite sitting out for a bit while we took pictures, these pancakes had an incredible crisp on the outside. On the inside, they were still fluffy and almost gooey. I loved the unique tang to them.\n\nThis dish sang of Midwest comfort. I grew up a few hours south of Iowa 80, and it reminded me of my mom's recipe (I plead the fifth on which is better). It was warm, melty, and full of interesting textures, thanks to the breadcrumbs and celery.\n\nThe truckers I spoke to said that it's easy to get obese working as professional drivers. Most truck stops only have fast food options.\n\nThat's why Iowa 80 Kitchen means so much to them. It's a warm, home-cooked meal, they said. I wondered if that sentiment would excuse the few things that arrived frozen.\n\nLee Meier, granddaughter of the founders and the current marketing manager, took me on a tour of the massive truck stop. She explained that they wanted to include all these amenities — like 24 showers, a small gym, a laundry room, and a truck wash — so drivers wouldn't have to do errands in the precious hours they have at home with their families.\n\nWhen we poked our heads in around 2 p.m., there was no one in the 60-seat theatre. Disney's \"Cars\" played to an empty room.\n\nSeeing the movie selection gave me a jolt of excitement and nostalgia. It felt like I was a kid again, looking at that cool friend's massive collection of DVDs. I wanted more than anything to stay and cozy up to a movie.\n\nIt struck me that if a trucker has a toothache, they can't pull their rig into a neighborhood dentist. Which is why a dentist at a truck stop could be so valuable.\n\nI didn't get a chance to talk to the chiropractor, but Lee told me that many drivers experience back pain from being seated for 10 hours a day.\n\nTruckers can get new headlights, fenders, hood ornaments, seats, electronics, and horns. Iowa 80 also has a Truck Service Center that can repair any semi.\n\nAnd for drivers who might need inspiration for decorating their vehicle, there's even a trucking museum on the property, featuring over 100 antique rigs on display.\n\nDrivers told me that just to get some sleep, they have to fight for a parking spot at the most common truck stops, like TA and Pilot, but after 7 p.m. or 8 p.m., it's impossible to find one.\n\nThat's why you'll sometimes see rigs pulled over on the shoulder of a highway onramp to sleep, which can be unsafe if there's heavy traffic.\n\nEven with hundreds of trucks settled in by the time we left at 5 p.m., the lot was nowhere near full. I can see why this is an important feature for tired drivers.",

(WAVY) — Thumbing through pictures on his cell phone, Takari Mason appeared disappointed. “I wish that I had taken more pictures with my brother,” that’s what Mason said three days after his brother, 31-year-old Dewand McGowan was shot and killed at the Wendy’s fast food restaurant in the 1400 block of Warwick Blvd.\n\nMan shot and killed at Newport News Wendy’s\n\nWhen asked if he could think of anyone who would want to hurt his brother, Takari Mason said, “I couldn’t even think of nobody. They. Everybody loved (him). I don’t know about no enemies. I’ve never heard about nobody not liking them. None of that. Really, I have no idea.\n\nAbout four hours before closing time Tuesday night, someone shot and killed McGowan who was a Wendy’s manager. The next morning, crews were still on the scene cleaning the building. \nTwo years ago, the brothers’ mother, Kyna McGowan was shot and killed on Madison Avenue in Newport News.\n\n“She got killed in [an]argument. The lady shot her in the face. This happened when I was incarcerated, so I couldn’t even be there to morally support [the family],” said Mason.\n\n“I tried everything I could, to keep him involved in his and nieces lives. It was never no bad words between us. It was always good memories,” Mason said. “He was loved by many. He was loved by many. But more than I even knew. Now that I see it, he’s gone. It’s a lot more people than I thought. His death really shook the city.”\n\nThe owners of the fast food restaurant issued a statement to the news media.\n\nWe are deeply saddened by this tragic incident. The safety and well‑being of our team and customers remain our top priorities. We are cooperating fully with local law enforcement and are focused on providing counseling and support services to our team members during this time.",

I’ve gone for this one, however, which lets everyone pick a cake to play as before competing in food fights and taking on mini-games such as roasting marshmallows and lobbing fruit into a pie. If you ever wished that the Great British Bake Off was ever-so-slightly more gladitorial, this is the game for you.\n\nEver wanted to use a friend or family member as a makeshift bridge to navigate a ravine? Now – finally! – is your chance. Heave Ho is a puzzle platformer in which up to four players take part as stretchy creatures navigating increasingly complex and deadly levels by pulling, throwing and expanding each other in ridiculous ways. Communication and experimentation are important – as is not getting too annoyed when Uncle Kevin accidentally catapults you to your certain doom.\n\nThe latest in the long series of excellent quiz games returns for its 11th outing, allowing up to eight players to compete in a series of themed rounds involving doodling, making sound effects and, of course, trivia. Participants will need to be quiet (ie sober) enough to concentrate on the rules of each game, so maybe start the evening with this one.\n\nWhere would Christmas be without karaoke? It doesn’t bear thinking about. Let’s Sing 2026 comes with 35 hits from the likes of Chappell Roan, Lola Young and Lewis Capaldi, but you also get a month’s free access to the game’s online jukebox where you’ll find hundreds more, including lots of classics. You can buy a bundle pack with two USB microphones or download an app that lets you use your phone as a mic. Alternatively, Just Dance 2026 Edition is energetic and hilarious, but requires more room and coordination – it’s all fun and games until someone moonwalks into your Ming dynasty vase.\n\nFor those weird families who prefer cooperation to competition, here’s a gorgeous shooter for up to four players in which everyone works together to keep a spaceship functioning, each player racing between different stations to fire at enemies, repair damage and charge shields. If you’ve ever wanted to shout “protect the hyperdrive!” at your nan, now is your chance.\n\nThe ultimate accessible driving game, featuring simple (yet deep) controls, fun characters and crazy circuits, all within an explorable open-world map. The presence of weapons such as homing missile shells means even complete newcomers have a chance to win, but the real victory is the utter chaos you cause along the way. If you don’t yet have a Switch 2, Mario Kart 8 works just as well.\n\nIf you’re looking to experience the sheer fun of moving house without the expense or inconvenience, this is the co-op puzzle game for you. You play as a removal firm, carefully working together to carry sofas, tables and other fragile household items to your truck, as quickly as possible without smashing anything. I give it three minutes before every Friends fan in your house is shouting “pivot!!”\n\nPerfectly described by the developer as, “a cooperative shouting game”, SpaceTeam allows up to eight players (each with a copy of the game on their phone) to cosplay as the bridge crew of a malfunctioning star craft, yelling orders at each other according to onscreen prompts. It’s loud and hilarious and will fit the mood of any raucous Christmas Eve get-together.",

    "description": "From crinkled chocolate chip to oatmeal chocolate chunk, I tried four of Ina Garten's cookie recipes and ranked them from from worst to best.",
    "fullText": "When it comes to cooking and baking, there's rarely an Ina Garten recipe I don't like.\n\nHer recipes are reliable, and there's something for everyone to enjoy. So, I decided to bake my way through four of her cookie recipes to see how they compare.\n\nFor a mix of classic, chocolate, and fruity flavors, I went with her giant crinkled chocolate chip cookies, raspberry jam thumbprints, white-chocolate chunk cookies, and salty oatmeal chocolate-chunk cookies.\n\nHere's how they stacked up, from worst to best.\n\nTo make 12 of Garten's giant crinkled chocolate chip cookies, I gathered:\n\nMaking the dough was a pretty straightforward process. I mixed everything in an electric mixer, folded in the chocolate chunks, and let it chill for 30 minutes. Then, I was ready to bake.\n\nAlthough these have the word \"giant\" in the name of the recipe, I didn't expect the cookies to be as massive as they were. Each one used a whopping ⅓ cup of dough, and they spread a lot, so I needed to cook them in batches.\n\nAfter baking for 10 minutes, the instructions said to pull the tray out and bang it on the counter. This was repeated every three minutes until the cookies were done baking to create the crinkle effect. However, this method became a little tedious after baking multiple trays.\n\nFor a smoother process, I also recommend baking on parchment paper. I didn't do this with the first batch, and even with cooking spray, mine stuck to the tray pretty badly since they had thinned out so much.\n\nThese cookies were good, but I wanted to like them more. They came out thin, buttery, and crispy, but were not the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had.\n\nHowever, I do prefer a more chewy cookie, so it's all up to personal preference. They look rather impressive, but these are the kind of treat I would need to fully commit time and dedication to making. For that reason, they landed in fourth place.\n\nTo make 32 of Garten's raspberry jam thumbprint cookies, I grabbed:\n\nI started by making the dough in an electric mixer, using the butter, sugar, vanilla, flour, and salt.\n\nThen, I dumped it out onto a clean surface and kneaded it lightly to incorporate some of the looser bits. The texture reminded me of a shortbread cookie.\n\nAfter wrapping the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerating it for 30 minutes, I began forming the cookies.\n\nI shaped each ball, dipped it in egg wash, and rolled it in shredded coconut. Then, I pressed a thumbprint into the dough, filled it with jam, and baked.\n\nThese cookies came out delicious. The coconut got nice and toasty, and the raspberry jam was the perfect sweet flavor to balance out the buttery, crumbly shortbread.\n\nI used raspberry jam for this batch, but I could see myself making them again and experimenting with different flavors, like apricot, strawberry, and even cherry. Overall, these were a solid third-place choice.\n\nTo make 40 of Garten's chocolate white-chocolate chunk cookies, I gathered:\n\nThe dough for these cookies — which was made with butter, both sugars, vanilla, eggs, cocoa, flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and white chocolate — came together easily in the mixer in under 10 minutes.\n\nIn her recipe, Garten emphasizes the importance of a precise 15-minute bake time. The recipe states that the cookies may seem underdone when they come out, but that's what helps perfect the chewy texture.\n\nI let them cool for a few minutes to firm up before moving them to a separate plate.\n\nI'm not usually one to reach for a chocolate cookie, but this recipe changed that. These came out soft, rich, and chewy, with a brownie-like fudginess.\n\nThe combination of rich chocolate dough and chunks of white chocolate was so good that I would reach for these cookies over and over again. So, they came in second place.\n\nThe recipe for these cookies was straightforward to follow.\n\nI creamed the butter and sugars and added the dry ingredients. Then, I folded in the dried cranberries and chocolate chunks and baked for 10 minutes.\n\nI appreciated that there were no complicated steps and the dough didn't need to be refrigerated.",

    "fullText": "Keir Starmer’s office claims UK still in ‘active conversations’ about deal for tech industries in both countries to cooperate\n\nDowning Street insists the $40bn Tech Prosperity Deal between the US and UK that is on hold is not permanently stalled. The BBC reported on Tuesday evening that the prime minister’s office claimed that the UK remains in “active conversations with US counterparts at all levels of government” about the wide-ranging deal for the technology industries in both countries to cooperate.\n\nThe agreement, previously billed as historic, was paused after the US accused the UK of failing to lower trade barriers, including a digital services tax on US tech companies and food safety rules that limit the export of some agricultural products. The New York Times first reported British confirmation that negotiations had stalled.\n\n“We look forward to resuming work on this partnership as quickly as possible,” a Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement. She added that the UK government is committed to ensuring a “bond” with the US “and working together to help shape the emerging technologies of the future”.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTuesday’s developments come as relations between the US and the EU are likewise chilling. The Trump administration threatened European tech firms on Tuesday with economic penalties if the EU refused to roll back what it called “discriminatory actions”. The Office of the US Trade Representative accused the EU and some member states of “discriminatory and harassing lawsuits, taxes, fines and directives against U.S. services”.\n\nThe Trade Representative’s office said in a post on Twitter/X that these companies could face fees and restrictions on foreign services. The bureau singled out European companies, including Accenture, DHL, Spotify and Siemens as being able to “operate freely in the United States for decades, benefitting from access to our market and consumers on a level playing field.\n\n“If the E.U. and E.U. Member States insist on continuing to restrict, limit, and deter the competitiveness of U.S. service providers through discriminatory means, the United States will have no choice but to begin using every tool at its disposal to counter these unreasonable measures,” the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said on X.\n\nThomas Regnier, a spokesperson for the European Commission, responded by stressing that their rules “apply equally and fairly to all companies” operating in the region, according to the New York Times. “We will continue to enforce our rules fairly, and without discrimination,” he said.\n\nThe retaliation by the US follows a $140m fine slapped on Elon Musk’s X social media platform for violating transparency rules under the Digital Services Act. EU regulators took issue with the “deceptive design of X’s ‘blue checkmark’,” “lack of transparency of X’s ads repository” and “failure to provide researchers access to public data”. The EU has proven much more willing than the US to regulate, investigate and penalize tech giants, a point of contention with the Trump administration.",

    "description": "Ina Garten's ravioli en brodo is a delicious Italian twist on chicken noodle soup. It's one of the best Barefoot Contessa recipes I've ever made.",
    "fullText": "Ravioli en brodo appears in Garten's most recent cookbook, \"Go-To Dinners.\" She said the key to its flavor is \"rich homemade chicken stock.\"\n\nI usually take the quicker option because, as the Barefoot Contessa herself says, \"store-bought is fine!\" But since the broth is clearly the star of this dish, I decided to try her homemade chicken stock instead.\n\nTo make Garten's homemade chicken stock, you'll need:\n\nPlace all the ingredients in a 16- to 20-quart stockpot, add 7 quarts of water, and bring to a boil. Then, lower the heat and simmer your stock uncovered, skimming off any foam that comes to the top, for at least four hours. (I let it simmer for about six.)\n\nLet the stock cool, then strain through a colander and discard the solids.\n\nTo make Garten's ravioli en brodo for a serving of 4-6, you'll need:\n\nI chopped the onions, peeled and sliced the carrots, and diced the celery and fennel.\n\nI added ¼ cup of olive oil to a pot placed over medium heat. Then, I threw in the onions, celery, carrots, and fennel and cooked them for 15 minutes, making sure to stir occasionally until they had softened.\n\nI also threw in 2 cups of water, per Garten's instructions.\n\nOne thing I've learned in my soup-making season is that a Parmesan rind can add so much extra flavor to your broth.\n\nAs explained by Food & Wine, the Parmesan rind — which is completely edible — releases a \"savory and nutty\" depth as it begins to melt and also helps give soups a \"silky consistency.\"\n\nYou can store Parmesan rinds in a Ziploc bag in your freezer for up to a year, so it's always on hand whenever you need to add a little more umami to your dinner.\n\nGarten says you should let the soup simmer partially uncovered.\n\nI grated my Parmesan cheese and minced some dill for the soup toppings.\n\nI cooked my ravioli in a pot of boiling water with two tablespoons of salt for about four minutes.\n\nEvery pasta is different, so make sure to follow the specific directions on the package of your ravioli.\n\nI started with four raviolis but quickly realized I wanted more.\n\nThere's something about this soup that just looks so elegant and impressive. The broth has such a lovely golden hue, and the pops of color from the carrots and dill give it a rustic charm.\n\nAnd did I mention it smelled phenomenal?\n\nI've made nearly 50 Barefoot Contessa dishes over the past few years, and her ravioli en brodo soup is one of the best. The broth is so rich and full-bodied that it really blew me away. I made this for my fiancé for dinner one night, and he couldn't resist getting seconds (and thirds).\n\n\"A lot of broths are kind of bland or lacking, but this broth alone was just exploding with flavor,\" he told me.\n\nThe dill and lemon also add some lovely brightness to the soup, which pairs perfectly with the cheesy pasta. I opted for a cacio e pepe ravioli and would highly recommend it, as I loved that extra kick of pepper.\n\nMy only complaint about Garten's ravioli en brodo is that it has forever ruined store-bought chicken stock for me. However, an extra day of work is absolutely worth it for this soup, which I know I'll be making again and again.",

    "fullText": "AI Mode is mangling recipes by merging instructions from multiple creators – and causing them huge dips in ad traffic\n\nThis past March, when Google began rolling out its AI Mode search capability, it began offering AI-generated recipes. The recipes were not all that intelligent. The AI had taken elements of similar recipes from multiple creators and Frankensteined them into something barely recognizable. In one memorable case, the Google AI failed to distinguish the satirical website the Onion from legitimate recipe sites and advised users to cook with non-toxic glue.\n\nOver the past few years, bloggers who have not secured their sites behind a paywall have seen their carefully developed and tested recipes show up, often without attribution and in a bastardized form, in ChatGPT replies. They have seen dumbed-down versions of their recipes in AI-assembled cookbooks available for digital downloads on Etsy or on AI-built websites that bear a superficial resemblance to an old-school human-written blog. Their photos and videos, meanwhile, are repurposed in Facebook posts and Pinterest pins that link back to this digital slop.\n\nRecipe writers have no legal recourse because recipes generally are not copyrightable. Although copyright protects published or recorded work, they do not cover sets of instructions (although it can apply to the particular wording of those instructions).\n\nWithout this essential IP, many food bloggers earn their living by offering their work for free while using ads to make money. But now they fear that casual users who rely on search engines or social media to find a recipe for dinner will conflate their work with AI slop and stop trusting online recipe sites altogether.\n\n“There are a lot of people that are scared to even talk about what’s going on because it is their livelihood,” says Jim Delmage who, with his wife, Tara, runs the blog and YouTube channel Sip and Feast.\n\nMatt Rodbard, the founder and editor-in-chief of the website Taste, is even more pessimistic. Taste used to publish recipes more frequently, but now it mostly focuses on journalism and a podcast (which Rodbard hosts). “For websites that depend on the advertising model,” he says, “I think this is an extinction event in many ways.”\n\nThe holiday season is traditionally when food bloggers earn most of their ad revenue. For many, this year has been slower than usual. One blogger, Carrie Forrest of Clean Eating Kitchen, told Bloomberg that in the past two years, she has lost 80% of her traffic.\n\nOthers, like Delmage and Karen Tedesco, the author of the blog Familystyle Food, say their numbers, and ad revenue, have remained steady – so far. They attribute this to focusing their energies less on trying to game the search engines than on the long-term goal of attracting regular followers – and, in Delmage’s case, viewers.\n\nTedesco’s strategy has been to create recipes that rely on her experience and technical knowhow honed by years in restaurant kitchens and as a personal chef. Her Italian meatball recipe, for example, based on her mother’s, includes advice about which meat to use, an explanation of why milk-soaked breadcrumbs are essential for texture, and a dozen process photos and a video.\n\nBut she is still worried about the potential impact of AI. When she recently did a Google search for “Italian meatballs”, Familystyle Food appeared as the top result. Then she switched to AI Mode. There, she found the recipe had been Frankensteined – or “synthesized” as Gemini put it – into a new recipe with nine other sources (including Sip and Feast and a Washington Post recipe for Greek meatballs). The AI-generated recipe was little more than a list of ingredients and six basic steps with none of the details that make Tedesco’s recipe unique.\n\nAI Mode linked to all 10 recipes, including Tedesco’s, but, she says, “I don’t think many people are actually clicking on the source links. At this point, they’re absolutely trusting in the results that are getting thrown in their faces.”\n\nOther bloggers have seen a more definite impact on their viewership. Adam Gallagher, who runs Inspired Taste with his wife, Joanne, and who has become an outspoken critic of AI on social media, told the podcast Marketing O’Clock that since spring, he has noticed that while the number of times viewers saw links to the site on Google has increased, the number of actual site visitors has decreased. This indicates, to him, that users are satisfied with the search engine’s AI interpretation of Inspired Taste’s recipes.\n\nAfter the Gallaghers posted about the discrepancy on X and Instagram, a number of readers replied to say they had not realized there was a difference between the recipes on the blog and the version that showed up in Google searches. They had just appreciated the convenience of not having to click on another website, especially when Google’s page design was so clean and uncluttered.\n\nRodbard acknowledges that many food blogs have gotten ugly and overloaded with ads, which has exacerbated the problem. “Ad tech on these recipe blogs has gotten so bad, so many pop-up windows and so much crashing, we kind of lost as publishers,” he says.\n\nAccording to Tom Critchlow, the EVP of audience growth at Raptive, a media company that works with many food bloggers to find advertisers, it isn’t ads that are driving viewers away. It’s Google itself, with its changes to the algorithm and now with AI Mode, that’s making the sites harder to find.\n\nThere is some hope though: a survey of 3,000 US adults commissioned by Raptive showed that the more interaction people had with AI, the less they wanted to engage with it, and nearly half the respondents rated AI content less trustworthy than content made by a human.\n\nBut unless the public rebels against AI Mode, there is only so much bloggers can do. They can block OpenAI’s training crawler, which gathers information that ChatGPT uses to create content, including its own recipe generator, but theyare not necessarily willing to make themselves invisible to web searches; as Delmage puts it: “You can’t bite the hand that feeds you.”\n\nThere is also the option of moving over to a subscription model, such as Substack or Patreon, and keeping the recipes behind a paywall, but both Tedesco and Delmage point out that the most successful Substackers, like Caroline Chambers or David Lebovitz, came to the platform with much more substantial followings than they have. “If I were to give up my website or even try to go over to Substack, I would be broke,” Tedesco says.\n\nRodbard suggests that the analog version of the recipe blog, the cookbook, might be due for a comeback. Cookbooks, after all, offer the same experience of spending time and learning from a trusted source, and it’s likely the recipes have been tested. As a bonus, unlike phones or laptops, they don’t go dark when you neglect them for too long and you can splash tomato sauce on them without inflicting permanent damage. According to the market research firm Circana (formerly BookScan), sales of baking cookbooks are up 80% this year, but other areas have been relatively flat.\n\nBut AI bots are stealing from published cookbooks, too. When Meta was training its own AI, it compiled thousands of books into a dataset called Library Genesis (LibGen). Now unscrupulous publishers have raided LibGen and repackaged some of the books into dupes, which they are selling on Amazon.\n\nAs more people become aware of the amount of AI slop on the internet and how to identify it, Critchlow believes they will develop a greater appreciation for content produced by humans. “People will ultimately place a higher premium on being able to know that these recipes have been tested and made by somebody that I follow or somebody I respect or somebody that I like,” he says.\n\nThe recipe creators themselves are not so sure. “I’m putting my faith in that there’s always going to be a segment of people who really want to learn something,” Tedesco says. But as for the business of blogging itself, “it’s like a rolling tide. It’s always up and down and you have to roll with it and adapt.”",

    "description": "A Business Insider reporter taste-tested Ina Garten and Martha Stewart's latke recipes for Hanukkah to compare the two celebrity chefs' recipes.",
    "fullText": "The recipe lists potatoes, an egg, flour, salt, and pepper.\n\nI was surprised to find that the recipe called for frying the latkes in clarified butter, rather than oil. Eating foods fried in oil is part of Hanukkah tradition, so I was a bit skeptical about this change.\n\nI managed to cut myself almost immediately. Grate with caution.\n\nThe resulting batter had the consistency of oatmeal.\n\nThe recipe includes instructions for how to make clarified butter. You can also just buy ghee at a grocery store and skip this step.\n\nThe process reminded me of skimming the fat off the top of chicken soup. It was easy, but it took extra time waiting for the solids to settle.\n\nGarten's recipe instructs using a tablespoon of the potato mixture for each latke.\n\nI also loved that frying the latkes in butter didn't make my entire apartment and person smell like oil. It's a strong scent that tends to linger. These just smelled mildly like melted butter, which was amazing.\n\nSince no additional ingredients were added to the batter, the potato flavor shone through, and the buttery crust was delicious.\n\nIt didn't have the oily taste of a traditional latke, but I actually preferred the milder taste of butter.\n\nStewart's recipe involved twice the amount of potatoes and eggs that were in Garten's, as well as additions like grated onion and beer.\n\nStewart's recipe says to reserve this potato juice, let the milky starch sink to the bottom, and pour off the liquid — similar to the clarified butter I made for Garten's recipe.\n\nGrated onions are standard in latke recipes — beer, not as much. I was curious to see how it would affect the flavor and texture.\n\nThe larger latkes took much longer to fry than Garten's, and they were a little more unruly to flip. I'm still trying to get a resulting oil splash out of my favorite jeans.\n\nI could already tell that these latkes were going to be the more traditional of the two.\n\nI couldn't taste the beer, but the grated onion and the crispy, oily goodness created a sharper flavor that screamed Hanukkah to me.\n\nEven though they're not fried in oil — which is kind of the point of eating them on this holiday — I enjoyed Garten's latkes more because they were easier and faster to make, and they had a mild, buttery flavor that I loved. Stewart's recipe, however, is perfect for traditionalists.",

    "title": "The One Food an Endocrinologist Is Begging People Over 50 To Add to Their Diet",
    "description": "An expert shares why he wants everyone 50 and older to eat it every day.",
    "fullText": "Trying to hit every single one of your nutrient goals can feel overwhelming. Getting enough protein, fiber, calcium…there’s a lot to keep track of. This can be even more challenging if you’re trying to maintain a calorie deficit in an effort to lose weight in a healthy way.\n\nThis is where foods that provide multiple nutrients can be especially beneficial. Take beans, for example. This one food can help you work toward your protein and fiber goals. Beans are also a great source of iron, magnesium, potassium, zinc and B vitamins. Salmon is another great multitasking food for meeting your nutrient needs. This fatty fish is a great source of protein, omega-3 fatty acids and calcium.  \n\nThen, there’s one super nutrient-rich food that often flies under the radar, but adding it to your diet can benefit health in several major ways, especially if you’re 50 or older.\n\nOne food that is often misunderstood is eggs. \n\n“Eggs get more unwarranted criticism than almost any other everyday food,” says Dr. David Ahn, MD, an endocrinologist specializing in diabetes and metabolism and the Chief of Diabetes Services at Hoag.\n\nMany people 50 and older believe that eggs are detrimental to heart health, but Dr. Ahn says that this isn’t the case, as long as they are eaten in moderation. “The data is surprisingly consistent. For most adults, including people over 50, moderate egg intake—which is around one egg per day—is not associated with an increased risk of heart attack, stroke or overall cardiac disease. In fact, studies of some populations, such as Asians and Asian Americans, have found that moderate egg consumption is associated with slightly lower risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke,” Dr. Ahn says.\n\nEven if you have diabetes or a genetic cholesterol disorder, Dr. Ahn explains that eating one egg a day is typically safe to eat, though he recommends checking with your doctor or a registered dietitian for dietary advice tailored to your individual health needs.\n\nWhat about eating two or three eggs a day? Unless you have hypertension and as long as the rest of your diet is low in saturated fat, it’s likely still okay. According to a 2025 scientific study published in Proceedings of the NutritionSociety, eating two eggs a day didn’t raise LDL cholesterol as long as one’s overall diet was low in saturated fat.\n\n🩺\nThere are several ways that eating eggs regularly supports healthy aging. Dr. Ahn says that one reason is that they help keep blood sugar levels steady. “Eggs check all the ‘it food’ boxes. They’re low in carbs, rich in protein and a good source of beneficial fats. This means that, on their own, they can help increase satiety, or the sensation of fullness, while maintaining steady blood sugar levels,” he says.\n\nDr. Ahn explains that maintaining stable blood sugar levels is especially important for people with diabetes because uncontrolled blood sugar can lead to organ damage over time, adding, “Even if you don’t have diabetes, it is a good idea to maintain a steady blood sugar level to reduce inflammation in blood vessels and keep your heart and cardiovascular system healthy over time.”\n\nHe says that steady blood sugar is also one of the key drivers of maintaining healthy weight because it reduces energy crashes and cravings. This means eggs are a great food to incorporate into your diet if you’re trying to lose weight.\n\nEggs also contain several nutrients that support brain health. Dr. Ahn explains that they’re one of the top sources of choline, a nutrient your brain uses to build healthy cells and make acetylcholine, a key memory neurotransmitter. “People who get enough choline tend to do better on cognitive tests as they age. So while no single food can prevent dementia, eggs can absolutely support long-term brain health,” he says.\n\nDr. Ahn says that choline also supports vision health and he adds that eggs also contain lutein and zeaxanthin, two crucial nutrients for maintaining healthy vision as we age. “Lutein and zeaxanthin have been found to reduce the risk of macular degeneration in older adults, the leading cause of vision loss in people 60 and older,” he says.\n\nAs you can see, eggs contain a wealth of nutritional benefits that are especially supportive when it comes to healthy aging. This relatively inexpensive food is super versatile too. Besides being a breakfast staple, you can incorporate a hard-boiled egg into salads or soups, scramble one into rice-based dishes or bake egg muffins to have on hand for a nutrient-rich snack.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? When it comes to reaping eggs’ health benefits, it’s time to get cracking!\n\nDr. David Ahn, MD, endocrinologist specializing in diabetes and metabolism and the Chief of Diabetes Services at Hoag\n\nDrouin-Chartier, J.P., Chen, S., Li, Y., et al.

    "description": "Snacking on junk food can disrupt your diet even if you eat healthy meals. A nutritionist recommends her favorite healthy snacks for lasting energy.",
    "fullText": "Eating more snacks can make it easier to stay on track with a healthy diet, according to a top nutritionist — if you pick the right kind of snacks.\n\nResearcher Federica Amati said smart snacking has been a game-changer for her personal eating habits on a busy schedule.\n\n\"If I've got a really busy day, sometimes I don't get time to have a proper lunch. If I have these snacks with me, I'm good and I'm feeling good. If I don't, then I'm ravenous later,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nAmati, medical scientist and head nutritionist at the nutrition app ZOE, has also seen the power of snacking first-hand in her work.\n\nEven if you're careful with most of your diet, snacking on junk food can leave you struggling with metabolic health issues like weight gain, low energy, high cholesterol and high blood sugar, she said. That's backed up by research from ZOE and other experts.\n\n\"Crappy snacks can basically outdo a lot of the greatness you are doing for yourself with good food,\" Amati said. \"Snacking per se isn't good or bad for you, but what you snack on has a massive influence on your metabolic health.\"\n\nShe shared the two foods she always carries for a nutrient-dense boost, and how to optimize your snacking routine for a healthier diet.\n\nAmati's go-to snack combination at work is an apple and a small jar of mixed nuts.\n\nThe pairing of fruit and nuts offers gut-healthy fiber, plant-based protein, and healthy fats — all satiating nutrients that tell your brain you're full.\n\n\"It doesn't have to be some sort of chef situation,\" Amati said.\"It's just about having a very different mentality to snacking. If you are hungry, eat something that's a food.\"\n\nWhat's key is that you reach for whole foods. If you snack on ultra-processed foods, like a granola bar loaded with additives like sugar, fat, and salt, it's easy to overeat.\n\nWhy? Because the nutrients in ultra-processed foods are already broken down, leaving you with less to digest. So, they offer a temporary energy fix but leave you crashing afterward, often leading to overindulgence at your next meal or snack.\n\n\"It's nutritionally pretty void. So though you may temporarily not be so ravenous, your body's not benefiting from it, and your hunger will remain later that day,\" Amati said.\n\nPlus, the benefit of Amati's fruit-and-nuts snack is that it's relatively inexpensive and requires zero prep: just grab and go.\n\nThe specifics aren't crucial — you can make a healthy snack from fruits like berries and other nuts and seeds, from almonds to pepitas.\n\nWhatever you choose to snack on, being proactive about your hunger cues can lead to better results, according to Amati.\n\nEating early helps you stay in tune with your circadian rhythm to feel consistently energized and make better choices throughout the day.\n\n\"We're primed to more efficiently deal with nutrients and with energy storage and distribution from fats or sugars at the beginning of the day,\" she said.\n\nSkimping on early meals and snacks can leave you so hungry by dinner that you double-down on dessert or late-night snacking, often with less-healthy choices.\n\nWhile timing your snacks can be a matter of personal preference, eating when you're hungry but not hangry can stave off temptations for a more balanced diet.\n\n\"You'd be surprised how many people who struggle with their weight or who struggle with poor metabolic health don't eat enough during the day,\" Amati said.",

    "title": "Will blockbuster obesity drugs revolutionize addiction treatment?",
    "description": "Scientists are testing whether GLP-1 drugs can help to cut cravings for cigarettes, alcohol and opioids — as well as food.",
    "fullText": "Last April, neuroscientist Sue Grigson received an e-mail from a man detailing his years-long struggle to kick addiction — first to opioids, and then to the very medication meant to help him quit.\n\nThe man had stumbled on research by Grigson, suggesting that certain anti-obesity medications could help to reduce rats’ addiction to drugs such as heroin and fentanyl. He decided to try quitting again, this time while taking semaglutide, the blockbuster GLP-1 drug better known as Ozempic. “That’s when he wrote to me,” says Grigson, who works at Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine in Hershey. “He said that he was drug- and alcohol-free for the first time in his adult life.”\n\nStories like this have been spreading fast in the past few years, through online forums, weight-loss clinics and news headlines. They describe people taking diabetes and weight-loss drugs such as semaglutide (also marketed as Wegovy) and tirzepatide (sold as Mounjaro or Zepbound) who find themselves suddenly able to shake long-standing addictions to cigarettes, alcohol and other drugs. And now, clinical data are starting to back them up.\n\nEarlier this year, a team led by Christian Hendershot, a psychologist now at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, reported in a landmark randomized trial that weekly injections of semaglutide cut alcohol consumption1 — a key demonstration that GLP-1 drugs can alter addictive behaviour in people with a substance-use disorder. More than a dozen randomized clinical studies testing GLP-1 drugs for addiction are now under way worldwide, with some results expected in the next few months.\n\nNeuroscientists, meanwhile, are working out how the weight-loss drugs suppress addiction by acting on hormone receptors in brain regions that control craving, reward and motivation. They are finding that GLP-1 therapies help to blunt urges for alcohol, opioids, nicotine and cocaine through some of the same brain pathways that also quell hunger cues and overeating. “At the end of the day, the neurobiological system that is activated by rewarding substances — food, sex, drugs, rock and roll — it’s the same system,” says Roger McIntyre, a psychopharmacologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. And some researchers are testing whether, by influencing reward-related brain circuits, the drugs might help with dementia and depression as well.\n\nThe research is still in its early stages, scientists warn. “We first need to find out if it’s efficacious and safe,” says W. Kyle Simmons, a neuroimaging specialist at Oklahoma State University in Tulsa, who is leading a GLP-1 trial for alcohol reduction.\n\nBut some researchers and physicians are excited. No truly new class of addiction medicine has won approval from regulators in decades, says Elisabet Jerlhag Holm, an addiction biologist at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. If GLP-1 drugs prove effective in bigger trials, she says, “it’s a revolution”.\n\nIt took some years for the current buzz around GLP-1 drugs in addiction medicine to build. Researchers originally developed them to control blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes by mimicking the hormone GLP-1. Soon it became clear that the drugs could curb appetite and promote weight loss, too. They act on hormone receptors located in the pancreas and gut — where they help to regulate blood sugar and signal fullness — but also in key regions of the brain that control reward and motivation, dialling down the urge for tasty, calorie-laden food.\n\nYet her findings barely registered among addiction researchers, she says, and pharmaceutical companies showed no interest either. “I was quite alone for a long time,” says Jerlhag Holm.\n\nBut Lorenzo Leggio, a physician-scientist at the US National Institutes of Health in Baltimore, Maryland, noticed the work. He had also been following clues that GLP-1 might influence addictive behaviour and, in 2015, joined forces with Jerlhag Holm to uncover the first evidence of a connection between the hormone and alcohol dependence in humans. The team found that a common variant of the GLP-1 receptor gene was linked to heavier drinking6.\n\nUsing post-mortem human brain tissue, Leggio’s lab later showed that people with alcohol-use disorder have elevated levels of GLP-1 receptors in key reward-related regions of the brain7. Leggio suspects that this reflects an adaptive response: alcohol dampens the body’s GLP-1 production, and so the brain boosts expression of the hormone’s receptors to preserve sensitivity to it in circuits that govern reward and motivation.\n\nThese results, together with a growing number of animal studies, solidified GLP-1’s connection to addictive behaviour. Yet it was not until May 2023 that the story spilled into the public eye. The Atlantic magazine published an article about people taking semaglutide who said their urge to smoke or drink had faded. ‘Did Scientists Accidentally Invent an Anti-addiction Drug?’ it was headlined. “That was definitely a turning point,” says Leggio, who suddenly found himself getting calls from journalists.\n\nThe first few rigorous trials, however, had largely disappointing results. A 2022 study in Denmark, led by psychiatrist Anders Fink-Jensen at the University of Copenhagen, found that weekly treatment with exenatide — a ‘first-generation’ GLP-1 compound used since 2005 to treat diabetes but never approved for weight loss — did not substantially reduce the number of heavy drinking days in people diagnosed with alcohol dependence8. A 2023 trial in Switzerland likewise found that dulaglutide, another older GLP-1 drug, did not help people to quit smoking9.\n\nBut other results suggested that the drugs might have an effect. In a trial10 involving 20 people with opioid-use disorder, led by Grigson and psychologist Scott Bunce, also at Pennsylvania State University, treatment with liraglutide — another first-generation GLP-1 drug — reduced opioid craving by roughly 40%. And when Fink-Jensen’s team used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to look at the brains of people taking exenatide in their clinical trial, they saw muted activity in reward-related regions when the participants viewed images of alcoholic drinks8.\n\nBut the first-generation drugs tested in these preliminary studies are much less potent than agents such as semaglutide or tirzepatide. These second-generation compounds bind more tightly to the GLP-1 receptor, stay active in the body for longer and have shown greater benefits across a range of health conditions. So, could these latest drugs change the behaviour of people struggling with substance misuse?\n\nThat’s what researchers are now examining in a raft of clinical trials with hotly anticipated results. Fink-Jensen and his colleagues have already tested whether the high dose of semaglutide approved for weight loss can cut alcohol intake in 108 people with alcohol-use disorder and obesity, in a clinical trial that wrapped up earlier this year. He says the results should be published in early 2026.\n\nIn the United States, meanwhile, Leggio and Simmons are each leading independent but coordinated randomized trials testing injected semaglutide in moderate-to-heavy drinkers who meet the diagnostic criteria for problematic alcohol use. Leggio’s trial will involve 52 people and test the high-dose Wegovy form of the drug, whereas Simmons’s trial, involving 80 people, is testing the lower-dose Ozempic, typically prescribed for diabetes. And psychologist Joseph Schacht at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora has been running his own alcohol trial with the oral version of semaglutide (marketed as Rybelsus). By coordinating their efforts, the three teams hope to tease apart how differences in dose and delivery affect outcomes.\n\nSchacht says that the pills, although less potent than injections, could be more appealing to people with alcohol addiction, many of whom also have a history of using injectable drugs such as fentanyl. “They can be gun-shy around needles, because that is a cue related to injection drug use,” he says.\n\nIn all of these trials of semaglutide for alcohol dependence, the research teams are also using fMRI to capture before-and-after snapshots of the brain to show how the drug alters responses to alcohol-related prompts, such as drinks or photos. This could reveal whether and how the drug disrupts the brain’s drive for alcohol — the reward-seeking sense of ‘wanting’ that fuels addiction. The imaging results might also show brain activity patterns that are more common in people who benefit from GLP-1 therapy than in those who don’t. “It may give us a better understanding for whom the drug works best,” Simmons says.\n\nResearchers are already piecing together a picture of how GLP-1 drugs act on the brain’s reward system. They know from animal models that rewarding substances — alcohol, nicotine, opioids, food — activate similar neural circuitry. This links deep brain structures such as the ventral tegmental area, where neurons that synthesize the neurotransmitter dopamine originate, to the nucleus accumbens, where dopamine signals arrive and register as pleasure. Normally, every sip, puff or hit sends a jolt of rewarding dopamine through this circuit, teaching the brain to want more and reinforcing addictive behaviour.\n\nGLP-1 receptors sit on neurons throughout this network and, when triggered, are thought to reduce the flow of dopamine and other chemical messages to make rewarding experiences feel less compelling. When drugs such as semaglutide mimic GLP-1, they blunt the dopamine response and the compulsion to repeat the addictive behaviour fades away.\n\nStress responses come into play as well, animal studies show. When drugs activate GLP-1 receptors in brain regions such as the amygdala, they help to mute the surge of stress hormones that accompany anxiety, withdrawal and craving. This dual action — calming both the urge and the unease — could help to explain why the therapies seem to reduce not only consumption but also relapse, at least in rodents.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-03911-x\n\nHendershot, C.

    "description": "A Kentucky food delivery driver faces felony charges after doorbell video allegedly showed her pepper spraying a Vanderburgh County couple's meal.",
    "fullText": "EVANSVILLE — Kentucky authorities arrested a former DoorDash delivery driver Friday who made national news for allegedly contaminating a Vanderburgh County couple’s meal with pepper spray..\n\nThe McCracken County Sheriff's Office arrested the woman, identified in court records as 29-year-old Kourtney N. Stevenson, Friday morning on an Indiana arrest warrant. She faces two counts of battery resulting in moderate injury and two counts of consumer product tampering for the Dec. 7 incident, which was captured in a now-viral doorbell camera video.\n\nStevenson, who has since been dropped by the food delivery service DoorDash, is being held in Kentucky without bond pending extradition proceedings, according to Vanderburgh County Sheriff Noah Robinson.\n\nThe investigation that would lead to Stevenon’s arrest got its start after one of the alleged victims, Mark Cardin, contacted the sheriff's office Dec. 7 to report that he and his wife had fallen ill after eating food delivered to their northern Vanderburgh County home shortly after midnight.\n\nBoth reportedly experienced burning sensations in their mouths, noses, throats and stomachs before vomiting. But the suspected source of their malaise left the couple stunned and furious.\n\n“They reviewed their doorbell camera footage and observed the DoorDash Dasher place the food off camera on the porch and take a picture,” a sheriff’s office news release states. “She then sprayed a substance in the direction of the food from a small aerosol can attached to her keychain and left.”\n\nInvestigators obtained records from DoorDash through a subpoena and identified Stevenson as the driver. Additional investigative work confirmed her identity, and authorities learned she was staying near Paducah, Kentucky.\n\nWhen detectives reached Stevenson by phone, she initially agreed to an interview, telling investigators she had been visiting her father in Evansville and was working DoorDash shifts during her stay. She acknowledged using pepper spray during the delivery but insisted she had sprayed chemical irritant at a spider, not the food, an action she attributed to her intense fear of arachnids.\n\nBut detectives found the explanation dubious. The overnight temperature in Evansville dropped to 35 degrees the night of the incident — conditions under which outdoor spiders in Indiana become inactive and cannot crawl on exposed surfaces, according to the sheriff's office.\n\nStevenson later called back to cancel the scheduled interview.\n\nThe sheriff’s office proceeded with an arrest warrant. Upon Stevenson’s extradition to Indiana, she will be held at the Vanderburgh County jail on a $3,500 bond, court records state. It was not immediately clear how quickly Stevenson would appear before a judge or whether she had retained an attorney.\n\nBattery resulting in moderate injury is a level 6 felony under Indiana law, while consumer product tampering carries more severe penalties as a level 5 felony. Under state guidelines, Level 5 felonies carry a prison sentence of between one and six years, with an advisory sentence 3 years.\n\nDoorDash didn’t wait for Stevenson’s arrest or a conviction to permanently bar her from its platform.\n\n\"DoorDash has absolutely zero tolerance for this type of appalling behavior,\" the company said in a statement to Evansville news media.\n\nRobinson said Vanderburgh County residents “should be able to trust that the food they order for their families is safe.”\n\n\"When someone violates that trust and endangers others, we will respond with urgency and we will pursue charges,” he said. “I want to commend our detectives and also thank the McCracken County Sheriff’s Office and Vanderburgh County Prosecutor’s Office for their assistance in making this arrest.”\n\nHouston Harwood can be contacted at houston.harwood@courierpress.com\n\nThis article originally appeared on Evansville Courier & Press: Arrest made in alleged Indiana DoorDash pepper spray incident",

    "title": "My favorite 5-ingredient pasta sauce is inspired by the Mediterranean diet — plus, it's packed with protein and fiber",
    "description": "After testing homemade pasta sauce recipes, I found a tasty Mediterranean diet-friendly one with fiber, protein, and no ultra-processed ingredients.",
    "fullText": "Pasta with sauce is, and always will be, one of my most beloved comfort meals.\n\nIt's also one of the simplest, speediest, and most satisfying combos in my cooking repertoire, serving as a reliable staple at the end of my busiest days.\n\nBecause I've been trying to reduce the amount of ultra-processed foods in my diet, I've experimented with homemade sauces that are relatively low-effort yet made with entirely whole ingredients.\n\nAfter sampling a range of recipes over the past few months, one flavorful sauce based on a recipe shared by Caroline Hanna, a nutritionist and chef, has emerged as a clear winner.\n\nThe recipe yields four servings, with each containing about 12 grams of protein and 4 grams of fiber. If you have leftover sauce, keep it in a sealed container in the fridge and use it within five days.\n\nYou can pair the sauce with any type of pasta you like. I typically go for a whole-wheat option for added fiber.\n\nBefore the bean-averse shy away from this sauce, let it be known that no one I've made it for has ever guessed they're even an ingredient in this recipe — you really can't taste them.\n\nThe blended beans just contribute to the sauce's smooth, creamy texture.\n\nI love this sauce because it's packed with vegetables, fiber, and protein, but it still tastes as good as (if not better than) any jarred option I've bought in a grocery store.\n\nIt also provides more protein and fiber per serving than most store-bought options I've found.\n\nFor more insights, I asked Nichola Ludlam-Raine, a dietitian and the author of \"How Not to Eat Ultra-Processed,\" to review my recipe. She called the sauce \"brilliantly balanced and nutrient-dense.\"\n\n\"It's rich in fiber, plant-based protein, and micronutrients,\" she said, adding that the fiber in the vegetables and butter beans can help support gut health and make the sauce more filling.\n\nThe dietitian also said this sauce \"aligns with a Mediterranean-style pattern of eating,\" which focuses on fresh produce and plant-based proteins while limiting processed foods.\n\n\"It's packed with antioxidants, especially vitamin C and carotenoids, from the red peppers and tomatoes, and it contains healthy fats from the olive oil, which also helps the body absorb fat-soluble nutrients,\" Ludlam-Raine said.\n\nIf I have a little extra time and energy, I serve my saucy pasta with chicken, green vegetables, and pine nuts.\n\nFor those who want to pack in more fiber, Ludlam-Raine said, you can stir extra vegetables, such as spinach or roasted zucchini, into the sauce.\n\nTo add more protein to the sauce itself, you can swap the ricotta for cottage cheese. Personally, I prefer the taste of ricotta, but both are excellent options.\n\nYou can also use almost any variety of beans in the sauce, though I find butter beans work best. When I used red kidney beans (which you can see in the featured photos), the sauce came out beautifully.\n\n\"Overall, this is exactly the kind of nourishing recipe I encourage people to make,\" Ludlam-Raine said.",

    "fullText": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Rains drenched Gaza’s tent camps and dropping temperatures chilled Palestinians huddling inside them Thursday as winter storm Byron descended on the war-battered territory, showing how two months of a ceasefire have failed to sufficiently address the spiraling humanitarian crisis there.\n\nFamilies found their possessions and food supplies soaked inside their tents. Children’s sandaled feet disappeared under opaque brown water that flooded the camps, running knee deep in some places. Dirt roads turned to mud. Piles of garbage and sewage cascaded like waterfalls.\n\n“We have been drowned. I don’t have clothes to wear and we have no mattresses left,” said Um Salman Abu Qenas, a displaced mother in a Khan Younis tent camp. She said that her family couldn't sleep the night before, because of the water in the tent.\n\nAid groups say not enough shelter materials are getting into Gaza during the truce. Figures recently released by Israel's military suggest it hasn't met the ceasefire stipulation of allowing 600 trucks of aid into Gaza a day, though Israel disputes that finding.\n\n“Cold, overcrowded, and unsanitary environments heighten the risk of illness and infection,” the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said on X. “This suffering could be prevented by unhindered humanitarian aid, including medical support and proper shelter.\"\n\nSabreen Qudeeh, also in the Khan Younis camp, in a squalid area known as Muwasi, said that her family woke up to rain leaking from their tent's ceiling and water from the street soaking their mattresses.\n\n“My little daughters were screaming,” she said.\n\nAhmad Abu Taha, also living in the camp, said there wasn't a tent that escaped the flooding. “Conditions are very bad, we have old people, displaced, and sick people inside this camp,” he said.\n\nFloods in south-central Israel trapped more than a dozen people in their cars, according to Hebrew media. Israel's rescue services, MDA, said that two young girls were slightly injured when a tree fell on their school.\n\nThe contrasting scenes with Gaza made clear how profoundly the Israel-Hamas war had damaged the territory, destroying the majority of homes. Gaza’s population of around 2 million is almost entirely displaced, and most people live in vast tent camps stretching along the coast, or set up among the shells of damaged buildings without adequate flooding infrastructure and with cesspits dug near tents as toilets.\n\nAt least three buildings in Gaza City already damaged by Israeli bombardment during the war partially collapsed under the rain, Palestinian Civil Defense said. It warned people not to stay inside damaged buildings, saying they too could fall down on top of them.\n\nThe agency also said that since the storm began, they have received more than 2,500 distress calls from people across Gaza whose tents and shelters were damaged.\n\nWith buckets and mops, Palestinians laboriously scooped water out of their tents.\n\nAliaa Bahtiti said her 8-year-old son \"was soaked overnight, and in the morning he had turned blue, sleeping on water.” Her tent floor had an inch of water on it “We cannot buy food, covers, towels, or sheets to sleep on.”\n\nBaraka Bhar was caring for her 3-month-old twins inside her tent as the rain poured outside. One of the twins has hydrocephalus, a build-up of fluids in the brain.\n\n“Our tents are worn out ... and they leak rain water,” she said. “We should not lose our children this winter.”\n\nAid groups say that Israel isn't allowing enough aid into Gaza to begin rebuilding the territory after years of war.\n\nUnder the agreement, Israel agreed to comply with aid stipulations from an earlier January truce, which specified that it allow 600 trucks of aid each day into Gaza, It maintains it's doing so, but The Associated Press found that some of its own figures call that into question.\n\nThe January truce also specified that Israel let in a number of caravans and tents. No caravans have yet entered Gaza during the ceasefire, said Tania Hary, executive director of Gisha, an Israeli group advocating for Palestinians’ right to freedom of movement.\n\nThe Israeli military body in charge of coordinating aid to Gaza, called COGAT, said on Dec. 9 it had “lately\" let 260,000 tents and tarpaulins into Gaza and more than 1,500 trucks of blankets and warm clothing.\n\nShelter Cluster, an international coalition of aid providers led by the Norwegian Refugee Council, sets the number lower. It says the U.N. and international nongovernmental organizations have gotten 15,590 tents into Gaza since the truce began, and other countries have sent about 48,000. Many of the tents aren't properly insulated, it says.\n\nAmjad al-Shawa, Gaza chief of the Palestinian NGO Network, told Al Jazeera on Thursday that only a fraction of the 300,000 tents needed had entered Gaza. He said that Palestinians were in dire need of warmer winter clothes and accused Israel of blocking the entry of water pumps to help clear flooded shelters..\n\n\"All international sides should take the responsibility regarding conditions in Gaza,” he said. “There is real danger for people in Gaza at all levels.”\n\nKhaled Mashaal, a Hamas leader, said in an interview with Al Jazeera that Gaza needs the rehabilitation of hospitals, the entry of heavy machinery to remove rubble, and the opening of the Rafah crossing — which remains closed after Israel said last week it would shortly open.\n\nCOGAT didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the claims that Israel wasn’t allowing water pumps or heavy machinery into Gaza\n\nAmnesty accuses Hamas of crimes against humanity\n\nAmnesty International said in a report released Thursday that Hamas and other militant groups committed crimes against humanity in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel that triggered the war in Gaza.\n\nIn the 173-page report, Amnesty pointed to what it found to be widespread and systematic killing of civilians in the attack, as well as torture, hostage-taking and sexual abuse.\n\nIn the attack, Hamas fighters and other militants rampaged through southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking around 250 others hostage. Israel's campaign in Gaza has since killed more than 70,300 Palestinians, roughly half of them women and children, according to the territory’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and civilians in its count. Last year, Amnesty accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, a charge Israel denied.\n\nAmnesty said it conducted interviews with 70 people, including 17 survivors of the attack and family members of some of those killed. It also reviewed hundreds of open-source videos and photos from the day of the attack.\n\nContrary to Hamas claims it was targeting the military, it said, the attack was intentionally “directed against a civilian population” and met international law standards for crimes against humanity.\n\nIt said sexual assaults were also committed, though it said it could not reach a conclusion on their “scope or scale.” It interviewed one man who testified he was raped by armed men at the Nova music festival, as well as a therapist who said she provided intensive treatment to three other survivors of rape.\n\nHamas condemned the report, saying it “echoed false claims” by Israel.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister spokesperson Oren Marmorstein derided the report in a posting on X, saying it took more than two years for Amnesty to address the attack “and even now its report falls far short of reflecting the full scope of Hamas’s horrific atrocities.”",

    "description": "At least four provinces will be using the sales of their American liquor to fund food banks and charities.",
    "fullText": "Canada is coming up with ways to put its stockpiled American liquor to good use.\n\nSeveral provinces in the country halted imports of US booze and removed it from store shelves in March in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nNow, at least four provinces are planning to sell the remaining inventory and donate proceeds to food banks.\n\nCanada's far eastern province, Prince Edward Island, told Business Insider that its government will put its stock of American booze, which it had pulled off the shelves, back in stores starting on December 11.\n\nA representative for the province's finance department said the government anticipates profits of $600,000 Canadian dollars, or about $434,000, from the sale. The proceeds will be distributed to food banks across the island. The province says it does not intend to place any further orders for American alcohol.\n\nThe finance office of Newfoundland and Labrador told Business Insider it had made an upfront payment of $500,000 on Tuesday to 60 provincial food banks before the sales of any liquors, a move that will help more than 15,400 people. After the liquor is sold, more donations will go to the food banks for a total sum of up to $1 million.\n\nManitoba and Nova Scotia have similar plans.\n\nManitoba said it will sell its inventory through private retailers and restaurants, with the estimated $500,000 in net revenue going to food banks, holiday charities, children's organizations, and an advocacy group for First Nations.\n\nAs for Nova Scotia, the province is making a $4 million upfront payment to groups that provide food access, and the money will be recouped when the $14 million worth of liquor is eventually sold.\n\n\"We will not be ordering any more from the United States once this inventory is gone,\" the province's premier, Tim Houston, said in a statement. \"But Nova Scotians have already paid for this product.\"\n\nHe added, \"We don't want it to go to waste. That's why we're selling it and using the proceeds to help those in need.\"\n\nIn Canada, the sale of alcohol is mainly controlled by provincial governments, each of which establishes a board to oversee the matter. Only Alberta has a completely privatized alcohol retail system, while Saskatchewan has a partially privatized system.\n\nCanada mainly imports whiskey and bourbon, alongside beer and other spirits, from the US.\n\nA spokesperson for Ontario's finance ministry told Business Insider that the province had no plans to put the booze on store shelves soon.\n\n\"US alcohol will remain off shelves and is being held in storage until further notice,\" said the spokesperson. \"We are currently exploring options for the products.\"\n\nOntario did not disclose how much inventory it still has, but the province said the inventory it had pulled off the shelves in March was worth around C$80 million.\n\nA government representative from the Northwest Territories and a spokesperson of the British Columbia Liquor Distribution Branch both told Business Insider that they ceased US liquor imports in March, but will continue selling the stockpiled products until they are depleted.\n\nA Yukon government cabinet representative said Yukon has the same plan.\n\nHowever, the mountainous province of Alberta continues to import and sell American booze.\n\n\"In June this year, Alberta lifted restrictions on the purchase of US alcohol from American companies, signalling a renewed commitment to open and fair trade with our largest partner,\" a spokesperson of Service Alberta and Red Tape Reduction told Business Insider.\n\nThe matter of US booze has been fueling the trade tension between the two neighbors.\n\nThe animosity started when Trump imposed a 25% tariff on Canada in March and commented that Canada should become a state of the US.\n\nDespite later walking back some of his broader tariffs and upholding a previous agreement that ensured most goods remain tariff-free, Trump's moves have drawn the ire of Canadians, who have canceled travel plans and boycotted American goods in stores.\n\nAccording to the Distilled Spirits Council, US spirits exports to Canada plummeted 85% in the second quarter of 2025, falling below $10 million in export value.\n\n\"We hope both the US and Canada can address their respective concerns,\" said Chris Swonger, the CEO of the council. \"And that our products can return to Canadian retail shelves as soon as possible.\"\n\nIn March, Kentucky's bourbon makers said Canada's ban on American alcohol would hurt them.\n\nEric Gregory, the president of the Kentucky Distillers' Association, said in March that retaliatory tariffs would have \"far-reaching consequences across Kentucky, home to 95% of the world's bourbon.\"",

    "description": "When I lived in Europe, I visited a variety of Christmas markets. I enjoyed the scenery, food, and trinkets at markets in Vienna, Geneva, and Bruges.",
    "fullText": "I've always been enchanted by the idea of European Christmas markets. Complete with rosy glowing lights, steaming mulled wine, and stalls dripping with handmade crafts, they seemed like something out of a storybook.\n\nSo, when I moved to Budapest in 2017 and was suddenly just a quick flight or train away from many of the continent's most famous markets, I knew I had to take advantage of the opportunity.\n\nHere are six of my favorite cities that I think should be at the top of your list if you're planning to visit Europe's Christmas markets this holiday season.\n\nOf course, I have to start with Budapest. The city is famous for its grand palaces, and come winter, it's dotted with incredible Christmas markets.\n\nOne of my favorites is the Advent Basilica Market, which pulls you in like a magnet with colorful stalls, a towering Christmas tree, and a light show every 30 minutes — all in front of St. Stephen's Basilica.\n\nThe market is filled with so many amazing scents, from the lavender goods and crafts made on the peninsula of Tihany to the paprika Hungary is famous for — it's even in soap.\n\nFor a truly local experience, hop across the river to ice skate at the Advent in Óbuda market, located about 20 minutes from the Basilica on public transport.\n\nWhile you're in the city, I recommend trying kürtőskalács, which you can watch vendors make at all of the major markets.\n\nTranslated as \"chimney cake,\" this spiral of dough is cooked over hot coals before being rolled in toppings, such as sugar, cocoa, or cinnamon (to name a few). When it's fresh off the coals, steam rises from the center of the pastry, resembling a smoking chimney.\n\nI first fell in love with Danish Christmas markets when I studied in Copenhagen for a semester, delighted by how they brought warmth to the darkness of Scandinavian winters.\n\nThe Nyhavn Christmas Market is located on the banks of the canal, with the colorfully painted buildings decorated with lights and julehjerter (Christmas hearts).\n\nI loved that the market was in one of Copenhagen's most iconic areas — it felt like celebrating Christmas in a postcard.\n\nFor a unique holiday experience, visit Tivoli Gardens, the second-oldest amusement park in the world. The already whimsical theme park is covered in Christmas decorations this time of year, plus there's ice skating and a traditional market for visitors to explore.\n\nDon't forget to stop for a ride or two, and try Æbleskiver from one of the market stands. These fluffy, pancake-like balls, dusted in powdered sugar, are so easy to eat, especially with a side of gløgg (mulled wine) to keep you warm.\n\nSituated on the shores of Lake Geneva is the Christmas market Noël au Quai. To get a great view of the Jet d'Eau (an iconic fountain in the lake), hop onto the market's Ferris wheel, then stroll between chalets filled with crafts, gifts, and food.\n\nOne thing I love about Swiss Christmas market food is the dedication to cheese. As soon as I saw a stall selling Chäsbängel — a hollowed-out baguette filled with melted cheese — I knew I had to have it.\n\nI also enjoyed raclette, another melted cheese that pairs well with potatoes, pickles, and more, and absolutely hits the spot on a cold winter's day.\n\nOh, and it's also a great opportunity to try famous Swiss chocolate.\n\nVienna is home to some of the most storied Christmas markets in Europe.\n\nMy favorite — and arguably the city's most famous — is the sprawling market at the Rathausplatz (City Hall), which has a whimsical carousel and towering displays of keepsake ornaments.\n\nI also suggest stopping by Stephansplatz Market, located in the city center, wrapping around the famous St. Stephen's Cathedral.\n\nIt's so cool to stand around the small tables in the shadow of such a Gothic masterpiece, keeping your hands warm by wrapping them around a mug of glühwein (mulled wine). Plus, for a few extra Euros, you can buy a keepsake mug to take home with you.\n\nLuckily, with just a 20-minute train ride between Bruges and Ghent, it's easy to visit both cities' markets in a day. Plus, both are about an hour from Brussels, too, making them good options for a day trip from the capital.\n\nThe red brick building facades and cobblestone streets of Bruges make the city look like something straight from a fairytale.\n\nBeyond the official markets, I loved window shopping among the seemingly endless chocolate shops, dressed with holiday decor and piles of handmade bonbons.\n\nAnd in Ghent, the markets are scattered throughout the small city, offering visitors ample opportunity to stroll around and admire the medieval architecture all dressed up for the festive season.\n\nWhile you're at the markets, make sure to grab a cone of piping-hot, crispy frites (fries) and a side of rich Belgian mayonnaise for dipping.",

    "fullText": "The US Food and Drug Administration is looking into whether deaths “across multiple age groups” have been related to Covid-19 vaccines, a spokesperson said Tuesday, weeks after a senior agency official claimed — without offering evidence – that Covid-19 vaccinations resulted in the deaths of 10 children.\n\nAndrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services, said the FDA is conducting “a thorough investigation” but declined to offer details on what data sources are being used and what potential changes, if any, are being considered to Covid vaccine approval or marketing.\n\nDr. Vinay Prasad, the FDA’s chief medical and scientific officer and director of its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, claimed in a memo late last month that “Healthy young children who faced tremendously low risk of death were coerced, at the behest of the Biden administration, via school and work mandates, to receive a vaccine that could result in death.”\n\nPrasad did not provide details about the 10 deaths or how the FDA came to that conclusion but pointed to “an initial analysis” that examined 96 deaths and linked 10 to the Covid-19 vaccination. He also claimed that Covid “was never highly lethal for children” and that the effects of it “are comparable” to respiratory viruses for which there aren’t annual vaccines.\n\nMore than 700 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in the US since they became available in late 2020, according to the World Health Organization. The shots have been extensively tested and continually monitored for safety, and serious side effects such as anaphylaxis or myocarditis have been generally rare.\n\nFDA regulations require health care providers to report deaths after vaccination to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), even if it’s not clear that vaccination was the cause of death. Members of the general public can also submit events to the database, which federal agencies use to generate further study on vaccine safety.\n\nPrasad said that as a result of the FDA analysis, the agency will adopt a new approval process for vaccines that will require more evidence of their safety and value before they can be marketed. Among the changes would be stricter requirements for authorization of vaccines used for pregnant women and trials for pneumonia vaccines that will need to prove the shots reduce disease, instead of showing that the vaccine produces enough antibodies to fight the illness.\n\nThe agency will also “revise the annual flu vaccine framework,” Prasad said, and “will re-appraise safety and be honest in vaccine labels.”\n\nHHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has repeatedly raised doubts about the effectiveness of vaccines and previously founded the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense.\n\nAs secretary, Kennedy has slashed funding for mRNA vaccine development, replaced the members of the vaccine advisory committee at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and directed the CDC to change its website to include false claims that link autism and vaccines.\n\nCNN’s Kaanita Iyer, Adam Cancryn and Amanda Sealy contributed to this report.",

    "description": "I never thought I'd move back to my hometown, Portland, Oregon, but I did. Now, I love living here for many reasons, from the food to the community.",
    "fullText": "Portland, Oregon, isn't perfect.\n\nIt's not particularly diverse, and most restaurants close way too early for anyone under the age of 60. The \"Pacific Northwest freeze\" is a real thing: People here can be simultaneously too nice and impossible to befriend.\n\nWhen I left Portland in my early 20s to travel the world for almost a decade, I didn't think I'd ever move back. Growing up there was pretty magical, but I hated the city in the way most angsty teens hate their hometown.\n\nThen, amid the coronavirus pandemic, I booked a flight back to Portland to be near family. Five years later, I'm still here — and I can't see myself living anywhere else. Here's why.\n\nPortland is surrounded by natural beauty.\n\nLocals love to brag that you can be in the mountains or on the coast within an hour and a half — a luxury few cities can claim.\n\nBelieve it or not, you can even be in the rainforest in half an hour, surrounded by ferns and fluorescent-green moss.\n\nI regularly make the scenic drive to the Columbia River Gorge, a historic stretch dotted with tunnels and waterfalls, when I need to clear my mind. Stopping to stand at the base of a 620-foot waterfall and get misted in the face never fails to do the trick.\n\nThe natural beauty really is everywhere. On a casual walk around my neighborhood, I've found everything from fresh blackberries and wild bunnies to roaming chickens and secret gardens filled with dahlias and roses.\n\nI'm convinced Portland has more outstanding restaurants per capita than any other city.\n\nThough the city is predominantly white, my taste buds have been thrilled in recent years to see diversity reflected in Portland's rise to foodie fame.\n\nThe star of the show is Kann, a James Beard Award-winning restaurant by Gregory Gourdet, where \"Haitian cuisine meets Pacific Northwest bounty,\" and an absolutely mind-blowing plantain brioche meets my mouth.\n\nThen there's Jinju Patisserie, named the country's most outstanding bakery at the James Beard Awards earlier this year. There, two Korean-born pastry chefs whip up croissants that rival any I've had in Paris.\n\nBut award winners barely scratch the surface. My personal list of outstanding local Thai restaurants is longer than my Trader Joe's receipts.\n\nPlus, Portland is especially known for its food trucks, which is how I first tried Guyanese food (at Bake on the Run), snow-cheese Korean fried chicken (at Frybaby), and Puerto Rican-Philly fusion dishes (at Papi Sal's).\n\nI came out after leaving Oregon, and before moving back, I'd only lived in areas where the LGBTQ+ community was either small or centered on gay men.\n\nPortland is the first time I've felt included, and the queer community here is at the heart of why I chose to stay. This city's LGBTQ+ community feels refreshingly queer.\n\nMy friends and I joke that most bars in Portland are gay bars just because the local population has so many queer folks. Many popular nightlife spots regularly host LGBTQ+ events, even if they aren't specifically \"gay bars.\"\n\nOn any given weekend, I might have to choose between a \"Twilight\"-themed drag show, an LGBTQ+ storytelling event, a queer pie-eating contest, a lesbian dance party, or a trans wrestling match.\n\nBecause it rarely takes me longer than 15 minutes to get anywhere around the city, I can try to squeeze all the events in.\n\nAnd when I wake up exhausted and hungry on Sunday morning, I can join my fellow Portland gays doing what we love most — waiting in inordinately long brunch lines.\n\nIf you've got a special interest, you're bound to find a group of people here who are loudly and proudly into the same thing, no matter how niche or offbeat.\n\nCan you guess where I've made the most friends in Portland? If you said, \"a weekly '80s-themed mall walk in the city's half-abandoned Lloyd Center mall,\" you'd be right.\n\nWhen I picked up rollerskating during the pandemic, I was thrilled to learn that the city runs a \"secret roller disco\" every week in undisclosed pop-up locations like warehouse parking lots (and the same half-abandoned mall).\n\nOver the summer, I participated in a watermelon-wrestling fundraiser. In the fall, I got to take an entire four-week class about 1970s cult horror in the back room of Movie Madness, one of the country's only remaining video-rental stores.\n\nThe older I get, the more I appreciate that Portland doesn't feel like a city, but rather it's a bunch of neighborhoods quilted together.\n\nIt's easy to feel welcome here when there are free tiny libraries and flyers for different clubs and events around every corner.\n\nEverything I love about Portland, from the hiking trails to my favorite Thai soup spot (shoutout to Khao Moo Dang) to the drag scene, comes down to one thing: community.\n\nIt's an elusive concept I spent most of my 20s searching for in far-off places. In an ironic twist of fate that really pleases my mother, I ended up finding it in my hometown.",

    "fullText": "UN GEO report says ending this harm key to global transformation required ‘before collapse becomes inevitable’\n\nThe unsustainable production of food and fossil fuels causes $5bn (£3.8bn) of environmental damage per hour, according to a major UN report.\n\nEnding this harm was a key part of the global transformation of governance, economics and finance required “before collapse becomes inevitable”, the experts said.\n\nThe Global Environment Outlook (GEO) report, which is produced by 200 researchers for the UN Environment Programme, said the climate crisis, destruction of nature and pollution could no longer be seen as simply environmental crises.\n\n“They are all undermining our economy, food security, water security, human health and they are also [national] security issues, leading to conflict in many parts of the world,” said Prof Robert Watson, the co-chair of the assessment.\n\nAll the environmental crises were worsening as the global population grows and required more food and energy, most of which was produced in ways that pollute the planet and destroy the natural world, the experts said. A sustainable world was possible, they said, but required political courage.\n\n“This is an urgent call to transform our human systems now before collapse becomes inevitable,” said Prof Edgar Gutiérrez-Espeleta, another co-chair and the former environment minister in Costa Rica.\n\n“The science is good. The solutions are known. What is required is the courage to act at the scale and speed that history demands,” he said, adding that the window for action was “rapidly narrowing”.\n\nThe experts acknowledged that the geopolitical situation today was difficult, with the US under Donald Trump, some other countries and corporate vested interests working to block or reverse environmental action. Watson, a former chair of leading international climate and biodiversity science groups, said: “The public have got to demand that they want a sustainable future for their children and their grandchildren. Most governments do try and respond.”\n\nThe GEO report is comprehensive – 1,100 pages this year – and is usually accompanied by a summary for policymakers, which is agreed by all the world’s countries. However, strong objections by countries including Saudi Arabia, Iran, Russia, Turkey and Argentina to references to fossil fuels, plastics, reduced meat in diets and other issues meant no agreement was reached this time.\n\nA statement made by the UK on behalf of 28 countries said: “We witnessed diversion attempts to question the scientific nature of this process. Our delegations fully respect every state’s right to safeguard their country’s national interests and rights, but science is not negotiable.”\n\nThe GEO report emphasised that the costs of action were much less than the costs of inaction in the long term, and estimated the benefits from climate action alone would be worth $20tn a year by 2070 and $100tn by 2100. “We need visionary countries and private sector [companies] to recognise they will make more profit by addressing these issues rather than ignoring them,” Watson said.\n\nThe report contained several “critical truths”, Gutiérrez-Espeleta said: environmental crises were political and security emergencies, threatening the social ties that held societies together. Today’s governments and economic systems were failing humanity and financial reform was the cornerstone of transformation, he said: “Environmental policy must become the backbone of national security, social justice, and economic strategy.”\n\nOne of the biggest issues was the $45tn a year in environmental damage caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas, and the pollution and destruction of nature caused by industrial agriculture, the report said. The food system carried the largest costs, at $20tn, with transport at $13tn and fossil-fuel powered electricity at $12tn.\n\nThese costs – called externalities by economists – must be priced into energy and food to reflect their real price and shift consumers towards greener choices, Watson said: “So we need social safety nets. We need to make sure that the poorest in society are not harmed by an increase in costs.”\n\nThe report suggests measures such as a universal basic income, taxes on meat and subsidies for healthy, plant-based foods.\n\nThere were also about $1.5tn in environmentally harmful subsidies to fossil fuels, food and mining, the report said. These needed to be removed or repurposed, it added. Watson noted that wind and solar energy was cheaper in many places but held back by vested interests in fossil fuel.\n\nThe climate crisis may be even worse than thought, he said: “We are likely to be underestimating the magnitude of climate change”, with global heating probably at the high end of the projections made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nRemoving fossil fuel subsidies could cut emissions by a third, the report said.",

    "fullText": "Billy McFarland is trying to rise from the ashes of Fyre Festival.\n\nHis latest event is PHNX — pronounced \"Phoenix.\" It attracted dozens of attendees over the weekend. Like the original Fyre Festival, it was heavily documented by camera crews and social media users.\n\nSince being released from prison in 2022, after pleading guilty to wire fraud charges related to Fyre Festival, McFarland has been planning redemption from the disastrous 2017 festival that left hundreds of attendees stranded, hungry, and thirsty on a Bahamian island and became the subject of a hit Netflix documentary.\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday, McFarland ran it back with a smaller crowd, a mix of parties, excursions, and musical guests like French Montana as the headliner on Utila Bay, an island off the coast of Honduras.\n\nTo everyone who laughed at the bathroom barge. To everyone who said there wouldn’t be power. Who wants to be part of history? See you in 4 days.\n\nGeneral admission tickets to PHNX cost $599. VIP passes went for up to $140,000 and included round-trip flights from Miami. PHNX offered all attendees brunch, lunch, dinner, and a handful of excursions, including scuba diving and a cave hike, in their ticket packages.\n\nThe itinerary was a far cry from the events that unfolded in 2017. Where unsanitary or simply unavailable bathrooms became a hallmark of Fyre Festival's failures, McFarland showed off a \"bathroom barge\" of floating port-a-potties for PHNX. He also shared fresh fruit stands and food options, including lobster, steak, and fresh salads — a much different menu from the infamous cheese sandwiches served at the first Fyre Festival.\n\nFestival-goers, McFarland, and performers took their followers along for the ride at PHNX 2025. The event was also available via livestream for paying viewers.\n\nOne performer, a DJ who goes by 220 Kid, documented his time at the festival in several videos. His post about the vegetarian food option went particularly viral. The plate of rice and a single cob of corn drew scrutiny and a call back to the meager cheese sandwiches from 2017.\n\nRappers Slim Jxmmi and Bobby Shmurda showed up, and a clip from headliner French Montana's set showed a modest crowd dancing.\n\nConfirmed ! French showed up every artist did! Love this island so much ! #fyrefestival #PHNX\n\n\"We set out to bring 400 people and a dozen artists to a private island in the Utila Bay Islands, and the experience exceeded every expectation,\" McFarland said in a statement. \"PHNX 2025 was a milestone moment for us.\"\n\nVideos showed dozens of festival-goers on the dance floor at different times. It's unclear how many people attended.\n\nPHNX appeared to sidestep the big issues that defined Fyre, but it's too early to tell whether the event represents a meaningful reset for McFarland.\n\n\"This is only the beginning — a major announcement is coming soon,\" McFarland said.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Congress urged to act against energy-hungry facilities blamed for increasing bills and worsening climate crisis\n\nA coalition of more than 230 environmental groups has demanded a national moratorium on new datacenters in the US, the latest salvo in a growing backlash to a booming artificial intelligence industry that has been blamed for escalating electricity bills and worsening the climate crisis.\n\nThe green groups, including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Food & Water Watch and dozens of local organizations, have urged members of Congress to halt the proliferation of energy-hungry datacenters, accusing them of causing planet-heating emissions, sucking up vast amounts of water and exacerbating electricity bill increases that have hit Americans this year.\n\n“The rapid, largely unregulated rise of datacenters to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans’ economic, environmental, climate and water security,” the letter states, adding that approval of new data centers should be paused until new regulations are put in place.\n\nThe push comes amid a growing revolt against moves by companies such as Meta, Google and Open AI to plow hundreds of billions of dollars into new datacenters, primarily to meet the huge computing demands of AI. At least 16 datacenter projects, worth a combined $64bn, have been blocked or delayed due to local opposition to rising electricity costs. The facilities’ need for huge amounts of water to cool down equipment has also proved controversial, particularly in drier areas where supplies are scarce.\n\nThese seemingly parochial concerns have now multiplied to become a potent political force, helping propel Democrats to a series of emphatic recent electoral successes in governor elections in Virginia and New Jersey as well as a stunning upset win in a special public service commission poll in Georgia, with candidates campaigning on lowering power bill costs and curbing datacenters.\n\nThis threatens to be a major headache for Donald Trump, who has aggressively pushed the growth of AI but also called himself the “affordability president” and vowed to cut energy costs in half in his first year.\n\nHowever, household electricity prices have increased by 13% so far under Trump and the president recently lashed out in the wake of the election losses, calling affordability a “fake narrative” and a “con job” created by Democrats. “They just say the word,” Trump said last week. “It doesn’t mean anything to anybody. They just say it – affordability.”\n\nYet about 80 million Americans are currently struggling to pay their bills for electricity and gas, with many voters regardless of political party blaming datacenters for this, according to Charles Hua, founder and executive director of PowerLines, a non-partisan organization that aims to reduce power bills.\n\n“We saw rising utility bills become a core concern in the New Jersey, Georgia and Virginia elections, which shows us there is a new politics in America – we are entering a new era that is all about electricity prices,” Hua said.\n\n“Nobody in America wants to pay more for electricity and we saw in Georgia a meaningful chunk of conservative voters vote against the Republican incumbents, which was staggering.”\n\nHua said the causes of the electricity cost rises were nuanced, with ageing transmission lines and damage caused by extreme weather also adding to utilities’ costs on top of the surging demand for power.\n\nBut it is the growth of datacenters to service AI – with electricity consumption set to nearly triple over the next decade, equivalent to powering 190m new homes – that is the focus of ire for voters as well as an unlikely sweep of politicians ranging from Bernie Sanders on the left to Marjorie Taylor Greene on the far right.\n\nMore broadly, almost half of Americans say the cost of living in the US, including power, food and other essentials, is the worst they can ever remember it being.\n\nThis focus on affordability has provided a new line of attack for an environmental movement that has struggled to counter Trump’s onslaught upon rules that reduce air and water pollution. The president has called the climate crisis a “hoax” and clean energy a “scam” and has slashed support for and even blocked new wind and solar projects, even though renewables are often the cheapest and fastest options for new power generation.\n\nAt the current rate of growth, datacenters could add up to 44m tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by 2030, equivalent to putting an extra 10m cars on to the road and exacerbating a climate crisis that is already spurring extreme weather disasters and ripping apart the fabric of the American insurance market.\n\nBut it is the impact upon power bills, rather than the climate crisis, that is causing anguish for most voters, acknowledged Emily Wurth, managing director of organizing at Food & Water Watch, the group behind the letter to lawmakers.\n\n“I’ve been amazed by the groundswell of grassroots, bipartisan opposition to this, in all types of communities across the US,” she said. “Everyone is affected by this, the opposition has been across the political spectrum. A lot of people don’t see the benefits coming from AI and feel they will be paying for it with their energy bills and water.\n\n“It’s an important talking point,” Wurth said of the affordability concerns. “We’ve seen outrageous utility price rises across the country and we are going to lean into this. Prices are going up across the board and this is something Americans really do care about.”",
