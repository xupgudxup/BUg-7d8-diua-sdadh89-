    "description": "Three entrepreneurs bought a former mobile dentistry RV for $5,000 and turned it into a food truck that now generates around $240,000 in annual sales.",
    "fullText": "When self-taught private chef Isaac Flomo began posting images of his signature Southern comfort food on social media, he was delighted by the positive feedback.\n\nSome of his clients in his native city of Minneapolis included professional athletes with the Minnesota Timberwolves and Minnesota Vikings. Flomo's popularity soared when players shared photos of his classic recipes, such as chicken wings in Dijon Buffalo sauce and steak-and-cheese fries.\n\nHe worked out of his home kitchen but couldn't keep up with demand.\n\n\"I'd post that a plate would be available within a certain timeframe, but you'd have to pick it up before it was gone,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nFlomo's friends from childhood, JT Tarwai and Eddie Adegeye, saw the potential to build on his success and expand into the restaurant trade. The entrepreneurial trio talked about collaborating when the time was right.\n\nBut they were preoccupied with existing ventures and other plans ranging from wellness consulting and insurance to an assisted living company, a car dealership, and real estate.\n\nOne night in 2019, the friends found themselves hanging out in an RV belonging to Tarwai's uncle, watching TV, playing cards, and eating snacks.\n\nThe laid-back evening got them thinking about their latent idea: instead of the high stakes of investing in a brick-and-mortar restaurant, how about the slow rollout of a mobile food facility?\n\nThe 31-year-olds discreetly questioned people they knew in the Minneapolis nightlife scene who bemoaned the lack of affordable late-night eateries.\n\n\"They confirmed what we already knew,\" Tarwei said. \"There was a good customer base.\"\n\nThe pandemic delayed their business plan, but they tossed around ideas for the kind of vehicle they should use. In 2021, Flomo watched a YouTube video about a man who converted a yellow school bus into a mobile home.\n\n\"I thought it would be the perfect solution for us,\" he said. They looked into buying one, but nothing suitable came up.\n\nThen, they stumbled upon an unusual deal on the auction site, K-bid.com: an ad for a 1996 Winnebago that had been used as a mobile dentistry unit on a native American Indian reservation.\n\nIt had less than 400,000 miles on the clock and had been stripped of most of its specialist equipment, such as dental chairs. It contained office supplies, a bathroom, powerful LED lights in the treatment area, and random items such as examination gloves and a replica of a human jaw with teeth.\n\n\"It needed a bit of TLC, but it was perfect for us,\" Adegeye said.\n\nThe team split the $4,470 purchase three ways before an unexpected setback nearly derailed the project.\n\nThey hadn't bargained for major mechanical issues and soon discovered that the truck's axle needed immediate replacement for a hefty $15,000.\n\nIt prompted discussion about whether they'd made a terrible mistake. Still, the disappointment didn't last long.\n\n\"We're a bunch of optimists,\" Adegeye said. \"It would take more than that to keep us down because the food truck was a dream come true.\"\n\nThe estimated $100,000 renovation took two years to complete, with most of the money spent on labor. Contractors installed everything from stainless steel walls and counters to custom-made kitchen fittings, such as prep coolers.\n\nThe vehicle had to meet strict safety and hygiene codes, including the mandatory installation of an $8,000 fire-suppression system over the griddle.\n\nFlo's Eats LLC — named for Flomo — finally received its operating license on June 6, 2023, ahead of a soft opening near a bar in downtown Minneapolis's North Loop a week later.\n\n\"We knew there was a lot of foot traffic along that particular street,\" Tarwai said. \"Besides, we had to start somewhere.\"\n\nThe experiment was an unmitigated success. The team could barely keep up with demand and risked running out of ingredients.\n\nBusiness has been booming ever since. The truck has made such a name for itself, there is healthy competition among premises owners to have it parked outside their buildings at night.\n\nIt also serves workers during the day who lunch near The Commons, a green space in the heart of Minneapolis.\n\n\"We could never have imagined it would skyrocket in this way,\" Adebeye said. He said the business, which usually operates between March and November, has reached annual sales of $240,000.\n\nThe menu started out as — and has remained — relatively simple. Flomo said the best-sellers include his $17 buttermilk-fried chicken sandwich and $11 grilled cheese on garlic bread. \"Why change what's trusted and most popular?\" he said.\n\nSpecial events are another lucrative side of the enterprise. Flo's Eats has secured dates at large-scale city celebrations, including the Minneapolis Aquatennial over July 4 and the annual Monarch Festival, celebrating the butterfly migration to Mexico.\n\nTarwai said the lines of hundreds of people stretched so far that they couldn't see the end. They cope with the stress, he said, by dividing up the labor as fairly as possible.\n\n\"We can all work the different spots on the truck, whether it's griddle man, cashier, or something else,\" he said, noting that the truck goes out five or six times each week in peak season.\n\nThe biggest challenge for now is deciding on the next steps. The team has invested in a second RV — \"not a dental unit, this time,\" Adebeye said — which is expected to hit the streets this summer.\n\n\"The one thing we don't want to do is spread ourselves too thin and not be able to serve our home community,\" he said. \"In the meantime, we're enjoying the ride.\"",

    "fullText": "We explore the strange food-obsessed world of a new game whose tech was once called ‘an insult to life itself’ by Hayao Miyazaki, the film-maker behind Spirited Away\n\nA strange piece of software has recently landed on the PC gaming store Steam. And “software” feels like the cleanest way to describe it. Existing somewhere between a full-blown life sim, a science project and a kind of haunted fish tank, Anlife: Motion-learning Life Evolution probably would have disappeared without making much impact if it wasn’t for one unusual factor. Several years ago some of its creators were absolutely roasted on camera by one of the genuine legends of Japanese animation.\n\nBack in 2016, Hayao Miyazaki, the director of movies such as Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, was shown new technology that used AI in order to animate models. Faced with a zombie that utilised its head to move by knocking its skull against the ground and wriggling its body like a fish, Miyazaki declared what he had seen was “an insult to life itself”. It’s hard not to watch the clip without feeling slightly seared – but now, a decade later, the ashen-faced developers from that room have sufficiently recovered to make their work widely available.\n\nJudging by the chatter surrounding the launch, at least some of the people downloading Anlife are doing so in the hope that it might provide some kind of indication of the current state video games’ relationship with AI. Putting aside the often broad use of that term, this is certainly a thing that’s worth trying to understand, whether it’s because of the job losses caused by AI or blamed on AI, or the sheer number of games made with the assistance of AI models now landing on storefronts such as Steam.\n\nThere’s a problem here, though. And it’s that Anlife itself is such a cheerfully inconsequential thing that it’s hard to read too much of anything into it.\n\nAnlife promises players an evolution simulator where “AI-driven block creatures move in unexpected ways.” What this comes down to for the most part involves placing a range of different creatures into a small environment and then watching as they learn to get around.\n\nVisually Anlife is pure Frutiger Aero, offering landscapes of green valleys and sparkling water that could be the kind of soothing images MRI technicians sometimes encourage you to look at during a lengthy scan. Sonically it’s equally inoffensive: with a range of bloops, bleeps and popping sounds, we’re pitched right into the soundtrack of a million 00s day spas.\n\nThis desire to soothe permeates to the level of mechanics, too. Over the course of an idle morning with Anlife you can place a range of simple creatures in the environment and then give them food that will encourage them to breed or mutate. You can expand your territory and then lure creatures towards water or up into the air in order to create more variations. There are plenty of things to unlock (including a shadow tech tree that has you covered if you want to annihilate your digital sea monkeys rather than watching them flourish) but the ecosystem is kept simple. It’s a game about watching how things decide to crawl towards food.\n\nThe thrill of all of this presumably comes down to the “how” in that last sentence. This is where the game’s slightly mysterious use of AI is probably involved. And it’s true that, after a few hours of play, you’ll have Anlife’s funny little blob creatures exploring new kinds of joints and body arrangements as they swim and fly and generally roll around eating.\n\n(AI has a history of being used to make creatures walk around, incidentally, often using small neural networks and computer evolution. In 2009, the UK-based games technology company NaturalMotion developed a project in which a bipedal model learned to walk using evolved neural networks. The company was subsequently bought by Zynga in 2014.\n\nThere are two problems, however, the first being that the focus on unlocking the skill tree gives the opening hours of Anlife the feel of a rather mindless clicker game that it struggles to shake off. The second comes down to something that I gather people studying procedural generation sometimes refer to as “the oatmeal problem”.\n\nThe oatmeal problem, which was first formulated by writer, developer and academic Kate Compton, hinges on the fact that every single bowl of oatmeal in the universe is unique. Just not in a very interesting way. Similarly, when Anlife’s creatures discover a new way of rolling or bouncing or flapping their bodies towards food, they’re still just moving towards food. It makes for a game that’s either about really, really paying attention to tiny variations in detailing, or about completely zoning out and just enjoying the floaty aesthetic. Over the course of my time with Anlife, I’ve generally started with the first approach and then discovered, after 10 minutes, that I’ve slid into the second.\n\nThe more I played Anlife, the more I ended up thinking about something I heard from one of the first AI researchers I ever spoke to, all the way back in 2013. The real value of AI, they explained – and I am paraphrasing here – is that it could one day become a completely alien form of intelligence. Which means that us humans would have the lens of a different kind of mind through which to see ourselves and our quirks and cognitive fallacies – things that can be hard to spot when you’re talking to people who think in a very similar way to you.\n\nSince then the apparent focus for a lot of companies such as OpenAI seems to be completely the opposite: creating mimetic plagiarism machines that sometimes seem to exist only to tell people what they already want to hear.\n\nIt feels as if Anlife is filling a very small and specific niche. It isn’t trying to disguise its AI use, as far as I am aware. It’s actually trying to draw attention to the way it uses AI to allow its little creatures to move around. It’s not just a game born of AI, in other words. It’s a game that in some small way is actually about AI. It wants to be slightly alien. It doesn’t want to hide itself or ingratiate; it wants to examine AI’s innate capacity for otherness.",

Space heaters in particular should be placed on a flat, hard surface at least 3 feet from anything flammable. And never use your oven to heat your home.\n\nCrumple the papers and stuff them under clothes to keep warm, de Vulpillieres said.\n\nSand can help the tires move on slippery ice and snow. Salt can also help prevent the resulting slush from freezing again.\n\nIf you happen to have some in your car, it's worth using to get unstuck.\n\nThe mats can be placed under the tires to keep them from slipping.\n\nIn a pinch, pine needles and sticks can increase traction.\n\nAdding weight to a car by pushing down on the hood or placing rocks on top of it can help increase traction when attempting to drive out of snow.\n\nPulling a car out of a ditch is the most effective way to move it.\n\n\"In snow, it's better to pull than to push,\" de Vulpillieres said.\n\nCooking spray can be used to keep car doors from freezing shut by spraying the corners. Spraying your snow shovel can also keep snow from sticking to it.\n\nIf you don't have a snow brush or an ice scraper in your car, the edges of a credit card can get the job done.",

    "description": "\"It takes, like, 20 years of life, and all of the food you eat during that time before you get smart,\" Sam Altman said.",
    "fullText": "Sam Altman is pushing back on the idea that ChatGPT consumes too much energy.\n\n\"One of the things that is always unfair in this comparison is people talk about how much energy it takes to train an AI model relative to how much it costs a human to do one inference query,\" Altman told The Indian Express last week on the sidelines of a major AI summit. \"But it also takes a lot of energy to train a human.\"\n\nAltman suggested it's not an apples-to-apples comparison, arguing that it's unfair to discount the years spent nurturing and educating someone to be capable of making their own inquiries.\n\n\"It takes a lot of energy to train a human,\" he said, prompting some laughter in the crowd. \"It takes, like, 20 years of life, and all of the food you eat during that time before you get smart.\"\n\nAltman said the clock really began thousands of years ago.\n\n\"It took, like, the very widespread evolution of the 100 billion people that have ever lived and learned not to get eaten by predators and learned how to, like, figure out science or whatever,\" he said.\n\nAltman also called out what he said were \"totally insane\" claims on the internet that OpenAI is guzzling down water to power ChatGPT.\n\n\"Water is totally fake,\" Altman said, when asked about concerns AI companies use too much water. \"It used to be true, we used to do evaporative cooling in data centers, but now that we don't do that, you know, you see these like things on the internet where, 'Don't use ChatGPT, it's 17 gallons of water for each query' or whatever.\"\n\nIn June, Altman said that the average ChatGPT query consumes roughly the amount of energy needed to power a lightbulb for a few minutes.\n\n\"People are often curious about how much energy a ChatGPT query uses; the average query uses about 0.34 watt-hours, about what an oven would use in a little over one second, or a high-efficiency lightbulb would use in a couple of minutes,\" he wrote on X.\n\nAltman said it is fair as a whole to point out the AI industry's overall energy consumption because of the large growth in usage. He said it's why he and other AI CEOs have pushed alternative energy sources like solar, wind, and nuclear.\n\nUnlike other CEOs, namely xAI's Elon Musk, Altman is dismissive of the idea that space-based data centers are realistic in the next decade, a concept that some companies have floated as a way to reduce energy consumption.\n\nOutside of OpenAI, Altman is a major investor in nuclear energy. He previously served as chairman of Oklo, a nuclear energy startup, and has been a major backer of Helion, which plans to build what it calls \"the world's first fusion power plant\" in Washington state.\n\nIn the US, data center energy consumption is becoming a major topic. Last month, President Donald Trump said he was working with tech companies on \"a commitment to the American people\" to ensure that citizens don't pay higher energy bills because of a nearby data center.\n\nConsulting firm McKinsey & Company estimated last year that data centers could account for 14% of total power demand in the US by 2050.",

    "description": "Consumers should stop using the product immediately.",
    "fullText": "Freeze-dried food and treats have become a popular feeding option for both cats and dogs. The food provides a better delivery system for nutrients to your pets without the downsides of raw food, which can pose a salmonella risk.\n\nHowever, freeze-dried foods are not exempt from recalls. One popular cat food brand recently issued a voluntary recall for their freeze-dried chicken cat nuggets. It wasn't for bacterial contamination, though. This recall was due to a possible vitamin deficiency.\n\n🐶\nView the complete details on this recall at: https://t.co/E5Zy1sSKuI pic.twitter.com/pSb6bD7qW0\n\n— U.S. FDA Recalls (@FDArecalls) February 18, 2026\n\nIf your cat is eating the Quest Cat Food Chicken Recipe, you need to check your pantry. The voluntary recall affects one specific lot: C25288 with the UPC: 6-91730-18103-1 and a Best Buy Date of 10/15/2027. The zip-lock bags were sold in Colorado, Utah, Washington, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Michigan, California, Texas and Illinois. The affected batch may have low thiamine levels, also known as vitamin B1.\n\nThe recall of the freeze-dried nuggets was triggered after a cat owner reported illness in their cat. Thankfully, a veterinarian treated the cat, and it has recovered. So far, it is the only cat to have experienced adverse effects from the product.\n\nThe product was tested by the veterinarian who treated the ill cat, and the test indicated that the lot did not meet the required thiamine levels to support a cat's diet. Quest conducted further testing to verify that the lot may have low thiamine levels. Quest's parent company, Go Raw LLC, has already taken measures to ensure that this doesn't happen again.\n\nThiamine is considered an essential nutrient for cats. According to a 2017 study, the water-soluble vitamin helps animals process carbohydrates, synthesize nucleotides, and maintain normal nervous system function. Since they can't produce the vitamin on their own, they need to consume at least 0.33 to 0.35 milligrams per day to maintain healthy levels.\n\nWhile deficiencies can be reversed if caught early enough, they can lead to severe medical issues. According to the FDA's press release, cats' nervous systems and stomachs can be affected. \"Early signs of thiamine deficiency may include decreased appetite, salivation, vomiting, failure to grow, and weight loss,\" the release said. \"In advanced cases, neurological signs may develop, including ventroflexion (bending towards the floor) of the neck, mental dullness, vision changes, wobbly walking, circling, falling, and seizures.\"\n\nIf not treated in time, cats can also become so ill that they die from their symptoms. Go Raw LLC has said that consumers should immediately stop using the product and return it to the store where it was purchased for a full refund. If you have any questions, you can email the company at cs@gorawllc.com or call them at (801) 432-7478, Monday through Friday, 9 am to 4 p.m. MST.",

    "fullText": "Late last year, as a US government shutdown cut off the Snap benefits that low-income families rely on for groceries, videos on social media cast the fallout in frantic scenes. “Imma keep it real with you,” a Black woman said in a viral TikTok post, “I get over $2,500 a month in stamps. I sell ’em, $2,000 worth, for about $1,200-$1,500 cash.” Another Black woman ranted about taxpayers’ responsibility to her seven children with seven men, and yet another melted down after her food stamps were rejected at a corn-dog counter.\n\nVisible watermarks stamped some videos as AI-generated – apparently, too faintly for the racist commentators and hustlers more than happy to believe the frenzy was real. “You got people treating it like a side hustle, selling the stamps, abusing the system,” the conservative commentator Amir Odom whinged. Fox News reported on the Snap deepfakes as if they were authentic, before issuing a correction. Newsmax anchor Rob Schmitt claimed people were using Snap “to get their nails done, to get their weaves and hair”. (Lost in the outrage was a basic fact: white Americans make up 37% of Snap’s 42 million beneficiaries.)\n\nThe fake videos are mere shards in the widening mosaic of digital blackface, a pattern that’s spiked in the past two years as generative AI video tools have become widely accessible. “There’s been a massive acceleration,” says Safiya Umoja Noble, a UCLA gender studies professor and author of Algorithms of Oppression, which focuses on digital biases against Black women in particular. “The digital blackface videos are really pulling from the same racist and sexist stereotypes and tropes that have been used for centuries.” The net effect is a patina of Blackness stripped of cultural obligation or stewardship – minstrelsy in a nutshell.\n\nCoined in a 2006 academic paper, the term digital blackface describes a form of Black cultural commodification repurposed for non-Black expression online. Examples run the gamut: posts in African American Vernacular English, the use of darker-skinned emojis, reaction memes featuring Beyoncé, Katt Williams and other exemplars of Black cool.\n\n“The early research that was done on digital blackface started with white gamers using bitmojis of a different race and changing their vernacular to represent themselves,” says Mia Moody, a Baylor University journalism professor whose forthcoming book, Blackface Memes, links the role of Black users in starting and spreading online trends to subsequent digital blackface. “That’s part of the cultural appropriation, gaining the cultural capital. Maybe you’re a nerdy white guy, but if you use this cool avatar of a Black guy with dreadlocks, people will give you respect. You’re interesting all of a sudden.”\n\nDuring memeology’s expansion into short-form video, Black expression has increasingly been divorced from authorship, context or consequence. Internet culture scholars say some non-white online creators use AI-generated avatars modeled on familiar Black faces – the beauty influencer, the culture podcaster, the man-on-the-street interviewer; they slip into feeds alongside real Black content creators. Large language models scour digital spaces that gained cachet from Black speech and humor, absorbing their tone and slang. Hume AI is one of many firms that offer synthetic voices for podcasts and audiobooks such as “Black woman with subtle Louisiana accent”, or “middle-aged African American man with a tone of hard-earned wisdom”. In most cases, creators whose speech is scraped from YouTube, podcasts and social media receive no compensation, much less even know their personalities shaped these models.\n\nThe Snap reaction clips, however, were a notable escalation in the mainstreaming of digital blackface – less blending in, more weapons-grade stereotyping. Many of those videos were created with OpenAI’s text-to-video app Sora. As Sora’s popularity surged in 2025, users exploited its hyperrealism to sully Martin Luther King Jr’s image, sparking ethical debate around “synthetic resurrection”. Deepfakes showed him shoplifting, wrestling Malcolm X, and swearing through his I Have a Dream speech. Conservative influencers swamped feeds with AI-generated embraces between King and Charlie Kirk, conflating their clashing legacies and cultural martyrdom. Bernice King, MLK’s daughter and the director of his Atlanta-based non-profit, criticized the slopaganda as “foolishness”.\n\nInevitably the Trump White House has gotten into the act. In January the official White House X account posted a doctored photo of Minnesota activist Nekima Levy Armstrong, darkened and weeping, in the wake of her arrest at a non-violent anti-ICE demonstration. Earlier this month an image portraying the Obamas as apes was circulated via Trump’s own Truth Social account.\n\nBlackface abides at the underbelly of American mass media even as it evolves at breakneck pace. Its roots trace to the minstrel revues of the early 19th century; white performers smeared grease paint made from charred corks on their faces and plastered on oversized white lips to caricature Black features, and performed exaggerated routines of Black laziness, buffoonery and hypersexuality. Thomas D Rice, a Manhattan playwright, shot to fame in the 1830s playing a loping trickster named Jim Crow – a name that quickly became shorthand for the forced racial segregation policies in the American south that endured until the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n\nIn their heyday, minstrel shows were the dominant form of American entertainment – reflected in newspaper cartoons and the enormously popular Amos ‘n’ Andy radio shows. After the civil war, Black performers were largely forced into adopting minstrel elements, at the expense of their personhood once more, just to gain any footing on stage. “The objectives were, first, to make money to help educate our younger ones, and second, to try to break down the ill feeling that existed toward the colored people,” explained Tom Fletcher, a vaudeville minstrel and actor for almost 70 years who died in 1954.\n\nEven as minstrelsy faded from the spotlight by the early 20th century, its toxic residue lingered in American culture – from the shuffling crows of Disney’s Dumbo, to Ted Danson’s infamous 1993 blackface roast of Whoopi Goldberg, to the annual parade of white Halloween revelers in racial masquerade. A decade ago, when the internet was still a black box of sorts, researchers such as Noble and MIT’s Joy Buolamwini were sounding the alarm about the inherent racial biases in the coding of algorithms related to medical treatment, loan applications, hiring decisions and facial recognition. Now it’s out in the open, smearing wider and deeper than any burnt cork routine ever could.\n\nTech firms have made some effort to stem the tide of digital blackface. Bowing to public backlash, the King family and more prominent estates, OpenAI, Google and the AI image generator Midjourney disallowed deepfakes of King and other American icons. In January 2025, Meta deleted two of its own AI blackface characters – a retiree called Grandpa Brian and Liv, described as a “proud Black queer momma” and “truth-teller” – after allegations of their non-diverse development team fueled a tempest of criticism. Instagram and TikTok and more have made some attempts to scrub viral digital blackface videos, to tepid results. Last summer, efforts to replicate Bigfoot Baddie – the AI avatar of a Black woman as a human-yeti hybrid in pink wigs, acrylic nails and hair bonnets, created by Google’s Veo AI – erupted into a full-blown social media craze, with some users even hustling how-to courses. The avatar is still on socials.\n\nBlack in AI and the Distributed AI Research Institute (Dair) are among the handful of affinity groups that have pushed for diversity and community input in AI model-building to address programming bias. The AI Now Institute and Partnership on AI have highlighted the risks of AI systems learning from marginalized communities’ data and noted that tech companies could provide mechanisms such as data opt-outs to help limit harmful or exploitative uses. But widespread adoption has been glacial.\n\n“YouTube alone has something like 400 hours of content per minute being uploaded,” Noble says. “With AI generation, these tech firms cannot manage what’s coming through their systems. So they don’t. Or they do what’s absolutely imperative to the US government. But if you have an authoritarian regime in power, they can use your systems to facilitate propaganda.”\n\nAlthough the precise impact of AI-generated digital blackface is difficult to quantify, its use by the Trump administration highlights its potential as a powerful tool of official disinformation. The Obama Truth Social entry revived a slur that has festered for years in darker online corners, and one that rhymes with Trump’s sustained efforts to denigrate the former first family. (Trump disclaimed direct responsibility and refused to apologize for that post, which was taken down.) Meanwhile, the White House’s doctored image of Armstrong, altered from an actual photo taken by the Department of Homeland Security and published on their official Twitter account, scanned as a psyop by a government working closely with tech firms to track activists and other perceived enemies of the state.\n\nBeyond laundering bigotry as news, digital blackface exposes Black users to a level of personalized abuse and harassment that harkens to a minstrelsy heyday when racists were fully empowered to express their bigotry unbidden. And then just as now, it seems there is little that can be done to curb the vitriol. “We are living in a United States with an open, no-holds-barred, anti-civil-rights, anti-immigrant, anti-Black, anti-LGBTQ, anti-poor-policy agenda,” Noble says. “Finding the material to support this position is just a matter of the state bending reality to fit its imperatives. And that’s easily done when every tech company lines up behind the White House.”\n\nEven so, Moody remains hopeful that the current fascination with digital blackface will soon be as outdated and uninviting as the analog variant. She has seen this play before, after all. “Right now people are just experimenting with AI technology and having a ball seeing what they can get away with,” she says. “Once we get beyond that, then we’re going to see less of it. They’ll move on to something else. Or they’ll be up for a job, and it’ll be embarrassing. Just look at the history.”",

    "description": "After visiting all 20 regions of Italy, my favorite for food is Emilia-Romagna. This region has incredible cheese, truffles, tomatoes, and tortellini.",
    "fullText": "It's no secret that Italy has some of the world's best food. However, after visiting all 20 regions, I've learned that the country isn't one-size-fits-all when it comes to dining in la dolce vita.\n\nEach region has niche dishes and products that locals wear like a badge of honor, like mozzarella di bufala from Campania, pesto alla Genovese from Liguria, and arancini from Sicily.\n\nAlthough I would gladly choose to eat anywhere in Italy over any city in the US, Emilia-Romagna gets the gold for the best cuisine in the country.\n\nFrom Parmigiano-Reggiano and balsamic vinegar of Modena to Prosciutto di Parma and mortadella from Bologna, Emilia-Romagna is home to some of Italy's most beloved exports.\n\nThese are just a few of the products that are PDO and PGI-certified. This is a high standard in the world of food that signals an official link between a product and a region. Emilia-Romagna has 44 PDO and PGI products in total — more than any other Italian region.\n\nYou'll also find some of the country's most famous restaurants here, like Osteria Francescana and Al Gatto Verde in Modena, and Trattoria da Amerigo in Savigno.\n\nBeyond the accolades and fancy titles, though, I believe that what makes Emilia-Romagna's cuisine a standout is simply the care and attention put into the food I've had here. After visiting the region at least twice a year for the past six years, I have yet to have even a subpar meal.\n\nIn Italy, some regions just do certain products better. For example, Tuscany is famous for its red wine; meanwhile, many head to Piedmont for truffles, and Campania's tomatoes are top-notch.\n\nHowever, Emilia-Romagna really has a city or town for everything you could ever want on your plate. Savigno has a sign when entering that says \"Cittá del Tartufo,\" which quite literally translates to \"City of Truffles.\"\n\nA visit to Appennino Food Group, a food production group explicitly known for its truffle exports, is a great way to plan an afternoon of truffle hunting with trained pups. The company was founded by Luigi Dattilo, who, at 17, refused his father's offer of a car and asked for a truffle dog instead.\n\nAs for tomatoes, Mutti, the famed canned tomato brand, has its headquarters in Parma. Plus, if you're looking to enjoy Parmigiano-Reggiano in its rightful birthplace, the only place in the world you can do just that is in Emilia-Romagna.\n\nTortellini has some roots here, too. There was a long-standing debate between Modena and Bologna about who made tortellini first. However, a popular legend holds that tortellini originated in Castelfranco Emilia, a small town between the two hubs.\n\nSome Italians theorize that tortellini's shape was inspired by Venus's belly button after she spent a night at an inn in town.\n\nAs someone who constantly craves a taste of Emilia-Romagna — and who spends a lot of time in Italy — I'm in the region often. I love trying new places, but I have a few favorite spots.\n\nOne is Franceschetta58 in Modena, known for its decadent tortellini en Parmigiana crema dish (where, yes, I do lick the plate clean every single time). For something more traditional, I prefer Sfoglia Rina in Bologna for tortellini en brodo.\n\nIn Parma, Salumeria Garibaldi is an ideal spot for a sip of Lambrusco, the region's most famed wine, paired with bites of prosciutto and mostarda.\n\nMeanwhile, an hour and a half away in Ferrara, check out Al Brindisi, a historic wine bar dating back to 1435, making it the world's oldest.\n\nDespite its prominent history, Al Brindisi has an unfussy feel, still preserving its medieval charm in a warm, welcoming atmosphere. Pro tip: Order the cappellacci di zucca, or pumpkin-stuffed pasta, a staple of Ferrarese cuisine.",

    "title": "I tried chicken tenders from 14 fast-food chains and ranked them from worst to best",
    "description": "We compared chicken tenders from 14 fast-food chains, from McDonald's and Chick-fil-A to Taco Bell.",
    "fullText": "The fast-food chicken wars have entered a new battleground — now, it's all about the tender.\n\nMcDonald's launched its McCrispy Strips in May last year, marking the first time chicken strips have been on the menu since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThen, a few months later, Wendy's launched its own Wendy's Tendys and a lineup of six new sauces made for dunking.\n\n\"Consumers told us what they wanted in a chicken tender, and we listened — taste-tested, fine-tuned, and delivered,\" Lindsay Radkoski, Wendy's US chief marketing officer, told Business Insider.\n\nI decided to compare chicken tenders from 14 fast-food chains across the country to see which were the best.\n\nHere's how the tenders ranked, from worst to best, based on taste and value.\n\nA three-piece chicken tender cost $7.48 at Whataburger at the location I visited in Austin.\n\nI thought the tenders could only be described as \"classic\" — they weren't anything out-of-the-box, but I enjoyed them.\n\nThe three-piece \"snack\" cost $4.99, not including tax.\n\nThey were also a good size. I thought the price was also a great deal for the generous portion I received.\n\nThese were undeniably classic chicken tenders, similar to the ones from Whataburger, but they were a touch too fried for my liking. However, I thought they were well-seasoned and had a lot of peppery flavor.\n\nAn order of three chicken tenders from Smashburger costs $9.99, excluding tax and fees. I thought this was a little pricey.\n\nThe breading on the chicken tenders felt thick and crunchy.\n\nThe chicken meat inside and the ranch dipping sauce provided could only do so much to offset the intense dryness of the crunchy breading.\n\nThe next time I order from Smashburger, I'll stick to the chain's beef offerings.\n\nA five-piece order of chicken tenders cost $8.41, excluding tax.\n\nRather than thick and juicy like some of the other chicken tenders I tried, these were flatter. In fact, I'd say these were the thinnest and flattest tenders out of all the ones I tried.\n\nThe chicken was on the drier side, and there simply wasn't a lot of it. I gravitate toward thicker, more shreddable chicken tenders, and these slightly missed the mark for me.\n\nHowever, the flavor was definitely there — the breading had a peppery essence and the tenders were evenly fried.\n\nA three-piece tender combo costs $16.89 before taxes and fees. The meal deal included a large serving of fries, a drink, and a biscuit, as well as a choice of dipping sauces.\n\nI really liked the crunchy exterior.\n\nI also thought the batter was quite flavorful — I could taste hints of seasoning and buttermilk, although they weren't quite as buttery-tasting as the Chick-fil-A tenders.\n\nHowever, this meal felt expensive for only three chicken tenders, even though they were large.\n\nA four-piece chicken tenders combo, including fries, a medium drink, and a biscuit, cost me $10.49, excluding taxes and fees.\n\nThe texture and flavor of the breading made them taste like a cross between the chicken tenders from Chick-fil-A and Cook Out.\n\nI also thought the price was fair, considering the amount of food I received. The chicken tenders paired perfectly with honey mustard but were also tasty on their own.\n\nI would definitely order these again.\n\nWendy's new tenders are available in a three-piece or four-piece option. I ordered a three-piece tender for $8.12, excluding tax and fees, at my local restaurant in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nHowever, I preferred the slightly thinner breading on the McDonald's and KFC tenders.\n\nIn terms of flavor, these tenders had a distinct peppery flavor that paired well with the new signature sauce introduced with the tenders' release.\n\nHowever, the slight lack of chicken meat inside — at least compared to other chains — and the chunky breading prevented Wendy's tenders from ranking higher for me.\n\nI ordered a four-piece tender meal for $13.65, excluding taxes and fees, in Brooklyn, New York. I thought this was excellent value for the amount of food I received.\n\nThe breading stuck closely to the chicken tenders, rather than having a thick or crunchy texture.\n\nHowever, the chicken tenders paired well with the chain's honey mustard and new comeback sauce. The breading had a tasty, very peppery flavor to it that was unique compared to the other chicken tenders I tried.\n\nHowever, the slightly less crispy texture of the breading meant they didn't come out on top when compared to the last six chains I tried.\n\nAt my local McDonald's in Brooklyn, New York, three McCrispy chicken strips cost $10.99, excluding tax and fees.\n\nThe chicken strips differed from the chain's buttermilk crispy tenders, which were discontinued in 2020 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nChicken tenders haven't been on the menu since, despite fans' pleas to bring them back.\n\nUnlike some flakier chicken tenders, each bite was evenly coated in well-seasoned, peppery breading. Inside, the chicken meat was thick and juicy.\n\nPaired with the chain's creamy chili sauce, which was specifically created to go with the chicken strips, these packed a decent amount of flavor.\n\nHowever, on their own, I thought they were just a touch blander than some of the higher-ranked tenders I tried.\n\nTaco Bell's chicken strips were available as part of three different kinds of tacos and burritos, or on their own with dipping sauce.\n\nAn order of four chicken strips and two sauces cost $9.14, excluding tax and fees.\n\nThe chicken strips were marinated in zesty jalapeño buttermilk and breaded with crispy tortilla chips and breadcrumbs, which is the same formula as the chain's chicken nuggets, which I ranked as my favorite across six chains.\n\nThe breading was super flavorful, and I definitely got hints of tortilla chip. The chicken inside was also moist and juicy, while the breading remained crispy.\n\nMy only real complaint was that I wanted more than two.\n\nWhen it's not included in a meal deal, a three-piece chicken tender costs $9.69 at my nearest location in New York City. For a meal, the price bumps up to $17.35, excluding tax and fees.\n\nSmall bits of fried breading were scattered on the outside, which I always love with chicken tenders.\n\nWhen I dipped them in the chain's signature Chick-fil-A sauce, the experience was mouthwatering.\n\nThe chicken tenders were also great on their own, with the perfect balance of crispy breading and a delicious, briny flavor. The sauce just took them over the edge.\n\nWingstop recently revamped its chicken tenders, and I was excited to try them out.\n\nThe chain sells its chicken in various flavors, from original hot to hickory-smoked barbecue and mango habanero. However, I ordered these chicken tenders plain.\n\nI ordered a five-piece chicken tender combo at my local Wingstop in Brooklyn, New York. It cost $15.39 and came with a drink, dipping sauce, and a regular side of fries.\n\nThe chain also sells four chicken tenders, which come with one dipping sauce, for $10.69, plus tax and fees.\n\nThe chicken tenders were deep golden in color and evenly fried, with small clumps of fried breading adding even more texture to every bite.\n\nThe chicken tender easily tore apart with every bite, which is something I look for. The breading itself was slightly peppery, but not overly flavorful. They paired well with Wingstop's signature ranch — my favorite of any fast-food ranch — and the chain's honey mustard.\n\nWingstop delivered great classic tenders, though the breading didn't pack as much flavor as the top two chains I tried. Nevertheless, I'd definitely order these again.\n\nA five-piece chicken tenders combo came with fries, a small drink, coleslaw, and a piece of Texas toast. I also asked for a side of honey mustard and Zaxby's famous Zax sauce.\n\nMy meal cost $15.43, excluding taxes and fees.\n\nZax sauce tastes similar to the Cane's sauce I tried from Raising Cane's, but I found it to be just ever-so-slightly less flavorful, and creamy. I also thought it didn't have the same kick.\n\nHowever, the chicken tenders really impressed me. They were a good size, extremely flavorful, and addictingly delicious. I found myself craving even more than the five chicken tenders I was given, which is rare for me.\n\nIn the end, it was a really tough call on whether I preferred Zaxby's or Raising Cane's chicken tenders.\n\nA combo that includes three chicken fingers, fries, Cane's sauce, Texas toast, and a regular drink costs $12.19, excluding tax and any additions or swaps.\n\nThe chicken tenders were also thick. After biting in, I could actually see the strips of white chicken underneath, which, in my experience, you don't always find with fast-food chicken tenders.",

Sure, the flights cost more than our actual honeymoon — they would've been around $10,000 before credit-card points — but we don't regret it.\n\nI now completely understand why the World Airline Awards have highlighted Qatar Airways as having the best business class in the world for multiple years in a row.\n\nThough we didn't have Q Suites, the business-class configuration on our first flight was still suite-style, in a 1-2-1 layout.\n\nThe suites felt modern and well-maintained. Later on in the flight, an attendant pulled a door across the side opening, which made it feel really private.\n\nEach business-class seat came with a cushion, a pillow, a plush blanket, a refreshing towelette, and a Diptyque toiletry bag.\n\nThe bag contained socks, an eye mask, earplugs, body lotion, face cream, perfume, and lip balm. There were also complimentary toothbrushes, shaving kits, and face sprays available to use in the restrooms.\n\nNot long after sitting down, we were greeted by the friendly staff and offered a drink. I opted for Champagne and was also brought a candy cane, which was a nice seasonal touch as we flew at the end of December.\n\nEach suite had a decent amount of storage and space — I'm 5'9\" and had ample legroom. The buttons by the sides of the seats made it easy to recline and adjust the leg rest.\n\nI also had a wireless charging phone holder; a cupboard containing a mirror, headphones, and a water bottle; and a stylish lamp.\n\nAs I browsed the movies, perused the food menu, and sipped my Champagne, I felt relaxed and excited. This was nothing like traveling in coach.\n\nDuring the six-hour flight, we were served one main meal that we could request whenever we wanted. (We could request a second meal, I later learned, though I didn't need it.)\n\nAs business-class travelers, we also had access to a basket of snacks, including popcorn and cereal bars, that we could help ourselves to at any time.\n\nPlus, we could order a range of wines, spirits, cocktails, and soft drinks whenever we wanted.\n\nBefore my meal began, I enjoyed more Champagne, served with crisps and nuts.\n\nAll the crockery and glassware felt elegant and sturdy — a far cry from foil containers and plastic cups.\n\nWhen it was time for the main meal, the staff pulled out my table, laid down a white tablecloth, then placed a (fake) candle and cutlery on top of it.\n\nFirst, I was brought a bread basket with butter, olive oil, and mini salt and pepper shakers. The butter was the perfect temperature for spreading, and the three types of bread were warm.\n\nI was then given a tasty mozzarella amuse-bouche.\n\nFor my starter, I had the Qatari mezze — pesto hummus, labneh tahini, and avocado muhammara — with pita bread. It was delicious and a sizable portion.\n\nFor the main course, I chose the grilled beef tenderloin with mashed potatoes, broccoli, asparagus, and parsley sauce. It was really good.\n\nI skipped the cheese course and opted for the fruit plate for dessert. We were offered chocolates, too.\n\nAfter dinner, I had a cup of tea and reclined to watch a film.\n\nThis first flight was in the daytime, so I didn't take as much advantage of having lie-flat seats.\n\nThe second was overnight, which is when I really appreciated my ability to lie down. The suite set-up felt nice and private, too.\n\nMy only qualm was that the space for my feet felt quite narrow and a bit constrictive. It wasn't a huge issue, though, and I still got some sleep.\n\nWe had a brief stopover in Doha on both our journeys, and I was impressed by how modern, clean, and slick the airport felt.\n\nWith our tickets, we had access to the Al Mourjan Business Lounge and its lounge overlooking the airport garden. We tried one on the way there and the other on the way back.\n\nThe lounges were beautiful, and we got complimentary delicious food and Champagne. I actually wish we'd had longer layovers to take advantage of the lounge's gym, spa, showers, and sleep rooms.\n\nFor the second leg of our journey to Vietnam, we were on an older plane. The business-class seats weren't suites; they were in a 2-2-2 layout.\n\nWe still had lots of legroom, but this flight didn't feel as chic — it had fewer modern touches, and I missed the wireless phone charger I enjoyed on the first one.\n\nSince this was a nighttime flight, Qatar Airways provided business-class passengers with pajamas and slippers to keep. I really enjoyed this extra touch.\n\nThe staff also arranged my seat into a bed with a mattress topper and pillow, which was lovely. I normally never sleep on planes, but I got a couple of hours on each flight.\n\nI actually preferred the older business-class seat for sleeping since my feet weren't as restricted at the end.\n\nThese two round-trip flights for two people should've cost about $10,000, which is undoubtedly a lot of money.\n\nWe'd been saving our credit-card points for a long time, so we were able to take a lot of money off that price, but this was still a splurge.\n\nEven though these tickets cost a lot, they felt worth it. Flying business class made the journeys really special — something to look forward to and enjoy, not just a way of getting from A to B.\n\nSure, this experience might make going back to economy a bit painful, but I'm so glad to have done it. I would definitely fly business class again for a special occasion or if I had a lot of points.",

    "fullText": "Wendy’s announced Friday it will close between 298 and 358 U.S. restaurants in the first half of this year, representing roughly 5% to 6% of its domestic locations, as the fast-food chain works to reverse a significant sales decline, the Associated Press reports.\n\nThe Dublin, Ohio-based company reported that global same-store sales at locations open for at least a year fell 10% during the October-December period, exceeding the 8.5% drop analysts had anticipated, according to the publication. U.S. sales declined even more sharply during that timeframe.\n\nThe closures add to the 28 restaurants Wendy’s shuttered in the fourth quarter, leaving the company with 5,969 U.S. locations at the end of 2025. The chain also closed 240 restaurants in 2024.\n\nWendy’s is now emphasizing value to win back inflation-weary customers, a tactic also employed by competitors McDonald’s and Taco Bell, according to the AP. In January, the company rolled out a permanent “Biggie Deals” value menu with items priced at $4, $6, and $8.\n\n“One learning from 2025 around value, we swung the pendulum too far towards limited-time price promotions instead of everyday value,” said Ken Cook, Wendy’s interim CEO and chief financial officer, during a call with investors.\n\nCook added that the company plans to introduce new products this year, including a new chicken sandwich.\n\nDespite the sales slump, Wendy’s fourth-quarter revenue of $543 million topped analyst forecasts of $537 million, though it marked a 5.5% decrease, according to AP. The company projects global systemwide sales will be flat this year after falling 3.5% last year, expressing confidence that its turnaround plan and international expansion will halt the sales decline.\n\nWendy’s shares rose nearly 5% during mid-day trading Friday following the announcement, AP noted.",

    "fullText": "Countless businesses met their end as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with even larger chains taking a hit as the world shut down. A new study is purporting that several restaurant chains are bouncing back years after the global pandemic, including one that has seen a decline in San Antonio.\n\nThe study, conducted by Restaurant Furniture, looked at Google search trends between 2021 and 2025. Based on the data, the company ranked the 10 chains that saw the biggest jumps in search interest. Oklahoma-based Sonic Drive-In topped the list, with searches reportedly soaring 1,601% over four years. Some might call Sonic the comeback kid, but things look a bit different in the Alamo City.\n\nDespite these findings, the Sonic Drive-In has seen many closures across San Antonio in recent years, with locations on De Zavala Road, Zarzamora Street, Ingram Road, Nacogdoches Road, Pat Booker Road and Culebra Road all closing since 2024, based on previous MySA reporting. At the time of writing, Sonic Drive-In lists 37 locations as still open in San Antonio.\n\nAs for other fast-food chains' comeback stories, the restaurant study had Dunkin' and Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers in the second and third, respectively, followed by In-N-Out Burger and Jimmy John's. In an extended version of the list, Texas-based burger chain Whataburger landed in the No. 15 spot.\n\nThis article originally published at Nation's No. 1 comeback fast-food chain is stumbling in San Antonio.",

    "fullText": "Florida's orange harvest is expected to be the smallest since 1930 because of major declines in healthy trees, affecting both farmers and consumers across the United States and Canada.\n\nAccording to Insurance Journal, which cited data from the Department of Agriculture, the state will have an estimated output of 12 million boxes of oranges this season — a 2% decline compared to last season.\n\nSince around 2000, Florida's orange groves have been shrinking because of a devastating, incurable bacterial infection called citrus greening disease, which kills tree roots and stunts growth. The disease causes fruits to be smaller, greener, and bitter, making them essentially unsellable.\n\nRapid urban development has also led to the removal of many orange groves, and damage from intense hurricanes — for example, Ian, Nicole, and Milton — since 2022 has further destroyed trees.\n\nInsurance Journal reported that treatments have helped some trees recover, but that hasn't been enough to restore yields to their former levels.\n\n\"It'll be a process to see the overall fruit count increase,\" Matt Joyner, CEO of Florida Citrus Mutual, told the news outlet. \"That's going to take a number of years to get that broader number up.\"\n\nFarmers depend on healthy crops for their livelihoods, but the financial strain from poor harvests has forced many out of business, according to WUSF. Remaining farmers are frustrated by the lack of breakthroughs in research to combat the disease as well as by other losses due to worsening storms and erratic weather.\n\nFood and Wine reported that hurricanes have been especially brutal in the Sunshine State since 2020, reflecting the impact of rising global temperatures on orange yields.\n\n\"It can take up to three to five years for a damaged tree to recover from an extreme weather event (if it survives at all) and return to peak production,\" Marisa Zansler, the Florida Department of Citrus' director of economic and market research, told the magazine.\n\nSmaller harvests usually mean more expensive grocery prices, though Insurance Journal reported that orange juice futures have dropped significantly as Brazil, the world's top orange exporter, expects a major boost in production.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nRecent cold snaps and hurricanes have also resulted in millions of dollars in losses for vegetable, potato, melon, and strawberry farmers throughout Florida.\n\nAccording to WUSF, Florida lawmakers are working to pass a bill that would reduce the minimum sugar content required for orange juice, the end product for much of the state's harvests. Fresh oranges in grocery stores are more likely to come from California, and the USDA predicts a high output from the state this year, which should stabilize prices.\n\nScientists have also been experimenting with genetically modified orange trees that can withstand or resist citrus greening. They say it could be the breakthrough the industry needs to stay afloat amid rising production costs and increasingly frequent and severe extreme weather.\n\nKeeping tabs on how the climate impacts orange harvests will help you know what to expect at the grocery store and shop smarter.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Inspired by my quest to find the best Ina Garten pasta recipes, I decided to do the same with Gordon Ramsay.\n\nWhile the celebrity chef is more frequently associated with his famous beef Wellington, he also knows how to whip up a quick and delicious Bolognese.\n\nI tried five of his pasta dishes — including three that were ready in 15 minutes or less — and ranked them from least to most delicious.\n\nThe Bloody Mary is one of Ramsay's favorite cocktails, so he decided to whip up a pasta that channeled its iconic flavors.\n\n\"This makes an unusual starter or main and just shows how even the most familiar dishes — in this case pasta and tomato sauce — can be updated,\" the chef writes in his \"Ultimate Home Cooking\" cookbook.\n\nRamsay's Bloody Mary pasta features linguine, vodka, celery salt, and Worcestershire and Tabasco sauces, as well as handmade toasted breadcrumbs.\n\nA great Bloody Mary cocktail is full of salt and heat, a burst of flavor that can conquer any hangover. Unfortunately, Ramsay's pasta pales in comparison.\n\nWhile I appreciated the ease of this recipe, the dish lacked depth. The diced tomatoes left the sauce too thin, and I barely got a kick of heat from the Tabasco. Overall, this pasta was just too plain — I'll be sticking to the cocktail.\n\nHow to make Gordon Ramsay's Bloody Mary linguine.\n\nRamsay's shrimp scampi is one of the pasta recipes in his cookbook \"Ramsay in 10,\" which features dishes that can be made in just 10 minutes.\n\nIn addition to shrimp and angel-hair pasta, the dish includes cherry tomatoes, basil, capers, shallots, and lemon zest and juice.\n\nWith its bright pops of color and the scent of freshly squeezed lemon, Ramsay's shrimp scampi transported me to a seaside taverna in August. The pasta tasted light and zesty, and I loved the texture of the blistered tomatoes.\n\nI recommend adding more chili flakes to this recipe for just a bit more pop, and make sure to carefully watch your angel hair — it can get sticky if it cooks for too long.\n\nHow to make Gordon Ramsay's 10-minute shrimp scampi.\n\nRamsay's cacio e pepe only requires 30 minutes and five basic ingredients — butter, bucatini, black peppercorns, plus Parmesan and pecorino cheeses — but the chef set out to prove that \"quick food doesn't mean bland and one-dimensional.\"\n\n\"Producing restaurant-quality meals in half an hour can be a challenge,\" Ramsay writes in his \"Quick and Delicious\" cookbook. \"But there are ways around this if you know how: choose the right ingredients, marry them with the right combination of spices and sauces, use the right cooking method, and you can produce incredibly tasty meals that tick all the boxes.\"\n\nRamsay really elevates this cacio e pepe with the homemade Parmesan crisps, which added a nice contrast of texture to the chewy bucatini noodles. I also loved the sauce, which tasted silky smooth with the simple addition of some pasta water.\n\n\"Cacio e pepe translates as 'cheese and pepper,' and that's essentially all that goes into this sauce,\" Ramsay writes in the recipe description. \"The magic ingredient that binds them together is the pasta cooking water. It is full of starch, which emulsifies with the butter and helps the sauce cling to the pasta.\"\n\nHow to make Gordon Ramsay's cacio e pepe.\n\nRamsay loves this turkey and leek pasta so much that he said he makes it for his family every week.\n\n\"For a change, skip the Bolognese and make this creamy turkey and leek sauce in a fraction of the time instead,\" he writes in the \"Ramsay in 10\" cookbook. \"It might just become a regular midweek family meal, as it has at my house.\"\n\nThe 10-minute dish features either penne or fusilli pasta, plus ground turkey, leeks, shallots, garlic, lemon, Parmesan cheese, and homemade sage breadcrumbs.\n\nI don't usually crave poultry with my pasta, but Ramsay's dish showed me what I've been missing.\n\nThe turkey and leek sauce was light but bright, thanks to the sweetness of the leeks and the zing from the lemon, and the sage breadcrumbs added an extra layer of depth to the overall flavor.\n\nI whipped up this pasta while visiting my family, and everyone loved it — no wonder Ramsay makes it every week!\n\nHow to make Gordon Ramsay's turkey and leek pasta.\n\nMy family and I discovered this 15-minute Bolognese while watching episodes of \"Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Cookery Course\" at the start of the pandemic.\n\nThe dish only requires a few basic ingredients — dried tagliatelle pasta, sausage, tomatoes, garlic, and onion. I also like to add a can of crushed tomatoes and some parsley if I have them on hand.\n\nA typical Bolognese can take hours to simmer, but Ramsay's recipe develops so much flavor at a fraction of the time. The dish takes very little prep — five minutes or less — and the sauce still comes out comforting, rich, and delicious every time.\n\nMy parents loved this pasta so much that my dad started making it almost every week after we first tried it. And no matter how many dishes I've tested on them, this is still one of their all-time favorites.\n\n\"It feels like home,\" my mom told me.\n\nHow to make Gordon Ramsay's 15-minute sausage Bolognese.",

    "fullText": "It’s been about a month since Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—an anti-vaccine activist and lawyer who has no background in medicine, health, or science—released dietary guidance for Americans. It’s going about as well as expected for a man who drinks raw milk, peddles beef tallow, swims in sewage-tainted water, and keeps roadkill meat in his freezer. That is to say, it’s going badly—so badly that even his favorite AI chatbot is openly defecting.\n\nOf course, this hasn’t slowed Kennedy. On Wednesday, he and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins held an event in Washington, DC, to celebrate what they called the “implementation” of the dietary guidance, which is represented in an upside-down food pyramid—or a funnel.\n\nHowever, the event, which lasted about an hour, seemed mostly focused on honoring a commercial produced to promote the nutrition guidance and a new website showcasing it, RealFood.gov. That commercial, which aired during last weekend’s Super Bowl, featured tightly framed shots of world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, who made stigmatizing remarks about how he felt “fat and nasty” earlier in life and consequently “just wanted to kill myself.” He went on to decry America’s “obese, fudgy” people and lambasted “processed food,” before eating an apple.\n\nTyson was the featured speaker at Wednesday’s event, appearing behind the podium for about two minutes at the end. The lineup also included the commercial’s director, Brett Ratner, who was pushed out of Hollywood over numerous sexual assault allegations but recently produced a documentary on Melania Trump. Also present was Joe Gebbia, a co-founder of Airbnb, who joined Elon Musk’s DOGE and was said to be the person behind the design of the food funnel and new website.\n\nRollins and Kennedy also spoke, standing beside large posters of themselves sporting facial tattoos matching Tyson’s. Kennedy began his remarks by proclaiming that “for the first time in our nation’s history, the federal government put real food at the center of the American diet and protein in the center of the American plate.”\n\nSome in the nutrition and health fields have supported Kennedy’s fight against ultra-processed foods. But the bulk of the changes Kennedy made to the dietary guidance and funnel representation relate to glorifying fat and protein, drawing criticism that the updates are harmful and lack supporting evidence.\n\nAmong the critics is a notable AI chatbot. Kennedy’s new website, RealFood.gov, prods users to “use AI to get real answers about real food.” Entering a question into a text box and clicking “ask” redirects users to Grok, Elon Musk’s AI tool that has been shown to generate child sexual abuse material.\n\nAs for Grok’s take on nutrition, its answers do indeed get real. In short, Grok indicates that Kennedy’s new nutrition guidelines are not based on high-quality evidence—which is true—and that Kennedy is not a reliable source of nutrition information. He is, in fact, not trustworthy on health information generally, according to the chatbot. And when Grok designed a daily meal plan to fit Kennedy’s food funnel, it subsequently admitted that the plan contained excessive amounts of saturated fat and protein while falling short of the recommended fiber intake, which Americans are generally already short on.\n\nWhen asked if Kennedy’s guidance is based on high-quality research, the chatbot says it’s a mixed bag. An emphasis on ” whole, minimally processed foods, increase[d] fruits/vegetables, choos[ing] whole grains, and sharply limit[ing] added sugars, highly processed foods, and sugary drinks, aligns well with a broad consensus in high-quality research,” Grok responded. But it also includes “hype around protein and saturated fats that goes beyond (or contradicts) the advisory committee’s evidence summary” and instead reflects “decisions by the administration,” the chatbot said.\n\nWhen asked to generate a generic daily meal plan based on Kennedy’s food funnel, Grok suggested:\n\nThe heavy emphasis on full-fat dairy, including butter, aligns with Kennedy’s rhetoric. But the written guidance actually maintains the long-standing recommendation that Americans limit their saturated fat (found at high levels in full-fat dairy) to less than 10 percent of their total calories. For a standard 2,000-calorie diet, that would be less than 22 grams a day. When asked if the generated menu adheres to that recommendation, Grok said no. In fact, based on the options, it could be more than double, potentially exceeding 50 grams.\n\nWhat about protein? That, too, is generally over the limit. Recommended protein intake varies depending on factors such as weight, age, exercise level, and pregnancy status. But a general recommendation has been to get 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight, or about 0.36 grams per pound. Americans generally already meet this recommendation. Kennedy’s guidance increases protein to 1.2 to 1.6 g/kg (or about 0.54 to 0.72 g/lb).\n\nFor a 150-pound person, the old and new recommendations for daily protein are 54 g and 81 g–108 g, respectively. (The USDA has a calculator here for your own recommendations, which still uses the old protein recommendation.) Grok’s interpretation of Kennedy’s guidance produced a menu with up to 180 grams of protein per day.\n\nWhile the meal plan exceeded recommendations for saturated fat and protein, it fell short on fiber, a critical nutrient Americans already eat too little of. In fact, most Americans eat less than half of the recommended amount of fiber, which is found in fruits, vegetables, grains, and beans. The new guidance maintains daily fiber recommendations, which are generally 25 g for women and 38 g for men. But Grok’s “realistic” estimate for fiber in its meal plan had a range of 25 to 35 grams, falling short for men.\n\nOverall, Grok concluded that “based on extensive fact-checks and expert consensus, RFK Jr. is not a reliable source on health matters. His claims often lack evidence, promote distrust in institutions, and have led to harmful outcomes.”\n\nSo where does that leave Americans looking for trustworthy nutrition advice? Grok helpfully notes that “Many experts still prefer alternatives like Harvard’s Healthy Eating Plate, which prioritizes plants more heavily and limits red meat/dairy based on extensive epidemiological data.”",

    "fullText": "There are two fewer places to grab a quick bite near downtown Fresno and Highway 99.\n\nThe KFC and Wendy’s on C and Fresno streets — which operated next door to each other for years — are now closed. The windows are boarded up and the buildings are surrounded by chain-link fence. The signs are gone, only the metal frames remaining. Weeds are starting to grow.\n\nNeither the local management nor the parent company returned messages seeking comment about the closures, which happened in recent weeks.\n\nBut Wendy’s is in the process of closing hundreds of underperforming locations nationwide. It started the closures last year .\n\nIt could close between 240 and 360 restaurants, according to ABC news. It follows a tide of 140 Wendy’s closures that ended in 2024.\n\nThe most recent closures include locations owned by franchisees, said Ken Cook, interim chief executive officer, when announcing the cutbacks in the 2025 third-quarter earnings call in November.\n\nThe underperforming restaurants are a financial drag on the brand, he said. The shutdowns are expected to boost sales at nearby Wendy’s, he said.\n\n“In (some) cases, the solution will be to close consistently underperforming restaurants,” he said in the call. “These actions will strengthen the system and enable franchisees to invest more capital and resources in their remaining restaurants.”\n\nThe closures are a reaction to Wendy’s sales falling 4.7% according to its latest quarterly report. Its rivals, including McDonald’s and Burger King, saw sales rise.\n\nLast month, Wendy’s in Selma, and on Dinuba Boulevard in Visalia also closed, according to the Mid Valley Times.\n\nNo additional Wendy’s locations have been identified for closure in Fresno. JEM Restaurant Management, which owns numerous Wendy’s and KFC franchises in Fresno, did not immediately return calls seeking comment.\n\nWendy’s still has a healthy presence in town, with seven restaurants open in Fresno and one in Clovis.\n\nThe KFC at 1110 C St. has also closed.\n\nIt follows the closure of three other locations in Fresno: The “Next-gen” location Herndon and Spruce avenues, another at First Street and Bullard Avenue, and one at Dakota and West avenues.\n\nAll were owned by JEM Restaurant Management.\n\nThe classic fried chicken chain has struggled in recent years with slipping sales. But the last two quarters, KFC has turned things around, squeezing out an increase in sales.\n\nKFC has six locations in Fresno and two in Clovis.",

    "title": "The Best Kitchen Gadgets to Make Cooking Weeknight Dinners So Much Easier",
    "description": "Reduce your labor and make midweek meals a lot easier.",
    "fullText": "Cooking can be a creative outlet, a way of showing affection, and a way to take control of your health. But cooking can also be stressful and time-consuming, especially on a weeknight when you're already exhausted from a long day at work and you've got a hungry family (or just yourself) to feed. Ordering in is always tempting, but that gets expensive and can have an adverse impact on your waistline.\n\nYou might already have some of the more obvious and established time-saving appliances in your kitchen, but you can always shave a few more minutes and adrenaline spikes off your nightly cook. These kitchen gadgets will make cooking weeknight dinners easier no matter what the menu looks like.\n\nIf you have ever had a weeknight dinner go off the rails due to a pot of pasta accidentally dumped in the sink during a straining misadventure, know that snap-on strainers exist. Just pop one onto your pot, and you can easily strain without worrying about the dreaded dump out (or a fourth-degree burn from pasta water). These strainers are flexible and will fit just about any pot or pan you need to strain out of.\n\nCooking is often a series of dull, repetitive tasks, and sometimes those tasks need to be performed simultaneously—so why not at least outsource all that pot stirring? This battery-operated device does just what it says: You place it in your pot or pan, press the button, and it stirs anything that needs it while you go and live your life (or chop vegetables).\n\nHere's a mistake I make over and over again when prepping sauces, stock, or soup for future dinners: I forget to divide it up before I pop it in the freezer. When it's time to make that weekday dinner, I have plenty of pre-made sauce—or, rather, I have too much of it, and I either defrost the whole bit and waste some or try hacking off a piece. Enter: Souper Cubes. These are like ice cube trays for food, and make it easy to freeze precise amounts of prepped or leftover food.\n\nAnyone who cooks regularly has the minor wounds and scars to show for it—including the tell-tale burns from hurriedly grabbing stuff from a hot oven. Oven rack guards allow you to throw caution to the wind when pulling trays out of a crowded oven, even when reaching into a lower rack or grabbing something that's migrated to the rear of the oven.\n\nIf an automated pot stirrer is cool, a cooker that also stirs itself is even cooler. If your life goals include being able to make dinner every night while somehow doing other things, this is the kitchen appliance you need. It can cook a wide range of meals more or less on its own, and will stir meals automatically. Just load up your ingredients, set your parameters, and walk away.\n\nCooking using canned ingredients is nothing to be ashamed of, but opening all those cans can be a chore that keeps you away from other cooking tasks. Enter the automatic can opener—just pop it on a can, press the button, and let it do its thing while you do literally anything more useful with your time.\n\nIf your dinner plans involve more than one dish, you know the stress of being on the clock when something is ready long before the rest of the meal. Serving up cold sides or sauces is no fun, so a warming mat like this is the answer. Just place dishes on it as they're ready and keep working on the balance of the meal, and everything will still be piping hot by the time you're ready to sit down.\n\nWe've all been there: You need to fry up several different things, but you only have one skillet. Your choice is to desperately cook and put aside each portion of the meal, or get yourself a divided non-stick skillet that makes it easy to cook several things simultaneously, speeding up your dinner process and ensuring that everything hits the table hot and ready.\n\nIf you're like me and you consistently forget to plan ahead when it comes to thawing out frozen ingredients ahead of time, you also know the struggle of trying to speed up the process. Submerging frozen meat in cold water is a proven way of speeding up the thawing process—unless your frozen goods just float to the surface. Enter the Thaw Claw, a simple device that clamps your frozen food to the bottom of your sink or bowl so it can defrost more quickly and effectively.\n\nSaving time when cooking dinner is all about accumulating small wins. The time spent weighing and measuring all the ingredients for your meal adds up, so having a digital measuring spoon can make the process faster and more efficient, since you won't have to place anything on a scale, adjust, and then use a separate implement to transfer it to your pots and skillets. Just measure as you scoop and keep moving.\n\nCleanup is part of the time and effort of any mid-week meal, and if you were tired before you started making dinner, you're not going to be less tired after eating. So make cleanup a little easier with Fry Away, which makes disposing of all that grease and oil a very simple process: Add some to hot oil or grease, let it cool, and then peel off the somewhat gross results and toss into the trash. Not having a jar of old oil sitting on the kitchen counter (or not calling a plumber to clean your drains if you're too lazy to have a jar of old oil on your kitchen counter) or needing to scrub away at a greasy pan? This is the way.",

    "description": "The White House and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have a new protein-forard food pyramid that they say you can follow cheaply. I tried it out.",
    "fullText": "I didn't set out to follow a political diet, or any diet at all, really. But it was January, the new food pyramid was out, and according to the people in charge, it was healthy and easy to do on the cheap. Plus, I like a challenge.\n\nAt the start of the year, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. announced the federal government's new dietary guidelines for how Americans should aspire to eat. The gist: meat, full fats, and whole foods are in; sugars, processed foods, and excess carbs are out. After complaints that the recommendations leaned toward pricier food categories, the Secretary of Agriculture said you could follow the new protocol for as little as $3 a meal. I had my doubts, given grocery prices and inflation. Apparently she (or her staff) did, too, because Rollins later amended her indications to $15.64 a day.\n\nDespite my reservations, I decided to try it myself. For seven days, I would follow what I came to think of as the \"RFK diet\" on a $15-a-day budget to see just how realistic this whole thing was. Would I have regrets? Of course. Would I learn something? Honestly, yes — among other things, that spices are my friend, that I don't like apples that much, and that food is more political and emotional than we realize. Our identities, beliefs, and social statuses are wound up in every single decision we make, including what's for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\n\nI am not used to making a weekly grocery haul. One of the blessings of living in New York City is that there's usually a store close enough that it's fine to make multiple trips a week. This makes up for one of the curses of NYC, which is that most people don't have a car, so whatever you buy, you carry. So I enlist AI's help to ensure I don't miss anything and to make my spending calculations easier. I input the new guidance, explain my financial constraints, and the machine spits out a shopping list. As I scribble it down, I decide that a line from ChatGPT will be my shopping philosophy: \"This is not maximal pleasure. This is maximal compliance + realism.\"\n\nOnce I've hit the aisles, I adopt a second shopping philosophy: undershoot the budget. I can spend up to $105, but I wind up paying $70.31, leaving myself a $34.69 emergency fund in case things go awry. I'm actually pretty close to that initial $3-a-meal estimate, which would have left me with a $63 weekly budget.\n\nSince, besides the federal government, I am the one making the rules here, I decide on some adjustments. I'll use the olive oil, butter, salt, pepper, and spices already in my apartment because part of thrift is utilizing the resources you already have. The same goes for my already-owned instant coffee that will serve as a vehicle for whole milk. Moderate alcohol consumption is not an official budget consideration, but it seems fine since Dr. Oz says it's allowed and Dry January is passé. Price, quality, and availability are a delicate balance — I buy the cheapest peanut butter and ignore the ingredients list, which is surely not RFK Jr.-approved.\n\nAfter making some tough calls, this is my haul:\n\nIt would have made more sense to start this on a Monday morning, but there was a big snowstorm over the weekend, so Tuesday night kickoff it is. I start with some manageable basics, meaning I boil six eggs and rice and put them in the fridge, and I pick an easy recipe. Spoiler alert: I'm a terrible cook, so this is going to be a journey.\n\nI've never been much of a food prepper (or life prepper), so I'm pretty impressed with myself for what I'd imagine others might consider a pathetic performance. My dinner is decent. ChatGPT has armed me with a plan for my leftovers. I have not yet over-potatoed, nor am I aware that sentiment is on the horizon.\n\nDinner: Roasted chicken breast with potatoes and carrots\n\nThe vibe: Cautiously optimistic, until I remember this plan does not allow for dessert.\n\nMy AI-assisted meal plans tell me I have a variety of breakfast options. My heart tells me I have only one — bread with peanut butter — which I fear may be the culinary highlight of my week. A midday trip to the dentist and the accompanying novocaine make me nervous about the lunch situation, but luckily, my meal is basically mush — chicken, rice, and peas. I make a different combination of ingredients into what appears to be a largely identical plate of mush for dinner, and set aside the leftovers from my lunchtime mush for the office tomorrow.\n\nAt some point during all of this, I realize that I have the ingredients for an actual good mush: mashed potatoes. This is very exciting. Post-dinner, I notice a coworker's Instagram story of his New York Times-inspired creamy lasagna soup creation, which fits neither my diet nor my budget. My excitement fades.\n\nBreakfast: 1 piece of toast with peanut butter, coffee with milk\n\nLunch: Chicken breast, rice, and peas\n\nSnack: 1 apple, 2 slices cheddar cheese\n\nDinner: Ground beef skillet with onion, carrot, cabbage, and rice\n\nThe vibe: This is a lot like how I ate when I was broke in my 20s. I remember why I'm not a big fan of peas. Thank God for cheese.\n\nI've reached the \"bargaining\" stage of this endeavor quicker than I thought. I catch myself looking at the new and improved food pyramid multiple times throughout the day to see if there's something affordable but delicious that I'm missing. Broccoli? An avocado? The official guidelines list kimchi, which seems like the coastal political elite seeping through. Also, it's $10 in the grocery store, so no.\n\nChatGPT assures me the free seltzer water in my office is allowed, which is a treat. When someone in the office announces there are free Girl Scout cookies on her desk, I don't bother asking the robot if that's OK, because I already know the answer. I meet a friend for drinks after work and, somewhat ashamedly, explain that I can't stay for dinner because I pitched what I have now definitely decided was a very stupid idea. I will probably cheat sooner rather than later, but not yet.\n\nBreakfast: 2 hard-boiled eggs, coffee with milk\n\nSnack: 1 apple that I spent $1 on because I did not plan and forgot to bring one from home\n\nDinner: Ground beef skillet with onion, carrot, cabbage, and rice\n\nVibe: I have to find a way to mix this up tomorrow.\n\nThe point of food isn't just nourishment — it's pleasure. This is a sensation that this diet is severely lacking.\n\nIn the midst of my desperation, I text Morgan Dickison, a registered dietitian at Weill Cornell Medicine, to ask for advice. The first thing she asks after I show her my food diary is whether I'm hungry, which I'm not — I'm having some pretty big portions, and the food isn't exactly triggering additional cravings. She suggests seeking out some herbs, spices, and flavored oils, budget permitting. This prompts me to take a harder look at the spices in my cabinet to see what I might be able to incorporate. Her most specific recommendation: Rao's tomato sauce — it's not ultra-processed, and there's no added sugar. (This is not the case, unfortunately, with Rao's pesto.) She also low-key recommends I cool it on so much red meat. I wonder what RFK would say.\n\nI head to the grocery store to buy Rao's, but over the course of my five-minute walk, I forget why I'm there. I leave with chicken, an avocado, broccoli, two tomatoes, and corn tortillas, totaling $12.62. I have $22.07 left. Plus the $1 apple, so $21.07. Despite blanking on the sauce, the Morgan consultation/pep talk inspires what has been my best meal yet. Things may be looking up.\n\nBreakfast: 1 piece of toast with peanut butter, coffee with milk\n\nLunch: Beef skillet with onion, carrot, and lentils\n\nSnack: Hard-boiled egg, 2 slices cheddar cheese\n\nDinner: Grilled chicken breast with mashed potatoes\n\nVibe: Real live dietitian >>>>> AI.\n\nI am pretty committed to this bit, but I also don't want to be a freak. After a glass of wine at the Westminster dog show agility preliminaries (which is awesome), I realize I have to eat something, lest I be too buzzed to enjoy the amateur canine obstacle courses. I get an $8 chicken empanada, which almost certainly breaks the rules. I decide the day has no more rules and go out for dinner.\n\nBreakfast: 1 corn tortilla with 2 slices of cheddar cheese, in a quesadilla-type situation\n\nVibe: Between the very agile dogs and my cheat meal, I have had a great day.\n\nI wake feeling more confident about this experiment, thanks to my Friday dinner semi-success and probably the glow of Saturday's rule-breaking. I make an actually good brunch-type situation, and by \"I make\" I mean I generally start some things and then my boyfriend, a much better cook, takes over.\n\nFor dinner, it's too cold to go to the store, so I manage to scrounge up the ingredients from my boyfriend's brothers' apartment to make pasta and homemade pasta sauce. I use it to concoct the chicken Parmesan I've been thinking about since my failed Friday Rao's trip. I'm not sure if this is completely allowed, with the pasta (which is organic!) and also chicken breading, but I'm following along in spirit.\n\nBrunch: Mashed potato hashbrowns, scrambled eggs, 1 corn tortilla, ¼ avocado\n\nVibe: There is light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nPart of what set this exercise in motion was comments from Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, where she recommended a meal composed of a piece of chicken, a piece of broccoli, a corn tortilla, and \"one other thing.\" This is what I choose for my lunch finale, adding a quarter of an avocado as my \"other thing.\" It's pretty good, though I have to embiggen it from the description to make it actually filling.\n\nBreakfast: 1 corn tortilla with 2 slices of cheddar cheese, ¼ avocado\n\nLunch: The Brooke Rollins Special — 1 corn tortilla, chicken, broccoli, and ¼ avocado\n\nDinner: Ground beef and chickpea skillet with broccoli\n\nDoing the RFK diet on a $105-a-week food plan was not as hard as I thought it would be. I came in under budget by $13, even with the mid-week grocery trips and the dog show empanada (and not counting the Sunday freebies or Saturday cheat meal). But being on such a strict diet and budget did lead to some notable limitations. My regimen lacked any appreciable amount of variety, and it made eating into an act focused almost exclusively on survival.\n\nI ask Dickison, the dietitian, for a final rating of my adventure once I wrap it up. She says that, like a lot of people, I have room for improvement with fruits and veggies, commends my integration of chickpeas and lentils, and says I did a good job with protein at every meal, even if I was too heavy on ground beef. The budget piece of this undertaking is the hardest part, she says. It makes it challenging to incorporate some of the new food pyramid recommendations, such as berries, fresh vegetables, and fish, and it's not aligned with how people live. \"When I'm speaking with patients, we talk about all the different ways that you get food,\" she says. Sure, sometimes it's cooking at home, but it's also fast casual at the office, a restaurant on a night out, or delivery when people are pressed for time. \"The more convenient the option, the more expensive it gets,\" she says.\n\nWhat's also unrealistic: The ability to religiously follow such a rigid diet for an extended period of time. Hunger levels and cravings matter. \"It can be really difficult to manage those biological drives and also this premeditated budget, even if you did have the best intentions,\" Dickison says. I wish I could text her every day for food advice, but I fear she would block my number.\n\nThis funny little food journey of mine has coincided with a giant internet debate about some people using DoorDash too much and others scolding them for not cooking more at home. After a week of being bound to team cook-at-home, I'm overly sympathetic to team DoorDash, if only because I've spent the past week envisioning the treat I'm about to get myself — via my delivery app of choice, Seamless — now that this is all over. Variety is, as the eye-rolling adage goes, the spice of life. Being able to switch up not only the dish but also the delivery method from time to time is part of that.\n\nThe experience has made clear the sacrifices we constantly make around affordability, sustenance, and gratification when it comes to food. The cheapest option is never the healthiest option. The healthiest option is never the most thrilling option. The most thrilling option may be the cheapest, but it's usually bad for you.\n\nIt's an economic issue as much as it is cultural and political. When people on the lower end of the income spectrum — or public benefits — are told to focus on whole-food basics, they're told to give up on ease and joy as well. When people rely too much on delivery, they're almost certainly overspending, but they do so because it saves time and energy compared to an elaborate kitchen production. It's true that it's generally better to cook real meals with fresh ingredients at home. It's also true that life is complicated, and for a variety of reasons, that's not always possible. I probably could have stretched my budget just as far, if not farther, with frozen, preprepared options.\n\nUltimately, for most of us, dinner is less of an ideological project than it is a daily logistical problem — one that has to be solved, night after night, in perpetuity.\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "fullText": "The US Food and Drug Administration has refused to accept an application from Moderna to review its first mRNA seasonal flu vaccine, the company said Tuesday, in another setback for the technology that’s been a target of some Trump administration health officials.\n\nThe agency told Moderna that its application didn’t contain an “adequate and well-controlled” trial because the control arm didn’t reflect the “best-available standard of care in the United States at the time of the study,” according to a letter dated February 3 that Moderna posted online. It didn’t identify any safety or efficacy concerns, the company said.\n\nModerna said that the refusal was inconsistent with previous feedback from the agency and that it had requested a meeting with FDA officials to understand how to proceed.\n\n“The complete stunner here is at no point in any of this did anybody say that it was not adequate” to run its clinical trial the way it had discussed with the agency, Moderna’s president, Dr. Stephen Hoge, told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services said “the FDA generally does not comment on regulatory communications to individual sponsors.” It’s rare for the FDA to issue a “refuse-to-file” letter; a 2021 study of almost 2,500 applications submitted to the agency found that only 4% received such letters.\n\nModerna used a standard-dose seasonal flu vaccine called Fluarix as a comparator in a 40,700-person clinical trial to demonstrate the experimental mRNA vaccine’s safety and efficacy. The company said the FDA had agreed with that plan in April 2024 but suggested it also include data comparing its vaccine with an approved high-dose flu vaccine for people over 65, which the company said it did.\n\nModerna added that as recently as August, in a meeting before it submitted its application for approval of the vaccine, the FDA suggested that it would review the filing and assess issues with the comparator during that process. The agency did note that there could be a “significant issue” with the data “during review” of the application, according to written feedback that Moderna shared.\n\nBut last week, the agency refused to do the review at all, according to the letter. It was signed by Dr. Vinay Prasad, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which oversees vaccine regulation.\n\nPrasad was an outspoken critic of the government’s response to Covid-19 before he was appointed to the FDA under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He claimed late last year without providing details that Covid-19 vaccines resulted in deaths of 10 children and has said the agency will change its vaccine approval process.\n\nModerna is one of three manufacturers in the US of approved Covid-19 vaccines, along with Pfizer and Novavax. Moderna and Pfizer’s vaccines use mRNA technology. Pfizer also has mRNA-based flu vaccines in development.\n\nAlthough the record-speed development of mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccines during the pandemic was a chief accomplishment of Trump’s first term, his second administration has withdrawn support for mRNA technology in infectious diseases. HHS canceled 22 projects worth about $500 million focused on mRNA vaccine development in August, claiming against evidence that “these vaccines fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu.”\n\nCovid-19 vaccines are estimated to have saved millions of lives. The hope behind applying mRNA technology to seasonal flu vaccines is that it could improve how well they work, enable tailoring for geographic regions where different strains are circulating and lead to combinations with Covid-19 vaccines so people would need only one shot for protection against both viruses.\n\nWith currently approved technology, experts select flu strains for each fall’s seasonal vaccines during the preceding February. Hoge pointed out that mRNA vaccines can be manufactured much faster; for Covid-19 vaccines, he said, the design is decided in May or June, for shipping by August.\n\nChoosing the strains closer to the start of flu season could potentially lead to a better match with circulating viruses, “and better matching equals, usually, better protection,” Hoge said.\n\nModerna’s phase 3 study showed in results reported in June that the mRNA-based flu shot produced efficacy that was about 27% higher than Fluarix in adults 50 and older. A separate trial that assessed safety and immune response included the comparison with a high-dose flu vaccine for people 65 and older and showed superiority, Moderna said.\n\nImmune response is assessed in the laboratory by analyzing blood samples of people who’ve been vaccinated, while efficacy assessments typically involve seeing how well a vaccine protects against cases of the disease.\n\nModerna had been awaiting the start of the review of its flu shot before it moved its experimental combination flu and Covid-19 mRNA vaccine into the FDA review process, Hoge said. That’s now on hold as the company awaits a meeting and further guidance from the agency.\n\nMeanwhile, the combination vaccine is moving forward in other countries.\n\n“We do expect that our first approval will be … probably in Europe, and this year,” Hoge said. “So that’ll be a milestone event.”",

    "description": "Daniel Fayemi, a software engineer, moved from Nigeria to Canada in 2024. He loves the weather and the food options but misses a tip-free culture.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Daniel Fayemi, a 28-year-old senior software and blockchain engineer living in Toronto. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nOver the past seven years, I've worked for multiple companies shipping blockchain integrations and production-grade financial infrastructure in Lagos, Amsterdam, and now Toronto.\n\nI started my career in Nigeria, where I was born and raised, and moved to Amsterdam in May 2023 after a short career break for a job as a senior software engineer. I returned to Nigeria after a year and worked until I received my Canadian work visa through my wife in October 2024.\n\nSince May 2025, I've worked as a senior software engineer at Source Inc. in Toronto, and I do some consulting on the side. I make a six-figure salary, plus restricted options in the same range.\n\nI really like living in Canada.\n\nMy then-girlfriend, now wife, was in school in Toronto, and I decided to join her. Professionally, I was also excited to work in the North American market and build products for a global audience from here.\n\nI was excited about moving, but mostly I was nervous. The costs add up fast … legal fees, travel, and finding a home in Toronto where my wife and I could settle. We put a lot of our savings on the line, and I was scared of not making something meaningful out of that money, effort, and sacrifice.\n\n\"Expensive\" is relative, but it's not just the price in Toronto; it's the space. You pay a lot for not much.\n\nFood can be expensive here, too. I saved \n\nTips, too, were a real money culture shock. In Lagos and Amsterdam, tipping is fully voluntary and even a little frowned upon. Here, they say it's optional, but the prompts are right there, leaving you with little choice. I get why it exists, but it took getting used to.\n\nCompared to Nigerian groceries, Amsterdam was actually more expensive than Toronto and harder to find, so I understand those prices. The funniest adjustment for me was actually grocery shopping.\n\nI landed last year, thinking I would do a classic Nigerian bulk run so I wouldn't have to keep going out in the cold. I pushed three heavy grocery bags through the lobby and the concierge, two neighbors in the elevator, and a guy in my hallway all asked if we were throwing a party. I learned fast.\n\nMy first culture shocks in Canada were the weather and the work culture. I'm usually fast-paced at work, and I've had to tone it down a bit. Also, as someone from Lagos who thought Amsterdam cold was \"real,\" Toronto taught me otherwise. I love the cold, or maybe I'm just not scared of it now.\n\nIn Toronto, if it's pouring or a heat alert is in effect, our team quietly switches to working from home. No drama, just \"see you on Slack.\" In the Netherlands, we still went in unless the weather was truly extreme. In Nigeria, you went in, period.\n\nThe second shock was leadership. My managers are genuinely kind and low-ego. There's no visible \"upper floor.\" People jump into the same document and solve the problem. Coming from what I joke is the \"Respect Capital of the World,\" Lagos, that felt radical at first.\n\nI like the occasional chit-chat with folks just starting out. Because most of my close friends here are software engineers at different levels, I don't feel a strong need for what the broader tech community has to offer. I still run a small mentorship back in Nigeria, and I think I need to focus on getting my feet under me here first.\n\nCompared with Lagos and parts of Europe, Canada feels more workplace-centered, so in Toronto, I rely on LinkedIn, Slack, and Discord for news and new opportunities. I found my current role on LinkedIn, and I still get about two recruiter messages a week there.\n\nThe groups I'm in are private circles of friends and friends-of-friends where we swap opportunities, do interview prep, workshop startup ideas, and sometimes just hop on to play video games. Sometimes I go on outings with colleagues and friends. We went to an arcade together recently.\n\nOur move has had some challenges. Finding a suitable place in Toronto has been one of the hardest parts of moving here. I recently left the first place I rented when I arrived, and it still took me four months to find a new one, even with all my documents.\n\nIt was a joint application with my wife, who has a good credit score. Because my credit score was still new, landlords kept requesting bank statements for my savings account, and a few also questioned my income. I think we only got this apartment because our real estate agent knew the landlady.\n\nI haven't had a single bad experience here. Toronto has a wide range of food, which I also appreciate. I can get authentic Lebanese shawarma at Shelby's Shawarma one night and the best pasta at Trattoria Mercatto the next, and yes, I've tried the whole menu.\n\nEvery day feels different, and the weather can change multiple times before lunch. I love that on a random Monday at 9 a.m., you might see a long line of people waiting to try a new ice cream brand. Toronto's interesting to watch, and I love it.\n\nI plan to grow into more leadership roles here, work more with AI, and maybe one day build something of my own, most likely something related to blockchain and AI.",

    "title": "I flew Europe's best airline for business class and food. The seat wasn't fully private but I liked the 'flying chef.'",
    "description": "You don't usually expect restaurant-style service at 35,000 feet — but Turkish still staffs a 'flying chef' in business class on its longest routes.",
    "fullText": "You don't usually expect restaurant-style service at 35,000 feet — but Turkish Airlines still staffs a 'flying chef' in business class on its longest routes.\n\nThese rare culinary specialists, who are separate from flight attendants, take food orders, plate meals in the galley, and oversee premium service on long-haul flights.\n\nThe role is designed to make dining feel closer to a restaurant than standard airline catering — but chefs don't actually cook from scratch due to flight safety rules. They use ovens to heat and finish pre-prepared meals and then arrange the presentation.\n\nThese chefs also take customer feedback from the air to help improve and develop meals in catering kitchens on the ground.\n\nI recently experienced the unique service on a 10-hour flight from Istanbul to New York in January. Considering Turkish won Skytrax's 2025 awards for Europe's best business class and best business class catering, I was eager to see how the seat and food measured up.\n\nI strategically chose the Boeing 787 for its modern business cabin; the Boeing 777 that also flies the route doesn't have the nicer design.\n\nBetween the lie-flat seat, the large TV, and the restaurant-style meals, the cabin felt like my living room on a lazy Saturday night.\n\nI slept well and appreciated the wide variety of food, from poached eggs and swordfish to a trolley full of savory appetizers.\n\nHere's what the full experience was like. Business Insider paid a media rate for the business class upgrade to New York.\n\nTurkish's Istanbul business class lounge is unreal, with cooked-to-order meals like omelettes and kebabs, drink stations, and sleep suites that feel like mini hotel rooms.\n\nMy layover time qualified me for a suite, but they're first-come, first-served — I was lucky to wait only about 15 minutes.\n\nThe bed was so comfortable I slept five hours straight, with a shared bathroom and shower just across the hall.\n\nI chose seat 8A, in the last row, for privacy and to be among the first to deplane. Although it's right by the galley and lavatory nearest the boarding door, I didn't notice much noise with headphones on.\n\nMost Turkish business cabins don't have doors. Some A350s do, and the airline is planning a new \"Crystal Business Class\" with sliding doors, but most planes — including the 787 I flew on — still don't.\n\nIt's not a dealbreaker by any means, and the seat wings help cocoon the space a bit, but there is less overall privacy than with a door.\n\nThe business class seats lie fully flat, and mine felt both spacious and cozy. I could comfortably sleep on my stomach, and I particularly liked the mattress pad and the dual-texture blanket, which has a soft plush on one side.\n\nI also appreciated the 1-2-1 cabin that let me freely reach the aisle. Many of Turkish's old planes still have 2-3-2 layouts that force middle and window-seat travelers to crawl over their neighbor to reach the restroom.\n\nThe seat had multiple storage spots: a cabinet, a footrest cubby, and a slim seatback pocket — plus an overhead bin to myself.\n\nI stashed my purse, Kindle, chargers, boots, backpack, and jacket without feeling cramped.\n\nThe seat's television was large and fully controllable via a handheld remote. I watched \"The Big Bang Theory,\" \"Fast and Furious,\" and an Agatha Christie-style whodunit called \"Murder at the Embassy.\"\n\nInstead of a flight attendant, a dedicated flying chef takes orders, plates meals, and preps appetizer and dessert carts.\n\nMost of the menu — like meats and soups — are fully or nearly fully cooked on the ground in airline kitchens, but finished in the air by the chef and cabin crew using onboard ovens.\n\nThe cabin crew still hands out drinks and hot towels, but with meals covered, I imagine they can better focus on other tasks.\n\nAll of the food was served on real dishware and with flatware — no cheap plastic.\n\nTurkish offers a \"dining-on-demand\" strategy that lets passengers choose when they want to eat.\n\nFor example, I slept a few hours after breakfast before requesting tea, though the crew member also brought me a small sandwich. It was simple — handcrafted with a roll, lettuce, and cheese — but perfect while I watched a movie.\n\nThere were also free snacks available throughout the flight, like popcorn, fruit, mixed nuts, chocolate, cookies, and chips.\n\nThe breakfast started with appetizers: fresh juice, fruit salad, cheeses, smoked turkey, marinated olives, and bread with butter and jam.\n\nThe entrée options included poached eggs with a savory sauce called shakshuka, spinach-and-cheese stuffed pastries and flatbreads (börek and gözleme), and sweet curd crepes with fruit and berry sauce.\n\nI had the poached eggs, which were prepared on the ground but were still fluffy with a perfectly runny yolk on the plane.\n\nThe second meal included a huge range of appetizers: octopus salad, salmon tartare, shrimp salad, artichoke salad, fried aubergine, beef patties, chicken salad, cheese, red pepper soup, creamy pea soup, and Köpoğlu (essentially Turkish eggplant caviar).\n\nEverything was arranged on a trolley by the chef and rolled down the galley for passengers to pick and choose; the presentation made the experience feel more fancy, and everything was tasty.\n\nBesides Turkish, select Saudia, Austrian Airlines, and Garuda Indonesia flights feature onboard chefs.\n\nTurkish's chefs, staffed through catering partner DO&CO, also spend time at meal-prep facilities, providing feedback and helping maintain quality — a hands-on approach that shows in the in-flight service.\n\nI rarely check luggage, but I had too many souvenirs this time.\n\nLuckily, my bag survived the transfer from Zagreb, Croatia, and arrived in New York safe and sound.",

    "description": "I made Buffalo chicken dip using recipes from three celebrity chefs. The best version uses five ingredients, including Costco rotisserie chicken.",
    "fullText": "There's nothing better than making a warm, creamy Buffalo chicken dip when I'm hosting guests.\n\nSo, I tried recipes from celebrity chefs Trisha Yearwood, Pat Neely, and Claire Robinson to see which famous figure had the tastiest dip.\n\nHere's how each one stacked up.\n\nYearwood's recipe called for more fresh ingredients than the others, which I appreciated.\n\nHowever, this also meant the recipe was more labor-intensive, as it required dicing a whole onion and simmering chicken breasts in hot sauce for about an hour.\n\nIt also called for vegetable oil, garlic, hot sauce, sour cream, olive-oil mayonnaise, shredded cheddar cheese, green onions, and blue-cheese crumbles.\n\nYearwood also suggested cutting up celery and carrots to dip into the finished dish.\n\nPer Yearwood's instructions, I cooked the onions in a pan and added the thinly sliced chicken breasts, garlic, a cup of water, and half a cup of hot sauce.\n\nI simmered the chicken in hot sauce for about an hour, but after trying a piece, I didn't think this gave the meat that much flavor. All the work seemed a little redundant when the recipe called for adding more hot sauce to the mayo mixture anyway.\n\nOnce the chicken had simmered, I combined this mixture with the sour cream, mayo, cheddar, and a quarter cup of blue cheese.\n\nI thought the directions took an odd turn when they said to serve the dip \"with the chicken\" in step four. I followed the comments-section consensus and mixed the chicken into the dip before topping it with the remaining blue cheese and green onions.\n\nThe mix of freshly cooked chicken and cold ingredients created a room-temperature dip.\n\nThe familiar flavor combo of Frank's RedHot sauce and blue cheese was present, but the dip wasn't spicy. I could see it working in a Buffalo-chicken-salad sandwich if it were a little less chunky.\n\nGiven all the demands of hosting a party, I think spending more than an hour on a dip that's supposed to be served immediately — but isn't even hot — would be inefficient.\n\nNeely's recipe was the simplest of the three, relying mostly on dried seasonings and canned chicken breast.\n\nThe recipe called for cream cheese, sour cream, dried parsley, Cajun seasoning, onion powder, hot sauce, canned chicken, and shredded cheddar cheese.\n\nNeely's recipe also notes that the dip can be made ahead of time and stashed in the fridge, which seemed pretty convenient.\n\nI started by adding the cream cheese, sour cream, hot sauce, and seasonings to my mixer. I used a stand mixer because Neely used one, though you could probably make the dip without this equipment.\n\nWhen I was done mixing, I was hit with the unmistakable smell of onion dip, which was surprising.\n\nNevertheless, I continued to fold in the chicken and shredded cheese and spooned the mixture into casserole dishes. I sprinkled the rest of the cheese on top and baked the dip in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes.\n\nFlavor-wise, this dip was the boldest of the three, but it strayed from the familiar Buffalo-wing taste I'm used to. The Cajun seasoning and hot sauce also made this the spiciest dip by a wide margin.\n\nIt was intense enough to risk numbing my guests' mouths before the main course, so I'd go lighter on the seasoning next time.\n\nNeely's dip was also the loosest and least chicken-heavy of the three recipes, so it seemed like it would be best served alongside heartier dishes.\n\nRobinson's recipe called for the fewest ingredients of the three, requiring only a rotisserie chicken (which I purchased from Costco), cream cheese, crumbled blue cheese, chopped celery, and hot sauce.\n\nPreparing the chicken for this recipe was hardly the neatest. Outside the greasy process of pulling apart the chicken, though, it was a very straightforward recipe.\n\nLike Neely's, the recipe said the dip could be prepared ahead of time.\n\nRobinson's recipe called for softening the cream cheese on the stove over medium heat, but the cold block scalded at that temperature. I lowered the temperature so it could slowly melt, and from there, the process was easy.\n\nI mixed in the chicken pieces, chopped celery, and hot sauce, transferred the dip to a casserole dish, covered it with crumbled blue cheese, and baked it at 425 degrees for 25 minutes.\n\nThe recipe made enough to fill a 9-inch pie pan, but I separated mine into smaller portions.\n\nRobinson's chicken-heavy recipe was true to the classic flavor of Buffalo dip, with just enough spice to keep everyone happy.\n\nThe chopped celery, which I figured would get lost, provided a surprising amount of texture and a bit of color, and the moist, dark-chicken meat didn't dry out while baking.\n\nThis dip was so meaty that I think it could be served as an alternative to chicken wings.\n\nRobinson's was the clear winner among the three dips. Though I could see myself dipping a crusty piece of bread into it, it was also hearty enough that it felt like a main dish.\n\nPlus, there's something very football-friendly about being able to advertise a whole-chicken Buffalo dip to your guests.\n\nClick to check out the other celebrity-chef recipes we've put head-to-head so far.\n\nThis story was originally published on February 7, 2024, and most recently updated on February 6, 2026.",

By the end of my visit, I couldn't believe how much I'd fallen for the Canadian city.\n\nFor the first time, I found myself pulling up rental prices and researching how long I could legally stay in a place before I'd even left.\n\nSomehow, Montreal felt like it was meant for me.\n\nWhen it gets dark, the energy here feels palpable — and I found locals can really party in style. Even as a solo female traveler, I felt at home chatting up bartenders, patrons, and night owls on trains back to my Airbnb.\n\nThe two-in-one delight that is Pub Saint Pierre and Barrelmans Bar in Old Town was my first stop. The handcrafted cocktails and simply wondrous tapas menu were hits. I still think about the potato mille-feuille with garlic butter and goat cheese I ordered — if you see it on the menu, you must try it.\n\nAtwater Cocktail Club, which has been regularly featured in Canada's top 10 bars for years, was astounding. The cleverly constructed drinks and refined French-inspired small plates and comfort dishes left me feeling impressed.\n\nAnd, of course, there's plenty of fun to be had at wine bars in the area.\n\nMy two favorites are Rouge Gorge, where I've experienced incredible service and spot-on recommendations, and Casavant, which has incredibly romantic date-night vibes.\n\nMontreal might not be the first place people name when they list global food capitals, but it should be.\n\nSure, you've got the Canadian classics like poutine: crispy fries smothered in rich gravy and topped with melty cheese curds that squeak with every bite.\n\nAnd then there are the iconic Montreal-style bagels from Fairmount and St-Viateur; slightly sweeter, with a perfect chewable crust.\n\nBut beyond the staples that make Canadian food stellar, Montreal is quietly crushing it on its international cuisine. For one, I'm still thinking about the flavorful, incredible Venezuelan arepas I had from Arepera.\n\nOf course, no visit to the city is complete without a stop at Jean-Talon Market, which is open year-round. Here you'll find local honey and maple syrup to bring home, amazing seafood stalls, and fresh veggies and fruits that burst with color and flavor.\n\nIt felt easy to picture myself eating my way around the city for weeks without ever getting bored.\n\nI loved how easy it was for me to get around Montreal.\n\nBeyond being fairly walkable with many smooth sidewalks, the local public-transit system truly shines.\n\nWhether I was taking the bus or the metro, stations I stopped at felt clean with well-labeled signs and maps. I never once got lost while navigating the city.\n\nComing from Los Angeles, where public transit feels like a work in progress, this felt like a breath of fresh air. Plus, not having to drive or sit in traffic is the dream.\n\nThough I'm sure living in Montreal has its drawbacks, the pros seem quite compelling: incredible food, rich culture, and strong public infrastructure, to name a few.\n\nPlus, Canada as a whole has some appealing perks, like unviersal healthcare, a more relaxed pace, and a pretty welcoming attitude … even if it gets a little chillier than I'm used to.\n\nMontreal just feels livable. There always seems to be something to do in the city — outdoor exhibits, a massive yearly summer Fringe Festival, winter carnivals, and so much more.\n\nTo me, it doesn't just feel like a place you just pass through; it feels like one where you can build a life.\n\nBut there's a catch. Recently, Canada tightened some of its visa options, especially for digital nomads and self-employed individuals. With many of those programs suspended, getting long-term access without an in-demand skill set is tough.\n\nAs a freelance journalist and content creator, that's a frustrating barrier, especially for a city that feels so inclusive. Still, I'm not giving up on the idea. Whether it's short-term stints or long weekends, I already know I'll be back.\n\nMontreal has officially joined the short list of places that feel like they could be home, even if, for now, just in spirit.",

    "description": "The Olympic Village in Milan offers plenty of perks and amenities for athletes, including free food, stress plants and beds that are not made of cardboard.",
    "fullText": "The Olympic Village rises above the security fences that surround it, a collection of structures both temporary and permanent where the athletes will reside over the next two-plus weeks at the Milan-Cortina Games.\n\nOut on the sidewalk and behind barriers, lookie-loos crane their necks for a peek at the competitors, while pin traders mill through the churning crowd in hopes of making a souvenir swap.\n\nBut what’s it like inside the Village, where the medal hopefuls work out, mingle and relax before some of the biggest moments of their young lives?\n\n“The best part is the food,” said Micah Moore, bobsledder from Trinidad and Tobago, echoing what people have said for centuries about Italy. “Nutrition is so important. And everything you see is free.”\n\nAh, yes, gratis. That’s a common theme in the Olympic Village, where corporate sponsors of the Games have gotten creative with their free goods and services — and swag bags — for the athletes.\n\nThere are multiple rooms devoted to gaming, with virtual-reality glasses over here, and “Call of Duty” over there, and overstuffed chairs and couches everywhere. There are the typical role-playing video games, along with virtual tennis and dirtbike riding, but conspicuously absent are any winter sports. Organizers explain the rooms are meant to be an escape from that all-encompassing world.\n\nSpeaking of escapes, Corona Cero — the non-alcoholic version of that beer — has constructed a pair of round, glass-roofed wooden structures that feel like part-ski lodge, part-yurt and are filled with plants and comfortable seats and soft music where the athletes can kick back with a chilled beverage. (It has been mild weather for a Milan winter.)\n\nThere are rolled-up yoga mats in the corner, and a chalkboard outside lists times for a breathwork class with Sarah, a soundbath session with Guilia, and restorative yoga and meditation in the afternoon.\n\nNot far away, and made of similar wood, is a wagon labeled the Cero (“zero”) Stress Plant Shop. There, an athlete can adopt a houseplant for the duration of his or her stay, nurturing it for a couple weeks before it’s donated to a local charity, perhaps for auction. The competitor is given a pack of seeds upon departure to grow the same plant at home.\n\nFour-time Olympian Madison Chock said she was “pleasantly surprised” the competitors could foster plants. She said the plant that she shares with husband/ice dance partner Evan Bates is named “Stenry,” a combination of their dogs’ names, Stella and Henry. She said the plant is thriving, although she doesn’t know the variety, only that it’s dangly and has leaves that cascade down like a waterfall.\n\nOf course, sitting around and watching plants grow can get a little dull. This week, the arriving athletes seemed more interested in getting accustomed to their free Samsung phones and using their own hand gestures to direct a robotic hand behind glass to pick up a plastic ball encasing a mystery Olympic pin. The AI demonstration by Alibaba Cloud is a futuristic version of those arcade games where you maneuver a metal claw to grab a stuffed animal.\n\nThe Olympics is filled with young, beautiful athletes, so it’s no wonder two of the more popular pop-ups in the Village provide skin and haircare products and services. KIKO Milano has cosmetic stations where athletes can schedule makeup appointments — very popular before the Opening Ceremonies — and Procter & Gamble has built a “Champions Clubhouse” for scalp massages, hair washing and styling, along with barbers for personalized shaving and beard care.\n\nThere are P&G swag bags of course — some athletes arrived without any toiletries — and KIKO engraves complimentary tubes of lipstick with the names of competitors.\n\nCoca-Cola takes that engraving process a step further with a machine that snaps a photo of the user, then embosses that picture onto the iconic red can of soda.\n\nBeyond the keepsakes, the Olympic organizers have gotten an essential right in the Village. Gone are the flimsy cardboard bedframes of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, held during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThere was speculation at the time that those beds were designed to discourage casual sex among the competitors because the frames would break apart at the slightest provocation. Organizers brushed off those rumors, heralding the beds as sturdy and eco-friendly.\n\nRegardless, when she arrived at this year’s Olympic Village, Britain figure skater Phebe Bekker posted a Tik-Tok video from her room that answered a popular question among the athletes, many of whom found the cardboard beds uncomfortable.\n\n“We’re looking good,” she said, knocking on her wooden bedframe and testing the mattress. “Heard it here first, there are no cardboard beds, as far as I know.”\n\nJust like the slogan of that popular soft drink. It’s the real thing.\n\nStaff writer Thuc Nhi Nguyen contributed to this report.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Super Bowl recipes like creamy queso, Buffalo chicken wings, meatballs, and mac and cheese can all be made in a slow cooker.",
    "fullText": "In a bid to find simple Super Bowl party foods that didn't require hours in the kitchen, I decided to test out five slow-cooker recipes.\n\nI've made classics like Buffalo chicken dip countless times in my Crock-Pot, but this time I branched out with options like spicy wings, meatballs, and mac and cheese.\n\nEvery dish impressed me, though the wings were the clear MVP.\n\nHere's how I made the game-day appetizers in a slow cooker.\n\nThese meatballs by Chef Savvy are super versatile: You can serve them on their own with tomato sauce, in a roll for a delicious meatball sub, or with pasta. The ingredients for the meatballs are pretty standard — I used a meatball mix from the grocery store that included beef and pork.\n\nIt's best to mix the ingredients by hand in the bowl to ensure the eggs, breadcrumbs, and meat are well incorporated.\n\nI could see the chopped onion and parsley peeking through the meat mixture. The recipe that I followed said you should have about 24 meatballs — I had that exact number, so I was confident that my meatballs were the right size.\n\nNext, I broiled the meatballs in the oven for about four minutes on each side, careful not to burn them.\n\nI then started gathering the ingredients for the tomato sauce: crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, bay leaves, red pepper flakes, and Italian seasoning.\n\nIt's OK if the meatballs are placed on top of each other if your slow cooker is slightly smaller.\n\nAfter adding my tomato sauce ingredients, I set the slow cooker on low for four hours, as per the recipe. However, when I pulled out my first meatball at the four-hour mark, I thought it looked a little underdone. It's important to check your meatballs before eating them, as there can be variations in the cooking time depending on the size of your meatballs or even your slow cooker.\n\nI let mine continue cooking for another half-hour on high to make sure everything was done for dinner time.\n\nI thought the meatballs were perfectly juicy and well-seasoned, while the tomato sauce tasted like homemade marinara that had been cooking on the stove for hours.\n\nI enjoyed the meatballs on their own as an appetizer. However, later in the week, I served some of the leftover meatballs and sauce with pasta for dinner, which really impressed me as well.\n\nI started by mixing together Buffalo sauce, minced garlic, chopped yellow onion, and brown sugar.\n\nWhile I had heard you could make Buffalo wings in a slow cooker, I was admittedly skeptical. I was nervous that the wings wouldn't turn out crispy enough, since that's usually done in a traditional oven or a fryer.\n\nHowever, Spend With Pennies' recipe called for broiling the wings after cooking them in the slow cooker, which would crisp them in just a few minutes.\n\nThe chicken wings that I bought didn't have the drumsticks and flats separated, which added a bit of time to my preparation.\n\nAfter they were fully cooked, I removed them from the slow cooker and placed them on a sheet pan with foil.\n\nI then brushed some of the Buffalo sauce still in the slow cooker over the wings. I then put them under the broiler for about three minutes on each side until they were crispy and slightly blackened.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by how easy these wings were to make, and loved how the slow cooker made the wings extremely tender.\n\nThe wings were crispy on the outside, while the meat inside was tender, juicy, and moist. I also thought they were the perfect spice level — they had a kick but didn't set my mouth on fire.\n\nI thought these would fit in well at any game-day or Super Bowl party.\n\nI've tried a number of Martha Stewart's slow-cooker recipes in the past, and I've enjoyed a majority of them. I was excited to see how Stewart's queso dip recipe would turn out.\n\nLike a lot of her slow-cooker recipes, this dip only required a few ingredients, which I really appreciated when it came to braving the grocery store a week before Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nI started by adding American cheese and pepper jack cheese to the slow cooker and mixed it with a small amount of cornstarch.\n\nI mixed it until it was creamy and then seasoned it with salt.\n\nYou'll know it's done when the dip is bubbling and slightly thickened.\n\nI added sliced jalapeños, red onion, and cilantro.\n\nI thought the pepper jack and American cheeses meshed well together, while the tomatoes and green chilies added a lot of flavor. I really liked the texture of the dip — it wasn't too thick or too watery.\n\nI also really liked how this dip only called for a few ingredients. It would definitely make life a lot easier when cooking for a group of people on Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nThe celebrity chef shared her recipe for slow-cooker macaroni and cheese in her cookbook, \"Martha Stewart's Slow Cooker.\"\n\nThe recipe calls for three cups of white sharp cheddar cheese and one cup of Gruyere, which creates the sauce. The third and final cheese in this recipe, Parmigiano Reggiano, is added to the breadcrumb mixture later.\n\nI softened the chopped onion with a tablespoon of butter.\n\nAfter mixing the ingredients with the uncooked macaroni, simply leave the slow cooker to cook on high.\n\nTo make the breadcrumbs, the recipe instructed me to pulse two slices of bread in a food processor. I then toasted the breadcrumb pieces on the stove for a few minutes until they were golden brown.\n\nI thought that the three different kinds of cheese, especially the smoked Gruyere, made for a complex flavor profile, while the onions added a savory flavor to the dish.\n\nThe base for the Buffalo chicken dip by Taste of Home calls for crumbled blue cheese, cream cheese, sour cream, and ranch dressing.\n\nI mixed those ingredients in a medium-sized bowl before spreading the dip in a single layer in the bottom of my slow cooker.\n\nYou can use rotisserie chicken or simply boil up some chicken breasts and shred them yourself with a fork, like I did.\n\nI could already tell this dip was going to be delicious.\n\nI set the slow cooker to warm and began prepping my toppings. I added another layer of American cheese and put the lid on the slow cooker to allow the cheese to melt. Then, I chopped up one green onion and added it to the top.\n\nThe layers of the dip were perfectly proportioned. With each bite, I got a delicious mouthful of cheese, hot sauce, and chicken. This recipe really impressed me, and I would definitely make it again.",

    "fullText": "What stemmed from a 10-day trip to Hong Kong in 2009 to visit my then-boyfriend blossomed into a love story with Asia.\n\nOn my first foray into the East, I landed bright-eyed, eager, and entirely clueless. My welcome meal — a dim sum feast — was a revelation. With my now-husband and 10 of his newest friends, we encircled a table piled with dozens of steamer baskets filled with dimpled sweet buns, flaky taro puffs, braised meats, crispy-bottomed dumplings, and more.\n\nIgnoring my lack of chopsticks experience, I dove in, unsteadily maneuvering a still-steaming bun toward my plate. My finger slipped. And the pastry, in all its custard-filled rotundness, plopped into my teacup, forming a geyser of hot liquid that sprayed those around me.\n\nMortified, I vowed to use chopsticks at every meal until I mastered them. Seventeen years in, it has shaped my sense of self and defined my career as a food journalist.\n\nTraversing epicurean-fueled travels, here are three gastronomic destinations I recommend to fellow travelers, and one I don't, despite the fanfare surrounding it.\n\nFrom bustling street stalls to iconic hole-in-the-wall gems, Thailand's culinary landscape has pulled me in a dozen times over.\n\nBeyond the conventional pad thai and mango sticky rice, there's a deep-rooted legacy of punchy flavors, best washed down with a frothy glass of silky-sweet Thai milk tea.\n\nOne of my most memorable encounters happened by chance, when I ducked into a small storefront to escape a sudden downpour. Distracted by the rain, I almost missed the bubbling stockpot, until the sight of Lung Cheay's signature egg noodles snapped me back to attention. Beloved by those in the know for its dry tom yum, topped with succulent barbecued pork and soft-boiled eggs, the shop is a classic Thai rags-to-riches story. The line that now snakes down the block is worlds away from its humble beginnings as a pushcart.\n\nOther bites I never miss during a visit to Bangkok span melt-in-your-mouth, marinated seafood smothered in a sour and spicy herb sauce at Pa Nee Kung Chae Nam Pla, fried chicken liberally caked in crisped garlic cloves at Polo Fried Chicken, and late-night pilgrimages to Talad Noi Crab Fried Rice overflowing with carb god devotees praying away tomorrow's impending hangover.\n\nI first visited Ho Chi Minh City, or Saigon, in 2017 and returned three more times that year alone. The city reflects historical influences from China, Cambodia, France, and the US, culminating in a distinctly southern-style Vietnamese cuisine that bridges bold flavors, ferments, and fresh herbs.\n\nStreet food forms the backbone of Saigon, with carts feeding the ebb and flow of passersby like blood pumping to the beat of the city's pulsating heart. As evening marches into night, city corners transform into impromptu eateries, with portable tables, plastic stools, and motorbikes abound.\n\nI've done my fair share of devouring in this street-food mecca. There's Bún Thịt Nướng — Nguyễn Trung Trực, a no-frills, 30-year-old stall known for heaping bowls of vermicelli topped with grilled pork, crisp egg rolls, pickles, and a bouquet of herbs.\n\nThen there's Bún Cá Xe Dẩy, a late-night vendor ladling steaming bowls of canh chua — a tangy pineapple, tamarind, and tomato soup laced with fried fish. And at Xíu Mại chén Đèn Dầu, springy Vietnamese-style meatballs are served in a fragrant broth, with a crusty baguette on the side for dipping.\n\nRegardless of how many times I visit, there's always another miniature plastic chair flanking a buzzing back-alley pop-up waiting for me to take a seat.\n\nMost famous for turning the spice dial up to an 11 through Sichuan peppercorn flakes that vibrate against your lips long after the meal concludes and seemingly innocuous bites that still register on the Scoville scale, eating in Chengdu is an all-out heat offensive.\n\nIt's also my go-to for Chinese culinary travel.\n\nWhile wontons are ubiquitous within China, only in Chengdu will you find hongyou chaoshou (red oil wontons). Coated in chile oil, these crescent-shaped pockets of joy are omnipresent, each spot tweaking the recipe ever-so-slightly to cause a ripple in the die-hard fandom of one wonton shop over the next.\n\nWarming bowls of wontons sprinkled with friendly shopkeeper chitchat earmark my annual pilgrimages to China's spice capital.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, tianshuimian (sweet water noodles) spotlight Sichuan's signature guaiwei, or \"strange flavor\" — a seasoning that folds spicy, salty, sesame, sour, and sweet into a single bite. Cord-like, al dente noodles are swaddled in dark and light soy sauce, chile oil, sesame and garlic pastes, crushed peanuts, Sichuan peppercorns, and brown sugar syrup, forming a gravy that varnishes each strand with an addictive, lip-tingling heat.\n\nSitting with a brimming bowlful of bland noodles in Tokyo, I've been left with frustration rather than fulfillment more times than I care to recount. Japan, as a whole, struggles with excess hype and over-tourism resulting from a fetishization of its culture.\n\nIt's in vogue to collect kawaii memorabilia, swap coffee for matcha, and recount every Miyazaki movie ever made. I even have an anime bowl of ramen tattooed on my arm. (Zero regrets)\n\nTokyo is the epicenter of that trendiness.\n\nOften miscast as the pinnacle of Japanese cuisine, Tokyo tempts visitors, myself included, into chasing viral ramen shops, jiggly pancake cafés, and so-called must-visit markets — places popularized by social media, complete with long waits and inflated prices that rarely justify the hype.\n\nWhile this dynamic exists in many international cities, I find it far more blatant in Tokyo.\n\nThis is in no way a dig at Japanese food; it's one of my favorite cuisines. From thick fillets of bonito seared over dried straw flames in Kochi Prefecture to bubbling streetside vats of oden in Osaka —daikon, tofu, and fish cakes simmered in an aromatic broth — my travels across Japan have almost always left me deeply satisfied.\n\nBut in Tokyo, specifically, I often struggle as an outsider to distinguish between what's genuinely great and what's merely hyped.\n\nStill, with Tokyo as my neighbor, there's always room for a new chapter in my Asian food love saga.",

    "fullText": "Selling Chicago-style pizza outside of Chicago has always been a challenge.\n\nAs someone who grew up near Boston, a city with a grand tradition of thinner-crust pizza offered by chains such as Pizzeria Regina, Papa Gino's, and Santarpio's, deep-dish pizza seemed like an entirely different food. It wasn't something commonly sold during my childhood, and it remains something I've never really considered pizza.\n\nDespite that, Uno Pizzeria, which was known as Pizzeria Uno back in the 1980s and 90s, flourished in New England. The chain offered a version of deep-dish pizza that was a take on the Chicago classic, but also closer to traditional pizza.\n\nIt was deep-dish, but not quite as deep as what's traditionally sold under that name. You could eat it with a fork and knife, but you could also pick it up and eat it as a slice.\n\nUno did not exactly take over New England, but it became a steady presence with dozens of locations across the region. That presence has slowly withered, as the overall chain has shrunk from over 150 locations nationwide to only 36 as of Feb. 3, 2026, according to the locations page on the company's website.\n\nNow, the chain has suddenly closed three more Massachusetts locations.\n\nUno Pizzeria has closed locations in Dedham, Revere, and Braintree, Massachusetts, without any notification to customers, Boston's WCVB reported.\n\nThe chain posted a notice on its Facebook page, which has since been taken down.\n\n“After 34 years of serving this amazing community, our Revere location is closing its doors for the last time on Sunday,” the restaurant posted. “We would like to extend a massive thank you to everyone who has made this restaurant feel like home for over three decades. It’s been an unforgettable run!”\n\nTaco Bell and KFC work on simplifying their restaurants\n\nChick-fil-A making major change to 425 restaurants nationwide\n\nBankrupt beer and pizza restaurant chain closes locations\n\nRestaurant chain famed for rude waiters closes multiple locations\n\nThese shutdowns leave only five Massachusetts locations listed on the chain’s website. Two locations are listed for New Hampshire, in Concord and Tilton. No Uno restaurants remain in Rhode Island.\n\nUno did not return a request for comment from the news station.\n\nDedham, Massachusetts: Uno Pizzeria & Grill location closed permanently on Jan. 11, after 37 years in business.\n\nRevere, Massachusetts: Longtime local restaurant shut its doors on Jan. 11, ending 34 years of service.\n\nBraintree, Massachusetts: Uno closed this 33-year-old location on Jan. 11.\n\nWarwick, Rhode Island: The last Uno Pizzeria & Grill in Rhode Island closed alongside the Massachusetts locations.\n\nSignificant reduction in total units: Uno has been shrinking over the past few years; it closed more than a quarter of its U.S. system in 2024, dropping from around 68 locations to about 53, and continued closures have pushed that count lower in 2025, reported Nation's Restaurant News (NRN).",

    "description": "Delivering food and other items could be key to making robotaxis work economically, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said on Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "Uber Eats might end up playing a key role in its parent company's robotaxi business, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said.\n\nThe ride-hailing app is working with multiple companies, such as Alphabet-backed Waymo, to make self-driving cars available through its app. Waymo's robotaxis have already proven more efficient than most human Uber drivers in cities such as Atlanta and Austin, Uber has said.\n\nOne big question hanging over robotaxis, though, is what happens to the vehicles during times of the day when demand for rides is low, Khosrowshahi said on Uber's fourth-quarter earnings call on Wednesday.\n\nHe pointed to one solution: Have them drive orders to customers through Uber's food delivery and freight businesses.\n\nSome delivery services, such as DoorDash, are also experimenting with robotaxis for food deliveries. Uber offers both ride-hailing and delivery, meaning robotaxis on its network could shift between the two as demand for each changes, Khosrowshahi said on Wednesday.\n\n\"Having delivery and freight as part of our logistics ecosystem gives us an opportunity to actually use these vehicles at a structurally higher utilization than anyone else,\" Khosrowshahi said.\n\nWhile ride-hailing accounted for over half of Uber's revenue in the fourth quarter, its delivery business grew by 29%, a faster clip than the 18% growth rate its ride-hailing segment posted in the same period.\n\nHow efficiently companies use the autonomous vehicles that they put on the streets is one of the challenges hanging over the technology.\n\nSafety is another. Last month, a Waymo car injured a child near a school in Santa Monica, California, the latest in a series of accidents involving self-driving cars. Waymo said it is cooperating with a federal probe into the accident.\n\nWhile it doesn't operate self-driving cars directly, Uber is experimenting with ways to train the AI behind robotaxis using data it collects from human drivers, Khosrowshahi said. Uber has a partnership with Nvidia to collect that data, for instance. Last month, Uber said it would launch AV Labs, an arm focused on similar training efforts.\n\nKhosrowshahi said the goal is to make self-driving cars more reliable and avoid situations such as last year's Waymo blackout in San Francisco, when a power outage prompted the company to suspend services. \"The real world can create unexpected circumstances,\" he said.\n\nRobotaxis also require infrastructure to store, charge, and repair. Some companies, such as startup Voltera, are building depots for those purposes in anticipation of a robotaxi boom in the coming years.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Frozen dessert fast-food chains are among the favorite shops that consumers enjoy visiting, but financial distress in some cases leads to bankruptcies and closings that disappoint customers.\n\nThe ice cream shop industry reported 0.9% growth in 2025, according to data from IBISWorld, but still faces economic issues.\n\n\"Despite the general increase in appetite for ice cream, significant challenges must be navigated,\" IBISWorld said in the report.\n\nAmong the economic challenges the report cited is the rising cost of milk, which cuts into profits.\n\nTariffs on Canadian dairy products have also increased the cost of milk and butter that are essential for ice cream production, which drives up retail prices and reduces profit margins, the report said.\n\nCustomers' most preferred shops include Baskin-Robbins, Ben & Jerry's, Cold Stone Creamery, Dairy Queen, and Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers.\n\nCertain chains ran into some economic problems in 2025 that forced them to file for bankruptcy or close locations.\n\nIce cream shop operators have stated a variety of reasons for closing down, including rising costs of labor and products driven by inflation or, more recently, tariffs; high lease payments; increased costs of debt from higher interest rates; and changing attitudes toward shopping by consumers.\n\nAbout 30 Dairy Queens in Texas lost their franchises in the first half of 2025 when the parent company, American Dairy Queen, pulled the franchises from franchisee Project Lonestar after it failed to remodel its locations. That meant that those locations could not order supplies from the parent corporation and would have to shut down.\n\nAnd now the parent company of the Cream ice cream shop chain has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy to reorganize and restructure its debts, which includes an employment law lawsuit judgment.\n\nCreamy Treats Inc. filed its petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California on Feb. 2, listing $500,000 to $1 million in assets and $100,000 to $500,000 in liabilities.\n\nThe San Francisco-based ice cream shop chain, which specializes in fresh ice cream sandwiches, did not list a specific reason for filing for bankruptcy protection, but among its largest unsecured creditors was Halil Budan, who is owed $98,000 for an employment law lawsuit. The debtor also listed Square Financial Services, owed $27,000.\n\n73-year-old family diner franchisee files Chapter 11 bankruptcy\n\nMore troubled regional airlines file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy\n\nMajor department store brand liquidates in Chapter 11 bankruptcy",

    "description": "UPFs are made to encourage addiction and consumption and should be regulated like tobacco, say researchers",
    "fullText": "UPFs are made to encourage addiction and consumption and should be regulated like tobacco, say researchers\n\nUltra-processed foods (UPFs) have \n\nUPFs and cigarettes are engineered to encourage addiction and consumption, researchers from three US universities said, pointing to the parallels in widespread health harms that link both.\n\nUPFs, which are widely available worldwide, are food products that have been industrially manufactured, often using emulsifiers or artificial colouring and flavours. The category includes soft drinks and packaged snacks such as crisps and biscuits.\n\nThere are similarities in the production processes of UPFs and cigarettes, and in manufacturers’ efforts to optimise the “doses” of products and how quickly they act on reward pathways in the body, according to the paper from researchers at Harvard, the University of Michigan and Duke University.\n\nThey draw on data from the fields of addiction science, nutrition and public health history to make their comparisons, published on 3 February in the healthcare journal the Milbank Quarterly.\n\nThe authors suggest that marketing claims on the products, such as being “low fat” or “sugar free”, are “health washing” that can stall regulation, akin to the advertising of cigarette filters in the 1950s as protective innovations that “in practice offered little meaningful benefit”.\n\nUltra-processed food involves extremely high levels of manufacturing to produce. It includes all formula milk, many commercially produced baby and toddler foods, fizzy drinks and sweets, fast food, snacks, biscuits and cakes, as well as mass-produced bread and breakfast cereals, ready meals and desserts.\n\nUltra-processed ingredients include fruit juice concentrates, maltodextrin, dextrose, golden syrup, hydrogenated oils, soya protein isolate, gluten, “mechanically separated meat”, organic dried egg whites, as well as rice and potato starch and corn fibre. Additives such as monosodium glutamate, colourings, thickeners and glazing agents are also ultra-processed.\n\nUltra-processed food contains higher levels of salt, sugar, fat and additives that are associated with obesity, cancer, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. They also tend to have lower levels of protein, zinc, magnesium, vitamins A, C, D, E, B12 and niacin necessary for a child’s optimal growth and development. It is also thought that other mechanisms are at play in UPFs being associated with worse health outcomes, including negative effects on the development of gut microbiota.\n\n“Many UPFs share more characteristics with cigarettes than with minimally processed fruits or vegetables and therefore warrant regulation commensurate with the significant public health risks they pose,” they concluded.\n\nOne of the authors, Prof Ashley Gearhardt of the University of Michigan, a clinical psychologist specialising in addiction, said her patients made the same links: “They would say, ‘I feel addicted to this stuff, I crave it – I used to smoke cigarettes [and] now I have the same habit but it’s with soda and doughnuts. I know it’s killing me; I want to quit, but I can’t.’”\n\nThe debate around UPFs fits a well-worn pattern in the field of addiction, according to Gearhardt. She said: “We just blame it on the individual for a while and say ‘oh, you know, just smoke in moderation, drink in moderation’ – and eventually we get to a point where we understand the levers that the industry can pull to create products that can really hook people.”\n\nWhile food, unlike tobacco, is essential for survival, the authors argue that the distinction makes action doubly necessary because it is difficult to opt out of the modern food environment.\n\nGearhardt said it should be possible to distinguish between harmful UPFs and other foodstuffs in the same way that alcoholic drinks are differentiated from other beverages.\n\nUPFs meet “established benchmarks” as to whether a substance should be considered addictive, the paper argues, with design features that “can drive compulsive use” – although “the harms of UPFs are clear, irrespective of their addictive nature”.\n\nThe authors suggested that lessons from tobacco regulation, “including litigation, marketing restrictions and structural interventions”, could offer a guide to reducing harm related to UPFs, calling for public health efforts to “shift from individual responsibility to food industry accountability”.\n\nProf Martin Warren, chief scientific officer at the Quadram Institute, a specialist food research centre, said that while there were parallels between UPFs and tobacco, the authors risked “overreach” in their comparisons.\n\nThere were questions, he said, over whether UPFs were, like nicotine, “intrinsically addictive in a pharmacological sense, or whether they mainly exploit learned preferences, reward conditioning and convenience”.\n\nHe said it was also important to consider whether the adverse health effects attributed to UPFs came from their contents, or because they replaced “whole foods rich in fibre, micronutrients and protective phytochemicals”. He said: “This distinction matters, because it influences whether regulatory responses should mirror tobacco control or instead prioritise dietary quality, reformulation standards, and food system diversification.”\n\nDr Githinji Gitahi, chief executive of Amref Health Africa, said: “This journal article reinforces a growing public health alarm sounding across Africa [where] corporates have found a comfortable, and profitable, nexus: weak government regulation on harmful products and a changing pattern of consumption.\n\n“All this places new and preventable pressures on already stretched health systems,” he said. “Without publicly led interventions on the rising burden of non-communicable diseases, we risk health systems’ collapse.”",

    "fullText": "For any Super Bowl party, the air fryer is the real MVP.\n\nWith the Super Bowl just around the corner on February 8, it's time to build a roster of easy air-fryer recipes to feed your guests in time for kickoff.\n\nAir fryers have become a popular kitchen gadget, found in around two-thirds of US homes, according to market-research firm Circana.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to cookbook authors Todd Porter and Diane Cu-Porter, the writers behind Air Fryer World, about their go-to game-day appetizers for the air fryer, and also dug into popular recipes that can be made in the appliance.\n\nHere are 10 easy game-day foods you can make in an air fryer.\n\n\"You can definitely use the air fryer if you like crispy foods, appetizers, and chicken wings,\" said Todd Porter and Diane Cu-Porter, the bloggers behind Air Fryer World.\n\nOne suggestion they had for air-fried game-day foods is air-fried chicken wings.\n\n\"Wings are awesome in the air fryer! The hot circulating air makes them naturally crispy, but for extra crunch, use cornstarch for an awesome crust,\" they said.\n\nTo follow Air Fryer World's recipe for ultra-crispy wings, toss your slightly dried chicken wings with your desired spices and olive oil. Make sure your air fryer is pre-heated to 400 degrees Fahrenheit before adding them. When they're done, usually in under 10 minutes, toss your wings in your favorite sauce and put them on the table, ready to eat.\n\nAnother game-day appetizer is Air Fryer World's recipe for jalapeño poppers with bacon. To make them, start by stuffing hollowed-out jalapeño peppers with cream cheese and cheddar, wrap them in bacon, and cook for 10 to 12 minutes at 380 degrees Fahrenheit until the bacon is crispy.\n\nYou can also buy premade frozen poppers and use the air fryer to crisp them up, by following this recipe.\n\nTo make them, roll mini sausages or hot dogs in crescent dough and set your air fryer to 325 degrees Fahrenheit, according to this Pillsbury recipe. For an even cook, you want to ensure the pigs in a blanket aren't overcrowded, so you might want to make them in rounds if you're making a lot.\n\nHowever, they should only take a few minutes to get nice and crispy, so they'll still be on the table by kickoff.\n\nFrozen tater tots can easily be made in the air fryer by spraying an even layer with a little cooking spray and tossing them halfway through the cooking cycle.\n\nThen, get to work choosing your toppings. You can create a loaded tater-tot bar, with additions like sour cream, chopped green onions, shredded cheese, queso, store-bought salsa, or guacamole.\n\nIf you want to go the extra mile, sauté some bacon or chorizo in a saucepan and top your loaded tots to your heart's content.\n\nThese \"fries,\" which The Recipe Critic calls \"a low-carb, keto-friendly snack,\" pair well with multiple sauces, including ketchup, ranch, or even a spicy mayo. For a little added flavor, mix garlic powder or cayenne into your breading before tossing it with olive oil-topped zucchini slices.\n\nTo make, pre-cook your hollowed-out potato skins and place them inside the air fryer, skin-side down, according to one recipe by Air Fryer Eats.\n\nWhen they're almost crispy, fill them with your choice of cheese and stick them back in the air fryer for a few minutes. Then, top with bacon, green onion, or sour cream.\n\nWhether you choose to go classic Italian with your flavors or dip your cooked meatballs in barbecue sauce, making meatballs in an air fryer is much faster than a typical oven and will be just as delicious.\n\nAir Fryer World recommends placing an even layer of meatballs into the air fryer and baking them at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for between 7 and 12 minutes until they're golden brown.\n\nYou can either bread your own shrimp, like this recipe from All Recipes, or follow the instructions on the back of most frozen coconut-shrimp packages for cooking them in the air fryer.\n\nServe with a tartar sauce or spicy mayo.\n\nAir Fryer World says that for perfectly crispy dumplings, you'll want to spray them with a little cooking spray before frying them. To get both sides evenly cooked, flip them over at the eight-minute mark and continue cooking for a few more minutes until they're done.\n\nServe with a little soy sauce and green onion.\n\nYou can make your favorite stuffed mushroom recipe as usual before air-frying, or go with Air Fryer World's recipe for cheesy stuffed mushrooms. Either way, moisten your air fryer basket or foil with cooking spray or olive oil and arrange your stuffed mushrooms evenly in the air fryer.\n\nPork sausage also works well as a filling, but you can also use spinach and cream cheese for a vegetarian twist.\n\nCook them at 360 degrees Fahrenheit for 6 to 8 minutes, then add the cheese and cook for another 2 minutes.",

    "description": "Bad Bunny opened Gekko, a Japanese steakhouse in Miami, in 2022. Ahead of his Super Bowl appearance, I wanted to see if it was worth the hype.",
    "fullText": "I was surprised by the restaurant's location, which is far from the exclusive, low-profile celebrity enclave I'd expected.\n\nInstead, it's located across from Brickell City Centre, a buzzy, crowded mall with a wide range of retailers, from mass consumer brands like Bath & Body Works, H&M, and Apple to more high-end retailers like Saks Fifth Avenue, Richard Mille, and Porsche Design.\n\nIt is also next to a gas station, and traffic makes the intersection loud and chaotic.\n\nMaking the reservation online was easier than I expected, especially for a Friday night during Miami's peak tourist season.\n\nWhen I booked it — only a couple of days before I went — nearly all dining times were available for inside, outside, and bar seating, suggesting that either the restaurant wasn't a highly popular choice or that reservations weren't always needed.\n\nWhen booking my reservation online, I had to agree to a dress code that forbade athletic wear, shorts, tank tops, cutoff sleeves, and flip flops, as well as \"athletic- or beverage-branded baseball hats.\"\n\nI didn't find the dress code restrictive at all; I saw it as the restaurant's effort to keep out overly casual patrons and to make dining there feel like an event.\n\nSitting inside the restaurant, I could see how high-profile guests might feel at home in its intimate space.\n\nThe tables set around the perimeter of the restaurant were dimly lit. Booths in the back and private dining areas indicated that the place was designed with privacy in mind.\n\nAfro-house and reggaeton music played throughout the restaurant — it was loud enough to conceal nearby conversations but not so loud that we needed to shout.\n\nA three-sided chef's counter at the center of the dining space felt like a stage for them and their work.\n\nHowever, the sushi chefs weren't eccentric performers. Instead, it felt like watching masters of their craft artfully handle their exclusive ingredients.\n\nThe menu, which has five steak offerings, also includes a section devoted to five different wagyu options, ranging from the $120 4-ounce A5 Hot Stone entrée to the $598 4-ounce olive-fed \"Wagyu Experience.\"\n\nAside from the steaks on the menu, wagyu is also featured in other dishes, from appetizers like wagyu crispy rice, dumplings, and steak tacos, to surf-and-turf nigiri with lobster.\n\nI got the wagyu crispy rice, one of the restaurant's most popular appetizers. At $34, it's also one of the most affordable wagyu items on the menu, and it's meant to be shared.\n\nThe dish came with four pieces of fried rice squares topped with raw wagyu tartare and crispy capers.\n\nThe raw meat was the star of the show, with each rice square featuring a generous portion of the tartare. It had a strong, spicy, slightly acidic flavor that complemented the velvety, rich beef. The crispy capers were the cherry on top, and I found myself craving those more than the wagyu itself.\n\nFrom looking at Gekko's menu, you know what kind of crowd would most usually dine here, and what their tax brackets might be.\n\nItems on the menu feature ingredients like caviar and lobster, and don't shy away from using 24-karat gold leaf. I tried to pick as many of the glitzier dishes as I could while staying within a reasonable budget.\n\nFor my main bites — all two of them — I got the gold-topped otoro nigiri, which was $19 a piece, and the surf-and-turf nigiri, which featured torched wagyu and lobster, and cost $17 for one piece.\n\nWhile other nigiri pieces were half the price for a comparable portion, I went into the meal hoping to test whether the upcharge and hype were worth it.\n\nThe gold-topped otoro nigiri was silky and melted in my mouth. Even as someone who isn't the most well-versed in the difference between cuts of tuna, I could tell that the quality of the fish was unlike any I had tried at more affordable price points.\n\nI felt similarly about the surf-and-turf nigiri bite. The thin-sliced torched wagyu had a delicious smoky flavor, and the bite was velvety, with the wagyu's marbling making for a really pleasant texture.\n\nIf each bite wasn't the price of a full budget meal, I could've devoured a few more.\n\nIn trying out some of the most expensive items, I found that some high-end elements, like the gold leaf or the lobster, didn't play as much of a role as I expected for the price point, and that I would've enjoyed the dishes just as much without them.\n\nFor a total of $164 after tax and tip, I only got six bites of food: four in the crispy rice appetizer, which was labeled as an item to share, and one bite in each of the nigiri.\n\nThe total also included two drinks and dessert.\n\nWhile the bites were excellent and well-balanced, I felt some components of the dishes were just fancy for the sake of looking expensive and didn't add much to the dish for me, like the 24-karat gold leaf on the tuna nigiri.\n\nAt \"only\" $24, which felt reserved compared to some of the other menu items, the miso dulcey lava cake was the most worth-it item from my visit, and I wouldn't hesitate to come back just for it.\n\nThe decadent, made-on-demand dessert, which came with a 15-minute wait as staff prepared it, featured silky vanilla ice cream, shortbread crumbles, and icing printed with the restaurant's logo.\n\nThe cake itself had a crispy, toasted exterior and a rich, miso-and-dulce-de-leche filling that spilled out. Paired with the ice cream and crumbs, this dessert was the standout for me.",

    "fullText": "Plastic pollution is an enormous global problem, and a lot of focus has been rightly placed on the devastating effects that plastic is having on our oceans and marine life. But plastic pollution on land is a big problem, too, as experts have recently been reminded when they started discovering giant blobs of the stuff inside the stomachs of dead camels.\n\nCalifornia-based environmental scientist Marcus Eriksen and United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based veterinary microbiologist Ulrich Wernery co-authored an article titled \"The plight of camels eating plastic waste.\"\n\nEriksen described one autopsy as \"the most surreal thing in the world,\" and their findings showed that plastic clumps called polybezoars, which Eriksen said \"range from the size of a basketball to roughly a large suitcase,\" are responsible for 1% of the camel deaths in the UAE\n\n\"All [camels] know in the desert [is] if it's not sand, it's food,\" Eriksen said. \"If they see a plastic bag stuck in a tree … or stuck against a fence, they might think, 'Oh, that's a novel piece of food,' and they'll consume it.\"\n\nThe effects of eating plastic are devastating for the camels, causing intestinal blockages, creating lacerations inside their stomachs, and creating a toxic environment for bacteria to grow amid the folds of the plastic.\n\n\"It's a slow death,\" Eriksen said. \"Imagine if you had five plastic bags crushed up in your body, and maybe a dozen bottle caps and a few straws, and it stayed there for years. I mean, you would suffer until you'd ultimately perish from that ingested trash. And that's what the camels are experiencing.\"\n\nCamels are not the only land animals facing this challenge, either. A sick bear in Colorado was recently euthanized and found to have plastic waste blocking its digestive system. Plastic waste consumption also killed two elephants in Sri Lanka.\n\nAs plastic waste causes more and more animal deaths, there is some hope that public pressure will cause governments to regulate it more heavily. Canada banned single-use plastics in 2021, and other places, such as Massachusetts, have taken similar steps.\n\nAs far as steps we can take to reduce our plastic consumption in our regular lives, we can make sure we understand how to recycle as effectively as possible and shun single-use plastics by using things like reusable water bottles.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the coolest innovations improving our lives and saving our planet.",

    "fullText": "Argentine cherry growers are facing a challenging season with severe rain and hailstorms. Production and exports have fallen due to this change in climate. The damaged crop has threatened global food supplies and farmers' livelihoods.\n\nEurofruit reported that poor weather caused Argentine cherry shipments in the last quarter of 2025 to hit a low.\n\nPlanet protection agency SENASA confirmed that cherry shipments totaled 3,760 tonnes (over 4,100 tons). This is a 38% decrease from last year and 19% below the five-year average.\n\nThe \"sector [is] on course for its worst season since 2019,\" per the report.\n\nGrowers projected good-quality crops to exceed last year's totals.\n\nAccording to Eurofruit, rain and hailstorms damaged \"the main producing areas\" instead. Much of the crop went to the domestic market.\n\nShifts in export markets are also happening in the 2025/26 season. Despite the drop in volumes, the U.S. is becoming the top destination (36%), while China's share fell (26%).\n\nBad weather in Argentine cherry production indicates how an overheating planet impacts crops. Farming communities and importing countries rely on crops for food and to support their economies.\n\nFrequent extreme weather events, which have been increasing, damage agricultural yields. Financial losses for farmers ensue, jeopardizing their ability to sustain their operations. Reduced harvests leave consumers with less supply in international markets. Scarcity in fruits such as cherries could also lead to higher prices.\n\nDisrupted food systems, driven by unpredictable weather, foreground a changing climate.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nMore expensive groceries and reduced availability of fresh produce are consequences of this. Food supply chains can be fragile as weather events cause downturns across continents.\n\nClimate-related threats to a stable and affordable food supply are local and global.\n\nThe agricultural sector is focusing on strategies to build resilience against extreme weather.\n\nInfrastructure investments such as anti-hail netting and improved drainage systems can protect crops. Developing climate-resilient crop varieties and adopting adaptive farming techniques are also crucial steps.\n\nReducing planet-warming pollution from coal, gas, and oil is essential. Doing so stabilizes global temperatures and mitigates extreme weather events that ruin agriculture.\n\nConsumers can support policies that advocate for sustainable agriculture and climate action. Understanding the critical climate issues at hand helps find the right solutions.\n\nThe current cherry season in Argentina has its setbacks. Climate-based farming practices offer hope for a future with more stable food production.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Hamburger chains dominated the fast-food sector in the 1980s and '90s after the \"burger wars\" launched among McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's.\n\nThe burger wars transitioned into an original chicken sandwich war, also in the 1980s, among the same three rivals. It was revived in the new millennium with Popeyes' launch of its chicken sandwich in August 2019.\n\nRival Chick-fil-A countered Popeyes' new sandwich with a statement on Twitter that its sandwich was the original, introduced in 1964, and fast-food chains everywhere began introducing or reintroducing chicken sandwiches.\n\nWith all of these chicken sandwiches launching, fried chicken restaurants became the most popular concept in fast food.\n\nFried chicken dining chains are likely to remain the most popular subsector of the fast-food industry in 2026, if the concept continues the trend it set over the last year.\n\nTraffic to chicken concepts rose 3% in the year ending September 2025, while all concepts dropped 1% compared to the previous year, according to market research firm Circana, as reported by Fast Company.\n\nThe variety of chicken options offered, such as chicken pieces, chicken fingers, or chicken sandwiches, and how consumers enjoy their choices, may contribute to the continued popularity of the concept, an expert says.\n\n“This is due to the experiences the brands are creating as well as the variety of chicken and how you can enjoy it,” industry expert Reilly Newman of Motif Brands told The Food Institute. “This comes to no surprise, as the experience economy has been taking root across the globe.\n\n“Chicken allows for (ample) customization, sauces, and forms, depending on the buyer’s preferences,” Newman said.\n\nNot every fast-food chicken restaurant benefited from increased traffic in 2025, as some operators suffered financial difficulties that led to bankruptcy filings.\n\nA bankrupt operator of more than 130 Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen franchise restaurants has closed 17 underperforming locations in Florida and Georgia and filed a motion to reject all of the stores' leases.\n\nThe franchisee, Sailormen Inc., which declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Jan. 15, filed a motion in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida in Miami to reject the leases after closing eight locations on Jan. 19, five locations on Jan. 20, and four locations on Jan. 22, according to court papers.\n\nThe debtor asserts that the leases should be rejected as of the petition date, since the restaurants were closed within one week of the petition date and before the hearing on the debtor's first-day motions.",

    "description": "Cubans from all walks of life are hunkering into survival mode, navigating lengthening blackouts and soaring prices for food, fuel and transport as the U.S.",
    "fullText": "HAVANA, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Cubans from all walks of life are hunkering into survival mode, navigating lengthening blackouts and soaring prices for food, fuel and transport as the U.S. threatens a stranglehold on the communist-run nation.\n\nTogether, those discussions paint a picture of a ​people pushed to the limit as goods and services - particularly those tied to ever more limited fuel supplies - become scarcer and more expensive.\n\nFor much of rural Cuba, this is not entirely new. The island's frail and antiquated power generation system ‌has been slowly failing for years and residents have grown accustomed to spending hours at a time without functioning electricity, internet or water pumps.\n\nBut the seaside capital, where the streets are lined with 1950s-era cars and colorful if decrepit Spanish colonial architecture, has until recently fared better.\n\nNow crisis looks set to swamp it, too, as fuel shortages ‌take hold, with first Venezuela, then Mexico halting oil shipments to the island.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has said tariffs will be imposed on imports from countries that supply Cuba with oil, ratcheting up the pressure on Washington's long-time foe in the wake of the ousting of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a key Cuban ally, in early January.\n\nIn many other countries, the conditions would have sent people out into the streets. So far, in a nation where dissent has long been curbed, there has been little sign of protest. But it is unclear how much more Cubans will be willing to endure.\n\nCuba's peso has lost more than 10% of its value against the dollar in three weeks, pushing up the price of groceries.\n\n\"This has put me in an impossible situation,\" said Yaite Verdecia, a Havana resident and housewife. \"There's no salary that can cope with this.\"\n\nDAILY LIFE GETTING ⁠MORE DIFFICULT\n\nTrump, when asked about the prospect of a U.S. military intervention in Cuba shortly after ‌the capture of Maduro, said he did not think an attack was necessary because \"it looks like it's going down.\"\n\nOn Friday, Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez declared an \"international emergency\" in response to the U.S. tariff warning, which he said constituted \"an unusual and extraordinary threat.\"\n\nBut the government has said little about how it will manage the growing threat of humanitarian crisis.\n\nMany of the Cubans Reuters spoke with said daily life - already difficult - had ‍been reduced to basics like assuring food, fuel for cooking, and water, and that it had become noticeably harder in recent days.\n\nLines for gasoline have grown significantly this week at a handful of service centers in the city still supplied with fuel. And since the U.S. blocked Venezuelan deliveries of oil to Cuba in mid-December, virtually all gas has been sold at a premium, in dollars - a currency to which few Cubans have access.\n\n\"It used to be that you could sign up and get fuel once a month (in pesos),\" said Havana resident Jesus Sosa, referring to an app that would let residents know ​when it was their turn to fill up their cars. \"Not anymore. Sales in national currency have stopped.\"\n\n'YOU HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE OR STAY HOME'\n\nThe crunch has hit both public and private transportation, putting some buses and private taxis out of business and forcing ‌others to raise their prices.\n\nDaylan Perez, a 22-year-old who hails private taxis for clients in old Havana, said fewer buses mean people now have no choice but to pay rising fees for private transport.\n\n\"You have to pay the price or stay home,\" he said.\n\nEven transportation by electric vehicle - once thought to be a panacea in a city short of fuel - has been hit by blackouts that now last for eight to 12 hours or more.\n\nTaxi driver Alexander Leyet of Havana swapped to an electric three-wheeled taxi recently, thinking he had outsmarted the pack.\n\n\"Now because of the blackouts I can only charge my taxi for four or five hours,\" he said.\n\nFor decades, the government that has its roots in Fidel Castro's 1959 Cuban Revolution has survived despite sometimes brutal economic struggles, upending regular predictions of imminent collapse or an uprising.\n\nIt has long alleged a U.S.-led effort to foment revolt, but the most recent widespread protests were in the pandemic year of 2021, despite a 12% contraction of the economy between 2019 and 2024.\n\nSharp crackdowns on any form of dissent, combined with the emigration of between one and ⁠two million people since the pandemic, have all but eliminated organized in-country opposition. The Cubans interviewed by Reuters generally declined to answer questions about the prospect ​of protests.\n\nBut none of those interviewed disputed that change was necessary.\n\n\"I'm just praying God finds a way to get us out of this (mess),\" said Mirta ​Trujillo, a 71-year-old street vendor from Guanabacoa who burst into tears as she told Reuters she could no longer afford food. Previously, she had depended on a ration book of basic goods provided by the government, but that was phased out post-pandemic as tourist income and other sources of hard currency dried up.\n\n\"I'm not against my country... but I don't want to die of hunger,\" she said.\n\nOn a recent weekday evening, Reuters witnessed an ‍accident at a busy intersection in Havana where the stoplights were not ⁠functioning as a result of a power outage.\n\n\"Sometimes when the power goes out, accidents happen because the traffic lights don't work,\" said Raysa Lemu, whose apartment overlooks a boulevard in Marianao, on the outskirts of Havana.\n\n\"It used to be they turned off the power two or three times a week, but now it's every day and sometimes it's up to 12 hours.\"\n\nJulia Anita Cobas, a 69-year-old housekeeper from Guanabacoa, gets up at 4 a.m. each morning for a 10-mile (16-km) commute that now approaches four ⁠hours round-trip. With less public transportation available, the journey has become longer and more costly.\n\n\"I leave my house before sunrise and I don't know how I'll get back,\" she said.\n\nBut Cobas, who was born just before Castro's revolution, said she had no expectation that Trump would make things any better.\n\n\"Since I was born the (United States) ‌has been threatening us, and every day we deal with hardship. But we've survived it all,\" she said.\n\nAimee Milanes, a 32-year-old resident of Reparto Electrico, just outside Havana, said neither the Cuban nor the U.S. government offered her ‌much hope.\n\n\"We're drowning. But there's nothing we can do,\" said Milanes. \"This is about survival. Nothing else.\"",

    "description": "Turkish Airlines is considered the best airline in Europe. Besides a few complaints, I get the hype — and I'd actually recommend eating the food.",
    "fullText": "I've flown coach on most major European and North American carriers, and economy food rarely makes a mark. Air Canada, British Airways, and United didn't exactly impress; Finnair and Delta were better, but not memorable.\n\nMy recent Turkish Airlines flight from New York to Istanbul, though, was beyond the norm.\n\nThe airline was named Europe's best economy class in the 2025 Skytrax awards, which evaluate cabin service, seating, and catering. Despite a few complaints, I could see why.\n\nPassengers received printed menus ahead of the meal service, detailing mains and sides — including salmon — all served with real cutlery. It wasn't the usual \"chicken or pasta,\" and the food tasted as good as it looked.\n\nTurkish outsources its New York catering to the Austrian company DO & CO. While DO & CO prepares meals for multiple airlines, Turkish sets its own standards for ingredients, plating, and presentation — which helps explain why the food looked and tasted a cut above competitors.\n\nThe Boeing 787 seat was otherwise in line with competitors, with a headrest and power, though the provided headphones were scratchy. The seatback screen, however, was among the largest I've seen in economy.\n\nI also appreciated the linens and storage, and the deep recline made sleeping easier — though it comes with a trade-off: to comfortably watch TV or avoid feeling cramped, everyone needs to recline.\n\nThis isn't ideal for using the tray table for work or streaming, and it relies on everyone cooperating. While I personally don't mind, those on the \"you should not recline\" side of the viral debate may find this frustrating.\n\nHere's what the full nine-hour economy flight on Turkish was like.\n\nThe flight was operated by a Boeing 787, equipped with Turkish' most modern economy cabin. The midday departure is currently the only 787 option on the route; overnight flights still use the older 777, which has noticeably dated screens and onboard tech.\n\nI wanted to fly Turkish's most up-to-date product. You'll also find similarly modern seats on most of the airline's Airbus A350-900s.\n\nI didn't check a bag and checked in via the Turkish app, meaning I could skip the desk and head straight to security. But I noticed the check-in area had a long line that wrapped around the corner.\n\nThe desk closes 60 minutes before departure, so arriving early — or sticking to carry-on only — may save you some time.\n\nThe Turkish Business Lounge is part of the Priority Pass network, which I access through my Chase Sapphire Reserve credit card.\n\nIt was small but offered free food and drinks, including eggs, meat, muffins, yogurt, and vegetables. There were no alcoholic beverages, but it was a comfortable place to pass the time with views of the ramp.\n\nI always pay extra for an aisle on long-haul flights so I can get up without disturbing others. I chose seat 26C, the closest aisle seat to the front at that price point.\n\nEconomy is arranged in a 3-3-3 layout, and each seat has 31 inches of pitch — the space between seatbacks — and 17.4 inches of width.\n\nWhile headrests are now common across the industry, I appreciated the extra seatback compartments for organizing cables, headphones, and snacks.\n\nBefore the first meal service, the crew handed out warm towels, water, and printed menus detailing each course. Lunch, as we were departing midday, included a choice of grilled salmon or mushroom orecchiette, followed by sides and dessert.\n\nBreakfast, served about 1.5 hours before our 6:30 a.m. local arrival, was a choice between a tomato-and-cheese omelet or a waffle with blueberry purée and vanilla sauce. It's easy to see why Turkish won Skytrax's award for best economy catering.\n\nDespite my skepticism, the salmon, served with ratatouille, Caesar salad, and celeriac mousseline, was fresh and flavorful, and the portions were generous. I was full by the time I got to the carrot cake.\n\nThe waffle was fluffy and sweet, paired with fruit, cheese, and bread. Beer and wine were complimentary with lunch, and I enjoyed the Turkish beer.\n\nWhile nothing beats the bidet on Japan's All Nippon Airways, I was surprised to find both a makeup mirror and a full-size mirror in the lavatory — a convenient touch for freshening up.\n\nI don't usually recommend eating airline food if you can avoid it, but Turkish seems to have figured it out. The meals felt lighter and more satisfying than usual, similar to what I've experienced on five-star carriers like Singapore Airlines.\n\nThe main drawback is the seat recline, which may frustrate travelers who want to work and find their workspace cramped by the seat ahead of them.\n\nTurkish also doesn't have a premium economy cabin, and only a few rows have extra legroom. Taller passengers should book early to secure bulkhead seats.",

    "fullText": "In BBC Sport's Eat & Yap series, Alex Scott meets some of the best WSL players to share the food they love and to chat about life on and off the pitch.\n\nWatch the interview in full now on BBC iPlayer\n\nKerstin Casparij has been setting the pace down the flanks for league leaders Manchester City all season.\n\nOn the latest episode of Eat & Yap, while teaching Alex Scott how to create the Dutch delicacy oliebollen, she reveals how she ended up with a cat tattoo, why her girlfriend thought she was a gardener and why team-mate Vivianne Miedema causes her to swear in Dutch.\n\nAlex: OK, so talk to me, what's on the menu.\n\nKerstin: All right, so you'll see a massive pan of oil, which I know doesn't look too nice, but I've been able to prep some butter and this is for a snack called oliebollen.\n\nAlex: So this is a bit of home?\n\nKerstin: It is very Dutch and we only have them around New Year's. You can only get the packaging around New Year's as well. Don't look at the calories actually, because that's why we don't have them all year round!\n\nAlex: Some recipes had currants and raisins for this...\n\nKerstin: I don't like the raisins!\n\nAlex: We're on the same wavelength there! I'll warn you, I'm not very good at hiding things if I don't like them.\n\nKerstin: Alex, I'm Dutch. Do I look like the type that hides it?\n\nAlex: Talk to me a bit more about life at home because you grew up in what, a remote part of the Netherlands?\n\nKerstin: So I'm a northern girl. I'm from a province called the Friesland and I'm very lucky that I grew up in a small town where a lot of sports are available. Playing was like a two-minute walk from where I used to live, which was perfect.\n\nAlex: I feel like it was always definite you were going to go on and be an athlete then?\n\nKerstin: Well, my parents met both playing for the Dutch national team and they both did judo, so there was no choice other for us than to do sports.\n\nAlex: How did the people back home describe you back then?\n\nKerstin: People mostly described me as loud, very chatty - I'm raging ADHD. I've calmed down a little bit now but as a child I was all over the shop. It was such a good thing, growing up and wanting to become an athlete, because I was so hyper-focused on football.\n\nAlex: Sometimes that's hard to navigate, so how did you do that?\n\nKerstin: At that time I was really struggling to keep up in school, to get ready for tests and also do all my football. Once I had the diagnosis, I was speaking to psychologists and my parents were very supportive. It takes time and I still have a lot of things to learn about myself.\n\nAlex: Would you say Manchester feels like home for you now?\n\nKerstin: Definitely. I think the people here are so nice. That's one of the things I heard when I was going to join. I live here with my girlfriend - we've got our cats.\n\nAlex: So you met your girlfriend in Manchester?\n\nKerstin: We met on Tinder in Manchester. It was great for me because I was a bit lonely, living on my own and I was just excited to meet other people outside my team-mates. I love my team-mates but sometimes you want to see other people as well.\n\nAlex: Sometimes that's the part that's hard to explain. Yes, you are fully immersed in football but it's equally as important to have other hobbies.\n\nKerstin: My girlfriend always says: 'You've got such a football perspective' and also just work-life balance. It's so different than she has, working nine to five and being off at weekends. Your work is not your life, not your personality and it doesn't define who you are. Being able to see that side of it and her allowing me to step away is really nice.\n\nAlex: You said you met on Tinder?\n\nKerstin: Yeah and to be fair, I was debating whether to go on Tinder. This was at the point in my career where I wasn't that known.\n\nAlex: Did I read you didn't put any photos up on Tinder of you in football kit?\n\nKerstin: I didn't put any bio - I didn't put any pictures of football. So Ruth had no idea that I was even sporty. She thought I was a gardener because I was tanned… She had no idea about football so it was fun to introduce her to the world and now she's a massive fan. She knows all the gossip! Sometimes she comes home and she tells me these things and I'm like: 'How do you know this?'\n\nAlex: So you've got Ruth, and now two cats?\n\nKerstin: Kiwi and Mango. Both fruits. I got Kiwi because I was on my own and I was very lonely. Then I met Ruth a couple of months later and we're both away quite a lot so we thought we should get Kiwi a brother.\n\nAlex: And next level, you have a tattoo.\n\nKerstin: Yes, I've got a tattoo of them. Should I show you? I've got a tattoo of them looking into a wine glass just because they're cute and silly.\n\nAlex: Are you fully immersed in Manc life? What kind of slang words?\n\nKerstin: I kinda just copy everyone else.\n\nAlex: What about when you're back with the Dutch team?\n\nKerstin: I definitely struggle having to switch to Dutch again, like finding the words because I only speak Dutch with my mum.\n\nAlex: What are the team meetings like in Manchester City then? Is it fully English or do you have translators?\n\nKerstin: It's all English. I know some that do struggle a little bit and when they have a meeting with the coach, they do have a translator to make sure they're being heard. To be fair, team meetings are really good. Andree [Jeglertz] really made a point about it being really open. We're all in a massive circle rather than an auditorium so when you speak you can actually look directly at each other. We really work together and everybody has a voice.\n\nAlex: You do team bonding stuff?\n\nKerstin: We've made it a very big thing to have a lot of team activities this year. So I'm captain of the team activity crew together with Laura Coombs. We went to Crystal Maze the other day with players and staff, which we've made a big thing. We want to get together with the staff as well, just to get that connection.\n\nAlex: It's how they know you away from the field as well.\n\nKerstin: Yeah, exactly. More of your personality. Sometimes it can be a bit of a step to approach someone in a leadership role and to get everybody together and just do something fun away from the club in your own clothes creates such a nice bond. You actually have conversations that you might not have at the club.\n\nAlex: I think you've done a cooking class didn't you? How did that go?\n\nKerstin: It was a success - it was Italian dishes. Some people made amazing risotto, they were getting the lemon in and it looked unreal. Some people burned it and some people were screaming that it was sticking to the pan.\n\nAlex: Come on, name names. Who's the bad cook?\n\nKerstin: I'm not going to expose my team-mates.\n\nAlex: Let's talk about temptations and cravings, because people are starting to talk about Manchester City potentially lifting the WSL trophy this season. Are you believing? Why are you laughing at me?\n\nKerstin: I mean, it's kind of funny because we were in such an underdog position going into this season. I felt like everybody was talking about Chelsea, Arsenal, [Manchester] United. It was kind of nice being left out of the conversation and I think we really took that as motivation.\n\nAlex: What do you think has changed?\n\nKerstin: It's little tweaks that matter the most, and also Andree's playing style. We get so much freedom, and also trust and responsibility. Previously it was a good system but a bit robotic at times. We do all the analysis and he gives us everything we need but if something's a bit different, he can't change that from the side. Leaving that space allows us to be adaptable on the pitch.\n\nAlex: What do you put your form down to?\n\nKerstin: I've got such a strong desire to show everybody what I can do and be the best that I can be. I'm really enjoying our offensive style of play this year and linking up with Bunny [Shaw] and Kerolin and all the other incredible forwards that we have. It's just been a joy to work. I go every day with a smile on my face.\n\nAlex: I've always wanted to learn about different cultures and I suppose you have that at Manchester City?\n\nKerstin: That's one of the things I love about football in general. We travel to these amazing places, but also my team-mates are from many different continents and cultures. It's been an eye-opener because I'm from a northern town in the Netherlands. We didn't have a lot of diversity growing up, so meeting these incredible people has been really inspiring.\n\nAlex: There are some cheeky elements to your game, which I absolutely love. Is this you trying to put the opposition off?\n\nKerstin: To be fair, I'm a bit annoying when I'm marking, like trying to push away. I'm not the tallest, I'm not the best at heading so I'm a blocker. Just be the annoying little fly, the little mosquito that doesn't let them head the ball.\n\nAlex: You've now got Dutch team-mate Vivianne Miedama at the club - what's it like having her at club level?\n\nKerstin: She's a fantastic player. In training, it looks so easy and she looks like she's putting in minimum effort and she bangs it into top bins. I swear at her in Dutch - no-one knows what I'm saying! She's such a good player to have with all her experience. A little bit of Dutchness can do wonders.\n\nWatch: Manchester City v Chelsea in the Women's Super League on Sunday, 1 February (14:30 GMT) on BBC One and BBC iPlayer\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "title": "I went on my first cruise — here are 15 things that surprised me about this type of travel",
    "description": "From room size to food quality, my first-ever cruise on board Royal Caribbean's Wonder of the Seas was full of surprises.",
    "fullText": "The ship has 18 decks and 2,867 staterooms, according to Royal Caribbean.\n\nI booked a mid-tier room — a step above windowless interior staterooms, a step below staterooms with a balcony, and two steps below suites.\n\nMy 179-square-foot cabin had a private bathroom, a king-size bed, and an ocean view.\n\nI was surprised by how big the discount was. To me, $1,000 feels like a huge price difference for the same vacation.\n\nI thought the stateroom made great use of a small space with plenty of storage for my clothes and other belongings. There were two closets for hanging space and more drawers than I used.\n\nAfter leaving to start my day each morning, a stateroom attendant cleaned my room. And after I left for dinner each night, they came back to clean up again. Every evening, they brought me fresh towels — sometimes creatively folded — and a flyer featuring the next day's schedule, including the weather, dress code, and any other important information, such as a time change.\n\nThis surprised me because I am used to having my room serviced once daily, if at all, during my hotel stays, and never in Airbnbs.\n\nAn electronic shade over the window could be lowered to reveal grand views. I loved waking up after a night at sea to a front-row view of the place I'd be visiting that day.\n\nWhile windowless rooms are cheaper, I couldn't imagine staying in one. My ocean-view stateroom cost about $300 more than an entry-level room.\n\nI booked a stateroom at the front of deck eight and felt constant motion in my room.\n\nSome nights were rockier than others. On the roughest nights, I heard and felt a similar sensation to thunder beneath me every few minutes. Loud thumps and heavy vibrations in my room sounded like large pieces of furniture falling. The first night this happened, I feared the worst, but over time, I realized that this was a normal aspect of cruising — but one I would likely never get used to.\n\nAfter talking to seasoned cruisers on the ship, several told me that the front of the ship is one of the worst places to be for feeling motion. Higher decks in the middle of the ship feel calmer and more stable, they said.\n\nNext time, I'd choose a room in the middle of the ship.\n\nAll I had to do for safety training was watch a couple of videos — either on my room TV or on the Royal Caribbean app — and then check in at my assembly station, the area I was assigned to in case of an emergency. At the assembly station, an attendant checked the Royal Caribbean app to confirm that I had completed the mandatory training.\n\nI was expecting to attend a large safety training session once I got on the ship, so this alternative was a breeze.\n\nSince there were so many elevators on the ship, I expected them to be a pretty efficient way to get around. But they were often so crowded and slow that I took the stairs instead. By the middle of my trip, unless I was going all the way up to the pool decks, I always opted for the stairs to save time.\n\nThe ship has 16 guest decks; each deck is divided into three sections — forward, middle, and aft.\n\nIt took me a few days to get used to the sections, and I often found myself heading to the right deck but the wrong section of the ship. Luckily, there were maps on every floor, which I used until the morning I left.\n\nIf I woke up on deck five of Wonder of the Seas with no memory of my cruise, I'd think I was in a shopping mall.\n\nAside from the slight movement of the ship, the indoor decks were so big that, as a cruise newbie, it was hard to believe that I was on a gigantic boat in the middle of the ocean. Everywhere I looked, I saw shops, stands, restaurants, large sculptures, and a unique ceiling structure that reminded me of the malls I've visited.\n\nAside from music festivals, I've never heard more live music on a trip than on this cruise. On the communal decks, musicians played for hours while people relaxed and played around them. I was also surprised by the eclectic mix of genres I heard, from rock to jazz to classical.\n\nIn addition to the music hall, where concerts were regularly held, live bands performed on indoor and outdoor communal decks. Some people watched, while others listened while swimming, relaxing, or walking around.\n\nI like to be comfy, so I was dreading formal nights going into this cruise.\n\nI brought one fancy dress with me to wear whenever I needed, but on the first formal night, I realized that the dress code wasn't strictly enforced. People wore a range of outfits, from evening gowns to T-shirts.\n\nFor the rest of the trip, I also relaxed my interpretation of the dress code.\n\nThe excursion I was most thrilled about — a hot-air balloon ride over the Bahamas — was canceled the day of because the winds were too high.\n\nIt was on the last day of my trip, and with only one day in port, it could not be rescheduled. It was the experience I was looking forward to most, so I was disappointed. On a cruise ship, I learned that all plans are subject to change based on things outside the crew's control, like the weather.\n\nSince we traveled such a long way to each port, I wrongfully assumed we'd spend more time in them. The ship usually docked around 8 a.m. and left in the early afternoon.\n\nI thought I'd have time to explore the port for a while after each excursion, but some of my excursions took the entire day, getting me back to the boat just in time for departure. I also hoped to see what these places looked like at night, but we never departed after sundown.\n\nAlthough I got a taste of the Caribbean, I didn't have enough time to get a sense of each place, which made me realize that I would probably prefer to vacation in just one place and have time to truly explore it.",

    "description": "Some of the best things to do in Greenville, South Carolina, are visit the city's festivals, enjoy great food, and walk across the Liberty Bridge.",
    "fullText": "I've lived just outside Greenville, South Carolina, for the past 11 years and can't imagine calling anywhere else home.\n\nNamed one of \"The South's Best Cities in 2025\" by Southern Living and one of \"Readers' 15 Favorite Cities in the US of 2025\" by Travel + Leisure, it's easy to see why the city has seemingly exploded in popularity.\n\nHere are six of my favorite things to do in and around Greenville.\n\nI don't need to go far to see a beautiful waterfall in Greenville. Falls Park on the Reedy is a gorgeous green space in the middle of downtown, and the Reedy River weaves through it.\n\nFor the best views, I like to either walk across the Liberty Bridge (a curved suspension bridge overlooking the falls) or sit on a swing in the park while enjoying some ice cream from Jeni's.\n\nFor an adventure that's a bit further from the city, I drive about 45 minutes out to Jones Gap State Park to hike the Rainbow Falls trail. It leads to a stunning waterfall that plunges about 100 feet over a granite cliff.\n\nLocated next to the city's local airport are two of my family's favorites: Runway Park and Takeoff Mini Golf.\n\nRunway Park has an aviation-themed playground, complete with a short, paved runway trail that kids love to ride their bikes and scooters around. There are also two picnic areas available to rent for events.\n\nMeanwhile, Takeoff Mini Golf is a 19-hole course that's aviation-themed, too. Fun fact: If you get a hole-in-one on the last shot, a beacon will light up.\n\nWhat's great about both places is that you can actually see the airplanes taking off and landing while you're there.\n\nGreenville is home to a number of festivals, and some of my favorites are Artisphere, held annually on Mother's Day weekend, and Fall for Greenville, held each year in October.\n\nArtisphere highlights the work of artists around the country, lining Main Street with everything from handmade ceramics and paintings to sculptures and photography.\n\nOne of my favorite art pieces I've ever purchased — a stunning shot of the synchronous fireflies in the Great Smoky Mountains — was from a photographer at Artisphere. Plus, there are live performances and great food.\n\nMeanwhile, Fall for Greenville features live entertainment and food from local restaurants. Years ago at the festival, I was introduced to the restaurant Soby's, and now I always recommend it to visitors.\n\nThe Roper Mountain Science Center is home to the Dinosaur Adventure Trail, which has a variety of life-size dinosaur models.\n\nIt's hilarious to sit near the T. rex and watch as unsuspecting guests are shocked when it moves as they walk by.\n\nThe trail is open most of the summer and on Thursdays and Fridays throughout the school year, with tickets required.\n\nGreenville is a sleeper foodie destination that's about to land on the map when the next season of \"Top Chef\" drops, featuring episodes filmed in the city.\n\nTo experience Greenville's food scene in person, I recommend taking the \"At the Chef's Table\" culinary tour with Greenville History & Culinary Tours.\n\nI did this a year after moving to the area, and it helped me learn about the city's interesting history and where to find great food.\n\nThe tour includes visits to local restaurants — including one of my favorites, The Lazy Goat (the whole branzino and any of the desserts are incredible) — with explanations of the dishes from the chefs.\n\nBeyond the tour, I also love the burgers and garlic Parmesan fries at Windy City Burgers on E Coffee Street.\n\nLess than an hour's drive from downtown Greenville is the Fred W. Symmes Chapel (more commonly known as Pretty Place), home of the most stunning sunrise I've ever seen.\n\nThe chapel overlooks the Blue Ridge Mountains, and watching the sun streak through the clouds is an amazing experience.\n\nBe sure to check the online schedule for operating hours, since it's also a popular venue for weddings.",

    "fullText": "Does Anne Michael Maye's cooking weigh up to the hype? Patriots fan weighs in originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAnne Michael Maye's infamous baked goods are finally being taste tested by fans - and the early reviews are favorable.\n\nThe wife of New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye went viral on TikTok in December, after she began sharing Martha Stewart-inspired cooking videos in a series she called \"Bakemas.\" The videos have resulted in her being nicknamed the \"Queen of the North,\" and she's become so popular from the holiday series that she's continued the tradition in January, so far sharing recipes for a simple but tasty egg naan bread, spaghetti squash, and chicken salad.\n\nIn honor of her success with \"Bakemas,\" Anne gave away some of her baked homemade cookies to passengers headed on JetBlue flights to the AFC Championship Game over the weekend. Several lucky Patriots fans on flights out of Denver and Boston got to taste Drake's wife's cooking when they were given a homemade M&M cookie wrapped in a cellophane bag with the message, \"Created by Anne Michael and served by JetBlue.\"\n\nThe wife of a Pats' fan who received one of the special treats shared a TikTok video on Monday, that showed her husband and a friend taste testing the cookies.\n\nAt the beginning of the clip, the two men, dressed in Patriots merch, held up the oversized M&M cookies, and one said, \"The cookie. Let's see.\"\n\nThey then took a bite in unison, and began happily shaking their heads, impressed with what they were tasting.\n\n\"It's pretty good. Tastes like victory,\" one said, before the other agreed, saying, \"Wow. That's a quality cookie. She knows her stuff.\"\n\nPrior to the taste test, the man encountered Anne walking into the stadium and got to tell her he tried her cookies.\n\n\"Anne! I had your cookie. It was awesome,\" he yelled excitedly, although it's unclear if Anne heard him, as she didn't respond back.\n\nThe lucky Pats fan was so excited about getting the special treat that he whipped out his cellphone and hit record when the free cookie announcement was being made on his flight.\n\nHis wife shared the sweet moment in a second video featuring a flight attendant announcing Anne's special giveaway. The TikTok user captioned the post, \"When my boyfriend is on his way to CO for the Pats game and gets a cookie made by THE queen of the North.\"\n\n\"ANNE MICHAEL GAVE US COOKIES,\" the post continued.\n\nIn the short clip, the JetBlue flight attendant said, \"Anne Michelle Maye who you know is related to a certain MVP contender, she partnered with us to give you guys a little extra game day fuel. Enjoy and let's go Patriots.\"\n\nKendall Jenner takes aim at athlete ex-boyfriends and 'Kardashian curse' in Super Bowl ad\n\nCristiano Ronaldo's fiancee Georgina Rodriguez stuns in chic black dress at 'Melania' premiere\n\nMatthew Stafford's wife shares touching moment at home after Rams' AFC loss\n\nCardi B bundles up in oversized fur coat and knee boots at Patriots AFC Championship game\n\nJake Paul's fiancee Jutta Leerdam flaunts cheeky bikini ahead of Winter Olympics",

    "description": "Not all ultra-processed foods are inherently evil. A nutrition researcher says to choose options low in sugar and sodium and add vegetables.",
    "fullText": "Nutrition researcher Kevin Hall is both a committed scientist and a realist. He knows: it's pretty near-impossible for us to avoid ultra-processed foods entirely, given the food environment we live in.\n\nHall has studied diet and metabolism for years. He spearheaded some of the biggest and most influential studies upending long-held nutrition dogmas in his lab at the National Institutes of Health, until he stepped down last year.\n\nOver the course of his 21-year career at the NIH, he made remarkable discoveries about the metabolisms of \"The Biggest Loser\" contestants, pitted low-fat against low-carb diets (spoiler alert: no clear winner there), and discovered that people really do eat more calories and gain more weight when they're offered ultra-processed meals. That watershed news sparked the current craze for \"whole\" and \"real\" food and \"clean\" eating plans.\n\nStill, Hall says you don't need to be so rigid with your food rules to eat well. He maintains that not all ultra-processed foods are equally bad.\n\n\"There are plenty of ultra-processed foods that are available to folks that are still reasonable in terms of their nutritional profile,\" Hall told Business Insider, when his new book, \"Food Intelligence\" was released in 2025.\n\n\"The example that I use a lot is marinara sauce that we buy,\" he said. \"It's ultra-processed. It has additives to increase the shelf life.\"\n\nReady-to-heat sauce makes it easier for Hall and his family to craft simple, quick, nutritious meals on busy school nights. The best part of the strategy, he says, is that it nudges his family into eating more vegetables.\n\nHall's most recent research on ultra-processed foods suggests mixing veggies into a dinner with other ultra-processed components is a great way to boost the nutrition and calorie profile. Ultra-processed foods tend to be very calorie-dense, whereas veggies are not.\n\n\"When you make a meal, even if it contains some ultra-processed products, and even if those ultra-processed products might not have very low numbers of calories per gram, by mixing in vegetables, it's lowering the overall calorie density of the meal,\" he said.\n\nHall's latest nutrition study, completed in late 2025, suggests that people don't necessarily have to gain weight when they're eating ultra-processed diets, as long as their convenience foods are relatively nutritious and complemented by plenty of veggies. Vegetables are, famously, full of vitamins and minerals, but they're also generally pretty low-calorie, and yet filling due to their high fiber content. (Some people call these \"high-volume foods\" and they're great for weight loss.)\n\nHall's quick draw dinner solution has three main components:\n\nHall refused to specify which brand is his personal favorite, but he said he makes sure whatever sauce he picks out is both low in added sugar and relatively low in sodium.\n\nComplex carbs are a great source of dietary fiber, helping you stay fuller for longer after a meal, in addition to other nutrition benefits from the vitamins and minerals packed inside.\n\nThe veggies can be fresh or frozen. Hall likes to grill his before he adds them to the pasta.\n\nHall simply incorporates the grilled veggies into the pasta, then pours the jarred marinara on top \"so you don't have to make it from scratch,\" he said. \"That marinara sauce is ultra-processed, but it's made a much more tasty meal that now has lots of vegetables in it and the whole grain pasta. And so you're using ultra-processed products to help make it easier for people to stick to the kinds of diets that nutrition scientists have recommended for a very long time.\"\n\nIf an ultra-processed food allows you easier, more inexpensive access to a tasty meal that's low in added sugar with more whole grains and vegetables than you would otherwise eat, Hall says that's a definitive win.\n\n\"Just because something's ultra-processed does not necessarily mean that you want to ban it or you want to get rid of that type of food,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Old Trafford has reportedly been awarded a five-star food hygiene rating following an inspection of Manchester United’s catering areas.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, the club’s matchday and hospitality operation has now returned to the top rating after a period of scrutiny.\n\nThere are supporters who have spent huge sums of money for hospitality, and thus want the basics done properly on a matchday.\n\nThis is, therefore, positive news for United fans off the pitch and a brilliant week from the team on it.\n\nThe report states that Old Trafford previously suffered a drop in its rating after issues were raised during inspections. These concerns were linked to food preparation and storage areas.\n\nThere were also claims of problems in suites and kiosks, with earlier coverage revealing Trafford Council’s environmental health officers had issued a lower rating after a visit.\n\nThe club, however, was working to make improvements, and that report noted United had pointed to tough measures and multiple weekly checks across catering areas.\n\nThe Daily Mail now explains that the latest inspection has restored the five-star score. This is a sign that changes have been made and processes tightened.\n\nOld Trafford is not just a stadium; it is also a weekly event site that serves huge numbers across general concourses, lounges and corporate spaces. When standards slip, the backlash is immediate – and this is because it affects paying fans, or customers, in real time.\n\nUnited have spoken a lot in recent years about raising standards across the club. This is one of those areas where improvement is not optional – it is the minimum expectation.\n\nIf the report is accurate, the hope is that the five-star rating is not a one-off headline. Rather, it is the new normal for the stadium experience.\n\nMichael Carrick and his revitalised Reds simply can’t stop winning on and off the pitch right now.\n\nFeatured image Christopher Furlong via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "As a frequent traveler who's been around the world, I fell in love with Bali. The island is home to great food, warm people, and lots of things to do.",
    "fullText": "As an American who's traveled to 44 countries over the last 30 years, I've seen my fair share of unforgettable places.\n\nBut if I had to choose one place to visit again and again, it would be Bali, an island and province in Indonesia that combines vibrant culture, natural beauty, and a pace of life that feels both energizing and restorative.\n\nAfter spending a month on the island in 2023, I fell in love. Here's what made my trip to Bali so special.\n\nOne of my favorite meals during my time in Bali came from a street vendor. The Javanese meal, called Tahu Tek, featured fried tofu, bean sprouts, a thick peanut sauce, and a pile of crackers on top. It cost me less than $2 (USD), but it was packed with flavor.\n\nBali's food scene goes far beyond street food, though. Even dining at restaurants felt affordable, making it easy to try local specialties, including babi guling, a traditional whole roasted pig.\n\nPlus, I could easily find international cuisine alongside local dishes.\n\nI often went to Milk & Madu, which served American-style food like pizza and burgers. I also loved spending mornings at cafés in Canggu, sipping smoothies and enjoying breakfast bowls.\n\nOne of the main things that makes Bali truly special is its people. I've been to many destinations where the locals aren't always open to expats and travelers. But here, everyone I met was warm, welcoming, and genuinely kind.\n\nFor example, I used an app called Grab, similar to Uber, where drivers can pick up passengers on their motorbikes or in their cars.\n\nI was wary about riding on the back of a stranger's bike, but the friendly drivers I had across several rides quickly made me feel at ease. Some would even check in with me during the ride to make sure everything was OK or to ask if I needed them to slow down.\n\nPlus, I found an amazing community of digital nomads, creatives, and expats who decided to trade their office jobs for laptops in cafés. As an American living abroad, this made me feel at home.\n\nIt gave me a sense of familiarity in a new environment and made it easier to connect, since there was no language barrier. I felt more comfortable starting conversations and sharing experiences with other expats and long-term travelers.\n\nDuring my time in Uluwatu, I met another nomad, and a simple conversation turned into spending the next few days together exploring. These kinds of moments felt much more natural and common in Bali than in other places I've visited, and I felt a strong sense of openness and connection.\n\nAnother thing I loved about Bali was the diverse range of activities available. Whether I was in the mood to visit temples or relax on the beach, there was always something to do.\n\nFor example, in Ubud, I wandered through the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary, where ancient temples sit under jungle canopies. There were signs everywhere warning visitors to hold onto their belongings, and for good reason. The sanctuary is home to over 1,260 monkeys, who I saw climbing railings and jumping between statues.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, I also visited Alas Harum, a tourism destination in Tegallalang with lots of opportunities for adventure. Here, I flew out on a giant swing that went over rice fields. Taking in the view from way above the terraces was equal parts terrifying and fun.\n\nAnd when I wanted to relax, I visited the beach clubs, where I lounged by the water with music playing and a drink in my hand.\n\nAfter traveling to 44 countries, I can confidently say I'm no stranger to exploring new places.\n\nEvery destination I've visited has shown me new ways of living, but in Bali, I experienced a way of life that felt joyful, balanced, and connected. Plus, the tropical, warm, and consistent weather didn't hurt either.\n\nBetween the amazing food, the warm people, and the sense of adventure, I'm already dreaming of my next trip to this beautiful island.",

    "description": "Amanda Litman and her husband hosted 52 dinner parties in 2025. It helped them feel less lonely as parents in a big city.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Amanda Litman, 35, who lives in New York City. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn December 2024, my husband and I had a three-month-old and two-year-old daughter, and we felt lonely and isolated. Having kids is magical, but it's a lot.\n\nOver the first couple of years of parenthood, we realized that it was really hard to make plans and find time to have conversations with grown-ups. We used to joke that everyone was lonely, but no one could hang out.\n\nYou can chat to other parents at the playground or see them at pickup, but after having kids, you lose the spontaneity of being able to go to the movies or out to dinner, or to a party at the drop of a hat. Things become logistically difficult. We would always question, \"Is the thing we're invited to worth whatever it will cost us to go, plus $150 for a babysitter?\"\n\nWe wanted to create some kind of social anchor in our lives, and my husband suggested that we set a New Year's resolution to host people for dinner every Saturday in 2025.\n\nAt first, I was like, \"I think you're insane. That's a stupid thing to do.\" But he's the cook in our family, not me, so I agreed.\n\nWe made a list of everyone we know, or would like to know, or could possibly plausibly invite, used a spreadsheet as a schedule, and started texting people.\n\nWe'd say, \"Hey, we have a resolution to host people at our house every Saturday. Do you want to come over for dinner X, Y, or Z weekend at five o'clock? Bring the kids!\" And as people would say yes, we would go back and forth with scheduling, and put them on the calendar.\n\nWe live in a two-bedroom apartment in New York City, so we tried to keep the dinner parties relatively contained. Our table can fit up to six people at a stretch, but we also sat on the floor, we ate on our couch, and the kids would climb all over the place.\n\nMost of the time, we'd host between one and three families. Our biggest party had 15 guests (11 adults and four kids), and our smallest had one.\n\nWe had a mix of really longtime friends, new friends, and people we'd never spoken to for more than 20 minutes. Sometimes people knew each other and other times the guests had never met, so we got the chance to help new people connect.\n\nAfter a few weeks, we got into a pretty good rhythm. On Monday, I would message whoever was scheduled for that Saturday, confirming dinner and asking if they had any dietary restrictions.\n\nMy husband used that to figure out what to cook. He likes the opportunity to make something ambitious. Some of my favorites were his Gochujang caramel cookies, lemon bars, lasagna, and fried chicken.\n\nHe would go to the grocery store, then cook a little bit on Thursday night or bake if he was making dessert or bread. He would do a little bit more on Friday night after the girls went to bed, and more on Saturday morning while we fussed around the house and the kids played. When the kids napped, between 1 and 4 p.m-ish, he would finish cooking.\n\nPeople would come over at 5 p.m. and leave around 7 p.m., sometimes 9 p.m., and occasionally 10 p.m. We're 35-year-olds with kids, so it didn't go on until 2 a.m.\n\nEvery Saturday around 3 p.m., when my husband was in the weeds of cooking, worrying about not finishing in time, and the kids were misbehaving, we'd be like, \"Should we just cancel?\" But we never did.\n\nWe felt almost compulsive about keeping our streak alive, and by the end of the evening, we were always glad to have hosted.\n\nI would clean the bathroom and counters and make the house hygienic, not immaculate. It's not a museum, and we made sure that our guests understood that we're welcoming them into our home as imperfect.\n\nAll of our dishes are mismatched because they're from two households combined over the years. We used formula pitchers for water jugs. We're not fancy, but we decided that was fine.\n\nSome weekends it was hard to find people who were in town, and a couple times guests cancelled at the last minute and we had to scramble to invite more people. Sometimes the kids would be chaotic or we'd break a wine glass, but generally, it was manageable.\n\nIn this moment, I think, people feel very lonely, and I'm really glad that we were able to take meaningful actions to fix that in our lives.\n\nDoing this was good for my mental health. 2025 was a hard year. I had two kids under two, I released a book, and my job working in politics was very hard. But despite all of that, I had a social life, time with my family and friends, and a clean bathroom every week. Plus I got to eat a lot of good food.\n\nWhen people are over, I'm not looking at my phone, and I have real adult conversation, which is rare for me, especially outside of work. And some people who used to be just acquaintances are now friends, which I feel like is really hard to do when you're an adult.\n\nI think it was really meaningful to have this thing that we did every week without question. It was just like, \"this is what we do, who are we seeing this week?\"\n\nOne thing I struggled with was letting go of reciprocity. We invite people a lot, but they don't invite us back. I had to remind myself that doesn't mean they don't like us.\n\nEveryone has a different sense of comfort with hosting and with being the planner versus the guest. There's no moral valence to being an inviter, and letting go of keeping score was both hard and important.\n\nWe're very proud that we achieved our resolution, and we're going to try and keep doing it into 2026. We'll be less strict if folks cancel last minute, but we're booked through March right now.",

    "fullText": "The post Alaskan Moose Tower Over Grizzlies In Rare Wilderness Footage appeared first on A-Z Animals.\n\nConfronting a 1,808-pound Alaskan Yukon moose requires grizzlies to prioritize safety over apex dominance.\n\nAn 80-inch antler span creates a physical constraint that prohibits grizzlies from engaging in close-quarter combat.\n\n700-pound bears are often physically outmatched by the largest deer species on Earth.\n\nScouting the summer salmon runs at Brooks River is necessary to witness this specific predatory avoidance behavior.\n\nGrizzly bears are one of the few apex predators. They’re at the top of the food chain and will attack almost anything if they’re hungry enough. Brown bears are also known to be incredibly territorial. They share the wilderness with other animals, such as cougars, birds, coyotes, and more.\n\nA real wilderness location, Katmai National Park and Preserve, is located about 260 miles southwest of Anchorage. The Valley of 10,000 Smokes’ surreal volcanic beauty attracts some visitors, but bears are the main draw.\n\nThe park is home to over 2,200 brown bears, many of whom concentrate on the Brooks River to gorge on the summer salmon runs, making it one of the greatest places in Alaska to see bears. A YouTube channel by the name “Bradjosephs” was visiting the area when he saw something peculiar.\n\nMultiple bears were foraging by the river, looking for fresh salmon to eat. In the distant meadow, a giant moose appears. Even though bears are territorial, they’ll rarely attack a moose. It’s too dangerous, even for a wild animal as ferocious as a grizzly.\n\nThe two animals walk almost side-by-side at one point, giving us viewers an idea of just how big the moose is. The average grizzly bear weighs around 700 pounds. Males can weigh anywhere between 400 and 790 pounds, making them heavier than females. A big female might weigh anything between 290 and 400 pounds.\n\nThat’s huge! Grizzly bears are one of the largest land animals alive today. But as we can see in this footage, they look like teddy bears next to the gorgeous Alaskan moose. Female small-sized moose can weigh up to 800 pounds. Males of this size can weigh up to 1,600 pounds and grow as tall as about 6 feet.\n\nIt’s not unheard of for a bear to attack a moose, but the teddies in this video know better. They have plenty of fish to snack on while letting the moose safely pass by. It’s also not uncommon for moose to kill bears.\n\nMoose have been known to gore bears with their antlers, trample them underfoot, or rake them with their hooves. Moose are not hostile creatures. However, they still pose a threat. They will protect themselves if threatened. Grizzlies and polar bears are often not killed by moose, but they can cause significant harm to wolves, black bears, and coyotes, which are smaller prey.\n\nMoose and bears have the capacity to be deadly to people, depending on the circumstances. However, because they are predators, whereas moose are not, bears tend to be more dangerous. If you ever find yourself in a situation like this one, be sure to keep a safe distance from any wild animal.\n\nYes, bears normally stay away from fully-grown moose. Moose have very large antlers, and they can easily tear a grizzly bear apart, so bears usually leave moose alone. If it came to a fight, a grizzly bear would probably win, but it would be a tough fight, and the bear is smart enough to avoid it. See our article about this situation: Moose vs Bear: Who Would Win in a Fight?\n\nHowever, bears are commonly known to attack moose calves below the age of two months, as they do not have full-grown antlers to defend themselves.\n\nDuring the spring season, when grizzly bears just come out of hibernation, they are known to ignore their own instincts and attack an isolated moose or two.\n\nMoose in the wild typically have a lifespan of about 10-20 years. Bears, on the other hand, can live for much longer and may even reach 30 years old in some cases. The main threats to their survival are human activities such as hunting and habitat destruction due to deforestation or urbanization.\n\nOther natural predators also pose risks, especially for young moose or bear cubs, which are more vulnerable to predation than adults. Both species must also contend with environmental factors, such as harsh winters that can lead to malnutrition and disease, which can shorten their lives if not properly managed.\n\nIt’s no wonder grizzlies hesitate to take on a full-grown moose – they are gigantic! The Alaskan Yukon moose, the largest subspecies, can grow to a massive 1,808 pounds, stand up to 7.7 feet tall, and sport antlers more than 80 inches across. The height of a moose is measured at the shoulder – so its hoof-to-antler height could easily reach 10 feet! East Siberian moose are only slightly smaller – tipping the scales at 1,600 pounds.\n\nMoose are the largest species of deer, with an average Yellowstone bull standing over 6 feet tall and weighing around 1,000 pounds. Females are slightly smaller and tend to weigh around 800. So, even when considering the average-sized moose and the average-sized 500-pound grizzly – it’s easy to see why the typically lazy bear would hold off on such a risky, demanding fight. Only the hungriest grizzly eating for hibernation would even consider such – much less act on it.\n\nThe post Alaskan Moose Tower Over Grizzlies In Rare Wilderness Footage appeared first on A-Z Animals.",

    "fullText": "To fast or not to fast? That is the question many people ask before a cholesterol test.\n\nPatients used to be routinely instructed not to eat for at least eight hours before the screening, and some doctors still recommend that practice.\n\nBut fasting before lipid test is unnecessary for most people since the impact on cholesterol numbers is usually “negligible,” according to the Harvard Medical School.\n\nDr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver, has stopped asking his patients to fast before a cholesterol test.\n\n“You want to see what your numbers look like when you're living every day, not in some artificial state,” he tells TODAY.com.\n\nBut there’s one type of food the cardiologist recommends avoiding before the blood test.\n\n“The truth is, the only real parameter on the lipid panel that changes drastically and quickly is triglycerides,” Freeman says.\n\n“So I'd recommend that you not eat sweets and treats before you go for your lipid panel to avoid that spike in triglycerides.”\n\nBesides sugary foods and beverages, triglycerides are also dependent on white carbs, fatty foods and alcohol so the cardiologist would also avoid those foods and drinks immediately before his lipid panel.\n\nTriglycerides are the most common type of fat in the body, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.\n\nSome are needed for good health, but high levels of triglycerides can raise the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nA healthy level of triglycerides is below 150 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) for adults.\n\nBut about a quarter of Americans have levels that are too high. Those patients should always fast before a cholesterol test to get a more accurate measure of their triglycerides, experts at the Harvard Medical School note. That’s also how Freeman approaches lipid testing in his office.\n\nOther than skipping sweets and treats, most people can eat what they normally eat the night before a cholesterol test, Freeman says.\n\n“If you decide to eat nothing but kale for two weeks prior to your lipid panel, your triglycerides will probably be really low, and maybe your LDL could be a little lower,” he notes.\n\n“(But) your goal is to try to catch what you're like in the wild, in the real world.”\n\nHopefully, that includes lots of heart-healthy foods.\n\nAlways check with your doctor to see if you need to fast before a cholesterol test.\n\nTODAY’s Expert Tip of the Day series is all about simple strategies to make life a little easier.

    "fullText": "In BBC Sport's new Eat & Yap series, Alex Scott meets some of the best Women's Super League players to share the food they love and grew up eating, and talk about life on and off the pitch.\n\nWatch the interview in full now on BBC iPlayer\n\nOlivia Smith will forever be the women's game's first seven-figure player.\n\nAged 15, she won her first senior Canada cap while playing college football in her homeland.\n\nAged 18, she signed her first professional contract with Portuguese club Sporting, announcing her arrival with a goal and an assist on her debut.\n\nAged 19, she moved to the Women's Super League (WSL) to play for fallen giants Liverpool, starring on the right wing as the two-time champions avoided relegation back to the second tier.\n\nIn July 2025, European champions Arsenal broke the broke the world record to bring 20-year-old Smith to north London.\n\nIn the first episode of Eat & Yap the Arsenal and Canada superstar sat down with Alex Scott to tuck into some tasty dishes that reflect her life growing up in Canada and her Caribbean roots, while revealing her footballing idols, a love of Yorkshire puddings and much more.\n\nAlex Scott: So I was told I have to bring maple syrup.\n\nOlivia Smith: Yeah, you're a gem. Maple syrup. Lovely. First of all, I always have, for example, pancakes before a match. I just like pancakes and I always need to have maple syrup. Honestly, I eat this with everything.\n\nAlex: When was the last time you were actually at home in Canada?\n\nOlivia: Oh - probably in the summer, as I spent my Christmas here.\n\nAlex: What do you think of home? Can you build a picture for me of what life was like for you growing up back home?\n\nOlivia: I have a younger sister, so we grew up together. My family were all kind of goofballs I would say. So just playing games a lot, we're always outside, we have dogs as well. So I've grown up with dogs and just go to the park, play football, play with the dogs. That's kind of like what a typical day would look like.\n\nAlex: So your sister plays football?\n\nAlex: What position does she play?\n\nOlivia: Midfielder, winger, striker.\n\nAlex: So does she look up to you and want to follow in your footsteps?\n\nOlivia: I hope so, but she claims she's better than me!\n\nAlex: Does she literally watch your games and say \"You should have been doing this\" or \"You should have scored that goal\"?\n\nOlivia: Yes - she sends me snapchats of my game and says \"Why did you do that?\" I'm like, well, \"What would you have done?\"\n\nAlex: What did she think when you made your move to Arsenal?\n\nOlivia: She was so excited. I mean she also looks up to a team like Arsenal, she loves watching me play so then for me to get the opportunity and really be a role model for her playing with girls like Alessia [Russo] and Leah [Williamson], it's amazing. She's really excited for me.\n\nAlex: Who do you look up to back in Canada?\n\nOlivia: Christine Sinclair. She's a huge legend in the game of course, and also Marta. Then I love watching the men's game as well, so I was always looking up to Neymar, Ronaldinho, Messi, players like that.\n\nAlex: What did your family make of you playing football?\n\nOlivia: I think my dad really grew me into football and he kind of paved the way for me. He made so many sacrifices for me to be where I am today. I also wanted it and he could see that.\n\nAlex: How would your family and friends describe you?\n\nOlivia: Oh, ambitious, crazy... just attacking-minded. My dad always described me whenever I'd play as I'd just take the ball off my own team-mates to go score a goal!\n\nAlex: What was it like for you to make that transition when you finally moved away from Canada playing football?\n\nOlivia: It was quite tough, although I had been away from home for a bit before that. But going to Portugal, for example, it's a whole new world. Different language, different style of football. So having to learn that really on my own was quite tough. But the support system that I had around me was great, so I was able to adapt, I'd say, quite quickly, which is nice.\n\nAnd then, obviously, coming over to England, then that's a whole other environment, style of play, different kinds of people. And obviously it just takes a little bit [of time] to get comfortable. Once you make friends and you're happy, it makes a world of difference on the pitch and off the pitch.\n\nAlex: What would you say is the biggest thing you've learned about yourself?\n\nOlivia: I would say I always thought I was quite independent, but coming here and my ability to make relationships with people on my team and outside of football as well, it has really helped me to acclimatise to what life is like here.\n\nAlex: So we need to explain your background. The Jamaican food - your dad - Jamaican roots, right? And I learned your mum has Chilean and Peruvian roots. What was dinner like at home?\n\nOlivia: Dinner looks different pretty much every day and especially when my grandparents would come by to cook. That's when you know it's on top. So we'd have jerk chicken and my grandpa would make oxtail and my grandmother would make something called seco.\n\nOlivia: It's like a [Peruvian] meat stew and rice, and it's in a green sauce - it's really nice.\n\nAlex: And your grandads played football?\n\nAlex: So when they come round, were there football matches? Were you watching them?\n\nOlivia: I was always playing with them when we went on vacation to the Dominican - we always found a pitch and then we would play pick-up games with random people. My grandparents would join, I would join, my dad and my sister - it was always fun.\n\nAlex: What's your typical day off looking like?\n\nOlivia: It depends on the day and how I feel, but I do pretty much like to stay at home. I like to watch movies, binge watch, I also play video games as well. So, yeah, games, probably a little bit of shopping because I love to shop.\n\nAlex: Right. So if you're not playing football, you are..?\n\nAlex: If one song could be playing when you score a goal, what would it be?\n\nOlivia: I'm going to go with A Milli [by Lil Wayne] because I have that on my pre-match playlists. I think every game.\n\nAlex: The last thing you wrote in your phone notes was?\n\nOlivia: Oh. A bunch of numbers. I was playing an escape room game, so I needed to write down all these numbers so I could put it into a code.\n\nAlex: Since moving to England, what's one thing that you're just like \"I absolutely love this\"?\n\nOlivia: I fell in love with Yorkshire puddings and a Sunday dinner. It's my favourite thing - I absolutely love them now.\n\nAlex: Not many people love Yorkshire puddings.\n\nOlivia: Well, initially I wasn't sure. I was very hesitant because I had in my mind, like gravy on bread. And when I tried it for the first time I thought - how do you even describe Yorkshire puddings?\n\nAlex: Let's think about when we're looking ahead to the season, what are your goals and ambitions?\n\nOlivia: Ultimately, I want to become a better version of myself as a player. I know there's a lot of things I need to develop on, and being at Arsenal that will definitely help me. And ultimately I want to win things.\n\nAlex: Do you feel that you've settled in and the reasons that made you want to come to the club are starting to open up to you?\n\nOlivia: Yeah, 100%. I think the first couple of months it was a lot to really take in, but the girls have been amazing making me feel comfortable.\n\nAlex: Talk me through that first day when you arrived at Arsenal.\n\nOlivia: I was absolutely terrified, yeah, because every time we played Arsenal it was just a massive game. Obviously you never know what the environment is like from the outside, and I didn't know what to expect. And walking in, it was the complete opposite of what I thought it would be - everyone was just so welcoming.\n\nAlex: Who's the MVP, the person that if they weren't there tomorrow you'd be thinking \"this feels strange\"?\n\nOlivia: Less [Russo] really. She just has that personality and that vibe that you can feel at the training ground. It's just very comfortable and you can speak to her about anything. She's just very sweet.\n\nAlex: Renee [Slegers] has just signed a new three-year contract. In terms of the other managers that you've played for, how is she different?\n\nOlivia: She's just very ambitious and I feel like that goes for all around the club. Her values match [the club] and match the players as well, so I think that's just a really great thing to have, and also stability - knowing that she's going to be here for the next three years. To have a female empower us - I think that's her big thing as well, that she wants the players to feel empowered and use our voices - which every time that I've spoken to her I'm like, yeah, that's impressive.\n\nAlex: Do you know about my history with Renee? I used to be her teacher when she first came over. I was a teacher at the Arsenal Academy at the time so it's kind of full circle to see her go on to manage the team. She knows what being at the club means for everyone.\n\nAlex: Talking of the next thing, when you're looking at you and your career, what is it that you want to tick off? What do you want to achieve?\n\nOlivia: Oh, there's plenty of things I want to achieve. I want to win everything, ultimately. And again, the biggest thing is I just want to keep developing and growing as a person and a player. I think that's really important to me, just continue to develop my character, meeting more people and just learning.\n\nAlex: You said meeting more people. How have the Arsenal fans embraced you?\n\nOlivia: They've been amazing. I attended the [Arsenal Women fan engagement project] Block by Block, external consultation a couple of weeks ago where we discussed how we can make matchdays better.\n\nIt was really fun because I got to interact with the fans more on a personal level rather than them being up in the stands and just clapping - actually having a conversation and seeing what we can do to make the experience better for them, but also for us as players. Whether that's music, fireworks, just making it more fun.\n\nAlex: I bet the fans must have been buzzing. Did they know that you were turning up?\n\nOlivia: I'm actually not sure, but they seemed quite shocked when I pulled up!\n\nWatch: Arsenal v Chelsea in the Women's Super League on Saturday, 24 June (12:30 GMT) on BBC One and BBC iPlayer\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "For decades, McDonald's customers have complained that the fast-food giant reserves its most fun and innovative menu items for international markets, leaving its home country with the same predictable seasonal releases.\n\nAs frustrating as that may seem, there is a deliberate strategy behind this madness.\n\nMcDonald's tailors its menu in each country based on cultural preferences, ingredient availability, and what can be executed efficiently at scale. The same applies to limited-time and seasonal items.\n\nWhile menus vary around the world, a small set of core products remains consistent, including the World Famous Fries, the classic Hamburger and Cheeseburger, the Big Mac, McNuggets, and the Vanilla Cone.\n\nThis localization strategy reduces operational risk and improves return on investment, which is why each country maintains its own lineup with exclusive offerings.\n\nHistorically, McDonald's has taken a cautious approach to bringing international items to the U.S., testing them selectively and tailoring availability based on regional preferences and past performance. In most cases, localized items had stayed local.\n\nMcDonald's has revealed an entire lineup of international menu items coming to U.S. restaurants nationwide in 2026, marking one of the company's most ambitious cross-market rollouts in years.\n\nHere is the full list, with all items set to launch within the next few days.\n\nMcDonald's (MCD) first introduced its Hot Honey Sauce in Australia in March 2025, aiming to capitalize on what it described as \"the hottest trend everyone is talking about,\" according to a company press release. The sauce was later rolled out in New Zealand and Canada, each for a limited-time run.\n\nNow, less than a year later, it is headed to the U.S.\n\nThe Hot Honey Sauce blends honey with red bell peppers and cayenne peppers, finished with a hint of tangy vinegar. Alongside it, McDonald's is debuting three new menu items featuring the trendy sauce.\n\nHot Honey Bacon McCrispy: A crispy chicken filet topped with thick-cut applewood smoked bacon, crispy jalapeños, shredded lettuce, creamy mayo, and Hot Honey Sauce, served on a toasted potato roll \n\nHot Honey Snack Wrap: A McCrispy Strip topped with shredded cheese, shredded lettuce, and Hot Honey Sauce, all wrapped in a tortilla \n\nHot Honey Sausage Egg Biscuit: A pork sausage patty and a folded egg, topped with Hot Honey Sauce, on a biscuit brushed with real butter \n\nThe Hot Honey Sauce and all three new menu items will be available for a limited time beginning January 27 at participating U.S. locations and can be added to any menu item, according to the Snackolator Instagram page.\n\nAlthough the new products have not officially launched, they already appear on the McDonald's website.\n\nThe Big Arch burger debuted in Portugal in July 2024 and quickly gained traction, prompting McDonald's to expand it into Canada, Germany, Australia, the UK, Ireland, and France.\n\nDuring an earnings call in mid-2024, McDonald's acknowledged the burger's strong performance and universal appeal, which led it to accelerate its expansion.\n\n\"The pilot of our larger burger offering, Big Arch, now in three international markets, Portugal, Germany, and Canada, shows that we're listening to consumer tastes and delivering,\" said McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski in the earnings call.\n\n\"We'll work with franchisees and partners to deploy the Big Arch faster into more international markets in 2025.\"\n\nFollowing its positive reception abroad, McDonald's tested the Big Arch in the U.S. at its headquarters restaurant in Chicago for a limited time.\n\nThis massive burger features two quarter-pounder patties, three slices of white cheese, crispy onions, slivered onions, pickles, lettuce, and Big Arch Sauce, all sandwiched between a sliced sesame and poppy seed bun.\n\nWhile the Double Quarter Pounder comes close, it's not the same. McDonald's is positioning the Big Arch as a more premium, value-driven option.\n\nIn Canada, a Big Arch meal costs about $12.59, or roughly $9 in the U.S. Despite the higher price, the company says the burger delivers greater value, an increasingly important selling point as consumers grow more cautious of their spending.\n\nMcDonald's credits the Big Arch as a key traffic driver in several markets, helping boost global comparable sales by nearly 4% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nAfter extensive testing, the Big Arch will make its nationwide U.S. debut in early March 2026, according to The Street.\n\nLike much of the fast-food industry, McDonald's has faced mounting pressure in recent years, particularly in the U.S. Slower foot traffic, rising food costs, and weaker spending have weighed on results.\n\nPrices for food at home increased 2.6%, while prices for food away from home rose 3.7% in the 12 months ended September 2025, according to recent U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n\nMcDonald's making major drive-thru change\n\nMcDonald’s expected to bring back beloved childhood favorite in 2026\n\nFive Guys debuts alcohol and all-day breakfast\n\nDuring the quarter ending June 2025, foodservice traffic declined 1%, as consumers dined out less frequently, according to Circana. However, value menu traffic rose 1%, marking the first positive growth in three years.\n\nCircana also found that value-focused diners are 33% more likely than non-value buyers to purchase value menu items when visiting other restaurant chains, underscoring how aggressively consumers are hunting for savings and deals.\n\nIn response to consumers' cautious spending, McDonald's has rolled out several value-focused initiatives, including the Extra Value Meals, McValue menu, and $5 Meal Deals.\n\nIn March 2025, the company launched the Restaurant Experience Team, combining operations, supply chain, franchising, development, restaurant design, delivery, and Speedee Labs to drive innovation and efficiency. It also created three new global Category Management teams focused on beef, chicken, and beverages/desserts to further specialize innovation within its food products.\n\n“Value is rarely defined only by price,” said Circana Senior VP and Industry Advisor for Food and Foodservice David Portalatin in a statement. “Operational excellence in providing quality, affordability, great experiences, and convenience is what leads winning restaurants and their supply chain partners to greater success.”\n\nThose efforts are beginning to pay off. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, U.S. comparable sales increased 2.4%.\n\nDespite improvement, McDonald's remains cautious.\n\n\"We continue to remain cautious about the health of the consumer in the U.S. and our top international markets and believe the pressures will continue well into 2026,\" said McDonald's CEO Christopher J. Kempczinski in an earnings call.\n\n\"It’s a foundational expectation of our brand to bring consumers through our doors and keep them coming back.\"",

    "title": "The Indian couple who won a $200,000 settlement over 'food racism' at US university",
    "description": "The dispute began after the couple defended their right to heat palak paneer in a campus microwave.",
    "fullText": "A dispute that began over heating a dish in a microwave has ended with two Indian students winning a $200,000 settlement from a US university.\n\nAditya Prakash and his fiancee, Urmi Bhattacheryya, told the BBC they filed a civil rights lawsuit against the University of Colorado, Boulder, after they faced a series of \"microaggressions and retaliatory actions\" following the microwave incident.\n\nThe harassment began, the lawsuit alleged, after a university staff member objected to Prakash heating up his lunch of palak paneer - one of northern India's most popular dishes, made of pureed spinach and paneer (considered an Indian equivalent of cottage cheese) - in a microwave on campus, because of the way it smelled.\n\nIn response to the BBC's questions, the university said it could not comment on the \"specific circumstances\" surrounding the students' claims of discrimination and harassment due to privacy laws, but added it was \"committed to fostering an inclusive environment for all students, faculty and staff regardless of national origin, religion, culture and other classes protected under US laws and by university policies\".\n\n\"When these allegations arose in 2023, we took them seriously and adhered to established, robust processes to address them, as we do with all claims of discrimination and harassment. We reached an agreement with the students in September [2025] and deny any liability in this case,\" the university said.\n\nPrakash said for them, the point of the lawsuit was not the money. \"It was about making a point - that there are consequences to discriminating against Indians for their 'Indianness'.\"\n\nThe lawsuit has received significant media coverage in India since it was first reported last week, starting a conversation around what many have described as \"food racism\" in Western countries. Many Indians on social media have shared their own experiences of facing ridicule over their food habits abroad.\n\nSome have also pointed out that discrimination over food is rampant in India as well, where non-vegetarian food is banned in many schools and colleges over perceptions of it being impure or dirty. People from disadvantaged castes and north-eastern states often face bias over their food habits, with some complaining about the smell of the ingredients they use.\n\nAnd it's not just Indian or South Asian food - communities from Africa, Latin America and other parts of Asia have also shared their experiences of being shamed over their food habits.\n\nPrakash and Bhattacheryya claim their ordeal began in September 2023. Prakash, a PhD student in the Anthropology Department at the university, was microwaving his lunch of palak paneer when a British staff member allegedly remarked that his food was giving off a \"pungent\" odour and told him that there was a rule against heating foods with strong odours in that microwave.\n\nPrakash said the rule wasn't mentioned anywhere and when he later inquired about which foods were considered pungent, he was told that sandwiches were not, while curry was.\n\nPrakash alleged that the exchange was followed by a series of actions by the university which led to him and Bhattacheryya - who was also a PhD student there - losing their research funding, teaching roles and even the PhD advisers they had worked with for months.\n\nIn May 2025, Prakash and Bhattacheryya filed a lawsuit against the university, alleging discriminatory treatment and a \"pattern of escalating retaliation\" against them.\n\nIn September, the university settled the lawsuit. Such settlements are usually arrived at to avoid lengthy and expensive court battles for both parties.\n\nAccording to the terms of the settlement, the university agreed to give the students their degrees but denied all liabilities and banned them from studying or working there in future.\n\n'Indian food is terrible' tweet sparks hot debate\n\nIn its statement shared with the BBC, the university added: \"CU Boulder's Anthropology Department has worked to rebuild trust among students, faculty and staff. Among other efforts, department leaders met with graduate students, faculty and staff to listen and discuss changes that best support the department's efforts to foster an inclusive and supportive environment for all.\"\n\n\"Individuals who are determined to be responsible for violating university policies preventing discrimination and harassment are held accountable,\" it added.\n\nPrakash says that this isn't his first brush with discrimination over food.\n\nWhen he was growing up in Italy, his school teachers would often ask him to sit at a separate table during lunch breaks because his classmates found the smell of his food \"off-putting\", he says.\n\n\"Acts like isolating me from my European classmates or stopping me from using a shared microwave because of how my food smells are how white people control your Indianness and shrink the spaces you can exist in,\" he says.\n\nHe adds that there is a long history of food being used to put down Indian and other ethnic groups.\n\n\"The word 'curry' has been conflated with the 'smell' of marginalised communities who toil in kitchens and peoples' homes and has been turned into a pejorative term for 'Indian',\" he says.\n\nBhattacheryya says that even someone like former Vice-President Kamala Harris isn't immune to being insulted over food.\n\nShe points to a 2024 social media post by far-right activist Laura Loomer saying that if Harris became president, the White House \"will smell like curry\". Loomer has denied being racist.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Bhattacheryya also alleged she faced retaliation after she invited Prakash to speak as a guest lecturer on the topic of cultural relativism in her anthropology class. Cultural relativism is the view that no culture is superior or inferior to another as cultural practices of all groups exist within their own cultural context.\n\nDuring the lecture, Prakash says he shared several examples of food racism he had encountered, including the palak paneer incident, without naming anyone.\n\nBhattacheryya says that she also faced racist abuse when she posted a thread on X about the \"systemic racism\" she and Prakash were facing at the university in 2024.\n\nBelow the post, there are several comments supporting the couple but also ones that said, \"go back to India\", \"decolonisation was a mistake\" and \"it's not just the food, many of you don't bathe and we know\".\n\nPrakash and Bhattacheryya said what they wanted from the university was to be heard and understood; for their hurt and pain at being \"othered\" to be acknowledged and for amends to be made in a meaningful way.\n\nThey claim that they never received a meaningful apology from the university. The university did not respond to the BBC's question about this.\n\nThey have since returned to India and say that they might never go back to the US.\n\n\"No matter how good you are at what you do, the system is constantly telling you that because of your skin colour or your nationality, you can be sent back any time. The precarity is acute and our experience at the university is a good example of this,\" Prakash says.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "description": "Dolly Parton isn't just a legendary musician and fashion icon — she's also a great chef. Her delicious cornbread recipe is ready in just 30 minutes.",
    "fullText": "On top of being a legendary musician and fashion icon, Dolly Parton is also a great chef.\n\nThe country-music star has shared plenty of her cooking secrets with me, including her hack for making the fluffiest scrambled eggs and the unique ingredient she uses to elevate her mac and cheese.\n\nParton also revealed what she loves whipping up in the kitchen for her goddaughter, Miley Cyrus.\n\n\"Miley and I both love Southern food like mashed potatoes, coleslaw, and a big ol' hunk of cornbread — making cornbread muffins or a big pan of it with the squares,\" Parton told me.\n\nI loved trying Parton's Taco Bell order. So when I stumbled on her cornbread recipe, I knew I had to give it a go.\n\nInstead of cooking full bacon strips, I cut the bacon into small pieces and spread them out in my 9-inch skillet so they would render evenly.\n\nI cooked my bacon over medium-low heat until it turned crispy and I could see plenty of drippings at the bottom of the pan. Then, I removed the pieces, letting them rest on a plate lined with a paper towel. Parton said the skillet should be covered with extra bacon drippings, so I didn't wipe it clean after I finished cooking.\n\nYou could easily whip up Parton's recipe after you've made breakfast, or save the bacon to eat alongside her cornbread. Either way, it's a win-win.\n\nFirst, I added two cups of the self-rising cornmeal to a large bowl.\n\nThe first recipe I found online actually called for two tablespoons of bacon drippings instead of two teaspoons. I didn't realize Parton's recipe was different before I made the cornbread again, so I accidentally added extra.\n\nThe flavor still came out great, so feel free to add more bacon drippings if you wish.\n\nParton recommends gradually adding the buttermilk while stirring everything with a wooden spoon. You'll know the batter is ready when it's thick but smooth.\n\nBarely 10 minutes of prep had passed, and my cornbread was ready to go into the oven.\n\nI threw my skillet into the oven at 425 degrees Fahrenheit and let it cook for 25 minutes. Parton says you'll know the cornbread is ready if it springs back when you tap it.",

    "fullText": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Warren Buffett's successor appears to be considering his first significant move after taking over as CEO this month.\n\nKraft Heinz warned investors Tuesday that Berkshire Hathaway may be interested in selling its 325 million shares in the name brand food giant that Buffett helped create back in 2015. The news came in a filing with stock market regulators.\n\nBuffett and the Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital orchestrated the merger of Kraft and Heinz back then because they already owned Heinz and believed in the power of their brands. Now Greg Abel may be plotting a different course.\n\nOver the years since Buffett had come to realize that the company's competitive moat around its brands wasn't as strong as he thought as consumers have increasingly been willing to switch to store brands and move away from processed foods. Berkshire took a $3.76 billion writedown on its Kraft-Heinz stake last summer. Buffett said last fall that he was disappointed in Kraft Heinz' plan to split the company in two, and Berkshire's two representatives resigned from the Kraft board last spring.\n\nBut still it was rare for Buffett to unload an acquisition during his six decades leading Berkshire even when he soured on a business' prospects. Berkshire didn't respond to questions Tuesday about the filing where Kraft Heinz disclosed that its largest shareholder “may offer to sell, from time to time, 325,442,152 shares.” Kraft Heinz shares fell nearly 4% to $22.85 after the announcement.\n\nThere's no sign Berkshire has started selling yet, but CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert wonders if this could be just the beginning of a comprehensive review of Berkshire's varied holdings. In addition to its massive stock portfolio worth over $300 billion, Berkshire owns an assortment of insurers including Geico, several utilities, BNSF railroad and an eclectic mix of manufacturing and retail companies.\n\n“My sense is that Greg Abel’s leadership style may be a departure from Buffett’s, and this sale, if completed, would represent a shift in corporate mindset,” Seifert said. \"Berkshire under Buffett typically only made acquisitions- not divestitures. It's not inconceivable, in our view, that Abel may likely assess every Berkshire subsidiary and decide to jettison those that do not meet his internal hurdles.“\n\nOf course Abel already knows many of Berkshire's companies well because he has been managing all of the non-insurance companies since 2018. But he only became CEO on Jan. 1. Buffett remains chairman, but investors are watching closely for any changes Abel might make at the venerable conglomerate.",

    "fullText": "Coca-Cola's CEO said the drinks company is looking at one viral health trend this year.\n\nSpeaking with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, CEO James Quincey said fiber might be the next big thing for Coca-Cola.\n\n\"So you've got a lot of focus on refreshment and a lot of focus on protein, and people are definitely seeing more protein,\" Quincey said. \"We might see fiber creep in this year.\"\n\nHe said fiber can be put into anything because it's soluble in beverages. He gave the example of the Diet Coke Fiber+ drink from Coca-Cola, which has been available in Japan since 2017.\n\nThe drink is advertised as sugar- and calorie-free, with five grams of dietary fiber per bottle.\n\nThe drink was part of a \"fast-growing segment where ingredients are added to beverages to address specific dietary needs,\" Quincey said in 2017.\n\nHowever, he said on Tuesday's Squawk Box that Diet Coke Fiber+ was still a \"niche\" drink, because \"people don't buy drinks to have their fiber.\"\n\nQuincey's comments echo those of other food and beverage executives who have predicted the rise of fiber this year.\n\nMcDonald's CEO, Chris Kempczinski, took to Instagram last week to predict his top three food trends for 2026, and the first item on the list was fiber. He said fiber was \"going to be big\" this year.\n\nPepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta predicted in an October earnings call that \"fiber will be the next protein.\"\n\nThe term \"fibermaxxing\" was a viral health trend on social media in 2025, with dieticians saying that it helps aid gut health, lower cholesterol, and reduce the risk of colon cancer.\n\nAnd cabbage, a fiber-rich vegetable, is having its moment on social media, with Pinterest predicting that the vegetable would trend highest on social media in the US in 2026.\n\nPinterest released its annual trends report in December, which showed that the search term \"cabbage dumplings\" rose 110% from September 2024 to August 2025, compared to the same period the year before.",

    "description": "He isn't known for having the most refined palate, so it's no surprise that President Donald Trump eats this instead of the fancy food at state dinners.",
    "fullText": "A White House insider shared the go-to meal that President Donald Trump likes to fill up on before attending formal engagements with esteemed guests, and to absolutely no one's surprise, it's a burger. In an episode of the Daily Beast's show \"Inside Trump's Head,\" journalist Michael Wolff said the president eats a burger meal prior to attending state dinners. He reportedly pokes at the fancy food he's routinely served on the job, using the strategy of talking constantly to distract other attendees from noticing that he's barely eating.\n\nTrump has a well-documented love affair with fast food, dating back to his first term when he served a spread of burgers and pizza to the Clemson University football team after they won the college national championship. He favored fast food on the campaign trail for his second term, even stopping to pose for a now-famous photo op with McDonald's fries in hand. Trump has reportedly reasoned that eating fast food makes him relatable to average Americans.\n\nThe president's association with fast food earns him both praise and criticism. With his long history of showmanship, some observers, such as the users on Reddit's r/Pics, have even questioned whether his preferences are authentic or endorsed. But as Wolff confirmed, Trump's love for burgers is the real thing — even behind closed doors.\n\nFurther into the episode of \"In Trump's Head,\" Wolff reveals that staff traveling with Trump aboard Air Force One are given care packages of fast food as perks of the job. Apparently, most staff members don't eat the White House food, which Wolff describes as being bland and mass produced in banquet fashion — similar to something served at a wedding. When host Joanna Coles read through a menu of courses served at a 2018 state dinner in honor of French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron, Wolff replied that Trump would not have touched any of it.\n\nWhile it's not uncommon for what President Trump eats in a typical day to end up in the news or even his personal social media, perhaps lesser known is the fact that former presidents and their inner circles also favored burgers and fries. Fast food appears to have been woven into the culture in Washington for decades. Our list of other politicians who are obsessed with fast food includes Bill Clinton, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Ted Cruz, and others. Most figures on our list are noted to blur the lines between business and pleasure when it comes to their love of fast food, similar to the way Trump does.\n\nFor more food and drink goodness, Get taste tests, food & drink news, deals from your favorite chains, recipes, cooking tips, and more!",

    "fullText": "In my opinion, fried chicken tenders are as American as apple pie.\n\nHowever, every fast-food restaurant has its own take on the classic staple, so I decided to visit three chains — Zaxby's, PDQ, and Chick-fil-A — to see how their offerings compared.\n\nHere's what I thought of the chicken tenders at each spot.\n\nTo kick things off, I stopped by my local Chick-fil-A. The brand, which first opened in Atlanta in 1967, now has more than 3,000 locations across the US, Puerto Rico, and Canada.\n\nWhen I stepped inside, I ordered the three-count chicken strips, which cost me $5.45.\n\nI enjoyed the Chick-Fil-A chicken tenders because they were crispy and had the right amount of seasoning.\n\nThey were also reasonably priced for such a decent portion size.\n\nAfter visiting Chick-Fil-A, I traveled to a nearby to PDQ, a chain restaurant known for its chicken tenders, salads, and sandwiches.\n\nThe first PDQ opened in Tampa in 2011, and the chain now has 42 locations, most of which are in Florida. However, there are also a few restaurants in North Carolina and New Jersey.\n\nHere, I ordered three crispy chicken tenders for $7.\n\nThe PDQ tenders were tasty, and they appeared to be a little larger than the ones I got from Chick-fil-A.\n\nWhen I bit into one, the inside was so tender it fell apart. Although this made them a little harder to eat, I was impressed by how fresh they seemed.\n\nI also thought they were seasoned nicely.\n\nFinally, I visited Zaxby's, a fast-food chain that specializes in chicken fingers and wings. Founded in 1990 in Statesboro, GA, the chain now has more than 900 locations, mostly in the South and Midwest.\n\nTo get the most for my money, the cashier suggested I order a kid's meal, which came with two chicken tenders, fries, a rice krispie treat, and a drink for $5.70.\n\nWhen I took a bite, I thought these chicken tenders tasted salty. This made sense because after looking at each restaurant's nutrition information online, it seemed as though the Zaxby's chicken contained the most sodium.\n\nDespite that, though, they were pretty flavorful. Although they appeared to have less seasoning on them than the ones I got at PDQ, I still tasted a hint of pepper. They were cooked perfectly too, and very tender.\n\nHowever, because of the salty flavor, these tenders were my least favorite of the three I tried.\n\nWhen it comes to plain, crispy, fried chicken tenders, Chick-fil-A was the clear winner. These had the right amount of seasoning, were reasonably priced, and came in the perfect portion size.\n\nI can definitely see myself returning to Chick-fil-A for \n\nThis story was originally published on April 17, 2025, and most recently updated on January 20, 2026.",

    "description": "Olympic swimmer Katie Ledecky generally follows a whole food diet, focusing on homemade dinners and veggie omelets.",
    "fullText": "For being the most decorated female swimmer in Olympic history, Katie Ledecky's philosophy around nutrition is surprisingly relaxed.\n\nFor one, she doesn't strictly track her daily protein intake. \"Over the years, I've kind of learned what I need because it does sometimes change, if I'm doing well or if I don't feel like I'm doing well,\" Ledecky, 28, told Business Insider.\n\nSince graduating from Stanford in 2020, her class-free schedule also gives her more time to rest and cook her own meals between her two blocks of daily training sessions. To keep things simple, she eats mostly the same breakfasts every day and usually has leftovers from the previous night's dinner for lunch.\n\n\"I just focus on things that I can prep easily,\" Ledecky said. \"My morning is pretty much set. I don't even have to think about it very much.\"\n\nLedecky shared what she typically eats in a day to fuel for and recover from long training sessions.\n\nLedecky typically wakes up at 5:00 a.m. for her first practice of the day, a 6 to 8 a.m. block involving swimming and strength training.\n\nBefore she heads out, she eats \"something quick and not anything too heavy,\" usually an oatmeal packet and a banana. The carbohydrates from both provide an energy boost.\n\nRight after practice, Ledecky usually has a Core Power protein shake, for whom she's a brand ambassador for, to tide her over until she gets home for breakfast.\n\n\"I try to get a full meal in within an hour of when I finish practice,\" she said, as the body is best optimized for nutrient intake after a hard workout. \"That was something I learned from a young age.\"\n\nBreakfast is usually two eggs, scrambled or cooked in an omelet. Ledecky, who is partnered with the egg brand Eggland's Best, said she grew up eating Eggland's eggs in particular since she was a kid, continuing to include them as a staple of her diet as an adult.\n\nShe loves making a vegetable omelet because of how easy it is to add extra fiber-rich ingredients like spinach, arugula, or tomatoes. She usually tops with cheese like mozzarella or cheddar.\n\nShe always adds a side of toast and fruit. \"So I'm kind of getting a good balance there of protein and carbs and everything that I need,\" she said.\n\nLedecky has a late lunch or larger snack before her second practice of the day, another two-hour training block in the afternoon.\n\n\"Usually, that's leftovers from dinner the night before, or a salad, or some chicken,\" she said.\n\nThroughout the day, she also likes to snack on berries, which offer fiber and extra nutrients.\n\n\"I love blueberries, raspberries, strawberries,\" she said. \"I always feel good when I'm having a mix of fruit throughout the day as well in between all my meals.\"\n\nAfter practice, Ledecky makes dinner — her most involved meal-prep of the day. She focuses on protein-rich meals, which help with building muscle and recovery.\n\n\"That's kind of when I mix up a little bit more,\" she said. \"Might be steak, might be chicken, might be a hamburger, might be pasta.\"\n\nLedecky has a few favorite desserts in rotation.\n\nShe keeps frozen yogurt and ice cream in her freezer whenever she wants a scoop at night. Sometimes, she goes to her favorite bakery in Florida for a pastry.\n\n\"I treat myself every now and then,\" she said. \"It just kind of depends on what I'm craving.\"",

    "description": "Ina Garten has dozens of delicious soup recipes. Her tomato soup with grilled cheese croutons is super easy to make and perfect for any age.",
    "fullText": "After cooking my way through Ina Garten's comforting pastas, energizing breakfasts, and delectable desserts, it was time for a new challenge.\n\nAs George Costanza would say, I was ready to \"shift into soup mode.\"\n\nGarten has dozens of soup recipes, and I've been slowly making my way through her repertoire. Each soup in this ranking is delicious — what else would you expect from the Barefoot Contessa? — but I definitely have some clear favorites.\n\nGarten's minestrone soup appears in her 2012 cookbook \"Foolproof.\" In the recipe's description, she calls it an \"incredibly hearty winter soup\" that \"falls somewhere between a soup and a stew.\"\n\nThe soup is packed with tons of vegetables — baby spinach, butternut squash, celery, carrots, garlic, and onion — plus cannellini beans, pancetta, pesto, Parmesan, and fresh thyme.\n\nIt requires a lot of chopping and prep, but all those veggies provide plenty of heft.\n\nFull transparency, if I had to rank my favorite soups in the world, minestrone would always be at the bottom of the list. Most minestrone soups I've tried have been lackluster and forgettable, but Garten's version is a commendable effort.\n\nThe chopped tomatoes and pancetta bring some richness to the broth, while the rainbow of veggies provides plenty of color and texture. I loved the pops of freshness from the spinach and thyme, and the salty kick from the Parmesan on top.\n\nWhile it's not my favorite Barefoot Contessa recipe, Garten's winter minestrone soup is healthy and hearty.\n\nHow to make Ina Garten's winter minestrone soup.\n\nGarten loves putting a new twist on classic recipes, and her Italian wedding soup is no different. Featured in Garten's 2008 cookbook \"Back to Basics,\" the recipe features meatballs made with a mixture of ground chicken and chicken sausage instead of the traditional beef or pork.\n\nThe recipe also includes small pasta — Garten recommends tubettini or stars — carrots, celery, fresh dill, baby spinach, and her homemade chicken stock.\n\nGarten says using homemade chicken stock \"makes all the difference in the world\" for this recipe, and I definitely agree.\n\nHer delicious stock infuses this dish with depth, giving the broth richness without making it heavy. This allows the soup to taste light and fresh, especially with the added burst of dill. The chicken meatballs were full of great flavor. I just wish I had made them a tad smaller!\n\nGarten's Italian wedding soup isn't as memorable as other recipes on this list, but it's a great dish for rainy nights.\n\nHow to make Ina Garten's Italian wedding soup.\n\nGarten made traditional chili for 20 years at the famous specialty food store that launched her cooking career (and gave her the iconic \"Barefoot Contessa\" nickname). But she decided to update the chili with chicken to make it lighter, which became even more popular than the original dish.\n\nThe soup — which is featured in Garten's 2001 cookbook \"Barefoot Contessa Parties!\" — features chicken breasts, red and yellow bell peppers, onion, garlic, fresh basil, plus toppings including green onions, sour cream, and grated cheddar cheese.\n\nWhen I'm craving chili, I usually whip up this recipe with ground beef that my fiancé and I have been making for years. But if you're looking for something a little lighter, Garten's recipe is a great substitute.\n\nThe tender and juicy roasted chicken pairs deliciously with the rich tomato flavor of the broth, and I enjoyed the crunchy texture from the bell peppers and the green onions on top. The sour cream also adds a nice hit of creaminess and acidity.\n\n\"This chili is reminiscent of a chicken tortilla soup, but it's so much heartier!\" my friend Kayla said after I made her a bowl. \"It makes you feel so warm and cozy.\"\n\nHow to make Ina Garten's chicken chili.\n\nGarten elevates her version of tomato soup — which also appears in \"Foolproof\" — with the addition of orzo, saffron threads, and grilled cheese croutons.\n\nThis is one of the quickest Barefoot Contessa soup recipes. There's very minimal prep, and the entire dish is ready in just 50 minutes!\n\nTomato and grilled cheese are a pairing as classic as peanut butter and jelly or macaroni and cheese, and turning the sandwich into bite-sized croutons is an inspired choice. I loved how they injected each sip of soup with a salty and satisfying blast of gooey cheesiness.\n\nI used Garten's homemade chicken stock for this recipe, which helps imbue the broth with so much flavor despite being on the stove for less than an hour. It's light and rich, with a silky texture I couldn't get enough of. This is the only tomato soup that I crave now.\n\nHow to make Ina Garten's tomato soup with grilled cheese croutons.\n\nAs you can see, Garten clearly loves to whip up Italian soup recipes. The Barefoot Contessa version of ravioli en brodo appears in \"Go-To Dinners,\" Garten's most recent cookbook.\n\nThe rustic recipe features homemade chicken stock, fresh or frozen cheese ravioli, carrots, celery, fennel, dill, lemon juice, and Parmesan cheese.\n\nGarten's ravioli en brodo turned me into a true homemade chicken stock convert. With its help, the broth in this soup truly tastes like liquid gold. It's light but silky, rich and savory. The dill and lemon add an extra burst of brightness, while the ravioli brings in that comforting cheesiness.\n\nI dream about this soup so much, I think it's safe to say I prefer it over chicken noodle. And now I make a huge pot of homemade chicken stock every winter.\n\nHow to make Ina Garten's ravioli en brodo.\n\nGarten was inspired to make a chicken pot pie soup after she spotted one on an airport menu.\n\n\"It was actually harder to make than it sounded — my first few attempts just tasted like chicken pot pie filling, not soup,\" she wrote in her 2020 cookbook \"Modern Comfort Food.\"\n\n\"This one, though, hit all the right comforting notes, with good chicken stock, roasted chicken, and puff pastry croutons,\" Garten added.\n\nThe soup also features carrots, leeks, fennel, garlic, pearl onions, peas, fresh tarragon and parsley, plus some cream sherry.\n\nI wish I knew which airport restaurant had the chicken pot pie soup on its menu so I could personally thank them for inspiring Garten's version, which has become one of my favorite comfort meals.\n\nThis recipe keeps the spirit of pot pie alive with deliciously juicy and tender chicken surrounded by fresh and flavorful veggies with every sip. The puff pastry croutons were an easy and quick addition, and they tasted incredible after soaking up the delicious broth.\n\nWhen one of my loved ones is sick, this is always the dish that I make for them. It's truly soup for the soul.\n\nHere's how to make Ina Garten's chicken pot pie soup.",

Few things test communication, adaptability, and friendship like trying to serve meals under pressure, while hot-headed customers or food inspectors breathe down your neck.\n\nThe games on this list turn simple mechanics into high-stakes teamwork, and push the limits of even the most laid-back friendships. Many of the games are perfect for players of all ages, those who are new to gaming, and people looking for a casual experience with friends. As long as you don't cry over split milk, you'll get a lot out of these culinary co-op classics.\n\nIf you like a co-op experience but can't stand to use the kitchen when someone else is in there (valid), check out our best couch co-op games list for similar vibes without the foodie flavour.\n\nOvercooked! All You Can Eat is often the first name that comes up when people talk about co-op cooking games, and for good reason. This collection brings together multiple Overcooked experiences into one package, focusing entirely on the cooperative chaos offered by the franchise. Players work together to prepare, cook, and serve dishes across a series of increasingly absurd kitchens, many of which actively interfere with your ability to function as a team, so pretty standard for the catering industry.\n\nIdeal for players who enjoy fast-paced action and don’t mind getting a little heated in the kitchen, Overcooked! All You Can Eat is especially well-suited for local co-op sessions, where you can embrace your inner Gordon Ramsay and get your point across in an instant. This edition also features an assist mode, where several accessibility options mean everyone can join in, whatever their chef-ing ability. Overcooked also made it onto our best Xbox co-op games list, and works flawlessly either locally or online.\n\nGameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom\n\nYou can probably guess the premise of One Armed Cook without much prompting: you're a cook and you have one arm. But the simple concept gives way to hours of physics-based fun when you consider that between you and a friend, you'll have all the required arms. The game very quickly goes from \"I'm not doing too badly, considering,\" to \"oh my god the floor is covered in onions,\" so if you want the video game equivalent of a three-legged race, you don't have to look much further.\n\nCarrying ingredients, chopping food, and assembling dishes often requires both of you working in sync, especially when dealing with awkward customers or a full house. One Armed Cook is best enjoyed by pals who appreciate goofy, unpredictable gameplay and don’t mind failing spectacularly on the way to success.\n\nPlateUp! blends the more traditional elements of co-op cooking with light restaurant management, meaning it's as much about planning ahead as it is about the actual execution of each dish. It's another of the more popular entries on the list, but continues to prove itself in the multiplayer arena, even against more recent games. Players work together to run a restaurant over 15 in-game days, choosing layouts, upgrading equipment, and deciding how to handle increasingly demanding customers. Every three days, you then have to choose a card that will permanently impact the game from there on--sometimes for the worse.\n\nUnlike more linear level-based cooking games, PlateUp! leans toward rogue-lite mechanics, changing things up with every full game. Decisions made early--such as kitchen layout or menu/card choices--directly affect later runs. Cooking, serving, cleaning, and managing customer flow all happen simultaneously, making teamwork essential and genuinely challenging.\n\nDiner Bros 2 asks a lot of you, so if you want a co-op cooking game with a bit of bite, this is the one for you. Alongside serving up delicious dishes, you'll have to keep enhancing your restaurant, optimizing its layout, impressing food critics, learning new recipes, hiring staff, and even dealing with sneaky customers who try to dine-n-dash. There are no gimmicks or environmental hazards, just good honest work and the potential of a thriving business driving you forward.\n\nThe game emphasizes clear task-division, meaning it's best with four friends, but can also be played alone (by hiring staff) or with two players. One player might focus on blasting through all the cooking while another handles serving and cleanup, but the most effective teams adjust roles dynamically depending on customer flow. Progression unlocks new content, encouraging players to improve efficiency and coordination over time, so you'll find plenty of replayability here, too.\n\nGalaxy Burger is a little different from many of the games on this list, as there's no frantic energy and no chaotic time limits. It's a laid-back game with no stress, where you and up to seven friends can create cosmic burgers for aliens, space creatures, and mecha cats. Different burgers require different ingredients and combinations, meaning you'll be prepping all manner of accompaniments, toppings, and side dishes to complete challenges.\n\nIf you're sick of cooking co-op games making you frustrated, stressed, or even downright angry, Galaxy Burger offers an alternative in chilled, casual cooking in which gentle creativity is rewarded. Galaxy Burger doesn’t reinvent the genre, but it adds enough thematic flair to keep teamwork feeling fresh. Plus, some of the cats are really cute.\n\nWitchtastic handles like a co-op cooking game, but throws in a witchy twist by having you and your pals brew potions instead of preparing food. Speed is the key, as you want those potions flying out of there ASAP. While there is a single-player campaign, it's a lot more fun to team up and scurry around increasingly elaborate cooking setups.\n\nIf you're a big fan of cozy games, Witchtastic might appeal with its cottagecore cauldron-in-a-forest vibes--just watch out for ghouls, wolves, and other halloween-y horrors that might distract you from your noble pursuit. Between foraging, scooting about on a broomstick, and customising your witch, there's always something to do between brewing sessions.\n\nCook Serve Delicious 3 is a lot to explain. It's a co-op cooking game set in dystopian future America where cyborgs mingle with humans--and instead of freaking out about this, you're taking your food truck on a road trip. If there is such a thing, this is basically the Dark Souls of cooking games, so if you want something that'll pose a genuine challenge to you and your friends (perhaps to knock a smug pal down a peg or two), you'll want to check the series out. It's one of those great two-player co-op games that'll reward you handsomely if you reach its incredibly high bar for challenge.\n\nSingle-player is supported in the campaign, but local co-op is where Cook Serve Delicious 3 really shines. Between rounds, you'll upgrade and customize your food truck, expand your menu, and travel across the war-torn future USA, before launching into another round of trying to cater to the hungry masses. When on-shift, you and your friends will have to coordinate almost seamlessly in an unforgiving onslaught of demanding customers. The game packs a ridiculous 387 levels, so you've got plenty of time to hone those chopping, flipping, and frying skills.\n\nLet’s Cook Together 2 is a wholesome co-op game that can be played with just about anyone, but works best with younger kids. The game rewards cooperative puzzle-solving and well-timed cooking collaboration, with kitchens designed as challenges that require players to coordinate movements, timing, and task execution to complete recipes efficiently. It's a great introduction to co-op gaming for your less-experienced kids or siblings, and offers more than 250 levels to try.\n\nFast reflexes aren't much of a consideration in Let's Cook Together 2's lower difficulty levels; you just need to be able to communicate, plan ahead, and support each other. Everything you need to serve up your dishes is scattered across a wide room, so sometimes you're going to have to throw stuff with perfect timing.\n\nShakes on a Plane centers on cooperative milkshake-making in unusual environments, but we'll loosely group milkshakes into cooking for now. Players work together to fulfill orders while dealing with airplane kitchens that move, tilt, or change unexpectedly, as they gain altitude and deal with turbulence, demanding passengers, and even aliens.\n\nThe game thrives on shared chaos, and although it does offer single-player, we personally think it's not the best way to play it. Having multiple players support you in co-op makes it easier and more engaging, allowing you to progress at a comfortable pace. At its heart it's a fairly cluttered Overcooked clone, but the unique concept and fun setting make it a good alternative party game if you're not afraid of heights.\n\nBone’s Cafe combines cooperative cooking with a creepy-cute aesthetic, tasking players with running a cafe filled with undead workers and patrons. Players work together to preparing dishes, serving customers, and managing shared responsibilities--as well as literally raising the dead.\n\nCoordination and timing are hugely important, with progression introducing new recipes and challenges that require better teamwork. Decorate and upgrade your cafe, and increase your Skull Ranking for better rewards, all while trying to automate and streamline your work. The cute pixel art belies the fact that your job is to strategically attract, kill, and harvest customers for fresh ingredients and use their souls to raise an undead army. Adorable.",

    "description": "Tommy Bahama's restaurant is popular for a business lunch. We ate there to see why — and left simultaneously underwhelmed and somewhat sold.",
    "fullText": "The Tommy Bahama on 45th Street and 5th Avenue bills itself on its website as \"an oasis in the big city,\" a \"refuge\" that's \"ideal for business lunches.\" Geographically, it makes total sense — on foot, Tommy Bahama is six minutes from JPMorgan's new tower, nine minutes from Bank of America Tower, five minutes from a PWC building, and 12 minutes from the main Morgan Stanley office.\n\nWe'll spare you the full list of adjacent corporate headquarters.\n\nWe had a 12:30 p.m. reservation, and the restaurant kept filling up throughout our meal. Diners eventually sat at the bar, and when I, Alice, went to the bathroom around 1:20 p.m., a gaggle of waiters was congregating by the kitchen, discussing table numbers over a window crammed with burgers and salads.\n\nApart from the kitchen, though, the crowded restaurant didn't feel cramped. Tables were far enough apart that we couldn't hear others' conversations, yet the background din of conversation made the room feel lively. The only deal talk we overheard came from a woman on her way out, who mentioned her interest in bringing ESRT, the company that owns the Empire State Building, on as a client.\n\nSo when it comes to layout, it's not a bad spot for a semi-private, relatively casual business lunch.\n\nFor a restaurant in Midtown Manhattan, the price point wasn't too surprising, but it seemed more suited to dinner than lunch. The cheapest item in the entrée section was $31.\n\nOne table of four almost entirely ordered the macadamia-nut-crusted fresh catch, and our waitress said the ahi tuna poke bowl was also a popular lunch choice. There were also a number of salad orders around the restaurant, which seemed fitting for lunch.\n\nThe $23 \"world-famous\" coconut shrimp appetizer arrived at our table fairly quickly — it was the only item we knew we had to try during our visit.\n\nThe shrimp sat atop a papaya and mango chutney, adding another layer of sweetness to the coconut coating. The cabbage salad that sat on top was our favorite part of the plate. The coleslaw was dressed with a light vinaigrette, and the cilantro added a nice freshness.\n\nUltimately, though, the overall dish was too sweet for our liking, and we left some lonely shrimp on the plate.\n\nI, Jordan, admit that I'm a newbie to ordering French dip sandwiches. I was expecting mine to come with caramelized onions and Swiss cheese. For $33, the Tommy Bahama wagyu French dip came with neither, despite the description listing sweet-and-sour onions as an ingredient.\n\nThe missing onions aside, I found myself taking some of the sliced beef off to make the sandwich a little easier to bite into. I felt kind of silly picking the valuable wagyu out of my sandwich, but I wanted to be able to close it properly. The broth was good for dipping, but I was left wanting more thinly sliced beef and additional ingredients.\n\nOur waitress surprised us with two free desserts: the piña colada cake and malted chocolate pie.\n\nThe cake was incredibly sweet, and we initially didn't realize it had any pineapple, but the whipped cream was, unsurprisingly, fantastic. Jordan said the chocolate pie was the only dish that tasted exactly as it looked. An Oreo crust is rarely a bad thing, but we agreed we wouldn't order it again.\n\nFor $145, we were sufficiently underwhelmed by the food. Then again, everyone else around us seemed pretty pleased, and the service is efficient without feeling rushed.\n\nAs a Wall Street go-to, Tommy Bahama presents a funny inverse. Many firms are setting up outposts in the south, namely in Texas, but the beachy restaurant is trying to bring southern, Floridian charm to 45th Street.

Some people are diehard Hostess fans, while others ride or die with Little Debbie.\n\nIn some areas, these choices can be polarizing and divisive. One person might be all in on the Big Mac, while their partner greatly prefers the Whopper.\n\nThe most polarizing battle, however, might be the choice between Coca-Cola and Pepsi.\n\nBoth companies have made public claims to be better than the other, and each one has restaurants and other partners such as theme parks, movie theaters, and arenas under exclusive deals.\n\nWhen a brand switches from Coke to Pepsi or vice versa, it's going to anger some customers, and that's exactly what Costco has done in its food court. The warehouse club has switched back to Coca-Cola products from PepsiCo brands.\n\nBecause Coke and Pepsi both have a large fan base, switching can anger some customers.\n\nI experienced a similar reaction last year aboard Carnival Celebration when the cruise line switched from Pepsi products to Coca-Cola mid-sailing. As inventory ran out, Coke fans hunted for remaining Coke products, while Pepsi drinkers searched for the last Mountain Dew and Pepsi, highlighting how emotionally charged soda loyalty can be.\n\nCostco rolled out the change toward the end of 2025 and finished swapping Pepsi products for Coca-Cola brands in the beginning of 2026.\n\nThat's not something Costco has commented on extensively, but CEO Ron Vachris addressed it during the question-and-answer session of the retailer's annual meeting.\n\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\n\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\n\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\n\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\n\n“Yes, that is accurate,” Vachris said. “This summer, we will begin converting our food court fountain business back over to Coca-Cola.”\n\nCostco had been under an exclusive deal with Pepsi since 2013.\n\n\"Costco originally made the switch to Pepsi in 2013 as a cost-saving measure, in order to keep the price of their famous hot dog and soda combo at $1.50. At the time, Pepsi was offering Walmart a better pricing deal that Costco couldn’t match. When Costco asked Coke for the same pricing, Coke refused, leading Costco to pull all Coke products from their stores for an entire month,\" Costco Insider reported.",

    "description": "Microplastics are everywhere. We drink them in our water, we eat them in our food, we breathe them in our air, leading to – so we are told – alarming levels of plastic accumulating in our tissues.",
    "fullText": "Microplastics are everywhere. We drink them in our water, we eat them in our food, we breathe them in our air, leading to – so we are told – alarming levels of plastic accumulating in our tissues.\n\nSo it was somewhat of a shock this week when the Guardian published a “bombshell” article suggesting that scientists may be overstating the health concerns. The award-winning journalist Damian Carrington, a champion of green issues, accepted that he himself had warned of the dangers, but said there was mounting concern over the technology used to detect tiny pieces of plastics in the body.\n\nThe article followed a recent letter published in Nature Medicine which questioned the analytical techniques used to detect microplastics in human tissue, warning they lacked controls and validation. One of the signatories, Dr Dusan Materic, of the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Germany, argued that fat in the body can give a false positive for polyethylene, and said the obesity epidemic could be behind the perceived rise in bodily plastic.\n\nDr Fazel Monikh, of the University of Padua, Italy, another signatory, who has spent a decade working on the detection of nanomaterials in biological samples, says he has never come across the kinds of microplastics reported in recent studies. “When particulate materials enter a living organism, including the human body, they undergo biotransformation,” he tells The Telegraph.\n\n“Even if one were to assume the highly unlikely scenario in which an intact particle reaches a protected compartment, such as the brain, and is then successfully detected, it would not retain the appearance shown in most of the reported data.\n\n“For these reasons, most of the presented results and their interpretation are not scientifically convincing to me, nor to my colleagues who are experts in this field.”\n\nMicroplastics were first detected in the human body in 2018 when Austrian scientists analysed stool samples of people in eight countries – including Britain – and found every one contained the tiny particles. Such research is not in doubt, and there is good evidence that humans do ingest tens of thousands of plastic particles each year. The sticking point is whether these become embedded in tissues, causing long-term harm.\n\nThe problem seems to lie in the tinier versions of microplastics, known as nanoplastics.\n\nOfficially, microplastics are no larger than 5mm in size (the size of a grain of rice or smaller) whereas nanoplastics are 1nm to 1,000nm in size (as small as bacteria) and are a lot harder to detect. In recent years, studies have claimed to have found these miniscule particles in nearly every human organ and tissue, including the lungs, liver, kidneys, heart, brain, placenta, testicles, bone marrow and blood.\n\nIt is feared that these tiny intruders carry toxic chemicals which cause inflammation and cell damage, as well as disrupting hormones, damaging microbes in the gut, lowering IQ, decreasing fertility and increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, heart attacks and strokes. The paper which sparked the recent Nature Medicine rebuttal letter claimed to have found microplastics and nanoplastics in the brain, which the scientists behind it linked to dementia.\n\nSuch studies have sparked a wave of eco-anxiety, with people switching to plastic-free tea bags and ditching water bottles, kitchen sponges, polyethylene chopping boards and non-stick saucepans.\n\nBut there are concerns that because microplastics are so prevalent in the environment it is difficult to tease out whether they really are getting into human tissue, or if samples are just contaminated during the process of collecting and analysing them. Lab testing should include “blanks” – control samples of clean water or inert material processed like real samples to detect contamination – but many studies do not.\n\nFay Couceiro, professor of environmental pollution at the University of Portsmouth says: “I don’t think that there is any doubt that there are microplastics in us – they are everywhere and we are breathing and eating them daily, so that they are in us is inevitable.\n\n“I think the question raised is more about where in the body they are stored and what quantity there is.\n\n“Some studies – particularly those based on humans – don’t follow the full standard methodologies used in environmental sampling around blanks, replicates and recovery checks.”\n\nWith large microplastics, scientists can easily spot particles under a microscope and then fire a laser at them to see if they are plastic. But with nanoplastics, scientists must burn the particle and measure the gases emitted, which is less reliable and still in its infancy as a technique.\n\nThis unreliability of testing has made researchers more sceptical about the more alarmist findings. An abstract presented at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology last year showing microplastics in human reproductive fluids was met with raised eyebrows among scientists.\n\n“Many previous scary-sounding headlines on microplastics in blood and food have turned out to be measurement errors,” warns Oliver Jones, professor of chemistry at RMIT University, Melbourne, referring to reports that preceded last year’s findings.\n\nLikewise, separate claims that microplastics had been found in human blood in 2022 were criticised by a US chemist as being “consistent with incidental or accidental contaminations”, in a letter to the Environmental International journal.\n\nEven Dr Philipp Schwabl, of the Medical University of Vienna, who found the original evidence of microplastics in human bodies is unsure about their health impacts. “The question of how harmful these little foreign plastic bodies truly are remains open to me and thus constitutes a crucial field of environmental biology that remains to be scientifically elucidated,” he says.\n\nYet despite the testing issues, many experts are still convinced microplastics are causing harm.\n\nProf Philip Landrigan, a paediatrician and epidemiologist at Boston College in the US, led a recent review into microplastics for the Lancet, and says people should not dismiss the dangers. “The Guardian article is accurate in pointing out that there is work to be done in refining, standardising and harmonising the analytical techniques for examining microplastics in tissue samples,” he says.\n\n“There is a need especially to distinguish microplastics from lipids [fats]. But the Guardian is wrong in implying that this whole area of science is rubbish.\n\n“The presence of microplastics in the human body needs to be taken seriously, even if we don’t yet know all the ways in which they may harm health. They cannot be wished away.”\n\nThe Medical University of Vienna recently developed a new imaging technique which can detect plastics without needing to burn up samples. They say it reduces contamination risk and allows scientists to find direct correlations between tissue samples and disease.\n\nAnd Dr Matthew Campen, of the University of New Mexico, lead author of the brain study that was challenged in Nature Medicine, said his team had hosted a microplastics conference in the last few days in which “convincing” new evidence had been presented of particles in cerebrospinal fluid. “Our paper is actually very clear on where uncertainties lie and how these may impact the interpretation of results,” he added. “We are 100 per cent confident that nanoplastics are in the brain.”\n\nProf Lukas Kenner, deputy director of the Department of Pathology at the Medical University of Vienna, says: “The concerns raised are understandable but a blanket dismissal of the entire body of evidence is not scientifically justified.\n\n“While early studies certainly had methodological limitations, the field has advanced rapidly.\n\n“There is now good evidence that microplastics can enter and accumulate in the human body, and growing experimental evidence that they are biologically active rather than inert.”\n\nFor now, it seems the scientific community is split on the true impact of microplastics and it may be several years before consensus is reached on the harms. The debate over the extent to which they enter and remain in human bodies will be a key part of those discussions.\n\nWhile some fear that plastics could be the modern-day equivalent of asbestos, lead or tobacco, it may be that the particles are processed or ejected by the body before they do long-term damage.\n\nProf Christian Dunn, an expert in microplastic pollution at Bangor University in Wales, says: “When it comes to nanoplastics I think we’re still pushing the boundaries as to what we can confidently detect.\n\n“The extent of how much of this plastic is entering and accumulating in our organs, and the damage this is doing to us, is still up for scientific discovery.”\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "McDonald's CEO predicts three food trends will reign supreme in 2026.\n\nChris Kempczinski, the fast-food chain's top boss, took to Instagram on Monday to tell his followers what diners will crave this year.\n\nBut before spilling the secrets, he said he wanted to \"do a little bit of a victory lap\" because all his 2025 predictions came true. His big bets for 2025 were protein, AI in fast food, and sauces, all of which had their moments last year.\n\nHere's what's on his 2026 list.\n\nThe first item on Kempczinski's 2026 list was fiber, which he said is \"going to be big.\"\n\nThis is not a surprise, as the dietary trend \"fibermaxxing\" has had its fair share of airtime over the past year. Dieticians say that consuming more fiber helps aid gut health, lower cholesterol, and reduce the risk of colon cancer.\n\nPepsiCo's CEO Ramon Laguarta did beat Kempczinski to the punch, predicting in an October earnings call that \"fiber will be the next protein.\"\n\nThe second item on his list was a unique flavor combination: \"Sweet and spicy together is going to be a big food trend.\"\n\nFast food chains have already jumped on the trend. In 2025, chains like Chipotle, KFC, and Taco Bell all rolled out hot honey dipping sauces.\n\nThis trend is a continuation of his \"sauces\" prediction from last year. In 2025, Kempczinski said sauces, rather than the main dish, would be diners' focus.\n\n\"Spicy is always in,\" he said then. \"I think you might see some honey or some sweet stuff.\"\n\nMcDonald's does have a sweet-spicy sauce offering in its Creamy Chili McCrispy Strip Dip.\n\nAnd lastly, Kempczinski said, \"You're going to see a lot of beverage innovation.\"\n\nOver the past year, fast food chains have rolled out new beverages, with some, such as Taco Bell and Chick-fil-A, launching new beverage-focused spin-offs. Taco Bell opened its Live Más Café chain, and Chick-fil-A opened its Daybright chain, both selling coffees and fruity refreshers.\n\nOne reason for Kempczinski's prediction of drink innovation could be that Gen Z consumers are not huge fans of alcohol, but rather are on the hunt for exciting and unusual drink combinations.",

    "description": "Brooke Rollins suggested eating ‘a piece of chicken, a piece of broccoli, corn tortilla and one other thing’ as Americans struggle to put food on the table",
    "fullText": "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has been mocked online over a “depression meal” she suggested for Americans after the Trump administration turned the food pyramid upside down.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture recently released new dietary guidelines, suggesting Americans eat more protein, dairy and healthy fats and less whole grains. Rollins and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who previously said he was on a so-called carnivore diet, told Americans when rolling out the guidelines to “eat real food.”\n\nIn a TV appearance on Wednesday, Rollins suggested an affordable, albeit lackluster, meal Americans can make that sticks to the new guidelines.\n\n“We've run over 1,000 simulations. It can cost around $3 a meal for a piece of chicken, a piece of broccoli, corn tortilla and one other thing. And so, there is a way to do this that actually will save the average American consumer money,” Rollins told News Nation.\n\nA clip of Rollins' comments was shared online, and social media users were quick to poke fun at the out-of-touch dining suggestion.\n\n“Private jets and tax breaks for them and their rich friends, and one piece of broccoli *AND* a tortilla for you!” Chasten Glezman Buttigieg, the husband of former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, wrote on X.\n\nMarlow Stern, who teaches at the Columbia Journalism School, posted, “‘You should eat prison meals’ prob not the best message.”\n\n“One whole tortilla?!” Democratic strategist Jennifer Holdsworth sarcastically said.\n\nFred Wellman, podcast host and Democratic Congressional candidate, wrote, “They hate so much of America. They just hate them.”\n\n“Are they doing Monte Carlo simulations to create the most affordable r/depressionmeal,” Tyson Brody, who identifies as an opposition researcher, posted.\n\nWhile inflation held steady in December at 2.7 percent, grocery prices remained high, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index. Uncooked ground beef was up 15.5 percent, and frozen fish and seafood increased 8.6 percent year-on-year.\n\nHealth experts Lauren Ball and Emily Burch weighed in on the new dietary guidelines’ lack of attention to socio-economic issues when it comes to food.\n\n“Access to affordable, healthy food remains limited across the US, especially for people in low-income communities, rural areas, or those working long and unpredictable hours,” the two wrote for The Independent. “People choose food based on whether it’s affordable, accessible and culturally relevant – but the guidelines overlooked these structural drivers.”",

Within six months, the location closed and was replaced by a nail salon.\n\nChange comes with risk, and similar brands are not always equitable. If your McDonald's closed and was replaced by a Wendy's, some people would be happy, while others would be indifferent, and some would be upset.\n\nThat's the risk Dutch Bros Coffee is taking with its latest purchase.\n\nClutch Coffee, a drive-thru coffee chain founded in 2018, shared its big news on Facebook.\n\n\"Exciting changes ahead! We’re switching gears. We have reached an agreement with Dutch Bros, and Clutch’s last day of business will be this Friday 1/16, closing @ 4 p.m. You can keep the good energy going with Dutch Bros and download the Dutch Bros app,\" the chain shared.\n\nAll 20 Clutch Coffee locations will close on Jan. 16, then reopen at a later date as Dutch Bros. locations.\n\n\"The plan will be for restaurants to close, renovate, and then reopen as Dutch Bros.

    "fullText": "Musk attempts to recast AI tool’s misuse. Plus, tech billionaires plot against a proposed California tax on their fortunes\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, US tech editor for the Guardian. Today, we discuss Elon Musk’s rosy depiction of Grok’s image generation controversy; the seven-figure panic among Silicon Valley billionaires over a proposed wealth tax in California, though with one notable exception; and how AI and robotics have revitalized the Consumer Electronics Showcase.\n\nThe firestorm over the Grok AI tool has been raging for more than a week now, and it shows no signs of dying down.\n\nLast week, I wrote about the rising backlash against Elon Musk’s Grok AI tool, which in recent weeks has allowed users to generate thousands of sexualized images of women. Some of the images show real women, some are fake, some are nonconsensual, and some depict children, all in “minimal clothing”, as the AI tool itself described them.\n\nX and its parent company, xAI, have taken some measures to curb the flood. The social network shut off its image generation feature for users who do not pay, which constitute the majority of X’s users.\n\nThroughout the controversy, Musk has obstinately recast the AI tool’s problems as everything but what they really are. He’s been promoting its popularity as if it were a piece of productivity software. He crows about its download numbers with dubious claims. On 10 January; he celebrated Grok reaching the top spot in New Zealand’s version of Apple’s App Store. (Rankings by the analytics firm SimilarWeb of the most-downloaded apps in New Zealand, which were updated the same day as Musk’s tweet, put Grok in 14th place.) The same day, he reposted a tweet about Grok reaching the No 1 spot in Thailand’s Apple App Store. (SimilarWeb’s rankings do not show Grok in the top 50 most-downloaded apps in the country.) On 9 January, he retweeted a post about Google searches for Grok spiking. (I would guess the increase in searches is evidence of great interest in the AI tool’s scandal more so than interest in using it.)\n\nIn response to the UK’s threats to ban the AI tool, he accused the country’s government of stifling free speech. After watchdogs cited instances of Grok undressing minors, he said: “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” handing the responsibility to moderate his social network to law enforcement and courts. “Illegal” is in a court’s hands and frees him from moderating all but the most heinous content.\n\nPerhaps to Musk, all press is good press? He may be right: his AI tool seems likely to accrue more users and few penalties as a result of the flood of nearly naked images.\n\nGrok has faced some repercussions: the UK’s communications regulator, Ofcom, has launched an investigation into xAI and Grok, and possible punishments could include a total ban. The Internet Watch Foundation, also based in the UK, announced it had found instances of child sexual abuse material generated by Grok in Dark Web forums. X’s revenue in the UK has plummeted by 60% as concerns over content moderation and brand safety grow. Both Indonesia and Malaysia have limited access to the AI tool in response.\n\nBut missing from the chorus decrying Grok are the two de facto smartphone regulators of smartphone software, Apple and Google, operators of the world’s biggest mobile app stores. Neither has indicated whether the Grok’s output violates their app stores’ terms of service. In the US, there’s been little backlash from regulators and lawmakers.\n\nThe lesson for Musk and other tech leaders seems apparent: the fewer restrictions you place on AI, the more shocking content you allow it to generate, the greater your engagement and your profit.\n\nTech’s billionaires are plotting against a proposed tax on their fortunes that may appear on ballots across California in November.\n\nVenture capitalist and antichrist evangelist Peter Thiel has already made a $3m donation to fight the proposal, according to campaign finance disclosures filed with the state. Other billionaires have started an encrypted group chat on Signal to strategize against it, which includes Anduril founder Palmer Luckey, Trump’s AI and crypto “czar” David Sacks, according to the Wall Street Journal. It’s called “Save California”. My colleague Dara Kerr reports on the division among billionaires:\n\nUnder a tax proposal that could be put to voters this November, any California resident worth more than $1bn would have to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state.\n\nSeveral Silicon Valley figures have already threatened to leave California and take their business elsewhere. But Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, whose net worth is nearly $159bn, told Bloomberg Television this week that he is “perfectly fine with it”.\n\nThis puts Huang in stark contrast with the Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, the venture capitalist David Sacks, all of whom have recently indicated they are leaving California for tax-friendlier states including Florida and Texas.\n\nUnder the proposed tax, Huang would pay roughly $7bn, and Page and Brin would pay one-time amounts of about $13bn and $12bn, respectively, based on their current net worth of $264bn and $243bn. Thiel would pay $1.3bn, based on his current net worth of $26bn.\n\nThe Consumer Electronics Show, held annually in Las Vegas for decades since its start in 1967, made global news this year. Nvidia and AMD chose it as the forum for major announcements on new hardware and software. Samsung announced a double folding phone, the Galaxy Z Fold 3, and Lego debuted a “smart brick” that seems quite fun as well. Robots abounded, rechristened as “physical AI”.\n\nIt’s been quite the turnaround for CES. For much of the 2010s, hardware announcements rarely made for top headlines. New DVD players or TVs did not make a splash. Smartphones dominated, and they all looked extremely similar. Apple, the most valuable company in the world at the end of the decade, even skipped it entirely. Now, however, Nvidia is the most valuable company in the world, and it chose CES to present what’s next. Artificial intelligence and robotics have breathed new life into CES. The themes and innovations that define the convention are broader and affect more industries outside tech than they once did.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I predicted that consumer technology would take many strange new shapes in the coming year, which seems to already be true as we view new developments in robotics. Humanoid robots debuted at CES, including one from Hyundai and Boston Dynamics. My colleague Samuel Gibbs dubbed a laundry-folding robot one of the best things about the convention.\n\nMeta blocked nearly 550,000 accounts in first days of Australia’s under-16s social media ban\n\nIran’s internet shutdown is chillingly precise and may last some time\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet hits $4tn valuation after AI deal with Apple\n\n‘Dangerous and alarming’: Google removes some of its AI summaries after users’ health put at risk",

    "fullText": "The plan was to get on a bicycle to earn some money. It wasn’t to get hit by cars, thumped by skinheads or to see my surroundings in a whole new light\n\nGet our weekend culture and lifestyle email\n\nAt first I didn’t realise I’d been punched. I’m not sure why my brain assumed a bird had flown into me, but I suppose a magpie attack was more likely than a random bloke lashing out at my ribcage, so it took a second to realise what was happening.\n\nI was on my bike, waiting in a sidestreet for traffic to clear. The punch came from behind and by the time my mouth let fly a few expletives, the culprit was leaving. Then he caught wind of my colourful language and turned back to get in my face. He was a skinhead in a bad mood. Accusing me of being in his way, he told me I was lucky he didn’t do more damage. I paused mid-reply. This was the moment I realised he was ready to go to hell tonight, and the only thing he wanted to take with him was me.\n\nWhen you deliver for companies like Uber Eats, no two shifts are the same. I’d say 80% of my deliveries are fast food – a combination of McDonald’s, KFC, Hungry Jacks and coffee. Lots of coffee. My new workplace couldn’t be more different than the grey blur of an office, surrounded by the same walls and same people week after week. The culture shock of going from comfy chairs and morning teas to trying not to get killed in traffic was significant.\n\nAfter being made redundant four times in six years, months passed with hundreds of unsuccessful job applications. Bills needed to be paid. The big ones were still looming, but the small costs could be covered by delivering for Uber Eats. My Xbox was gathering dust so I sold it at Cash Converters and put the money towards a half-decent mountain bike.\n\nThe first thing that hits you riding is the feeling of independence. In between delivering Grey Goose vodka and KFC Zinger burgers, there’s the realisation that it’s just you out there. After four months, I haven’t talked to anyone at Uber Eats. I signed up on my phone, they sent me a fluoro thermal bag, and off I went. I don’t have to worry about anybody making me redundant because there is no anybody – there’s just me. If I want to spend hours in the park eating lunch, I will. Need more sleep? That’s between me and my doona. Granted, my wages are much lower, but what value can be placed on listening to Wu-Tang Clan with wind in my hair versus dreading another company restructure?\n\nJust to be clear, my hair is secure underneath a helmet. Which was good for when I collided with a car and ended up with a face full of road. There are lots of bike paths in Melbourne, but far too many of them are squeezed in between moving traffic and parked traffic. They’re less than a metre wide and often occupied by wavering cars, massive trucks or in this case, part of a parked Ford Fiesta. Before I could react, a driver had opened their door into the bike lane without looking. I couldn’t do anything except stop my bike dead while my body crashed into the bitumen.\n\nThings like this happen too often. I tore up my knee when my front wheel got caught in a tram track (a uniquely Melbourne problem) and my cheek laid against the road as I watched one of my earpods get crushed underneath a truck. A ute with aftermarket exhausts forced me into a gutter and my shins still haven’t recovered. It didn’t take long before I realised I could never relax on this job. My attention needs to be on 10 different things from one second to the next. My muscles are always tense, my brain always on alert. After a shift, it’s not unusual for my mind and body to immediately crash.\n\nI always knew urban planning was designed around cars but now I feel it in my bones. Not only is the amount of space dedicated to cars immense, society focuses on cars first. Shopfronts and advertisements face the road, hundreds of car parks take up thousands of metres and I avoid countless potholes in bike lanes while the cars right next to me drive on pristine asphalt.\n\nThere’s also a stark difference between people in cars and people I deliver to. When I hand over my orders, most are friendly. They’re dealing with hangovers or excited to get their comfort food. I once said “Pizza time!” to some young kids and they cheered. On the other hand, if there’s a form of life that’s lower than cyclists in the eyes of cars, it’s Uber Eats bikes.\n\nSome customers I’ve delivered to have been downright apologetic. I suppose they feel guilty for getting their Maccas order delivered when they live around the corner. No judgment from me; I still get my bonus for doing nine deliveries by 2pm. Uber Eats regularly gamifies their rewards for drivers: from week to week, they offer financial bonuses for set time periods. Let’s say you wake up on Monday and the app promotes an offer to do 30 orders before Thursday. Complete this task, and you’ll get $72 extra. It’s nice but unreliable. They’re random events based on demand and location. It can be a big bonus or a big nothing. Then it simply becomes how much effort you’re willing to put in. Another factor of being independent.\n\nUltimately, this job isn’t a long-term solution. It’s a Band-Aid on a broken leg. The jury is still out on whether it’s better than being stuck at a desk. Air-conditioning versus sizzling heat. Freedom of movement versus monitored hours. Meetings that could have been an email versus an outdoor activity that is improving my fitness but has a very real chance of causing my untimely death. The money’s not as good but I meet nice people, get to know my city and choose my own hours.",

    "fullText": "Matthew Landry, a dietitian, studies how our diets can prevent heart attacks later in life.\n\nLandry recommends making simple food swaps to control cholesterol levels.\n\nOpt for olive oil over butter and chicken over red meat, he said.\n\nA nutrition researcher and dietitian who studies how simple habits can protect our hearts shared three simple food swaps.\n\nCardiovascular disease is the No. 1 cause of death in the US, but research has found that eating a Mediterranean-style diet and being physically active can help lower the risk. The American Heart Association's dietary guidelines recommend prioritizing fresh produce, whole grains, lean proteins such as fish, and limiting ultra-processed foods and refined sugar.\n\nThat may sound like a lot, but Matthew Landry told Business Insider that you don't necessarily need to overhaul your diet to improve your heart health.\n\nLandy, an assistant professor at the University of California, Irvine, suggested considering: \"how can we make simple swaps with our diet? How can we engage in more physical activity, and do very simple things that all add up to help prevent a heart attack later?\"\n\nHere are his three suggestions:\n\nLandry's first swap relates to the type of fat used for cooking. He suggests switching butter or lard for heart-healthy fats like olive oil or avocado oil.\n\n\"We're not necessarily changing the food, we're just changing how we're sometimes preparing it,\" he said.\n\nAnimal products and full-fat dairy products like beef tallow, butter, and cream contain saturated fat, which can drive up our LDL or \"bad cholesterol levels, Landry said. If a person has too much LDL cholesterol in their blood, it can form a sticky plaque in their arteries, putting them at greater risk of heart disease.\n\nWe need fat as part of a balanced diet, but unsaturated fats, found in foods such as avocados, fatty fish, nuts, and olive oil, don't raise our LDL cholesterol nearly as much as saturated fat, he said.\n\nThere's one finding that keeps cropping up in Landry's research: reducing red meat consumption lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nLandry worked on a 2023 study in which 22 pairs of identical twins were assigned either a vegan or an omnivorous diet for eight weeks. It was the focus of a Netflix documentary titled \"You Are What You Eat: A Twin Experiment.\"\n\nThis doesn't mean you have to cut out meat entirely, Landry said, but he recommended swapping red and processed meats, including beef, pork, and sausages, for leaner options like poultry, such as chicken and turkey, or fish, which are lower in saturated fat.\n\nIt's also a good idea to add plant-based protein sources to your diet. \"Eventually, I would love for folks to even move further than that and start consuming some plant-based proteins, some beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh. Those are great things for our heart as well,\" he said.\n\nFiber is great at keeping cholesterol levels \"nice and stable,\" Landry said, but most Americans don't eat enough. Ninety percent of women, and 97% of men, don't meet the recommended 30 grams of fiber a day, according to the 2020 to 2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The 2025 to 2030 guidelines recommend two to four servings of whole grains a day.\n\nWhole grains such as brown rice, quinoa, and whole-wheat bread are good sources of fiber and can easily replace their white counterparts, which tend to be low in fiber. One cup of brown rice, for example, contains 3.5 grams of fiber, while a cup of white rice contains 0.6 grams.\n\n\"We can still have bread, we can still have rice,\" Landry, said, \"but the whole grain version.\"",

    "description": "After visiting 29 states last year, I fell in love with Maine. The state's food, friendly people, and gorgeous scenery all made me feel at home.",
    "fullText": "Last year, my husband and I drove across the country, spending quality time in 29 states. Although we visited so many great destinations, if I had to pick one to move to, it would definitely be Maine.\n\nWith picturesque beach towns, lighthouses dotting the coastline, and lobster boats puttering through the harbors, Maine lived up to all my expectations of the ideal New England destination.\n\nPlus, its wooded natural preserves, delicious food, and kind people truly won me over.\n\nIf there's one thing that's synonymous with Maine, it's lighthouses. And for good reason: the state has 65 of them positioned along the coast, islands, and inlets.\n\nDuring our one-month stay in Portland, we visited six, including the West Quoddy Head Light — located on the US's easternmost peninsula — and the iconic Portland Head Light.\n\nPlus, some of the most scenic lighthouses are in the stunning Acadia National Park. While visiting, we stopped by Bass Harbor Head Light Station and hiked down to the rocks below the tower. Looking up at the beacon offered a unique vantage point I didn't experience anywhere else.\n\nAlthough the coast may get a lot of attention, Maine's inland sections offer just as many opportunities to spend time outside and explore quirky towns.\n\nFor hiking, there are countless trails and nature reserves to roam, my favorite of which was the Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens.\n\nAlthough the tree-covered trails were beautiful, our main mission was to find the massive trolls made out of recycled wood. These gentle giants made the trip to the gardens even more memorable.\n\nWe also took a trip up to Bangor, Maine, which is known for its most famous former resident: Stephen King.\n\nWe walked by his house (which is as spooky as you'd expect) and checked out the imposing water tower that is often said to be the inspiration for his novel \"It.\"\n\nIf there's one food you have to try in Maine, it's lobster — specifically, the lobster roll.\n\nFor the sake of comparison, I tried both varieties that are popular in Maine: the cold Maine-style roll (which mixes chilled lobster with mayo and celery) and the warm Connecticut-style, which tosses lobster meat in warm butter. Although the cold roll may be the more traditional style, the butter won me over.\n\nSeafood was popular across the board in Maine, but I found that my other favorite dishes were desserts. For example, the whoopie pies had the perfect level of springy sponge and decadent cream, and the potato doughnuts offered a heartier, less sweet take on the classic treat.\n\nWe also happened to be visiting during blueberry season, which runs from late July to early September. We enjoyed blueberry tarts, scones with blueberry jam, and even blueberry-infused beer served with a generous handful of the berries floating in the glass.\n\nHowever, these weren't made with the blueberries I was used to buying at the grocery store. Instead, these Maine delicacies were crafted with wild blueberries, which are about half the size and much sweeter than the \"typical\" blueberry I usually enjoy.\n\nWhether at a lobster shack along a rural highway or in one of the state's many breweries, the people we met were quite friendly and quick to strike up a conversation.\n\nLocals seemed to genuinely love living in Maine (as opposed to some states we stayed in, where residents would ask, \"Why did you choose to visit here?\")\n\nThe most palpable community spirit I experienced was at a Portland Hearts of Pine soccer game. Here, we saw folks running into neighbors and chatting with seatmates.\n\nThe energy in the crowd was contagious, and we quickly found ourselves singing along to the team chant.\n\nFrom the food to the beaches, I fell in love with everything that Maine had to offer. At the same time, I recognize that spending July in the Pine Tree State is very different from visiting in January.\n\nWould I still love Maine as much when there's snow on the ground and a frigid breeze blowing in from the Atlantic? Based on everything I experienced, I believe so.\n\nI guess I'll just have to plan another trip to find out.",

    "description": "Matthew Landry, a nutrition researcher and dietitian, studies how what we eat can prevent heart attacks later in life.",
    "fullText": "A nutrition researcher and dietitian who studies how simple habits can protect our hearts shared three simple food swaps.\n\nCardiovascular disease is the No. 1 cause of death in the US, but research has found that eating a Mediterranean-style diet and being physically active can help lower the risk. The American Heart Association's dietary guidelines recommend prioritizing fresh produce, whole grains, lean proteins such as fish, and limiting ultra-processed foods and refined sugar.\n\nThat may sound like a lot, but Matthew Landry told Business Insider that you don't necessarily need to overhaul your diet to improve your heart health.\n\nLandy, an assistant professor at the University of California, Irvine, suggested considering: \"how can we make simple swaps with our diet? How can we engage in more physical activity, and do very simple things that all add up to help prevent a heart attack later?\"\n\nHere are his three suggestions:\n\nLandry's first swap relates to the type of fat used for cooking. He suggests switching butter or lard for heart-healthy fats like olive oil or avocado oil.\n\n\"We're not necessarily changing the food, we're just changing how we're sometimes preparing it,\" he said.\n\nAnimal products and full-fat dairy products like beef tallow, butter, and cream contain saturated fat, which can drive up our LDL or \"bad cholesterol levels, Landry said. If a person has too much LDL cholesterol in their blood, it can form a sticky plaque in their arteries, putting them at greater risk of heart disease.\n\nWe need fat as part of a balanced diet, but unsaturated fats, found in foods such as avocados, fatty fish, nuts, and olive oil, don't raise our LDL cholesterol nearly as much as saturated fat, he said.\n\nThere's one finding that keeps cropping up in Landry's research: reducing red meat consumption lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nLandry worked on a 2023 study in which 22 pairs of identical twins were assigned either a vegan or an omnivorous diet for eight weeks. It was the focus of a Netflix documentary titled \"You Are What You Eat: A Twin Experiment.\"\n\nThis doesn't mean you have to cut out meat entirely, Landry said, but he recommended swapping red and processed meats, including beef, pork, and sausages, for leaner options like poultry, such as chicken and turkey, or fish, which are lower in saturated fat.\n\nIt's also a good idea to add plant-based protein sources to your diet. \"Eventually, I would love for folks to even move further than that and start consuming some plant-based proteins, some beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh. Those are great things for our heart as well,\" he said.\n\nFiber is great at keeping cholesterol levels \"nice and stable,\" Landry said, but most Americans don't eat enough. Ninety percent of women, and 97% of men, don't meet the recommended 30 grams of fiber a day, according to the 2020 to 2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The 2025 to 2030 guidelines recommend two to four servings of whole grains a day.\n\nWhole grains such as brown rice, quinoa, and whole-wheat bread are good sources of fiber and can easily replace their white counterparts, which tend to be low in fiber. One cup of brown rice, for example, contains 3.5 grams of fiber, while a cup of white rice contains 0.6 grams.\n\n\"We can still have bread, we can still have rice,\" Landry, said, \"but the whole grain version.\"",

    "fullText": "Oprah Winfrey, 71, says growing older has made her more appreciative of her health, especially after using GLP-1s to manage obesity.\n\nIn an interview with CBS Sunday Morning, Winfrey spoke about how learning that obesity is a disease helped her stop seeing her weight as a personal failure.\n\n\"I'm not going to, but I could weep right now for all of the many days and nights I've journaled about this being my fault and why can't I conquer this thing?\" Winfrey told host Jane Pauley.\n\nWinfrey said the \"food noise\" in her head went away within hours on the first day she took a GLP-1 medication.\n\n\"There are tools to use that can help you. And I do see it as a tool,\" she said.\n\n\"I have become indifferent to food. I still love it. I still love it. But I'm not in any way obsessed about it,\" she said.\n\nWinfrey added that she's come to see the medication as something she needs to continue taking to manage obesity. If anything, she wishes she had known about it earlier.\n\n\"I have regret that I didn't discover it in 2013. I have regret that, oh my gosh, this has been going on for over 12 years now, and I didn't know about it,\" she said.\n\n\"I think about the wasted time. The wasted time, the wasted sadness and shame about it. I think about the wasted years,\" Winfrey said.\n\nStill, Winfrey said she has a new appreciation for her health and how she feels in her body today.\n\n\"I am just happy. This is what I feel. I feel that when I was 40 and ran a marathon, I certainly could appreciate the strength that it took to do that and the work that it took to get into that shape,\" she said. \"But there's something about being 71 that gives you a perspective and the long view of appreciation that's unlike any other time in your life.\"\n\nWinfrey added that while she felt good at 40, being strong and healthy at 71 has been much more meaningful.\n\n\"Because what it takes to be in the best shape of your life when you're 71 is a whole lot more than when you're 40,\" she added.\n\nHer lifelong struggles with weight have led her to recognize the value of having treatment options today.\n\n\"I have a sense of gratitude that I was able to live in a time where these medications were made available to people to change their lives,\" she said.\n\nWinfrey first revealed that she was using a type of GLP-1 medication in December 2023, but didn't disclose which one.\n\nIn December 2025, Winfrey told People that she went off the medication for a year because she wanted to prove that she could \"do without it,\" but ended up gaining 20 pounds.\n\n\"It's going to be a lifetime thing. I'm on high blood pressure medication, and if I go off the high blood pressure medication, my blood pressure is going to go up. The same thing is true now, I realize, with these medications. I've proven to myself I need it,\" Winfrey said.\n\nGLP-1 drugs, such as semaglutide, work by regulating hunger signals, allowing people to feel full while consuming less. However, these drugs can cause gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea and diarrhoea. Research has also shown that it is not uncommon for patients to regain the weight after stopping treatment.",

    "fullText": "Have you gotten enough protein today?\n\nThis question may have crossed your mind recently, as more and more Americans are becoming obsessed with their intake of the macronutrient.\n\nMust Read: Trump's 2026 Alcohol Tariffs Are Coming — Here's What'll Hurt The Most\n\nThe craze has ushered in a slew of new protein-packed products — from bars and powders to popcorns and pancake mixes — and has sent many of us scrambling to the meat department at our grocery store to get our fix.\n\nIn fact, one recent study found “U.S. meat consumption grew from 109 kg to 117 kg per capita between 2018 and 2023 and is projected to grow to 122 kg per capita in 2027.”\n\nBut should we be thinking twice about where our protein comes from and what dangers might be lurking if we jump mouth-first into a diet full of meat?\n\nThat’s what we — Raj Punjabi-Johnson and Noah Michelson, the hosts of HuffPost’s “Am I Doing It Wrong?” podcast — asked Elizabeth Dunn, a food journalist who’s written widely about nutrition, when she recently dropped by our studio.\n\nPress play to hear the full episode:\n\n“There definitely is this kind of perception online that if you’re going to live a high-protein life, that involves a lot of meat,” Dunn told us. “What you don’t hear talked about a lot in those contexts is the downsides to eating a lot of meat. The data is very, very clear — I mean, like decades of large-scale, reputable studies that show that the higher in meat your diet is, the higher your chances are of getting cancer, of getting diabetes, of all-cause mortality — meaning just basically dying younger. So there really are pretty big health consequences to eating a very meat-heavy diet, especially a very red meat-heavy or processed meat-heavy diet.”\n\nThere’s one popular protein-forward snack that especially concerns Dunn.\n\nMust Read: THIS Is The Color Bell Pepper To Eat If You Want Maximum Immune Support\n\n“One of the fastest growing snack categories right now is meat sticks,” she said. “Obviously, the protein trend is driving that, [and though] they also are very delicious, what really surprises me, especially because we’re in this very healthy, nutritious, conscious moment right now, is that people aren’t aware of the fact that processed meats are class one carcinogens — Group 1 carcinogens. So that’s a World Health Organization classification, and it means that we know that they cause cancer in humans. So this is really something that I think more people should think about.”\n\nDunn noted that the average American doesn’t need to supplement their diet with extra protein because they’re probably already getting the recommended daily allowance in their meals. However, if we are looking for more protein, she urged us to get it from whole foods, rather than processed ones.\n\nShe added that there’s protein in most foods, which means even people who don’t eat meat shouldn’t need to work too hard to get their daily needs met.\n\n“As long as you’re making a concerted effort as a vegetarian to eat a lot of different plants, like, you’re gonna get as much protein as you need,” she said.\n\nMust Read: Health Experts Have A Warning About Your Protein-Packed Waffles, Cookies And Snacks\n\nMichelson noted that “a cup of [cooked] spinach ... has five grams of protein in it, a cup of raw peas has eight grams of protein ... wild rice has six grams of protein in a cup.”\n\nWhole grains are also a “huge source of protein,” Dunn said.\n\n“I’m not just talking about quinoa — oats have a lot of protein in them, things like seeds, like hemp seeds and chia seeds, have a lot of protein ... It adds up a lot faster than you think.”\n\nSo if you’ve been anxious about not getting enough protein, worry not! You probably are, but if you want an extra boost, reach for whole foods — and maybe skip processed meats as a regular part of your diet.\n\nMust Read: 6 Foods That Surprisingly ‘Count’ As Vegetables, According To Nutrition Experts\n\nWe also chatted with Dunn about why we’re wasting our time and money if we’re getting too much protein, which nutrient we should probably be focusing on instead of protein, and much more.\n\nListen to the full episode above or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nMake sure to ” on whatever podcast platform you prefer so you don’t miss a single episode from our brand-new third season.
