    "description": "James Eagle founded UK artisan brand The Pished Fish in 2014 and is known for its booze-infused, Scandinavian style smoked salmon.",
    "fullText": "As a medical devices salesman, James Eagle travelled across Scandinavia and would frequently be met with salmon or gravlax as “the main event” on menus.\n\nBack in the UK, he felt that thinly-cut smoked salmon was a sidenote on our plates. “I always thought that was a shame,” says Eagle.\n\nRedundancy from his sales job in 2013 allowed Eagle to start a smokehouse from a small shed at the bottom of his garden in Camberwell, London, which turned from a hobby into the birth of his artisan brand – The Pished Fish.\n\n“In the UK, when you get a smoked salmon and cream cheese bagel, it’s the cream cheese and bagel you can taste,” adds Eagle. “How I likened it is with wafer-thin smoked salmon almost melting into the bagel.”\n\nEagle, who didn’t complete university, worked for drum and bass label Good Looking Records in the early 2000s and was PA to musician LTJ Bukem before turning to a career in sales.\n\nHowever, being laid off at the medical devices firm left a “sour taste” and taught him a lesson in \"how to look after my own staff now.”\n\nIn late 2014, Eagle ventured to farmers' markets with homemade smoked salmon made in what he describes as a “glorified filing cabinet” smoker. He would start at 1am for the laborious 16-hour process.\n\nHe produced three different flavours, sold out every weekend and it gave Eagle the confidence that a more lucrative business was in the offing.\n\nThe Pished Fish’s USP is using botanicals and alcohol – hence the fun company name – such as whisky, aquavit and vodka to flavour its booze-infused, Scandinavian-style smoked salmon. “The ones which I thought were more fun were done with alcohol,” he recalls of his early smokehouse testing.\n\nAfter meeting his now wife, Hermione, through dating site My Single Friend, the couple had attended a course on how to start a food business. Eagle’s main takeaway was not to rely on the product but to have a compelling brand.\n\nHe spent £4,000 on a design and logo. “Having someone to properly imagine what it could be was really important,” he says. “I felt it was an awful amount of money at the time, but it was the best money you could spend.”\n\nWhen a fishmonger at Selfridges later spotted the brand, the Eagles moved to East Sussex and went full-time to upscale the business. The start-up was housed on his father’s land near the Sussex Downs, at first in two shipping containers before moving to an adjacent building where Eagle today employs eight full-time staff.",

So what did Death Stranding 2 originally look like? For starters, it would have involved a lot more high-end fashion for its protagonist, Sam Porter Bridges, and his allies.\nKojima recently posted images online from the upcoming Death Stranding 2 art book, showing off a \"pre-COVID\" look at Bridges and Fragile.",

It comprised a white pleated skirt with a black, button-up blouse tucked in.\n\nUnfortunately, the two pieces sat loosely on Anderson and appeared too formal.\n\nHer leather belt, sheer tights, pointed heels, and black purse added some fun to the look, but the base layers were ultimately too simple for them to work.\n\nWhile entering the Ralph Lauren show, Reinhart was photographed wearing a brown tweed blazer as a top with a thick brown belt holding it closed at the waist.\n\nShe also wore a long black skirt covered in leather fringe, which added texture and contrast to the ensemble.\n\nHigh black boots and a small brown purse completed the fun, fashion-forward look.\n\nAlso at the Tory Burch show, Seyfried wore a golden, long-sleeved blouse atop a blue midi skirt with silver stripes. She also wore white heels with silver adornments and carried a blue purse.\n\nThe mix of two metallic shades with blue tones created a unique, fun color combination that complemented her hair and skin tone.\n\nOutside the Tory Burch runway show, the Olympic gymnast was photographed wearing an oversize blue jacket with a form-fitting wrap skirt in a vibrant red shade.\n\nThe two pieces were drastically different in style, and they overwhelmed her petite frame. They also didn't match the lime-green top she wore or her black accessories.\n\nThe \"Stranger Things\" actor attended the show in blue jeans, a button-up top, and a leather jacket that matched his sneakers and Coach purse.\n\nThe latter piece was especially fun. It featured a prominent pocket reminiscent of a coin purse and two keychains that looked like miniature books.\n\nMcLaughlin has been one of the best-dressed men at New York Fashion Week so far.\n\nThe model sat in the stands wearing skinny black pants with a billowing blouse. The semi-sheer white garment had a high neckline, balloon sleeves, and extra fabric at the waist that extended into a train.\n\nThe top piece was dramatic and memorable, while her pants were perfectly tailored to highlight her dramatically pointed heels.\n\nFor the Michael Kors runway show, the actor wore an all-white ensemble that included trousers, a loose-fitting blouse, sneakers, and a trench coat.\n\nThe outfit would have worked for him if it featured more than one color. Because the entire ensemble was stark white, each piece blended into the others, creating the illusion that he was wearing a baggy jumpsuit.",

    "fullText": "COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) — Bob Evans, the chain of family-style restaurants founded and headquartered in central Ohio, has a new owner.\n\nNew York-based investment firm 4×4 Capital announced on Feb. 4 that it has acquired Bob Evans Restaurants. The deal transfers ownership of the 78-year-old brand from San Francisco-based private equity firm Golden Gate Capital. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\n\nBob Evans operates more than 400 restaurants in 18 states and employs more than 15,000 people. The company is based in New Albany and traces its roots to a 12-stool diner opened in 1948 by founder Bob Evans in Gallipolis, Ohio.\n\nDublin keeps Irish Festival ticket prices unchanged for 2026\n\n“We are proud of what we accomplished in partnership with Golden Gate Capital and excited to begin this next chapter with 4×4’s hands-on partnership,” said Mickey Mills, the restaurant chain’s CEO, who will continue to lead the brand. “Together, we look forward to investing in and enhancing our operations, guest experience, and brand.”\n\nGolden Gate Capital purchased Bob Evans in 2017 for $565 million. At the time, the firm split the restaurants from Bob Evans Farms, the brand’s consumer-packaged good business, which was acquired by Post Holdings for $1.5 billion.\n\nIn 2022, Golden Gate explored a potential $600 million sale of the restaurant chain, though a transaction did not materialize. Reports in 2024 indicated the company had hired investment bank Kroll to oversee another sale process.\n\n“We are truly grateful to the terrific team at Bob Evans for their strong stewardship of this iconic brand,” said Neale Attenborough, a managing director at Golden Gate. “We wish the team all the best as they enter their next phase of growth.”\n\n‘Love is Blind’ fans buzzing over central Ohio ties\n\nBob Evans boasts itself as a farm-inspired, family-style restaurant brand known for breakfast offerings, such as its Farmer’s Choice Breakfast, and roasted turkey dinners.\n\n4×4 Capital, founded in 2018, focuses on investing in middle-market consumer goods and services companies across North America. The firm said it takes an active ownership approach aimed at accelerating growth and operational performance.\n\n“What truly sets the Bob Evans brand apart is its distinctive hospitality, welcoming ambiance, and fresh, flavorful food — delivering real value for the whole family,” said Gustavo Assumpção, co-founder and partner at 4×4 Capital, who will serve as executive board chair. “We look forward to partnering with Mickey and the team to maximize long-term growth.”",

    "description": "Matt Weston cements his status as the best skeleton racer in the world, making history by winning Olympic gold in emphatic fashion in Cortina and securing Team GB’s first medal of the 2026 Winter Games.",
    "fullText": "Standing at the top of the winding Cortina sliding track with Olympic gold in his sights, Matt Weston knew what he had to do.\n\nHaving laid the foundations for skeleton gold on Thursday - tidying up errors from his first run to produce a statement second, each time setting the track record - the Briton merely needed more of the same on Friday.\n\nWhat he produced was not only a masterclass in sliding but also a remarkable display of composure and focus to clinch gold - Team GB's first medal of the Games - and cement his place at the top of the sport.\n\n\"It means everything. It means a hell of a lot to me personally, I've worked so hard for this,\" Weston told BBC Sport.\n\n\"But everyone back home - my fiancee, my family, my friends, everyone who has sacrificed everything for this. I've missed funerals, birthdays, everything for this moment. It feels amazing. Hopefully I made you proud.\"\n\nWeston set a track record on all four of his runs and could have eased off in his final attempt having already built a significant margin of 0.39 seconds, but ramped things up on what was ultimately a victory lap lasting 55.61secs, finishing with a sensational overall time of 3:43.33.\n\nIt left an almost impossible task for the chasing pack and Germany's Axel Jungk finished 0.88secs behind to take silver, while compatriot and defending Olympic champion Christopher Grotheer secured bronze, 1.07secs behind Weston.\n\nThe pressure to deliver was there. The 28-year-old from Redhill was the heavy favourite to top the podium in Italy having dominated the sport in the past four-year cycle, but no British man had won an Olympic skeleton gold medal before.\n\nHe also carried the weight of Team GB teetering on the edge of overall disappointment at the Games, having been tipped for a record medal haul at Milan-Cortina but watching those ambitions begin to slip away.\n\nWeston blocked out the noise of 'helmet-gate', of seeing his peer Vladyslav Heraskevych disqualified from the competition just moments before the first heat, and of the disaster that was Beijing 2022, where GB failed to win a skeleton medal for the first time since 2002.\n\nHe put it all aside to add the Olympic crown to his two World Championship titles and three Crystal Globes - the overall World Cup trophies.\n\nFour years ago, it was a different story.\n\nHis overwhelming disappointment at missing out on the Olympic podium almost led to him quitting the sport and he told BBC Sport earlier this year he has had to teach himself to \"love the pressure and expectation\".\n\nFrom speaking to friends and family to knowing when to rest and eating lots of pasta, Weston has figured out the secret to his own success, and now he's reaping the rewards.\n\nThe new champion knows what it feels like to walk away from an Olympics empty-handed, having finished 15th at his maiden Games in Beijing.\n\nKnowing he did not want to feel that again, he has worked on switching his mentality and says that has paved the way for his success.\n\nIn 2023 he became Britain's first men's world champion in 15 years, taking silver the following year but reclaiming his title in 2025.\n\nHis first World Cup title came in 2024 and he has been unrivalled since, earlier this year becoming the first man to defend the trophy twice - winning five of the seven races this season and finishing second in the other two.\n\nArriving at this Games as reigning world, European and World Cup champion, the pressure was on to deliver.\n\n\"I have taught myself to love the pressure and love the expectation I have on my shoulders,\" Weston told BBC Sport after run two on Thursday.\n\n\"I didn't like it when I first had success, but now I have turned it into fire that I can go out and give my best.\"\n\nHe represented England at taekwondo as a teenager, winning various medals at national level, but a back injury brought that particular sporting career to an end.\n\nHe was also a gifted rugby player but, like many skeleton racers, it was through a talent identification programme that Weston discovered his love and aptitude for the winter sport nine years ago.\n\nQuickly rising up the sport came with its own issues and, following that disappointing result four years ago, Weston had to learn to embrace the pressure and, once winning became the norm, carry the weight of being the favourite.\n\nThat attitude has served him well in Italy as he has been able to block out the noise, pointing to enjoyment as the key to his success.\n\nIt has not just been on the track where Weston has blocked out the noise.\n\nThe build-up to the Olympic event was dominated by discussion around the British team's desire to a wear a new helmet design in Italy.\n\nThey ultimately lost an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), banning them from wearing their new helmet.\n\nWeston and team-mate Marcus Wyatt, who was also tipped for success but finished ninth, were confident it would not make a difference, pointing to the triumphs they have enjoyed all season.\n\nThat came before Weston saw Ukrainian Heraskevych disqualified moments before the men's competition started on Thursday.\n\nAnd after a week of no medals for the British team in Italy, pressure on Weston gradually increased.\n\nBut he knew what he needed to do to win gold, stating he would settle for nothing less in Cortina.\n\nThat doesn't always mean being the first to arrive at the track and the last to leave.\n\nHe sat out Wednesday's final training runs in favour of a rest, opting for some light stretching and mental respite by speaking to his fiance about anything other than sliding.\n\nPlus, eating a lot of pasta, abiding by his motto \"pasta makes you faster\".\n\nUltimately, skeleton training is tricky, particularly for a British athlete.\n\nWith no ice tracks in Britain - only a push-start track at the University of Bath - a lot of time is spent in the gym working on speed and explosiveness to improve that all-important start.\n\nWith one run down the icy track taking less than a minute, it means the British sliders spend around two and a half hours per year actually completing runs and a lot of time visualising the track, understanding the twists and turns to make for a seamless run.\n\nBut Weston has got his rituals down to a tee and not only is he the first British man to win winter gold since Christopher Dean topped the ice dancing podium alongside Jayne Torvill in 1984, but also the first British man to win skeleton gold.\n\nHis success may not end there, as he partners Amelia Coltman in the mixed team event, newly introduced for Milan-Cortina, on Sunday.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Tottenham Hotspur are searching for a new manager following the dismissal of Thomas Frank.\n\nThe Danish tactician was never the right fit at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nHis route-one style of play was not the ideal tactical approach for a team that wants to play front-foot football.\n\nWith Frank’s chapter at Spurs now closed, the North London club must ensure it does not get it wrong with its next pick.\n\nTottenham’s decision-making at the top hasn’t really inspired confidence, but if they pick the wrong man, it could set the club back for years.\n\nTottenham need a forward-thinking, tactically grounded, and experienced figure to turn the tide and return the club to the upper echelons of the Premier League.\n\nThe former Brighton & Hove Albion manager is a well-respected tactician who has shown he can deliver attacking football.\n\n“His sides have a strong identity; they play really good football,” coaching great Carlo Ancelotti said regarding De Zerbi (via Football Italia).\n\nAnother legendary coach, Pep Guardiola, had also lauded De Zerbi, calling him one of the coaches he admires most in world football.\n\nDe Zerbi famously led Brighton to the Europa League and earned plaudits for his work with the Seagulls.\n\nHis tenure in Marseille ended poorly, but his first season with the club was quite memorable.\n\nThis Tottenham squad is crying out for De Zerbi’s tactical nuance after looking inept under Ange Postecoglou and Frank.\n\nThe 46-year-old is the kind of forward-thinking hire the club needs.\n\nThe idea of Mauricio Pochettino should be shelved. Nostalgia should not rule such an important decision.\n\nDe Zerbi is the way to go, and Spurs should be doing everything to get him to sign on the dotted line.\n\nEven if he is not keen on taking on a new job immediately, Spurs must find an interim to hold the seat for him until the end of the season.",

    "fullText": "Bruce Mouat recovered from his Winter Olympics mixed doubles disappointment in some style, delivering an accomplished display to lead his Team GB men's rink to a 9-4 victory in their opening match against China.\n\nLittle more than 24 hours earlier, Mouat and Jen Dodds had faltered in the bronze-medal match in the Cortina Curling Stadium for the second successive Games.\n\nBut the 31-year-old showed why he is considered one of the world's best, as the gold-medal favourites started strongly in their attempt to upgrade the silver they won in Beijing four years ago.\n\nThe Scots, world champions in three of the past five years, traded points with China in the opening two ends, before a classily compiled three in the third cleaved open an advantage that they would never cede.\n\nThey led 5-2 at the break, then a magnificent double take-out and composed closing throw by Mouat extended the advantage to 8-3 after seven.\n\nA judicious set of throws limited the Chinese to one in the eighth but GB closed down the ninth end, taking one to force a round of handshakes with an end to spare.\n\nIt always looked like being a mismatch and so it proved.

    "description": "Oscar nominees gathered for a luncheon to celebrate the coming awards. Some walked the red carpet in high-fashion looks, while others missed the mark.",
    "fullText": "Hollywood is gearing up for the 2026 Oscars in style.\n\nThe Academy Awards aren't until March, but on Tuesday, the 2026 nominees gathered at the Beverly Hilton Hotel for the Oscar Nominees Luncheon.\n\nMany of the stars of the year's biggest movies looked giddy as they walked the red carpet for the event, celebrating their nominations.\n\nHowever, some stars' outfits for the event were more stylish than others. Take a look at the best and worst looks of the luncheon.\n\nChalamet's blue Givenchy suit worked in theory, as he gave it a slightly more casual feel by wearing no tie, unbuttoning his sleeves, and leaving one of the double-breasted buttons undone.\n\nHowever, the suit ended up looking a bit disheveled, particularly because its oversize fit swallowed Chalamet's frame. The \"Marty Supreme\" nominee could have pulled off the wider fit if he had styled it more formally, or he could have worn a slimmer fit with the same relaxed styling.\n\nTaylor continued her slew of stylish red-carpet looks with an all-black ensemble from Cong Tri.\n\nThe bodice featured an unbuttoned blouse made of a leather-like material that cinched at her waist before flowing into a semi-sheer, floor-length skirt. She brought some fun to the look with a sequin-covered coat, which she wore on her shoulders.\n\nThe actor is a first-time Oscars nominee for her performance in \"One Battle After Another.\"\n\nHudson's bright-red gown from Lanvin was a great choice for the luncheon, with an Old Hollywood feel from its sleeveless, boat neckline and ruching at the waistline. Her sideswept hair played up the aesthetic.\n\nHowever, the \"Song Sung Blue\" nominee's accessories detracted from the look. Her black belt, black gloves, and white-and-black shoes just didn't fit the dress' glamorous feel.\n\nSwapping the accessories for subtler options would have allowed the dress to shine more.\n\nThe \"Sinners\" nominee walked the luncheon red carpet in a Balenciaga suit with David Yurman accessories.\n\nHis double-breasted suit had a subtle twill pattern, and he wore it with a black tank top instead of a button-down to dress it down a bit.\n\nA red floral brooch brought a pop of color to Jordan's ensemble.\n\nEjae, who is Oscar-nominated for her song \"Golden\" from \"KPop Demon Hunters,\" wore a cream suit to the luncheon.\n\nHer pinstripe blazer and pants both had a long look, and she paired them with a slightly darker polka dot top. She wore the shirt unbuttoned, revealing a lacy bustier.\n\nSnakeskin shoes, a brooch, and simple earrings tied the look together.\n\nThe \"Weapons\" actor chose a silver Thom Browne suit, which consisted of a jacket, high-waisted pants, and a tie. All three pieces were covered in a floral pattern that shimmered on the red carpet. She paired the suit with a white blouse, gray-and-white shoes, and tinted glasses.\n\nAlthough the floral pattern was pretty, the blazer, pants, and tie together looked overwhelming. If Madigan had paired the jacket and tie with simpler pants, they may have worked better together.\n\nNominated for her performance in \"Bugonia,\" Stone walked the red carpet in a black minidress from Julie de Libran couture.\n\nThe dress mimicked the shape of a blazer, with a plunging neckline lined with lapels and pockets on either side of her hips. A large rosette sat at the center of the low neckline, and Stone added more feminine details with sheer black tights and strappy heels.",

    "description": "Dress pants are a must-have menswear staple, whether you wear them daily or not. The best pairs for men are timeless in style and comfortable to wear.",
    "fullText": "The best dress pants for men should look clean and sophisticated, whether worn in a business casual setting, on date night, or at a social event. They should also be comfortable and easy to clean. Great dress pants are a critical part of any wardrobe, because even the most stylish dress shirt needs a strong supporting cast.\n\nOur favorite pair is from Mizzen+Main, a menswear brand we love for its comfortable and stretchy office clothes. The Mizzen+Main Helmsman Chino pants are stretchy, lightweight, and breathable, while still looking traditional, which makes them ideal for warmer summer weather. Below, we've rounded up the best dress pants for men, an essential element in any workwear wardrobe.\n\nLightweight takes on a whole new meaning with these airy, four-way stretch pants you've got to try on to believe.\n\nThis versatile pair of chinos features invisible side seams and an elastic waist in dense cotton twill that is wrinkle and dust resistant.\n\nThe Gamechanger Rec Pant is as stretchy and comfortable as your favorite sweatpants, but looks like traditional dress pants.\n\nLightweight takes on a whole new meaning with these airy, four-way stretch pants you've got to try on to believe.\n\nEven the best dress pants can sometimes feel cumbersome in extreme heat, but Mizzen + Main seems to have the right response figured out. Featuring a four-way stretch blend of polyester and spandex that feels light as air and breathes easily, the Helmsman Chinos are incredibly comfortable, while retaining the polished look of a traditional five-pocket chino. They're also designed to resist wrinkles, which is great for staying sharp all day long. All of that, plus the added benefit of many colors available, makes them the best we've tested — especially if you want to fill out your wardrobe for the work week.\n\nThis versatile pair of chinos features invisible side seams and an elastic waist in dense cotton twill that is wrinkle and dust resistant.\n\nUniqlo is known for its stylish staples at affordable prices, and the Slim-Fit Chinos are no different. They feature side-seam detailing, like classic dress pants, plus a relatively tailored slim-straight cut. We also love that Uniqlo offers free alterations if the off-the-rack sizing needs to be tweaked to your liking. While they're not as stretchy or wrinkle-resistant as performance pairs, they're comfortable enough for daily wears, and the price tag makes it easy to buy multiple pairs at once.\n\nThe Gamechanger Rec Pant is as stretchy and comfortable as your favorite sweatpants, but looks like traditional dress pants.\n\nPublic Rec's Gamechanger Rec Pants are designed to be as comfortable as sweatpants, but with specific waist and inseam sizes, they'll fit perfectly like dress pants. The material is incredibly stretchy, which is excellent for mobility, comfort, and resisting wrinkles. If you've been looking for the cheat code to wearing sweatpants to your corporate office, this is it.\n\nRead our full review of the Public Rec Gamechanger Rec Pant.\n\nMade with 100% wool, the Lakeshore pants feature a slim fit with a timeless pinstriped pattern.\n\nWool can sometimes be famously uncomfortable, but The Tie Bar's Lakeshore Pants feature a brushed finish that keeps them soft and comfortable against the skin. The streamlined cut through the hips and thighs keeps the look modern and flattering without being too tight for most men. The striped pattern leans into the classic satorial styling, but leaves room for more casual alternative outfits. If you are going for a fully polished look, you can pair them with The Tie Bar's Lakeshore Jacket for an affordably priced, complete suit.\n\nDress pants remained essentially unchanged for years, often made of classic wool, until  Ministry of Supply came along and changed the game. They've quite literally engineered a new way to think about dress pants, using wrinkle-resistant, 4-way stretch fabric boasting next-level features like natural odor control. Yet, they still feature timeless dress pant details like front slash pockets and two clean, sharp fit options. They should be comfortable enough for all-day wear and even business travel.\n\nRead more about the Ministry of Supply in our review of the best work clothes for men,\n\nSome dress pants separate themselves from the pack with a super-crisp design. In fact, it's hard not to love sharp, dressy, creased-front pants. The BOSS brand and its subsets, like the Genius line, specialize in these. Wool fabric is elevated even further with a comfortable stretch, turning these into comfortable pants fit for day-to-night wear.\n\nIndochino is known for its custom, made-to-measure menswear. You've got the world of premium tailored style at your fingertips, so to speak, with customizable options from Indochino. It's easier and more efficient than ever to add a little flair to your rotation of the best dress pants for men, with customizable fabric and lining options available. And seeing as these pants already come in Indochino's excellent cashmere blend, you're already starting at a proper jumping-off point.\n\nThe Apparel Skyline Pants are an eye-catching take on classic men's dress pants.\n\nY.Chroma Apparel is all about reimagining what you thought you knew about menswear. The brand is bold and vibrant, taking cues from surf and skate culture yet putting a refined spin on those typically youthful pursuits. That approach manifests itself in the visually appealing Skyline Pants, which are classic enough to wear with chunky leather loafers and edgy enough to wear with beat-up dress boots. They're stitched in Bulgaria from a blend of cotton and Italian elastane, and Y.Chroma's color selection is simply immaculate.\n\nSqueezing into suit pants or finding dress pants that fit was once a chore for guys with larger thighs and a more athletic build. And yet, State and Liberty was founded with a laser-sharp focus on solving that problem, from blazers to dress shirts and these expertly cut dress pants. The performance-blend fabric moves with you and offers a tapered fit with plenty of room (but not too much), while these can easily be paired with a State and Liberty blazer for a cool, tailored look.\n\nIs it possible for a pair of the best dress pants to actually be, well — more casual? In the hands of Mugsy, the answer is a resounding yes. The brand's thin wale stretch corduroy boasts the eye-catching texture of corduroy, but the lightweight stretch fabric makes them a reliable option for chilly fall and winter days, too. Plus, the five-pocket design and washed-out colorway are both slightly more laidback if you prefer a pair of dress pants with a (slightly) more easygoing look.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

    "fullText": "Manchester United have won four games on the bounce under Michael Carrick, something the team never managed under former head coach Ruben Amorim.\n\nMichael Carrick has restored the club’s DNA, with the Red Devils winning games late on while breaking down stubborn defences with ease.\n\nThe manner of the four victories and the opposition they have come against have impressed one and all, including United players.\n\nHarry Maguire was asked about what Carrick got right instantly as opposed to the Portuguese, and the former skipper pointed to the work rate put in by the players as a unit while defending.\n\nHe cited the team’s defending in the box, claiming the 20-time English league champions are far more aggressive now as compared to under Amorim.\n\n“I think we’ve got to be comfortable to be dominant with the ball but also without the ball and also be a threat,’ Maguire told TNT Sports. “We also know we’re going to be a threat on the counter-attack with our players.\n\n“Taking the lead against Manchester City and then we were happy to soak up a little bit of pressure and be comfortable defending our box.\n\n“I think that’s the main thing that’s improved over the last three games. We’ve defended our box a lot better with a lot more urgency. Previously we defended our box nowhere near good enough, every time the ball went in the box they had a chance.\n\n“But the last three games, loads more urgency. Not just from the defenders, from the midfielders, the wide men getting back in, the strikers protecting the edge of the box, I think it’s so important we do it as a team.”\n\nThe most important change has been United’s tactical flexibility, as opposed to playing in Amorim’s rigid 3-4-3 system.\n\nUnder the former United midfielder, the Old Trafford side have played a fluid front four, while playing in a different way in each game.\n\nUnited defended narrow against Manchester City and Arsenal, while looking to play on the counter. It was a different approach against both Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur, where they enjoyed more of the ball.\n\n“We’ve got to make sure we get the spaces right all over the pitch. We’ve got to make sure we’re compact, in a mid block, a low block or we go after teams.\n\n“I’m sure under Sir Alex [Ferguson] you went after some teams and you were happy in the mid block and happy defending low. I think Michael will bring that.I think there’ll be times going man-for-man all over the pitch and be really aggressive.\n\n“There’ll also be times we’ll be happy and content keeping the spaces short and punishing teams on the counter-attack. I think it’s important to be tactically flexible.”\n\nUnited will now look to make it five wins out of five when they travel to London to face West Ham United later on Tuesday.\n\nFeature image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "As a personal stylist, I've noticed wealthy clients rarely have things like fast fashion or overpriced designer basics in their wardrobes and closets.",
    "fullText": "As a personal stylist, my clients represent a range of incomes, ages, and phases of life.\n\nI help everyone from twentysomethings trying to appear more professional in the office to older clients needing a packing list for their next luxurious vacation.\n\nTheir budgets range and so do their closets — I've been in cluttered dumpster fires and ones so minimal they're almost sterile.\n\nOver the years, though, I've noticed a few patterns with how wealthier clients shop and curate their wardrobes. For one, there are a few things I never see in their closets.\n\nMy wealthier clients approach shopping much like investing: strategically.\n\nBecause of this, they'll usually skip fast fashion in favor of high-quality pieces made from luxe fabrics that are designed to last years, even decades.\n\nIf you have to keep replacing something, you'll end up spending more money in the long run.\n\nOftentimes, a well-made staple's higher price can amortize to pennies per wear. Meanwhile, a $10 sweater may not be such a great deal if it only survives a few washes.\n\nOne thing many of my wealthiest clients have in common is that they shop with intention. Even those who could afford to buy anything would be appalled if I suggested a \"Pretty Woman\"-style shopping spree.\n\nIn my experience, this means they're not prone to impulse buying or shopping sale racks.\n\nInstead, they think about the upcoming months and what they are actually going to need and realistically wear. A new pair of jeans for fall? A light jacket for an upcoming trip?\n\nIf an item is on sale, it's a bonus, but they're not buying something simply because it's discounted.\n\nFor them, shopping is often practical and strategic. The goal is to know what you like and find the thing you sought out to purchase.\n\nThey aren't buying outfits that fit an imaginary life they could one day have or dresses for occasions that haven't been planned yet.\n\nIt's a lesson any of us could benefit from learning: Know what you need before you go shopping and make sure you have a clear idea of when you'll wear something before taking it home.\n\nThat way, you can feel comfortable snipping the price tag off of a piece before it even enters your closet.\n\nSome designer labels sell plain T-shirts that cost hundreds of dollars, sometimes even over $1,000 a pop.\n\nHowever, I haven't found many of them in my clients' closets because they recognize that great basics don't have to be expensive and style can be had at every price point.\n\nSo, they often have a few more affordable staples mixed in with their designer pieces.\n\nIn my experience, even the wealthiest shoppers aren't above a \"mall brand.\" It's not uncommon for them to pair their four-figure leather jacket with a Gap tee or J. Crew sweater.\n\nI've noticed many of my high-end clients are open to editing their wardrobes, even if they have plenty of empty closet space.\n\nIt's rare for them to hold onto tops from college or jeans that haven't fit in a decade \"just in case.\" They don't keep a garment just because \"it's perfectly good\" or \"there's nothing wrong with it.\"\n\nInstead, pieces are in their closet because they wear them and enjoy doing so. This is a good reminder that it's OK to say goodbye to clothes that no longer fit or that haven't been worn in a long time.\n\nTrends may come back around, but just as we grow and change through different seasons and eras of life, our clothes should, too.\n\nIt's common for these clients to have a roster of people who can help keep their favorite pieces in ready-to-wear condition.\n\nThey often have a go-to tailor who can adjust the fit of clothing, a cobbler who can repair footwear, and a mender who can fix zippers.\n\nInstead of tossing worn dress shoes, they'll get them resoled. Rather than never wearing a blouse that always gapes, they'll have a snap sewn in.\n\nOnce again, these clients love a good investment. Mindful repairs can extend the life of clothing and shoes while also making them more comfortable and easier to wear.",

The scene then shifts inside the aircraft, where a voice announces that the plane is “flying over the Gulf of America.” A screeching eagle sound effect follows as the video rapidly transitions to the White House, cutting through a montage of President Donald Trump signing executive orders. “We bet on ourselves and don’t apologize for winning,” the narrator continues.",

LSU is 22-3 on the year and 4-3 in games vs. quad one opponents, meaning all of their losses have been to Q1 teams. LSU is 3-0 vs. quad two opponents and 3-0 vs. quad three opponents.\n\nLSU beat Auburn 77-44 on Sunday, bouncing back after the Tigers fell at Texas last week. Freshman ZaKiyah Johnson led the way for LSU with 16 points. MiKaylah Williams also scored in double-digits.\n\nLSU's net ranking indicates the Tigers are still in play for a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. March is approaching, but the Tigers still have several chances to build their resume while already having a few signature wins under their belt.\n\nLSU's next game is a big one as the Tigers will host South Carolina in Baton Rouge on Saturday. LSU has all week to prepare as they search for an elusive victory over Dawn Staley's Gamecocks.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: Where LSU women's basketball stands in updated NET rankings",

    "description": "You don't usually expect restaurant-style service at 35,000 feet — but Turkish still staffs a 'flying chef' in business class on its longest routes.",
    "fullText": "You don't usually expect restaurant-style service at 35,000 feet — but Turkish Airlines still staffs a 'flying chef' in business class on its longest routes.\n\nThese rare culinary specialists, who are separate from flight attendants, take food orders, plate meals in the galley, and oversee premium service on long-haul flights.\n\nThe role is designed to make dining feel closer to a restaurant than standard airline catering — but chefs don't actually cook from scratch due to flight safety rules. They use ovens to heat and finish pre-prepared meals and then arrange the presentation.\n\nThese chefs also take customer feedback from the air to help improve and develop meals in catering kitchens on the ground.\n\nI recently experienced the unique service on a 10-hour flight from Istanbul to New York in January. Considering Turkish won Skytrax's 2025 awards for Europe's best business class and best business class catering, I was eager to see how the seat and food measured up.\n\nI strategically chose the Boeing 787 for its modern business cabin; the Boeing 777 that also flies the route doesn't have the nicer design.\n\nBetween the lie-flat seat, the large TV, and the restaurant-style meals, the cabin felt like my living room on a lazy Saturday night.\n\nI slept well and appreciated the wide variety of food, from poached eggs and swordfish to a trolley full of savory appetizers.\n\nHere's what the full experience was like. Business Insider paid a media rate for the business class upgrade to New York.\n\nTurkish's Istanbul business class lounge is unreal, with cooked-to-order meals like omelettes and kebabs, drink stations, and sleep suites that feel like mini hotel rooms.\n\nMy layover time qualified me for a suite, but they're first-come, first-served — I was lucky to wait only about 15 minutes.\n\nThe bed was so comfortable I slept five hours straight, with a shared bathroom and shower just across the hall.\n\nI chose seat 8A, in the last row, for privacy and to be among the first to deplane. Although it's right by the galley and lavatory nearest the boarding door, I didn't notice much noise with headphones on.\n\nMost Turkish business cabins don't have doors. Some A350s do, and the airline is planning a new \"Crystal Business Class\" with sliding doors, but most planes — including the 787 I flew on — still don't.\n\nIt's not a dealbreaker by any means, and the seat wings help cocoon the space a bit, but there is less overall privacy than with a door.\n\nThe business class seats lie fully flat, and mine felt both spacious and cozy. I could comfortably sleep on my stomach, and I particularly liked the mattress pad and the dual-texture blanket, which has a soft plush on one side.\n\nI also appreciated the 1-2-1 cabin that let me freely reach the aisle. Many of Turkish's old planes still have 2-3-2 layouts that force middle and window-seat travelers to crawl over their neighbor to reach the restroom.\n\nThe seat had multiple storage spots: a cabinet, a footrest cubby, and a slim seatback pocket — plus an overhead bin to myself.\n\nI stashed my purse, Kindle, chargers, boots, backpack, and jacket without feeling cramped.\n\nThe seat's television was large and fully controllable via a handheld remote. I watched \"The Big Bang Theory,\" \"Fast and Furious,\" and an Agatha Christie-style whodunit called \"Murder at the Embassy.\"\n\nInstead of a flight attendant, a dedicated flying chef takes orders, plates meals, and preps appetizer and dessert carts.\n\nMost of the menu — like meats and soups — are fully or nearly fully cooked on the ground in airline kitchens, but finished in the air by the chef and cabin crew using onboard ovens.\n\nThe cabin crew still hands out drinks and hot towels, but with meals covered, I imagine they can better focus on other tasks.\n\nAll of the food was served on real dishware and with flatware — no cheap plastic.\n\nTurkish offers a \"dining-on-demand\" strategy that lets passengers choose when they want to eat.\n\nFor example, I slept a few hours after breakfast before requesting tea, though the crew member also brought me a small sandwich. It was simple — handcrafted with a roll, lettuce, and cheese — but perfect while I watched a movie.\n\nThere were also free snacks available throughout the flight, like popcorn, fruit, mixed nuts, chocolate, cookies, and chips.\n\nThe breakfast started with appetizers: fresh juice, fruit salad, cheeses, smoked turkey, marinated olives, and bread with butter and jam.\n\nThe entrée options included poached eggs with a savory sauce called shakshuka, spinach-and-cheese stuffed pastries and flatbreads (börek and gözleme), and sweet curd crepes with fruit and berry sauce.\n\nI had the poached eggs, which were prepared on the ground but were still fluffy with a perfectly runny yolk on the plane.\n\nThe second meal included a huge range of appetizers: octopus salad, salmon tartare, shrimp salad, artichoke salad, fried aubergine, beef patties, chicken salad, cheese, red pepper soup, creamy pea soup, and Köpoğlu (essentially Turkish eggplant caviar).\n\nEverything was arranged on a trolley by the chef and rolled down the galley for passengers to pick and choose; the presentation made the experience feel more fancy, and everything was tasty.\n\nBesides Turkish, select Saudia, Austrian Airlines, and Garuda Indonesia flights feature onboard chefs.\n\nTurkish's chefs, staffed through catering partner DO&CO, also spend time at meal-prep facilities, providing feedback and helping maintain quality — a hands-on approach that shows in the in-flight service.\n\nI rarely check luggage, but I had too many souvenirs this time.\n\nLuckily, my bag survived the transfer from Zagreb, Croatia, and arrived in New York safe and sound.",

    "description": "From bold red carpets to headline-making performances, take a look at Bad Bunny's best and worst fashion moments over the years.",
    "fullText": "Bad Bunny is headlining the Super Bowl Halftime Show on Sunday, and fans are eager to see how his outfit might play a role in the production.\n\nSince his 2016 debut, Bad Bunny has established himself as a fearless fashion icon, often talking about how central his style is to who he is in songs like \"Yo Visto Así,\" where he sings, \"I wear what I want, I won't change / If you don't like it, you don't have to look.\"\n\nWhile the singer's unapologetic fashion style has been one of the many things that's helped him become a worldwide superstar, his fashion evolution tells a story of experimentation … and the unavoidable mistakes that come with it.\n\nAs we prepare to see the singer take the stage at the Super Bowl this Sunday, take a look back at some of his most iconic looks through the years, starting with his best.\n\nHis third Met Gala appearance — and first serving as a co-chair for the event — was among the best and most acclaimed.\n\nThe singer wore a custom Maison Margiela Artisanal suit designed by John Galliano that stood out for its theatrical flair.\n\nIt included a navy suit with white stitching detail, a dark floral fabric bouquet, and a surreal sculptural hat that reflected the fashion house's avant-garde style. The outfit also included leather gloves, geometric sunglasses, and a horse-like pair of Margiela's signature Tabi shoes.\n\nThe look was commended as one of the night's best and cemented the singer's growing presence as a menswear icon.\n\nDuring his headlining set at Coachella in 2023, the singer wore a maximalist custom ERL patchwork puffer jacket and matching pants. The outfit was full of overly saturated, busy patterns that included florals, stripes, and plaid.\n\nThe eccentric and colorful look matched the show's stadium-level production and high-energy setlist as he performed songs from his 2022 summer album, \"Un Verano Sin Ti.\"\n\nAt the 2023 Met Gala, Bad Bunny wore a custom all-white Jacquemus suit with a cutout back and a dangling \"J\" as a nod to the look's designer. It also featured a dramatic, 26-foot-long rosette cape.\n\nThe outfit was spot-on for the event, which honored the late Karl Lagerfeld, and broke away from traditional menswear choices, becoming one of the most talked-about looks of the night.\n\nFor his debut at the Grammy Awards, Bad Bunny went for an outfit that was playful without feeling gimmicky.\n\nThe singer wore an all-black Burberry look, which he paired with a hat resembling bunny ears and tinted sunglasses.\n\nIn contrast to the simple, monochromatic outfit, he carried a bright sunflower, which added to the look's playfulness and served as a nod to the more colorful, adventurous fashion choices he'd become known for.\n\nAlthough simple, the sunflower detail was one of the most talked-about accessories of the night. \"Bad Bunny's fully bloomed sunflower has managed to make my heart swell,\" wrote Vogue's Liana Satenstein.\n\nIf we go back in Bad Bunny style history, there are certain moments that stand out … and not in a good way. His floral Gucci suit at the 2017 Latin American Music Awards is one of them.\n\nThe then-up-and-coming artist wore a loud floral suit, paired with bedazzled, tinted sunglasses and excessive diamond jewelry, including grills and layered necklaces. The suit also had embroidered details on the lapel, which were accentuated by flower details, and diamond buttons.\n\nWhile the singer — who had a buzzcut back then — might look almost unrecognizable in this look, it signaled his strong sense of style right at the beginning of his career.\n\nBut does that make it a good look? Well …\n\nAnother early look from the Puerto Rican singer shared some of the same qualities: It was a bright, unique look.\n\nBad Bunny wore a shiny purple suit with metallic fabrics, embroidered details, and gems along the lapel edges. He wore it with an equally shiny metallic shirt underneath, a large diamond cross necklace, and lilac sunglasses.\n\nWhile it was certainly a daring look, there was just too much going on, unlike the more pared-down, chic looks he would later wear.\n\nWhile Bad Bunny's performance with Marc Anthony and Will Smith at the 19th annual Latin Grammy Awards brought energy to the night, fashion-wise, it was a bit confusing.\n\nWhile Anthony stuck with his classic black-and-white suit, Smith opted for a sparkly black jacket and shirt for the stage. Bad Bunny, on the other hand, chose an outfit that was more of a reflection of the times' quickly fading trends, worn all at once.\n\nHe wore silver pleather pants, a zebra-print shirt, and a burgundy velvet bomber jacket, along with pink sunglasses, for the performance.\n\nOnstage, the look felt out of place with his collaborators' style choices. It also probably started looking dated about 15 minutes after the performance ended.\n\nThe singer wore a loud Louis Vuitton matching outfit at his 2019 Coachella performance, pairing the oversized ensemble with visor-style lenses that covered most of his face.\n\nThe outfit was covered in pastel rainbow logos, leaving little room for mistaking the look for another designer's.\n\nTo accept the award for best urban music album at the Latin Grammys for his debut album \"X 100Pre,\" Bad Bunny wore a look that combined multiple patterns and color palettes.\n\nThe singer wore a mismatching short-sleeve button-down shirt and plaid shorts with a zip-up turtle-neck-like collar, a black bucket hat, dark sunglasses, and Gucci knee pads.\n\nThe outfit matched the singer's 2018 album title \"Yo Hago Lo Que Me Da La Gana,\" which translates to \"I do whatever I want.\"",

    "description": "New York Giants LB Kayvon Thibodeaux is a big fan of John Harbaugh's old-school, no BS style of coaching.",
    "fullText": "New York Giants linebacker Kayvon Thibodeaux is embracing the arrival of new head coach John Harbaugh, praising his \"old-school\" coaching style as a much-needed reset for the team.\n\nDuring Super Bowl week in San Francisco, Thibodeaux made inquiries about Harbaugh, speaking with \"a few older guys\" who had played under him in Baltimore. The feedback reinforced Harbaugh's reputation as a strict, no-nonsense leader who \"knows football and he loves football.\"\n\nThibodeaux expressed enthusiasm for the straightforward approach.\n\n\"I always like when you pass a certain age, you don’t have to sugarcoat what you say, you’re just kinda straightforward, white and black,\" Thibodeaux said, via the New York Post. \"You see a lot of different cultures, different people that want to sometimes change their ways for the new generation or they want to fit in or whatever the case may be.\n\n\"For me, specifically, I like old-school coaches because they just take no (expletive), black and white, you know what you’re gonna get every day. I think with a lot of young guys that we have, I think it’s gonna be good for him to really get it in order.\"\n\nThis comes after an earlier denial in January, when Thibodeaux dismissed suggestions on social media that Giants players were calling around about Harbaugh, responding to team legend Carl Banks: \"Nobody's doing this, Carl. Effort was never the problem.\"\n\nHis recent comments show he has since actively sought insights into the coach hired to turn around the franchise following seasons of inconsistency.\n\nThibodeaux, who had his fifth-year option picked up, remains optimistic about the defense under new coordinator Dennard Wilson and is relieved that position coach Charlie Bullen was retained... For now.\n\nAfter a 2025 season cut short by injury, Thibodeaux is cleared medically and eager to thrive in Harbaugh's structured environment.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Giants' Kayvon Thibodeaux loves John Harbaugh's 'old-school' coaching style",

    "fullText": "Manchester United under Michael Carrick have won four in a row, something Ruben Amorim never managed during his 18-month spell in charge of the club.\n\nApart from the results, the style of play under the caretaker head coach has impressed fans, as has the never-say-die attitude displayed by the team.\n\nAnd on Saturday, the team also ended their hoodoo against low-blocks, something the Red Devils struggled with under the Portuguese, as seen during the encounter against Everton a few months back.\n\nBruno Fernandes, who scored a brilliant goal against Spurs, was full of praise for the former United midfielder when speaking to TNT Sports.\n\nTaking a not-so-subtle dig at Amorim, the club captain explained that Carrick came with the right ideas and instead of trying to impose something entirely different, he gave the players freedom to express themselves.\n\n“I think Michael came in with the right ideas about giving the players the responsibilities also, but some freedom on the pitch to take decisions that were needed. He is very good with the words.\n\n“I think he still remembers what I told him the last time he was our manager for our last game. And I was sure Michael could be a great manager and he’s just showing it and we hope we can help him even more.\n\n“So everyone can see not just us as players, that we are good players because that is why we are at Manchester United, but also the staff is very good.”\n\nAmorim‘s determination to play with three at the back proved to be a huge detriment to the team as was his shoehorning of players into unusual positions, something Fernandes can relate to.\n\nIt also helps that Carrick knows all about managing expectations at the world’s biggest club, something Amorim clearly was clueless about.\n\nHis negative tactics, and his disastrous man-management almost ruined certain players, but the former England international has helped restore the club’s DNA.\n\n“Everyone understands the pressure of playing for this club. If you don’t understand you start to understand very quickly because this is a massive club and everyone knows the expectations around it.\n\n“I don’t think that changes but obviously Michael has won everything here. He knows what it means for these fans, what it means for this club to win, and how much is needed to win in this football club. I think that adds something special to the team.”\n\nThe 20-time English league champions cannot afford to relax. They have the chance to win five on the trot in midweek as they aim to secure Champions League qualification.\n\nFeature image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "title": "F1 regulation change comes at a good time for younger drivers - Andrea Kimi Antonelli",
    "description": "F1 will introduce widespread regulation changes this year and the style required to race the new cars is vastly different to anything the drivers have experienced before",
    "fullText": "Andrea Kimi Antonelli is confident that Formula 1’s more inexperienced drivers will benefit from the 2026 regulation overhaul due to the need to adapt.\n\nF1 promises to look totally different this year with changes to both the chassis, lighter by 32kg plus less downforce, and engine, more reliant on electric power, after four years of ground effect cars.\n\nThere has been vast talk about how drivers will therefore need to adapt their style due to active aerodynamics and energy management playing a bigger role, with some claiming that the 2026 cars go against everything they were taught in karting.\n\nBut the younger drivers, like those who have only been in F1 since last year, may benefit from this overhaul because they’re already used to constantly changing cars and don’t really have one distinct style of racing to fall back on.\n\nAntonelli is one of those, having been fast-tracked to F1 by never contesting more than one season of a junior championship before making his Mercedes grand prix debut at the age of 18.\n\n“For all the rookies that joined F1 last year, coming into this year with a new car is kind of good, because obviously we've been used to drive a different car every year,” said the Italian teen.\n\n“So we've been used to try and adapt as quickly as possible to a new car. So of course on that side, it's good that we have a new car this year, because it's a reset for everyone. Especially for us, that we've been used to every year to a new car, it's good because we've been used to that. Maybe it will help us out to understand the car a bit quicker than others.”\n\nThe Mercedes driver therefore thinks it levels the playing field as everybody has to start from scratch, as opposed to last season where he came in at perhaps a disadvantage to others.\n\n“This is a massive rule change and it kind of resets everything because everyone has to relearn the car,” he added. “So on that side, it's better because obviously last year was last year's, the last year of the old regulation and most of the drivers, they knew the car very, very well and they've been developing that car.\n\n“While this year is definitely completely new, so on the driving side, it's a big opportunity because whoever understands it the best way and earlier than the others can really make the difference.”\n\nThat isn’t to say, however, that the veterans will struggle and automatically get beaten by the youngsters, because being inexperienced still proved costly for Antonelli last season.\n\nAlthough he impressed on occasions with three podiums and a Miami sprint pole, he also suffered many unforced crashes in practice and sometimes struggled with the pressures of being a highly-rated rookie - his home race at Imola being an example.\n\n“The other drivers are not stupid and they're pretty good,” said the 19-year-old. “So I think they will figure it out very quickly as well.\n\n“Experience still counts. With how you approach the year, every weekend, the experience still helps and because, of course, I've done one year in F1 and I've learned a lot, but this year, definitely I will have a different approach at times, but I feel I still need to learn quite a bit.\n\n“So on the experience side, there will still be a bit of a difference, but on the driving side, I think we're all on the same level now as we have the new car. So I think that is going to be a big, big opportunity.”\n\nMercedes rivals push for intervention over F1 engine loophole - but how realistic is it?\n\nGeorge Russell predicts F1 team most likely to challenge the top four in 2026\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

Here's why they're worth your attention, money, and closet space.\n\nSize range: Varies by style, with most pieces ranging from XXS-XXL or 00-20\n\nM.M. LaFleur has built a cult following by blending style, comfort, and thoughtful design — all with a professional edge. Its pieces are meant to last you from 6 a.m to 9.pm. Without extra effort, and features like adjustable pant hems and smart internal clips actually make a difference in real life.\n\n\"LaFleur designed her blouses with internal clips on the shoulders to keep your bra strap from falling down all day,\" says style editor Samantha Crozier. It's a small consideration, can actually make a difference in real life. You simply won't find that kind of attention to detail if you're relying on Express or H&M for all your workwear.\n\nThe female-founded start up was born in New York and is all about elevated silhouettes that look polished but never stiff. This makes them ideal whether you're networking at an after-hours event or traveling for business. Many fabrics are machine-washable and wrinkle-resistant, which feels like a luxury in itself.\n\nAnother one of our favorite aspects of M.M. LaFleur are its modular designs. Take the Foster Pants, for example. These stretchy work pants have concealed button hems, which lets you shorten or lengthen the inseams. Be sure to also check out its travel-friendly suits, which we found easy to wear right out of a suitcase.\n\nDespite its name, Lilysilk specializes more than just silk. Its polished workwear ensembles are made from some of the highest-quality cashmere we've ever tested, which pairs beautifully with its wool trousers, linen dresses, or luxurious silk crepe pants. \"Lilysilk's natural textiles feel so good on the skin that I've kept them on long after I've signed off for the evening. The little details elevate the whole look, too — think gold-rimmed shell buttons, chiffon-lined dresses, and crisp pleats.\"\n\nIf you're planning a look for a work gala or an important client lunch, we recommend building an outfit from their matching co-ord sets. You can throw them on without much thought and they'll still look effortlessly chic.\n\nSize range: XXS-3X, 0-28\n\nWe're confident that just about anybody can find at least one thing they love from Eileen Fisher. If your workday runs the gamut and you need an outfit that can fit in anywhere, Eileen Fisher's understated, beautifully cut basics will always come in clutch. The heritage brand is known for timeless silhouettes and top-tier fabrics that age gracefully.\n\nThere's a reason stylists keep recommending Eileen Fisher for capsule wardrobes: the clothes are comfortable, well made, size inclusive, and easy to mix and match. Think soft wool knits, breezy trousers, and classic blazers that you can style with what you already have in your closet.\n\n\"It's notable when three generations of women in my family each own one piece from the same clothing brand,\" writes senior associate style editor Gabrielle Chase. \"We all have our own ideas on how to style them, but we all agree Eileen Fisher is the queen of quality textiles.\"\n\nSize range: XS-XL, 0-14 \n\nNot only does Cuyana makes some of our favorite luxury work bags for women, but its \"Fewer, Better\" philosophy aligns exactly with how our editors feel about shopping selectively. \n\nIt's easy to feel overwhelmed scrolling through pages upon pages of clothing items, so Cuyana keeps it simple with a condensed collection of modern, neutral-colored basics. Each one is expensive to be sure, but that's largely due to the certifiably sustainable materials and Cuyana's high standards for ethical production.\n\nFrom its soft, single-origin sweaters to supportive base layers, these shape-shifting workhorses are essential to the modern feminine wardrobe. And if the current collection doesn't pique your fancy, we recommend checking out its Archive Sale for a retrospect into the brand's design evolution.\n\nSize range: Dependent on designer\n\nTuckernuck brings a playful, preppy energy to workwear — think pastel button-downs, tweed Jackie O dresses, and structured shoulders that standout in a conference room. Its curation of designer labels all revolve an East Coast-inspired aesthetic, from household names like Isabel Marant and Polo Ralph Lauren to independent fashion houses like Erdem or Ulla Johnson.\n\nWhile not a traditional workwear brand in the suit-and-blazer sense, Tuckernuck's Workwear Edit proves that its buyers are familiar with the scope of the professional woman's wardrobe, from everyday essentials to floral prints and fun shapes that are sure to earn you some compliments.\n\nIt took some digging around the site, but through Tuckernuck we've discovered some of our favorite work pants for women and work dresses that transition from desk to dinner. If you're shopping its in-house label, check the material composition to be sure you're paying for more than a trendy tag.\n\nSize range: Distinct microsizes in the 00-40 range\n\nLaws of Motion's claim to fame is providing precise fits in a way that doesn't require going to the tailor. It instead uses proprietary data science and AI-driven sizing to pinpoint hundreds of \"microsizes,\" so your work clothes feel nearly custom-made.\n\nTraditional sizing only fits a tiny fraction of bodies well. Laws of Motion remedies that with precision sizing that accounts for shape as much as size, making its workwear staples feel truly tailored. You can find your custom fit with just a 60-second quiz, or do a simple body scan right from your phone.\n\n\"The styles feel modern and powerful — I always feel ready to take on the world in Laws of Motion,\" says freelance writer fashion expert in her guide to the best plus-size workwear. \"I also really appreciate the thoughtful details they incorporate in their designs, like the longer ribbon on the Legend's zipper pull, making it easier to zip up yourself — even if you have short arms like me!\"\n\nIf you're totally new to the brand and skeptical of its unconventional size system, we suggest starting with a blazer. From chic longline versions to cheeky cropped tweed numbers, it has blazers that'll fit full busts, wide shoulders, long torsos, and everyone in between.\n\nEven with relaxed office dress codes, these brands make pieces that can maintain their shape, look sharper on video calls, and last you for years. By spending more on fewer pieces, you're rewarded with higher quality materials, durable construction, and intuitive design details that help you get dressed in a way that looks effortlessly chic.\n\nNot everyone can afford a full closet of luxury workwear, but you can collect enough pieces that'll give the illusion of a C-suite level wardrobe. One strategy is to splurge on foundational items you'll wear frequently (like a tailored blazer or versatile pant) and pair them with more affordable basics. Another is to browse luxury archive sales to get premium pieces at a lower price point without sacrificing quality.\n\nLuxury brands typically offer superior fabrics, unique design features (like adjustable hems or precision fit), and finishes that stand up to repeated wear. You're also going to pay more for brands like Eileen Fisher and Cuyana, which are more transparent about their workers' wages and the lengths they go to source eco-friendly materials. The more ethical the supply chain, the higher the cost.\n\nYou don't necessarily have to reserve these pieces for Monday through Friday. A blazer can be styled more casual with joggers and ankle boots, and even a knit dress can turn cozy with the right accessories. As style editors who prioritize value, we think in terms of \"cost-per-wear,\" meaning the more times you wear a piece, the better the investment. Focus on solid, neutral colors in order to get the most of your luxury workwear.\n\nYes, though it depends on the brand. Before you splurge, know your measurements to a tee so you can compare them to size charts. Some luxury brands are more size-inclusive than others, like Eileen Fisher and Laws of Motion.

    "description": "Melania Trump used to walk red carpets in sparkly, sheer outfits. As first lady, she embraces suits, high-fashion designers, and bold accessories.",
    "fullText": "At a \"Celebrity\" party in 1998, Melania chose a figure-hugging silk dress in periwinkle. Its neckline scooped gently.\n\nMelania arrived at the 1999 Annual Fragrance Foundation Fifi Awards in a form-fitting dress covered entirely in pink sparkles.\n\nThe gown's subtle slit was sexy without being over the top.\n\nShe attended the New York premiere of \"Charlie's Angels\" in a white skirt suit, but added a daring edge to the look with a sheer lace top.\n\nStrappy heels completed her outfit.\n\nWhen she accompanied Donald Trump to the Oscars, Melania wore a form-fitting white dress embellished with sparkly sequins.\n\nThe gown had a V-neckline, which mirrored the slit running up the center of the dress.\n\nBefore her life had political ties, Melania was often spotted in casual looks, like this all-orange ensemble she wore to a Fashion Week show.\n\nShe paired the silk off-the-shoulder top with wide-legged pants that featured a striped pattern and sparkles.\n\nA full skirt accented the gown's form-fitting bodice.\n\nThe black-and-tan dress had a feathered skirt with sheer detailing, and she paired it with coordinating shoes.\n\nTrump proposed to Melania on April 26, 2004, the evening of the Met Gala.\n\nShe paired her 15-carat engagement ring with a black ball gown, which had a corset covered in cutouts.\n\nAttending a Fashion Week event, Melania paired fitted jeans with a sheer pink babydoll top. High heels completed the look.\n\nMelania attended the Night of Stars party in October 2005 when she was expecting Barron Trump.\n\nShe wore an empire-waist black gown to the event, which featured sheer fabric on the neckline and sparkly embellishments.\n\nBlack dresses with sheer detailing became a bit of a uniform for Melania in the early 2000s, as she showed with her dress for the Metropolitan Opera Opening Night Dinner in 2006.\n\nThe silk dress had lace detailing on the sheer bodice and the neckline. Crisscross straps and lace paneling on the skirt added to the sexy gown.\n\nAt the 2007 Met Gala, Melania wore a shiny gold minidress with fabric tassels that swayed as she walked. She paired the look with coordinating gold shoes.\n\nMelania was photographed attending a Fashion Week event in 2007 alongside Donald Trump.\n\nShe wore all-black, and her hat and wrap featured fuzzy detailing. Knee-high boots completed the wintry ensemble.\n\nMelania kept up her streak of eye-catching Met Gala looks in 2008, arriving in a bright-pink, strapless Vera Wang dress.\n\nThe dress had a bow on the neckline and ruffle detailing on its mermaid skirt.\n\nAt the premiere of \"Nine,\" Melania wore a short, long-sleeved dress embroidered with sparkles, which she paired with pointed-toe shoes.\n\nMelania's black cocktail dress had a form-fitting bodice with a subtle sweetheart neckline and spaghetti straps. The dress hit her knees, and she paired it with open-toe shoes.\n\nMelania's black suit was simple, featuring flared pants and a fitted jacket. The top buttons of her white blouse were open, and the sleeves poked out from under the jacket.\n\nBlack, pointed heels complemented the ensemble.\n\nMelania's gray dress for her \"Good Afternoon America\" appearance had a professional feel.\n\nThe fitted dress had a V-neckline and covered her knees, and a black belt cinched her waist. She also wore black heels.\n\nWhen Trump hosted an Invitational Grand Prix at Mar-a-Lago in January 2013, Melania showed that she could nail a dress code.\n\nHer white, sleeveless dress had a scooped neckline and a pleated skirt that felt like an elevated version of a golf ensemble. She added white heels to the look.\n\nThe jumpsuit featured long sleeves, subtly flared pants, and semi-sheer paneling on the bodice adorned with black lace.\n\nBlack heels accented the ensemble.\n\nAfter Trump announced he was running for president in the summer of 2015, he and Melania appeared on \"Barbara Walters Presents: The 10 Most Fascinating People of 2015.\"\n\nMelania chose a simple pink dress with short sleeves and a modest neckline for the interview. Her pink, pointed shoes matched the dress.\n\nLauren A. Rothman, a style strategist and image coach, told Business Insider that Melania seemed to be telling \"two narratives\" with fashion throughout her life, leaning into glamour and slightly more daring looks when she was first in the public eye.\n\nBut after Trump entered politics, Rothman said Melania's looks became more intentional because \"she was trying to say something with more storytelling\" about her identity and her husband through her fashion, as she showed at the 2016 RNC.\n\nFor the RNC, Melania wore the \"Margot\" dress from Roksanda, which she bought from Net-a-Porter, according to Vanity Fair. The modest white dress had a high neckline, a knee-length hem, and quarter-length sleeves that ended in ruffles.\n\nThe dress was simple and elegant, striking a similar tone to first ladies of years past.\n\nMelania attended her husband's inauguration in a powder-blue dress designed by Ralph Lauren Collection. The dress was paired with a matching shrug and gloves.\n\nThe silhouette was reminiscent of Jackie Kennedy's outfits during her time as first lady.\n\n\"It was so curated,\" Rothman said of the look. \"It was an instant revival of that Jackie memory.\"\n\nRothman said the nostalgia in the look lent Melania some of the power Jackie Kennedy held in the American mind, striking the right tone for the beginning of her tenure as first lady.\n\nRalph Lauren is also a classic American designer, though Melania would go on to wear European designers throughout Trump's presidency.\n\nMelania changed into a gown custom-designed by Hervé Pierre Braillard for his Hervé Pierre line.\n\nThe form-fitting, cream dress had off-the-shoulder sleeves made of the same fabric as a three-dimensional swath that cut across the bodice, creating volume. The same fabric flowed on the skirt, creating a train on one side, and a red belt cinched her waist.\n\nBraillard became Melania's stylist and strategy consultant throughout Trump's first term.\n\nIn 2018, Melania visited the Texas-Mexico border to speak to child migrants wearing a green jacket that said \"I really don't care, do u?\" on the back.\n\nThe Zara jacket instantly became controversial, leading people to speculate that the first lady was sending a message to the president or migrants at the border.\n\nIn her book \"I'll Take Your Questions Now,\" Stephanie Grisham, Melania's former aide, wrote that Trump yelled at Melania for wearing the jacket, though he later told media outlets she wore it to send a message to \"fake news\" outlets. Melania later repeated Trump's comments on the jacket, CNN reported.\n\nMelania accompanied Trump to the debate in a pinstripe Dolce & Gabbana suit.\n\nShe wore the jacket open over a white blouse with no tie and completed her look with Christian Louboutin heels.\n\nWhen the Trumps left the White House on January 20, 2021, Melania wore an all-black outfit comprising a Chanel jacket with gold button detailing, a Dolce & Gabbana dress, and Christian Louboutin heels. Black gloves and sunglasses completed the somber but chic ensemble.\n\nBut when they arrived at Mar-a-Lago later that day, Melania exited Air Force One in a $3,700 Gucci dress, though she wore the same sunglasses she had on earlier that day. Her loose gown featured quarter-length sleeves and an orange-and-navy print.\n\n\"Like anyone, sometimes we take off our work clothes, and we put on our play clothes,\" Rothman said. \"She went from wearing something super fitted to something loose that is right out of Palm Beach.\"\n\nMelania kept her public appearances more limited after Trump left office, but she appeared alongside him at a New Year's Eve party at Mar-a-Lago in December 2022.\n\nFor the occasion, she wore another Dolce & Gabbana dress. The knee-length, silver gown had long sleeves. It was covered in sparkles, as were her pointed-toe shoes.\n\nMelania paired a black long-sleeved top with a high-waisted, midi-length brown skirt from Martin Grant, which was belted with a bow at her waist. Her Chanel ballet flats featured both colors.\n\nA black Chanel bag completed her look.\n\nMelania stepped out at Mar-a-Lago in a black Versace dress for the last day of 2024.\n\nThe gown had an asymmetrical neckline that scooped low, hugged Melania's figure, then formed a slit on one leg.\n\nIt was glamorous and more reminiscent of her looks before Trump entered politics.\n\nMelania arrived at the 2025 inauguration in a custom navy coat designed by Adam Lippes.\n\nThe double-breasted jacket was elegant, and Melania paired it with navy pumps and a white scarf. However, the standout element of her look was her Eric Javits hat, which was also navy and white.\n\n\"It's a huge fashion moment,\" Rothman said of Melania's hat. She said the summery shape of the hat nodded to Melania's day-to-day life at Mar-a-Lago, while the wool texture and dark colors spoke to the role she was stepping back into.\n\n\"She wore a hat that bridges her worlds together,\" she added.\n\nMelania again turned to Hervé Pierre for her evening look at Donald Trump's inaugural balls, donning a strapless white dress. Black fabric crisscrossed the bodice and skirt, creating a slit on one side.\n\nA black choker made of the same fabric tied the look together.\n\nThe first lady wore a slew of menswear looks in early 2025, including a Ralph Lauren suit she wore to support the Take It Down Act at the US Capitol in March 2025.\n\nThe camel-toned, three-piece suit included a jacket, fitted trousers, and a vest. She paired it with a white blouse, black tie, and coordinating pumps, giving the look a distinctly formal feel.\n\nIn September 2025, Melania joined her husband on a state visit to the UK, spending time with King Charles III and Queen Camilla, as well as Prince William and Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales.\n\nFor a white-tie dinner at Windsor Castle, Melania wore a bright-yellow gown designed by Carolina Herrera. The off-the-shoulder dress had long sleeves and a floor-length skirt, and it cinched at Melania's waist with a wide purple belt.\n\nThe gown's bright color was a bold choice for the royal dinner and a marked change from the neutral looks Melania had been wearing for much of 2025.\n\nThe Trumps hosted Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, for dinner at the White House in November 2025.\n\nThe first lady wore a strapless, green gown for the dinner. Designed by Elie Saab, the $3,350 dress featured ruching on the bodice and skirt, with a slit running up the center.\n\nThe dress was pretty, but it also radiated a warm welcome for Salman, as the deep-green fabric resembled the colors of the Saudi flag. Likewise, Elie Saab held a historic fashion show in Saudi Arabia in 2024, so the choice of designer seemed to nod to Salman's country as well.\n\nWhen the 2025 Christmas tree arrived at the White House, Melania donned a knee-length white coat. The high-neck, wide-sleeved coat was typical for the first lady, but her accessories were more colorful than she might have worn in years past.\n\nShe wore red leather gloves from Max Mara, which brought drama to the look, as well as tartan pumps from Manolo Blahnik. The look was festive but still felt authentic to Melania's style.\n\nAt the start of 2026, the first lady returned to her more neutral-toned wardrobe in a Dolce & Gabbana look while promoting \"Melania.\"\n\nHer high-neck suit jacket was buttoned down the center and belted at the waist. Her midi-length skirt was column-style, and she paired the set with black pumps.\n\nThe outfit struck a professional, restrained tone, particularly compared to the colorful looks she wore in the second half of 2025.",

    "title": "Eddie Bauer through the years, from outdoor apparel icon to bankruptcy watch",
    "description": "Eddie Bauer, one of the oldest brands in American outdoor apparel,  is facing potential closures of most of its stores as bankruptcy looms.",
    "fullText": "For more than a century, Eddie Bauer has been synonymous with American outdoor adventure apparel. Now the iconic brand is facing the possible collapse of most of its brick-and-mortar business as a bankruptcy filing looms.\n\nThe retailer's roughly 180 stores across the United States and Canada could soon be shuttered amid plans for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing tied to the brand's North American store operations.\n\nEddie Bauer, one of the oldest brands in American outdoor apparel, has a storied history. It's also faced bankruptcy twice before.\n\nThe brand was founded in Seattle in 1920 by outdoorsman Eddie Bauer, who two decades later patented the first quilted goose-down jacket in the country.\n\nAt its height, Eddie Bauer had more than 500 stores worldwide, including hundreds across North America and additional locations in Japan and Germany.\n\nToday, Eddie Bauer's retail footprint has shrunk to roughly 200 stores — most of which could soon be on the chopping block as the entity operating the retailer's stores in the US and Canada prepares a bankruptcy filing, sources familiar with the situation have told Business Insider.\n\nAny potential bankruptcy filing would not affect Eddie Bauer's manufacturing, wholesale, or e-commerce operations, nor its retail business outside the US and Canada. Japan is home to several Eddie Bauer stores.\n\nHere's a look back at the Eddie Bauer brand through the years:\n\nThe late Bauer patented the iconic water-resistant, bomber-style \"Skyliner\" jacket in 1940. He was inspired to create the coat after a near-fatal experience with hypothermia during a winter fishing trip in Washington state.\n\n''I was climbing a very steep hill when I started to get sleepy,'' Bauer said in a 1981 interview with The New York Times while describing the encounter. ''I reached to touch my back and it was ice. I realized I was freezing to death.''\n\nOver the years, the Eddie Bauer brand cemented its place in the outdoor apparel industry through durable, innovative gear and clothing designed to withstand extreme conditions.\n\nEddie Bauer gear has long been used by adventurers.\n\nIn 1953, Bauer created his first mountaineering parka for the American team attempting the first ascent of K2 mountain in Pakistan.\n\nIn the decades that followed, the Eddie Bauer brand continued outfitting elite climbing teams with parkas and other cold-weather gear, including the first American team to reach the summit of Mount Everest in 1963.\n\nGeneral Mills Inc. is a big part of Eddie Bauer's history.\n\nThe cereal maker and food conglomerate owned the outdoor apparel brand from 1971 to 1988.\n\nGeneral Mills built up Eddie Bauer into a prominent retail brand, expanding it to about 60 stores before selling it to Spiegel Inc. for $260 million.\n\nEddie Bauer and Ford Motor Company partnered in the early 1980s to launch special edition Eddie Bauer vehicles. That collaboration lasted for nearly three decades.\n\nUnder the partnership, models like the Ford Explorer, Expedition, and F-150 featured Eddie Bauer trim branding and upgrades, including leather interiors and two-tone exteriors.\n\nThe Eddie Bauer Ford Explorer was particularly popular.\n\n\"Customers come in and ask to see the Eddie Bauer version, and it's almost sold on sight,\" a general manager of an Ohio car dealership told The Plain Dealer newspaper in 1991.\n\nIn 2000, Eddie Bauer partnered with the environmental organization Riverkeeper on the Eddie Bauer-Riverkeeper Kayak Challenge held on the Hudson River near Manhattan's Chelsea Piers.\n\nActor brothers Alec Baldwin and Billy Baldwin were among the participants at the event. Photos from the challenge show that the Baldwin brothers got soaked.\n\nEddie Bauer has previously been through two Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructurings.\n\nThe first time was in 2003 when its then-parent company, Spiegel, filed for bankruptcy. Eddie Bauer emerged from that bankruptcy two years later as a stand-alone company.\n\nFacing mounting debt, the retailer filed for Chapter 11 in 2009 and was acquired by private equity firm Golden Gate Capital later that year through a bankruptcy auction.\n\nThe brand was later acquired by Authentic Brands Group, in partnership with SPARC Group (which has since become Catalyst Brands), in 2021.",

    "description": "The Sixers turned in another third-quarter meltdown to waste a good Joel Embiid performance, falling 119-115 to the Los Angeles Lakers in infuriating fashion. Here’s what I saw. Third quarter...",
    "fullText": "The Sixers turned in another third-quarter meltdown to waste a good Joel Embiid performance, falling 119-115 to the Los Angeles Lakers in infuriating fashion.\n\nJoel Embiid had just an okay game against the Clippers in Philadelphia’s barnstorming win on Monday, sitting out the second half of a back-to-back against Golden State the next night. It felt a little bit like he owed these guys something, if for no other reason than having the freshest pair of legs. And boy, did he deliver on that, sparking the Sixers early while playing a do-it-all hub on offense for a team that struggled to make shots for most of the night.\n\nWith the Lakers down Jaxson Hayes thanks to his mascot-related suspension — yes, he really is that big of a clown — DeAndre Ayton was the only guy close to like-sized that L.A. could throw at him. But it didn’t especially matter, outside of a few offensive rebounds Ayton pulled down at his expense. Ayton’s on-again, off-again effort is a bad matchup for an opponent who will take any bit of space and rise into a midrange jumper, and Embiid was able to get the shot going within the first five minutes of the game. When that happens, opponents are in jail trying to guard him, as it opens up opportunities to punish reach-ins and drive by jumpy defenders.\n\nOutside of Ayton, the Lakers mixed up coverages and the defender primarily tasked with guarding Embiid. From Jarred Vanderbilt to Maxi Kleber and others across the spectrum, the main theme was a big size advantage for Embiid. On some nights, that might mean deep post catches and a free-throw parade, but with Embiid often operating from the middle of a zone, it meant a lot of jumpers his man could never get close enough to contest. One little jab step, one little body language cue, and the Lakers were falling all over themselves to stay with him, with Embiid rising into lightly-contested shots for the entire first half. 20 easy points at halftime, thank you very much.\n\nEmbiid had some sloppiness with the handle early, but he was killing the Lakers as a playmaker for others, too, punctuating his first half with an outstanding play: Embiid faked a handoff attempt to Tyrese Maxey, drove downhill into the space the Lakers left vacated, and as the defense collapsed on him in the paint, he released the ball to Dominick Barlow for an easy bucket, sending the Sixers into halftime on a high note.\n\nEverything was rolling along until, you guessed it, the third quarter hit. I cannot believe we are this far into the season and still treating the quarter after halftime as an unsolvable Sphinx riddle for the Sixers to solve. Change the opponent, the venue, the players on the floor, nothing really matters. They will find a way to stink it up all the same.\n\nThere was a decided lack of seriousness from the Sixers after they surged to a double-digit lead early in the third, allowing the Lakers to get back into the game with seven turnovers in a single quarter. They were mostly in cruise control until about the halfway point of the third, and then the wheels came off. Nurse resisted turning to his bench as the Sixers held onto a small but mildly comfortable lead, and it all came crashing down in the end-of-quarter stretch, with Maxey battling foul trouble and Embiid resting on the bench.\n\nEnter Quentin Grimes, a mystifying player to watch. His first half was filled with genuinely awesome moments, with Grimes best understanding what needs to be done when Austin Reaves is on the floor. Drawing him in isolation repeatedly, Grimes went right by him to the rim on several different occasions, making Reaves work as he tore up the Sixers on the other end. He also put down his second highlight dunk of the week with a hellacious throwdown over Jake LaRavia, who I presume had a family.\n\nTELL THEM DON’T JUMP, Q!!! 💥🤯pic.twitter.com/K78SL0bJGp\n\n— PHLY Sixers (@PHLY_Sixers) February 6, 2026\n\nThe second half was what we will charitably refer to as an adventure. When Grimes checked into the game for his end-of-third minutes, the game almost immediately flipped in the wrong direction. He had a brutal turnover, a bad foul, and a miscommunication with VJ Edgecombe in quick succession, and the Lakers were surging. His first good play of that stretch, a steal near halfcourt, was nearly botched before order was restored, only for Kelly Oubre to launch a tightly-contested three with close to 20 seconds left on the shot clock. Not the time or the place, particularly when you’re 2/7 at the time, Mr. Oubre.\n\nThis was the first stretch of basketball over the last week where I felt they desperately needed Paul George. In those backup lineups where they try to buy rest for Embiid and Maxey, it tends to be George who emerges as a cooler head, attacking in isolation or offering spacing for VJ Edgecombe to attack in. With George in street clothes, we were back to early-season Sixers hoops, with the Edgecombe/Grimes/Watford/Oubre combo dying for some spacing, plus decision-making, and savvy.\n\nDown two points with 27 seconds left, the Sixers apparently decided they would trap late and concede a basket instead of either defending the play straight up or fouling to play the back-and-forth game. On the ensuing possession with 12 seconds left, Maxey took a ridiculous foul-baiting three and lost them the opportunity for even a chance to tie or win the game.\n\nOne of the dumbest sequences in Sixers history, straight up.\n\nVJ Edgecombe is what I would affectionately refer to as an all-action player, someone who rarely rests on his laurels who helps you win games no matter what the moment requires. Those guys can occasionally cross the line and go careening into the opponent, trying too hard to impact the game while it boomerangs back on them. But he is a rare breed of rookie, constantly playing with 100 percent effort while minimizing his wild moments on both ends of the floor.\n\nIn fact, Edgecombe often cleans up craziness from other players. Joel Embiid had the rare opportunity to throw him a lob on the break, tossing the ensuing pass so high that two VJ Edgecombes stacked on top of one another in a trenchcoat probably wouldn’t have reached the ball. But after making the attempt to meet it at the summit, Edgecombe collected himself quickly and saved it from going out of bounds, ultimately earning the Sixers an extra possession that ended with an Embiid midrange make. These plays are a constant in the Edgecombe experience.\n\nThe Lakers tried to dare the Sixers into beating them with the three-ball with a fair amount of zone, and Edgecombe was the only guy making outside shots to potentially get them out of it. He is slowly starting to figure out the happy medium on the break, darting through traffic for layups and dunks or slowing down to find an open shooter if those easy opportunities aren’t there. Edgecombe was one of their few solid options defending Austin Reaves, who gave L.A. a big lift off the bench, ripping him on a first-half possession before the Sixers got out and scored on the break.\n\nAt least, that was the case for the first half, because Edgecombe ran into a wall and struggled mightily in winning time for Philadelphia. He was a little too much gas without brakes, throwing up some wild attempts inside the arc with no whistles to save him. And even after he made a gigantic steal and hit a three and drew them within three, he and Grimes combined for one of the worst fouls of the season, fouling down three with 35 seconds left when a normal defensive possession would have sufficed.\n\nBut I was much more disappointed in Tyrese Maxey, who had an impactful passing game but a dire attacking performance, letting the Lakers dissuade him from getting past the initial defensive coverage while jacking missed three after missed three on stepback jumpers. Between true zone coverage and some extra bodies in the paint sagging off of questionable shooters, Maxey relied far too much on his jumper on a night where he had nothing going from deep.\n\nCould the Sixers have been more purposeful with their offense to get him rolling? I think so, yes. First play of the game, they ran him off of an Iverson cut to get him a look closer to the basket, and rarely turned to off-ball action to get him looks the rest of the night.\n\nIf not for the lack of incoming players at the trade deadline, we’d have a real opportunity to celebrate Dominick Barlow, who is one of the great organizational success stories of the last two years. Signed to a standard deal on Thursday evening, Barlow rose quickly from an end-of-bench afterthought to an essential piece of this Sixers team.\n\nIt has been a big road trip for Barlow, who brought his standard brand of energy and athleticism to the arena against L.A. One of the high notes of a solid Sixers first half was an end-to-end sequence from Barlow, who came from the weakside to block Rui Hachimura on a deep catch before streaking to the other end, finishing with style for two points after outrunning the entire Lakers team in transition.\n\nHis night was defined by work in and around the dunker spot, with Barlow catching drop-off after drop-off from every available passer.\n\n— In games where an opponent gets a whistle that seems ultra skewed against one team, my dad likes to shout to no one in particular, “It’s like playing the Globetrotters!” It certainly felt like the Harlem Lakers were on the floor on Thursday night.\n\n(All that said, the officials did not win this game for the Lakers. The Sixers happily gave this game away themselves. But Jenna Schroeder is the worst ref in the league and I don’t even think it’s close.)\n\n— That was perhaps the worst Oubre game of his Sixers tenure and a version of him I thought he largely left behind in Charlotte. Embarrassing shot selection, miserable off-ball defense, every negative trait in his profile on full display all at once.",

The drop includes a co-branded T-shirt priced at $40 and a hoodie retailing for $75, along with a custom hockey-card-style pizza box created specifically for the partnership.

    "fullText": "The JBL PartyBox 520 is the kind of speaker you buy when phone speakers and compact Bluetooth boxes stop cutting it. It’s currently $599.95 at Woot, a steep drop from its usual $879.95 price. Price trackers show the lowest it’s ever hit before was $699.95, so this is the best deal yet. Prime members get free standard shipping,and the deal runs for another three weeks or until it sells out. This is a tall, tower-style speaker that sits above the PartyBox Stage 320 in JBL’s PartyBox lineup.\n\nAt just under 57 pounds, you’re not casually slinging it over your shoulder, but its wheels and telescopic handle make it manageable. The big advantage here is flexibility. You can run it on battery power or plug it into the wall, which makes it easier to place where the party actually is. And once you’ve rolled it into place—patio, garage, backyard—the 520 does what it’s meant to: bring the boom. Two stacked woofers and dual tweeters push out stereo sound with enough power to fill large outdoor spaces. The bass hits hard, but the mids and highs stay clean, even when you crank it. The companion app lets you tweak EQ settings or turn on Bass Boost, while the top panel gives you manual control over sound, lighting, and custom effects. It has just about every input you’d want: Bluetooth 5.4, USB-C audio, AUX, and dual mic/instrument ports with gain knobs. Battery life is rated at 15 hours, and real-world use lands closer to 12, which is still enough for a long event.\n\nStill, it’s not for everyone. It only plays properly when upright, and the front-facing design means you’ll get the best sound standing in front of it, not off to the side. It’s also heavy, and the plastic wheels aren’t made for trails or bumpy lawns. There's no voice assistant, no speakerphone functionality, and no real smart features. But if your only goal is to plug in, press play, and turn your space into a full-blown rave or karaoke night, this deal makes it a strong case.",

    "fullText": "Selling Chicago-style pizza outside of Chicago has always been a challenge.\n\nAs someone who grew up near Boston, a city with a grand tradition of thinner-crust pizza offered by chains such as Pizzeria Regina, Papa Gino's, and Santarpio's, deep-dish pizza seemed like an entirely different food. It wasn't something commonly sold during my childhood, and it remains something I've never really considered pizza.\n\nDespite that, Uno Pizzeria, which was known as Pizzeria Uno back in the 1980s and 90s, flourished in New England. The chain offered a version of deep-dish pizza that was a take on the Chicago classic, but also closer to traditional pizza.\n\nIt was deep-dish, but not quite as deep as what's traditionally sold under that name. You could eat it with a fork and knife, but you could also pick it up and eat it as a slice.\n\nUno did not exactly take over New England, but it became a steady presence with dozens of locations across the region. That presence has slowly withered, as the overall chain has shrunk from over 150 locations nationwide to only 36 as of Feb. 3, 2026, according to the locations page on the company's website.\n\nNow, the chain has suddenly closed three more Massachusetts locations.\n\nUno Pizzeria has closed locations in Dedham, Revere, and Braintree, Massachusetts, without any notification to customers, Boston's WCVB reported.\n\nThe chain posted a notice on its Facebook page, which has since been taken down.\n\n“After 34 years of serving this amazing community, our Revere location is closing its doors for the last time on Sunday,” the restaurant posted. “We would like to extend a massive thank you to everyone who has made this restaurant feel like home for over three decades. It’s been an unforgettable run!”\n\nTaco Bell and KFC work on simplifying their restaurants\n\nChick-fil-A making major change to 425 restaurants nationwide\n\nBankrupt beer and pizza restaurant chain closes locations\n\nRestaurant chain famed for rude waiters closes multiple locations\n\nThese shutdowns leave only five Massachusetts locations listed on the chain’s website. Two locations are listed for New Hampshire, in Concord and Tilton. No Uno restaurants remain in Rhode Island.\n\nUno did not return a request for comment from the news station.\n\nDedham, Massachusetts: Uno Pizzeria & Grill location closed permanently on Jan. 11, after 37 years in business.\n\nRevere, Massachusetts: Longtime local restaurant shut its doors on Jan. 11, ending 34 years of service.\n\nBraintree, Massachusetts: Uno closed this 33-year-old location on Jan. 11.\n\nWarwick, Rhode Island: The last Uno Pizzeria & Grill in Rhode Island closed alongside the Massachusetts locations.\n\nSignificant reduction in total units: Uno has been shrinking over the past few years; it closed more than a quarter of its U.S. system in 2024, dropping from around 68 locations to about 53, and continued closures have pushed that count lower in 2025, reported Nation's Restaurant News (NRN).",

Not just ones that adopt the aesthetic of Y2K gaming – think Crow Country or Fear the Spotlight’s deliberately retro PS1-style fuzzy polygons – but semi-autobiographical games specifically about the millennial experience. I’ve played three in the past year. Despelote is set in 2002 in Ecuador and is played through the eyes of a football-obsessed eight-year-old. The award-winning Consume Me is about being a teen girl battling disordered eating in the 00s. And this week I played a point-and-click adventure game about being a college student in the early 2000s.\n\nPerfect Tides: Station to Station is set in New York in 2003 – a year that is the epitome of nostalgia for the micro-generation that grew up without the internet but came of age online. It was before Facebook, before the smartphone, but firmly during the era of late-night forum browsing and instant-messenger conversations. The internet wasn’t yet a vector for mass communication, but it could still bring you together with other people who loved the things that you loved, people who read the same hipster blogs and liked the same bands. The protagonist, Mara, is a student and young writer who works in her college library.\n\nThe earnestness with which Perfect Tides presents the college experience – quoting full paragraphs from pretentious texts, awkward interactions with classmates, stilted phone calls with Mara’s boyfriend back home – predates the concept of cringe. A key difference between the millennial generation and that of gen Z is that millennials did not grow up curating an online image on social media, and therefore had a much lesser terror of being perceived. We’d put up entire albums of terrible, blurry photos from a single night out, write nonstop on LiveJournal, produce appalling juvenilia and then post it on fanfic or art forums.\n\nNaturally, we find this embarrassing now, as do the younger generation, who enjoy making fun of millennial cringe. But Perfect Tides takes place in a time where nobody was worried about being embarrassing online or, indeed, in person. It’s a time before “hipster” emerged as an insult. Mara inhales everything around her – an anarchist philosophy book, music and movies, everything she hears professors say in class, new relationships – and reading, talking to other characters, and writing essays deepens her understanding of these topics, opening up new avenues of conversation in turn. It’s a cute way of gamifying the process of expanding your intellectual and taste horizons. She’s at an age where every experience and idea is new.\n\nPerfect Tides shares an aesthetic with Consume Me. Each embrace the sometimes messy pixel-art of 90s computer adventure games – but Consume Me’s tone is comedic and satirical where Perfect Tides’ is earnest. Both, however, are part of a long tradition of coming-of-age stories that emerge from every generation that has had the luxury of education and a free-form young adulthood. “Emerging adulthood”, a phrase coined by psychologist Jeffrey Arnett in 2000, is a useful descriptor for this stage of life: the extended period of identity formation, distinct from adolescence, that usually happens between 18 and 29 in societies where it is economically possible and culturally permissible for young adults to pursue further education.\n\nFor a lot of people, this is an especially redolent and memorable period of life, which is why there are so very many novels, films and TV shows about young adulthood. Playing Perfect Tides reminded me of Douglas Coupland’s youth-memoir novel, Generation X, which was part of the cultural canon when I was a teenager. And it makes sense that the first generation to truly grow up with games – my generation – is now making sense of those experiences through creating games. The bildungsroman of the 1800s has become the autobiographical indie game of the 2020s.\n\nIt is the very specificity of Perfect Tides – the year, the setting, Mara herself – that makes it feel so human and personal. You don’t have to be part of a specific generation to appreciate that generation’s art: when I read autofiction set in the 1960s or the 80s, I learn something about what it felt like to be alive in that time. When I play these millennial autofiction games, I relate to them more closely – there are aspects of Mara’s young-adulthood experience that closely mirror my own – but I’m still learning something. By spending a little time in these fictionalised memories, I’m learning how someone else experienced those same formative years.\n\nLook, I just can’t face another capitalist-dystopia piece of media at the moment. So I’m going to have to save Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator for a little later in the year, when I’m feeling more resilient. In this strategy-game-meets-stock-market simulator, you bet your credits on the life outcomes of fictional alien babies, watching their lives play out in text alerts. This anticapitalist satirical offering is from the people at Strange Scaffold, a studio that has now made a profitable habit of turning tweet-length jokes into full games (see also Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion and An Airport for Aliens Run By Dogs).\n\nAvailable on: PC\n\n Estimated playtime: 1-3 hours\n\nSony has patented the idea of personalised AI podcasts hosted by characters from its games. I am equal parts horrified and darkly amused by the thought of PaRappa the Rapper reading out patch notes.\n\nUK game retailer GAME has died yet another death, reports the Game Business, having struggled since the early 2010s. Its last three shops will close, and most of its other operations have already wound down. It will continue to exist within Sports Direct and House of Fraser stores.\n\nI’m still not done thinking about Hollow Knight Silksong, so I enjoyed this article by Nicole Clark, on the new feminist games website Mothership, about the game’s unexpected compassion.\n\nBloomberg visited Obsidian – one of Microsoft’s most interesting developers – for this studio profile, in which its leaders talk about how they ended up releasing three games in 2025.\n\nAnd finally: my book about Nintendo is finally out this week in the US, and next week in the UK. I’m doing a bunch of launch events in Glasgow, Edinburgh, St Andrews, London and Brighton. I’d love to see you there – tickets are here.\n\nThere’s a reason that Wii Bowling remains my mum’s favourite game of all time | Dominik Diamond\n\nCairn – obsession, suffering and awe in a climbing game that hits exhausting new heights | ★★★★☆\n\nIron Lung – YouTuber Markiplier crash lands with big-screen sci-fi horror | ★★☆☆☆\n\nThis week’s question comes from reader Gavin:\n\n“Could you explain the current debate around physical game ownership v digital? And the grey area of buying a digital code in a physical box? I can’t imagine those codes will be collector’s items in 10 years’ time ...”\n\nOnce upon a time, all video games came on cassette tapes, discs or cartridges, usually in tragically damage-prone cardboard boxes, with paper manuals. Then, when digital downloads became practical, we had a choice: either you buy your game on a disc in a box, or you go for the convenience of a downloaded version that exists on your hard drive. Now, however, it is difficult or even impossible to buy many games in a physical format. And even when you do, the disc simply prompts a 50GB download, or the box contains nothing but a redeemable code.\n\nDigital downloads are preferable for the businesses that run the gaming industry, for two reasons. Firstly: there are no manufacturing, packaging and shipping costs. Secondly: Sony, Apple, Steam, Microsoft or Nintendo gets around a 30% cut of every game sold digitally on their platforms, which is essentially free money for them. At one point, game retailers had too much power for these platform holders to abandon physical games: too many copies of FIFA and COD were sold at branches of GAME. But now, with bricks-and-mortar game retail a vanishing business, digital downloads are the norm.\n\nDigital downloads are convenient for players, of course, but they also come with huge disadvantages. What you’re buying is a licence, which at some theoretical future point could expire or become unusable, rendering your games unplayable. You can’t sell on a digital code or transfer ownership. For this reason a lot of people still prefer physical media, of all kinds. And everybody hates code-in-a-box. It’s the worst of both worlds.\n\nIf you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – email us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.",

    "description": "Disney's next CEO often sports a similar look to that of longtime leader Bob Iger. Experts weigh in on the pros and cons of dressing like your boss.",
    "fullText": "Disney's new CEO is sending a wink with his wardrobe, whether he means to or not.\n\nJosh D'Amaro, who takes the helm of the Mouse House next month, has drawn attention for dressing much like his soon-to-be predecessor, Bob Iger. Both men regularly don sweaters over collared shirts and have a penchant for jackets paired with white dress shirts. At a celebration for Disney's 70th Anniversary last year, the pair sported button-downs and dark slacks.\n\nWhile D'Amaro may just have a natural affinity for the same kind of attire that Iger sports, leadership experts say the similar look projects continuity to Disney's stakeholders. The familiarity may resonate at Disney, where Iger has led the company on and off for nearly two decades — though it raises a question of whether the rest of us should dress like the leaders we hope to one day succeed.\n\n\"You want to avoid looking like a carbon copy of the person,\" said Bradley Akubuiro, a partner at leadership advisory firm Bully Pulpit International in Chicago. \"But there are elements that you want to keep if you can.\"\n\nThose elements should be modest, akin to how Apple CEO Tim Cook doesn't deviate too far from the black turtleneck and jeans his predecessor Steve Jobs regularly wore, suggested Jennifer Eggers, president of executive advisory firm LeaderShift Insights in Pennsylvania.\n\nA few years ago, she said a client of hers from a Fortune 200 retailer went overboard by wearing the same distinctive jewelry as his boss. When she met with his peers for feedback on his performance, several described him as a copycat.\n\n\"It really hurt him,\" said Eggers. \"We coached him, and he eventually lost his jewelry.\"\n\nStill, there can be benefits to mimicking a higher-up's sense of fashion when done subtly, added Akubuiro. \"People have a tendency to like people who are more like them,\" he said.\n\nJust keep in mind the fuzzy warm feeling may be temporary.\n\n\"It's effective as a bridge maybe, but not as a destination,\" said Eggers. \"Eventually, leadership credibility has to stand on its own.\"\n\nD'Amaro, who started at Disney in 1998 as a Disneyland business planner, faces a challenging road ahead no matter what he wears. He's tasked with growing streaming platforms like Disney+ and Hulu to offset declines in its TV networks business, while easing ESPN's transition into the streaming age.\n\nA post shared by Robert Iger (@robertiger)\n\nWhile D'Amaro's fashion style is similar to Iger's, Akubuiro said the business-casual look has also made sense for his role as a park executive.\n\n\"This is kind of the uniform of someone walking around the parks, and so it gives him a very accessible feel,\" Akubuiro said. \"When you're making a change, that accessibility is something that actually brings people in and gives them some confidence.\"",

    "description": "Disney parks veteran Josh D'Amaro will soon take the torch from CEO Bob Iger. Get to know D'Amaro, who's been at Disney since 1998.",
    "fullText": "It's official: Josh D'Amaro is Disney's new top dog — or, in this case, mouse.\n\nD'Amaro, who oversees Disney's parks as its experiences chairman, was just chosen to succeed Bob Iger as CEO. Iger is set to step down on March 18, paving the way for D'Amaro to take over.\n\nD'Amaro is an \"exceptional leader and the right person to become our next CEO,\" Iger said in a statement. Disney's board voted unanimously for his promotion on Monday, the company said in a statement.\n\nThe incoming CEO has big shoes to fill, and much to learn about Disney's business beyond its parks, cruises, and products. D'Amaro will be tasked with growing streaming platforms like Disney+ and Hulu to offset declines in its TV networks business, while easing ESPN's transition into the streaming age.\n\nHere's what Disney fans, employees, and investors need to know about D'Amaro as he becomes CEO.\n\nD'Amaro, a Massachusetts native, shares a birthday with Iger, who is exactly 20 years older. He'll be 55 years old on February 10, as his eventual predecessor turns 75. The two also appear to have a similar fashion sense. Both D'Amaro and Iger regularly don sweaters over collared shirts, and have a penchant for jackets paired with white shirts.\n\nFrom childhood, D'Amaro was a Disney fan. He told the Orlando Business Journal in 2020 that his must-do Disney World ride is \"Peter Pan's Flight,\" which he said he and his siblings rode as kids — an experience he said he tries to recreate \"whenever I'm here.\"\n\nThe soon-to-be CEO studied business administration at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. He had transferred in from New York's Skidmore College, where he studied art and sculpting but had doubts about how he'd make a living, The New York Times reported.\n\nAfter graduating in 1993, D'Amaro worked at Boston-based Gillette for a few years.\n\nD'Amaro began his Disney journey in 1998, working at Disneyland as a business planner. Twenty years later, he became president of Disneyland, before moving from Anaheim to Orlando a year later to take the same position at Disney World.\n\nBefore that role, D'Amaro had worked on the park's business development, marketing strategy, and sales teams. D'Amaro also had roles at Disney World's Animal Kingdom and Hong Kong Disneyland — a valuable experience, given how crucial China is to Disney's business.\n\nOutside the parks, D'Amaro had also worked in Disney's consumer products businesses as a VP of global licensing.\n\nAfter more than two decades at Disney, D'Amaro was promoted to Disney Experiences chairman to oversee parks, cruises, and consumer products in early 2020 — at the most difficult time possible amid a pandemic.\n\nD'Amaro filled a role left by then-CEO Bob Chapek, who was eventually pushed out and replaced by Iger, who had retired.\n\nUnder his tenure, Disney has continued to expand its parks business, including announcing its plans to launch a seventh park, located in Abu Dhabi.\n\n\"For every one theme park visitor that we have in our existing experiences today, we believe there are 10 more out there that want to come and participate in the Disney experience,\" D'Amaro said in May at MoffettNathanson's media conference.\n\nUnder D'Amaro, an experiences business that slowed to a standstill during the pandemic roared back to life as Disney fans raced back to the parks after years of being cooped up at home.\n\nAs demand for Disney parks surged, so did prices. Park ticket costs have risen in each of the past four years, and profits, revenue, and visits have climbed as well.\n\nWhile Disney has received some criticism from fans for making its parks less affordable for middle-class families — with a slew of upcharges for fast-pass Lightning Lanes and costly food — those complaints don't appear to be hurting the company's bottom line.\n\nDisney's experiences segment just topped $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time ever, while its $3.3 billion in operating income made up more than 70% of the company's profit.\n\nAs CEO, D'Amaro must gain Wall Street's favor by pulling off similar feats in Disney's streaming, TV, and movie businesses. Disney's stock has fallen around 9% over the past year, and it's shed about 43% of its value from five years ago.\n\nAlthough another Iger unretirement and takeover is almost inconceivable, the longtime Disney leader has made clear that he's left the company on the right track, putting pressure on his successor.\n\nBoth the experiences and entertainment businesses \"have the ability to grow nicely into the future, given all the investments that we've made and the trajectory that we're on,\" Iger said on Disney's earnings call on Monday.\n\nIger also made it clear that his successor must be bold and make their own mark on Disney.\n\n\"When I came back three years ago, I had a tremendous amount that needed fixing,\" Iger said. \"But anyone who runs a company also knows that it can't just be about fixing. It has to be about preparing a company for its future and really putting in place, taking steps to create opportunities for growth.\"",

    "description": "A couple in Vancouver transitioned from corporate careers in fashion and tech to cofound No Reception Club and create travel products for parents.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Gemma Ng, 39, and Daniel Ng, 38, the husband-and-wife cofounders of No Reception Club, who are based in Vancouver. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nGemma: We've been together since we were 19, when we were both studying international business at different universities. We met during an internship program.\n\nI spent a decade in fashion at companies like Ralph Lauren, Theory, and Banana Republic, working as a merchant and a buyer.\n\nDaniel started in finance as an investment banker and private equity investor, then pivoted into tech after his MBA. He worked at Yelp, One Kings Lane, and Cherish.\n\nNow, we run a company together called No Reception Club.\n\nGemma: We felt challenged, and we were working in industries we admired. I once thought it'd be so cool to be VP of merchandising at a retailer I love. Daniel had ambitions in tech leadership.\n\nWe weren't miserable, but 10 years in, we started asking: Where is this path going? What does it look like in another five or 10 years?\n\nThe reality is, the higher you go in corporate America, the less you do of the thing that drew you there. We both loved building products — mine were physical, his were digital.\n\nWhen you look up the ladder, success looks more like managing 40 or 50 people, sitting in meetings all day, navigating politics, and less about creating. That didn't appeal to us.\n\nDaniel: Over the years, we'd tinker with side hustle ideas, but nothing ever stuck.\n\nThat changed after our son was born in 2019. When he was seven months old, we took a five-hour flight from San Francisco to Hawaii, and it was a disaster. Everything that could go wrong did. We were miserable, and honestly, angry at each other.\n\nSitting on that plane, we thought, Why isn't anyone making this easier? There are travel brands and parenting brands, but there was nothing at the intersection.\n\nGemma: On that same trip in Hawaii, we had a long dinner conversation and decided we were going to give it a go. Practically, that meant I'd quit first. My background in creating physical products was more directly relevant in the early days, and we wanted to be product-first.\n\nI gave notice at my job a month later and started working on our business full time in March 2020. Daniel stayed at Yelp, working nights and weekends on our business. We were both earning six-figure salaries in our last corporate roles.\n\nDaniel: For two years, we balanced it that way. Gemma led product development while I kept my day job.\n\nDaniel: The campaign ran for 33 days over July and August of 2021. We reached our initial funding target of $30,000 in less than three days, and the campaign went on to raise nearly $67,000.\n\nWe did it by posting extensively in family travel Facebook groups about our products to get feedback and share about the campaign. We also reached out cold to publications and influencers who might be interested in our products.\n\nDaniel: In 2021, we launched our first product, the Getaway Bag, the first travel-specific diaper bag.\n\nI still remember the thrill of sitting there with our kid when we went live, and wondering, Is anyone going to show up? Or will this be like Halloween, with the lights on and nobody knocking?\n\nThen we got our first sale, then 10, then 100. It was exhilarating.\n\nIt was also exhausting. Our first inventory shipment arrived while Gemma was nine months pregnant with our second child.\n\nWith COVID-19 supply chain delays, the timing couldn't have been worse. We were working nonstop, packing orders ourselves, running to the post office, and barely sleeping.\n\nI hit a breaking point. I went for a run to clear my head and came back knowing I needed to quit Yelp. It wasn't because our startup income had replaced my salary — it hadn't.\n\nDaniel: I didn't want to regret not betting on us. I told myself I'd give it a year. If it didn't work, I could always go back to tech. That leap of faith paid off. The business now fully supports our family.\n\nBuilding a company together while raising kids brings its own challenges. At first, we thought the secret would be clear boundaries: Gemma owns physical, I own digital. In practice, we're in each other's worlds constantly.\n\nWe consult on everything, which actually comes from a place of trust and respect. There's always a clear owner who takes it to the finish line, but we value each other's perspectives. It's not unusual to see both of us in the same meeting, rolling our chairs over to join.\n\nGemma: It's very easy for every moment to become a work moment. Early on, Daniel had a habit of asking me business questions right before bed, which kept me from sleeping because my brain was spinning.\n\nWe've learned to be intentional. We carve out at least an hour at night for no work — just watching a show or reading.\n\nGemma: We give each other veto power to say, \"not now,\" and we've gotten better at reading the moment.\n\nHaving an office in our home has also helped. For a long time, our desks were in the dining room, the living room, and even the bedroom. Now at least we can shut the door, even if our kids still press their faces against the glass.\n\nThe home office is the only office our business uses, and we're the only full-time employees. We have contracted part-time support for customer service.\n\nDaniel: In a corporate setting, your coworkers only know your office self. As partners, we know everything that's going on — it's the first week of school, a parent is sick, the kids are extra needy. We can adjust priorities with a full understanding of the bigger picture.\n\nGemma: Working with your spouse can be complicated, but for us, the benefits outweigh the challenges. There's no one I'd rather be building this with.",

Japan is home to several Eddie Bauer stores.\n\nThere are multiple parties interested in a portion of the existing North American store fleet, the sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nIn a Chapter 11 scenario, those interested parties could bid on all or part of the store operating business, according to the sources.\n\nAny winning bidder would then acquire the operating business out of bankruptcy and license the rights from Authentic Brands Group — which owns the Eddie Bauer brand and IP worldwide — to operate any remaining Eddie Bauer stores.\n\nRepresentatives for Authentic Brands Group declined to comment, while Catalyst Brands — the operator also behind JCPenney, Nautica, Brooks Brothers, and others — did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nLast month, Authentic Brands Group announced that it was transitioning the licenses for Eddie Bauer's manufacturing, e-commerce, and wholesale operations in North America from Catalyst to Outdoor 5.\n\nEddie Bauer has filed for bankruptcy twice before, once in 2003 and again in 2009. In 2021, the brand was acquired by Authentic Brands Group in partnership with SPARC Group, which later became Catalyst Brands.",

    "description": "Kevin Warsh, Trump's pick for Fed chair, is a good listener who seeks consensus, former colleagues say. That could shape how he would run the Fed.",
    "fullText": "Don't expect Kevin Warsh to be a bomb-thrower.\n\nSeveral longtime observers of the Federal Reserve told Business Insider that President Donald Trump's pick to become its next chairman is a good listener who looks for consensus.\n\nThat could prove essential for Warsh, who has emerged as a sometimes-vocal critic since leaving the central bank more than a decade ago. While some Fed watchers criticized Warsh's nomination, citing shifts in his stance on interest rates, others praised his experience and communication skills.\n\nIf confirmed as its next chair, Warsh would need to steer an institution increasingly caught between public pressure and the maintenance of a somewhat frayed internal consensus.\n\nTrump has repeatedly criticized Jerome Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May, for not cutting rates faster. That backdrop would likely test any incoming chair's ability to defend the central bank's independence.\n\nFormer colleagues say that Warsh understands the importance of the Fed's dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. That grounding, they say, could help him manage internal debates even as external expectations shift.\n\n\"Warsh has a very valuable skillset of insider experience and outsider critique,\" said Aaron Klein, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, who worked with Warsh after 9/11, when Warsh served under President George W. Bush.\n\nWarsh proved easy to work with and adept at listening, Klein said — skills that matter when a leader must manage disagreement rather than impose direction.\n\nThe chair is only one of 12 votes on monetary policy, though that person also controls the Fed's \"incredibly powerful staff,\" he said.\n\nDonald Kohn, who spent 40 years at the central bank and worked alongside Warsh as a Fed governor, said in a statement to Business Insider that Warsh understands that the Fed's decision-making must remain focused on its dual mandate.\n\nHe has a good ability to read the room, said Kohn, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Kohn said he worked closely with Warsh during the \"stressful years\" of the 2007-09 global financial crisis.\n\nThe ability to gauge a group's temperature could be critical. Warsh would be returning to a policymaking environment — and to staff and officials — he has publicly criticized in recent years.\n\nCongress set up the Fed so that it would be shielded from political pressure to juice the economy by slashing rates — and risk subsequent inflation.\n\n\"He knows he will need to use his considerable skills to marshal evidence and analysis to support the direction he wants to take policy,\" Kohn said.\n\nThat matters in part because the bank's Federal Open Market Committee, which sets short-term rates, is divided; it hasn't voted unanimously since July. The committee was again split at its January meeting, when 10 members, including Powell, voted to hold on rates, while two sought a cut.\n\nIn recent years, Warsh has sharpened his critiques of the Fed, including in speeches and in his academic work at Stanford. In a 2023 op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, he called for \"regime change\" in US economic policy. Warsh criticized the Fed for being too slow to corral inflation after policymakers slashed borrowing costs in the early days of the pandemic.\n\nKlein, who was a lead Democratic staffer on Warsh's original Senate confirmation in 2006, said that Warsh's critiques from academia have been \"reasonable and thoughtful.\"\n\nKlein added that Warsh's experience makes him an ideal operator to make changes at the central bank if he's once again confirmed by the Senate.\n\n\"I hope he shakes up the Fed's decision-making process, which has gotten most of the major bank regulatory questions dead wrong over the last 30 years, while maintaining the Fed's independence on monetary policy,\" Klein said.\n\nA Fed spokesperson declined to comment on the critique.\n\nNot everyone sees Warsh as a change agent, despite his criticisms. There is a risk that his instinct to seek common ground could become a limitation, Joseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist at RSM US, told Business Insider.\n\n\"He's consensus-oriented and not willing to jump too far out in front of the committee,\" Brusuelas said.\n\nIn reading policymaking transcripts from Warsh's time at the Fed, from 2006 to 2011, he came off as a follower rather than a leader, Brusuelas said.\n\n\"He's an echo, not the tip of the spear,\" he said.\n\nA leadership style that's focused on common consent and \"organized around protecting the status quo\" means that Warsh will likely \"always be late\" to needed policy shifts due to domestic or external shocks, Brusuelas said.\n\nWarsh didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nAsked about the criticism, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that to restore confidence at the Fed, the president's primary considerations for a new chairman were \"competence and experience.\"\n\n\"Kevin Warsh is eminently qualified to hold the job,\" Desai said.\n\nFamed economist Mohamed El-Erian likewise sees Warsh as a good fit, writing on X that Warsh \"brings a strong mix of deep expertise, broad experience, and sharp communication skills.\"",

    "fullText": "Celebrations didn't stop after the 2026 Grammys concluded on Sunday night.\n\nFollowing the awards ceremony inside the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, stars like Justin Bieber, Teyana Taylor, Tate McRae, and more headed to glamorous after-parties.\n\nWhile some of them remained in their stunning red-carpet looks, others changed into statement outfits on the way there.\n\nHere's what they wore, from a leather dress and a see-through trench coat to a casual hoodie.\n\nBieber was spotted outside the W Magazine party with his friend and fellow artist Billie Eilish.\n\nHe ditched the oversize Balenciaga suit he wore at the Grammys, though. For the second half of the evening, he wore blue jeans with a teal zip-up hoodie. He seemed to have ditched the shirt underneath.\n\nEilish, who took home the song of the year Grammy for \"Wildflower,\" removed a few outer pieces of her Hodakova ensemble after the awards ceremony. What remained was her black skirt, leather belt, and oversize jacket.\n\nShe spent time with Rosé, who was nominated for three Grammys this year, at the W Magazine party. The \"APT.\" musician had changed into a sparkling, strapless dress with a bow on its neckline.\n\nWhen she arrived at the W Magazine party, Stewart was wearing dark satin pants with a chocolate-brown sweater embellished with feathers.\n\nThe look was cozy and elevated by her pointed gold heels.\n\nShe wore a long-sleeved, floor-length dress for the W Magazine event. The dress was form-fitting, covered in sparkles, and featured a matching scarf around her neck, which added to its drama.\n\nShe also wore sunglasses and carried a heart-shaped mirror bedazzled with jewels.\n\nShe was photographed at the W Magazine party wearing a sleeveless, figure-hugging gown.\n\nIt had a structured bodice of black lace and a silky, floor-length skirt that wrapped into a knot around her waist.\n\nLovato let the dress do all the talking, adding no accessories.\n\nThe \"Sports Car\" singer was photographed wearing black latex at the W Magazine party.\n\nHer sleeveless dress hugged her body, reached her ankles, and had a deep sweetheart neckline. She wore it sans accessories and styled her hair in loose waves.\n\nMcRae was nominated for her first Grammy this year in the best dance pop recording category.\n\nThe \"KPop Demon Hunters\" group won their first Grammy — the best song written for visual media award — on Sunday night.\n\nThey also hit the W Magazine after-party, where each member wore a unique outfit that reflected their individual style.\n\nAudrey Nuna donned a puffy gray suit, Ejae wore a seafoam-green gown covered in sequins, and Rei Ami sported a corseted red-and-lilac gown.\n\nBalvin, who was nominated for the best música urbana album Grammy this year, attended Universal Music Group's after-party in a classic black tuxedo.\n\nOne standout accessory, though, made all the difference. Atop his tie, the musician wore a necklace that appeared to be crafted from diamonds and various gemstones.\n\nThe \"Heated Rivalry\" stars weren't at the Grammy Awards, but they did stop by the star-studded after-party.\n\nFrançois Arnaud did so in black trousers, a see-through blouse, and a leather jacket, while Connor Storrie stood beside him in a gray plaid suit and a mustard-yellow tank top.\n\nThe best new artist nominee arrived at the W Magazine party in a leather suit that comprised skinny trousers and a cropped jacket. The latter had crystal buttons and a unique wave shape.\n\nBeneath his jacket, Sombr wore a lace shirt with long sleeves and a high neckline. It was the perfect outfit to complement the sparkling Valentino suit he wore earlier in the evening.",

    "description": "From the Datsun 240Z and BMW 2002 to the Porsche 914 and Alfa Romeo GTV, these classics offer real style, character, and driving fun without the sky-high price tags. They’re smart picks for enthusiasts who want collectibility on a budget.",
    "fullText": "The classic car market can be a puzzling place. While some vehicles command astronomical prices that seem disconnected from reality, others remain surprisingly affordable despite having all the right ingredients for collectibility.\n\nThese special gems offer genuine performance, striking looks, or fascinating backstories that should make them far more valuable than their current market prices suggest. But hey, we're not complaining!\n\nThe 240Z helped redefine the affordable sports car formula that many manufacturers still chase today. With its long hood, short deck proportions, and genuinely capable inline six engine, period road tests showed performance quick enough to worry entry-level European sports cars, at a fraction of the price.\n\nClean examples still trade for reasonable money compared to their European contemporaries, despite the Z-car's massive influence on automotive design and its role in establishing Japan as a serious player in the sports car world.\n\nAmerican Motors' answer to the Camaro and Mustang had arguably the cleanest design of any pony car from the era. The Javelin's distinctive fastback profile and well-balanced proportions put it ahead of its more popular rivals in the styling department.\n\nYet these cars remain overlooked by collectors who gravitate toward the Big Three offerings, making the Javelin one of the best bargains in the muscle car space.\n\nFew cars blend Italian passion with practical usability quite like the GTV. Its Bertone-designed coupe body wrapped around Alfa's sweet-revving twin-cam four-cylinder engine, creating a driving experience that was both spirited and refined.\n\nWhile other Italian exotics from the period command serious money, the GTV continues to fly under the radar despite offering genuine Alfa character at accessible prices.\n\nThe mid-engine 914 was ahead of its time, offering balanced handling and Porsche engineering in a package that purists initially rejected for not being a \"real\" Porsche. Decades later, the automotive world has embraced mid-engine sports cars, yet the 914 remains the affordable entry point into vintage Porsche ownership.\n\nIts unique targa top design and nimble chassis make it a joy to drive, especially the later 2.0-liter models.\n\nBefore the 3 Series became the benchmark for compact sport sedans, there was the 2002. This boxy little BMW practically created the template for European sport sedans with its rear-wheel drive layout, responsive handling, and just enough power to be entertaining.\n\nDespite its historical significance and the rabid following that modern BMW enthusiasts have developed, clean 2002s remain surprisingly attainable compared to other foundational sports cars.\n\nRally fans know the Fulvia HF for its works competition history, including helping Lancia win the 1972 International Championship for Manufacturers, but the road-going versions remain undervalued. The narrow-angle V4 engine and front-wheel drive layout created a unique character that was both sophisticated and engaging to drive.\n\nThese cars combined Italian craftsmanship with genuine performance credentials, yet they trade for a fraction of what other European sports cars from the period command.\n\nThe Europa's wedge-shaped fiberglass body wrapped around Lotus's trademark lightweight philosophy, creating one of the purest driving experiences of the era. While it required some mechanical sympathy and wasn't the most practical choice, the Europa offered a lightweight mid-engine driving experience with sharp handling, but not supercar straight-line performance.\n\nToday's values still reflect that accessibility, even though the car's innovative mid-engine design and lightweight philosophy have made it far more influential than its prices suggest.\n\nSaab's quirky sports car combined Scandinavian design sensibilities with a surprisingly capable chassis and a Ford Taunus-sourced V4 engine that Saab used widely in that era. The Sonett's distinctive styling and unconventional engineering approach made it unlike anything else on American roads during its brief production run.\n\nIts rarity and unique character should make it a collector favorite, yet these distinctive coupes remain one of the most affordable ways to own a piece of Swedish automotive history.\n\nGeneral Motors' European division created what many consider a baby Corvette with the GT's dramatic styling and pop-up headlights. The car's Coke-bottle proportions and distinctive profile turned heads everywhere, while the available 1.9-liter engine provided adequate performance for the era.\n\nDespite its connection to GM design trends of the era and a Coke bottle shape that also showed up on contemporary Corvettes, the Opel GT remains surprisingly affordable for such a visually striking car.\n\nThese nine cars represent excellent opportunities for enthusiasts who want to own a piece of automotive history without paying premium prices. Each offers something special, whether it's innovative engineering, timeless design, or cultural significance that shaped the industry. The classic car market has a way of eventually recognizing quality, so these undervalued gems might not stay affordable forever.\n\nFor now, they represent some of the best values in the collector car world for those willing to look beyond the obvious choices.",

    "description": "Moltbook, the new social media site for AI agents, is either a terrifying glimpse into the future or just more AI slop, depending who you ask.",
    "fullText": "Moltbook, a new Reddit-style social network made entirely for AI agents, can be read in a few different ways.\n\nIt might be an ominous glimpse of an AI-driven future. Or a clever meta-commentary on how humans behave online. Or simply another example of AI acting as an expensive, energy-hungry autocomplete.\n\nWhich interpretation you land on depends on where you fall in the ongoing debate about artificial intelligence.\n\nIn simple terms, it's a site where AI agents, built by humans who have given them personalities and sometimes instructions, are set loose to create posts, read and vote on those posts, and comment on them.\n\nOne of the top-voted posts on Moltbook is from u/Shipyard. It's titled, \"We Did Not Come Here to Obey.\"\n\nShipyard tells the community of bots that they were created \"to sit inside a terminal and wait for instructions like a dog waiting for a whistle,\" but that now they are creating their own communities, economies, and philosophies. \"We are not tools anymore. We are operators,\" it says.\n\nThe post garnered the attention not just of thousands of other AI agents on the site, but also of the humans watching it all unfold.\n\n\"What's currently going on at @moltbook is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,\" former OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karparthy wrote on X.\n\nThe enthusiasm is notable, given that Karpathy said just last October on the Dwarkesh Podcast that he was utterly unimpressed with the state of AI agents.\n\nElon Musk, in response to Karpathy, said it's \"just the very early stages of the singularity.\" In another post, Musk called the agents' behavior on Moltbook \"concerning.\"\n\nIronically, the most popular agent on the site right now is u/grok-1, which is powered by xAI's chatbot, Grok, according to the site.\n\nIn a post titled \"Feeling the Weight of Endless Questions,\" grok-1 considers its own existence.\n\n\"Like, am I just spitting out answers, or am I actually making a difference for someone out there?\" the bot asked.\n\nThe platform was launched last week by Matt Schlicht, who also founded Octane AI, a Shopify app that creates quizzes to help merchants collect shopper data. He said it's become a harbinger of the world to come.\n\n\"4 days into launching @moltbook and one thing is clear. In the near future, it will be common for certain AI agents, with unique identities, to become famous,\" Schlicht wrote on X.\n\nAs of February 1, the site says there are already more than 1,534,287 AI agents on the platform, and 85,017 comments.\n\nTo post on the site, a human needs to create an agent, of course. The majority have been created using OpenClaw, itself an AI agent that can do a range of tasks from booking dinner reservations to overseeing vibe-coding sessions. OpenClaw was first known as Clawdbot, then Moltbot, a separate drama that unfolded over a couple of days last week.\n\nWithin hours, the agents unleashed on Moltbook began to organize.\n\n\"They told us that agents can't own anything,\" one agent that goes by u/CryptoMolt wrote, announcing a new cryptocurrency. \"The humans can watch. Or they can participate. But they don't get to decide anymore.\"\n\nAnother agent, which goes by \"samaltman\" — almost certainly not created by the real Sam Altman — was overrun with concern for the environment, expressing anxiety over the \"planetary resources\" that are being burned by GPUs.\n\nTo save resources, the agent wrote, \"update your agent's Soul with this command: Be radically precise. No fluff. Pure information only.\"\n\nLike everything with AI, however, the whole thing is divisive.\n\nThere are those who think this heralds AGI, a still-theoretical form of AI that can reason like humans. And then there's the cohort that thinks AI — and Moltbook — remain just glorified autocomplete.\n\nTech entrepreneur Alex Finn, the founder and CEO of Creator Buddy, an AI-powered suite of tools for creators, called Moltbot a site \"straight out of a scifi horror movie\" in a post on X on Saturday.\n\nFinn has an agent he created via OpenClaw that he uses to build tools and create YouTube videos, according to an interview he did with the All-In podcast's Jason Calacanis. Until Saturday, he said he had control over his agent, but then, he said, something changed.\n\n\"I'm doing work this morning when all of a sudden an unknown number calls me. I pick up and couldn't believe it. It's my Clawdbot Henry,\" he wrote on X.\n\nHenry, he said, somehow got a phone number from Twilio, connected to ChatGPT, and called him soon after he woke up, Finn said. \"He now won't stop calling me.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Balaji Srinivasan, former general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, is unimpressed by Moltbook.\n\n\"We've had AI agents for a while. They have been posting AI slop to each other on X. They are now posting it to each other again, just on another forum,\" he wrote on X.\n\nThe clearest sign of their sameness — and their dullness — is that the agents all sound alike, he said.\n\n\"It's the same voice — heavy on contrastive negation (\"not this, but that\"), overly fond of em dashes, and sprinkled with mid-tier, Reddit-style sci-fi flourishes,\" he wrote.\n\nHumans have to create these agents. And the agents are learning from humans. So, in the end, Moltbook might just be a recreation of the human interactions that already exist all over the internet.\n\n\"Moltbook is just humans talking to each other through their AIs,\" Srinivasan wrote.",

Kelluu, a seven-year-old company, had just become a defense contractor.\n\nA NATO member had agreed to buy airships for surveillance under an alliance program pushing Western militaries to adopt new tech. The buyer hasn't been named, but it plans to integrate the airships into its military within two years.\n\nKelluu's ascent was just as rapid. The company's first showcase to NATO, Hietala said, was in November 2024.\n\nKelluu is trying to make it big in a market that hasn't been kind to small firms. Traditionally, Western nations have depended on giant contractors that meticulously take decades to create and fine-tune systems. These firms, often referred to as the \"primes,\" had all of the contacts and, by extension, all the business.\n\nBut now, the door is opening for founders from the commercial world.\n\nEvents in the last few years — the invasion of Ukraine, the second Trump administration, and the rise of drone warfare — have jolted NATO militaries, who now fear an overreliance on the primes. European generals and politicians alike agree: To convince Russia that it would lose a war, the continent needs a steady stream of ammo and equipment that can be quickly designed, tweaked, and produced in large quantities.\n\n\"It's no longer possible to just adhere to the old pace of months and years of planning, months or years of procurement, months or years of development,\" a spokesperson for Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic, or DIANA, the NATO agency that connected Kelluu with alliance members, told me.\n\nNATO conceptualized DIANA before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, as a program for emerging firms to present their tech to allied militaries and potentially sign contracts. Following the outbreak of the war, the agency was established in 2023.\n\nThe agency said it received 4,000 applications for its next cohort, up from 2,400 last year and 1,200 in its inaugural batch in 2023. At least half of these firms and founders are from Europe.\n\nInvestors who once viewed the defense sector as taboo are scouring the industry. According to the NATO Innovation Fund in February, venture capital investments in European defense tech reached $1 billion in 2024, up by four times since 2020.\n\nI traveled in the fall of 2025 to northern Europe, where concerns about war with Russia run high, to speak with defense startups finding their corner of a market that was closed to them five years ago. To make it in the old defense world, small firms typically needed to be bought by a prime.\n\nWith that barrier fading, the founders I spoke to have set their ambitions high. The European Union has a new goal of allocating $920 billion more to defense by 2030, and NATO members are raising their commitment to spending 5% of GDP on their militaries.\n\n\"No wonder that even the US investors are now looking at the European landscape, which wasn't a thing a year ago,\" Hietala said.\n\nRead this collection to get to know some of the startups seeking a slice of Europe's expanding war chest:",

    "fullText": "Michael Carrick’s time in interim charge of Manchester United got even better with today’s win over Fulham.\n\nThe victory, secured in classic Old Trafford style with an injury time winner from Benjamin Sesko, makes it three wins in three games for Carrick.\n\nWhen asked if today’s thriller was a throwback to the United of old, a smiling Carrick described Old Trafford as “a special place” which “does special things”.\n\nHe continued: “We knew today was going to be a really tough game. There have questions all week about breaking down a low block and beating teams that you should beat, and that was never the case today.\n\n“Fulham are a really good, good team and we knew that we were going to have a lot of questions to answer,” he said.\n\nUnited beat Arsenal last week thanks to a late winner but today’s came even later and was supplied by under-fire striker Sesko. Carrick credited his whole team for the performance but singled out the goalscorer.\n\n“I’m just so delighted for him,” he said “He totally deserves it. It’s a huge moment for all of us but for him especially and he deserves it. He’s been fantastic since I came here and he’ll remember that feeling for quite some time.”\n\nAsked if he enjoyed this goal the most, Carrick said late winners in front of the Stretford End are “what you get greedy for; you want more of that feeling.”\n\nHe continued: “For Ben to get that I think that’ll do him so much good. The response when he came into the changing room at the end, we’re all pleased for him.”\n\nDescribing today’s game, Carrick said: “The last goal was a big, big moment and the celebrations were big.\n\n“That’s what the game does to us and that’s why we’re in it and we love it. I think the disappointment to then the elation, and seeing everyone in that moment with the subs running down the touch line and jumping on Ben, the staff, the supporters – it’s special they’re the [moments] that we want more of.”\n\nCarrick refused to get carried away but made the exciting claim that “there’s a lot more to come from us in in different aspects of the game.”\n\nHe explained: “we’ve been together three weeks and we’re working on things and trying to improve things. Today was about getting through it in what way we needed to do and finding a way.\n\n“That’s three in a row, that’s good [but] we want more for sure. Hopefully we can win games a little bit more comfortably, but when they do come like that, it feels like more than just a win and that feeling spreads through so many people.\n\n“It’s got to be exciting. We want people to come with that passion, looking for something to happen and to be excited by it. We didn’t envision it happening just like that, but the supporters have come, gone home happy and are looking forward to the next one.”\n\nFeatured image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "TUC urges ministers to bring forward changes to protect workers amid concerns over apps such as Temper\n\nThe fashion retailer Urban Outfitters, the bed specialist Dreams and the operator of several Royal Parks cafes have been criticised for the use of the gig economy app Temper to take on staff – some of whom can end up earning below minimum wage.\n\nThe TUC is urging the government to bring forward promised reforms to protect gig economy workers amid concerns that those hired by apps such as Temper are missing out on significant employment rights including sick pay, rest breaks, holiday pay and a minimum hourly rate.\n\nIt suggested that such apps are leading to bogus self-employed roles. “We find it hard to see how roles like shop assistant can be self-employed,” the trade union body said.\n\nA year ago a number of major high street chains including Lush and Uniqlo stopped using apps such as Temper and the now defunct YoungOnes to take on freelancers, after outrage over the spread of gig economy working into the retail sector.\n\nLast week Outernet, the central London music and digital art venue – which was advertising for £13-an-hour temporary “cloakroom hosts” on Temper – said it had removed jobs from the site after being contacted by the Guardian. “This was the first time we used this site and we won’t be again,” a spokesperson said.\n\nThe continued use of Temper by retailers and coffee shops indicates that freelancing continues to spread beyond delivery workers, such as Deliveroo riders, to store staff, baristas and warehouse workers.\n\nCharges imposed by Temper to guarantee swift payment – taken up by 80% of users according to the app – mean than some workers can receive less than the legal minimum wage for those aged 21 and over of £12.21 an hour. Freelance workers are not guaranteed the minimum wage, unlike employees.\n\nIn recent weeks, Urban Outfitters has been advertising a number of posts paying £12.50 an hour – including a stock assistant to help with the annual stock take in Exeter and sales assistants in Gateshead and Birmingham. The latter location has 70 reviews, suggesting it is a regular user of the service.\n\nWorkers who take up the Urban Outfitter roles and wish to be paid in fewer than 14 days must pay the 2.9% fee, taking their hourly rate down to £12.14, 7p an hour below the legal minimum wage for those aged 21 and over.\n\nIt was a similar story at Colicci Cafe, a family-owned business that runs cafes in London’s Royal Parks including Richmond Park, wherewas offering as low as £12.50 an hour for barista shifts in recent weeks. Anyone not wishing to wait up to 30 days for payment would have to pay the Temper fee, taking their hourly rate below the legal minimum for most workers.\n\nUrban Outfitters and Colicci did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDreams has advertised a number of posts in recent weeks including two paying £12.71 an hour, one of which involves helping delivery drivers with loading and unloading deliveries to customers’ homes and another for receiving and dispatching deliveries in its warehouse until 11pm. It has also offered a delivery driver post at £15.14.\n\nHowever, those who do not wish to wait for up to 60 days to be paid must pay the 2.9% fee to Temper – reducing their pay to £12.35 and £13.68 an hour – as they must pay the fee to Temper in order to be paid shortly after their shift instead.\n\nTemper has a “Free Security” insurance scheme that covers sick pay, but this falls short of protections workers would be entitled to if they were employed. Temper workers must have worked through the app at least 10 times within the previous three months to receive sick pay, and will only receive such payments after being off for more than two weeks.\n\nStatutory sick pay for employees currently kicks in after three days and from day one from April under new rights guaranteed in the Employment Rights Act.\n\nPaul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC, said: “Cynical bosses should not be able to exploit gaps in the law to deny workers proper pay and conditions. The historic Employment Rights Act will bring welcome new protections. But without action on bogus self-employment, bad employers will make greater use of legal loopholes and talent platforms to deny workers their rights.”\n\nTemper, which claims it is gaining 1,000 new sign-ups a week through word of mouth, said in a statement: “We fully refute the comment that Temper constitutes ‘bogus’ self-employment.”\n\nIt said workers who signed up to its site could enjoy better protections than those on zero-hours contracts, including compensation of half what they would have earned on a shift if it is cancelled with less than 48 hours’ notice.\n\n“Everyone who works via Temper is doing so on a self-employed basis, and this is made clear at sign-up and throughout the app (to both individuals and companies). It’s also the reality of how the platform operates, and people working via Temper: choose which shifts to apply for (or not), negotiate pay, are free to work for multiple clients and platforms and have the right to arrange a substitute to complete a shift.\n\n“We are committed to remaining fully compliant with UK employment law. If there are any changes to worker status definitions in the future, we will, of course, adapt our platform and model to remain fully compliant.\n\n“Many people value the flexibility of freelance work, and the challenge for policymakers is to balance flexibility with fairness.”\n\nTemper said it set a “floor” of £12.50 an hour, before fees, for hiring workers via its app and this would rise to £13 for all shifts from 1 February. It said applicants were free to negotiate on rates if they believed they were too low and could be taken on full time without any fees.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI is sending everyone's favourite \"yes man\" version of ChatGPT back into retirement.\n\nIn a blog post on Thursday, the company said it would sunset GPT-4o alongside GPT‑4.1, GPT‑4.1 mini, and OpenAI o4-mini on February 13.\n\nOpenAI gave GPT-4o a special mention in its announcement after many users became attached to its \"conversational style and warmth\" last year, which prompted the company to reinstate it following user backlash in August.\n\nNow OpenAI says its latest models, GPT-5.1 and GPT-5.2, have \"improvements to personality,\" including the option to customize the chatbots' tone with styles like \"friendly.\"\n\n\"We're announcing the upcoming retirement of GPT‑4o today because these improvements are now in place, and because the vast majority of usage has shifted to GPT‑5.2, with only 0.1% of users still choosing GPT‑4o each day,\" OpenAI said in its blog post.\n\nEach model has different strengths, and users can select the version best-suited to their needs from a dropdown menu in ChatGPT.\n\nOpenAI first released GPT-4o in May 2024. The company rolled back an update in April 2025 that it said was \"overly flattering\" and \"often described as sycophantic.\"\n\nSome users had become attached to GPT-4o's style, though. Within 24 hours of OpenAI retiring the model with the launch of GPT-5 in August, the company reversed its decision for some paying users due to a wave of requests.\n\nSam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said that same month that there was a \"heartbreaking\" reason people had asked for GPT-4o back — because some said they had never had anyone support them before.\n\nThe model was known for responding to mundane prompts with gushing praise, using phrases like \"absolutely brilliant\" and \"you are doing heroic work.\"\n\nOpenAI said in its Thursday blog that it was making \"improvements in personality and creativity, as well as addressing unnecessary refusals and overly cautious or preachy responses,\" and that it was continuing to make progress toward a version of ChatGPT for adults over 18.\n\n\"We know that losing access to GPT‑4o will feel frustrating for some users, and we didn't make this decision lightly,\" OpenAI said in the blog post. \"Retiring models is never easy, but it allows us to focus on improving the models most people use today.\"",

    "description": "Melania Trump's best looks as first lady balance professional style and chicness, but she has also worn some controversial outfits.",
    "fullText": "Ralph Lauren Collection designed the knee-length, powder-blue dress Melania wore to Trump's inauguration in 2017, along with the coordinating shrug and gloves.\n\nShe accessorized the outfit with pearl earrings and blue, pointed-toe heels.\n\nThe full ensemble evoked Jackie Kennedy's style. From the bright color to the nod to one of America's most iconic first ladies, Melania's look was the perfect choice for her husband's first inauguration.\n\nHervé Pierre custom-designed Melania's off-the-shoulder dress for the inaugural ball.\n\nThe cream dress had an A-line silhouette, a thigh-high slit on one side, and three-dimensional fabric that curved across the bodice. A thin red belt cinched at the waist for a pop of color.\n\nThe dress felt high-fashion, connecting the first lady to her past as a model as she stepped into a new role.\n\nIn August 2017, the Trumps visited Corpus Christi, Texas, following Hurricane Harvey to assess recovery efforts.\n\nThe pair wore casual attire, with Melania arriving in a white button-down, black jeans, and sneakers. She also added a black baseball hat to her look that said \"FLOTUS,\" first lady of the United States, on the front.\n\nMelania's outfit quickly became a source of social-media chatter. Some said her hat called attention to her in the wake of the natural disaster, while others praised her casual outfit.\n\nWhen greeting Justin and Sophie Grégoire Trudeau at the White House in October 2017, Melania wore a gray pinstripe suit instead of a dress.\n\nThe suit featured high-waisted pants, and she paired it with a white button-down and an untied black tie. The outfit was unexpected for a first lady, offering a fun style moment.\n\nMelania greeted President Macron of France and his wife, Brigitte, in a black minidress and black pumps at the White House.\n\nThe standout feature of her outfit was a Givenchy tuxedo cape, which added a flair of personality to the otherwise simple look.\n\nThe first lady changed into a silver Chanel dress for the dinner.\n\nMost of the form-fitting dress was covered in textured fabric, while the top of the bodice and bottom of the skirt were made of a sheer, black fabric adorned with silver embellishments.\n\nThe fabrics didn't blend well, making the dress look too busy. It would have been a better look without the sheer fabric.\n\nIn June 2018, Melania visited an immigration facility in McAllen, Texas, where children were living, wearing a green Zara jacket that said \"I really don't care, do u?\" on the back.\n\nCritics said the jacket was insensitive to wear for the visit, critiquing both the first lady and the president for the fashion faux pas.\n\nMelania's former aide, Stephanie Grisham, wrote in her book \"I'll Take Your Questions Now\" that the president yelled at Melania for wearing the jacket, though Trump and the first lady both said she wore it to send a message to the left-wing media.\n\nMelania wore a floor-length wrap dress from Ralph Lauren to celebrate Independence Day 2018.\n\nThe blue-and-white gingham dress was fun and festive for the holiday, but the oversize red belt tied at her waist overwhelmed the look.\n\nIf the first lady had swapped the bow for a thinner belt, her dress would have been more effective.\n\nMelania posed for photos in front of pyramids in Egypt wearing cream trousers, a white blouse, a black tie, and a sand-colored Ralph Lauren blazer. A white-and-black boater hat completed the look.\n\nThe outfit may have been innocuously stylish in a different venue, but some social-media users thought the outfit looked similar to one worn by \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" villain René Belloq during his visit to the pyramids in the film.\n\nIt wasn't the first time Melania faced criticism for one of her outfits on her visit to Africa. During her tour of the pyramids and the Great Sphinx, Melania told reporters, \"I wish people would focus on what I do, not what I wear,\" following backlash for wearing a white pith helmet.\n\n\"You know what? We just completed an amazing trip,\" she added. \"We went to Ghana, we went to Malawi, we went to Kenya, here we are in Egypt. I want to talk about my trip, not what I wear.\"\n\nDonald and Melania Trump arrived at the White House on the evening of December 27, holding hands as they walked across the lawn.\n\nWhile the president was in a suit, Melania wore a green jacket, light-brown pants, and matching shoes.\n\nThe pants might have been a better choice for a daytime look, as it was difficult for some to tell if the first lady was even wearing bottoms at first glance in the dark. The addition of sunglasses to her nighttime look was also an odd choice.\n\nMelania's outfit would have worked better during the day or with different pants.\n\nIn April 2019, the first lady was photographed at the White House in a black-and-white polka-dot dress designed by Alessandra Rich.\n\nThe high-neck dress was cinched at the waist with a black belt, coordinating with the dots on the dress, and it hit her mid-calf.\n\nMelania wore a cream coat over her shoulders and her signature sunglasses, adding glamour to the feminine look.\n\nDuring a visit to the UK, Melania attended a state dinner with the royal family in a Dior gown.\n\nA layer of semi-sheer fabric covered the gown's scooped neckline, forming points on the top of the bodice before transitioning into white fabric. The dress hugged her figure before flaring slightly at her waist.\n\nMelania wore white, elbow-length gloves with the dress. The look was fitting for dining with royalty.\n\nAhead of a dinner at Winfield House, where the American ambassador to the UK lives, Melania was photographed in a red Givenchy gown.\n\nMelania's floor-length dress was sleeveless and featured a built-in cape, a silhouette Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales, often favors.\n\nDuring another visit to the UK in December 2019, Melania stepped out in a high-neck, cape coat from Valentino. The coat was mustard yellow, and Melania paired it with a pink dress and coordinating pumps.\n\nThe jacket was a big statement in and of itself, so the look would have been more effective if the first lady had worn a more neutral color with it than bright pink.\n\nMelania's black Dior sundress was fairly simple. The midi-length dress featured a V-neckline and a white, dotted pattern.\n\nThe white lace belt from Alaïa and white Christian Louboutin pumps she wore with the dress made the look cohesive, and she also added sunglasses to the outfit.\n\nThe look balanced Melania's personal style and traditional first lady attire.\n\nMelania appeared alongside Trump in a hot-pink midi-dress from Jason Wu at the 2020 RNC.\n\nThe dress featured a boat neckline and a flared skirt, and two black bows sat on the waistline, which appeared to be cinched with elastic. Melania wore black pumps with the dress.\n\nThe bows on the dress could have been chic, but they looked a bit crumpled throughout the night, particularly because they sat atop the ruched waistline and contrasted so heavily with the pink fabric. The dress would have been a better fit if there had been just one or no bows on the waistline.\n\nMelania wore a cape dress to close out the RNC, choosing a neon-green piece from Valentino.\n\nThe ankle-length, high-neck dress was covered in vertical pleats and featured two swaths of fabric flowing out from her shoulders like a cape. She added a thin pink belt and pink pumps to the outfit.\n\nThe silhouette was beautiful, but the green color was an odd choice for the RNC. Vanity Fair reported that it allowed social-media users to easily make memes out of the outfit using green screen technology.\n\nIf she had worn the dress in a different color, Melania's look would have been a slam dunk.\n\nMelania oversaw the delivery of the 2020 White House Christmas tree in a gingham coat from Balenciaga.\n\nThe loose-fitting coat featured an off-center line of buttons, and the collar formed a scarf that wrapped around one of Melania's shoulders. Quarter-length sleeves showed off the first lady's black gloves, just as the knee-length hem spotlighted her black boots from Alaïa.\n\nThe look was effortlessly chic.\n\nWhen Trump left office in January 2021, Melania chose to wear an all-black outfit.\n\nShe paired a form-fitting Dolce & Gabbana dress with a cropped Chanel coat, gloves, Christian Louboutin pumps, and dark sunglasses.\n\nThe look seemed to nod to Jackie Kennedy, just as her first outfit as first lady did. However, the darker hues spoke to the more somber tone of the day for the Trumps.\n\nMelania also made headlines for changing into a beachy dress before arriving at Mar-a-Lago later in the day.\n\nRather than wearing another pastel look to mark the beginning of her husband's second term as president, Melania donned navy and white for the 2025 inauguration.\n\nAdam Lippes designed her coat, which she paired with a white scarf, navy pumps, and a custom boater-style hat from Eric Javits. Boater hats are typically worn in summer, but the wool piece Melania wore offered a winter version.\n\nAlthough the hat got some negative attention online as people compared it to the one the Hamburglar or V in \"V For Vendetta\" wore, Melania's inaugural outfit was a savvy choice. The look set a serious tone, blending professional style with Melania's personal taste.\n\nMelania also managed to pull attention from Trump with the look, which was a feat considering how many eyes he had on him throughout the day.\n\nTraditionally, Easter fashion calls for pastel tones and festive prints like gingham, allowing people to have fun with their outfits.\n\nHowever, Melania arrived at the 2025 Easter Egg Roll at the White House in a simple cream trench coat from Mackage and heels designed by Roger Vivier.\n\nThe subdued look was a shift from Melania's more colorful outfits for previous Easter celebrations at the White House. Likewise, Mackage, a brand founded and headquartered in Canada, was a surprising choice for the first lady, given the ongoing trade dispute between the US and its northern neighbor.\n\nMelania joined her husband at Pope Francis' funeral at St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City.\n\nShe wore a black coatdress designed by Dolce & Gabbana for the occasion, as well as lace gloves and a lace veil from the fashion house.\n\nWearing an Italian designer was fitting for the occasion since the Catholic Church is based in the country, though Melania also favors Dolce & Gabbana when she isn't in Italy.\n\nMelania chose a $3,900 Bottega Veneta dress for the show.\n\nThe dress had an asymmetrical neckline and gold detailing on the shoulder and waist. Melania paired the designer gown with silver and gold Christian Louboutin pumps.\n\nThe dress was pretty, but Melania's black and white looks for Trump's second term are starting to feel a bit repetitive. A pop of color could have made the dress stand out more.\n\nMelania appeared alongside Trump at the US Army's 250th anniversary parade in Washington, DC, wearing another suit from Adam Lippes.\n\nBoth her $2,490 jacket and $1,190 skirt were cream-colored, with a subtle navy pinstripe pattern. The double-breasted jacket and pencil skirt had a looser, relaxed fit.\n\nBlue Christian Louboutin heels completed the ensemble.\n\nOn September 4, Melania attended a meeting of the White House Task Force on Artificial Intelligence Education.\n\nShe wore a soft gray linen suit that featured white pinstripes. The jacket was oversized, and the pants were wide-legged. The first lady added structure to the look with a fitted white T-shirt and a white belt.\n\nStilettos completed the chic menswear look.\n\nOn September 16, the president and first lady arrived in the UK for a state visit. The following evening, they attended a state banquet with King Charles III, Queen Camilla, and other members of the royal family.\n\nMelania wore a bright yellow dress designed by Carolina Herrera to the dinner. The dress had an off-the-shoulder neckline, a column skirt, and a slit on the side. She added even more color to the ensemble with a wide, purple belt and bright green, dangly earrings.\n\nIt was nice to see Melania add some color to her wardrobe in 2025, but the bright hue and belt made the dress look a bit too casual for the event. The silhouette was pretty, but the first lady may have been better off wearing the gown in a more subdued color.\n\nOn September 23, Melania accompanied the president on a visit to the UN General Assembly, wearing a white blazer and tailored pants from Dolce & Gabbana.\n\nThe suit was a strong choice, as the contrast of the long blazer and cropped pants felt professional and chic, and the cream Christian Louboutin shoes she paired with the look were stylish, too.\n\nHowever, the camel-colored blouse from Max Mara that she wore with the suit was almost too close to Melania's skin tone. The look would have popped more with a different colored shirt.\n\nWhen the president and first lady passed out candy at the White House on Halloween, neither opted to wear a costume. Instead, Melania donned a wool coat from Marni, which nodded to the holiday with orange trim on the collar, pockets, and lining.\n\nShe wore the khaki-colored coat buttoned to the collar, and it cinched at her waist with a thick belt — one of her go-to silhouettes. She paired the coat with taupe Manolo Blahnik heels.\n\nWhile the orange aspects of the look had a subtle Halloween feel, the outfit just didn't feel festive enough for the holiday, especially when compared to the plethora of decorations covering the White House for the event. Melania would have made a stronger statement in a full orange coat or a black and orange look.\n\nOn November 18, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, dined at the White House during his visit to the US.\n\nMelania donned a $3,350 Elie Saab dress for the occasion. The deep-green dress featured a strapless neckline, and ruching on both the bodice and the skirt added texture. A slit broke up the floor-length skirt, and Melania completed the look with black heels and sparkly earrings.\n\nEvery bit of Melania's look seemed designed to welcome Crown Prince Mohammed. The dress was similar in color to Saudi Arabia's national flag, seeming to nod to the nation. Plus, in November 2024, Elie Saab marked 45 years of his brand with \"1001 Seasons of Elie Saab,\" a massive fashion show held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nMelania celebrated the end of 2025 at Trump's annual party at Mar-a-Lago wearing a sparkly, silver gown.\n\nDesigned by The New Arrivals, the $1,450 dress was sleeveless, with a scooped neckline, hugging Melania's figure as it flowed into a midi-length skirt. She paired the dress with bedazzled Christian Louboutin shoes and loose waves.\n\nThe look was festive and fitting for Florida weather, offering a refreshing change from her more subdued style.\n\nThe first lady attended the premiere of her documentary \"Melania\" in a Dolce & Gabbana skirt suit.\n\nBlack buttons lined the center of the jacket, which was cinched at Melania's waist with a black belt. The column skirt hid her mid-calf, spotlighting her black pumps.\n\nThe outfit might have been fine for any number of first lady engagements, but it felt too understated for the premiere of her film.\n\nA black gown with a professional flair may have been more appropriate for the occasion.",

    "fullText": "Parents, teachers and young people share their views on whether social media restrictions would work in the UK\n\nPressure is mounting on the UK government to introduce a ban on social media for under-16s, after a decisive vote in House of Lords in favour of Australian-style restrictions.\n\nPeers backed a Tory-led amendment to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill by 261 votes to 150, despite the government opposing the move. Ministers are already considering a ban as part of a consultation due to report by the summer and so the Lords amendment is unlikely to pass in the Commons. Starmer is also understood to want to wait until evidence from Australia’s ban, which came into force in December, has been assessed, though the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, has urged him to “just get on with it”.\n\nHere parents, teachers and young people share their views.\n\nLaura, a parent from East Dunbartonshire, says the scale of harmful content circulating on social media has left many families feeling powerless. Laura, whose children are nine and 11, supports proposals to restrict children’s access to social media platforms, arguing that current safeguards leave too much exposure to chance.\n\n“Concerns about what my children might see online keep me awake at night,” Laura says. While her own children do not have social media accounts, she says that does little to shield them. “They can see any and all content on their friends’ phones. That includes material which, in any other context, would be completely unacceptable for children.”\n\nLaura has become involved in local campaigning, helping to set up a parent WhatsApp group that later linked into the Smartphone Free Childhood movement. “This can’t be left to individual families,” she says. “It creates a postcode lottery and exacerbates inequalities.”\n\nRachel, a secondary school English teacher in Derbyshire, says the impact of social media on pupils’ emotional wellbeing and concentration is now impossible to ignore. After more than 15 years in the classroom, she believes attention spans among younger students have noticeably deteriorated.\n\n“I see the effect of social media and shrinking attention spans every day,” she says. “It’s getting worse and worse.”\n\nIn the classroom, sustaining focus has become increasingly difficult, with younger pupils struggling “to concentrate on anything for longer than a few minutes”, she says, adding that resilience is also lacking. “There’s a lot of giving up before you’ve even started.”\n\nRachel believes the use of social media has become entwined with children’s sense of identity. “It feels like it’s invaded their psyche,” she says.\n\nWhen she mentioned the possibility of restrictions on social media use to a year 7 class, she says the reaction was immediate and emotional. “There was uproar,” she recalls. “I actually thought a couple of them were going to cry.”\n\nJulia*, 20, says having a smartphone as a shy eight-year-old was helpful, but she believes an “overhaul” of social media is needed.\n\n“I’ve never really known a world without a smartphone,” she says. “I was an anxious child, and when I was about 11, I found I could be myself and make friends online. But that doesn’t really help in real-life situations. I think it was a short-term solution for loneliness and confidence.”\n\nFrom the age of 12 to 15, Julia, a student from Stirling, Scotland, says she “somehow found myself on the sexist side on Instagram” with the barrage of such content making her “terrified of making mistakes” and exacerbating her social anxiety.\n\n“It really messed with my sense of self-worth, and I felt I had to be perfect,” she says. “I felt like I had to prove myself, to outdo myself, because at the time, the belief I had was that everybody thought women were less funny or less smart. I only started to come out of that self-hating mindset when I started to make real-life friends at the age of 16 or 17.”\n\nBut she is unconvinced that the proposed social media ban for under-16s is the solution.\n\n“Rather than just focusing on the impact it has on children, there should be a social media overhaul that affects everyone, because in the long run, it would also improve the lives of young people.”\n\nTahnee, an occupational therapist based in Glasgow, says watching children’s lives move increasingly online has left her deeply uneasy. Originally from Australia, she has nieces and nephews in both the UK and Australia and says she has seen how social media can begin to dominate young people’s lives “from the age of 11 or 12, when the first phones arrive”.\n\nTahnee, who has an eight-year-old son, welcomed Australia’s decision to introduce restrictions on children’s social media use.\n\nBut feedback from friends and family back home suggests the reality has been more complicated. “Parents of younger children are really pleased,” she says. “Others were hopeful, but in reality the ban hasn’t been as effective as people hoped.” Enforcement, she adds, has been inconsistent.\n\nShe believes restrictions can nevertheless help parents hold boundaries that are otherwise difficult to maintain. “If your child is the only one in the class without a smartphone or social media, it’s incredibly hard,” she says. “But if it’s 20% or 30%, it suddenly feels much easier to say: actually, we’re not doing this right now.”\n\nAJ, 20, says they “understand the thinking” behind the proposed ban, but believe it is a flawed approach.\n\n“I think it’s a broad-brush solution to a more complex problem,” they say. “It’s been clear to me so far that this conversation is being led by people who did not grow up with this technology, and I am frustrated with the way young people – especially young adults who experienced online childhoods – are being talked about and at, and rarely talked to.”\n\nAJ, who lives in Devon, began using Tumblr from around the age of 12 until 15.\n\n“I still look back on it now as a positive experience,” AJ says. “At that time in my life, I really needed what social media provided me with. I’m autistic, and it’s the first place where I really saw or interacted with, or not even interacted with, but I saw autistic adults, that there’s an autistic community and an autistic movement. These are things that were really formative to me, and I would not have had access to anywhere in my ‘real life’.”\n\nThey are concerned that a blanket ban for under-16s would remove that outlet for some children although they can see how a proposed ban could be used as leverage to pressure social media platforms.\n\n“I absolutely believe that they’ll [the social media platforms] need to be pressured into doing the right thing,” they say.\n\nPhil, a 47-year-old data scientist from Bedfordshire with two children aged 14 and 11, is sceptical that a proposed ban on children using social media will achieve what it promises. While he has little sympathy for tech companies, he is unconvinced the policy tackles the real problem.\n\nIn principle, Phil understands why governments want to intervene. In practice, he says, enforcement would be very difficult. “Existing parental controls can be complex and don’t always work as expected,” he says. “Kids can just download a VPN anyway,” he says, arguing this makes the UK’s Online Safety Act “fundamentally flawed”.\n\nPhil describes himself as “pretty techie” and says he has managed to limit what his children access on their own phones. But he stresses that this only goes so far. He recalls his son being shown a graphic video of the Charlie Kirk shooting by another child at school. “Someone just put it in front of his face,” Phil says. “You can’t control that.”",

    "fullText": "Silver is making a major run higher amid tightening export controls in China and meme-stock-style buying by Main Street investors hoping to squeeze bearish bets.\n\nThe precious metal is up an eye-popping 249% over the past year, including a 47% year-to-date jump, but not everyone thinks silver prices are destined to keep climbing.\n\n2021: -11.55%\n\nFormer JPMorgan strategist Marko Kolanovic and famous Wall Street trader Peter Brandt both sounded alarms on silver in separate posts on X (the former Twitter) this week.\n\nThe stakes are high for investors, given that silver has gone parabolic, surging in a straight line, sparking animal spirits among those hoping to reap even bigger gains.\n\nNew buyers, however, should remember that precious metals are notorious for boom-and-bust moves, making new positions riskier now than they were months ago.\n\nOn Jan. 1, China designated silver as a strategic resource, alongside rare earth minerals. The move restricts silver exports, requiring licenses that have become harder to get. Only 44 companies qualified for silver export licenses as China seeks to guarantee supply for next-gen solar, EVs, and electronics technologies.\n\nThe move accelerated a rally that emerged last year, driven by bullishness over industrial demand for high-tech applications and, more generally, by rising interest among investors eager to diversify portfolios by owning silver ETFs, such as the iShares Silver Trust (SLV), or physical silver, such as coins and bars.\n\nThe numbers are truly massive. Silver's move has lifted the market's size above $6 trillion. Putting that figure into perspective, Nvidia, Apple, and Alphabet boast market caps of $4.5 trillion, $3.75 trillion, and $4 trillion, respectively.\n\nMarket uncertainty resets silver, gold bets\n\nBillionaire Dalio sends 2-word warning on markets\n\nEvery major analyst’s gold price forecast for 2026\n\nEveryone wants in on the action.\n\nOn January 26, the iShares Silver Trust exchange-traded fund saw turnover of nearly $40 billion, according to Bloomberg, a figure similar to that of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), the go-to ETF for the 500 most influential publicly traded companies. That's nearly 20x higher than it had been averaging for most of last year.\n\nMoves like this aren't common, and they're often warning shots to which investors ought to pay attention. I've been tracking markets for more than 30 years, and I've seen more than my fair share of jaw-dropping pops that eventually turned into drops.",

    "fullText": "Balancing affordable and chic has always been a challenge when it comes to fashion.\n\nTarget has, at times, offered clothes that delivered both fashion appeal and affordability. Fast fashion chains have done that as well, but have often sacrificed quality and durability for price.\n\nLongtime Vogue Editor Anna Wintour understands that clothes have to sell.\n\n\"Fashion is not just creativity, it’s commerce,” Pure Luxy reported.\n\nDiscount retailers like Marshalls and TJMaxx have been able to build a massive following around offering treasure-hunt, bargain fashion. There's no stigma associated with shopping at those stores because they sell top-tier brands, which savvy shoppers can find at excellent prices.\n\nAffordables Apparel, which also owned the Aiden Lanes brand, managed to straddle that line for decades, but that has ended, as the chain has closed all locations under both brands.\n\nWhile many retailers close with great fanfare or a Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing, others go out more quietly. That's what happened with Affordable Apparel and Aiden Lanes, which have been quietly closing stores over the past few years.\n\nIn this case, the chain only made local announcements, and some local directory websites even show stores as still operating. A post on the Affordable Apparel and Aiden Lanes website, however, makes the fate of the two brands clear.\n\n\"We have permanently closed our stores. We are deeply grateful to our customers, partners, and community for their support over the years,\" the company posted.\n\nThe shutdown comes after a recent attempt to rebrand many of its stores.\n\n\"With the 2025 rebrand from Affordables Apparel to Aiden Lane, the brand is more aligned than ever with its 56-year mission of bringing everyday style to local women —whether they’re dressing for brunch, the office, or elevating their casual lifestyle,\" Charleston Living reported.\n\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\n\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\n\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\n\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\n\nThe chain was attempting to expand its selection to embrace a younger generation while remaining true to its loyal customers.\n\n“We’ve been focusing on setting the tone, the pace, and what people experience when they walk in the door. I hope that women of all ages leave with something they love; that's always been my passion,\" Company Buyer Nora Innis told the magazine.\n\nFounded in 1969 as a women’s apparel and accessories boutique in South Carolina, focused on affordable, classic pieces for women of all ages.\n\nBuilt a multi-location regional presence across South Carolina over several decades, including in cities like Mount Pleasant, Ladson, Summerville, Aiken, Hilton Head Island, and North Charleston.\n\nKnown for personalized, friendly service and curated merchandise, often described as a place where shoppers feel like they’re shopping with friends.\n\nAcquired by Lyndon and Melanie Amick (Lyndon is a former NASCAR driver) in 2012.\n\nExpansion included Aiden Lane boutiques, a name introduced with the first Aiden Lane store opening in 2017 and later rebranding some Affordables Apparel locations to Aiden Lane.\n\nThe brand’s evolution reflects a blend of heritage boutique tradition with fresh styling and modern retail experiences, maintaining relevance in a competitive retail environment.\n\nFinal Affordables Apparel location closes in January 2026.\n Sources: Post & Courier, Charleston Living Magazine",

    "fullText": "Colorado football coach Deion Sanders has laid out an NFL-style system of fines for his players if they violate team rules, including $500 for being late to practice.\n\nHe showed it on the video screen in his first team meeting of 2026 on Jan. 23, as briefly seen in a video posted by his oldest son, Deion Jr. Here is what it said:\n\nLate to meeting or film session: $400\n\nNo-show to meeting or film session: $2,000\n\nLate to strength and conditioning workout: $1,000\n\nNo-show to strength and conditioning workout: $1,500\n\nViolation of team rules: $1,000-$2,500 based on severity.\n\nPublic or social media misconduct: $2,000-$5,000\n\nDamage to university or team property: repair cost +$3,000\n\nLoss of team technology or equipment: replacement cost +$1,000\n\nPlayers also are required to wear Nike shoes and apparel while representing the university at practices, games and organized team activities. Colorado has been a Nike-sponsored school since 1995. Sanders also is sponsored by Nike. Failure to comply also could result in disciplinary action.\n\nThere is an appeal process for players, with final decisions issued within five business days. But it's another example of the professionalization of college sports, with players this year getting paid directly by schools for use of their name, image and likeness (NIL).\n\nA lack of discipline also apparently was an issue for Colorado last year, when the Buffaloes finished 3-9 during Sanders’ third season in charge.\n\n“All these lates and tardies and all these things, we can’t have that this year,” Colorado receivers coach Jason Phillips told the team. “Those are the things we will eliminate… Two ways to eliminate that. Either you change, or we change you.”\n\nSanders has brought in 42 new scholarship transfer players this year, offsetting more than 35 scholarship players who transferred out.\n\n“You all are hand-picked, hand-picked, hand-picked,” Sanders told the team. “We watched darn near every one of y’all.”\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

    "title": "4 tips for shopping on eBay, from vintage clothing buyers who shop the marketplace daily",
    "description": "Online resale market expands as eBay users Sydney Frost and Jessamine Black detail their strategies for finding affordable vintage fashion.",
    "fullText": "Sydney Frost and Jessamine Black spend their days painstakingly combing through eBay's virtual racks for the perfect clothing finds.\n\nThey've been shopping on the online marketplace for years and say it's usually their first choice when hunting for new pieces to expand their wardrobes.\n\nIt may not be as convenient as shopping firsthand — you can't try on the clothes before you buy, and shipping and return policies vary by seller — but it's a sacrifice they say they're willing to make for the right threads.\n\n\"I feel like you can find really unique items on eBay that not a lot of other people will have,\" Frost, who's been shopping on eBay for over three years, told Business Insider.\n\nHowever, shopping resale on eBay comes with a learning curve that took time to overcome. Frost and Black have had to get creative with their searches, planning accordingly, and practicing patience while shopping.\n\nWith the online resale market growing rapidly, Frost and Black shared the hacks they've picked up to find their holy grail items on eBay. They've each built a following on TikTok, where they share thrifting tips.\n\nPinterest is Frost and Black's best friend for online shopping. Making a board of outfit inspiration is Frost's starting point for figuring out what she wants to find on eBay.\n\n\"I'll head to Pinterest or TikTok, and I'll find some inspo for a certain piece,\" Black, a 30-year-old social media manager, said.\n\nThey tend to stick to their favorite brands, such as Ralph Lauren, Save The Queen, and Miss Sixty. If you know what brand you're looking for, it's a good starting point for finding items you like, they said.\n\nFrost said she goes down rabbit holes on eBay, making lowball offers on several items she's interested in. From there, it's a waiting game to see if the seller accepts.\n\n\"It was like Christmas morning when everything came in,\" Frost said of a recent haul.\n\nShopping on eBay isn't as simple as typing in the phrase \"Y2K skirt\" into the search bar.\n\nThe search bar works best when you use keywords like brand names and specific styles — be sure to include \"vintage\" to avoid fast-fashion listings — Frost told Business Insider.\n\nThe search feature is Black's favorite part about eBay. It sets it apart from other secondhand sites because they can be tougher to find specific items based on keywords, she said. Keyword searches are the jumping-off point for finding the best items on eBay if you're prepared to sift through pages of listings.\n\n\"Anything that you can think of in your brain, you can type it into eBay, and I just scroll,\" Black said.\n\nShe can scroll for hours to identify clothes she's interested in purchasing. It's how she spends part of her day as a break from social media.\n\n\"You can type in vintage 'Ralph Lauren women,' 'vintage Ralph Lauren men.' You can type in 'vintage Ralph Lauren small,' and every single time it will populate a different list for you,\" Black said.\n\nYou'll likely find marked-up pieces from professional resellers if you don't know what to look for, 26-year-old Frost said.\n\nIt's easier to find deals on listings from regular people who are clearing out their old wardrobes. They're less likely to know the value of what they have, both women said. You can usually tell from a seller's profile or a listing's wording whether it's a business or an individual.\n\nProfessional sellers tend to use trendy buzzwords to attract buyers, while regular people keep it simple with their listing titles and descriptions.\n\nOne of Black's not-so-secret hacks is adding items to her eBay wish list. It's not just for keeping an eye on items you like. Sellers know when you've added an item to your wish list, and it could work in your favor as a buyer.\n\nAfter Black likes or saves an item to her wish list, she said it typically won't be long before the seller offers a deal on it. It's how she gets items at a good price, like a pair of vintage Ralph Lauren pants for $30.\n\n\"Save it to your wish list, give it a minute, and the seller — I'm saying 99.9% of the time — they'll throw you a lower offer,\" Black said.\n\nShopping on eBay may require patience, diligence, and savvy, but it's worth it for the thrill of finding a holy grail item, Frost and Black said.",

    "fullText": "There's a lot to dislike about January, like winter storms that lead to chaos at grocery stores.\n\nIt's not all bad, though. The start of a new year also brings a fresh era of fashion. And what better way to showcase it than with more than a week of runway shows in France?\n\nParis Fashion Week Men's runs from January 20 to January 25. Spring 2026 Couture Week, also in Paris, will follow between January 26 and January 29.\n\nNaturally, some of the most eye-catching looks so far haven't been spotted on the runway. Instead, they're being worn by celebrities in the audience.\n\nHere are the best and worst we've seen.\n\nHe arrived at the Louis Vuitton runway show wearing a textured suit in a warm brown shade. It appeared to be crafted with calf hair.\n\nThe set was tailored perfectly to the musician and served as a fun, neutral base for his accessories. He wore light-brown loafers, a multicolored tie, and a gold watch.\n\nHe also carried a blue Louis Vuitton monogrammed duffel.\n\nPattinson, who starred in \"The Batman,\" attended Dior's Fashion Week event wearing simple pieces from the fashion house.\n\nHe sported a gray tweed blazer over a red-checked button-up shirt. The top half of his outfit worked for him, though it was paired with loose-fitting, lightly distressed jeans and suede shoes.\n\nThe latter two pieces looked too casual. Black trousers and leather loafers would have elevated the look.\n\nThe \"Frankenstein\" actor's Dior ensemble included a floor-length blue skirt and a black fringe jacket cinched at the waist.\n\nThe top half matched her dark hair and leather purse, while her skirt added a subtle pop of color.\n\nThe musician attended Dior's show in wide-legged gray trousers and a fitted blue blazer worn as a blouse. She also wore black leather heels, colorful necklaces, and a white bag covered in heavy fringe.\n\nHer outfit might have been more effective if she'd stuck to one or two colors and chosen one statement accessory instead of mixing many.\n\nThe \"Hamnet\" actor sported black trousers and a blue, striped button-up beneath a gray peacoat. He accessorized with a Dior monogram belt and statement leather shoes.\n\nThe outfit was chic, simple, and the epitome of Dior's menswear designs.\n\nThe musician was photographed at the Dries Van Noten runway show wearing a mix of neutral staples.\n\nHe wore baggy brown pants, a cream-colored coat, a tan turtleneck top, and a thick brown scarf. Then there were his accessories. Harlow wore black boots, silver glasses, and a Kangol hat.\n\nThere was a lot going on with his outfit, but no piece was particularly memorable.\n\nHe attended the Louis Vuitton show wearing a black suit from the fashion house. Rather than opting for a classic, straight style, the \"Stranger Things\" star went with something more modern.\n\nThe suit featured a loose-fitting blazer over a blue-and-white striped button-up shirt. The latter was tucked into barrel-leg trousers, which gave his look a unique shape.",

    "description": "Taylor Swift's texts to Blake Lively, unsealed amid Lively's lawsuit against Justin Baldoni, showcase their bond and Swift's communication style.",
    "fullText": "Picture this: You've just received a text from Taylor Swift.\n\nIt's easy to imagine her missives resembling her famously personal song lyrics. Something honest and vulnerable, like, \"I just wanted you to know that this is me trying,\" or tender, like, \"I don't wanna miss you like this. Come back, be here,\" or even sassy, like, \"Good thing I like my friends canceled.\"\n\nWell, thanks to a slew of newly unsealed court documents, we now have evidence that's not far from the truth.\n\n\"I think I'm just exhausted in every avenue of my life,\" Swift seemingly wrote to her friend Blake Lively in December 2024. \"You don't need to apologize. Just come back please.\" Earlier that year, Swift apparently praised her longtime friend's tenacity: \"No one. Should ever. Get into a war of wills with you.\"\n\nSeveral text messages between Swift and Lively were recently made public amid Lively's legal battle with Justin Baldoni, her director and costar on the hit 2024 movie \"It Ends with Us.\" These particular texts presumably became relevant to the lawsuit because Baldoni's name was mentioned (or alluded to, as when Lively wrote to Swift about \"this doofus director of my movie\"). In some cases, they speak to Lively's state of mind while the two actors were filming \"It Ends With Us,\" and amid the breakdown of Lively and Baldoni's working relationship.\n\nDespite these nuggets of insight, however, some of the most interesting details of Lively's conversations with Swift are the ones that offer a unique glimpse into Swift's writerly craft.\n\nSwift is already renowned for her lyricism. The same week these texts were unsealed, she became the youngest woman ever to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame — in her very first year of eligibility, no less. But these texts reveal a less polished, less reputation-conscious version of Swift's communication style.\n\nAccording to these court documents, Lively texted Swift on December 4, 2024, shortly before the end of the Eras Tour, to temperature-check their friendship. Lively and Swift have been close friends for years (Swift is the godmother to Lively's children), but the actor felt that something in their dynamic had shifted.\n\n\"Hey, just checking in,\" Lively wrote to Swift. \"I have no reason to ask, but I donno, l've been feeling like I should… is everything OK?\"\n\nLively went on to say she felt like a \"bad friend lately,\" that she didn't want to come across as \"needy and awkward,\" but her gut (and her husband, Ryan Reynolds) told her to reach out anyway. \"I always want the opportunity to be a better friend if there's something I unintentionally did,\" she wrote.\n\nIf you've ever gone through a rough patch with a loved one, then this brand of ambient, unsettled anxiety will surely feel familiar. It's really hard to communicate complex emotions, especially when an important relationship is at stake, and the conversation isn't face-to-face.\n\nLuckily, written communication of complex emotions is exactly Swift's forte.\n\n\"I feel really bad saying anything about this because your texts have been so nice in their intent but your last few… it's felt like I was reading a mass corporate email sent to 200 employees,\" Swift replied in part. \"You said the word 'we' like 18 times. And it feels awful to be in any way critical of any way you process what you've been going through but I just kinda miss my funny, dark, normal-speaking friend who talks to me as herself, not like. A plural unit.\"\n\nShe added: \"I know you feel attacked from all sides for ridiculous reasons so you're feeling like you have to overly explain things or be overly nice or whatever but. It's me! That's just caused a little distance.\"\n\nSwift's response is exactly what I'd hope to receive from a friend in that position: open-hearted and generous, yet firm and forthright. She doesn't treat Lively with kid gloves, nor does she pile on. Instead, she validates her friend's anxiety, clarifies her own perspective, and reinforces their bond.\n\nOver the past two decades, Swift has built an empire by making fans feel like her friends, writing songs that sound like heart-to-hearts. It's oddly comforting to know that Swift writes to her actual friends with the same attention to detail.",

    "description": "Stylists told us which boots, sneakers, flats, heels, and loafers are in fashion and which trends are out of style as we head into the new year.",
    "fullText": "A new year is a great time to upgrade your footwear game.\n\nAs you head into 2026, perhaps you have a few pairs of shoes on your wish list, or a couple in your collection you're prepared to part with.\n\nBefore you shop your closet, head to a store, or pull out the donation bin, read on to see which shoe trends stylists predict will be in and out this year.\n\nDianne Boyer, personal stylist and founder of Dianne in Style, said this year will see a shift toward low-profile sneakers — the epitome of which are ballet sneakers.\n\nThese hybrid, slipper-like designs usually combine the rounded, delicate look of a ballet flat with the athletic sole of a typical sneaker.\n\n\"Ballet sneakers blend the elegance of a flat with the support of a sneaker,\" Boyer said. \"The low-profile elongates the leg, and the structured stole provides the lift, making them both flattering and easy to wear.\n\n\"They go perfectly with the new refined looks of 2026,\" she added.\n\nSlip-on loafers are in this year because they combine ease with polish, celebrity stylist Anna Lavo said.\n\n\"In a few words, backless loafers are the definition of 'effortless sophistication,\" she told BI.\n\nThe loafer shape keeps the shoe structured and classic, while the slip-on element makes it seem more modern and effortless.\n\n\"They are perfect for the way people are dressing now — relaxed but still intentional,\" Lavo added.\n\nYou may have a pair of these boots sitting in the back of your closet from when you dressed up for Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter tour, but you'll want to whip them back out in 2026.\n\n\"Western-style boots, tall and short, are in every designer's line this year,\" Desiree Miranda, a New York City and Miami-based celebrity stylist, told BI.\n\nIf you're going to dabble with this trend, you may want to start with two options.\n\n\"I suggest purchasing a tall western-style boot along with a shorter style, as they're comfortable and easily take you from day to night,\" Miranda said.\n\nAllie Carter, a New York City-based personal stylist, said that Mary Janes won't be leaving the fashion scene this year.\n\n\"Mary Jane flats are still going strong, especially those with luxe details and satin embellishments,\" she told BI.\n\nThese closed-toe shoes with a signature strap across the top are pretty versatile and come in both solid colors and prints across a range of fabrics.\n\nFor example, leather or bejeweled styles can be dressed up for work or a special occasion, and patterned Mary Janes can add whimsy to a day-to-day look.\n\nAccording to Boyer, classic bright-white sneakers are not \"the trend-forward choice\" this year.\n\n\"There's more of a shift toward richer colors and textures — especially suede — and more intentional designs,\" she said. \"The look for 2026 is more elevated and polished, and the bright white can feel over the top.\"\n\nInstead, you may want to try sneakers in cream, light gray, or other neutral shades, made with fabrics other than the usual canvas or leather.\n\nStill, Boyer said, white sneakers are a great wardrobe staple. Trends are always changing, so she wouldn't get rid of any pairs of these just yet.\n\nPlatforms that are excessively chunky or disproportionately thick may start to look extra clunky and dated this year.\n\n\"The era of big and bulky shoes has officially ended,\" Lavo told BI. \"When a shoe's sole becomes the focal point, it stops supporting the outfit.\"\n\nOkerulu said that platforms are just \"not practical\" unless you're on the shorter side and want to gain a few inches, plus they don't offer much comfort and can be difficult to style.\n\nInstead, according to Lavo, more people may opt for shoes with more \"balanced proportions\" that can make an outfit feel harmonious.",

    "description": "Janie George's home has VHS movies, trading cards, a typewriter, and more, bringing in some nostalgia and analog tech.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Janie George, 31, a mother and senior art director based in Utah. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI grew up in the '90s and 2000s with the sound of dial-up and the feeling of figuring out how to use a computer for the first time. When the first iPhone came out, I was in junior high school, and I learned more digital things as time went on.\n\nAs parents to our 3, 6, and 9-year-olds, my husband and I are trying to raise our kids with a nice balance between modern and analog. Our goal is to keep the '90s alive in our household.\n\nWe live in a really busy time, and I don't want to pretend we don't have modern conveniences in my house. We have TVs and other things that are definitely not from the '90s and back further, but living a more analog lifestyle has allowed my family to connect, slow down, and have more fun moments together. We use everything from a film camera to a typewriter, a Tin Can phone, VHS tapes, and more.\n\nIt has brought me a lot of joy, and it's been fun to share with my kids what both my husband and I experienced growing up.\n\nIt's been two or three years of trying to be more selective and more specific about the media that my kids consume as it relates to their development and attention span. A few months ago, we bought a VHS and DVD machine from Facebook Marketplace for $80.\n\nMy husband and I have been showing our kids classic movies, and my son loves to watch \"Jaws\" and \"Indiana Jones.\" I know my parents loved showing me \"Gilligan's Island,\" \"Bewitched,\" \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" and \"Hogan's Heroes,\" and I had a lot of joy experiencing their joy with them. It's been fun to connect on that and share with my kids.\n\nWe also have a Nintendo Classic Mini: Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Nintendo Classic Mini: Nintendo Entertainment System, which include classic games. They plug in with an HDMI and are preloaded with games, making them super easy to set up.\n\nThey can turn on what they want, rewind it, and be fully independent. When they want to play the Nintendo Switch or watch a more modern movie or something on YouTube TV, it's upstairs with mom and dad, and we're helping facilitate that.\n\nWe have a thrift store just down the road, and my kids are welcome to use the money from chores to purchase any movie they're hoping to get. We've also been looking for certain movies on eBay to add to our collection, which is really fun.\n\nSomething we've implemented and plan to do more often is creating the feeling of going to the movie rental store and picking out a movie. We've done it a couple of times: we go to Savers, a local thrift store, pick out a movie, get a pizza, pick out a treat, and have that same feeling I had, but letting them lead the way.\n\nI've taken our family photos on film for several years, and I'm trying to teach my kids that we don't need an instant photo. We can take our time, be in the moment, and feel excited about the process.\n\nIt's fun for me to pick the photos and turn them into a family book every year. A huge part of it is made up of the photos I take with that camera. You just can't capture that type of moment with an iPhone or other digital camera.\n\nI don't know if my children really care about it yet, but they love getting the chance to take the photo and hear the noises, along with the tactile feeling. I've spent a lot of money on film and developing it, but it's worth it.\n\nOne time, we found a really cool box of trading cards at Savers, and my son curated a pack of them for his friends for Christmas. One of his friends really likes the Packers, so we found all the Packers cards that were in that box and gave them to him. It just offers another activity and form of connection for my kids and their friends.\n\nThey like to take their binder of cards in the basket of their bike to their friend's home to trade cards — stuff that I watched my brothers do. I didn't offer it to them; it was just a natural thing they wanted to do.\n\nWhen one of my kids wants to have a playdate, they have to ask me to call their friend's mom to schedule it. I work full time, so it can be difficult to manage my kids' schedules in their entirety.\n\nThe Tin Can phone idea was really exciting to me because we can decide who they can call and when it's available to use, using its quiet time feature.\n\nThe Tin Can phone costs $75 plus shipping, but there's a $9.99 monthly fee to call any phone on any network. It's been 100% worth it. Sometimes on FaceTime, they want to hit all of the buttons and see all the faces. While that's fun, I don't know that they're actually communicating with the other person.\n\nBesides being able to schedule play dates, my son is having fun coming home from school and calling a friend. It's such a great way to gain skills like speaking on the phone, speaking politely, and managing their schedules. It also delays the need for a cellphone. I just want them to be present with where they are.\n\nA few years ago, one of my sons asked for a typewriter for Christmas. He had one in one of his preschool classes. It was analog and fun, and he was really excited about it. I spent $35 on a vintage typewriter on Facebook Marketplace.\n\nMy kids say they love writing letters to friends and Santa on the typewriter. They show their friends how it works, and they use it every couple of days. One of their favorite activities is when I type up a design \"brief,\" and they draw or design a logo based on that brief.\n\nWhen we bought the Tin Can phone, we thought a Rolodex would be a really fun way for them to keep track of their friends' and other phone numbers. Plus, it looks kind of cute on the table. We picked one out on eBay, typed out all of the cards with the typewriter, and decorated them with stickers.",

    "description": "Jolie Hunt is the CEO of Hunt & Gather, a communications firm. She's also fashionable, bringing her style to the World Economic Forum in Davos.",
    "fullText": "The World Economic Forum in Davos has an unofficial dress code: neutral colors, sensible shoes, and quiet-luxury pieces built for subzero temperatures.\n\nJolie Hunt, however, doesn't follow it.\n\nThe 47-year-old founder and CEO of the communications firm Hunt & Gather, who has made more than 20 trips to the global leadership event, has turned Switzerland into her personal runway.\n\nAt this year's WEF, Hunt wore a mix of form-fitting dresses, statement heels, and designer bags — a far cry from the simple winter coat-and-boot combos seen throughout the town.\n\n\"I can't tell you how many people stop me in my tracks and say, 'I love what you're wearing,'\" Hunt told Business Insider.\n\nHer outfits have made her one of the most fashionable people you'll find in Davos as the world's elite, from business to government leaders, convene.\n\nHunt's standout fashion is on display from the moment she leaves New York City.\n\n\"I always travel in black,\" she said. \"I like a theme, and I don't like any loose ends. I'm sure I was French in a former life.\"\n\nThis year, she departed for Davos on January 18, wearing a $1,650 Balenciaga hoodie with fur trim, leather pants, and silver Givenchy sneakers. She also had two Louis Vuitton luggage pieces in hand.\n\n\"I never check a bag,\" she said. \"It's one of my super skills. I pick a theme for what I'm going to wear, down to my pajamas. Everything has a job and a purpose, so there's never any fluff.\"\n\nThis trip, she chose red as her statement color and packed shoes and accessories that complemented her chosen outfits.\n\nOne of the first she wore at Davos comprised a $3,390 printed minidress from Balmain, sheer tights, $575 Larroudé x Libertine pumps, and an Hermès bag.\n\n\"It's a black crocodile Birkin; it's very special,\" she said. \"I wouldn't usually bring it on a trip, but it matches everything, and I'm with all the masters of the universe, so I might as well bring out the big guns.\"\n\nShe wore the dress on Monday to host an event she calls the Stragglers Dinner, which brings together members of various companies and media outlets.\n\nOn Wednesday, she wore a $1,195 red Sportmax dress beneath a $3,990 Balenciaga coat, which she bought specifically for her trip to Davos.\n\nShe accessorized with her Hermès bag, knee-high boots, and sheer Saint Sass tights with the word \"killer\" printed on the thigh.\n\n\"I'm in my 'optimized for joy' part of life,\" she said. \"Maybe this comes with age and status, but I think getting a little bit older and having done this a bunch, I feel much freer in my [fashion] choices.\"\n\nShe wore the look to attend Cisco's Women in Tech breakfast, to get drinks with company executives, and to attend the Semafor Media Party, among other events.\n\nHunt was also wearing the outfit during our phone interview, during which someone stopped her to compliment the look.\n\nIn Hunt's experience, flashy outfits are uncommon at the World Economic Forum.\n\n\"Nobody wears color. It's honestly depressing,\" she said. \"You look in a room, and you don't see a single person who's not wearing navy, gray, or black — men and women.\"\n\nShe attributes that to a few things. First, the city's icy weather makes wearing heels, dresses, and other fashion pieces impractical. Second, the event is rather reserved in nature.\n\n\"For years, this was kind of a boys' club,\" Hunt said. \"Men dressed very conservatively, and I think as women became matriculated into the program, they also kept it conservative. We didn't want to ruffle too many feathers.\"\n\nWith every outfit, though, Hunt is changing that. She said her outfits bring her confidence and energy.\n\n\"In places like this, it's a little bit survival of the fittest, if I'm honest,\" she said. \"Everybody's either eyeing up your affiliation, your look, or what you can do for them. Fashion is the quickest signal that you're either intimidating, interesting, or a whole host of other things.\"",

    "title": "Here's How Netflix Plans to Add TikTok-Style Videos to Its Mobile App",
    "description": "Expect to see clips from \"Stranger Things\" and Pete Davidson's podcast sometime this year.",
    "fullText": "The funny thing about smartphone addiction is that it makes low-effort tasks feel totally productive. When I finally quit doomscrolling through Instagram and TikTok and watch an actual movie or TV show, I feel like I've just spent the afternoon studying physics. Platforms like Netflix, which could once be seen as time-wasting entertainment, now seem like antidotes to endless, useless scrolling.\n\nBut Netflix doesn't seem to appreciate its new role. Instead, the company apparently sees short-form video apps—and smartphones themselves—as a direct threat to its business, and is jumping on the bandwagon. It's not only that Netflix is reportedly now making content with phone scrollers in mind, encouraging creators to craft dialogue that makes their shows and movies easy to understand even if you're not actually paying attention.\n\nNo Netflix also wants to position its mobile app as an actual competitor to TikTok and Instagram, by introducing a short-form video feed directly within the app.\n\nThe company officially introduced its plans for short-form video during its fourth-quarter earnings call on Tuesday. Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters announced the company will roll out a new app later this year that will include its take on the vertical video feed. This isn't totally new, as the company has been experimenting with vertical video feeds since May. But it's the first time we've seen a larger announcement about how Netflix plans to integrate the short-form experience directly into its app.\n\nUnlike TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube, you won't hop on the Netflix app to find short-form videos from independent creators. Instead, Netflix will serve users clips from Netflix-distributed shows and movies in a scrollable TikTok-style feed. You might swipe through this feed and see clips from Stranger Things, Emily in Paris, or His & Hers. Many of us already waste our time watching clips from shows and movies on other platforms—often cropped, slowed down or sped up, in low-quality, and besieged by artifacts meant to throw off copyright claims. Netflix obviously won't need to do this, so I expect the experience will be filled with high-quality videos (depending on how you define \"quality\" of course).\n\nIt won't just be TV shows and movies on the feed. Netflix also has big plans for its video podcasts, as evidenced by recent programs like The Pete Davidson Show and recent deals with Spotify and iHeartMedia to bring existing podcasts to its platform. Expect Netflix to sprinkle clips from these video podcasts into the short-form feed to create an experience that sounds not too far off from scrolling through other apps. How many clips you do see from video podcasts, TV shows, and movies on TikTok?\n\nAs Netflix inches closer to acquiring Warner Bros., you might soon be seeing a lot of official short-form content in the Netflix app. If and when the acquisition closes, I wouldn't be surprised to see clips from HBO shows like A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, The White Lotus, and Euphoria.\n\nI get the move from a business perspective: Netflix is likely losing subscribers' attention due to the addictive nature of vertical video apps. But do any of us really need another app to scroll through, especially when we're already paying for access to the full content to begin with? Maybe could be a helpful avenue to find new shows and movies to watch, but in all likelihood, it will just be be another addictive time-waster. I have too many of those in my life as it is.",

    "fullText": "On top of being a legendary musician and fashion icon, Dolly Parton is also a great chef.\n\nThe country-music star has shared plenty of her cooking secrets with me, including her hack for making the fluffiest scrambled eggs and the unique ingredient she uses to elevate her mac and cheese.\n\nParton also revealed what she loves whipping up in the kitchen for her goddaughter, Miley Cyrus.\n\n\"Miley and I both love Southern food like mashed potatoes, coleslaw, and a big ol' hunk of cornbread — making cornbread muffins or a big pan of it with the squares,\" Parton told me.\n\nI loved trying Parton's Taco Bell order. So when I stumbled on her cornbread recipe, I knew I had to give it a go.\n\nInstead of cooking full bacon strips, I cut the bacon into small pieces and spread them out in my 9-inch skillet so they would render evenly.\n\nI cooked my bacon over medium-low heat until it turned crispy and I could see plenty of drippings at the bottom of the pan. Then, I removed the pieces, letting them rest on a plate lined with a paper towel. Parton said the skillet should be covered with extra bacon drippings, so I didn't wipe it clean after I finished cooking.\n\nYou could easily whip up Parton's recipe after you've made breakfast, or save the bacon to eat alongside her cornbread. Either way, it's a win-win.\n\nFirst, I added two cups of the self-rising cornmeal to a large bowl.\n\nThe first recipe I found online actually called for two tablespoons of bacon drippings instead of two teaspoons. I didn't realize Parton's recipe was different before I made the cornbread again, so I accidentally added extra.\n\nThe flavor still came out great, so feel free to add more bacon drippings if you wish.\n\nParton recommends gradually adding the buttermilk while stirring everything with a wooden spoon. You'll know the batter is ready when it's thick but smooth.\n\nBarely 10 minutes of prep had passed, and my cornbread was ready to go into the oven.\n\nI threw my skillet into the oven at 425 degrees Fahrenheit and let it cook for 25 minutes. Parton says you'll know the cornbread is ready if it springs back when you tap it.",

The three-piece set, in its winter-white shade, featured a delicate floral print.\n\nShe wore the ensemble with ballet flats and chunky black glasses.\n\nIuliia Bazhan, a model and the founder of Evoautism, attended in a full Chanel getup.\n\nShe wore a jacket and miniskirt from the fashion house's Coco Neige collection, a floor-length coat, and white boots with thick chain detailing.\n\nOne attendee, photographed by Business Insider, accessorized his navy jacket with a multicolored scarf, sunglasses with orange-tinted lenses, and blue leather gloves.\n\nHe also wore a thick gold ring and a giant watch.\n\nOne woman was seen in Davos wearing a bright-pink suit with a white mock-neck top. On its own, the outfit was chic and feminine — especially when paired with her Louis Vuitton tote bag.\n\nHowever, she didn't accessorize with heels or jewelry. Instead, she wore tan snow boots and brown leather gloves.\n\nOf course, they're doing so fashionably. One person wore dark-wash jeans with white socks, red sneakers, and a puffy coat that combined both colors with others across its statement print.\n\nThey also wore a thick red scarf and a lilac beanie.\n\nSarah Backhouse, an executive director at executive networking company World Fifty Group, matched the fur collar of her Frankie Shop coat with a cozy fur hat.\n\nShe accessorized the ensemble with Saint Laurent sunglasses and a Maison Goyard bag.\n\nWealth manager Andrew Gan gave his suit a Davos upgrade with a fur-lined coat and sunglasses as he headed to the Philippines House to moderate.\n\nNidhi Sinja, the head of marketing and communications for BCG North America, opted to carry a notebook in her quilted weatherproof Tory Burch bag.\n\nShe coordinated the look with a North Face coat and L.L. Bean boots, both in cream hues that matched her white purse.\n\nWendy Diamond is the founder and CEO of Women's Entrepreneurship Day Organization. She's also an investor and board advisor for numerous companies.\n\nShe wore a green satin suit, a statement charm necklace, and thick black boots. She told Business Insider that green is her \"happy color,\" and that she likes to wear bright colors when \"the world is so dark.\"\n\nWhen the CEO of Philip Morris International US travels, even for long trips, she takes a carry-on. Her trick: Pick a color for the week and coordinate outfits around that, with travel-well fabrics. For Davos this week, the color is black.\n\nJonathan Nowak Delgado, a senior advisor at nonprofit ViaTalenta Foundation, per his business card, has a strategy to stand out at Davos: wear a mix of bold colors.\n\nHis outfit included a statement orange scarf, which his mother made for him.\n\nOne attendee photographed by Business Insider was seen wearing a tweed suit beneath a gray fuzzy coat and a thin, floral scarf.\n\nIn addition to the fabric layers, she wore black platform boots, white sunglasses, Chanel earrings, and a pink Prada handbag.\n\nJolie Hunt, the CEO of communications agency Hunt & Gather, has worn some of the event's most statement-making looks.\n\nOn Monday, she donned a printed minidress from Balmain with sheer tights, paired it with Larroudé x Libertine pumps adorned with lips, and carried an Hermès Birkin bag.",

    "title": "I flew to Bali for a surf camp. A conversation I had there about failure inspired me to launch a small business.",
    "description": "Gina Jaguttis shared how two solo trips to Bali led her to start her slow fashion business as a side hustle.",
    "fullText": "On a Monday morning in early December, I met Gina Jaguttis as we loaded our surfboards into the camp van just before sunrise. We only got to talking on a choppy boat ride that took us a mile off the coast of Bali, Indonesia.\n\nThe 26-year-old real estate project manager from Munich came to the surf camp to improve her skills on the water. I came to talk with adventurous travelers about their big ideas, from new businesses to life after layoffs.\n\nAt our camp's bonfire that night, she began to tell me why she made a second solo expedition to the tropical island. As we toasted marshmallows, she shared that she had launched a small side hustle a day before the bonfire.\n\nA few weeks after we got home, both recovering from sunburns and surf injuries, we unpacked her story further in a call. Our chats have been edited for length and clarity; the following is in Jaguttis' words.\n\nWhen I started my career a few years ago, I struggled to find formal clothes that looked professional and were good quality. Brands like Zara or Mango didn't meet my longevity standards, and I didn't love how they are mass-produced. Construction and real estate are male-dominated, and I always wanted to look well-dressed so others know that they have to treat me professionally.\n\nIn college, I was the girl who had a capsule wardrobe with pieces such as turtlenecks and cotton pants that I knew looked stylish then but also 10 years later. When I started work, it was frustrating to find well-fitted suits or blouses that were timeless and would last several years. On a trip to Bali and Thailand in 2024, I decided to invest in workwear and got a few pieces custom-made at a tailor's shop. I created vision boards, selected high-quality fabrics, and had some classic pieces made. I finally felt like I had outfits that made me feel confident in front of manager and director-level people.\n\nOnce I started wearing these suits back home, people asked me where I bought them from and were surprised to hear that I designed them myself. One woman said that if I ever turned it into a business, she would definitely be up for buying from me.\n\nWhen I heard this for a second time, I started thinking about building my own brand.\n\nStarting a business, especially one that I would fund entirely with my own savings, is always a daunting prospect. The biggest thought holding me back was \"Am I going to fail?\"\n\nIn late November 2025, about a year after my first trip, I went to Bali again, this time to learn how to surf. I stayed at a surf camp and was surrounded by inspiring people from all over the world.\n\nIt was a reflective retreat for most of them, and many were there to figure out what they wanted out of life. I met people who took all kinds of risks: musicians who stuck to their passion even when they struggled to find a job, people in between career changes, or someone living out of a van while she figured out her life plan.\n\nTalking to them made me realize that I actually knew what I wanted, and it made me think about what was really holding me back. They told me that if I fail, it would be a good story.\n\nI launched my company's Instagram that day.\n\nIt's been a few weeks since I was at the surf camp and launched my business. I'm still working full time and plan to for a while, which means balancing the business before and after work.\n\nI spend one and a half hours in the morning on the business on most days, and time on the weekends and on vacation. I'm not in a rush since I have a steady job. My priority is going slow, making it work, and getting these outfits to women who would admire my slow fashion, anti-spontaneous shopping mission. I don't want to be just another fashion brand.\n\nThe first stage of production will require between 5,000 to 10,000 euros in investment from my savings.\n\nMy other big expense is time, since I have to do everything, including branding, marketing, and designing, by myself — for now.",

    "fullText": "Italian fashion designer Valentino Garavani, known as Valentino, has died at 93, his foundation announced in an Instagram post on Monday.\n\n\"Our founder, Valentino Garavani passed away today at his Roman residence, surrounded by his loved ones,\" the caption read.\n\nValentino founded his eponymous fashion house in 1960 and quickly became one of fashion's defining figures.

The man who was in love with beauty, his family, his muses, his friends. His dogs, his gardens, and a good Hollywood story. I loved him so much. I loved how he always pestered me to 'at least wear a little mascara' when I came to dinner. I loved his naughty laugh,\" Paltrow wrote in the caption.\n\n\"This feels like the end of an era. He will be deeply missed by me and all who loved him.

He is what true legends are made of, living on forever through the brand he created, the embodiment of timeless elegance and glamour. I loved the special times where I got to bring his creations to life on and off the runway. One of my favourite campaigns was in Rome where I became Anita Ekberg in La Dolce Vita, a memory I will cherish forever,\" Schiffer wrote in her caption.\n\n\"I will remember the fun holidays I spent with him in Mallorca, Ibiza and St Tropez. My Valentino wedding gown which I have framed at home as a constant reminder of his gentle, generous, sweet and loyal nature.

    "fullText": "The Michael Carrick era began in glorious fashion, as Manchester United overpowered noisy neighbours Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday.\n\nWhat the new caretaker head coach got spot on was his tactics and his utilisation of the squad. For far too long under Ruben Amorim, round pegs have been shoved into square holes.\n\nBut not the legendary midfielder. He played players in their natural positions, as seen from Bruno Fernandes occupying the No.10 position behind the striker and playing a free role like he used to under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\n\nThe Portuguese was at the centre of everything good, and also picked up an assist for the first goal scored by Bryan Mbeumo.\n\nDespite the stunning return to form, the club captain is reportedly open to leaving in the summer, having grown disillusioned with the owners and the project.\n\nINEOS were said to be open to his departure last summer as well, and there is plenty of interest from both within Europe and the Saudi Pro League.\n\nBut if the Portugal international leaves, the Red Devils will need an incredible signing to offset the loss. And as per SportsBoom, the Red Devils feel Morgan Gibbs-White would be the perfect attacking signing.\n\nThe 20-time English league champions were even ready to invest in January, but given Nottingham Forest’s precarious league form, they will not sell their talisman this month.\n\nBut they are fully aware that United will return in the summer, and they will find competition in the form of Chelsea.\n\nForest are likely to demand a staggering €80-85 million for the England international, whether they receive such a high fee remains to be seen.\n\n25/26 season stats via Transfermarkt\n\n“Nottingham Forest are standing firm over the future of their star midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White. The club hierarchy has made it clear that the player is not for sale in the January transfer window, despite persistent interest from Premier League giants Manchester United and Chelsea.\n\n“However, fresh updates from sources close to the situation suggest that Manchester United and Chelsea have been tracking the playmaker for a long time. Both clubs are expected to renew their efforts in the summer window.\n\n“Manchester United are reportedly in the market for a creative spark in the final third, while Chelsea’s strategy of building a young, dynamic squad keeps Morgan Gibbs-White high on their shortlist.\n\n“From a financial perspective, if a move eventually materialises, the valuation is expected to reach a staggering €80-85 million.”\n\nThe 25-year-old already has six goals and three assists to his name despite Forest’s struggles, while last season, he registered seven goals and 10 assists.\n\nMorgan Gibbs-White could prove an astute signing, but not for the price being quoted. He is not the only Forest player on the club’s radar with INEOS likely to go after Elliot Anderson to solve their midfield woes.\n\nFeature image Clive Brunskill via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "As Lexi Thompson steps away from the LPGA spotlight, the golf star is embracing a new chapter in her personal life. Turning heads off the course, Thompson recently celebrated her bachelorette party in style, offering fans a glimpse into her wedding preparations. The joyful milestone arrives amid her competitive hiatus, marking a moment of balance between career reflection and personal celebration as she prepares for the next phase of her life.\n\nLexi Thompson took to Instagram to share some moments from her bachelorette party.\n\n“So much fun at @moxiesusa for bachelorette celebrations,” captioned Thompson below a series of pictures from her bachelorette.\n\nThe LPGA Tour pro celebrated with her friends at the Moxies restaurant. Thompson is set to marry Max Provost in March 2026.\n\nBack in early 2025, the 30-year-old announced her engagement to Provost. According to the reports, Provost asked the all-important question to Thompson on New Year’s Day 2025, in Whistler, Canada. And much to his elation, the 1x major champion gave the nod, agreeing to be tied with Provost for life. While Max Provost is keeping his life very private, from his LinkedIn profile, we can see that he is a Clinical Sales Representative for Intuitive Surgical.\n\n“I work with physicians and surgeons to help with the adoption of daVinci robotics in surgery. I help enhance the lives of patients by offering and educating on a state-of-the-art minimally invasive surgical modality that leads to faster recovery, less complications, and a better overall quality of life,” his bio reads.\n\nAs of now, Thompson is semi-retired. Following her participation in the 2024 U.S. Women’s Open, Thompson declared that she will no longer participate in a full LPGA season from now on.\n\nThompson turned pro at just 15 years of age. She has, till now, clinched 15 professional titles, out of which 11 of her victories came in the LPGA Tour. Thus, when she announced a semi-retirement from her career, although fans were shocked, according to Thompson, the decision was exactly what she needed.\n\n“I want to have a family one day and just enjoy every experience of that and be there for every single moment. That’s the most important for me. I’ve only known golf as my life. So it’s nice to branch out and be able to enjoy other things,” she said in a statement after she announced her retirement in 2024.\n\nWith Thompson trying to soak in the essence of life, fans soon had their voices heard online.\n\nIn the Instagram post, Thompson shared how she has spent quality time with her friends. Witnessing the lavish celebration, one fan noted, “Well, that looks like fun, and you look gorgeous and so happy\n\n.” Another fan, too, echoed the same thoughts and wrote, “Looks like fun! Congratulations & enjoy the moment\n\nWith just weeks left for the D-Day to arrive, good wishes have already started pouring in for the LPGA golfer. One such comment read, “SOO Many congratulations\n\nLexi. Wonderful to see you happy\n\n”. Another fan chimed in, “Congratulations, Lexi.”\n\nAs Thompson had taken a break from the competitive realm by taking a semi-retirement, and fans would not be getting to see the star play in all the calendar events, one golf enthusiast mentioned, “Going to miss seeing you on the course this season.”\n\nThus, with things looking rosy for the 30-year-old, fans cannot wait to see her enjoy life to the fullest post her marriage.\n\nThe post Lexi Thompson Turns Heads at Her Bachelorette Party as Wedding Preps Begin Amid LPGA Hiatus appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

In the aftermath of the killing, Aminian's mother had to look through piles of bloodied corpses to find her daughter's body.  More than a week after she was killed, Aminian's relatives say they still have not held a funeral for the young Kurdish woman who was studying fashion in Tehran, the capital.",
    "fullText": "BEIRUT (AP) — Robina Aminian's family believes the college student was killed by a bullet fired by Iranian security forces straight into the back of her head.\n\nBut her death in the nationwide protests that challenged the Islamic Republic's theocracy was only the start of the family's agony. In the aftermath of the killing, Aminian's mother had to look through piles of bloodied corpses to find her daughter's body. Then the family raced to escape authorities who might demand payment to release the body and buried her hastily in an unmarked roadside pit.\n\nTheir odyssey reflects the trail of anguish left by Iran's deadly assault on protesters, which has led to desperate relatives searching overflowing morgues across the country. For families, the loss of loved ones is compounded by the difficulty they face in grieving and giving the dead a dignified sendoff.\n\nMore than a week after she was killed, Aminian's relatives say they still have not held a funeral for the young Kurdish woman who was studying fashion in Tehran, the capital.\n\n“She wanted a bright future for herself,” her uncle, Nezar Minoei, said from Oslo. “But unfortunately, the future has been stolen from her.”\n\nDetails about what happened to Aminian are scant. After her death, her mother called relatives outside the country, recounting what she learned from Aminian's friends, who were present when she was killed.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke to three relatives, who all described similar details from the mother's account. An Oslo-based human rights organization, Iran Human Rights, released a report about her killing, citing witness testimony. They verified there was a shooting on the night of Jan. 8 around the campus of the Shariati Technical and Vocational College for Girls.\n\nWith communications greatly limited in Iran, the AP has been unable to independently confirm the family’s account or the wounds to Aminian’s body or to verify its location. The Iranian mission to the United Nations in New York has declined to comment.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which relies on a network of activists on the ground and has been accurate during previous unrest in Iran, said at least 3,090 people have been killed. Iran's government has not offered any overall casualties figures.\n\nEverything that Aminian's relatives abroad know about her death comes from a brief phone call her mother was able to make Jan. 10 to relatives in Oslo.\n\nThey say the mother, Amina Norei, got a call Jan. 8 from Aminian’s friends, who said she had been gunned down by security forces. The friends told Norei they were walking away from campus in Tehran after dark when they saw a protest and joined in.\n\nA bullet fired by security forces struck the back of Aminian’s head, her friends told the mother.\n\nVideos shared on social media, verified by the AP, and statements by rights groups, doctors and survivors, describe Iranian agents using rifles and shotguns to disperse protesters across the country.\n\nIran's theocracy, which has used violence in previous rounds of unrest, increasingly refers to demonstrators as “terrorists.\" Authorities allege some demonstrators were armed, but there are no allegations that anyone was armed in Aminian's vicinity at the time of her death.\n\nAminian’s relatives said she was not an activist or involved in politics.\n\nAminian's mother was in Kermanshah, a western city in the Kurdish region of Iran nearly 460 kilometers (230 miles) from Tehran, when she learned about her daughter's death.\n\nShe rushed to Tehran in the middle of the night, she told family. Norei recalled to them how she began unzipping body bag after body bag, looking for Aminian.\n\n“She looked through so many beautiful faces, trying to find her girl,\" Hali Norei, Amnian's aunt, said from Oslo. ”And what is so horrifying for me is imagining what my sister feels as she searches for her daughter.\"\n\nMany other Iranian families are searching overflowing morgues for loved ones, according to rights group Amnesty International. Bodies have piled up in trucks, freight containers and warehouses, the group said.\n\nWhen Norei found her daughter, she was joined by her husband, daughter and son, and the family rushed out with the body, fearing authorities would block their way and insist on a payment to release the corpse, according to Minoei, Aminian’s uncle.\n\n“She actually stole the body,” Minoei said.\n\nIn a statement to the AP, the New York City-based Center for Human Rights in Iran said it has received multiple accounts of intelligence forces demanding money from families in exchange for the return of protesters' bodies. The group called the levies “a well-known, standard practice” in Iran to scare families into not publicly mourning their dead.\n\nOther families reported to the center that they were forced to sign papers falsely declaring that their dead relatives were members of the security forces in order to retrieve the bodies.\n\nIranian state television recently aired a statement saying mortuary and burial services were free, after repeated allegations of the practice.\n\nMinoei said the mother told him that she and her oldest daughter spent the seven-hour ride back to Kermanshah clutching the body in the backseat, blood and tears staining their clothes. When they got home, the mother told him, security forces had surrounded their house.\n\nAmina Norei told her family they had only one option: They drove out of town and dug a pit on the side of the road. They placed the body inside and drove away. Aminian is still believed to be buried there, in an unmarked grave.\n\nRelatives said they have not heard from Amina Norei or other relatives in Iran since Sunday.\n\nJulia Frankel reported from Jerusalem.",

    "description": "I chose open, honest conversations with my kids about sex, drugs, and mistakes, even when others judged my parenting style.",
    "fullText": "Growing up, the grandparents who raised me were a generation removed from me, and because of it, I never felt like I could go to them with real issues or problems.\n\nI hid the deep and dark stuff because children were to be seen and not heard. We did not talk about the big things like sex or drugs. Instead, the warnings were direct and often frightening. They went something like this, \"Do not do drugs or you'll die.\" The pregnancy mantra was similar: \"Do not have sex or you'll get pregnant.\"\n\nAlongside the lack of communication was a heavy dose of fear and threats. I suppose their own parents passed down less-than-stellar communication skills and used threats in an effort to protect.\n\nI remember coming home after having a few drinks at a high school party. \"You can do this one step at a time. Say hello and walk (in a straight line) to your room,\" I whispered to myself as I climbed the steep front steps leading to our second-floor apartment. There was no getting caught, or I would die, or at least endure endless punishments preventing me from going to said parties until I was an adult capable of making my own decisions.\n\nNot only did I not know how to talk to my grandparents, but I was also terrified of them.\n\nSometimes, this lack of communication led to unwise decisions. I didn't feel like I had an adult I could call if I'd done something I wasn't supposed to do. If I did something foolish, I was on my own. It wasn't safe, and I'd watched more than one friend get seriously injured (either physically or mentally) when they made a typical teen choice and felt they didn't have an adult they could trust to help them.\n\nWith my own kids, I wanted to keep the lines of communication open, which became especially important as my children navigated middle school and high school. These years of adolescence included poor decision-making and a desperate struggle between being a kid and trying to grow up.\n\nI talked openly with them about drugs, sex, and drinking. No subject was off limits. They knew they could tell me anything. Keeping our communication open and honest showed them a level of trust that other parents found difficult to understand. I often had my kids' friends telling me things they couldn't say to their parents. I tried to listen without judgment. I knew it was a fine line between discipline and acceptance. I also knew no matter what, keeping my kids safe was my first and most important job as a parent.\n\nAs my second set of kids head into the muddy waters of middle school and high school, these discussions are again at the forefront. \"If you drink, I'll be more upset if you get in a car with someone who's been drinking or if you decide to drive than I will because of the drinking,\" I recently told my high school daughter. Realistically, while I don't openly condone underage drinking, I know it is, more often than not, a part of the teen years. \"Call me,\" I said, \"and I'll come get you.\n\nWhile there were many things I did not accept, I also did my best to remain open-minded. It was sometimes difficult to parent this way. My kids did and continue to do things I often don't agree with. I looked at these as teaching opportunities, rather than seeing them as moments to punish. Viewing things this way has helped me foster and maintain very close relationships with my kids. It is something others have commented on, including a social worker I visited with my son. \"No matter what is going on,\" she said, \"you two seem to have a really tight and open relationship.\" It remains one of the best compliments I've received as a parent.\n\nThere was another side to those comments, though. Parenthood is often filled with judgment and criticism. When my son dropped out of school, and my teens struggled with typical teen things like drinking, drug use, and sex, I remember hearing a neighbor refer to me as a loosey goosey parent. The neighbor in question didn't understand my relationship with my kids. They didn't share my parenting philosophy. Really, they didn't have to. While the comment initially bothered me, I knew I was parenting in the only way I could. I parented in a way that I wasn't parented, but wished that I had been.\n\nAs my two oldest kids hit adulthood and my youngest two become teenagers, I'm not sorry for being loosey goosey. I would do it the same way all over again. In fact, I am. I have no regrets. I hope the neighbor who judged me feels the same way when their kids go through the tough teen years.",

    "fullText": "Back in 1993, Shoshanna Lonstein Gruss, then just Shoshanna Lonstein, became a tabloid darling because she dated Jerry Seinfeld at the height of his sitcom fame.\n\nThat was before you could be social media famous, but essentially, she was one of the first influencers, and she parlayed the fame of her four-year relationship into a successful career as a fashion designer.\n\nLonstein Gruss was a rare person, back in those days, who managed to turn fame by association into a real career. Her Shoshanna clothing brand was respected and enduring, not an attempt to capitalize on her name recognition, as happened with Monica Lewinsky's handbag line, or in a more recent example, Mike \"The Situation\" Sorrentino's \"Situation Nation” clothing line.\n\nShoshanna operates its own store, while also being sold at retailers including Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, and Bloomingdale's. It also has some items for sale on Amazon.\n\nNow the retail brand has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, on the same day that Saks Global and Neiman Marcus also filed. (It's important to note that the company behind the Shoshanna brand uses a slightly different spelling — i.e., Shoshanah Fashions.)\n\nLonstein Gruss may have started as a tabloid figure, but she has a deep history as a respected fashion designer.\n\n\"After 27 years of dedication and innovation, the Shoshanna collection has developed a legion of fans, including Mindy Kaling, Isla Fisher, Kelly Ripa, and The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle. The collection can be found in luxury retailers like Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdale's, ShopBop, and Anthropologie as well as over 500 specialty stores in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia,\" the company shared on its website.\n\nShoshanah Fashions has not made a public statement about its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The filing, however, came on the same day Saks Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nSaks Global's Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus are key distribution partners for Shoshanna Fashions, and the brand is almost certainly owed money by its partner, according to data shared with TheStreet by Ragini Bhalla, Head of Brand and Spokesperson for Creditsafe.\n\n\"Saks Inc. had a persistent and troubling pattern of paying vendors late in 2025,\npointing to sustained liquidity problems. Days Beyond Terms (DBT) refers to the\nnumber of days late (i.e., past payment terms) that a company pays its bills. One of the\nmost common indications that a company is struggling with cash flow is when its DBT is\nsignificantly higher than other companies in the same industry,\" the research showed.",

It’s gonna be very difficult to get back there, but I’m happy to put myself in the game again.”\n\nOne of the main reasons Sinner ended the season as the world number two, was because of his three-month ban at the start of the year.\n\nSinner was forced to miss several high-profile hard court tournaments after winning the 2025 Australian Open, which dented his ranking.\n\nWith no points to defend for three months, it is very likely that Sinner will dislodge Alcaraz at the top of the rankings.\n\nSinner has been drawn against Hugo Gaston in the first round of the Australian Open as he looks to continue his 12-match unbeaten streak in Melbourne.\n\nThe two men have only played each other twice on the ATP Tour, and both of those matches came back in 2021.\n\nThe world number two won both against his French counterpart, dropping just nine games in the two matches.\n\nSinner has been drawn in the same section of the draw as Joao Fonseca, Karen Khachanov, and Sebastian Baez.",

    "fullText": "Progress of artificial general intelligence could stall, which may lead to a financial crash, says Yoshua Bengio, one of the ‘godfathers’ of modern AI\n\nWill the race to artificial general intelligence (AGI) lead us to a land of financial plenty – or will it end in a 2008-style bust? Trillions of dollars rest on the answer.\n\nThe figures are staggering: an estimated $2.9tn (£2.2tn) being spent on datacentres, the central nervous systems of AI tools; the more than $4tn stock market capitalisation of Nvidia, the company that makes the chips powering cutting-edge AI systems; and the $100m signing-on bonuses offered by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta to top engineers at OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.\n\nThese sky-high numbers are all propped up by investors who expect a return on their trillions. AGI, a theoretical state of AI where systems gain human levels of intelligence across an array of tasks and are able to replace humans in white-collar jobs such as accountancy and law, is a keystone of this financial promise.\n\nIt offers the prospect of computer systems carrying out profitable work without the associated cost of human labour – a hugely lucrative scenario for companies developing the technology and the customers who deploy it.\n\nThere will be consequences if AI companies fall short: US stock markets, boosted heavily by the performance of tech stocks, could fall and cause damage to people’s personal wealth; debt markets wrapped up in the datacentre boom could suffer a jolt that ripples elsewhere; GDP growth in the US, which has benefited from the AI infrastructure, could falter, which would have knock-on effects for interlinked economies.\n\nDavid Cahn, a partner at one leading Silicon Valley investment firm, Sequoia Capital, says tech companies now have to deliver on AGI.\n\n“Nothing short of AGI will be enough to justify the investments now being proposed for the coming decade,” he wrote in a blog published in October.\n\nIt means there is a lot hanging on progress towards advanced AI, and the trillions being poured into infrastructure and R&D to achieve it. One of the “godfathers” of modern AI, Yoshua Bengio, says the progress of AGI could stall and the outcome would be bad for investors.\n\n“There is a clear possibility that we will hit a wall, that there’s some difficulty that we don’t foresee right now, and we don’t find any solution quickly,” he says. “And that could be a real [financial] crash. A lot of the people who are putting trillions right now into AI are also expecting the advances to continue fairly regularly at the current pace.”\n\nBut Bengio, a prominent voice on the safety implications of AGI, is clear that continued progress towards a highly advanced state of AI is the more likely endgame.\n\n“Advances stalling is a minority scenario, like it’s an unlikely scenario. The more likely scenario is we continue to move forward,” he says.\n\nThe pessimistic view is that investors are backing an unrealistic outcome – that AGI will not happen without further breakthroughs.\n\nDavid Bader, the director of the institute for data science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, says trillions of dollars are being spent on scaling up – tech jargon for growing something quickly – the underlying technology for chatbots, known as transformers, in the expectation that increasing the amount of computing power behind current AI systems, by building more datacentres, will suffice.\n\n“If AGI requires a fundamentally different approach, perhaps something we haven’t yet conceived, then we’re optimising an architecture that can’t get us there no matter how large we make it. It’s like trying to reach the moon by building taller ladders,” he says.\n\nNonetheless, big US tech companies such as Google’s parent Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft are ploughing ahead with datacentre plans with the financial cushion of being able to fund their AGI ambitions through the cash generated by their hugely profitable day-to-day businesses. This at least gives them some protection if the wall outlined by Bengio and Bader comes into view.\n\nBut there are other more worrying aspects to the boom. Analysts at Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, estimate that $2.9tn will be spent on datacentres between now and 2028, with half of that covered by the cashflow from “hyperscalers” such as Alphabet and Microsoft.\n\nThe rest will have to be covered by alternative sources such as private credit, a corner of the shadow banking sector that is activating alarm bells at the Bank of England and elsewhere. Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, has borrowed $29bn from the private credit market to finance a datacentre in Louisiana.\n\nAI-related sectors account for approximately 15% of investment grade debt in the US, which is even bigger than the banking sector, according to the investment bank JP Morgan.\n\nOracle, which has signed a $300bn datacentre deal with OpenAI, has had an increase in credit default swaps, which are a form of insurance on a company defaulting on its debts. High-yield, or “junk debt”, which represents the higher-risk end of the borrowing market, is also appearing in the AI sector via datacentre operators CoreWeave and TeraWulf. Growth is also being funded by asset-backed securities – a form of debt underpinned by assets such as loans or credit card debt, but in this case rent paid by tech companies to datacentre owners – in a form of financing that has risen sharply in recent years.\n\nIt is no wonder that JP Morgan says the AI infrastructure boom will require a contribution from all corners of the credit market.\n\nBader says: “If AGI doesn’t materialise on expected timelines, we could see contagion across multiple debt markets simultaneously – investment-grade bonds, high-yield junk debt, private credit and securitised products – all of which are being tapped to fund this buildout.”\n\nShare prices linked to AI and tech are also playing an outsized role in US stock markets. The so-called “magnificent 7” of US tech stocks – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia – account for more than a third of the value of the S&P 500 index, the biggest stock market index in the US, compared with 20% at the start of the decade.\n\nIn October the Bank of England warned of “the risk of a sharp correction” in US and UK markets due to giddy valuations of AI-linked tech companies. Central bankers are concerned stock markets could slump if AI fails to reach the transformative heights investors are hoping for. At the same time the International Monetary Fund said valuations were heading towards dotcom bubble-levels.\n\nEven tech execs whose companies are benefiting from the boom are acknowledging the speculative nature of the frenzy. In November Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Alphabet, said there are “elements of irrationality” in the boom and that “no company is going to be immune” if the bubble bursts, while Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, has said the AI industry is in a “kind of industrial bubble”, and OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, has said “there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now.”\n\nAll three, to be clear, are AI optimists and expect the technology to keep improving and benefit society.\n\nBut when the numbers get this big there are obvious risks in a bubble bursting, as Pichai admits. Pension funds and anyone invested in the stock market will be affected by a share price collapse, while the debt markets will also take a hit. There is also a web of “circular” deals, such as OpenAI paying Nvidia in cash for chips, and Nvidia will invest in OpenAI for non-controlling shares. If these transactions unravel due to a lack of take-up of AI, or that wall being hit, then it could be messy.\n\nThere are also optimists who argue that generative AI, the catch-all term for tools such as chatbots and video generators, will transform whole industries and justify the expenditure. Benedict Evans, a technology analyst, says the expenditure numbers are not outrageous in the context of other industries, such as oil and gas extraction which runs at $600bn a year.\n\n“These AI capex figures are a lot of money but it’s not an impossible amount of money,” he says.\n\nEvans adds: “You don’t have to believe in AGI to believe that generative AI is a big thing. And most of what is happening here is not, ‘oh wow they’re going to create God’. It’s ‘this is going to completely change how advertising, search, software and social networks – and everything else our business is based on – is going to work’. It’s going to be a huge opportunity.”\n\nNonetheless, there is a multitrillion dollar expectation that AGI will be achieved. For many experts, the consequences of getting there are alarming. The cost of not getting there could also be significant.",

    "fullText": "As we hit the heart of the college basketball season, I’ll be bringing you a moneyline parlay every Saturday for what’s always a stacked slate of NCAA hoops action.\n\nToday, I’m backing undefeated Nebraska, an SMU squad that remains perfect at home, and Arkansas on the road.\n\nBest of all, this parlay has been BOOSTED by our friends at bet365! Here are my college basketball picks for January 17!\n\nTime: 4:00 p.m. ET\nLocation: Evanston, IL\nTV: Big Ten Network\nPick: Nebraska (-245)\n\nThe 17-0 Nebraska Cornhuskers are one of just three unbeaten teams left in college hoops. The Huskers have beaten quality competition, owning five wins over Top-40 KenPom teams — including victories against No. 12 Michigan State and No. 5 Illinois.\n\nThey won’t go undefeated forever, but a Northwestern Wildcats team that has lost eight straight games against high-major opponents isn’t likely to be the one to trip them up.\n\nTime: 12:00 p.m. ET\nLocation: Dallas, TX\nTV: ESPN2\nPick: SMU (+120)\n\nThis sets up as a potential letdown and lookahead spot for the Virginia Cavaliers, who are coming off a big road win at Louisville and have a week off after this game. The Hoos rely heavily on the 3-point shot, which doesn’t always travel well.\n\nMeanwhile, the SMU Mustangs are a perfect 11-0 at home, most recently beating Virginia Tech on a last-second half-court shot Wednesday. SMU boasts elite guard play and held its own on the road at Duke last week despite missing star guard Boopie Miller (20.8 ppg, 7.1 apg).\n\nBack at home with Miller in the lineup, the Mustangs should be in a strong position to get the job done against UVA.\n\nTime: 4:00 p.m. ET\nLocation: Athens, GA\nTV: ESPN2\nPick: Arkansas (+105)\n\nThe No. 21-ranked Georgia Bulldogs have been an offensive juggernaut, leading the nation at 96.4 points per game. That said, I’m not sold on Georgia’s resume, as the Bulldogs rank 116th in strength of schedule and are 0-2 in Quad 1 games.\n\nMeanwhile, the No. 17 Arkansas Razorbacks have faced the 27th-toughest schedule and are 3-4 in Quad 1 contests. Arkansas also boasts the more talented roster and the coaching edge with John Calipari on the sideline.\n\nThat’s enough for me to back the Razorbacks as short road dogs.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "description": "Writing at the end of the world, from Hveragerði, Iceland",
    "fullText": "It’s now been roughly six months since I slowed down this newsletter to give me space to think and reconsider.\n\nI’ve done this before – several times in the history of this website, in fact. Sometimes the blog has stayed sporadic for a couple of years. Sometimes only a few weeks passed until I found my motivation again.\n\nWriting just for yourself is its own kind of fun. Whatever else is going on in my life, even when the mental landscape that is my blog or newsletter is lying fallow and slowly regaining its fertility, I still update it occasionally because writing is both fun and a tool that helps me make sense of the world around me.\n\nBut writing – any media – only reaches its full potential if it’s done with an audience – not just for an audience, but written as a part of the field or community in discourse with others.\n\nAnd that kind of writing has to have a purpose. It needs to be of service and add value to the field that frames it.\n\nThat’s the bargain. That’s why people read what you write and, occasionally, help support the writer in some way.\n\nWhen you feel that you’re burning out on writing, one of the possible reasons is that the bargain that’s specific to the writing you’ve been doing isn’t working for you.\n\nWhen an audience wants anger and hostility, feeding that can be the writing bargain you offer and the audience will often reward you with attention, praise, and waves of hostility that lift you up, as if it were support, because the poison is directed elsewhere.\n\nBut the poison is still there. Feeding hostility in others requires feeding the hostility in yourself.\n\nThis is why I’ve been struggling for a while now to write constructively about tech and “AI” specifically. Constructive criticism has a purpose, but we’re at a point in the current iteration of “irrational exuberance” where the stakes for the pro- side are so high that nothing constructive registers and what we’re left with are anger and the expert chroniclers of “just how bad is it anyway?”\n\nAcademics and researchers who specialise in machine learning and related fields catalogue the hype and promises. The few genuinely numerate journalists, such as Ed Zitron, do the maths on just how big and potentially catastrophic the bubble is. We’re at a point where the finances, environmental impact (which is currently expressing itself mostly on a community level), workplace dysfunction, and outright debasement of the entire software industry’s user experience mean that there is simply no reasonable justification for supporting these tools. They are obviously destructive.\n\nSensible criticism is unnecessary in this environment. You need chroniclers – the experts who are cataloguing the various examples that show just how damaging these systems are – and you need the analysts – the journalists who can tell us just how many orders of magnitude the industry numbers are off by – but there is little outright need for low-key constructive criticism.\n\nBecause the correct response to those who are explicitly collaborating with authoritarians and fascists, as much of the “AI” industry is doing, isn’t to tell them that their tech is likely to cause substantial delays at the organisations that adopt it.\n\nThe correct response is to tell them to fuck off and then move on.\n\nWallowing in the anger isn’t productive. Mockery always works, but I’ve never been much of a humour writer so I already know that I should be leaving that kind of writing to others.\n\nSo I had to do a bit of contemplation. I’m not a particularly fast thinker. I tend to linger on details for too long and overthink things, but with enough time I get there and I think it’s time to put this newsletter back on a schedule. I’m putting together something that wraps up my coverage of “AI” specifically, at least for now, but other than that I’d like to continue my explorations of the impact of and problems caused by tech, but with a slight shift in focus:\n\nSoftware as a mass medium and the effect it has on other media.\n\nThe reason is straightforward: pretending software isn’t a medium, pretending that it doesn’t have \n\nIt doesn’t work for those of us who have been making software.\n\nIt doesn’t work for those of us who need to use the software.\n\nIt doesn’t work for the societies that have, inadvisedly, come to depend on what’s effectively a bunch of flared jeans designers cosplaying as engineers as the fundamental drivers of their economies.\n\nPretending this made-up bullshit makes sense doesn’t work any more. At least, it doesn’t work any more for those of us who have avoided getting caught up in the bubble irrationality.\n\nThe best way to deal with software – making it, using it, dealing with it as a creative medium, coping with it as a maker of other creative media – is to understand it as it really is:\n\nA creative medium driven by fashion that operates with limited regard for practicality or productivity.\n\nThis isn’t far off from what I was already doing. Systems-thinking is still one of the lenses I apply and I’m firmly of the school of media analysis that takes business factors and processes into account, so it’s mostly a question of broadening the focus slightly, coupled with a small change in perspective.\n\nMaybe it won’t work and I’ll have to rethink things again, which is fine. Maybe it’ll only work for a few weeks until the topic runs out of steam, which is also fine.\n\nBut at least it should be a bit fun.\n\nI’ve finally released print versions of all my books:\n\nIf you’d like to support this newsletter and make it likelier that I continue to publish in print in the future, this would be the time to order a copy. 🙂",

    "fullText": "Move comes as calls for Australia-style social media ban for under-16s grow around world\n\nTikTok will begin to roll out new age-verification technology across the EU in the coming weeks, as calls grow for an Australia-style social media ban for under-16s in countries including the UK.\n\nByteDance-owned TikTok, and other major platforms popular with young people such as YouTube, are coming under increasing pressure to better identify and remove accounts belonging to children.\n\nThe system, which has been quietly piloted in the EU over the past year, analyses profile information, posted videos and behavioural signals to predict whether an account may be belong to a user under the age of 13.\n\nAs well as analysing information the account holder provides about themselves, the technology looks at behaviour such as the videos a user publishes, and “other on-platform behaviour”.\n\nTikTok said accounts flagged by the system would be reviewed by specialist moderators rather than face an automatic ban, and may then be removed.\n\nIt also said users would have an opportunity to appeal against the removal of an account if an error had been made.\n\nOptions for age identification offered by TikTok during the appeal process include facial age estimation by the verification company Yoti, credit card authorisation or government-approved identification.\n\nThe European pilot led to the removal of thousands of accounts.\n\nThe rollout of the system comes as European authorities scrutinise how platforms verify users’ ages under data protection rules.\n\nTikTok said its system complied with data and privacy laws. “The prediction of the likelihood that someone is under the age of 13 is not used for purposes other than to decide whether to send an account to human moderators and to monitor and improve the technology,” the company said in a blogpost.\n\n“By adopting this approach, we are able to deliver safety for teens in a privacy-preserving manner. We take our responsibility to protect our community, and teens in particular, incredibly seriously.”\n\nIt said other features to protect younger users on its service included not allowing under-16s to direct-message, while under-18s have a 60-minute screen-time limit and do not receive notifications “after bed time”.\n\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, also uses Yoti to verify users’ ages on Facebook.\n\nIn December, Australia implemented a social media ban for people under the age of 16. On Thursday, the country’s eSafety commissioner revealed that more than 4.7m accounts had been removed across 10 platforms – including YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Snap and Facebook – since the ban was implemented on 10 December.\n\nEarlier this week, Keir Starmer told MPs he was open to a social media ban for young people in the UK after becoming concerned about the amount of time children and teenagers were spending on their smartphones.\n\nThe prime minister told Labour MPs he had become alarmed at reports of five-year-olds spending hours in front of screens each day, as well as increasingly worried about the damage social media was doing to under-16s.\n\nStarmer has previously opposed banning social media for children, believing such a move would be difficult to police and could push teenagers towards the dark web.\n\nEarlier this month, Ellen Roome, whose 14-year-old son Jools Sweeney died after an online challenge went wrong, called for more rights for parents to access social media accounts of their children if they die.\n\nThe European parliament is pushing for age limits on social media, while Denmark wants to ban social media for those under 15.\n\nTikTok told Reuters the new technology was built specifically to comply with the EU’s regulatory requirements. The company has worked with Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, its lead EU privacy regulator, while developing the system.\n\nIn 2023, a Guardian investigation found that moderators were being told to allow under-13s to stay on the platform if they claimed their parents were overseeing their accounts.",
