    "fullText": "A far cry from hand-scrawled letters to Santa, on graphic design platform Canva users have created a whopping 1.4m Christmas wishlist presentations\n\nGet our weekend culture and lifestyle email\n\nTwas three weeks before Christmas, when all through the house, not a creature was stirring, except for my 13-year-old daughter, who emerged from her lair with a level of vim uncommon in daylight hours.\n\nAs she made her approach with laptop aglow, her droll little mouth was drawn up in a bow. It then became apparent that I was about to become the audience (some may say “victim”) of a recent cultural phenomenon: the Christmas wishlist slideshow.\n\nGraphic design platform Canva seems to be the tool of choice for many teenagers. Canva say the first Christmas wishlist template was added to their library in 2019. Since 2022, people have created more than 3.35m Christmas wishlist designs. Presentation-style wishlists have jumped 61% between 2024 and 2025, totalling 1.4m. Social media is awash with videos of exuberant adolescents in expensive sweatsuits making family presentations on huge TVs, along with countless tutorials on how to make them “aesthetic” – a word I never tire of reminding my children is a noun, not an adjective.\n\nSuffice to say it was not visions of sugar plums that had been dancing in my daughter’s head. Instead, I was treated to an initial collage of brands and stores that she holds in mysterious esteem, followed by a series of categorised slides covering the teenage perennials: clothes, jewellery, decor, beauty products and, thankfully, some books. While her slideshow featured images, “inspo” and prices, she refrained from the vulgarity of hyperlinks, which, judging by the online evidence, are a common addition. And, I guess, could be handy.\n\nIn my rigorous and highly scientific research (read: texting every parent in my contacts list) it was revealed that girls are the main perpetrators, usually embracing this nouveau custom in their late tweens before growing out of it a few years later. Many who were on the receiving end of these pitches appreciated the initiative and practicality, while at the same time lamenting the creep of bland online “get ready with me” and “unboxing” tropes into family traditions. As one friend, whose two boys had never subjected her to the experience, put it – it sounds a bit like people who spend too much time in office mode, then plan their camping holiday meals in an Excel spreadsheet.\n\nEfficient? Certainly. But is it as adorable as the hand-scrawled, misspelled and glitter-smeared entreaties for Santa’s benevolence we knew and loved? Not quite. But as those sanguine mementoes of her innocence gather dust in a drawer somewhere, I was surprised to appreciate the thought, effort and moderation she applied to her newfangled approach. She even added some “dupe” options “as a backup”. Well played, kid.\n\nWhile it’s hard to feel much seasonal magic emanating from a template-built pitch deck, there’s no denying it beats the look of thinly veiled disappointment when your best attempts fall flat. As my cousin said: “There are times in parenting when you just have to admit defeat and play by the rules of the new guard. God knows there’s only so much pity one can take from their teenager!”\n\nArmed with a mood board of colour palettes, preferred necklines, coveted cosmetics and (weep) a teddy bear, I told her, with confidence, it all looked feasible. Her eyes – how they twinkled! Her dimples, how merry!\n\nAnd there it was anew, that joy parents live for. Now, go to bed, please.",

    "description": "MacKenzie Scott has donated billions to charity after divorcing Jeff Bezos, and her style of giving stands out among major philanthropists.",
    "fullText": "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Scott ended their 25-year marriage in 2019 — and she's become a major philanthropic force in the years since.\n\nOn December 9, Scott announced that she'd donated close to $7.2 billion in the past year, bringing her total giving to more than $26 billion. Scott mentioned the 2025 total, her largest giving announcement to date, in a recent blog post on her philanthropy's site.\n\nThe donations went to colleges and a range of organizations, including ones focused on the environment, women's rights, and economic security.\n\nAs of December 2025, Scott was worth $33.8 billion, according to Forbes, making her one of the world's richest women. Her $38 billion divorce settlement from her split with Bezos kicked off her journey into charitable giving. A regulatory filing showed that Scott sold 42% of her Amazon stake in 2025, totaling roughly $12.6 billion.\n\nScott's giving differs from that of many billionaires. She gives large, unrestricted donations — bucking a common belief that nonprofits can't handle this type of gift.\n\n\"Its breadth and scale are unprecedented for a donor operating outside of a foundation structure,\" Elisha Smith Arrillaga, the VP of research at the Center for Effective Philanthropy, told Business Insider. \"For years, the relative scarcity of meaningfully sized, unrestricted gifts has been a source of frustration for nonprofit leaders.\"\n\nThe size of Scott's gifts enables the nonprofit to do long-term planning. Additionally, Scott forgoes the classic application process, which can be burdensome. Instead, \"her staff takes on the bulk of the vetting,\" Smith Arrillaga said.\n\n\"It's no overstatement to say that MacKenzie Scott has revolutionized philanthropy,\" Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, the CEO of a refugee charity that received a donation from Scott, previously told Business Insider.\n\nJust two months before her divorce, Scott had signed the Giving Pledge initiative, committing to giving away half her wealth. She's given away her money at a faster pace than most other major philanthropists, according to Forbes, donating nearly $2 billion in 2022, almost $2.2 billion in 2023, and around $2 billion in 2024, according to blog posts.\n\nMelinda French Gates, the former wife of Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, said in 2022 she had \"huge respect\" for Scott's \"trust-based\" approach to philanthropy.\n\nHowever, Scott's charitable giving has drawn criticism in the past from one of the world's richest people: Elon Musk.\n\nMusk, who has been a vocal critic of DEI initiatives, criticized Scott in 2024 while replying to another X user's claims that the majority of her chosen charities were organizations that \"deal with issues of race and/or gender.\"\n\nBut the SpaceX founder's comments have appeared to have no effect on Scott's philanthropy, as she's continued to donate to diversity-related causes.",

More than 9 million Australians use Pinterest each month.\n\nWednesday’s report found searches for 1980s luxury soared by 225%, “Scotland Highlands aesthetic” by 465% and “the poet aesthetic” by 175%. “Poetcore” – a key trend for Gen Z and millennials - takes its inspiration from the bookish: turtlenecks, fountain pens, satchels and ties.\n\nDriven by Gen Z and millennials, lace will be in, according to the data, including in doily, bandana and makeup form – as will khaki, field jackets and pleated trousers, aka the “paleontologist aesthetic”.\n\nThey’ll also be working an intergalactic “aliencore aesthetic”.\n\nFor Gen Z and millennials, travel will be adrenaline-seeking; for baby boomers, it will be to places that are “mystical” and “ethereal”. Searches for “Faroe Island aesthetic” almost doubled.\n\nPinterest predicts boomer and Gen X food trends to be cruciferous, with kimchi, dumplings and golumpki soup all raising the cabbage’s status. A younger trend for a “gummy bears aesthetic” goes beyond sweets and into makeup products and rubberised nail art.\n\nAnd “niche perfume collection” is having its moment in the sun, as are “perfume layering combinations”.\n\nPinterest said there was a theme uniting trends as disparate as masquerades and operas, dragonfly wing-patterned nails and animal-inspired outfits, forecasting a move towards individuality and away from imitation.\n\nMelinda Petrunoff, the managing director for Pinterest ANZ, told Guardian Australia that “people are craving comfort, authenticity and grounded optimism in a world that feels increasingly fast and often noisy”.\n\n“What’s driving this is a desire for individuality and self-preservation – people are moving towards curating rather than copying, choosing to engage with what truly resonates with them instead of chasing every viral moment,” she said.\n\n“We’re moving away from one-size-fits-all aesthetics and endless trend cycles that leave people feeling overwhelmed and disconnected.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will road-test his claims that he's tackling Americans' affordability woes at a Tuesday rally in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania — shifting an argument made in Oval Office appearances and social media posts to a campaign-style event.\n\nThe trip comes as polling consistently shows that public trust in Trump's economic leadership has faltered. Following dismal results for Republicans in last month's off-cycle elections, the White House has sought to convince voters that the economy will emerge stronger next year and that any anxieties over inflation have nothing to do with Trump.\n\nThe president has consistently blamed his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, for inflation even as his own aggressive implementation of policies has pushed up prices that had been settling down after spiking in 2022 to a four-decade high. Inflation began to accelerate after Trump announced his sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs in April. Companies warned that the import taxes could be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices and reduced hiring, yet Trump continues to insist that inflation has faded.\n\n“We’re bringing prices way down,\" Trump said at the White House on Monday. “You can call it ‘affordability’ or anything you want — but the Democrats caused the affordability problem, and we’re the ones that are fixing it.”\n\nThe president's reception in the county hosting his Tuesday rally could give a signal of just how much voters trust his claims. Monroe County flipped to Trump in the 2024 election after having backed Biden in 2020, helping the Republican to win the swing state of Pennsylvania and return to the White House after a four-year hiatus.\n\nAs home to the Pocono Mountains, the county has largely relied on tourism for skiing, hiking, hunting and other activities as a source of jobs. Its proximity to New York City — under two hours by car — has also attracted people seeking more affordable housing.\n\nIt's also an area that could help decide control of the House in next year's midterm elections.\n\nTrump is holding his rally in a congressional district held by freshman Republican Rep. Rob Bresnahan, who is a top target of Democrats and won his 2024 race by about 1.5 percentage points, among the nation’s closest. Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti, a Democrat, is running for the nomination to challenge him.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is running digital ads during Trump's visit on the Wilkes-Barre Times-Leader website that criticize Bresnahan for his stock trading while in Congress and suggest that Trump has not as promised addressed double-dealing in Washington.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Susie Wiles said on the online conservative talk show “The Mom View” that Trump would be on the “campaign trail” next year to engage supporters who otherwise might sit out a congressional race.\n\nWiles, who helped manage Trump's 2024 campaign, said most administrations try to localize midterm elections and keep the president out of the race, but she intends to do the opposite of that.\n\n“We’re actually going to turn that on its head,\" Wiles said, \"and put him on the ballot because so many of those low-propensity voters are Trump voters.”\n\nWiles added, “So I haven’t quite broken it to him yet, but he’s going to campaign like it’s 2024 again.”\n\nThe challenge for Trump is how to address the concerns of voters about the economy while simultaneously claiming that the economy is enjoying an historic boom.\n\nAsked on a Politico podcast about how he'd rate the economy, Trump leaned into the grade inflation by answering “A-plus,” only to then amend his answer to “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.”\n\nTrump has said he's giving consumers relief by relaxing fuel efficiency standards for autos and signing agreements to reduce list prices on prescription drugs.\n\nTrump has also advocated for cuts to the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate — which influences the supply of money in the U.S. economy. He argues that would reduce the cost of mortgages and auto loans, although critics warn that cuts of the scale sought by Trump could instead worsen inflation.\n\nThe U.S. economy has shown signs of resilience with the stock market up this year and overall growth looking solid for the third quarter. But many Americans see the prices of housing, groceries, education, electricity and other basic needs as swallowing up their incomes, a dynamic that the Trump administration has said it expects to fade next year with more investments in artificial intelligence and manufacturing.\n\nSince the elections in November when Democrats won key races with a focus on kitchen table issues, Trump has often dismissed the concerns about prices as a “hoax” and a “con job” to suggest that he bears no responsibility for inflation, even though he campaigned on his ability to quickly bring down prices. Just 33% of U.S. adults approve of Trump's handling of the economy, according to a November survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nLevy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",

    "description": "Dakota Johnson's fashion is effortlessly chic. It's also pretty daring. This year, she's worn a mix of both styles on and off the red carpet.",
    "fullText": "She wore classic black Gucci trousers with sharp pleats, a semi-sheer white blouse, and shiny black loafers from the Italian fashion house.\n\nThough understated, her outfit was expensive. Her shoes cost $1,050, and her pants cost $2,500.\n\nShe wore a chic $2,980 black midi dress from Khaite on the event's red carpet, which highlighted her accessories.\n\nThe latter included $1,140 haircalf heels from the clothing brand, a $2,350 Métier bag, $695 Sophie Buhai earrings, and two onyx rings from the same designer, which cost $2,050 each.\n\nInside the gala, she wore a white trench coat with thick buckles on top.\n\nShe wore a sheer Balenciaga bodysuit on one occasion, but covered it with a leather duster jacket.\n\nShe also sported black Balenciaga jeans, $990 Khaite wedges, The Row's $2,600 Mira clutch, an assortment of Yvonne Leon diamond jewelry, and $590 sunglasses from Khaite's collaboration with Oliver Peoples.\n\nShe wore a $5,200 sleeveless black Gucci dress with a deeply scooped neckline and a crystal hook across the back for the May event.\n\nThe outfit was pretty plain, but elevated thanks to her $1,120 Gucci heels, diamond stud earrings, and a $12,750 Boucheron ring.\n\nJohnson wore a Ferragamo fit that day to deliver an acting masterclass. It included a $1,750 scarf-embellished top, a miniskirt, and sheer tights.\n\nHer $2,900 boots, though, were the most daring piece of the ensemble. Designed by Yves Saint Laurent, the leather shoes featured 6.1-inch block heels and platforms across the toes.\n\nShe arrived at the event in a custom YSL slip dress with an orange floral print. The garment was understated by Johnson's standards, though her jewelry was anything but.\n\nShe wore $115,000 Boucheron earrings made from diamonds and white gold. The statement pieces were shaped like leaves.\n\nHer dress, a $2,450 piece from Mugler, was strapless with a plunging V-shaped neckline and a long, ankle-length skirt.\n\nTo complement the gown's daring cut, Johnson wore a diamond necklace with an emerald charm from Roberto Coin and a matching emerald ring.\n\nShe completed the look for the July event with $795 Gianvito Rossi pumps.\n\nJohnson mostly wore gowns throughout 2025, but she made an exception for the \"Splitsville\" premiere after-party.\n\nThat night, she wore a green Gucci minidress covered in sequins, paired with the fashion house's pointed black pumps.\n\nWhile walking around New York City, Johnson was photographed wearing a $98 semi-sheer Commando bodysuit beneath a yellow velvet jacket from Khaite.\n\nShe also wore simple blue jeans, $990 Khaite wedges in black, and dark Gucci sunglasses.\n\nThe daring aspect came in the form of her jewelry, which retails for a combined total of over $140,000. Johnson wore a $10,430 Ophelia Eve emerald necklace and a $130,200 Sophie Bille Brahe piece.\n\nInstead, she wore a strapless, seafoam gown from Valentino. The floor-length piece was crafted from textured fabric and featured a gathered waistline.\n\nThough its silhouette was straightforward, its color was a bold choice for the actor, which paid off.\n\nShe completed the look with jewels from Jessica McCormack.\n\nShe wore a strapless, form-fitting gown from Gucci in a striking silver color.\n\nIt contrasted her dark hair and was accessorized to perfection with statement earrings and bangles, all from Roberto Coin.\n\nHer Valentino gown had a halter neckline, a black mesh panel beneath its beaded top, and a floor-length skirt.\n\nThe dress was eye-catching and intricate in design.\n\nFor the \"Highest 2 Lowest\" premiere, Johnson walked the red carpet in a strapless Gucci gown covered with pink fringe. The vibrant color choice was a departure from her usual neutral fashion.\n\nShe also wore massive Boucheron earrings crafted from diamonds, which sparkled in the light.\n\nShe looked stunning in a strapless maxi gown from Ferragamo, which retails for $1,850, and pumps from the same brand.\n\nThe star of the show, however, was her $1.2 million Roberto Coin necklace. The eye-catching piece was crafted from diamonds, sapphires, and white gold, and it matched her $25,000 blue ring.\n\nShe wore the pieces shortly after being named the Italian jewelry brand's latest ambassador.\n\nAlessandra Rich designed her cutout dress with a strapless, plunging V-shaped neckline. It also had two waist cutouts and a daring slit in the middle of its skirt.\n\nJust as bold as the dress was Johnson's selection of jewelry. She wore sparkling rings, earrings, and layered necklaces that covered part of her collarbones and chest.\n\nGucci custom-made her sleeveless gown, which was semi-sheer and lined with a strapless leotard.\n\nShe paired the dress with an updo hairstyle and $56,000 Boucheron hoop earrings.\n\nDesigned by Gucci, the black gown had one long sleeve, an asymmetrical neckline, and fabric hanging down the front and back of her body.\n\nOn the sides, though, it was only held together by the brand's signature horsebit hooks. The latter detail revealed her legs and hips as she walked.\n\nHer Ferragamo ensemble included a $1,490 asymmetrical miniskirt and a $2,900 blazer with a curved neckline that dipped beneath her chest.\n\nShe completed the look with sheer black tights and the brand's $980 pumps.\n\nAfter a rumored breakup between Johnson and Chris Martin, the actor was photographed wearing a $775 tulle-wrapped bodysuit and a matching $1,366 sheer skirt from Nensi Dojaka.\n\nThe outfit was dramatic, fashionable, and undoubtedly one of her most daring looks of the year.\n\nChloé designed her billowing gown, which had short tiered sleeves, a deep V-neckline, and a floor-length skirt. The latter and the bodice were both see-through.\n\nThe outfit was daring, as is Johnson's signature, but it was also feminine and timeless.\n\nThat outfit, of course, was her blue Gucci ball gown. It featured a lace bodice with long sleeves, a high neckline, and a full tulle skirt.\n\nThe dress was as vibrant as it was daring. Johnson wore nothing beneath its see-through top.\n\nShe arrived at Kering's Caring for Women dinner wearing a high-neck, long-sleeved dress crafted from sparkling floral lace. The form-fitting Gucci piece sat atop two pieces of black lingerie.\n\nTo complete the look, Johnson added emerald earrings that matched the color of her eyes.",
