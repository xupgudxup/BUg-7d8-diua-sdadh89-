We're there to have fun and bring great tennis. Whoever wins, wins.\"",

    "fullText": "If search interest holds, glitchy glam, cool blue, aliencore and gummy bear aesthetics are among the vibes set to rock the creative world next year\n\nNext year, we’ll mostly be indulging in maximalist circus decor, working on our poetcore, hunting for the ethereal or eating cabbage in a bid for “individuality and self-preservation”, according to Pinterest.\n\nThe organisation’s predictions for Australian trends in 2026 have landed, which – according to the platform used by interior decorators, fashion lovers and creatives of all stripes – includes 1980s, aliens, vampires and “forest magic”.\n\nAmong the Pinterest 2026 trends report’s top 21 themes are “Afrohemian” decor (searches for the term are on the rise by baby boomers and Gen X); “glitchy glam” (asymmetric haircuts and mismatching nails); and “cool blue” (drinks, wedding dresses and makeup with a “glacier aesthetic”).\n\nPinterest compared English-language search data from September 2024 to August 2025 with those of the year before and claims it has an 88% accuracy rate. More than 9 million Australians use Pinterest each month.\n\nWednesday’s report found searches for 1980s luxury soared by 225%, “Scotland Highlands aesthetic” by 465% and “the poet aesthetic” by 175%. “Poetcore” – a key trend for Gen Z and millennials - takes its inspiration from the bookish: turtlenecks, fountain pens, satchels and ties.\n\nDriven by Gen Z and millennials, lace will be in, according to the data, including in doily, bandana and makeup form – as will khaki, field jackets and pleated trousers, aka the “paleontologist aesthetic”.\n\nThey’ll also be working an intergalactic “aliencore aesthetic”.\n\nFor Gen Z and millennials, travel will be adrenaline-seeking; for baby boomers, it will be to places that are “mystical” and “ethereal”. Searches for “Faroe Island aesthetic” almost doubled.\n\nPinterest predicts boomer and Gen X food trends to be cruciferous, with kimchi, dumplings and golumpki soup all raising the cabbage’s status. A younger trend for a “gummy bears aesthetic” goes beyond sweets and into makeup products and rubberised nail art.\n\nAnd “niche perfume collection” is having its moment in the sun, as are “perfume layering combinations”.\n\nPinterest said there was a theme uniting trends as disparate as masquerades and operas, dragonfly wing-patterned nails and animal-inspired outfits, forecasting a move towards individuality and away from imitation.\n\nMelinda Petrunoff, the managing director for Pinterest ANZ, told Guardian Australia that “people are craving comfort, authenticity and grounded optimism in a world that feels increasingly fast and often noisy”.\n\n“What’s driving this is a desire for individuality and self-preservation – people are moving towards curating rather than copying, choosing to engage with what truly resonates with them instead of chasing every viral moment,” she said.\n\n“We’re moving away from one-size-fits-all aesthetics and endless trend cycles that leave people feeling overwhelmed and disconnected.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will road-test his claims that he's tackling Americans' affordability woes at a Tuesday rally in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania — shifting an argument made in Oval Office appearances and social media posts to a campaign-style event.\n\nThe trip comes as polling consistently shows that public trust in Trump's economic leadership has faltered. Following dismal results for Republicans in last month's off-cycle elections, the White House has sought to convince voters that the economy will emerge stronger next year and that any anxieties over inflation have nothing to do with Trump.\n\nThe president has consistently blamed his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, for inflation even as his own aggressive implementation of policies has pushed up prices that had been settling down after spiking in 2022 to a four-decade high. Inflation began to accelerate after Trump announced his sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs in April. Companies warned that the import taxes could be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices and reduced hiring, yet Trump continues to insist that inflation has faded.\n\n“We’re bringing prices way down,\" Trump said at the White House on Monday. “You can call it ‘affordability’ or anything you want — but the Democrats caused the affordability problem, and we’re the ones that are fixing it.”\n\nThe president's reception in the county hosting his Tuesday rally could give a signal of just how much voters trust his claims. Monroe County flipped to Trump in the 2024 election after having backed Biden in 2020, helping the Republican to win the swing state of Pennsylvania and return to the White House after a four-year hiatus.\n\nAs home to the Pocono Mountains, the county has largely relied on tourism for skiing, hiking, hunting and other activities as a source of jobs. Its proximity to New York City — under two hours by car — has also attracted people seeking more affordable housing.\n\nIt's also an area that could help decide control of the House in next year's midterm elections.\n\nTrump is holding his rally in a congressional district held by freshman Republican Rep. Rob Bresnahan, who is a top target of Democrats and won his 2024 race by about 1.5 percentage points, among the nation’s closest. Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti, a Democrat, is running for the nomination to challenge him.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is running digital ads during Trump's visit on the Wilkes-Barre Times-Leader website that criticize Bresnahan for his stock trading while in Congress and suggest that Trump has not as promised addressed double-dealing in Washington.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Susie Wiles said on the online conservative talk show “The Mom View” that Trump would be on the “campaign trail” next year to engage supporters who otherwise might sit out a congressional race.\n\nWiles, who helped manage Trump's 2024 campaign, said most administrations try to localize midterm elections and keep the president out of the race, but she intends to do the opposite of that.\n\n“We’re actually going to turn that on its head,\" Wiles said, \"and put him on the ballot because so many of those low-propensity voters are Trump voters.”\n\nWiles added, “So I haven’t quite broken it to him yet, but he’s going to campaign like it’s 2024 again.”\n\nThe challenge for Trump is how to address the concerns of voters about the economy while simultaneously claiming that the economy is enjoying an historic boom.\n\nAsked on a Politico podcast about how he'd rate the economy, Trump leaned into the grade inflation by answering “A-plus,” only to then amend his answer to “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.”\n\nTrump has said he's giving consumers relief by relaxing fuel efficiency standards for autos and signing agreements to reduce list prices on prescription drugs.\n\nTrump has also advocated for cuts to the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate — which influences the supply of money in the U.S. economy. He argues that would reduce the cost of mortgages and auto loans, although critics warn that cuts of the scale sought by Trump could instead worsen inflation.\n\nThe U.S. economy has shown signs of resilience with the stock market up this year and overall growth looking solid for the third quarter. But many Americans see the prices of housing, groceries, education, electricity and other basic needs as swallowing up their incomes, a dynamic that the Trump administration has said it expects to fade next year with more investments in artificial intelligence and manufacturing.\n\nSince the elections in November when Democrats won key races with a focus on kitchen table issues, Trump has often dismissed the concerns about prices as a “hoax” and a “con job” to suggest that he bears no responsibility for inflation, even though he campaigned on his ability to quickly bring down prices. Just 33% of U.S. adults approve of Trump's handling of the economy, according to a November survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nLevy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",

    "description": "Dakota Johnson's fashion is effortlessly chic. It's also pretty daring. This year, she's worn a mix of both styles on and off the red carpet.",
    "fullText": "She wore classic black Gucci trousers with sharp pleats, a semi-sheer white blouse, and shiny black loafers from the Italian fashion house.\n\nThough understated, her outfit was expensive. Her shoes cost $1,050, and her pants cost $2,500.\n\nShe wore a chic $2,980 black midi dress from Khaite on the event's red carpet, which highlighted her accessories.\n\nThe latter included $1,140 haircalf heels from the clothing brand, a $2,350 Métier bag, $695 Sophie Buhai earrings, and two onyx rings from the same designer, which cost $2,050 each.\n\nInside the gala, she wore a white trench coat with thick buckles on top.\n\nShe wore a sheer Balenciaga bodysuit on one occasion, but covered it with a leather duster jacket.\n\nShe also sported black Balenciaga jeans, $990 Khaite wedges, The Row's $2,600 Mira clutch, an assortment of Yvonne Leon diamond jewelry, and $590 sunglasses from Khaite's collaboration with Oliver Peoples.\n\nShe wore a $5,200 sleeveless black Gucci dress with a deeply scooped neckline and a crystal hook across the back for the May event.\n\nThe outfit was pretty plain, but elevated thanks to her $1,120 Gucci heels, diamond stud earrings, and a $12,750 Boucheron ring.\n\nJohnson wore a Ferragamo fit that day to deliver an acting masterclass. It included a $1,750 scarf-embellished top, a miniskirt, and sheer tights.\n\nHer $2,900 boots, though, were the most daring piece of the ensemble. Designed by Yves Saint Laurent, the leather shoes featured 6.1-inch block heels and platforms across the toes.\n\nShe arrived at the event in a custom YSL slip dress with an orange floral print. The garment was understated by Johnson's standards, though her jewelry was anything but.\n\nShe wore $115,000 Boucheron earrings made from diamonds and white gold. The statement pieces were shaped like leaves.\n\nHer dress, a $2,450 piece from Mugler, was strapless with a plunging V-shaped neckline and a long, ankle-length skirt.\n\nTo complement the gown's daring cut, Johnson wore a diamond necklace with an emerald charm from Roberto Coin and a matching emerald ring.\n\nShe completed the look for the July event with $795 Gianvito Rossi pumps.\n\nJohnson mostly wore gowns throughout 2025, but she made an exception for the \"Splitsville\" premiere after-party.\n\nThat night, she wore a green Gucci minidress covered in sequins, paired with the fashion house's pointed black pumps.\n\nWhile walking around New York City, Johnson was photographed wearing a $98 semi-sheer Commando bodysuit beneath a yellow velvet jacket from Khaite.\n\nShe also wore simple blue jeans, $990 Khaite wedges in black, and dark Gucci sunglasses.\n\nThe daring aspect came in the form of her jewelry, which retails for a combined total of over $140,000. Johnson wore a $10,430 Ophelia Eve emerald necklace and a $130,200 Sophie Bille Brahe piece.\n\nInstead, she wore a strapless, seafoam gown from Valentino. The floor-length piece was crafted from textured fabric and featured a gathered waistline.\n\nThough its silhouette was straightforward, its color was a bold choice for the actor, which paid off.\n\nShe completed the look with jewels from Jessica McCormack.\n\nShe wore a strapless, form-fitting gown from Gucci in a striking silver color.\n\nIt contrasted her dark hair and was accessorized to perfection with statement earrings and bangles, all from Roberto Coin.\n\nHer Valentino gown had a halter neckline, a black mesh panel beneath its beaded top, and a floor-length skirt.\n\nThe dress was eye-catching and intricate in design.\n\nFor the \"Highest 2 Lowest\" premiere, Johnson walked the red carpet in a strapless Gucci gown covered with pink fringe. The vibrant color choice was a departure from her usual neutral fashion.\n\nShe also wore massive Boucheron earrings crafted from diamonds, which sparkled in the light.\n\nShe looked stunning in a strapless maxi gown from Ferragamo, which retails for $1,850, and pumps from the same brand.\n\nThe star of the show, however, was her $1.2 million Roberto Coin necklace. The eye-catching piece was crafted from diamonds, sapphires, and white gold, and it matched her $25,000 blue ring.\n\nShe wore the pieces shortly after being named the Italian jewelry brand's latest ambassador.\n\nAlessandra Rich designed her cutout dress with a strapless, plunging V-shaped neckline. It also had two waist cutouts and a daring slit in the middle of its skirt.\n\nJust as bold as the dress was Johnson's selection of jewelry. She wore sparkling rings, earrings, and layered necklaces that covered part of her collarbones and chest.\n\nGucci custom-made her sleeveless gown, which was semi-sheer and lined with a strapless leotard.\n\nShe paired the dress with an updo hairstyle and $56,000 Boucheron hoop earrings.\n\nDesigned by Gucci, the black gown had one long sleeve, an asymmetrical neckline, and fabric hanging down the front and back of her body.\n\nOn the sides, though, it was only held together by the brand's signature horsebit hooks. The latter detail revealed her legs and hips as she walked.\n\nHer Ferragamo ensemble included a $1,490 asymmetrical miniskirt and a $2,900 blazer with a curved neckline that dipped beneath her chest.\n\nShe completed the look with sheer black tights and the brand's $980 pumps.\n\nAfter a rumored breakup between Johnson and Chris Martin, the actor was photographed wearing a $775 tulle-wrapped bodysuit and a matching $1,366 sheer skirt from Nensi Dojaka.\n\nThe outfit was dramatic, fashionable, and undoubtedly one of her most daring looks of the year.\n\nChloé designed her billowing gown, which had short tiered sleeves, a deep V-neckline, and a floor-length skirt. The latter and the bodice were both see-through.\n\nThe outfit was daring, as is Johnson's signature, but it was also feminine and timeless.\n\nThat outfit, of course, was her blue Gucci ball gown. It featured a lace bodice with long sleeves, a high neckline, and a full tulle skirt.\n\nThe dress was as vibrant as it was daring. Johnson wore nothing beneath its see-through top.\n\nShe arrived at Kering's Caring for Women dinner wearing a high-neck, long-sleeved dress crafted from sparkling floral lace. The form-fitting Gucci piece sat atop two pieces of black lingerie.\n\nTo complete the look, Johnson added emerald earrings that matched the color of her eyes.",
