The most ambitious take on the format yet, Detroit: Become Human follows a rising android rebellion in a near-future setting where household robots have become commonplace.\n\nWith its focus on narrative decisions and investigative gameplay over action and combat, Detroit feels like a bit of an anomaly amongst modern adventure games--but there are plenty of games like Detroit: Become Human out there to explore\n\nWe’ve selected some of the best games like Detroit: Become Human for you to dive into next, with a focus on games where player choices help shape the branching narrative.

With a cast of four playable characters, each investigating a serial killer known as the Origami Killer, Heavy Rain's ambitious story can take many paths to multiple endings. The game's branching choices play out through slow-paced investigation scenes, interactions between characters, and intense action sequences navigated mostly through quick-time events--with potentially fatal outcomes for the characters if a key button press is missed. The game has multiple different endings for each character both bad and good, and the outcome of the central investigation also hinges on the player's actions. Initially released for the PS3, Heavy Rain has since been re-released for the PS4 (bundled with its successor Beyond: Two Souls) and also ported to PC.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fanatical.\n\nReleased in Telltale's heyday, The Walking Dead is easily one of the studio's best games. An episodic narrative game based on the comic book series of the same name, The Walking Dead sees players navigating the zombie apocalypse in the role of Lee Everett, a convicted criminal who finds himself looking after a young girl named Clementine. Unlike the majority of video games themed around zombies, The Walking Dead focuses more on the human element of its post-apocalyptic world, with interactions between characters often vital for survival. The game's action scenes are mostly handled through quick-time events in lieu of combat mechanics.\n\nA studio-defining title, Until Dawn was a breakout hit for Supermassive games, telling a trope-twisting teen horror story with many possible outcomes through its “butterfly effect” mechanic. The game follows eight teens on a trip to a mountain lodge, one year after two of their friends went missing on a similar trip. Each of the eight teens is playable at some point, and the choices the player makes for them--or their skill at hitting quick-time events--will determine who survives until dawn. The game feels like an homage to classic teen horror films, with its characters subjected to some good old-fashioned teen bullying alongside Until Dawn's terrifying supernatural threats. Until Dawn was so successful at nailing the feeling of a teen horror movie that it ended up being adapted into an actual film--which even took inspiration from the game’s branching narrative.\n\nAnother iconic game in the genre, Life Is Strange puts its own spin on the concept of the butterfly effect with a protagonist who has the ability to rewind time--allowing players to go back and choose different options almost instantly. Protagonist Max Caulfield has to come to grips with this mysterious new power, while also navigating the complexities high school life, and investigating a larger and darker mystery alongside childhood friend Chloe Price. The time-rewinding mechanic is used for puzzle-solving, and you'll also use exploration, item collecting, and branching dialogues with different characters to advance the story. Dontnod went on to make multiple games in the series, including a prequel Before the Storm and more recent direct sequel Double Exposure. Initially released as an episodic game, more recent re-releases have seen the Life is Strange collected and re-mastered.\n\nDon't let the RPG label put you off, Disco Elysium is far heavier on dialogue and player choices than it is on combat. Just like Detroit (and many other games in this list), Disco Elysium focuses on a detective who has been tasked with investigating a murder. The protagonist wakes up at the start of the game with amnesia, and it’s up to the player to then decide what kind of person he will be through a combination of dialogue choices and the game's unique skill tree. The isometric open-world game allows players to move through Elysium and interact with players and objects, with most other events resolved by skill checks based on dice rolls.\n\nAnother game from Detroit developer Quantic Dream, Beyond: Two Souls is critically polarizing, but still an interesting entry into a unique genre the studio pioneered. The game got a lot of attention for casting Hollywood stars in leading roles--Elliot Page played protagonist Jodie Holmes, and Willem Dafoe appeared as Jodie's father figure Nathan Dawkins. While most of its gameplay follows the classic Quantic Dream formula, Beyond shook things up through the addition of Aiden, an incorporeal soul linked to Jodie through a psychic tether. The player can choose to control Aiden instead of Jodie at times--or the game can be played in a multiplayer mode with a second player controlling Aiden. Unlike other Quantic Dream titles, Beyond: Two Souls only features one playable protagonist (not counting Aiden), and its narrative doesn’t branch quite as much, but players can still make a few major decisions, leading to various endings.\n\nThis gorgeous indie adventure game follows a group of teens who accidentally unleash a supernatural force on an overnight island trip. Players take control of protagonist Alex as she and her friends explore Edwards Island and try to unravel its mystery. The game's story is told entirely without cutscenes, with conversations happening as the characters walk through Oxenfree’s beautiful 2D environments. Alex can build and break relationships through these conversations, while using her handheld radio to solve puzzles and interact with the island's ghosts. Oxenfree has multiple possible outcomes for its teen characters, and several potential endings, as well as a new game plus mode that can further influence the story's outcome.\n\nA hard-boiled detective film in the form of a video game, L.A. Noire puts the player in the shoes of Detective Cole Phelps as he investigates crimes in 1947 Los Angeles. The game is split into various cases for the player to investigate, with an overarching conspiracy to be uncovered along the way. Each of the cases can be resolved with varying degrees of success depending on how much evidence the player manages to uncover. The game made big use of motion capture to animate the facial expressions of witnesses and suspects, allowing the player to pass judgement on who is lying and who is telling the truth. L.A. Noire is more action-oriented than others in the genre, involving combat with handguns and melee weapons, as well as action-packed chase scenes both on foot and in vehicles.\n\nThis reboot of the classic Sierra point-and-click adventure series was released episodically between 2015 and 2016, charting King Graham's rise to the throne and various adventures throughout his life. In King's Quest, players take control of Graham to explore different locations, solve puzzles, and investigate mysteries. Events both major and minor can be handled with three different approaches--bravery, wisdom, or compassion--with a player's choices throughout the game influencing what kind of person King Graham becomes. While the story is more linear than others in this list, the player still gets to make a handful of major choices that will influence how King's Quest plays out.\n\nA spiritual successor to Until Dawn, The Quarry is Supermassive's return to cliche teen horror, this time taking on the trope of a summer camp haunted by an unknown evil. The Quarry has nine playable characters, who can all live or die depending on the player's choices and skills throughout the game. Though its gameplay is mostly similar to Until Dawn, The Quarry features a multiplayer option where each character can be assigned to different player to control--potentially endangering or dooming their friends through their actions.\n\nIn Road 96, a group of teenagers attempt to flee the fictional authoritarian nation of Petria. The outcome of the story, and the fate of each of Road 96's playable characters, is affected by the decisions the player makes throughout the game. Each playthrough involves multiple characters--once one of the teens has either succeeded or failed to cross the border out of Petria, the player returns to the start of a different character's journey, with Road 96's finale taking place on Petria's tumultuous election day. The various encounters characters have along the road are procedurally generated, and there are multiple different ways to travel--catching buses, stealing cars, hitchhiking, hailing taxis, or simply walking. Like other games with branching narratives, Road 96 is designed to be played through multiple times, with each playthrough taking a different path to a different end.\n\nThe predecessor to Heavy Rain, this early Quantic Dream title was released as Fahrenheit outside the USA, where it was renamed Indigo Prophecy, and tells the story of a supernaturally possessed serial killer and the two detectives on his trail. Fahrenheit introduced concepts and features that would become fundamental to Quantic Dream's distinctive style of game, including the idea of a changing and evolving narrative based on character choices, and a focus on characters' journeys and mental states over combat or action elements. While Quantic Dreams' more recent games have definitely refined the formula, the original is still well worth a look.\n\nThis interactive narrative game was helmed by a developer who previously worked on Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls at Quantic Dream, and plenty of the studio's character-forward, narrative-heavy signature can be seen in As Dusk Falls. The game sees two very different families collide in the small desert town of Two Rock, Arizona following a car accident. Players guide multiple characters through a tense, ever-escalating confrontation between the families that spans two time periods. As Dusk Falls takes a democratic approach to multiplayer, allowing up to eight players to vote on what action should be taken next, with online, offline, and cross-platform multiplayer options available. Each player can also use a limited number of overrides, which will ensure that their option is picked.\n\nA niche third-person shooter from the creator of the Yakuza series, Binary Domain's story of a robot uprising and its interrogation of the personhood of humanoid androids covers very similar story beats to Detroit: Become Human. While its combat-heavy gameplay sets it apart from most of the games on this list, Binary Domain also features a unique \"consequence system\" that has the potential to change elements of the gameplay, story, and even the ending the player will experience. The consequence system tracks how the eight-person Rust Crew feels about player-character Dan Marshall, with the character interactions becoming just as important to Binary Domain as its combat. The game even has an android squadmate, exploring the sometimes uneasy relationship between man and machine.\n\nAnother title from Telltale's golden age, The Wolf Among Us was one of the narrative-focused studio's biggest hits. Based on the Fables comic series, The Wolf Among Us follows Bigby Wolf, the sheriff of Fabletown, as he investigates a series of strange murders. The gameplay involves investigating scenes and objects, talking to other characters in branching dialogue trees, and navigating action scenes through quick-time events. The game's dialogue choices run on a timer, forcing players to make quick decisions or let the timer run out and say nothing at all. The Wolf Among Us initially released in five episodes, but has since been collected into a single game and ported to a bunch of different platforms.\n\nJust like Detroit, Nobody Wants To Die sees the player take on the role of detective in a futuristic world, where technology can be used to analyse exactly what happened at the scene of a crime. The game is set in a world where human consciousness can be stored like data and switched between bodies, effectively extending the human lifespan indefinitely. The player character is James Karra, a detective on the trail of a serial killer who appears to be targeting the elites of the game’s futuristic vision of New York City. The branching narrative game features multiple endings based on the player's choices, with gameplay mostly consisting of investigating crime scenes and interrogating witnesses and other NPCs.\n\nOriginally conceived as a follow-up to Remedy's Alan Wake, Quantum Break instead ended up its own unique beast, featuring a time-manipulating protagonist and a future-sighted antagonist. One of the more action-oriented games on this list, protagonist Jack Joyce uses his time abilities to take on enemies in combat, but he can also use those abilities to investigate scenes and even replay past events. While many of the games on this list take inspiration from film and TV, Quantum Break takes that one step further by incorporating a live-action TV show into the game itself. Quantum Break is split up into five acts--at the end of each, the player is tasked with making a pivotal decision as antagonist Paul Serene, which is followed by an episode of the in-game TV show. Just like the game, the show has the potential to change based on the player's choices, with hidden scenes to unlock through multiple playthroughs.\n\nA new game from some of the developers behind the original Life is Strange, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage is a two-part adventure game about a group of four girls during two different time periods--as teenagers in 1995, and reunited again 27 years later. Bloom & Rage is played entirely from the perspective of just one of the girls, Swann, who records events and subjects with her camcorder to be edited into her memoir. As adults, the group meets up to reminisce, at times struggling to remember what happened in the summer of 1995 that led them to part ways with no further contact. The events of the game will play out differently depending on what choices the characters make, and can even change depending on how much trust the player has managed to build with the other characters. Bloom & Rage is intended to be more than just a standalone game for Don't Nod, with more games being planned under the Lost Records label.\n\nWork as a superhero dispatcher in this workplace comedy-style game, where both your strategic choices and your relationships with your colleagues will impact how the narrative plays out. You play as Robert Robertson III, an employee of the Superhero Dispatch Network (SDN) who is demoted from hero to dispatcher after his mecha suit is destroyed. Following in the footsteps of some of the classic narrative games of the 2010s, Dispatch is made up of eight episodes, initially released over a period of two months though they can now be played in full. Dispatch boasts an impressive voice cast including actors Aaron Paul and Jeffrey Wright, prominent gaming voice actors including Matt Mercer and Laura Bailey, influencers like Jacksepticeye and MoistCr1tikal, and even rapper Yung Gravy.\n\nSupermassive’s Dark Pictures Anthology is a series of narrative horror games--similar in tone and gameplay to its breakout hit Until Dawn, but smaller in scale. While the anthology’s games can be hit or miss, House Of Ashes is easily the strongest of the series so far and is worth a play for fans of Supermassive’s other games. Set during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the game features five playable characters--four of them members of the US Armed Forces, and one Iraqi Republican Guard. Finding themselves in a long-forgotten Akkadian temple beset by an ancient evil, the protagonists must put aside their allegiances to survive a deadlier supernatural threat. The third of a planned eight games in the Dark Pictures series, House of Ashes is the first in the anthology to start hinting at a bigger picture tying all of the ostensibly-unrelated games together.",

Pep Guardiola will hope this season does not derail in similar fashion to last season.\n\nPatched up because of a growing list of injuries, City are seeing their title challenge fall apart. They have now drawn three games in a row. As Wednesday's match against Brighton finished 1-1, there were a few jeers at full-time.\n\nFrom 1 January to 1 February, City have a run of 10 games in four different competitions. It is an arduous sequence, one to push them to their limit. With draws against Sunderland, Chelsea and now Brighton, they have so far not been up to the test.\n\nIf Arsenal beat Liverpool on Thursday, City will be eight points off the top with 17 games to play.\n\n\"The result is the result,\" said Guardiola. \"One point for them, one point for us. It is what it is.\n\n\"The second half was quite similar against Sunderland and Chelsea - we missed the passes. I like a lot the way we play... many new players and many new things... but we don't score goals.\n\n\"Too many clear chances and all the people up front... unfortunately we could not score.

    "title": "Adidas could be in trouble as a 20-year shift towards more casual attire comes to an end",
    "description": "The \"decasualization\" of fashion over two decades is finally winding down, and BofA says Adidas stock is at risk.",
    "fullText": "We as a society are far more casual than we used to be.\n\nPeople wear full-on pajamas to the airport. TV hosts regularly wear sneakers with suits on live broadcasts. You might even see a sports commentator wearing a hoodie under their suit.\n\nYou can probably get away with wearing jeans to dinner most places these days. Athleisure retailers like Vuori and Alo sell sweatpants for the same price as a nice pair of slacks (or more).\n\nBank of America has noticed too, and thinks the trend has peaked. In new research, the firm said we've reached the logical endpoint for a 20-year trend of \"casualization,\" a period that saw sneakers explode from 20% of the footwear market, all the way to 50%.\n\nThat's bad news for Adidas, which will see organic sales growth shrink into the single digits as its brand loses luster, according to BofA.\n\nThe firm thinks the situation for Adidas is so dire, in fact, that it took the bold step of double-cutting its rating on the company's stock to \"underperform,\" from \"buy.\"\n\nAt a time when peers are almost overwhelmingly bullish on shares after a difficult 2025, it decided to zigzag and post the most bearish price target on Wall Street. Shares fell as much as 7% on Tuesday. But analysts on the whole remain quite bullish on Adidas shares following a 29% drop in 2025.\n\nBofA thinks other major players in the sneaker space that have benefited from the same upcycle as Adidas — like Asics and On — will continue to pose as serious competition as consumers pivot more from casual attire towards sporting goods.\n\nThe sportswear giant — and recent beneficiary of some viral marketing, courtesy of captured Venezuelan President Maduro — is in the midst of its own turnaround under boomerang CEO Elliott Hill. The company's last earnings report saw strong North American growth drive a sales increase, a key signal for positive future prospects.\n\nAnd while Nike's stock hasn't exactly been a bright spot, down 14% since the start of 2025, that's still less than half of Adidas' decline over the period.\n\nBofA says a sustained recovery for Nike could come at Adidas' expense, since the two companies have historically seen inverse revenue growth. In other words, if Nike grows, Adidas contracts, and vice versa.\n\nBut wait, what about the World Cup? Surely defending champion and Adidas golden boy Lionel Messi will drive massive sales during this summer's tournament?\n\nNot so fast, says BofA. Once the endorphin rush of the World Cup passes, the firm says Adidas will be faced with the same old issues through year-end.\n\nAlthough BofA expects Adidas' share price to suffer, the company's plight could come with one key silver lining: the end of the sneakers-with-suits epidemic. One can only hope.",

    "description": "Texas A&M beat Auburn 90-88 on Tuesday night after a review determined that a buzzer-beater didn't quite get off in time.",
    "fullText": "KeShawn Murphy thought he had hit a ridiculous deep buzzer-beater to lift Auburn past Texas A&M on Tuesday night.\n\nMurphy, with Auburn down by two points, caught an inbounds pass with just 0.6 seconds left on the clock, turned and fired. His shot was perfect, and sparked a massive celebration at Neville Arena. The shot looked like it was one of the first truly great buzzer-beaters of the college basketball season, several months before March even hit.\n\nBut unfortunately for Murphy and the Tigers, a review from the officials determined that the release was just a little too late. Murphy didn’t get the shot off in time, and the points were called off. That gave the Aggies the 90-88 road win, and left them celebrating in front of a stunned arena instead.\n\nWILD ENDING 🤯 \n\nThis supposed buzzer-beater from Auburn was overturned after review to give Texas A&M the win. pic.twitter.com/oxjZEHlWGH\n\n— SEC Network (@SECNetwork) January 7, 2026\n\n\"I don't have a clear understanding still,\" Auburn coach Steven Pearl said, via WSFA12's Rosie Langello-Hodgens. \"I still gotta gather more information and get an understanding as to what their determination was ... Just from the angles that I saw, it looked like the ball was out of his hands on the red light, on the scoreboard that we were looking at. But I would imagine that they had a different angle they were looking at to determine the ball wasn't out of his hands.\"\n\nPearl had a conversation with the SEC after the game, and he was seen meeting with athletic director John Cohen and officials on the court well after speaking with reporters.\n\nTexas A&M rallied from a 16-point hole to grab the win over the Tigers, which got them to 12-3 on the season and kept them a perfect 2-0 in SEC play. Pop Isaacs led the way with 21 points off the bench after he shot 7-of-12 from the field, and Jacari Lane added 17 points and seven rebounds. The Aggies have now won five straight entering Saturday's game with Oklahoma.\n\nKeyshawn Hall led Auburn with 32 points and 12 rebounds in the loss, and Kevin Overton finished with 16 points. Murphy had eight points and eight rebounds.

    "description": "A speculative ‘Episode 14’ of 'Civilisation' in the spirit of Kenneth Clark, observing how courtesy, discipline, curiosity, conscience, and patience shaped the invisible civic infrastructure of the digital age.",
    "fullText": "When this series last ended in 1969, Kenneth Clark left behind an unease. The modern world possessed immense energy and extraordinary technical power, yet what earlier civilisations had assumed almost instinctively — a centre — was no longer obvious.\n\nIn the decades since, progress has only accelerated. Communication has become global, calculation instantaneous, and information pervasive. These achievements are remarkable. But power alone does not create civilisation. Energy, however abundant, does not by itself produce order. Without shared forms — without agreement about how knowledge is shaped, preserved, and handed on — progress becomes empty motion.\n\nAnd yet civilisation did not collapse.\n\nWe did not abandon the physical world — we still enjoy good food, need sleep, and seek shelter from the cold. But the centre of our shared life began to shift. Increasingly, what mattered most was not the mass of things we possessed, but the structures through which we cooperated: the ways knowledge was recorded, shared, corrected, and carried forward. In these invisible arrangements, civilisation found new means of continuity.\n\nIt is this reconfiguration — subtle, incomplete, and still fragile — that I want to consider here.\n\nThis development was not, in truth, without precedent. Civilisation has never been sustained by authority alone. Even in periods of strong government or settled belief, its real work has relied on voluntary association — on people choosing to cooperate around a shared purpose worth sustaining.\n\nIn the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, this impulse found expression in what came to be known as the Republic of Letters. It was a territory defined not by borders, but by ink. Ideas travelled slowly between desks and studies, often ignoring the wars of their kings. A philosopher in Paris could dispute first principles with a mathematician in Cambridge; a writer in exile could remain part of a continental conversation.\n\nThey shared no ruler and acknowledged no single doctrine. They differed sharply in temperament and belief, yet understood themselves to be citizens of the same country. What bound them were standards: of evidence, of argument, and of courtesy. Knowledge, in this world, was not a possession to be hoarded, but a light to be shared.\n\nFor a long time, this spirit receded from view. The industrial age taught us the virtues of enclosure. We built fences around land, walls around factories, and increasingly, legal barriers around ideas. Where value was material, scarce, and costly to produce, ownership became the principal means by which it was recognised and protected — and it still serves us well.\n\nBut toward the end of the twentieth century, a curious pattern re-emerged. Among scientists, engineers, and students working at the edges of a new digital machinery, the established forms of enclosure proved inadequate. To build systems of great complexity with unprecedented reach, one could not behave solely as a proprietor. One had to act, instead, as a participant.\n\nGradually, and without central direction, new commons took shape. Spaces in which the work of one person was offered to the use of many; in which contribution mattered more than possession; and in which rules were sustained not by decree, but by shared understanding. These arrangements relied on a quiet optimism — the belief that human beings, given the opportunity, would prefer to build together rather than to destroy alone.\n\nThey remain fragile. They are easily misunderstood, and easily neglected. Yet upon this assumption — modest, generous, and profoundly human — much of our contemporary civilisation has come to rest.\n\nThe reordering of our digital world began, fittingly, not in a marketplace, but in a place of inquiry. By the late 1980s, computers were already powerful and networks increasingly widespread, yet information remained confined within isolated systems. To move from one to another required a change of language, protocol, or machine. Knowledge existed, but it did not yet flow.\n\nTim Berners-Lee, then working as a physicist and engineer, recognised in this fragmentation something deeper than technical inconvenience: an obstacle to the exchange of ideas. He proposed a simple remedy: a way for documents on different computers to be linked together, addressed through common rules, and retrieved by anyone connected to the network. The means were spare—uniform addresses, shared protocols, plain documents.\n\nAt the time, the prevailing logic was clear. New technologies were enclosed, patented, licensed. They became assets, and then territories. This approach had shaped much of the modern world, and often served it well. But Berners-Lee declined it. He did not claim ownership of the Web, nor place it behind fees or permissions. Instead, he released its protocols openly, allowing anyone to use and build upon them.\n\nThe decision appeared almost administrative. In retrospect, it was decisive. A system intended to connect the world could not begin by demanding entry. By refusing to own the Web, Berners-Lee allowed it to function as neutral ground — a public space without a gatekeeper.\n\nClark once described courtesy as the discipline by which we restrain our own claims in order to make room for others. In this sense, the Web was an act of courtesy expressed in technology. Its enduring power lies as much in its refusals as in its capabilities.\n\nFrom that restraint flowed much that followed.\n\nIf the Web was founded on an act of courtesy, the system that made it durable was built on something more bracing: an uncompromising respect for how things actually work.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Linus Torvalds, then a student at the University of Helsinki, began writing the core of an operating system. The impulse was practical rather than ideological. His professor, Andrew S. Tanenbaum, had created MINIX—an elegant, Unix-inspired teaching system—so that students could study the anatomy of an operating system. But MINIX was not intended for everyday use, and it did not run on Torvalds’s own machine in the way he required.\n\nOut of a mixture of curiosity and irritation, he decided to build something that would.\n\nWhat is striking, even in hindsight, is how complete that decision already was. The earliest public release of Linux was not a sketch or a manifesto. It was a working kernel: multitasking, memory-managed, architecturally coherent. It revealed, from the outset, a deep and practical understanding of how operating systems behave under real constraints. Authority, in this case, did not need to be asserted. It was visible in the code.\n\nWhen the system reached a point where others might find it useful, Torvalds released it with a plain invitation: use it, improve it, tell me what breaks.\n\nThere was no manifesto and no appeal to higher ideals. There was simply work to be done.\n\nHe did not come to this characteristic pragmatism from a vacuum. He had begun programming at the age of eleven, and grew up in a household where intellectual argument was neither rare nor intimidating. His parents were journalists, his grandfather a statistician. Ideas, facts, and disagreement were part of ordinary conversation, not marks of authority.\n\nHe was named, with ambiguity, after the scientist and peace activist Linus Pauling—or, as he later remarked, perhaps equally after the Linus from Peanuts. The joke is revealing. It suggests a temperament comfortable with seriousness, but resistant to solemnity; respectful of ideas, but impatient with reverence.\n\nThat impatience would become legendary. Torvalds was blunt, intolerant of sloppy reasoning, and openly dismissive of work that failed to meet clear standards. In another setting, such a manner might have proved destructive. In this one, it served a clarifying purpose.\n\nWhat emerged around Linux surprised almost everyone. Programmers from across the world began to contribute—not because they were commanded to, and not because they were paid, but because the standards were unmistakable and the results visible. Authority arose where competence was demonstrated. Disputes were frequent, sometimes fierce, but they were settled not by rank, but by the quality of the work itself.\n\nLinux showed that order need not depend on hierarchy. It could arise from shared standards, rigorous review, and a willingness to reject what did not meet them. The collaboration endured not because everyone agreed, but because disagreement was channelled into improvement rather than paralysis.\n\nToday, the result of that discipline is so pervasive that it has become effectively invisible. Linux runs the watch on a wrist and the rocket in the void; it governs the flow of global finance and the monitors of intensive care. The banker, the surgeon, and the statesman rely upon it every second of their lives, yet few could name it—or the man who began it. It has become the silent, universal substrate of modern civilisation.\n\nAs the project grew, a new problem appeared. The accumulation of changes—branching paths, conflicting versions, overlapping experiments—threatened to overwhelm its own history. Torvalds’s response was direct. He built a tool to address the problem properly, from first principles, in a matter of days.\n\nIt is an obstinate word for an obstinate tool. Torvalds explained the choice with a certain wry self-knowledge: “I’m an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself.” This joke was a refusal to pretend otherwise.\n\nGit altered the way collective memory was handled. Instead of a single, authorised record guarded at the centre, it allowed every participant to hold a complete and inspectable history. Experiments could diverge without endangering the whole, and failures could be acknowledged without erasure. Continuity was preserved without supervision, and responsibility without humiliation.\n\nIn civilisational terms, this was no small matter. Git provided what large institutions have always struggled to maintain: a reliable memory that tolerates error while remaining accountable. It made cooperation at scale possible, and more importantly, sustainable.\n\nTorvalds rarely spoke of these achievements in elevated language, and perhaps that is part of their strength. He distrusted abstraction and disliked ceremony. Yet through an insistence on standards—sometimes uncomfortable, often demanding—he demonstrated that order can emerge without command.\n\nIf Berners-Lee’s restraint made room for others to enter, Torvalds’s discipline made it possible for them to stay—and to build.\n\nWe have spoken of individuals, but civilisation does not advance by solitary effort alone. Ideas endure only when they are taken up, tested, corrected, and carried forward by others. What followed the release of the Web and Linux was therefore not an anomaly, but an ascent — collective, distributed, and largely unplanned.\n\nOut of this discipline grew structures capable of sustaining effort at scale. Organisations such as the Linux Foundation, the Apache Software Foundation, and the Eclipse Foundation did not command creativity so much as shelter it—providing neutral ground where competing firms, independent developers, and public institutions could collaborate without surrendering control to any single interest.\n\nThese great foundations, joined by a constellation of individual efforts, quietly became both the backbone and the surface of the modern world. They supplied the invisible servers and operating systems upon which industry depends, extending that order to the programming languages, development tools, and utility applications that weave through the texture of daily life.\n\nEarlier civilisations had known voluntary scholarship and shared intellectual purpose. What they lacked were the means to sustain such efforts beyond a narrow elite. The Republic of Letters relied on slow correspondence and fragile memory. Here, by contrast, the technical conditions had fallen into place. The Web offered a common space of address; Git provided a disciplined way to coordinate distributed work while preserving the history of every path taken; and systems like Linux supplied a stable, universal substrate at the machine level.\n\nTogether, these tools did not create generosity — but they gave it form, continuity, and reach. Contribution could be preserved rather than lost, disagreement recorded rather than erased, and improvement accumulated without dissolving into chaos. For the first time, cooperation among strangers could be both rigorous and durable.\n\nWhat emerged was neither a utopia nor a rebellion against institutions. It was a practice — demanding, sometimes severe, but remarkably productive. Authority arose where competence was demonstrated, and responsibility where work was accepted. In this way, the invisible commons acquired not only energy, but memory.\n\nIt was a modest beginning, and an unfinished one. But it marked something new in the history of civilisation: a means by which collective effort could outlast enthusiasm, survive disagreement, and leave behind structures strong enough to build upon.\n\nA way, at last, toward permanence.\n\nCivilisations have always faltered not for lack of knowledge, but for lack of finding it. The great library of Alexandria held its wealth in scrolls; the digital commons held it in billions of fragments, scattered and multiplying. The crisis was one of orientation.\n\nIt required a particular kind of genius to address this: not the genius of the poet, who creates new worlds, but the genius of the librarian, who imposes order upon the old.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, then students at Stanford University,approached this problem with an engineer’s impatience with chaos. They recognised that within the tangled mess of the Web, there lay a hidden structure. Links were more than mere decorations; they were judgments. Every reference implied trust, relevance, and attention. If these signals could be measured, the cacophony of human knowledge might order itself, without the need for a central censor.\n\nPage and Brin set out to implement this theory with their own hands. Much of the early system—from the crawling of pages to the ranking of results—was coded by them, tested against the crushing weight of the real Web, and refined through sleepless nights. Their authority rested on a simple, undeniable premise: they had made the thing work.\n\nTheir ambition, expressed with an engineer’s disarming simplicity, was among the broadest in human history:\n\nBasically, our goal is to organize the world’s information and to make it universally accessible and useful.\n\nFew statements have carried such consequence with so little ornament.\n\nWhat emerged was more profound than a commercial search engine — and more consequential than its creators could fully foresee. It was a new cognitive infrastructure, the likes of which had never existed. Questions that once required travel, training, or immense patience could now be answered in moments. Curiosity ceased to be a privilege of the leisured class. It became a habit of the multitude.\n\nThe organisation they built, Google, quickly outgrew its original function. To organise the world’s information at planetary scale required inventions far beyond indexing. It required a new kind of architecture: distributed computation, fault-tolerant systems, and coordination at unprecedented scale. In solving its own problems, Google was forced to become a builder of new civic infrastructure.\n\nHere, the spirit of the commons reasserted itself in an unexpected form. Having built their edifice upon the open foundations of Linux, Page and Brin began to return the scaffolding to the world. They released Android, placing a general-purpose operating system into billions of hands; they gifted Kubernetes, providing a common language for managing complexity across industries.\n\nThese were acts of calculated necessity. They understood that no single organisation—not even one as vast as theirs—could sustain such complex systems alone.\n\nThis created a productive tension. Google became both a citadel of proprietary power and a primary engine of open infrastructure. It demonstrated that in the modern age, collaboration is more than an ideal; it is a structural necessity.\n\nSuch power inevitably casts shadows. To control the map is to influence how others move, and the risks of such centralisation are real. Yet the original impulse remains unmistakable: a belief that knowledge, once organised, should belong to everyone — and that the tools required to manage this complexity should not be locked behind walls.\n\nPage and Brin belong, in Clark’s sense, among the God-given geniuses who realised their own ambitious visions. They recognised a crisis of confusion in the civilisational record, and with their own craft, built a working answer.\n\nCuriosity, once given structure, became infrastructure.\n\nWhat followed would test how the use of such infrastructure should be judged — and at what human cost.\n\nIf the story ended with the triumph of the Web and the ordering of the map, we might be tempted to call it a victory. But history suggests otherwise. When the pace of civilisation accelerates, it often leaves its institutions behind. And in that widening gap, there are casualties.\n\nAaron Swartz stood squarely in that gap.\n\nBorn in 1986 near Chicago, Swartz was a prodigy, a builder, and — in a deeper sense — a conscience. He belonged naturally to the world of the commons we have been describing, fluent in its technical languages and serious about its moral claims. For him, openness was a principle to be acted upon.\n\nHis contributions began with something deceptively modest. He helped create Markdown, a syntax that appears, at first glance, to be nothing more than plain text. Yet this simplicity was a philosophical choice. By stripping away the complex, fragile interfaces of modern word processing, Markdown liberated the writer to focus on the hierarchy of ideas rather than their ornamentation. It restored a necessary discipline to the act of writing, ensuring that the structure of an argument remained visible, honest, and distinct from its display.\n\nBut the implications of this choice extended far beyond the quiet of the study. Swartz understood that for knowledge to endure, it must be separable from the tools used to create it. Because Markdown treated text as structured data, a document was no longer a dead artifact, but an active component of a system. A specification written in this way could be transformed, by the simplest of scripts, into a website, a technical manual, or even executable code. It opened the way for streamlining the chaotic passage from abstract policy to concrete production, creating an unbroken chain between intention and execution.\n\nIn this sense, Markdown pointed toward a form of civic legibility: a way in which the vast records of society—its laws, its data, its history—might remain intelligible to both human eyes and machine logic, safe from the rot of proprietary obsolescence. It was a small tool, but it became the essential mortar for a civilisation built on code.\n\nBut Swartz’s concern for access did not end with tools. He saw that while the machinery of the commons had become open, many of the great storehouses of human knowledge remained closed. Scholarly research — much of it publicly funded — was locked behind paywalls, accessible primarily to those already inside the gates. To Swartz, this inefficiency rose to the level of moral error.\n\nHis response was literal and uncompromising. In 2011, he attempted to make available a large body of academic work, not for profit, but as an assertion of principle. It was an act of civil disobedience, closer in spirit to the old librarians than to the modern hacker stereotype. Where the digital world saw a custodian of knowledge, the institution saw a violator of rules.\n\nThe collision was severe. Swartz encountered a legal and prosecutorial machinery calibrated for deterrence rather than judgment, and example rather than proportion. The weight of the response far exceeded the scale of the act. What followed is well known, and remains difficult to contemplate.\n\nIt would be easy, at this point, to simplify the story — to assign villains and heroes, to turn tragedy into rhetoric. That would be a mistake. The institutions acted from procedure, Swartz from conviction. What failed here was something more elusive: a shared understanding of how ideals, once embedded in technology, should be reflected in law.\n\nClark once insisted that civilisation depends not only on knowledge, but on sympathy — on the capacity to recognise ourselves in others. The tragedy took the form of a collision: between a commons that had learned to move, and institutions that had not yet learned how to follow. Swartz’s life and death force an uncomfortable question: whether a society that builds its future on openness can afford to treat its most literal adherents as adversaries.\n\nHis story marks the point at which the invisible commons ceased to be merely a technical achievement, and became a moral test. It revealed that access, order, and power cannot be aligned by engineering alone. They require judgment and restraint — and, above all, a sense of proportion.\n\nIn the years that followed, the shock of this failure was not entirely absorbed in silence. Laws were re-examined, prosecutorial practices questioned, and the assumption that access could be criminalised without consequence began, slowly, to weaken. Institutions did not become wiser overnight — but they became more aware.\n\nCivilisation learns unevenly, and often at great cost — usually after the fact. Its progress has rarely depended on perfect obedience, and still less on moral comfort. Again and again, it has been forced forward by individuals willing to test the distance between what is lawful and what is just — and to bear the consequences of that test.\n\nAny consolation that remains lies in memory. Swartz’s insistence did not vanish with him. It entered the moral consciousness of the commons itself, where future generations may yet recognise that law, like technology, cannot remain untouched by human consequence.\n\nIn February 2025, a bust of Aaron Swartz was unveiled in the lobby of the Internet Archive in San Francisco — an institution dedicated to preserving the world’s knowledge and keeping it accessible. Its placement is telling: among readers, archives, and use, rather than courts or seats of power. It marks no victory, announces no verdict, and offers no absolution.\n\nIt simply reminds those who pass beneath it that the commons was not built by compliance alone — and that civilisation, if it is to endure, must always leave room for conscience to speak before the law has learned how to listen.\n\nAfter the moral strain of collision, it is necessary to return to first principles — this time of learning itself. Civilisation, after all, is not preserved by systems alone. It is preserved by transmission: by one mind taking the time to explain something carefully to another.\n\nIn 2004, Sal Khan began without a grand design to reform education. He was tutoring a cousin through the web. The subject was mathematics, and the medium he chose was austere: a black screen, a trail of coloured digital ink, and a voice. This created an aesthetic of pure concentration. The learner watched the thought itself unfolding in real time. Unencumbered by institutional theories or the language of disruption, the work relied entirely on the clarity of the explanation.\n\nFrom this modest beginning grew Khan Academy — an online platform that functioned as a repository of patience. Its distinguishing quality lay in its tone. Concepts were broken down slowly, without embarrassment, and rebuilt step by step, treating the learner simply as an unfinished mind requiring only time and method to complete itself.\n\nThis approach addressed a failure that Clark had observed long before. He remarked that the so-called “top people” of earlier generations were often charming but poorly informed, while students in provincial universities were sharper, more curious, and more alert. The barrier between them was access—specifically, access to explanation.\n\nKhan Academy demonstrated that high culture could be shared in its full complexity. Calculus, physics, economics, and history could be made intelligible while remaining rigorous. Explanation, when offered with care, became a form of respect.\n\nHere, the tools of the invisible commons reached their most humane expression. The Web provided reach; search made discovery possible; open infrastructure kept costs low. Yet the motive force was the act of explanation itself. The teacher stood alongside the learner, treating the student as a capable mind, and making learning an act of invitation rather than one of ranking, filtering, or exclusion. This restoration of dignity remains one of the most consequential achievements of the digital age.\n\nIt is striking that a platform of this global reach and massive utility was founded on a single voice, repeated patiently thousands of times. Even as the project expanded, it retained this intimacy. While traditional schools carry responsibilities far beyond explanation, Khan proved that the continuity of knowledge operates independently of hierarchy. It advances most reliably where the responsibility for clarity is personal, continuous, and owned by a human voice.\n\nIn the end, his contribution reminds us of a truth often obscured by scale and abstraction: that alongside genius and conscience, civilisation depends upon explanation—offered freely, received humbly, and carried forward, one mind at a time.\n\nWe have traced a lineage defined less by doctrine than by a series of human gestures: restraint at the beginning, discipline in the making, generosity in collaboration, conscience under strain, and patience in explanation. Taken together, they suggest that the digital age grew around a distinct, if quiet, centre.\n\nThat centre resides beyond the reach of institutions, ideologies, or markets. It lives in a set of practices—ways of working, judging, and explaining—through which knowledge is made durable and meaning carried forward. They are largely invisible, easily neglected, yet without them the energy of an age leaves nothing that lasts.\n\nCivilisation, as Clark understood, is defined by what it chooses to preserve. Permanence emerges through restraint; through the refusal to enclose what could be enclosed; through standards maintained without command; through explanations offered again, for the sake of someone still learning. Far from the habits of conquest, these are the gestures by which civilisation endures.\n\nYet they remain fragile. Tools may embody values, yet judgment cannot be automated. Institutions can preserve order, yet adaptation lags behind change. Genius may illuminate a path, yet sympathy and proportion determine how far that path can be followed. Again and again, endurance depends less on intelligence than on moral habit.\n\nThe digital world now shapes how we learn, how we work, how we remember, and how we judge one another. Whether it will lift civilisation — or merely accelerate it — remains an open question. The answer lies in the care with which these systems are used, extended, and restrained.\n\nCivilisation has always been a provisional achievement. It must be built, maintained, and renewed by each generation. The invisible commons will endure only if it is treated as a trust.\n\nAnd that, perhaps, is the measure of our moment: not whether we can build systems of astonishing complexity, but whether we can give them the forms, the sympathy, and the permanence required to make them worthy of civilisation itself.",

Given the fact that star Celtics forward Jaylen Brown has been playing at the level of a bona fide Most Valuable Player candidate so far this season and that Boston has defied the odds alongside him to claw their way up to the Eastern Conference's third-place spot, there is a very strong case that they ought to be on the hunt for some talent to add to the roster.\n\nThe frontcourt stands out in particular as an area of need, with the Celtics needing a little bit of veteran experience and a different style of big man play to put next to blossoming young big man Neemias Queta.

The original Code Vein was a solid first effort, but Code Vein II shows that the franchise may have, pardon the pun, cracked the code.\nCode Vein II\nA new code\nCode Vein II takes place in a world on the edge of ruin, and where humans and Revenants, a human-like species of beings with vampiric abilities, live amongst one another.",

    "fullText": "It's a new year! And at Business Insider, we're already diving in.\n\nWe've always been the place for innovators, and AI's arrival is creating a renaissance for entrepreneurs of all stripes. It's led to whole new industries — from legal AI to chatbot training to vibe coding to the data center boom. Everyone is learning as they go, and we are here to help you generate ideas, trade notes, and get smarter. We'll chronicle highs and lows — there will for sure be both.\n\nAt larger firms, leaders will be sizing up which AI experiments are working, at what costs, and with what benefits. How fast AI helps companies' bottom lines will determine whether we're in bubble times in the markets. We're all over that in our new First Trade newsletter.\n\nAI is a big story line on Wall Street, but it's not the only one. This past year showed dents in basic assumptions about capitalism in the US — principles that have underscored the \"stocks for the long run\" thinking that has proven sound for investors. International markets are getting more of a look, especially with rearmament in Europe and AI as a global tailwind.\n\nBetween Washington's investments in business, Zohran Mamdani's rise in the nation's financial capital, and surveys showing eroding confidence in capitalism, that mindset is no longer the given it once was. We are launching a series this week, \"The Future of Capitalism,\" and what it means for your work and wealth. Take our survey, and watch Monday for our first piece!\n\nMeanwhile, in workplaces, capitalism is alive and well. The \"anti-woke workplace\" is increasingly in fashion, and we will help you navigate an era in which many managers, in a sharp shift, are more focused on employee performance than employee policies.\n\nOur obsession with side hustles is still a full-time job for us, whether your thing is real estate, brand influencing, Uber driving, or renting your clothing. And as our reporting showed this past year, a strong side hustle can not only be fun, but also crucial if white-collar layoffs snag you.\n\nSpeaking about clothing, you've made clear you care about how to show up to succeed at work. We're exploring the cost of that, and whether that cost is sometimes too high — for your wallet or your heart. We've also got you covered on style and status, from show-off golf shirts and luxury handbags to viral hoodies, coveted watches, and Wall Street's favorite $1,100 shoes.\n\nAll of which is to say, we're pumped to cover all that's ahead — in words, video, audio, newsletters, online and IRL events, and every way that works for you!

    "description": "Despite the promise of alleviating the main memory bottleneck, and the existence of commercial hardware implementations, techniques for Near-Data Processing have seen relatively little real-world deployment. The idea has received renewed interest with the appearance of disaggregated or \"far\" memory, for example in the use of CXL memory pools.\n  However, we argue that the lack of a clear OS-centric abstraction of Near-Data Processing is a major barrier to adoption of the technology. Inspired by the channel controllers which interface the CPU to disk drives in mainframe systems, we propose memory channel controllers as a convenient, portable, and virtualizable abstraction of Near-Data Processing for modern disaggregated memory systems.\n  In addition to providing a clean abstraction that enables OS integration while requiring no changes to CPU architecture, memory channel controllers incorporate another key innovation: they exploit the cache coherence provided by emerging interconnects to provide a much richer programming model, with more fine-grained interaction, than has been possible with existing designs.",

    "description": "Jalen Suggs has worn his headband on his neck in a peculiar fashion choice. The NBA isn't happy.",
    "fullText": "Orlando Magic guard Jalen Suggs has made the unusual fashion choice of wearing his headband around his neck this season. It's a nod to his \"football drip\" from high school, Suggs explains, as he was a prized quarterback who held a scholarship offer from SEC powerhouse Georgia before taking the basketball path at Gonzaga.\n\nWhether you like the headband-on-neck look or not, the NBA has taken it away. The Magic broadcast revealed Friday that Suggs has been banned from styling his headband the way he has been. It harkens back to when the NBA banned players from wearing double headbands after Tim Thomas briefly tried to popularize the trend while playing for the Milwaukee Bucks in 2002.\n\nIt's worth noting Suggs never wore the headband around his neck for the entire game. He'd play the first few minutes with it there before transferring the headband to its standard position around his forehead.\n\nKendra Douglas mentions that the league told Jalen Suggs that the headband must be on his head to begin basketball games pic.twitter.com/ap3UqPKyKf\n\n— The Magic Way (@MagicFilmRoom) January 3, 2026\n\nJalen Suggs getting the “neck headband” banned by the NBA reminds me of when Tim Thomas got the “double headband” banned in 2002 pic.twitter.com/y28I07W26R\n\n— Average Basketball Players (@avgbballplayers) January 3, 2026\n\nSuggs is averaging 15 points, 4.7 assists and 3.7 assists this season. He's an excellent perimeter defender with 1.9 steals per game. The former No. 5 overall pick has missed time with a hip contusion and knee strain, however, prompting concern considering he's only played more than 53 games once across his first four NBA seasons.\n\nOrlando will hope to have Suggs healthy and as tenacious as ever for the playoffs, though he won't have his signature look.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Is Magic star Jalen Suggs banned from wearing headband on his neck?",

    "description": "A Blackberry style companion device for all your messaging needs.",
    "fullText": "Clicks, the company behind those physical keyboard cases for your smartphone, has announced a new device, but it'll look pretty familiar to anyone who's used a Blackberry before. It's called the Clicks Communicator, and it's a pocketable little handset that's perfect for anyone who misses having physical buttons on their phone. It comes with a full, old-school style QWERTY keyboard and runs Android 16, and while you can pump it full of apps and use it standalone, Clicks says it expects many of its customers will prefer to use it as a minimalistic companion to a primary smartphone. In that way, this device is designed to be your secondary smartphone, where you only load it with the apps you need at a moments notice and use it to quickly reply to your messages, emails, and other important notifications.\n\nOne of the headlining features of the Clicks Communicator is the Signal LED, which is a notification light around the side button. You can set it to light up with a different color based on who's pinged you or which apps are sending you notifications, so you can know what needs your attention first without having to scroll through a long series of notification boxes. For instance, you could set up a green LED for notifications from people you care about, and use other colors for different apps. I'm not entirely sure how this'll play out in practice, because I do worry that I'll forget which color is for what after a point. Fortunately, Clicks says you can also turn off the Signal LED if it's not useful for you (and yes, there will still be traditional notification boxes if you need them).\n\nAs for the core experience, in line with its design philosophy, the company has chosen not to show you an app grid when you go to the home screen. In collaboration with Niagara Launcher, Click has instead built a messaging hub, which shows you all your pending alerts on the home screen, grouped by app. You can use the keyboard to triage these messages or to reply to individual chats, the company says.\n\nThere's also a lot of emphasis on the keyboard, as is expected from a company that went viral by launching a physical keyboard case for touchscreen phones. Clicks says the keys on the Communicator are bigger and better than those on its keyboard case. There's a red Clicks key on the keypad, which you can use to launch custom shortcuts. The Spacebar has a built-in fingerprint sensor, which could be handy for unlocking the phone quickly. The keypad is touch-sensitive, which means that you can slide your fingers over it to scroll through messages. And before you ask, yes, it also has a 4.03-inch OLED touchscreen display for those of us who like scrolling on a smoother surface.\n\nSome of you may also be pleased to know that the Clicks Communicator has a 3.5mm headphone jack and that it supports microSD cards for storage expansion. It ships with 256GB storage and you can add a microSD card with up to 2TB of capacity.\n\nThe device runs Android 16, supports Qi2 wireless charging, has a USB-C port, and has a 50-MP rear camera with optical image stabilization, alongside a 24-MP front camera. It's powered by a 4nm MediaTek chip that has 5G support. It's a dual-SIM phone with one physical SIM slot and an eSIM, so you could use it on its own instead of as the \"complementary product\" its pitched as, but taking calls or using certain apps could be tricky on such a small device.\n\nIf you want a Clicks Communicator, you can reserve one now for $399 + $30 for shipping and duties. The launch price is expected to be $499, which means that pre-orders get a $100 discount. The device also has swappable back covers, and the company is offering two back covers for free with pre-orders.\n\nFor everyone that just wants to add physical keys to their existing phone, Clicks has also launched a magnetic wireless power bank with a built-in sliding physical keyboard. This is one of the more quirky products I've seen from this year's pre-CES announcements, but it could make for a great middle ground for everyone who doesn't want the Communicator.\n\nI wasn't a big fan of wired power banks back in the day, but the advent of magnetic wireless charging has changed that, and now I'm itching to slap one onto my iPhone. Throwing a slide-out Bluetooth keyboard into the mix just sweetens the pot, even if it is a bit of a heavy package overall, at 180g. And because of that wireless Bluetooth connection, you can also use the keyboard with your phone, tablet, TV, or gaming console, if you like. The charger doesn't need to be physically attached to a device for its keyboard to work with it, and the device as a whole works with both Apple and Android.\n\nThere is a downside, though. The Clicks Power Keyboard has a 2,150mAh battery, and it only supports 5W Qi wireless charging. That's a very slow charger by today's standards, but the good news is that your smartphone is less likely to overheat with those charging speeds. It's priced at $80 for pre-orders and is expected to start shipping this Spring.\n\nFor a comparison, you could get an Anker wireless power bank for around $55. This one weighs 4.3oz (120g), offers faster 15W charging, and has a higher battery capacity (5,000mAh). You don't get a physical keyboard with most power banks in the market, so Clicks is banking on that to power sales of its Power Keyboard.",

    "fullText": "The imminent 130th anniversary of the Louis Vuitton monogram is less a birthday and more a demonstration of how powerful two letters can be.\n\nBorn in 1896, when the Époque was at its most Belle, the superposed initials LV appeared amidst a variety of foliate and geometrical motifs. At first it was not a success. “The public was initially reticent and demanded the chequered and even the striped canvas, but my father stood firm,” recalled Gaston-Louis Vuitton of his father Georges Vuitton, son of the founder.\n\nThe striped and chequered patterns he mentions refer to previous designs. Every decade or so, Vuitton changed the pattern of the canvas with which it covered its famous, flat-topped trunks. Trianon grey came first in 1858. In 1872, the grey gave way to stripes. The checkerboard Damier pattern came in 1888, and was the first time that the maker’s name appeared on luggage, with the words “Marque L Vuitton Déposée” (which translate as “L Vuitton registered trademark”) appearing every so often in the checks.\n\nThe Damier was intended to scare off counterfeiters. It didn’t work — which leads us to the monogram we know today. If Georges thought that this new design would deter the fakers, a summer stroll along a 21st-century Mediterranean beach, with its itinerant vendors of imposter Louis Vuitton bags, shows just how comprehensively he failed.\n\nGeorges Vuitton had inadvertently created one of, if not the, most recognisable hieroglyphs in the history of luxury goods. This was not branding as we know it today; it was more akin to an artist signing a canvas. As well as a hint of the Japonisme, the mania for all things Japanese that gripped France in the late 19th century, the geometric emblems attested to Georges Vuitton’s fascination with the ogives and spandrels of Gothic architecture. In particular, he was a great admirer of the work of Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, the French architect who revolutionised the study and restoration of medieval architecture.\n\nViollet-le-Duc’s reputation may since have faded, but the patterned monogram is known in every corner of the globe. This January, the house will embark on a year-long celebration with the familiar dramatis personae taking to the stage: the Speedy of 1930; the Keepall, also from 1930; the Noé, made for a champagne producer in 1932 to carry five bottles (four upright and the fifth inverted); the Alma, Parisian architecture translated into handbag in 1992; and, finally, the Neverfull of 2007 — capable, so Vuitton says, of carrying up to 100 kilogrammes but more usually functioning as a capacious tote.\n\nThe bags will appear in different guises throughout the anniversary year. Most striking of the three celebratory capsules is Monogram Origine, a collection of the classics (minus, for some reason, the Keepall), that returns to Georges’s first pattern but deploys a newly developed coated linen/cotton canvas that comes in its recognisable chocolate-brown Ebène shade as well as a soft rainbow of pastels. All of which provide further proof, if further proof were needed, that at 130 years of age, the famous monogram is as versatile as it is well known.",

    "description": "Ohio State was a heavy favorite against Miami in the CFP Cotton Bowl but lost in a distressed fashion. Here are five things we learned.",
    "fullText": "Ohio State came into the College Football Playoff as the odds-on favorite to win it all. In the end, it couldn't even get past its first game against a Miami team that looked more prepared and energized. In the end, the Buckeyes played too flat in the first half and couldn't dig themselves out of the hole with a better second half being too little, too late against a very good defense.\n\nWe were on site for the game in AT&T Stadium and now have time to reflect on what went wrong against a team that Ohio State was better than all year, and should have been able to get past to try and defend its national championship.\n\nBut now the season is over, and we're here to give you five things we think we learned after the depressing result against Miami in the Cotton Bowl Classic.\n\nIt was 23 years in waiting. I don't know what else is needed for motivation, but it was clear that the Hurricanes had more energy and purpose than what we saw from Ohio State. Nobody wants to hear that, especially the OSU coaches, but the Buckeyes are the better team, and that comes down to heart and wanting it more.\n\nYou'll hear the coaches and players point to execution, but at the heart of execution is having the motivation and fury to get the job done. The more aggressive team won tonight, and now the Buckeyes sesason is over, and it's time to take stock in how these games don't happen in the future.\n\nOhio state played no one this year and when they had to they got beat https://t.co/XPGp10RPwg\n\n— #SKOLONG (@golongbuffs) January 1, 2026\n\nOhio State is good. Really good. But there were really only a couple of teams that could match up with what the Buckeyes had personnel-wise. At the end of the day, OSU lost two out of three of those games (Texas, Indiana, Miami).\n\nLet's call it what it is now at the end of the season. The Buckeyes looked like world-beaters against teams that had no shot at competing, but in matchup games, it fell flat. That's something that has to be looked at, and it won't get any easier in this new age of the 12-team (soon to be expanded) College Football Playoff. You can't just win a couple of games and then catch lightning in a bottle. The program was able to get to the right level last year, but not this time.\n\nIt just looks like Ohio State peaked early and over-performed most of the season. They started to look a little weaker in November.\n\n— Orange_Bat (@The_Orange_Bat) January 1, 2026\n\nLast year, after the 13-10 loss to Michigan, Ohio State played with its hair on fire and got better and better each week all the way to a CFP national championship. The team peaked at just the right time to build through the playoff and win the whole thing.\n\nThis season, it sure feels like the Buckeyes peaked midseason, or maybe at the Michigan game, but then seemed to digress. It lost to Indiana because of poor execution and energy, and the same happened against Miami here in Dallas. It's a hard thing to bottle and get just right, but to win a national championship, you have to peak at the right time, and this team simply did not do it.\n\nThe final stats look good, yes. The Buckeyes gave up 291 yards, and only 138 through the air, but that doesn't tell the whole story. Even though Mark Fletcher didn't quite reach 100 yards on the ground, the Hurricanes were able to put together very long drives and frustrate the Ohio State sideline. A lot of that had to do with not being able to get off the field on third downs. Miami converted 7-of-14 third downs, and that allowed it to win the time of possession.\n\nAnd, with the game on the line and OSU down by three points, the Ohio State defense couldn't get the 'Canes off the field, and let them go on a touchdown-sealing drive to put this thing away. As good as the defense has looked all year, if you have a championship defense, you get a stop there and give your offense a chance. That didn't happen, and here we are.\n\nDespite the defense not playing up to its standard, the games Ohio State lost this year have more to do with an inability to do enough on the offensive end. The Buckeyes almost lost to Texas by scoring just 14 points, and we can excuse that away as first-game issues, but then they only scored 10 points against Indiana in a loss, and then 14 tonight against Miami.\n\nThere's something wrong with the operation of the offense when you have guys like Jeremiah Smith, Carnell Tate, Bo Jackson, Max Klare, and more, if you can't put up more points against even the best defenses. Look no further than the offensive line in the two losses as the thing the coaching staff will need to put their thumb on, because a rushed offense and quarterback is a very inefficient one, no matter who you have in the mask and cape.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Buckeyes Wire: Ohio State vs. Miami: 5 things we learned from the Cotton Bowl loss",

    "fullText": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (STAMPEDE) — The Sioux Falls Stampede kicked off the New Year in dominant fashion, earning a 6–1 victory over the Omaha Lancers. The Herd saw goals from Brent Solomon, Anthony Bongo, Ryder Betzold, Cooper Soller, Thomas Zocco, and Logan Renkowski, while goaltender Linards Feldbergs continued his strong play between the pipes.\n\nThe first period began at a slower pace, but momentum quickly shifted after Brent Solomon opened the scoring with a one-timer that beat Lancers goaltender Devin Shakar stick side. Shortly after, Anthony Bongo found the back of the net with a shot from his knees, assisted by Jack Brauti and Solomon.\n\nAt 9:42, Omaha took its first penalty of the night on a tripping call. With just one second remaining on the power play, Ryder Betzold buried a shot from the low slot to extend the Herd’s lead, with an assist from JJ Monteiro.\n\nAt 13:05, the puck became tangled in front of the net, leading to a stoppage in play. After a successful Stampede challenge, the goal was awarded to Cooper Soller, assisted by Juho Keinanen. Omaha challenged the play for goaltender interference, but after review, the call stood. Shortly after, Soller was whistled for goalie interference, but the Herd successfully killed the penalty.\n\nThe Stampede closed out the period strong when Thomas Zocco carried the puck the length of the ice and scored off the crossbar at 18:21, giving Sioux Falls a commanding lead heading into the first intermission.\n\nThe second period got underway with an early power-play opportunity for the Herd at 3:22, but they were unable to convert. Soon after, Sioux Falls earned another power play, and Logan Renkowski capitalized, finishing on a wide-open net after the Omaha goaltender was knocked out of the crease. Assists on the goal went to Brent Solomon and Thomas Zocco.\n\nThe Lancers got on the board at 8:12 with their lone goal of the night. Tensions rose later in the period as Logan Renkowski and Charlie Vig received matching roughing penalties.\n\nScoring slowed in the third period, but physical play and penalties picked up significantly. The Herd was called for their first penalty of the period just 11 seconds in. At 3:12, a scrum broke out, resulting in Jack Brauti receiving a double minor for roughing, George Lovell being assessed a minor for roughing, and Charlie Vig picking up a total of 24 penalty minutes for various infractions. Despite earning a power play, the Stampede were unable to add to their total.\n\nThe physicality continued at 5:53 when Wade Weil received a minor for unsportsmanlike conduct, followed by a slashing penalty to Omaha’s Ryan Reynolds. Shortly after, Joe McGraw was sent off for high-sticking, and the Lancers took three additional penalties over the remainder of the period.\n\nSioux Falls outshot Omaha 44–30 on the night. Feldbergs stopped 29 shots, improving his record to 15-7-1-0 while posting a .914 save percentage and a 2.43 goals-against average.\n\nThe Herd will travel to Des Moines for a matchup against the Buccaneers on Friday before returning home to the Denny Sanford PREMIER Center to face the Omaha Lancers once again. Fans can look forward to Hockey Day presented by Lift Pro Equipment, where the first 1,000 fans will receive a Stampede bucket hat.",

    "description": "In 2025, we saw plenty of fashion missteps at major red-carpet events, from the Oscars and the Met Gala to the Cannes Film Festival.",
    "fullText": "We need to talk about the red-carpet duds of 2025.\n\nSure, there were many standout fashion moments throughout the year, like Zendaya at the Golden Globes. Still, there were just as many fashion mistakes made at major events.\n\nJamie Lee Curtis, for example, pushed feathers to their limit at the SAG Awards, and Alexander Skarsgård wore a truly ridiculous pair of boots in Cannes. Then, Kim Kardashian went incognito at the Academy Museum Gala.\n\nSadly, they're not alone. Here's a look at those outfits and other style moments that disappointed in 2025.\n\nShe walked the Golden Globes red carpet on January 5 in a hot-pink jumpsuit with long sleeves. It also had a V-shaped neckline, a thick waist panel, and wide-leg pants. The actor sported a massive ruffled cape on top.\n\nMcCarthy was overwhelmed by the Christian Siriano look. A simpler gown in a lighter shade of pink would have suited her much better.\n\nUnfortunately, she was one of the stars who missed the mark with her fashion at the February 23 event. Her feathered top was so thick that it covered her entire neck and created an unflattering silhouette.\n\nHer Dolce & Gabbana dress was much better, with a form-fitting shape and all-over sparkles. Still, the outerwear distracted from her gown.\n\nThe musician walked the Oscars red carpet on March 2 in a custom Ralph Lauren ball gown. Though it had some potential, its various features ultimately clashed and created a messy look.\n\nIts sparkling, strapless top would have suited a prom dress, while its full skirt with a raw hem looked messy and incomplete. Her brown belt also looked much more casual than her layered diamond necklaces.\n\nHis black catsuit featured floor-length trousers, a loose-fitting top that covered half his torso, and a neckline that extended into a scarf wrapped around the bottom of his face.\n\nThe outfit fit him poorly, looked a bit odd, and landed him on the night's worst-dressed list.\n\nLatex had a moment in the late 2010s, but it's long passed. So it was confusing to see Lively in a tan-colored dress made from the stretchy material at the premiere of \"Another Simple Favor.\"\n\nThe Renée Masoomian garment was strapless with a structured bodice and a lace-embellished skirt. It also featured a latex overcoat that Lively wore at the start of her appearance.\n\nShe arrived at the Breakthrough Prize ceremony in a sequinned Gaurav Gupta gown.\n\nThough the color and sparkling material suited the musician, its shape and accessories did not.\n\nThe visible mesh that held its bodice together distracted from its unique shape, and its matching headpiece appeared too tight to fit Perry comfortably.\n\nFor the Time 100 Gala on April 24, Sheeran sported a Tom Ford suit that was tailored perfectly.\n\nBut its pale-pink color washed him out, and the white T-shirt he wore beneath his blazer was too bland. A darker fabric could have improved his suit, especially if paired with a button-down top.\n\nShe attended the event on May 8 in a black one-piece from Monse. The sleeveless garment had a leather bodice and wide-leg trousers with an asymmetrical skirt draped on top.\n\nThe outfit was cool, but it wasn't accessorized to its full potential. It would've been fun to see Kidman wear it with an updo hairstyle, smoky eye makeup, and a bit of silver jewelry.\n\nWitzøe might've been one of the few billionaires at the 2025 Met Gala, but he was also one of the worst-dressed.\n\nThe Norwegian billionaire wore a white suit from Todd Patrick, an overcoat seemingly made from latex, multiple necklaces, a wide-brimmed hat, and Tabi boots.\n\nHe also carried a see-through briefcase filled with vibrant red roses, which made the outfit look more like a costume.\n\nSaint Laurent custom-made her black blazer dress, which she wore with sheer tights and diamond jewelry.\n\nThe glamour of those accessories clashed strongly with her edgy choice of shoes: a pair of platform open-toed heels.\n\nOverall, though, the outfit was too plain and didn't match the night's theme, which honored Black dandyism and menswear.\n\nHe was photographed on the Cannes red carpet wearing a Saint Laurent tux and his trousers tucked into thigh-high leather boots.\n\nThe fashion house first unveiled the shoe style during its January runway show, where the design looked somewhat interesting. On a red carpet, though, they mostly looked ridiculous.\n\nThe Blonds designed her royal blue ensemble, which was strapless and covered in silver sparkles. It had a structured bodice, a sharp neckline, and long pants with flame-like fringe at the ankles.\n\nThe top half of the outfit had potential and would have worked if paired with a miniskirt. As a catsuit, though, the outfit looked more like a costume.\n\nShe walked the event's red carpet in a shapeless, colorless gown from Prada. It had a high neckline, long sleeves, and a flowing skirt that revealed her silver platform sandals.\n\nThe outfit was forgettable and could have been improved with silver jewelry and an updo hairstyle.\n\nShe wore a beige jumpsuit that was covered in transparent sequins and embellished with cutouts. It had a scarf neckline, one off-the-shoulder sleeve, and skinny pants.\n\nUnfortunately, the garment wasn't tight enough to be form-fitting, nor loose enough to fit oversized. Its neutral color was also too light to make a statement.\n\nSimone Rocha designed her eye-catching set, which featured wide-legged trousers worn beneath a sleeveless, sparkling gown.\n\nThe top half of her outfit would have looked chic if worn on its own. But when paired with pants, the style overpowered the actor.\n\nShe wore a tan look from Maison Margiela, which was just a touch lighter in shade than her skintone, and a stack of diamond and emerald necklaces wrapped around her neck.\n\nThe strapless gown, with its arm bands and light ruching, looked elegant on the billionaire. However, she also wore a tan hood that covered her face, which looked more silly than serious.\n\nShe wore a long-sleeved, V-neck gown from Gucci in a striking green color. It was covered in sequins and contrasted her dark hair beautifully.\n\nHowever, her accessories didn't work with the dress. She carried a small black purse and wore a statement necklace made from rubies and diamonds.\n\nThe two pieces clashed and distracted from the elegant gown.\n\nThe country star hosted the annual event, making numerous outfit changes throughout the night.\n\nOne of those included a long-sleeved, camouflage dress with a floor-length skirt, a long brown belt, leather gloves, and a cowboy hat.\n\nThe outfit's country vibes were strong, but it fell short of glamorous and was definitely not her best look during the CMA Awards.",

    "fullText": "More than a year after his last Major League game, former Boston Red Sox pitcher Joe Kelly is calling it a career.\n\nKelly essentially announced his retirement on the “Baseball Isn’t Boring” podcast, saying he’s no longer pitching. True to form, he refused to explicitly say he’s retiring, taking exception to the phrase.\n\n“Retiring is, like, something my grandmother did,” Kelly said. “It’s so disrespectful. I’m sorry all you people out there that work a real job. You guys deserve to retire. Athletes don’t. We just stop (expletive) playing…No more retirement (expletive).”\n\nKelly last pitched in 2024 for the Los Angeles Dodgers, earning his third World Series ring. After going unsigned in 2025, the 37-year-old right-hander is hanging it up.\n\nHis eventful MLB career spanned 13 seasons from 2012 to 2024. He pitched for four teams and won three championships along the way, primarily as a reliever.\n\nAfter beginning his career with the St. Louis Cardinals, Kelly spent four and a half seasons with the Red Sox from 2014 to 2018. He initially struggled as a starter but had more success after moving to the bullpen, leading the 2018 World Series champs with 73 relief appearances.\n\nKelly flourished during that playoff run, allowing just one earned run with 13 strikeouts over 11 1/3 postseason innings. He always saved his best for October, posting a 0.51 ERA in the playoffs with Boston.\n\nHe joined the Dodgers after pitching against them in the 2018 Fall Classic, helping them win titles in 2020 and 2024.\n\nTalkative, combative and armed with a good fastball, Kelly had a reputation for getting under opponents’ skin and occasionally starting brawls. He was a character who stood out from the crowd with his unique personality and presence, making him one of the more memorable relievers in recent Red Sox history.\n\nRed Sox Should Sign Veteran Southpaw After Short Stint With Cubs",

    "title": "Meet Lululemon founder Chip Wilson, who just launched a proxy fight to shake up the athleisure giant's board",
    "description": "Chip Wilson founded Lululemon in 1997 after selling his first apparel company. He became known for his controversial remarks and mishandling of company scandals.",
    "fullText": "Lululemon's billionaire founder, Chip Wilson, has been the center of both acclaim and controversy.\n\nThe 70-year-old entrepreneur was at the forefront of the movement that turned women's activewear into everyday apparel. The booming athleisure market is estimated to reach $623 billion by 2030, according to a November 2025 report. And Lululemon is a big part of that market. Popular items, like the brand's leggings, develop cult followings and become status symbols among certain demographics, like Gen Z.\n\nBut Wilson has also been a poster child for corporate controversy. Over the years, his comments about women's bodies, child labor, and the Asian community sparked outrage and eventually led to his ouster.\n\nAfter being heavily involved with the brand for over 15 years, Wilson resigned from the board of directors in 2015. Despite his exit, he's been vocal about the company's performance in recent years, frequently calling it out for underperforming compared to newer competitors. In December, he launched a proxy fight by nominating three new independent board members.\n\nToday, Wilson is worth about $7.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and is often among the top 10 wealthiest Canadians. He spends part of his fortune on philanthropy and researching a cure for the rare muscular disease called facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, which he was diagnosed with at 32 years old.\n\nHere's everything we know about Wilson's life and career as the founder and former CEO of Lululemon.\n\nWilson lived in California up until the age of five when his family moved to Calgary. He relocated to Edmonton for university in 1973 before moving back to the US for work two years later, according to his website.\n\nHe lived in Alaska and worked on an oil pipeline in 1975. During this time, Wilson said he read the top 100 books of all time.\n\n\"By the age of 19, I might have been the wealthiest, most traveled and best-read boy in the world,\" Wilson wrote on his website.\n\nHe went on to become an economist after receiving his degree in economics from the University of Calgary in 1979.\n\nHis entrepreneurial streak began in 1979 with Westbeach Surf Company. He started making shorts inspired by those he saw on a trip to California in 1979, Wilson writes in his book, \"The Story of Lululemon.\"\n\n\"The mistake that led to my success was an inability to sell my long, baggy, wild-patterned shorts to wholesalers. Consequently, I was forced to open my own store,\" he writes on his website.\n\nHe opened his own stores and owned the manufacturing — a move that he said tripled profits, he writes\n\nOver the years, his company evolved to serve different types of athletic lifestyles, like skateboarding and snowboarding. In 1997, Wilson sold Westbeach.\n\nWilson led an active lifestyle growing up. He played football, wrestled in university, and completed an Ironman triathlon in 1983, according to his website.\n\nFour years later, he was diagnosed with the rare, slow atrophying muscular dystrophy. As a result Wilson said he dedicates \"considerable time and money into discovering a cure.\"\n\nThe first Lululemon store opened in 2000 in Vancouver, Forbes reported. Wilson is often credited with creating and normalizing athleisure for everyday wear rather than just for workouts.\n\nWilson once said he named the company Lululemon because he believed Japanese people can't pronounce the letter L.\n\n\"It's funny to watch them try and say it,\" Wilson told Canada's The Tyee in 2005.\n\nHe has also said that brand names with the letter L in them are considered more authentic to Japanese consumers.\n\nHis now-wife, Summer Wilson, started as the founding lead designer for the brand, according to her website.\n\nWilson and Summer wed in 2002, according to his site. He had two sons from a previous marriage, and he and Summer eventually welcomed three more.\n\nThe couple live in Vancouver where Wilson has permanently lived since 1986, per his website.\n\nAfter taking the company public, Wilson took the role of chief innovation and branding officer. His CEO successor was former Starbucks executive Christine Day. The pair clashed often.\n\nIn January 2012, Lululemon announced that Wilson would step down from his role as chief innovation and branding officer. His vision for the brand's direction was a source of friction between him and former CEO Day.\n\nFollowing his resignation, Wilson began a sabbatical in Australia for over a year before Lululemon called him back to help handle a crisis, according to a 2015 press release.\n\nWomen, children, and minorities have been the subject of Wilson's most offensive takes over the years. Most of which he's had to later clarify or apologize for.\n\nThe lululemon founder once blamed birth control for higher divorce rates since \"Men did not know how to relate to the new female.\" Wilson has also spoken in favor of children working in factories to earn money and avoid poverty.\n\n\"The single easiest way to spread wealth around the world is to have poor countries pull themselves out of poverty,\" Wilson told The Tyee.\n\nAmid tension with Day and a year of scandals for Lululemon, Wilson stepped down from his role as chairman of the board in 2013.\n\nIn his book, titled \"Little Black Stretchy Pants,\" Wilson said he made Day cry during a 2013 meeting when he called her a terrible CEO and questioned her vision for Lululemon. Wilson wrote that he suspected her reaction was fake, and Day announced her resignation one day later.\n\nOn his website, Wilson said he had his own reason for leaving the company.\n\n\"I lost control of the culture and product development,\" Wilson wrote. \"At odds with a board of directors who did not want to invest in the future, I departed in 2013.\"\n\nIn the deal, Wilson sold half of his shares in the company to investment firm Advent International for $845 million, Inc. reported. Today, Wilson owns an 8% stake in Lululemon, according to Bloomberg.\n\nIn 2019, Wilson invested $100 million in the Chinese activewear company for a 0.6% stake, Forbes reported. Anta owns a majority stake in Amer Sports, a conglomerate of brands which includes Arc'teryx and Wilson Sports. Wilson said in an interview that he owns a 20% stake in Amer.\n\nWilson's 8% stake in Lululemon makes up a major portion of his wealth, per Bloomberg. Lululemon reported revenue of $10.6 billion in the last fiscal year, which ended in February 2025.\n\nHis waterfront mansion was valued at ​ $74 million in 2023 and has seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms, according to CBC. The property, which was constructed in 2008, has a pool and tennis court.\n\nLow Tide Properties invests in, develops, and operates commercial and residential buildings in Vancouver, with a focus on building lab and hospital spaces. It also owns multi-family properties in Seattle.\n\nWilson told Real Estate Magazine that started the company with a goal to invest 65% of his family's wealth into real estate in three cities by 2030.\n\nIn 2018, the Wilsons established the Wilson School of Design at Kwantlen Polytechnic University in Richmond, British Columbia. They donated $12 million towards the program and a $36 million new facility on the school's campus.\n\nHe has allocated some of his wealth towards his charities Imagine1Day, which funds schooling for children in Ethiopia, and Wilson 5 Foundation which supports land conservation and public art installations in British Columbia.\n\nWilson's rare muscular disease affects an estimated 900,000 people globally. Wilson has an even less common form known as FSHD2, which affects just 5% of those with the disease, Business Insider reported.\n\nIn 2022, Wilson created his philanthropic venture Solve FSHD and pledged $100 million into finding a cure for FSHD.\n\nOn his website, Wilson wrote, \"I have a great fascination for the subject of longevity as I see aging as a disease.\"\n\nIn his quest to cure FSHD, he has experimented with longevity and wellness treatments popular among wealthy entrepreneurs trying to prevent aging. Some of his methods include hormone therapy, electroacupuncture, and daily doses of the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin, according to Bloomberg.\n\nWilson told Forbes in an interview published in January 2024 that he doesn't agree with the \"whole diversity and inclusion thing\" that Lululemon has embraced.\n\n\"They're trying to become like the Gap, everything to everybody. And I think the definition of a brand is that you're not everything to everybody,\" Wilson said.\n\n\"You've got to be clear that you don't want certain customers coming in,\" he added.\n\nWilson has had some choice words for Lululemon's leadership over the years as the brand loses ground to brands like Alo Yoga and Vuori. In October 2025, he compared the mistakes that the brand has made to a plane crash. He also doesn't appear to be a fan of CEO Calvin McDonald, who is set to exit the company in 2026.\n\nHe blamed the brand's \"loss of cool\" on McDonald and his team for losing its innovative edge, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nAlthough Wilson hasn't held a management position at Lululemon in over a decade, he's still voicing his strong opinions on how the company should be run. After Lululemon named CFO Meghan Frank and chief commercial officer André Maestrini as co-interim CEOs earlier in December, Wilson said the CEO succession plan was a \"total failure of board oversight.\"\n\n\"Shareholders have no faith that this board can select and support the next CEO without input from a board with stronger product experience,\" Wilson said in a public statement.\n\nOn December 29, he confirmed that he has nominated three inependent director candidates to the company's board, effectively launching a proxy fight at the athleisure brand. His nominations include former On Running co-CEO Marc Maurer, former ESPN chief marketing officer Laura Gentile, and former Activision CEO Eric Hirshberg.\n\n\"They can play an essential role in refocusing on the inspirational customer, revitalizing its bold vision, attracting the best people and maximizing value for all shareholders,\" Wilson said.",

    "fullText": "At some point, sneakers, which used to be solely about athletic performance, crossed over into fashion.\n\nBefore his wedding, my brother actually told me that he had to tell his friends they could not wear Jordans with their Hugo Boss tuxedos. Being a little older than the rest of the wedding party, it never occurred to me that sneakers had become so fashionable that some people would wear them in a situation that calls for dress shoes.\n\nClearly, sneakers have crossed over culturally, with certain models now functioning as luxury items, despite their athletic roots. That shift helps explain why the resale market has grown so rapidly and why collectors are willing to pay premium prices.\n\n“What began as a niche culture among sneakerheads has now become part of everyday fashion. Sneakers have evolved into investment pieces, with some models seeing enormous value increases,” Vinted Senior Brand Expert Jens Kuhlmann told AIM Group for its report, \"Running up a $30 billion business: How sneaker resale has gone global.\"\n\nSneakers have also become an investment.\n\n“The unregulated aftermarket or resale market for sneakers and streetwear is scaling at a rapid growth rate, fueled by lean inventory from major sneaker brands (e.g., Nike), consistent drops of new releases, deep sneaker archives from which to draw for future releases, an endless aisle, a community of like-minded enthusiasts, and digital marketplaces that offer transparency and ease of use,” according to Cowen's Sneakers As An Alternative Asset Class.\n\nThat has created a market and launched a number of retailers that specialize in selling and reselling sneakers. One of those chains, Soleply, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier this year and has since closed four of its six stores.\n\nSoleply filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March after taking on too much debt and unsustainable leases, according to court documents filed with PacerMonitor.\n\nThe sneaker reseller noted in its bankruptcy filing that the move is due to “financial distress” largely driven by \"high-interest, short-term debt used to fund store expansions, which created a cycle of inventory shortages and cash flow instability that ultimately proved unsustainable,\" WWD.com reported.\n\nThe retail chain sells streetwear and sneakers from brands including Asics, Nike, Jordan, and New Balance. It shared in its filing that while each store was initially profitable, the burden of debt repayment soon began to take its toll.\n\n“Cash flow constraints forced Soleply to divert substantial revenue toward loan payments, leaving insufficient capital to maintain adequate inventory levels,” the filing said. “As a result, some stores struggled to sustain the same level of sales, and the company faced mounting financial challenges.”",

    "fullText": "Love it or loathe it, the Battle of the Sexes-style event between Aryna Sabalenka and Nick Kyrgios has caused quite the stir.\n\nSabalenka, the women's world number one, faces 2022 Wimbledon finalist Kyrgios in an exhibition match on 28 December.\n\nThe event will be shown live on BBC One from 15:45 GMT.\n\nBBC Sport looks at the key questions going into the divisive match.\n\n'Battle of the Sexes' will not damage women's sport - Sabalenka\n\n'Mine was for social change, this is not' - King on Battle of the Sexes\n\nIf any women's player is going to beat Kyrgios, then you would expect it to be Sabalenka.\n\nThe 27-year-old Belarusian won four titles - including the US Open - and reached five other finals in a productive 2025 season.\n\nSabalenka has been one of the most effective servers this season, sitting in the top five for service games won, and has powerful groundstrokes.\n\nThe four-time major singles champion has the ability to hit through opponents, though she is still prone to being erratic from the baseline.\n\nOver the past season, where she won 59 of her 71 matches, Sabalenka has looked to introduce more variety into her game with drop-shots and coming forward to the net.\n\n\"I feel I will be more prepared than this guy,\" she told BBC Sport.\n\nThe exhibition will be the best of three sets, with a 10 point tie-breaker if it goes to a decider.\n\nAccording to organisers Evolve, data shows women players move about 9% slower on average than men, so the dimensions of Sabalenka's side of the court will be 9% smaller.\n\nEach player will only receive one serve in an attempt to restrict Kyrgios' power and speed advantage. He thinks that is the biggest leveller.\n\n\"You're taking my strength completely out of it,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Obviously she has a great serve herself, but from the back of the court things are a bit more even.\n\n\"The men's game is heavily reliant and dominated by first serve percentage and holding serve quite easy.\n\n\"So if you take that away the game becomes a bit more of a grind from the baseline and I think that slightly goes in her favour.\"\n\nSome see the match as harmless entertainment that will attract a newer, younger audience in the age of social media.\n\nOthers believe it is a misguided venture and, if Sabalenka loses, will create an opportunity for women's tennis to be belittled.\n\n\"I am not putting myself at any risk. We're there to have fun and bring great tennis. Whoever wins, wins,\" she said.\n\n\"It's so obvious that the man is biologically stronger than the woman, but it's not about that.\n\n\"This event is only going to help bring women's tennis to a higher level.\"\n\nCritics have questioned Kyrgios' suitability as the male protagonist, given he admitted assaulting an ex-girlfriend in 2021 and has made a series of comments which have been considered misogynistic.\n\nKyrgios says he has not given \"one thought\" about the event potentially fuelling criticism of women's sport, and insists he is not concerned about losing.\n\n\"I'm never worried. I know how I've responded with things in my life,\" the former world number 13 said.\n\n\"This is all a bonus. I've lost tennis matches before, so it's not really a big deal.\"\n\nWith his booming first serve, easy power from the baseline and creative shot-making, Kyrgios' talent has never been in doubt.\n\nHis temperament has been questioned - as has his fitness in recent years.\n\nKyrgios missed most of the 2023 season and the entire 2024 campaign with a wrist injury that the Australian's surgeon thought would end his career.\n\nThe 30-year-old returned to action at January's Australian Open but has not played an ATP Tour singles match since March because of a knee injury.\n\n\"In the past year I've had to have some serious conversations with myself about how much I want to dedicate myself,\" he said.\n\n\"I was asking myself if I really wanted to put myself in a pressure cooker – every time I go out there is a lot of expectation.\n\n\"But I feel great. Now I'm in my 30s, I have to start looking after my body a little better.\n\n\"I know if I can play best of three with a tie-break that's a long way from where I was a year and a half ago.\"\n\nCynics have wondered exactly what the point of the event is.\n\nSabalenka and Kyrgios insist it is to attract a different audience to the sport, with an emphasis on fun, entertainment and celebrity culture.\n\n\"There are question marks - and that scares people,\" Kyrgios said.\n\n\"For us, it is exciting and gives us that thrill. I think events like this need to happen \n\nThe event, being held at the 17,000-seater Coca-Cola Arena, is on track to be sold out.\n\nTickets range from about £100 in the upper tier stands to upwards of £600 on courtside benches.\n\n\"Sport and entertainment is the same thing – people come to watch sport for the unknown, that's why it is not played on paper,\" Kyrgios said.\n\n\"Whether it's good or bad, they want to remember something they are going to see in everyday life.\"\n\nBillie Jean King, who beat Bobby Riggs in the second Battle of the Sexes match in 1973, hopes it will be a \"great\" match but says it is \"not the same\" as her era-defining event.\n\nKing's victory over former Wimbledon champion Riggs - a 55-year-old self-proclaimed chauvinist - was a landmark moment in the fight for gender equality and laid the path for equal pay at the top of the game.\n\n\"Ours was about social change; culturally, where we were in 1973. This one is not,\" King told BBC Sport.\n\nLive scores, results and order of play\n\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

But at the conclusion of the regular season, the Colts will enter another offseason filled with question marks.\n\nGM Chris Ballard is in his ninth season at the helm, the Colts still have unknowns at quarterback, Shane Steichen's status will be up in the air, and Indianapolis is without a first-round pick in the next two drafts.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: Colts eliminated from 2025 playoffs in a rare way",

We suffered together. If we always have this spirit, we are going to win so many games.\"\n\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe headed back to the north-east of England reflecting on yet another disappointing away performance. He admitted his side failed to turn their territorial advantage into the type and volume of meaningful chances that would have earned maximum points.\n\nBut for the home side, the outcome felt significant.\n\nLisandro Martinez and Ayden Heaven are at other ends of the experience scale.\n\nOne is a World Cup winner, albeit one just returning from the latest in a sequence of bad injuries. The other is a 19-year-old with 15 senior appearances under his belt – who has now extended the longest playing sequence of his first-team career to five games.\n\nPaired together in the middle of a revised back four, with Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot as full-backs and Dorgu switched to the right side of Amorim's attack, Martinez and Heaven were immense.\n\n\"He [Martinez] is a guy with a lot of character,\" said Amorim.\n\n\"He is really good on the ball - and has won a World Cup, so he is used to that stress - but he showed today he is a top player.\n\n\"He is a small guy but today he did well against a team with tall players.\"\n\nThe sight of 5ft 9in Martinez leaping high to win a header against 6ft 6in Nick Woltemade in the first half was impressive.\n\nEven though there was an element of Amorim having to protect a player starting for the first time since February following his recovery from cruciate knee ligament surgery, there must have been concern when Martinez left the field two minutes from time and 20-year-old Tyler Fredricson came on in his place.\n\nFredricson did his job well. But he had Heaven with him to bring more solidity.\n\nIt is hard to believe when the former Arsenal youngster started against West Ham on 4 December, he was booked almost immediately and looked so shaky, it was almost a shock he lasted until half-time when he was replaced by Leny Yoro.\n\nIn the space of five games and three weeks, Heaven has advanced rapidly.\n\nHe was excellent in the defeat at Aston Villa on 21 December and followed that up with a performance of maturity against Newcastle that earned him the host broadcaster's man-of-the-match award.\n\nSo good has Heaven been that Amorim is warning Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt, currently sidelined, they can't be certain of getting their places back when they are fit again.\n\nThat is significant in two ways. Firstly, De Ligt was, by common consent, United's best defender until a back injury ruled him out of the West Ham game. Maguire, meanwhile, is still waiting to learn whether United will offer him a new contract when his current one expires in the summer.\n\n\"I am really pleased with Ayden,\" said Amorim.\n\n\"You can feel that he is improving every game. He trained really well, which shows if you train well, it can help you play.\n\n\"If he continues to play like that, it is going to be really hard to take his place.\"\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Stylists said dad sneakers are going out of style in 2026, in favor of slim, sporty silhouettes, like ballet-inspired sneakers and retro runners.",
    "fullText": "Sneaker culture is moving faster than ever. New styles drop constantly, older silhouettes return without warning, and it isn't always clear which trends will actually stick.\n\nSo, Business Insider asked three professional stylists to share the sneaker trends that'll still be going strong in 2026 — and the ones they suggest letting go. Here were their picks.\n\nAs quiet luxury continues to fade, sneakers that combine materials and bolder colorways are starting to take over, Natalie Tincher, principal stylist and founder of BU Style, told Business Insider.\n\nThis could look like anything from leopard print paired with bright-green accents to a combination of nylon and suede, or jacquard and lace prints, she said.\n\n\"I think we all get a little bit tired of the drabness of the fall-winter, so it's a great way to brighten an outfit, and then it also can lead you into spring-summer as well,\" Tincher said. \"So, it's a good investment.\"\n\nInstead of being reserved exclusively for fitness purposes, trail runners and hiking sneakers are becoming daily wear, Kendra Sharpe, stylist and founder of Kendra Sharpe Styling and Creative, said.\n\nShe told BI that \"they give a sporty vibe,\" thanks to their use of technical materials (such as bungee cord laces), and people are pairing them with dresses for an elevated take on athleisure.\n\nTincher highlighted the trend, too, and said it fits the Scandi (Scandinavian) trend of having more functional sneakers.\n\nSharpe said ballet-style sneakers are continuing to trend, and they can lean more dramatic or understated depending on your personal style.\n\nSome shoes may look like Mary Janes with a square toe box, while others may use silk materials or ankle straps to give that subtle ballerina feel, the stylist told BI, adding that \"the possibilities for this trend are growing.\"\n\nWith stricter return-to-office dress codes, Tincher said hybrid styles are becoming increasingly popular as people seek footwear that bridges the gap between casual and professional dressing.\n\nThese include loafers, Derbys, or Oxfords that feature sneaker soles, providing both comfort and support.\n\nAccording to both Sharpe and Tincher, low-profile retro sneakers will continue to be a major trend in the new year.\n\nThese minimalist sneakers typically features nylon uppers with a textured sole and a foamy footbed, giving them an old-school track look.\n\nIn line with the trend, Tincher said Adidas SL 72s are coming in hotter than the Sambas and Gazelles that have been popular recently, and also pointed to brands Reebok and Puma, which evoke a similar retro vibe.\n\nNajm Loyd, a men's stylist and content creator also known as Steelo, said sneakers with limited, exclusive drops are losing their appeal.\n\nInstead, he said products offering authentic storytelling are resonating more with consumers.\n\n\"I feel like people are coming into their own style and just wanting what speaks to them,\" Loyd told BI, adding that the price point is often a lot better, too.\n\nThis extends to himself, too. Rather than waiting on apps or in lines like he used to, he said, \"I'm more prone to go into the mall and find any sneaker that speaks to me and just grab that instead.\"\n\nThe very stark, clean, all-white sneaker is becoming less practical and versatile for year-round wear, Tincher said.\n\nInstead, she suggests opting for a sneaker with more neutral tones, such as cream, ivory, and gray, or a texture like suede, that works across seasons.\n\n\"You can still keep a lighter shoe in color, but it will work better for year-round tones and shades,\" she said.\n\nSharpe said elevated, platform-style sneakers aren't getting as much attention as lower-profile designs step into the spotlight.\n\nTincher also said that part of what's driving the shift is the rise of flare and wide-leg pants, which tend to look more balanced with a slimmer, streamlined shoe.\n\n\"If you have this smaller form, it's a nice juxtaposition to keep the look less heavy, and then the pant usually falls more nicely over it,\" Tincher said, adding that \"it creates longer, leaner lines.\"",

    "fullText": "A look back at the biggest tech stories of the year, from the rise and fall of Musk’s Doge to lucrative investments into AI\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, wishing you a happy and healthy end of the year. I myself have a cold.\n\nToday, we are looking back at the biggest stories in tech of 2025 – Elon Musk’s political rise, burst, and fall; artificial intelligence’s subsumption of the global economy, all other technology, and even the Earth’s topography; Australia’s remarkable social media ban; the tech industry’s new Trumpian politics; and, as a treat, a glimpse of the apocalypse offered by one of Silicon Valley’s savviest and strangest billionaires.\n\nAt the close of 2024, I wrote that Elon Musk’s support of Donald Trump had made him the world’s most powerful unelected man. In 2025, his reign turned out to be short-lived. He rose fast and haphazardly, like a whizzing firework, only to explode spectacularly in June when he claimed in a post on X that the president of the United States was named in the government’s files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEven in that short period of less than six months, Musk made a tremendous impact. He tore up wide swaths of the US government – tens of thousands of jobs, the security of extremely sensitive data, and entire agencies like USAID – that may never be stitched back together.\n\nAfter Doge imploded, Musk promised to turn back to his business empire, which saw great success and great failures alike in 2025. His rocket company SpaceX saw continued growth and is poised to conduct an initial public offering next year, perhaps as the most valuable private company in the world. Electric carmaker Tesla, by contrast, faced violent backlash and major competition from its Chinese counterparts, which produced cheaper and more advanced vehicles while Tesla’s innovation and inventory stagnated.

The Magnificent Seven – Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla – are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into new software that they hope will do the bulk of humanity’s work before too long. The investment is driving the bulk of the growth of the US’s economy, giving rise to fears of a financial bubble and its popping. The US and China are locked in a cold war-esque race against each other, with startups in each country vying for cutting-edge breakthroughs, as governments around the world are forced to decide how they will regulate a new technological force.\n\nBefore AI can arrive at that future, though, it needs brains a la the Tin Man of The Wizard of Oz. Those brains come in the form of data centers. These massive buildings, which house the millions and millions of semiconductor chips booming AI development, have cropped up around the world, met with enthusiasm from leaders eager for tax revenue and deep concern from environmental advocates and, increasingly, local community members. The investment in and construction of data centers wrought huge change in the physical landscape of the Earth in 2025 as tens of billions of dollars chased any available land, electricity, water and semiconductor chips.\n\nMore from our reporting in the last year:\n\nThe AI boom is heralding a new gold rush in the American west\n\nRevealed: Big tech’s new datacentres will take water from the world’s driest areas\n\nWhat will your life look like in 2035?\n\n‘It’s going much too fast’: the inside story of the race to create the ultimate AI\n\nMulti-trillion-dollar valuations\n\nIs AI a bubble that’s about to pop? – podcast\n\nWhat is new in UK-US tech deal and what will it mean for the British economy?\n\nMeet the AI workers who tell their friends and family to stay away from AI\n\nElon Musk made a full-throated and whole-hearted embrace of Donald Trump in 2024 and 2025.

The tech giants continued their embrace of Trump and his policies by scuttling their diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, which they championed during Barack Obama’s presidency, and by cooperating with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Trump’s harsh immigration crackdown. What the industry gave, it reaped tenfold in deregulation, friends high up in Washington like JD Vance and David Sacks, and a Trump order for states not to regulate AI signed just weeks ago.\n\nMore from our reporting this year:\n\nDonations and Trump’s inauguration\n\nElon Musk appears to give fascist-style salute after Trump inauguration – video\n\nTrump inauguration: Zuckerberg, Bezos and Musk seated in front of cabinet picks\n\n‘The reign of terror is over’: my weird weekend partying with the triumphant tech right\n\nZuckerberg’s swerve: how diversity went from being a Meta priority to getting cancelled\n\nDocuments offer rare insight on ICE’s close relationship with Palantir\n\nICE is using smartwatches to track pregnant women, even during labor: ‘She was so afraid they would take her baby’\n\nThis year saw Australia take the extraordinary measure of banning children under 16 from social media.

    "fullText": "Broncos' 11-game winning streak halted in devastating fashion by upstart Jaguars originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Denver Broncos had not lost a game since September 21. That changed on Sunday, when the Jacksonville Jaguars strolled into Empower Field and handed them a 34-20 defeat.\n\nThe loss tightens things up on the AFC playoff race as the Broncos are now just one game ahead of the Los Angeles Chargers in the AFC West and could be tied with the New England Patriots for the No. 1 overall seed, depending on what happens in New England's Sunday night tilt with the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nThe story of this game was much more about what Jacksonville did right than what Denver did wrong. The Jags were efficient on offense, moving the ball well against Denver's vaunted defense and cashing in against the league's best red-zone defense.\n\nTrevor Lawrence, coming off the best game of his career last week, had another gem on Sunday, completing 23 of 36 passes for 279 yards with three touchdowns. Parker Washington had 145 yards receiving on six catches, forcing several missed tackles throughout the contest.\n\nThe Broncos had their chances to respond to the big shots being delivered by the Jaguars, but two second-half turnovers by Bo Nix knocked the Broncos out.\n\nThe Jaguars continued their historically good play in the Mile High City and now have a winning record of 5-4 all-time there. With the win, Jacksonville improves to 11-4 on the season, still very much in the race for the No. 1 overall seed and home-field advantage in the playoffs.\n\nREAD: 4 2026 offensive NFL Draft targets who could wind up with Denver Broncos\n\nThe Broncos won't have much time to sit and sulk over this loss as they will be back on the field on Christmas night at Arrowhead Stadium against the sputtering Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nBroncos vs. Jaguars Series History: Teams will meet for 16th time in Week 16\n\n5 Denver Broncos players who will not be with the team in 2026\n\nBroncos get two players returns in Week 16, including one who hasn't played in two years\n\nFormer Pro Bowl wide receiver makes huge claim for Denver Broncos this season\n\nDenver Broncos give clear sign that key offensive starter will return to action in Week 16",

    "fullText": "We're in the thick of the holiday season, and that can only mean one thing on Wall Street: Blackstone's annual holiday video is out.\n\nThe tongue-in-cheek video leans into the private equity shop's 40th anniversary with a mocking tribute to its 1980s origins. It riffs on everything from Ken Burns-style narration, including an abrupt firing of Burns himself in favor of some \"pizzazz,\" to execs dancing their way through \"Dirty Dancing\"-style choreography.\n\nExecutives portraying the firm's mid-life crisis include one who wears a nose ring and others who want to buy sports teams or Ferrari (the company). Cameos include actor Danny DeVito pitching jargon-filled investment products, as well as Goldman Sachs CEO (and side-hustling DJ) David Solomon.\n\nThe seven-and-a-half-minute video concludes with Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman and President Jon Gray in a parody of the \"Back to the Future\" movie.\n\nBlackstone is no stranger to quirky holiday videos. In fact, this was their 8th in a row (see where this year's video lands in BI's power ranking).\n\nYou might be wondering: Why does Blackstone spend so much time, effort, and money on such a thing, especially when few other financial firms do? Apollo produced its own holiday video in 2022, but this year the private-equity firm appears to have pivoted to publishing.\n\nBlackstone produced its first holiday video in 2018 as a replacement for its New York holiday party, as the firm had grown too large. Earlier this month, at a conference, Gray said the video was a way for the world's largest private investor to \"make fun of ourselves.\"\n\nBlackstone's video ends on a poignant note in memory of Wesley LePatner, a Blackstone executive who was killed in the tragic summer shooting at the firm's NYC headquarters. The video said she \"always made us smile.\"",

Sorry Joe, I never do this - love you man.\"\n\nEngland's Cullen won the first set, but became the 11th seed to crash out as he lost the following three, including throwing away a 2-1 lead in the fourth set.\n\nReferring to the way that Suljovic slowed down play, Cullen said in a post on X: \"If that's darts, I don't want no part of it.\n\n\"Always liked Mensur away from the board but that was plain for all to see! I don't think I'm alone in feeling this way. The old guard will say it's part of the game but word it how you will - it's cheating. That's not darts.\"\n\nAfter the match, the 36-year-old shook his head as he picked up his darts case and turned to glare at the Austrian, who celebrated his win in front of the crowd.\n\nThe PDC does not have a specific, timed rule for pace of play, but deliberate slow play intended to disrupt an opponent is considered unsportsmanlike conduct and a potential rules breach.\n\nSuljovic is next in line to take on defending champion Luke Littler, who faces David Davies on Sunday evening.\n\nMeanwhile, 2018 champion and 17th seed Rob Cross managed to avoid a deciding set against Ian White as he won a nervy encounter 3-1.\n\nKrzysztof Ratajski beat Ryan Joyce 3-1 to reach the third round, while Luke Woodhouse cruised past Max Hopp with a victory in straight sets.",

    "fullText": "It doesn't have to be conventional -- if it works.\n\nDenver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix has turned heads this season with no-look throws, falling-down touchdown passes and various unconventional throwing angles. He's been discouraged from playing like that since he was a kid -- even by his father, Patrick Nix, who coached him in high school.\n\n“I think I've always been able to do it,\" Nix said of his unique throws. \"It was probably from playing baseball as a young kid to playing football, and just a lot of different backyard styles of play. But early on in your career, a lot of people told you that wasn't how you were supposed to do it, and you had to do it a different way, my dad being one of them. So you work to be on platform and to throw it with the perfect mechanics every time. Sometimes it works that way, and you get to do it and other times it doesn't. I think the ability to be able to use different angles just helps you within the pocket, helps you navigate windows.\n\n\"It can be tough on a defense. They can't really time you up and get batted passes or just gives you another opportunity if they got a hand in your face, whatever it may be. It's just like a shooter getting a shot off in a different way, getting to the rim, and having a shooter lay up in a different spot. Every once in a while, you want to be in a perfect shooting position, but sometimes that doesn't happen, and so have to have a different angle or whatnot. I think it's a strength that a lot of guys are working on, and I think it's just going to get more and more creative honestly as guys move forward.”\n\nOne of Nix's off-platform throws was a whipped pass to tight end Evan Engram against the Green Bay Packers on Sunday. Engram plucked it out of the air with one hand to help keep things alive on a crucial drive.\n\nBo Nix hits Evan Engram who snags the ball with one hand\n\nSweet game yesterday!\n\n(excuse the audio equipment) pic.twitter.com/6GMaFYfbkj\n\n— BroncoBlog (@MileHighDubs88) December 15, 2025\n\nMost underrated play from Sunday imo\n\n3rd and long early, drive in jeopardy, need a TD to take the lead.\n\nBo gets the ball out awkwardly, narrowly avoiding Parsons, Engram snags it with one hand, sheds a tackle and gets us to 4th and 1, leading to a sneak and later a TD that… pic.twitter.com/hTZ0M9BT31\n\n— Bryce 🎸 (@MileHighMims) December 16, 2025\n\n“Sometimes it's just athleticism, sometimes it's just a reaction,\" Nix said. \"At that point, my eyes saw Evan as open and my body reacted to getting him the football as quickly as possible. I think it just, you know, automatically went to a way of throwing that I could do, but the fastest one that I had. It's cool to go back and watch those and you're like, ‘Man, I didn't even realize it looked like that or didn't even realize that's what I did.’ Sometimes it's just sudden movements, and you train your body to be quick. You definitely have to practice that way. You have to practice full speed at all times, try to get different looks at it. But that ended up being one of the most important plays in the game.”\n\nNix and Co. now turn their attention toward the Jacksonville Jaguars, who will visit Empower Field at Mile High on Sunday. With a win (and some help from other teams), the Broncos can clinch an AFC West title and the No. 1 seed in the conference this weekend.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL: Coaches (including his dad) discouraged Bo Nix's backyard style",

    "fullText": "Emphasis this year is on nostalgia as present day feels ‘a bit more uncertain’, say trend experts\n\nTinsel, DIY tree decorations, deep burgundy drapes – and Home Alone on VHS. Christmas has gone retro on TikTok, and in people’s living rooms.\n\nThe app has reported a surge in Christmas decor videos, with an emphasis on nostalgia as users embrace festive looks from bygone eras. For younger TikTokers, that means the 90s.\n\nMore than 8,000 videos have been posted under the hashtag #90sChristmas, celebrating a look that includes multicoloured tree lights, homemade felt ornaments and – in a post with nearly 4m views – VHS tapes of Christmas classics such as the Macaulay Culkin caper.\n\nTikTok said Christmas decor videos had increased by 100% over the past 12 months, with commentators saying the emphasis on nostalgia reflects a need for stability in uncertain times.\n\n“There is a sense of inherent nostalgia in these trends,” says Hugh Metcalf, editor of the interior decor website Livingetc.com. “These are not super-contemporary looks. It’s a search for comfort from yesteryear when things right now are a bit more uncertain.”\n\nWGSN, a consumer trend forecasting firm, says the 90s Christmas trend indicates a general rising nostalgia for that decade, which also came across during Halloween as an embrace of “tacky decor” pushed at notions of what constitutes good taste.\n\nMetcalf says TikTok is “super influential” for Christmas aesthetics across all generations, with online influencers having greater sway over festive aesthetics than they do over interior decor trends across the rest of the year, which tend to be the province of design professionals.\n\n“These Christmas trends are for things people have seen and experienced before,” Metcalf adds. “It’s appealing to personal histories and our sense of emotion, a bit of relief from trying to get the newest, most interesting interior design idea.”\n\nEven more popular than the 90s take this year is Ralph Lauren Christmas, riffing on the American designer’s signature looks with deep colours, rich wooden panelling and green tartan prints. TikTokers has also offered tips on how to afford a festive take on the luxury brand if you’re on a budget.\n\nWGSN says the Ralph Lauren yuletide aesthetic represents a broader push for “new classic iterations and traditional vibes” over the Christmas season. Describing the trend as “cross-generational nostalgia”, WGSM says it is manifesting itself in looks like cosy knits, windowsill candles and bannister garlands.\n\n“Explorations of these classic looks are gaining strength even among younger consumers,” says Cassandra Gagnon, a WGSN strategist.\n\nIf the late 20th century isn’t distant enough as we peer through the retro tinsel from our 2025 vantage point, then WGSN also reports interest in “opulent antiquity”, including velvet Christmas stockings and tree skirts. It means terms such as “Little Women Christmas” – inspired by the Louisa May Alcott classic – are also trending on the platform.\n\nTime has also been kinder to The Holiday, a romantic comedy film which received some negative reviews on its release nearly two decades ago but has become a decor influence on TikTok this year as well. Named after the film’s director, the #NancyMeyersAesthetic hashtag has more than 35,000 videos – Meyers also directed Father of the Bride and The Parent Trap – with the Christmas iteration focusing on warm interiors and the traditional festive look seen elsewhere on the app.\n\nBut in terms of the soundtrack for the season, another decade wins: the 80s. Last Christmas by Wham! is the most searched Christmas song on TikTok so far this month.",

    "fullText": "The bag you carry can say a lot about you.\n\nA designer purse, for example, can signal wealth and style, while a Trader Joe's tote bag might symbolize pop culture and trendiness — especially to Gen Z.\n\nYour purse can also be a tool toward productivity. Speaking with Business Insider, women working across various industries said they rely on their daily bags to carry their office gear, wallets, and other essentials.\n\n\"I love a bag more than shoes, more than clothes, more than anything else,\" Erin Piper, the founder of the skincare brand Saint Crewe, told Business Insider. \"All I need is a great bag.\"\n\nFrom a Loewe clutch to an olive-print tote, these are the bags that those professional women swear by — and if you're looking for more inspiration, check out our Reviews team's guide to the best work bags for women.\n\nJanel Barden, 27, typically runs LuxeHaus Management — the talent and marketing agency she co-founded — from home. But on occasion, she prefers to visit a shared workspace or a café.\n\nWhen she does, she carries her laptop, headphones, wallet, sunglasses, and \n\nIt's made entirely from suede fabric and brass hardware.\n\n\"Throwing all my stuff in a big, stylish bag keeps me way more organized than if I were holding my laptop and running around with it,\" Barden said.\n\nWhen she's not working, Barden carries the $395 Pine purse from Staud.\n\nIt's made from pebbled leather, features two silver buckles across its strap, and has the brand's name embossed on one side.\n\nVictoria Villanueva, 25, co-founded LuxeHaus Management with Barden. Speaking with Business Insider, she said the $695 New York bag from DeMellier London is her \"go-to for fall and winter.\"\n\n\"It's stunning,\" she said of the bag's dark brown color and suede fabric. She carries her laptop, Kindle, and a pencil pouch, among other things, inside.\n\nThe bag is made from sustainable suede and cotton, and is handcrafted by 34 artisans, according to the brand's website.\n\nSabrina Guler, 32, is the founder of Intuitive CEO, an advisory studio that helps new brands grow and raise capital.\n\nWhen taking coffee and lunch meetings, the CEO carries the $620 Numéro Dix purse from Polène. She describes it as her \"understated wealth bag.\"\n\nIt's made from Italian calf leather and has a velvet lining.\n\n\"Polène has been one of my favorite emerging brands for years,\" she said. \"The leather quality is incredible, and the sculptural shapes instantly elevate any outfit. The brand is still growing and highly underrated.\"\n\nShe says the $2,170 Neverfull tote from Louis Vuitton is a \"timeless classic.\"\n\n\"The durability and leather quality never cease to amaze me,\" Guler said about the bag, which is made with leather and Damier Ebene canvas. \"It holds up beautifully over time.\"\n\nIt features shoulder straps, side laces, and a removable pouch that can be carried as a clutch.\n\nErin Piper, 43, is the founder of the skincare brand Saint Crewe and a mother of two.\n\nShe told Business Insider that while she loves shoes and clothes, bags are her favorite accessories.\n\n\"My Celine purse goes with me to anything business-related,\" she said. \"I like to think she brings me luck.\"\n\nShe carries the Nano-Grained Calfskin Belt Bag, which is no longer sold by the designer brand. However, it's often found on sites like TheRealReal.\n\nFor everyday outings, she uses the $3,150 medium-sized Flamenco clutch from Loewe.\n\n\"It doesn't scratch, and I'm constantly throwing it around,\" she said.\n\nNikki Seaman, 30, is the founder and CEO of Freestyle Snacks, a food brand that offers premium olives and pickles in to-go pouches.\n\nNaturally, her daily office bag — the $195 Lydia quilted bag from Rachel Antonoff — has a colorful olive print all over it.\n\n\"I like to be a walking billboard for my brand,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nThe 24.5-inch-long bag is made entirely from poplin cotton, and it features a shoulder strap above its zippered pocket.\n\nIn addition to being a founder and CEO, Seaman is also a mom of two boys. She relies on an $875 diaper bag from the French designer brand Chloé to carry everything she needs for them.\n\nThe cotton tote has top handles, a leather shoulder strap, and numerous pockets.

    "fullText": "The holiday season always brings out the specialty coffee drinkers, whether they are fans of Starbucks' Peppermint Mocha or Caramel Brulée Latte, or maybe Peet's Dubai Style Chocolate Matcha or Pistachio CBOL.\n\nThe wait for one of these holiday treats in coffee shops or drive-thru lanes can take longer than normal as a result of the higher demand this time of year.\n\nBut many customers believe it is worth the wait to enjoy one of these tasty drinks.\n\nUnfortunately, the rest of the year may not have been as bright and shiny as the holiday season seems, as coffee chain giant Starbucks plans 100s of store closings. Peet's also closed several locations, but has some good news on the horizon.\n\nStarbucks in September revealed that it would reduce its North American store count by about 1%, or from 18,734 shops to 18,300 by the end of fiscal year 2025, as part of a restructuring that is expected to cost the coffee giant $1 billion.\n\nStarbucks reviewed its North America portfolio earlier this year to determine which locations it would close.\n\n\"During the review, we identified coffeehouses where we're unable to create the physical environment our customers and partners expect, or where we don't see a path to financial performance, and these locations will be closed,\" Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol said in a statement.\n\nThe company will target underperforming stores, or those that can't meet new design standards, for closing. The company is conducting a multi-year remodeling plan for 1,000 locations at a cost of $150,000 per store through 2026.\n\nReduce store count by 434 locations, or 1%, by the end of fiscal year 2025.\n\nRemodel 1,000 locations at $150,000 per store by the end of 2026.\n\nPeet's, which has over 250 locations in the U.S. with 199 corporate-owned stores, according to The E'ville Eye, closed California locations in Roseville in May, Sacramento Airport in September, and in Mill Valley in November.\n\nThe good news for Peet's came in August as Keurig Dr Pepper revealed that it would buy the company's parent JDE Peet's for $18 billion in a transaction that is expected to close in the first half of 2026.\n\nAnd now, troubled Starbucks rival coffee chain Compass Coffee has agreed to vacate its Washington, D.C., roastery location and has indicated in court papers that it might file for bankruptcy protection by the end of the year.\n\nThe Washington, D.C.-based coffee company agreed to relinquish its roastery facility at 1401 Okie Street, almost three months after a D.C. Superior Court Associate Judge Leslie Meek in September ordered Compass Coffee to pay monthly rent while a landlord lawsuit against the tenant proceeded, according to the Washington Business Journal.\n\nCompass Coffee's landlord American Armed Forces Mutual Aid Association in September filed for a protective order to require the tenant to pay an initial payment of over $113,000 and then over $116,000 per month starting on Oct. 1, which the judge granted.\n\nCasual Mexican restaurant chain closes more locations\n\n79-year-old national trucking company closes down, no bankruptcy\n\n65-year-old Home Depot rival shutters business permanently\n\nThe tenant had not paid rent since January 2025, according to court papers.\n\nBoth Compass Coffee CEO Michael Haft and the company's lawyer Theodore B. Randles of Venable LLP indicated in September that the company would have to vacate the premises or possibly file for bankruptcy if the coffee chain couldn't negotiate a rent reduction.\n\nCompass Coffee owes its landlord, American Armed Forces Mutual Aid Association, over $744,000 in rent and related fees, Washington Business Journal reported.\n\nThe coffee company also owes over $300,000 in back rent to the property's previous landlord, Douglas Development Corp., according to a lawsuit filed by that landlord.\n\nCompass Coffee was established in 2014 and currently operates 25 locations in Washington, D.C., Virginia, and Maryland.\n\n4710 Langston Blvd., Arlington, Va.\n\n4300 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, Va.\n\n4100 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, Va.\n\n3003 Washington Blvd., Arlington, Va.\n\n7393 Lee Highway, Falls Church, Va.\n\n1201 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, Va.\n\n4850 Massachusetts Ave. NW, Washington, D.C.\n\n1351 Wisconsin Ave. NW, Washington, D.C.\n\n2150 P St. NW, Washington, D.C.\n\n849 18th St. NW, Washington, D.C.\n\n1703 H.

    "title": "I'm a style editor who's obsessed with heels, and Inez makes some of the comfiest ones out there",
    "description": "Inez promises that they make truly comfortable heels and they couldn't be more correct. Here are our favorite styles and why we love them so much.",
    "fullText": "Anyone who knows me knows that I've made it a personal mission to find heels that are both genuinely comfortable and genuinely stylish. It's a quest I take a little too seriously — I've tested nearly every brand that claims to bridge that impossible gap, and I've paid for it with more blisters, ankle scrapes, and sore arches than I care to admit. When I wrote our guide to the most comfortable heels, I literally walked miles in dozens of pairs just to see which ones actually lived up to the hype.\n\nAll of that is to say: I don't hand out praise lightly. And that's why Inez stands out. Their heels look runway-worthy, but they're built with comfort features you can actually feel — plush, supportive insoles, discreet cushioning designed to absorb impact, and materials that make the shoes feel as good as they look. After all my testing, Inez is one of the few heel brands that truly delivers on both fronts.\n\nMost of the shoes retail for about $200-$300, and while that may seem steep at first, this luxury brand is worth the investment. Before Inez, I would spend way more than that on buying lots of cheaper pairs that were never comfortable. But these are shoes that I know I will have for a long, long time.\n\nHere are our top three styles, but read on to find in-depth reviews of these pairs and more.\n\nThis miraculously comfortable platform heel has quickly become one of my holy grail pieces for weddings. It's a towering four inches, but you won't feel the height at all.\n\nThis elegant boot has a 3.5-inch block heel, a sleek silhouette, and arch support all around. It's perfect for dressing up your fall outfits without sacrificing comfort.\n\nIf you're in the market for a pair of pumps to get you to formal work meetings, weddings, and everything in between, we highly recommend these supremely made shoes. Inez makes some of the most comfortable heels we've tried and these are no exception.\n\nI can't say enough great things about these platform heels. They tower at 3.9 inches, but the platform keeps the pitch shallow and the weight off of your toes.\n\nThe Camilla comes in many formalwear-ready colors, such as silver chrome, beige patent leather, and black lizard. When I wore them to a wedding, I was able to wear them for the full five hours of the ceremony and reception. This included a standing cocktail hour and a full two hours of dancing. At the end of the night, my feet were totally fine — not a blister or an ache to be felt.\n\nI'm a long-time fan of Inez, so trust me when I say that this is some of its best work. Just be aware that the footbed can run a little long, so you might want to size down a half-size.\n\nThis pick from Inez is one of our favorite heels we've ever tested. The suede exterior is luxurious and the footbed – like all of Inez's creations — is perfectly contoured. The heel is also 2.8 inches, which might seem like a lot, but it doesn't feel that way when you're wearing it.\n\nIt comes in a bunch of colors, from work-ready neutrals to party-ready purples (I'm obsessed with the orchid color pictured above). And there are three widths, which we love: slim, standard, and roomy. As far as fit, Inez says that it's best to go a half-size down in this style, which I agree with. Like most pumps or slingbacks, the slope of the shoe pushes your feet a little deeper into the toe, which means you might need a little less length in the footbed.\n\nThe only thing that slightly concerns me is that the backstrap has a bit of elastic that allows you to slip it on. I'm getting so much use out of these that I'm scared of the elastic stretching out and messing with the fit.\n\nPumps are difficult to get right. Unlike platforms or other kinds of creatively-designed shoes, there's no way of getting around the steep pitch. In fact, these are particularly steep. Aptly called the Alta, they have a towering heel height of 3.5 inches. You can get the style in a lower-height heel, called the Lola, if this sounds a little too tall for you. But don't be afraid to go with the higher heel. The shoes are far more comfortable than they look.\n\nAnd while I probably wouldn't recommend these for running around (you can literally run in some of Inez's highest heels, like the Pilar below), they are the ultimate secret weapon for feeling authoritative and stylish at work. Paired with one of the best suits for women, the Alta pumps make the ultimate power outfit.\n\nThe Paz is a chic, heeled ankle boot with a leg-elongating silhouette. Like all of Inez's shoes, this one is wildly comfortable for its heel height — so much so that writer Rebecca Strong named it one of the most comfortable boots she's ever tested. Here's what she had to say in that review:\n\n\" Magic — there's literally no other explanation for how these booties make my ultra-wide feet look so slim. Somehow, the \"snip\" toe offers ample room while still providing a tapered look that visually elongates my legs.\n\nThe fit also feels customized. The Inez Paz 70 is absurdly comfortable. I'll chalk that up to the proprietary plush insole, which offers plenty of cushioning and arch support — and the fact that the luxe suede upper has plenty of stretch to hug my foot like it was custom made.\"\n\nThe Paz 90 has the same elegant silhouette as the Paz 70, but it's 20 mm (or about ¾ of an inch) higher. You'd think this extra height might interfere with walkability, but it's still incredibly comfortable\n\nI named it one of the best ankle boots for women because of it's supreme combo of comfort and style. I love how the ankle shaft is tight to your leg, so it doesn't create any awkward gaps.\n\nIt also makes a great boot to pair with a skirt. Lots of short boots cut me off at the ankle, making my legs look shorter than they are. But this boot creates an elegant line, elongating your legs visually.\n\nThis chic knee-high boot comes in three materials: black calf leather, brown suede, and shiny brown leather that's textured like crocodile skin. I opted for the crocodile option, which definitely looks very high-fashion in person. I like the idea that as the leather bends and gets softer, the creases will fit in nicely with the outside texture.\n\nLike with the Pilar, the padded footbed on this shoe makes all the difference when it comes to comfort. They're super easy to walk in, even though the heel is 3-inches high. And like most of Inez's boots, these fit true to size so you won't have to worry about pinching or twisting due to sizing issues.\n\nThe one major issue that I had with this shoe is the height of the shaft. I'm five-foot-two, so my legs are a little shorter than average. This boot hit at the middle of my knee, which is a little unflattering. A knee-high boot should ideally hit right below the knee or a little lower. For context, I measured the shaft of these to be about 15-inches, which is about average for knee-high boots. But for my height, I prefer it to be around 13-inches.\n\nI've worked around this issue by pairing these with midi skirts that show off the boots while covering my knees. This is such a trendy way to wear boots that I don't mind. They also look pretty good with loose pants, but I avoid wearing them with mini skirts. And though there may not be different shaft heights available, there are two calf widths available. I opted for the standard calf version, which was a great fit.\n\nWhen I first saw this pair of boots, my wife had to basically pick my jaw up off the ground. I mean, they're utterly gorgeous, to say the least. They also come in wide calf and footbed sizing, which just made me even more sure that someone designed these special for me. I get so many compliments every time I wear them — to the point that I've been buying outfits specifically to pair with these boots!\n\nThe croc-embossed finish has a luxurious sheen to it that makes the boots look particularly elegant, and the texture and shine gives even the simplest sweater dress outfit a sophisticated flare. I love the brownish-burgundy pair I tested, but if you prefer a simpler look you can also opt for black leather or chestnut suede. Perhaps the biggest selling point was that I, a notorious heel hater, was able to wear these four hours on end while walking in the city thanks to the boots' well-constructed arch support.\n\nThe only drawback I can think of is one that every vertically challenged person who likes tall boots will understand, and that's the fact that they dig into the back of your knee on stairs. It's not uncommon for short people to struggle with knee-high boots on stairs, and it probably won't be an issue for you if you're over 5-foot-4 or so. But at 5-foot-2, I always fall victim to the back-of-the-knee issue. Otherwise, the heel height, pitch, and wide-calf fit, and option for a wide footbed make everything about the boot super comfortable when you're standing still or walking.\n\nThe Mila is the silhouette of the moment. I can't even tell you how many boots that look exactly like this I spotted on NYC's glitterati during fall fashion week. A pointed toe, a kitten heel, and a slouchy shaft have never been trendier — and the Mila combines them all. I got it in a luxurious black suede, but it's also available in olive, black, and silver leather.\n\nThese are a perfect middle ground between knee-high boots and ankle boots. They hit right at the calf muscle on me, which I was worried would be unflattering since I don't have mile-long legs like the model. But they look amazing with tights. And I can't wait to wear them peeking out from maxi skirts and paired with slim-fitting pants. The only thing I would avoid wearing them with is mini skirts with bare legs, since they tend to emphasize the widest part of my leg.\n\nAgain, I can't say enough good things about how comfortable these are. More than platforms or block heels, it takes a lot to make sure that kitten heels are comfortable and provide balance. And these pass the comfort test with flying colors. I would just caution anyone with particularly developed calf muscles that this may not work for them, since the shaft is a touch narrow.",

    "fullText": "From celebrity endorsements to digital fatigue, the once-obsolete white wire has become a fashion statement and a quiet act of opting out\n\nWith white-wired headphones endorsed by celebrities including Lily-Rose Depp, Paul Mescal, Bella Hadid and Apple Martin, a growing number of people are breaking away from wireless listening.\n\nFor inspiration, there is the Instagram account @wireditgirls, or a Balenciaga campaign featuring the model Mona Tougaard reclining bed, wired headphones in place.\n\nDaniel Rodgers, the fashion news editor at British Vogue, is familiar with the trend. “[It says] ‘I’m very effortless. I’m very nonchalant,” he says. “It’s become a real styleable accessory.”\n\nBut in a culture where the forward march of technology is often treated as compulsory, wired headphones represent more than aesthetics. “It’s an analogue way of opting out – of both tech but also life,” says Rodgers. “They’re visible in a way that AirPods aren’t. There is a sense of ‘do not disturb’.”\n\nThat symbolism is on full display on the cover of New York magazine’s latest issue, which features celebrities riding the subway: Debbie Harry with the Geese frontman Cameron Winter, Ben Stiller with the Knicks star Karl-Anthony Towns and Macaulay Culkin with the SubwayTakes presenter Kareem Rahma. The real story, however, is not the star power but the shared accessory in each image: wired headphones.\n\nThe pictures were taken by Hannah La Follette Ryan, the Brooklyn-based photographer behind the Instagram account @SubwayTakes, which documents New Yorkers on public transport. She says: “I see the revival as an extension of digital fatigue. Who wants another glitchy expensive gadget to charge?”\n\nPrice is clearly part of the appeal of wired headphones – Apple’s EarPods cost £17 compared with £99 for AirPods – but nostalgia is also a factor.\n\n“We’re seeing retro tech come back,” says Tom Morgan-Freelander, the deputy editor of the technology magazine Stuff. “And as part of that, brands are starting to bring back wired headphones.”\n\nHe says some younger consumers are switching to wired for sound quality, which is typically better with cables. “Bluetooth became the norm, and there was an acceptance that, for wireless convenience, you’re going to lose a bit of quality,” he adds.\n\nThen there is the issue of tangles. While wireless headphones are stored neatly in a case, wired varieties are often found in a knot at the bottom of a bag.\n\nLa Follette Ryan suggests this is part of the appeal. “The tangle is inevitable,” she says. “Think of a headphone knot as a more user-friendly Rubik’s Cube. Relish the opportunity to slow down and solve a little puzzle.”\n\nIf wired headphones have become the choice of the fashion-conscious despite these inconveniences, that could change soon. AirPods remain the bestseller at Currys but the retailer reports sales of Beats Solo 4 over-ear headphones have risen by 193% since last year.\n\nMorgan-Freelander also points to the £20 FiiO Snowsky Wind, a design that looks like the earphones worn with a Sony Walkman in the 1980s.\n\nRodgers still believes wired headphones have the edge. “Even though we are constantly being [sold upgrades], there’s a sort of disengagement [with wired headphones], which is always really hot, right?” he says. “You never want to look like you’re too into anything.”\n\nLa Follette Ryan, however, thinks there is room for every option. “I just bought a Discman and Sony headphones,” she says, “but I will always keep my wired headphones for sharing an earbud with a friend.”",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Dec 18 (Reuters) - China on Thursday split off a Belgium-sized island with an economy comparable to a mid-sized country from the mainland for customs processing, part of a bid to join a major trans-Pacific trade deal and establish ​a new Hong Kong-style commercial hub.\n\nOfficials hope that turning the southern province of Hainan into a duty-free zone will spur foreign investment, ‌with goods that achieve at least 30% local value add able to move on into the world's second-largest economy tariff-free. Foreign firms will also be able to operate in service ‌sectors that are restricted on the mainland.\n\nChina is also seeking to boost its free-trade credentials to convince members of one of the world's largest free-trade deals, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), that it can meet the bloc's high standards for trade and investment openness through pilot projects such as the Hainan Free Trade Port.\n\n\"China aims to build the Hainan Free Trade Port into an important gateway that leads the country's opening-up into a new era,\" ⁠an editorial by the state news agency Xinhua said.\n\n\"It ‌is also expected to provide a huge boost for free trade that has been impacted by rising protectionism and unilateralism in recent years,\" the article added, in a veiled swipe at U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, which have pushed ‍policymakers to diversify China's $19 trillion economy from the world's top consumer market and take steps to further consolidate the manufacturing juggernaut's role in global supply chains.\n\nChina's leaders have made reversing a drop in investment a priority for next year, seeking to shift the economy from its current reliance on stimulus toward a dual focus on ​consumption and investment to stabilise growth in the near-term, while officials evaluate undertaking painful structural reforms needed to rebalance the economy long-term.\n\nForeign direct ‌investment into China fell 10.4% year-on-year in the first three quarters of 2025, official data shows.\n\nIf liberalisation succeeds in Hainan, economists say policymakers may feel emboldened to expose more of China's economy to market forces.\n\n\"The benchmark is something similar to Hong Kong,\" said Ran Guo, director for Consumer Economy at the China-Britain Business Council, who has been tracking the plan's developments for the past five years.\n\n\"In addition to boosting Hainan's tourism sector, the plan should also encourage more foreign investment and manufacturing,\" she added.",

    "title": "China may have reverse engineered EUV lithography tool in covert lab, report claims — employees given fake IDs to avoid secret project being detected, prototypes expected in 2028",
    "description": "China has reportedly built and begun testing a secret EUV lithography prototype using ASML-style laser-produced plasma technology. Yet, despite generating 13.5-nm light, the system remains unable to make chips and appears to be years away from achieving a complete, production-ready EUV manufacturing capability.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nA secret laboratory in China has quietly assembled a prototype extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography system and is now testing it stealthily, which means that the country may be close to replicating the most advanced technology that currently exists on Earth, reports Reuters.\n\nThe tool was reportedly developed by reverse engineering existing scanners from ASML and is said to be on-track to make prototype chips in 2028. If the information is correct, then Chinese scientists have made numerous breakthroughs across multiple disciplines in just a few years instead of decades, a scenario that appears extremely unlikely. Further analysis of the report indicates that China's laboratory is far from completing the tool, meaning that the country is years away from making chips using EUV lithography.\n\nThe system was reportedly completed in early 2025 inside a highly secured facility in Shenzhen and occupies nearly an entire factory floor. The Chinese machine reportedly generates EUV light with a wavelength of 13.5nm using the same laser-produced plasma (LPP) method as ASML Twinscan NXE machines, not the particle accelerator-based steady-state microbunching (SSMB) method designed at Tsinghua University or discharge-produced plasma (DPP) technology developed at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), which might prove the point that the system was reverse-engineered or at least contains a substantial amount of technologies pioneered by ASML.\n\nASML's laser-produced plasma (LPP) method uses tiny molten tin droplets, roughly 25–30 microns in diameter, which are injected into a vacuum chamber at a rate of about 50,000 droplets per second. Then, a high-power CO₂ laser first fires a low-intensity pre-pulse at each droplet, flattening it into a disk-like shape, followed by a more powerful main pulse that vaporizes the flattened tin and creates a superheated plasma with temperatures exceeding 200,000°C. This plasma emits isotropic EUV light, which is then collected by a large multilayer collector mirror and directed into the lithography system's reflective optics for patterning silicon wafers. This process repeats tens of thousands of times per second.\n\nThe machine is reportedly larger than the original, but it is operational in the sense that it can generate EUV radiation. However, it has not progressed to make usable chips as it still struggles to replicate 'the precision optical systems' features by Twinscan NXE systems. Furthermore, there is no word about power of the EUV light source, a crucial parameter that defines whether a tool can or cannot be used for volume production.\n\nThe report clearly states that the Chinese EUV scanner cannot currently be used to make chips, but the Chinese government reportedly wants the first chip prototypes to emerge in 2028, two or three years down the road. However, a more realistic target is 2030, four or five years from now, which is a long time. Meanwhile, from the report, it is not completely clear what stage the Chinese team is at today.\n\nThe report does not disclose which specific components of the optical system are the primary bottlenecks, as the article groups them rather generally. In particular, it is uncertain if the alleged EUV tool struggles to replicate the ultra-precise collector mirror system coated with multilayer molybdenum-silicon (Mo/Si) stacks, illuminator optics (which shapes and uniforms the beam using faceted mirrors), or projection optics (a series of aspheric mirrors for 4X – 8X reduction imaging with sub-nanometer wavefront errors). ASML outsources the development and production of these components to Carl Zeiss from Germany. If the developers failed to replicate the collector itself, then the rest of the machine can hardly be called an EUV lithography system, as technically, the only thing they have is some kind of light source that they have yet to learn how to use. Yet, even if the developers cannot replicate illuminator optics or projection optics (suggesting that the collector itself is there), it still means they do not have even a poorly working EUV lithography tool, but rather a set of certain components.\n\nWhen talking about advanced lithography equipment, we must keep in mind that such tools rely on seamless integration of sophisticated light sources, advanced optics, ultra-precise mechanical engineering, complex control software, and specialized materials, all of which must function reliably within nanometer-scale tolerances demanded by modern chip manufacturing. The story has no word about the state of the mechanical systems of the alleged tool: we know nothing about the wafer stocker system, wafer stages, or reticle stages, all of which are crucial for operation and yields.\n\nTo put China's EUV efforts into perspective, the secret lab is not even close to building an alpha tool. For now, what the Chinese lab has cannot even put the light on a wafer, save for printing lines and spaces, something ASML's tool could do in 2006, about 11 years before the company shipped its first Twinscan NXE:3400B system meant for high-volume manufacturing. Of course, reverse engineering certain components can give Chinese engineers a speed boost, but it remains to be seen how significant this one is going to be.\n\nAccording to Reuters's sources familiar with the effort, the Chinese EUV tool was 'developed' by a team that includes former engineers from ASML and recent university graduates, who allegedly reverse-engineered the company's EUV machines. The secret lab was so stealthy that its employees were given fake IDs to avoid detection of their concentration in one place by foreign spies.\n\nYet, it is unclear how any engineers from China could reverse engineer an EUV lithography scanner, as the Dutch company has never supplied one to China and hardly taught personnel from China how to service its EUV systems that are not allowed to be shipped to the People's Republic.\n\nReverse engineering a machine that contains over 100,000 parts is a hard task that takes hundreds of engineers with knowledge of the matter, which is why the secret entity led by the Government of China hired not only former engineers from ASML China, but also former employees of the Dutch company from elsewhere, presumably from Europe, Taiwan, and the U.S. For example, Lin Nan, formerly responsible for EUV light source technology at ASML, now leads a team at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Shanghai Institute of Optics that has filed eight EUV-related patents in just 18 months. Yet, this may mean that he uses his experience and knowledge rather than trying to replicate what he did at ASML or reverse engineer what he did at ASML due to the absence of an EUV scanner in his lab.\n\n“It makes sense that companies would want to replicate our technology, but doing so is no small feat,” a statement by ASML published by Reuters reads.\n\nThe report says that around 100 recent university graduates are tasked with reverse-engineering parts from EUV and DUV lithography tools, with each workplace monitored by a dedicated camera that records the disassembly and reassembly process, an important part of the whole China's lithography program, according to the report. Employees who successfully put components back together receive bonuses. Yet again, a Twinscan NXE tool is a mechanism consisting of over 100,000 parts working together, not just a sum of all parts.\n\nTo sum up, China has reportedly built a secret prototype EUV lithography system and begun testing it, which suggests that the country may be closer to reproducing the most advanced chipmaking technology in existence than previously believed. However, details provided by the report indicate that China is still years — if not a decade — away from making chips using EUV lithography.\n\nThe machine can generate 13.5-nm EUV light using the same laser-produced plasma (LPP) method employed by ASML, which may demonstrate extensive reverse engineering of Western technology rather than the use of alternative domestic approaches. However, the tool is significantly larger than commercial systems available today, it cannot produce usable chips, and appears to struggle with other elements of EUV lithography, particularly ultra-precise optics supplied to ASML by Carl Zeiss. In fact, details about the system like light source power, optical subsystem maturity, and the state of critical mechanical components remain unclear.\n\nWhile China expects first prototype EUV chips to emerge in 2028, Reuters's sources suggest 2030 is more realistic. Yet, the whole effort relies heavily on recruiting former ASML engineers and reverse engineering parts from existing EUV and DUV tools, which are not only hard to develop, but are extremely hard to make. Meanwhile, there is no word whether the current team responsible for disassembling and reassembling components can actually make an ultra-complex machine consisting of over 100,000 parts work flawlessly to produce semiconductors in high volumes.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.",

He wore a blue Thom Browne jacket that was tailored perfectly, a matching tie, and a white undershirt.\n\nUnfortunately, he styled the jacket with tight-fitting shorts that reached his thighs. The bottoms were too casual and didn't match his dark dress shoes.\n\nKelce, who played against the Philadelphia Eagles that day, completed the look with a $1,035 pair of Dita sunglasses.\n\nHe arrived for a game against the New York Giants while wearing a blazer, vest, and trousers all in the same burgundy shade.\n\nHe also wore black dress boots, a white undershirt, and a matching pocket square. His square sunglasses, which retail for $725, were designed by Tom Ford.\n\nThe outfit was sharp, simple, and highlighted his Louis Vuitton luggage.\n\nAhead of a game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Kelce donned khaki pants, a $2,650 Alfre button-up top from J. Logan Home, a brown suede jacket, and tan boots made from the same soft material.\n\nMost of the outfit worked as a transitional set for fall, especially when paired with his suede duffel bag.\n\nHowever, the suede newsboy cap Kelce wore dated the look. His overall outfit ended up resembling a costume more than a fashion statement.\n\nHe wore a $1,690 flannel top from Louis Vuitton, khaki pants, white sneakers, and Saint Laurent sunglasses before his game against the Detroit Lions.\n\nIt might not have been the most eye-catching outfit he wore this season, but it was contemporary and the epitome of quiet luxury.\n\nWhen the Chiefs played the Las Vegas Raiders in October, Kelce entered Arrowhead Stadium wearing skinny black trousers, a striped collared shirt, and a cropped leather jacket.\n\nThe top half of his outfit looked good, especially with the help of his square sunglasses.\n\nHowever, his choice of pants wasn't right. A baggier style would have made the difference, and some shining, silver jewelry could have elevated the overall look.\n\nKelce wore Fendi for a game against the Washington Commanders.\n\nHis three-piece outfit included orange jeans with frayed hems, a classic white T-shirt, and a denim jacket painted in shades of white and orange.\n\nThe outfit was bold and complemented by his tangerine-colored shades. He also wore statement gold necklaces with diamond charms.\n\nHe entered Arrowhead Stadium for a game against the Indianapolis Colts wearing a Nike windbreaker, matching pants, and Air Jordan sneakers.\n\nHis accessories — a hat, sunglasses, and watch — stood out and added a stylish element to the look.\n\nStill, the dark color and minimal design of his outfit made it forgettable.\n\nRather than wearing blue jeans and a basic flannel, Kelce walked into Arrowhead Stadium wearing a $1,790 tweed Amiri top, textured cargo pants from Diesel, and a $595 Guest In Residence hoodie.\n\nThe outfit was as festive as it was fashionable.",

    "title": "No, you're not seeing Hermès Kelly bags everywhere. Women are carrying look-alike purses from Tory Burch.",
    "description": "Tory Burch released its Lee Radziwill bag years ago — but it's becoming popular now. People love the quality, functionality, and style of the purse.",
    "fullText": "Paige Stansbury grew up shopping at Tory Burch.\n\nEach year, she'd vacation in Texas and shop at Houston's Galleria mall with her family. There, her grandmother always bought her a new pair of the designer's monogrammed ballet flats.\n\n\"I never really liked them,\" Stansbury, 23, admitted to Business Insider. \"But my grandma, she gets me into everything. She's a style icon.\"\n\nSo, when Stansbury saw a photo of a Lee Radziwill bag from Tory Burch in 2022, the social-media marketing professional added one in the petite size to her holiday wish list.\n\nIt was her grandmother, of course, who bought it for her.\n\n\"My grandma said it's the best bag and that I'd be obsessed with it,\" Stansbury said. \"I didn't start wearing it until recently, but she was right.\"\n\nShe loves her Lee Radziwill so much that she even made a TikTok video praising the purse. The post now has 2.3 million views, and countless comments from people who said they're buying their own.\n\nThe latter is just one reason the style is becoming a fashion status symbol for 2026.\n\nThough it's gaining traction now, the Lee Radziwill line from Tory Burch isn't new.\n\nIt was actually introduced in 2018 as an homage to its namesake, Lee Radziwill — a socialite, the sister of Jackie Kennedy, and a personal friend of designer Tory Burch.\n\nThe line features bags in various colors, sizes, and materials, all of which are square in shape. They also feature top shoulder straps and magnetic buckles across the front. They range in price between $520 and $1,320.\n\nIn June, Tory Burch began teasing a suede version of its Lee Radziwill bags on TikTok.\n\nAfter posting numerous videos throughout the summer, celebrities like Jessica Alba, Mindy Kaling, Ciara, and Emma Roberts carried their own Lee Radziwill bags at New York Fashion Week in September.\n\nOne fan said in a TikTok that month that the brand was \"relentlessly marketing\" the style, which caught her attention. When she went to purchase the bag, though, it was already sold out.\n\nThen, Stansbury's TikTok post about her Lee Radziwill bag went viral in December. In the comment section of her video, shoppers seemed eager to get their hands on the purses.\n\n\"Do I need another bag? No. Will I be buying this bag? Clearly, yes!\" one person wrote.\n\n\"That bag is so chic and exactly what I didn't know I wanted,\" another person commented.\n\nSome styles have since sold out online, and the brand posted a TikTok video on Monday that described its Lee Radziwill purse as \"the bag that broke the internet.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Tory Burch did not respond to a request for comment on the bag's popularity and plans for future releases.\n\nNicole King, 25, wasn't always a fan of Tory Burch. That changed in 2022 when she got her first Lee Radziwill bag. Now, the full-time content creator has a collection of eight.\n\n\"I have this icy-blue suede one, and to this day, it's the prettiest bag I've seen in my life,\" King told Business Insider. \"I always say that if there were ever a fire, that's one of the items I would save.\"\n\nShe's also a big fan of the miniature version of the bag, which she said is more functional than you'd think. When she got her first one, King said, she wore it for four months straight.\n\n\"It was my go-to, and I carry a lot of stuff on me,\" she said. \"It's also really easy to throw on. I forget that I'm carrying it.\"\n\nThen there's Chelsea Clark, a 38-year-old healthcare marketing professional who grew up with Tory Burch accessories.\n\nShe told Business Insider that she'd been eyeing Lee Radziwill bags since 2020 and officially bought her own in November.\n\nShe chose one in teal for a few reasons. First, she'd had a color analysis done and learned that she's a true winter. The bag matched her color palette. Second, she wanted something unique.\n\n\"The size was also a factor,\" Clark said. \"I'm 6 feet tall, and it's hard to find bags that I feel look good on really tall women. Most bags are too small or too large, like a weekender. My Lee Radziwill is the perfect size.\"\n\nAll three agreed that while the bags aren't necessarily cheap, they're worth splurging on.\n\n\"Some people have complained about the price, but at least it's not $4,000 for something that will tarnish and break,\" Stansbury said, adding that \"$660 for a bag that will hold is a great price.\"\n\nLet's not ignore the Hermès elephant in the room. Lee Radziwill bags, especially in the petite size, look a bit like Kelly bags from the famous French luxury brand.\n\nThey have similar shapes, matching buckle straps (or sangles, as Hermès refers to them), and are of a similar size. For many fans, that's part of the appeal. Why spend months trying to buy a $10,000 bag when you can pay $660 for a similar style from Tory Burch?\n\nOthers see things differently. The bags have similarities, sure, and there's no question that Hermès offers a flashier, more luxurious accessory — but some fans prefer Tory Burch's design.\n\nClark said she particularly likes that the Lee Radziwill bags have flat bottoms with no feet and a variety of pocket options.\n\n\"There's a timelessness to the bags,\" she said. \"The style of the Lee Radziwill, you can dress it up, or you can dress it down. I can't tell what timeline this bag is from when I look at it. It always looks modern to me.\"\n\nAnd luckily for Tory Burch, it's making the brand cool again.\n\nClark remembers a conversation with a young colleague in the recent past. She said they described the accessories brand to her as \"cheugy,\" or a cringy, millennial fad.\n\nThanks to Lee Radziwill bags, members of Gen Z are changing their tune.\n\n\"Every time I have it on me, someone compliments the bag,\" Stansbury said. \"It's constant.\"",

    "description": "Zillow analyzed millions of listings to forecast home design trends for 2026. Spa-like amenities and color drenching are in, while man caves are out.",
    "fullText": "Another year is on the way, and with it comes a fresh wave of home design trends. Zillow analyzed hundreds of design styles and home features across millions of for-sale listings in 2025, and identified the top emerging home trends for 2026.\n\n\"Listing descriptions are short, so every word counts,\" said Zillow's home trends expert Amanda Pendleton. \"When we see a sharp increase in certain features being mentioned in listings on Zillow, whether it's spa-inspired bathrooms or bespoke artisan craftsmanship, it's a clear signal that these details are capturing buyers' attention right now and hint at what's next in home design.\"\n\nWhile some of 2025's biggest home trends, such as eco-friendly homes and spa-style wellness amenities, will carry into 2026, new ones are also emerging.\n\nHere are seven home trends to watch in 2026 according to Zillow, from the evolution of the \"man cave\" into immersive sports spaces, to the growing demand for cozy reading nooks.\n\nMillennial gray is so 2020. There's a whole rainbow out there, and today's homeowners want bold, vivid color in their homes.\n\nZillow found that \"color drenching\" will be one of the hottest interior design trends in 2026. That's when the interior surfaces — from walls to floors and sometimes even the furniture — are all the same hue, typically a vibrant statement shade.\n\nMentions of the trend have increased by 149% since 2025, according to the company.\n\nZillow found that words like \"sustainable\" and \"green\" are appearing 21% more often in listings, suggesting that buyers are increasingly seeking out eco-friendly homes.\n\nEco-friendly homes do more than help the planet. They can also help homeowners save hundreds or even thousands of dollars by cutting energy use and, in turn, lowering utility bills.\n\nMentions of zero-energy-ready homes — which are built to minimize energy use and maximize renewable production with features like advanced insulation and high-performance windows — are up 70%.\n\nListings mentioning whole-home batteries, which store solar energy and provide backup power, are also up 40%, while references to electric-vehicle charging have climbed 25%.\n\nFrom the Palisades wildfires to the Texas Hill Country floods, this year's natural disasters have claimed many lives and cost the US government and its citizens billions of dollars.\n\nSo it's no surprise that many buyers are seeking homes that offer better protection during extreme weather conditions. According to Zillow, 64% more listings mention flood protection, and references to elevation in relation to flooding have increased by 26%.\n\nBuyers are also increasingly worried about fire risk. Zillow data shows fire-safety features are appearing more often in listings, with mentions of defensible-space landscaping up 36% and fire-protection systems up 28%.\n\nIn a culture built on convenience, anything you can get at home quickly becomes something you expect at home.\n\nMany homeowners have moved beyond standard home-wellness amenities, such as home gyms and basketball courts, and into upgrades like saunas and cold plunges — features once limited to luxury spas but now increasingly attainable through thoughtful home design.\n\nWellness is set to remain a key driver of home design in 2026. According to Zillow, mentions of wellness features in listings are up 33%, and spa-inspired elements are appearing 22% more often on the site.\n\nNews flash: reading is cool again.\n\nIf you've been on social media lately, you've probably seen the chic home libraries that young, design-minded homeowners are putting together. Big or small, they tend to be cozy and highly Instagrammable.\n\nBuyers are taking note as we head into next year. Zillow found that mentions of \"reading nooks\" are appearing 48% more often in its listings.\n\nBuyers are increasingly moving away from generic, copy-and-paste interiors in favor of homes that reflect their personalities.\n\nAccording to Zillow, mentions of vintage accents, whimsical details, and artisan craftsmanship are up 17%, 15%, and 21%, respectively.\n\nThe once-ubiquitous \"man cave\" is finally fading, with Zillow data showing mentions in listings down 10% from last year — but spouses shouldn't celebrate just yet.\n\nBuyers don't just want a room to watch the game anymore; they want spaces that let them fully immerse themselves in their favorite sports.\n\nZillow found that golf simulators are appearing 25% more frequently in listings on its site, while mentions of pickleball courts are also up 25%. Even batting cages are becoming more popular, with references rising 18%.",

    "title": "The best street-style outfits Taylor Swift has ever worn",
    "description": "Taylor Swift is known for her glamorous red-carpet looks and sparkling stage outfits. In her everyday life, she's equally fashionable and flashy.",
    "fullText": "Taylor Swift knows a thing or two about fashion.\n\nOf course, she has a certified triple platinum single titled \"Style.\" But there's also the matter of her concert outfits, red-carpet looks, and standout street style.\n\nThe latter, in particular, has evolved greatly over the years. She once stepped out in outfits comprised of miniskirts and tank tops — but now sports designer looks from Vivienne Westwood and shoes from Christian Louboutin.\n\nHere are the best ensembles she's worn while out and about over the years.\n\nFor a New York City outing in November 2011, for example, Swift tucked a navy, cable-knit sweater by Ralph Lauren into a pleated yellow skirt from ModCloth.\n\nHer academia-esque look was completed with magenta Marc Jacobs kitten heels, red lipstick, and a blue Fendi purse that matched the sparkling 13 drawn on her hand.\n\nLess than a month after her fifth studio album was released, Swift was photographed spending time with Karlie Kloss in New York City.\n\nShe wore a little black dress underneath a tan, tattersall coat, sheer polka-dot tights, and lace-up heeled Oxfords.\n\nSwift also carried a burgundy purse and sported a thin gold headband adorned with a small bow.\n\nIn August 2016, Swift walked around New York City while wearing a pink Brandy Melville tank top underneath a denim overall-style dress from Tularosa.\n\nShe also sported a black Marni bag and flower-printed sneakers from Gucci.\n\nOne evening in September 2016, Swift was photographed wearing a black V-neck Aritzia bodysuit worn underneath a white miniskirt from Related Apparel.\n\nBut her accessories really made the outfit. Swift wore strappy sandals from Louise et Cie, a tan clutch by Aspinal of London, and a white choker necklace from Adornmonde.\n\nHer striped, long-sleeved bodysuit was from PH5, while her pleated, burgundy miniskirt was from Urban Outfitters.\n\nShe wore both pieces with Michael Kors sunglasses, a Burberry bag, and platform, velvet sandals from Aquazurra.\n\nShe was photographed in July of that year wearing a pinstriped Unravel Project shirt hanging off one shoulder and distressed denim shorts from Gucci.\n\nWhile the casual outfit matched the dark aesthetic of her sixth studio album — as did her black leather Tod's boots and Tommy Hilfiger bag — her vibrant lipstick, wavy hair, and Miu Miu earrings hinted at the era to come.\n\nDays before her song \"ME!\" was released to the world, Swift stepped out in New York City wearing one of her quirkiest outfits to date.\n\nIt consisted of a floral Zimmermann dress, a red Mango blazer, and Rupert Sanderson sandals.\n\nThe highlights of Swift's outfit, however, were her pink-tinted hair and her cat-printed purse from Anya Hindmarch.\n\nAfter performing three sold-out shows at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, in late May, Swift was photographed outside Electric Lady Studios in New York City.\n\nShe wore a black cotton dress with a black belt around the waist, $450 Waylon slide sandals from Anine Bing, $200 Indio sunglasses from the same brand, and a brown version of the $895 M Frame Box Bag from Mansur Gavriel.\n\nBut most impressive was Swift's gold, diamond-encrusted Cartier necklace from the 1980s.\n\nThe sparkling jewelry — called the Agrafe Herringbone Twisted Necklace — is no longer produced, but one was sold on 1stDibs, an online luxury marketplace, for $27,250.\n\nShe wore a pinstripe shirt from The Row over a pleated Free People skort and paired both pieces with a baseball cap, lace-up shoes, and a Patou purse.\n\nSwift's navy pants were designed by Vince, while her sheer cashmere tank top was by Gabriela Hearst.\n\nShe wore them with ankle boots from The Row, a Ralph Lauren baseball cap, and a purse from Yuzefi.\n\nHer chic black-and-gold ensemble featured an $825 houndstooth coat from Gant over a Versace corset top and high-waisted black trousers.\n\nShe also carried the $340 Nirvana bag from Aupen and wore a $70 gold necklace from Mazin Jewels. Her updo hairstyle and red lipstick completed the look.\n\nShe was photographed in New York City wearing an $850 rugby shirt from Stella McCartney as a dress.\n\nShe wore the shirt, which was emblazoned with a golden horse design, with knee-high Prada boots in an auburn shade and a corduroy hat from Ralph Lauren.\n\nDesigned by Clio Peppiatt, the black garment was sleeveless, covered in black sparkles, and decorated with silver moons and stars.\n\nSwift wore the minidress with a fuzzy Anine Bing jacket draped over her arms, platform heels, and a silver Aquazzura bag in hand.\n\nAs she left the party, she was also seen wearing a massive teardrop-shaped ring made from opal and blue topaz stones. Though many assumed it was gifted to her by Kelce, it was later revealed to have been a birthday present from Keleigh Teller, Swift's friend and Miles Teller's wife.\n\nSwift stepped out during a September 2024 visit to Electric Lady Studios in New York City in a three-piece outfit from Monse. Inspired by art from the 1950s, each tapestry piece was decorated with images of a landscape and a landing UFO.\n\nThe musician likely chose to wear the $1,490 jacket, $740 corset, and $890 miniskirt as a nod to her song \"Down Bad,\" which uses alien analogies to express her feelings about a breakup.\n\nShe paired the outfit with $1,270 statement boots from Vivienne Westwood, adding a high-fashion touch to the quirky outfit.\n\nWhile out with Kelce in October, Swift was photographed wearing a $1,700 lace-embellished Gucci corset, a $195 faux-leather miniskirt from RTA, and $1,720 Louis Vuitton boots, which are now sold out.\n\nThe three pieces created a feminine and edgy ensemble that also embodied quiet luxury, especially thanks to her accessories.\n\nShe sported a $2,498 Ralph Lauren coat, carried a $4,400 Dior Saddle bag, and accessorized with two expensive rings: a $3,150 gold and diamond band from Louis Vuitton and a $3,490 pear-shaped piece from Shala Karimi.\n\nMost of Swift's street-style looks are classic and subdued. The dress she wore in New York City in November 2024, though, was anything but.\n\nDesigned by Vivienne Westwood, the $2,390 piece had a structured, off-the-shoulder bodice that looked like it had been painted with strokes of yellow, blue, and red. Its puffed skirt, on the other hand, was decorated with uneven blue stripes.\n\nSwift completed the outfit with $795 velvet sandals from Aquazzura, which have since sold out, a vintage necklace from For Future Reference that previously retailed for $12,750, and a $355 Vivienne Westwood purse.\n\nShe was photographed holding hands with Kelce in New York City, where the couple sported coordinated black and red outfits.\n\nSwift's included a $1,095 crystal-covered coat from Simkhai, a $498 minidress from Fleur Du Mal, and Louboutin sandal heels.\n\nShe also wore her signature red lipstick and an assortment of fine jewelry from De Beers.\n\nShe visited New York City with Kelce again, this time wearing a Louis Vuitton sweater tucked into a wrap skirt from the same fashion house.\n\nThe most eye-catching piece of her look, though, was her floral-printed fishnet tights. She wore them beneath $1,940 Louis Vuitton boots.\n\nShe was photographed in New York City wearing a plaid miniskirt from Miu Miu, a dark bodysuit, and a $3,730 Max Mara coat.\n\nHer accessories included suede Louboutin boots, sheer tights, a $1,300 YSL bag, and diamond earrings from Etiq.",

    "fullText": "A far cry from hand-scrawled letters to Santa, on graphic design platform Canva users have created a whopping 1.4m Christmas wishlist presentations\n\nGet our weekend culture and lifestyle email\n\nTwas three weeks before Christmas, when all through the house, not a creature was stirring, except for my 13-year-old daughter, who emerged from her lair with a level of vim uncommon in daylight hours.\n\nAs she made her approach with laptop aglow, her droll little mouth was drawn up in a bow. It then became apparent that I was about to become the audience (some may say “victim”) of a recent cultural phenomenon: the Christmas wishlist slideshow.\n\nGraphic design platform Canva seems to be the tool of choice for many teenagers. Canva say the first Christmas wishlist template was added to their library in 2019. Since 2022, people have created more than 3.35m Christmas wishlist designs. Presentation-style wishlists have jumped 61% between 2024 and 2025, totalling 1.4m. Social media is awash with videos of exuberant adolescents in expensive sweatsuits making family presentations on huge TVs, along with countless tutorials on how to make them “aesthetic” – a word I never tire of reminding my children is a noun, not an adjective.\n\nSuffice to say it was not visions of sugar plums that had been dancing in my daughter’s head. Instead, I was treated to an initial collage of brands and stores that she holds in mysterious esteem, followed by a series of categorised slides covering the teenage perennials: clothes, jewellery, decor, beauty products and, thankfully, some books. While her slideshow featured images, “inspo” and prices, she refrained from the vulgarity of hyperlinks, which, judging by the online evidence, are a common addition. And, I guess, could be handy.\n\nIn my rigorous and highly scientific research (read: texting every parent in my contacts list) it was revealed that girls are the main perpetrators, usually embracing this nouveau custom in their late tweens before growing out of it a few years later. Many who were on the receiving end of these pitches appreciated the initiative and practicality, while at the same time lamenting the creep of bland online “get ready with me” and “unboxing” tropes into family traditions. As one friend, whose two boys had never subjected her to the experience, put it – it sounds a bit like people who spend too much time in office mode, then plan their camping holiday meals in an Excel spreadsheet.\n\nEfficient? Certainly. But is it as adorable as the hand-scrawled, misspelled and glitter-smeared entreaties for Santa’s benevolence we knew and loved? Not quite. But as those sanguine mementoes of her innocence gather dust in a drawer somewhere, I was surprised to appreciate the thought, effort and moderation she applied to her newfangled approach. She even added some “dupe” options “as a backup”. Well played, kid.\n\nWhile it’s hard to feel much seasonal magic emanating from a template-built pitch deck, there’s no denying it beats the look of thinly veiled disappointment when your best attempts fall flat. As my cousin said: “There are times in parenting when you just have to admit defeat and play by the rules of the new guard. God knows there’s only so much pity one can take from their teenager!”\n\nArmed with a mood board of colour palettes, preferred necklines, coveted cosmetics and (weep) a teddy bear, I told her, with confidence, it all looked feasible. Her eyes – how they twinkled! Her dimples, how merry!\n\nAnd there it was anew, that joy parents live for. Now, go to bed, please.",

    "description": "MacKenzie Scott has donated billions to charity after divorcing Jeff Bezos, and her style of giving stands out among major philanthropists.",
    "fullText": "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Scott ended their 25-year marriage in 2019 — and she's become a major philanthropic force in the years since.\n\nOn December 9, Scott announced that she'd donated close to $7.2 billion in the past year, bringing her total giving to more than $26 billion. Scott mentioned the 2025 total, her largest giving announcement to date, in a recent blog post on her philanthropy's site.\n\nThe donations went to colleges and a range of organizations, including ones focused on the environment, women's rights, and economic security.\n\nAs of December 2025, Scott was worth $33.8 billion, according to Forbes, making her one of the world's richest women. Her $38 billion divorce settlement from her split with Bezos kicked off her journey into charitable giving. A regulatory filing showed that Scott sold 42% of her Amazon stake in 2025, totaling roughly $12.6 billion.\n\nScott's giving differs from that of many billionaires. She gives large, unrestricted donations — bucking a common belief that nonprofits can't handle this type of gift.\n\n\"Its breadth and scale are unprecedented for a donor operating outside of a foundation structure,\" Elisha Smith Arrillaga, the VP of research at the Center for Effective Philanthropy, told Business Insider. \"For years, the relative scarcity of meaningfully sized, unrestricted gifts has been a source of frustration for nonprofit leaders.\"\n\nThe size of Scott's gifts enables the nonprofit to do long-term planning. Additionally, Scott forgoes the classic application process, which can be burdensome. Instead, \"her staff takes on the bulk of the vetting,\" Smith Arrillaga said.\n\n\"It's no overstatement to say that MacKenzie Scott has revolutionized philanthropy,\" Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, the CEO of a refugee charity that received a donation from Scott, previously told Business Insider.\n\nJust two months before her divorce, Scott had signed the Giving Pledge initiative, committing to giving away half her wealth. She's given away her money at a faster pace than most other major philanthropists, according to Forbes, donating nearly $2 billion in 2022, almost $2.2 billion in 2023, and around $2 billion in 2024, according to blog posts.\n\nMelinda French Gates, the former wife of Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, said in 2022 she had \"huge respect\" for Scott's \"trust-based\" approach to philanthropy.\n\nHowever, Scott's charitable giving has drawn criticism in the past from one of the world's richest people: Elon Musk.\n\nMusk, who has been a vocal critic of DEI initiatives, criticized Scott in 2024 while replying to another X user's claims that the majority of her chosen charities were organizations that \"deal with issues of race and/or gender.\"\n\nBut the SpaceX founder's comments have appeared to have no effect on Scott's philanthropy, as she's continued to donate to diversity-related causes.",

More than 9 million Australians use Pinterest each month.\n\nWednesday’s report found searches for 1980s luxury soared by 225%, “Scotland Highlands aesthetic” by 465% and “the poet aesthetic” by 175%. “Poetcore” – a key trend for Gen Z and millennials - takes its inspiration from the bookish: turtlenecks, fountain pens, satchels and ties.\n\nDriven by Gen Z and millennials, lace will be in, according to the data, including in doily, bandana and makeup form – as will khaki, field jackets and pleated trousers, aka the “paleontologist aesthetic”.\n\nThey’ll also be working an intergalactic “aliencore aesthetic”.\n\nFor Gen Z and millennials, travel will be adrenaline-seeking; for baby boomers, it will be to places that are “mystical” and “ethereal”. Searches for “Faroe Island aesthetic” almost doubled.\n\nPinterest predicts boomer and Gen X food trends to be cruciferous, with kimchi, dumplings and golumpki soup all raising the cabbage’s status. A younger trend for a “gummy bears aesthetic” goes beyond sweets and into makeup products and rubberised nail art.\n\nAnd “niche perfume collection” is having its moment in the sun, as are “perfume layering combinations”.\n\nPinterest said there was a theme uniting trends as disparate as masquerades and operas, dragonfly wing-patterned nails and animal-inspired outfits, forecasting a move towards individuality and away from imitation.\n\nMelinda Petrunoff, the managing director for Pinterest ANZ, told Guardian Australia that “people are craving comfort, authenticity and grounded optimism in a world that feels increasingly fast and often noisy”.\n\n“What’s driving this is a desire for individuality and self-preservation – people are moving towards curating rather than copying, choosing to engage with what truly resonates with them instead of chasing every viral moment,” she said.\n\n“We’re moving away from one-size-fits-all aesthetics and endless trend cycles that leave people feeling overwhelmed and disconnected.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will road-test his claims that he's tackling Americans' affordability woes at a Tuesday rally in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania — shifting an argument made in Oval Office appearances and social media posts to a campaign-style event.\n\nThe trip comes as polling consistently shows that public trust in Trump's economic leadership has faltered. Following dismal results for Republicans in last month's off-cycle elections, the White House has sought to convince voters that the economy will emerge stronger next year and that any anxieties over inflation have nothing to do with Trump.\n\nThe president has consistently blamed his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, for inflation even as his own aggressive implementation of policies has pushed up prices that had been settling down after spiking in 2022 to a four-decade high. Inflation began to accelerate after Trump announced his sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs in April. Companies warned that the import taxes could be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices and reduced hiring, yet Trump continues to insist that inflation has faded.\n\n“We’re bringing prices way down,\" Trump said at the White House on Monday. “You can call it ‘affordability’ or anything you want — but the Democrats caused the affordability problem, and we’re the ones that are fixing it.”\n\nThe president's reception in the county hosting his Tuesday rally could give a signal of just how much voters trust his claims. Monroe County flipped to Trump in the 2024 election after having backed Biden in 2020, helping the Republican to win the swing state of Pennsylvania and return to the White House after a four-year hiatus.\n\nAs home to the Pocono Mountains, the county has largely relied on tourism for skiing, hiking, hunting and other activities as a source of jobs. Its proximity to New York City — under two hours by car — has also attracted people seeking more affordable housing.\n\nIt's also an area that could help decide control of the House in next year's midterm elections.\n\nTrump is holding his rally in a congressional district held by freshman Republican Rep. Rob Bresnahan, who is a top target of Democrats and won his 2024 race by about 1.5 percentage points, among the nation’s closest. Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti, a Democrat, is running for the nomination to challenge him.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is running digital ads during Trump's visit on the Wilkes-Barre Times-Leader website that criticize Bresnahan for his stock trading while in Congress and suggest that Trump has not as promised addressed double-dealing in Washington.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Susie Wiles said on the online conservative talk show “The Mom View” that Trump would be on the “campaign trail” next year to engage supporters who otherwise might sit out a congressional race.\n\nWiles, who helped manage Trump's 2024 campaign, said most administrations try to localize midterm elections and keep the president out of the race, but she intends to do the opposite of that.\n\n“We’re actually going to turn that on its head,\" Wiles said, \"and put him on the ballot because so many of those low-propensity voters are Trump voters.”\n\nWiles added, “So I haven’t quite broken it to him yet, but he’s going to campaign like it’s 2024 again.”\n\nThe challenge for Trump is how to address the concerns of voters about the economy while simultaneously claiming that the economy is enjoying an historic boom.\n\nAsked on a Politico podcast about how he'd rate the economy, Trump leaned into the grade inflation by answering “A-plus,” only to then amend his answer to “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.”\n\nTrump has said he's giving consumers relief by relaxing fuel efficiency standards for autos and signing agreements to reduce list prices on prescription drugs.\n\nTrump has also advocated for cuts to the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate — which influences the supply of money in the U.S. economy. He argues that would reduce the cost of mortgages and auto loans, although critics warn that cuts of the scale sought by Trump could instead worsen inflation.\n\nThe U.S. economy has shown signs of resilience with the stock market up this year and overall growth looking solid for the third quarter. But many Americans see the prices of housing, groceries, education, electricity and other basic needs as swallowing up their incomes, a dynamic that the Trump administration has said it expects to fade next year with more investments in artificial intelligence and manufacturing.\n\nSince the elections in November when Democrats won key races with a focus on kitchen table issues, Trump has often dismissed the concerns about prices as a “hoax” and a “con job” to suggest that he bears no responsibility for inflation, even though he campaigned on his ability to quickly bring down prices. Just 33% of U.S. adults approve of Trump's handling of the economy, according to a November survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nLevy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",

    "description": "Dakota Johnson's fashion is effortlessly chic. It's also pretty daring. This year, she's worn a mix of both styles on and off the red carpet.",
    "fullText": "She wore classic black Gucci trousers with sharp pleats, a semi-sheer white blouse, and shiny black loafers from the Italian fashion house.\n\nThough understated, her outfit was expensive. Her shoes cost $1,050, and her pants cost $2,500.\n\nShe wore a chic $2,980 black midi dress from Khaite on the event's red carpet, which highlighted her accessories.\n\nThe latter included $1,140 haircalf heels from the clothing brand, a $2,350 Métier bag, $695 Sophie Buhai earrings, and two onyx rings from the same designer, which cost $2,050 each.\n\nInside the gala, she wore a white trench coat with thick buckles on top.\n\nShe wore a sheer Balenciaga bodysuit on one occasion, but covered it with a leather duster jacket.\n\nShe also sported black Balenciaga jeans, $990 Khaite wedges, The Row's $2,600 Mira clutch, an assortment of Yvonne Leon diamond jewelry, and $590 sunglasses from Khaite's collaboration with Oliver Peoples.\n\nShe wore a $5,200 sleeveless black Gucci dress with a deeply scooped neckline and a crystal hook across the back for the May event.\n\nThe outfit was pretty plain, but elevated thanks to her $1,120 Gucci heels, diamond stud earrings, and a $12,750 Boucheron ring.\n\nJohnson wore a Ferragamo fit that day to deliver an acting masterclass. It included a $1,750 scarf-embellished top, a miniskirt, and sheer tights.\n\nHer $2,900 boots, though, were the most daring piece of the ensemble. Designed by Yves Saint Laurent, the leather shoes featured 6.1-inch block heels and platforms across the toes.\n\nShe arrived at the event in a custom YSL slip dress with an orange floral print. The garment was understated by Johnson's standards, though her jewelry was anything but.\n\nShe wore $115,000 Boucheron earrings made from diamonds and white gold. The statement pieces were shaped like leaves.\n\nHer dress, a $2,450 piece from Mugler, was strapless with a plunging V-shaped neckline and a long, ankle-length skirt.\n\nTo complement the gown's daring cut, Johnson wore a diamond necklace with an emerald charm from Roberto Coin and a matching emerald ring.\n\nShe completed the look for the July event with $795 Gianvito Rossi pumps.\n\nJohnson mostly wore gowns throughout 2025, but she made an exception for the \"Splitsville\" premiere after-party.\n\nThat night, she wore a green Gucci minidress covered in sequins, paired with the fashion house's pointed black pumps.\n\nWhile walking around New York City, Johnson was photographed wearing a $98 semi-sheer Commando bodysuit beneath a yellow velvet jacket from Khaite.\n\nShe also wore simple blue jeans, $990 Khaite wedges in black, and dark Gucci sunglasses.\n\nThe daring aspect came in the form of her jewelry, which retails for a combined total of over $140,000. Johnson wore a $10,430 Ophelia Eve emerald necklace and a $130,200 Sophie Bille Brahe piece.\n\nInstead, she wore a strapless, seafoam gown from Valentino. The floor-length piece was crafted from textured fabric and featured a gathered waistline.\n\nThough its silhouette was straightforward, its color was a bold choice for the actor, which paid off.\n\nShe completed the look with jewels from Jessica McCormack.\n\nShe wore a strapless, form-fitting gown from Gucci in a striking silver color.\n\nIt contrasted her dark hair and was accessorized to perfection with statement earrings and bangles, all from Roberto Coin.\n\nHer Valentino gown had a halter neckline, a black mesh panel beneath its beaded top, and a floor-length skirt.\n\nThe dress was eye-catching and intricate in design.\n\nFor the \"Highest 2 Lowest\" premiere, Johnson walked the red carpet in a strapless Gucci gown covered with pink fringe. The vibrant color choice was a departure from her usual neutral fashion.\n\nShe also wore massive Boucheron earrings crafted from diamonds, which sparkled in the light.\n\nShe looked stunning in a strapless maxi gown from Ferragamo, which retails for $1,850, and pumps from the same brand.\n\nThe star of the show, however, was her $1.2 million Roberto Coin necklace. The eye-catching piece was crafted from diamonds, sapphires, and white gold, and it matched her $25,000 blue ring.\n\nShe wore the pieces shortly after being named the Italian jewelry brand's latest ambassador.\n\nAlessandra Rich designed her cutout dress with a strapless, plunging V-shaped neckline. It also had two waist cutouts and a daring slit in the middle of its skirt.\n\nJust as bold as the dress was Johnson's selection of jewelry. She wore sparkling rings, earrings, and layered necklaces that covered part of her collarbones and chest.\n\nGucci custom-made her sleeveless gown, which was semi-sheer and lined with a strapless leotard.\n\nShe paired the dress with an updo hairstyle and $56,000 Boucheron hoop earrings.\n\nDesigned by Gucci, the black gown had one long sleeve, an asymmetrical neckline, and fabric hanging down the front and back of her body.\n\nOn the sides, though, it was only held together by the brand's signature horsebit hooks. The latter detail revealed her legs and hips as she walked.\n\nHer Ferragamo ensemble included a $1,490 asymmetrical miniskirt and a $2,900 blazer with a curved neckline that dipped beneath her chest.\n\nShe completed the look with sheer black tights and the brand's $980 pumps.\n\nAfter a rumored breakup between Johnson and Chris Martin, the actor was photographed wearing a $775 tulle-wrapped bodysuit and a matching $1,366 sheer skirt from Nensi Dojaka.\n\nThe outfit was dramatic, fashionable, and undoubtedly one of her most daring looks of the year.\n\nChloé designed her billowing gown, which had short tiered sleeves, a deep V-neckline, and a floor-length skirt. The latter and the bodice were both see-through.\n\nThe outfit was daring, as is Johnson's signature, but it was also feminine and timeless.\n\nThat outfit, of course, was her blue Gucci ball gown. It featured a lace bodice with long sleeves, a high neckline, and a full tulle skirt.\n\nThe dress was as vibrant as it was daring. Johnson wore nothing beneath its see-through top.\n\nShe arrived at Kering's Caring for Women dinner wearing a high-neck, long-sleeved dress crafted from sparkling floral lace. The form-fitting Gucci piece sat atop two pieces of black lingerie.\n\nTo complete the look, Johnson added emerald earrings that matched the color of her eyes.",
