    "title": "A LEGO-style replica of JPMorgan's new 270 Park skyscraper has an internal waitlist and is listed for $500 on eBay",
    "description": "JPMorgan workers can join a waitlist and follow multi-step instructions to buy a toy replica of the new building, which is already reselling for $500.",
    "fullText": "For JPMorgan employees, taking your work home just got a lot more literal.\n\nEmployees who got on an internal waitlist can purchase a $150 LEGO-style replica of the bank's new, $3 billion headquarters at 270 Park Avenue, according to screenshots of waitlist instructions reviewed by Business Insider. A source familiar with the product said the replica sets at the headquarters' internal gift shop sold out quickly when the building first opened. Representatives for JPMorgan declined to comment.\n\nThe bank has been a leader in Wall Street's return-to-office push, and the new building has cemented its commitment to in-person work in the country's financial capital. The scramble for a miniature version of the headquarters also shows how much buzz it's generated. 270 Park Avenue has taken on a life of its own — tourists will stop to take photos in front of the skyscraper, and TikTok is full of videos about the amenities\n\nBuying the toy is no simple process — employees had to get on the waitlist for the 1,903-piece set before February 9. Starting after 10 am on February 26, those on the coveted list had 72 hours to pick up their replica from the shop, which offers everything from JPMorgan merchandise to trendy olive oil.\n\nOnly the employee on the waitlist can pick up the set during the 72-hour window, and they have to show either their JPMorgan ID, a state-issued ID, or their passport. As of now, there are enough replicas for everyone on the waitlist, and any extra sets will be sold on a first-come, first-served basis after March 10.\n\nYet hope will remain for those who miss their waitlist window and don't snag one of the leftovers, since the waitlist will reopen after April 1, according to the screenshots. Appearances aside, the building isn't an official LEGO product, but rather made out of repackaged and \"re-used LEGO elements,\" the box specifies.\n\nThe resale market is already capitalizing on JPMorgan fervor: someone is selling what appears to be the toy for $500 on eBay. The product is 6.5 x 16.3 inches, according to the post, compared to the actual skyscraper's height of 1,388 feet. Multiple platforms, including Walmart and Amazon, are selling dupes of the duped building, though those toys have 3,180 pieces and a slightly altered design.\n\nJPMorgan's new headquarters boasts a suite of offerings beyond repurposed LEGO bricks. The building, which opened in October and can house around 14,000 employees, has an array of restaurants, a pub, a gym, and an ever-waving American flag, to name just a few amenities.\n\nWith its LED lighting display, the 60-story building has changed Manhattan's skyline, easy to spot from across the boroughs. Now, it's moving beyond architecture and subtly changing interior design for those few who can get their hands on the replica.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Here are the most stylish luxury totes actually worth the splurge, tested by our style editors over years of commutes, plane rides, and everyday life.",
    "fullText": "Any I step outside my apartment, I'm wearing a tote under my arm. You just never know when one quick errand is going to turn into a full day of shopping, catching up with friends, or traveling to the other side of town to satiate a random craving.\n\nI, along with my fellow style editors, have tested a ton of tote bags — like, a ton — but the best luxury totes have an edge over your typical carryall. Beyond acting as a way to carry your laptop, water bottle, and other daily essentials, they elevate your routine with thoughtful design details and quality materials that get better over time.\n\nA luxury tote is worth investing in because they let you take your whole life with you in style. The spacious interior comes in handy whether you're commuting to the office, making a quick trip to the store, or even flying overseas.\n\nIn this guide, we've rounded up our favorite luxury totes that combine lasting quality, intuitive pocket placement, and sophisticated style — the ones that truly justify the splurge. From sculptural suede to slouchy carryalls, here are the very best luxury totes we use for accessorizing with intention.\n\nThe Cuyana Easy Tote is a prime example of quiet luxury. It has a simple exterior, but after years of wear, the smooth, luxe Italian leather carryall has proven itself to be an utter classic.\n\nIt softens and develops character with regular use, making it the ideal investment piece for lowering its cost-per-wear. The unstructured silhouette adapts to whatever you carry — from a laptop and notebook to a water bottle and essentials — without looking bulky or awkward. Even better, the dual handle lengths let you carry it by hand or comfortably over your shoulder (even with a puffy coat on).\n\n\"Cuyana also makes several accessories, like the Classic Tote Insert, for organizing the interior of your bag,\" writes executive editor Sally Kaplan. \"These are great if you like a bit more structure or interior protection since the soft Italian leather is unlined inside. \n\n\"I've had my bag for about 4 years now and I've taken it on every vacation, flight, weekend trip, and long car ride in that time,\" she continues. \"It fits an unbelievable amount of stuff, but it also doesn't look floppy or silly if I just put a few things in it.\"\n\nThis kind of longevity, in addition to the refined minimalist design and pared-back hardware, makes Cuyana's Easy Tote a stylish option that you're bound to get plenty of use from.\n\nRead \n\nI know the KAAI Pyramid is a coveted design because I've seen it often imitated, but never duplicated. In my years of testing fine leather goods, I've never felt a smoother suede than the blue lining of this luxury tote. It serves as the ultimate protection against scratches for my laptop, and puts this structured design in a league of its own.\n\nWhat sets the Pyramid apart is how well it performs both on my commute and at the office. The scratch-resistant, water-resilient leather stays looking sharp through the hustle and bustle, and it usually earns me a compliment in the elevator.\n\nIt's also easy to keep organized, thanks to the interior slip pockets for easy-access essentials, and the fully zipped top makes me feel more secure wearing it on the subway. A nice little touch are the metal feet at the bottom, so I can set it down without the bottom getting dirty.\n\nIt also comes in multiple sizes, from the full-size tote to a Midi and Mini version — in case you have a lighter everyday carry but still want the same look.\n\nOverall, the KAAI Pyramid Tote is a splurge-worthy blend of modern style, substance, and enduring quality — a bag that feels expensive because of how it's made, not because of flashy logos. It's apparent the moment you pick it up.\n\nRead \n\nTumi is one of our favorite splurge-worthy luggage brands our team has tested. Its Contine Weekender manages to fit as much as a duffel and still feels comfortable to carry like a tote.\n\nThe sleek design comes with a ton of organizational features. \"A padded laptop pocket, a spacious shoe compartment, a water bottle holder, and an exterior zip pocket with card slots are just a few of this bag's ample pockets that proved convenient for organizing all my bits and bobs,\" writes style contributor Talia Ergas.\n\nAs a bonus, the shoe compartment is convertible. You can unzip its barrier and turn into a more spacious tote, allowing more room for a bulky makeup bag or puffy jacket.\n\n\"I'd use this bag for work trips or to take to more upscale destinations,\" she continues. \"The bag doesn't come cheap, but it's built to last: My husband has used his Tumi weekender tote for well over a decade (though his specific style has since been discontinued).\"\n\nRead \n\nThe MZ Wallace Metro Tote is made with a featherlight quilted nylon and comes with padded, reinforced handles, which really makes a difference on the shoulders after carrying this tote for a full day.\n\n\"It's easy to convert this tote from a shoulder bag to a crossbody because of the removable strap, and with so many pockets and colors to choose from it's just as practical as it is stylish,\" writes style contributor Rebecca Strong.\n\nLet's talk about those pockets: There are six on the inside and five on the outside, with still room left over for a 13-inch MacBook. \"I never have to worry about digging into the depths of my bag to find my phone charger, lip balm, or whatever else I might need at any given moment,\" adds Rebecca.\n\nGiven the softshell fabric, you can also easily pack the MZ Wallace Metro Tote flat and it won't take up too much space in your carry-on. If you do wear it to the airport, though, you'll be glad to find that its luggage sleeve conveniently slides over your suitcase handle.\n\nRead \n\nI'm sure I don't need to tell you that Coach is a reputable brand, since most people I know have seen a Coach bag up close at some point or another. But since the brand's Tabby has come back in such a big way, I want to give the Brooklyn 39 its flowers — because sometimes you need a rather large unlined leather hobo bag, in case you come home with souvenirs.\n\nThis luxury tote has that trendy oversized shape, which lends well if you're bad at packing light (like me). Crafted from Coach’s signature pebble leather, the bag has a relaxed feel, yet the slightly shiny finish makes it polished enough for formal settings. It's a stylish accessory on the weekend, but serves its purpose as a catch-all when you need it to.\n\nThe strong, malleable leather means you can stuff it to the brim with a laptop, bulky sweater, or 40-ounce water bottle, and it won't protest with any creases or cracks. \"The Brooklyn 39 is so roomy that I call it my Mary Poppins bag,\" says style editor Samantha Crozier. \"For people who like to take an extra pair of shoes to work, this will absolutely hold your heels while you commute in sneakers.\"\n\nThis is one of the most expensive options you'll find in this guide, but the price is justified by just how much stuff this Parker Thatch tote can handle. The huge main compartment and distressed leather means you don't have to be precious about avoiding scuffs or scratches, as other luxury totes demand.\n\n\"I've stuffed it with groceries, spilled iced tea on it, and carried it in the rain with no fear,\" writes style editor Samantha Crozier. \"And after every mishap, the Jack still looks great with its lived-in leather. It's hard to explain how relieving this cognitive shift is, but it's made me reach for this bag all the time.\"\n\nThe Jack immediately feels like a trusty tote you've had for years. With the soft, loosely structured shape and wide opening, you can toss in your everyday carry along with the kids' favorite stuffed animals, a backup pair of shoes, and that package you've been meaning to drop off at the post office. \n\nWhile it doesn't zip shut, you can still tie it closed to retain the boxy shape. Inside is a zippered pocket so you can avoid digging around for your wallet, and the D-rings next to the long drop handles let you add a crossbody strap or decorative key chains.\n\nWhen you add a belt to a luxury tote, you immediately have my attention. I love to see the accessories-wearing-accessories trend in an elevated fashion, so with all the recent press around the Kennedy family, it's a timely opportunity to sport this Tory Burch tote — named after the former president's sister-in-law, style icon Lee Radziwill. \n\nBesides its aesthetic value, the double faced design gives it a practical edge. These outer layers provide even more storage on the outside for dropping in your sunglasses or keys, and they snap shut so the profile stays slim. Inside, the main compartment flares at the base so you can comfortably fit your laptop, toiletry bag, and other essentials within its smooth, suede lining. Leave the belt undone for an intentional devil-may-care effect, or wear it clasped shut to add some structure.\n\nThe price tag is definitely considerable, but true purse girls know the Lee Radzwill line is a major component of Tory Burch's design archive. And if you're going to spend nearly a grand on a luxury tote, isn't it nice for it to have some cultural significance, too?\n\nIf I had to sum up my personal style, I'd call it \"alternative with a corporate job.\" The Hammitt Oliver Zip Tote fits that aesthetic. It's crafted with a buttery soft pebbled leather that feels soft on my skin, so it's comfortable to wear tucked underarm. \n\nHammitt's signature gunmetal rivets give it an edge over mainstream designer bags, yet it still has all the practical details one could want in a tote. For me, that includes a zippered top, exterior slip pocket for my phone, a key leash, and an interior drop pocket for small essentials like my wallet and lip balm.\n\nThe softly structured leather makes this the carry-all ideal for carrying bulky items like books, a toiletry bag, or a light jacket. If you're into the prim-and-proper tote with rigid corners and brassy hardware, look elsewhere. But if you want something that complements your all-black wardrobe and still looks polished, the Oliver is a dependable option.\n\nThis chic, tulip-shaped design from Parisian luxury brand Polène is one I keep seeing worn by stylish passengers on the train. When you untuck the petals it takes on a whole new shape, giving you a versatile luxury tote you can wear two ways.\n\nThe main design drawbacks of the Cyme Tote are its open top and the smooth, coated leather, which is prone to scratches if you're not careful. \"The bag does come with a zippered pouch that you can fasten to the interior, though,\" notes style editor Samantha Crozier, \"so when I take it on the subway, I keep my phone, keys, and wallet in the pouch and leave non-valuables like a sweater, a book, and a water bottle on the outside.\"\n\nAs with any trendy luxury tote, I've seen affordable alternatives pop up that sort of resemble its sculptural shape, only they lack the expensive-looking sheen of Polène's Italian and Spanish leather. The genuine article also has hanging tassels, contrast stitching, and two sets of handles, which let you tote it by hand or over your shoulder.\n\nGabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor: I've spent almost three years testing fine leather goods on the style team at BI Reviews, from legacy brand ballet flats to lesser-known designer handbags. I've found the quality of a leather tote is best proven over time, once the material either ages gracefully with soft signs of wear, or comes apart due to shoddy construction.\n\nBased on my discussions with industry experts, trend research, and an involuntary personal habit of clocking labels all over New York City, I curated this list to include luxury totes that balance functionality with sophisticated style.\n\nRead how the Reviews team tests clothing, shoes, and accessories at Business Insider.\n\nLuxury totes are built with quality materials and craftsmanship that you both feel and see — from full-grain leather that develops a rich patina over time, to reinforced stitching that holds up to stains and strains. Cheaper totes often use lower-grade leather or synthetics that can crack, peel or sag.\n\nBelieve me: I've collected my fair share of canvas totes, and they each served me well — until the rips, stains, wrinkles were too obvious to ignore, and a permanent leather tote made the most sense for someone like me who carries a tote everyday. The durable nature of the material lasts longer, and you can easily find a luxury leather tote with a laid-back style to suit quick errands (such as the Parker Thatch Jack).\n\nLook for luxury totes made in a tannery with a Gold rating from the Leather Working Group. It means the manufacturer is doing the important work of conserving energy, using fewer chemicals deemed harmful for the environment, and maintaining records on the source of its raw materials.\n\nThe grade of leather — whether top-grain, full-grain, or pebbled Italian leather — determines how it changes color, how it feels on your skin, and how well it maintains its structure. Luxury totes are typically made with higher-grade leather that resists scratches, instead developing a lovely patina.\n\nCost-per-wear is calculated by the purchase price divided by how often you use your luxury tote. If you carry yours everyday — and those days become weeks — it quickly increases in value, because the cost spreads out over hundreds of wears. This (eventually) justifies the the initial investment.\n\nSome do, if they become collectors items or come in a classic silhouette that transcends the ever-shortening trend cycle. It also depends on how well you preserve the quality of the luxury tote. Use a leather conditioner and store it in a dust bag away from direct sunlight. This not only makes it last longer, but gives you the option to have it appraised in the future.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

    "description": "Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan have been together since college in the early 2000s. A lot has changed since then, including their style.",
    "fullText": "For example, they kept their outfits simple on the red carpet for the 2014 Breakthrough Prize ceremony.\n\nZuckerberg wore a black tuxedo and satin tie, while Chan sported a sparkling, sleeveless dress in a deep shade of blue.\n\nFor a state dinner that year, Zuckerberg sported his usual black suit, tie, and dress shoes.\n\nChan, on the other hand, looked elegant in a vibrant red dress with a lace overlay. She paired the garment with a black clutch, simple sandals, and an updo hairstyle.\n\nZuckerberg continued attending events like the 2016 Axel Springer Awards in dark suits and white undershirts. Rather than accessorizing, he added only belts and dress shoes.\n\nChan, on the other hand, began sporting all-black ensembles that year. For the awards ceremony, she donned black leggings underneath a knit tunic and ankle-length boots.\n\nFor the annual Breakthrough Prize ceremony, Zuckerberg wore a black tuxedo with sharp, satin lapels and his signature tie.\n\nChan dazzled alongside him, wearing a black sleeveless dress beneath a glitter-covered fishnet overlay with a high neckline and long sleeves.\n\nThey both walked the Breakthrough Prize red carpet in black suit jackets, with Chan wearing hers over a solid black gown.\n\nZuckerberg swapped his usual necktie for a bow tie.\n\nThe couple attended the 2024 UFC 300 event in April while wearing casual yet cool outfits. Zuckerberg wore a white T-shirt with black jeans, and Chan donned a black blazer as a dress with sunglasses and a gold necklace for accessories.\n\nThen, in May, Zuckerberg celebrated his birthday while wearing a graphic tee and a gold chain.\n\nZuckerberg's fashion changes might have been strategic. Meta announced in 2024 that it was working to win over Gen Z.\n\nThe Facebook founder could have been doing the same by upping his style reputation.\n\nZuckerberg, who matched fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos at the event, wore a navy suit, white button-down shirt, and deep red tie.\n\nChan, however, made a high-fashion statement with a baby-blue Bottega Veneta set. She wore a $2,500 wool cardigan, a matching $2,800 skirt, and chunky pearl necklaces.\n\nZuckerberg opted for an all-black outfit instead of a standard tuxedo. He wore a pleated button-down shirt, a matching jacket, dark trousers, shining dress shoes, and a pair of Meta AI Ray-Ban glasses, which cost between $299 and $549.\n\nChan took a bolder approach, incorporating various pieces from designer brands.\n\nShe tucked a white T-shirt into Alaïa's $11,400 black bubble skirt, draped an oversized blazer over both, and accessorized with a $2,000 Magda Butrym bag.\n\nShe also wore $1,200 lambskin and leather mules from Alaïa and a black-and-white snake necklace made from diamonds.\n\nWhile Zuckerberg wore a black tuxedo with matching dress shoes and a tie, Chan walked the event's purple carpet in a black-and-white gown.\n\nThe strapless piece had a statement bow at the waist, a pleat down its bodice, and a short cape attached to its back. She wore it with black heels and a serpent-shaped necklace covered in diamonds.\n\nTogether, the couple sat in the audience of Prada's runway show, wearing a mix of fashion staples from the Italian designer.\n\nZuckerberg's outfit included brown trousers and a tan, long-sleeved, collared shirt, while Chan's ensemble featured a thick black skirt, a gray sweater, and red socks.\n\nBoth wore chunky Prada loafers and small jewelry pieces for the fashion show.",

    "title": "These $80 packable sneakers from Reef are my holy grail travel shoes",
    "description": "I'm a travel writer, so I rely on packable shoes that can go the extra mile. The Reef Neptune sneakers check all my boxes for comfort, fit, and style.",
    "fullText": "I've never been much of a sneaker gal. As someone who lives in a year-round warm-weather climate, I'm more comfortable wearing sandals. That was until I started having foot tingling and pain.\n\nEager for a solution, I looked for shoes that would provide support, but look cuter than the chunky running sneakers I wear to work out. And, as a travel writer who takes several trips a year, I needed something close-toed that would be easy to pack, comfortable while sprinting through airports, and can hold up to 20,000-step days.\n\nThe Reef Neptune sneaker ticked all my boxes. Lightweight, ultra breathable, stylish, and with incredible arch support, they've now become my everyday walking shoe. \n\nThe best part is that they pack down flat, taking up just as much room in my luggage as a pair of sandals. But they're so dreamy to wear, you're more likely to find them on my feet than stuffed into my suitcase.\n\nA lightweight sneaker made with a breathable mesh knit, this shoe has a plush memory foam sole that’s comfortable from the first wear (and hundreds of miles later).\n\nThe sneakers' crushable, fold-down heel design makes slipping them on and off a cinch. This especially comes in handy when I'm running out the door to pick up my kids or in a busy airport security line and kicking myself for forgetting to add my TSA precheck number.\n\nThe Reef Neptunes are wildly comfortable from the very first wear. The ultra-soft memory foam insole and cushioned footbed remind me more of a plush slipper than a sneaker. They took no time to break in, and I can still feel the enhanced arch support hugging the soles of my feet, even after months of regular wear.\n\nThey're an approachable style with a true-to-size fit and middle-of-the-road width. I wear a size 8 sneaker and they fit perfectly, with no tightness in the toe box. The breathable, stretchy mesh sides will surely benefit wider feet, though sizing up a half size is always an option. If your feet run narrow, Reef suggests sizing down a half size for a snugger fit.\n\nAt $80, I think they're very reasonably priced. Especially compared to similar name-brand offerings — Allbirds' Tree Runner, for example, costs $20 more. Vivaia's All Day slip-on mesh sneaker commands $159.\n\nFor what it's worth, I've owned Reef's Ginger Flip Flops since the early 2000s. I consistently find this brands' shoes to be reliably well made, durable, and long lasting.\n\nThe biggest drawback I've experienced is how easily they stain. I deliberately chose gray instead of the white for this reason, but they still became dirty pretty quickly.\n\nTo clean them, I first remove the insoles, then combine warm water with a bit of dish soap and gentle detergent so I can brush away stains with a toothbrush. I soak the laces in the same solution, and use a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser to remove scuff marks. Then, I stuff them with paper towels and let them air dry for 24 hours. Voila, good as new.\n\nSimply put, I've never worn a more comfortable sneaker. The fact that these shoes look good with everything, pack down ultra light, and remain comfy through miles of walking, has made them a true VIP in my closet (and suitcase).\n\nThat said, I did find it frustrating how easily they dirtied. In hindsight, I would've picked a darker color, and moving forward, I plan to clean them more regularly rather than wait for them to turn dark and dingy.\n\nStill, the Reef Neptune is a stylish, affordable option that travels well and might be as close as I'll ever come to walking on air. I'm not sure I can do much better than that.\n\nLearn how the Reviews team tests clothing, shoes and accessories at Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Mark Zuckerberg's style era has hit a new high.\n\nThe Meta CEO was spotted in the front row at Prada's Fall/Winter runway presentation on Thursday, alongside his wife, Priscilla Chan. The pair wore understated sweaters to the show, but the logo on their shoes couldn't be missed.\n\nThey wore coordinated pairs of Prada loafers, with Chan in brown leather and Zuckerberg in classic black. Prada lists similar shoe styles on its website for $1,290 to $1,420.\n\nIt's common for front row attendees to wear the label, and Chan and Zuckerberg don't appear to be breaking that trend. It's unclear whether they were dressed by Prada for the show or wore looks from their own closets.\n\nMeta and Prada didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nA post shared by Mark Zuckerberg (@zuck)\n\n\"Thanks to Prada for having us in Milan!\" Zuckerberg captioned an Instagram post about the event.\n\nThe couple sat a few seats down from Vogue magazine boss and fashion legend Anna Wintour as they all clapped for the brand's presentation at Milan Fashion Week.\n\nZuckerberg has spent recent years solidifying himself as a fashion influencer for tech bros. From flashy watches to gold chains, his style has been a topic of discussion alongside his achievements at Meta.\n\nThe tech giant has ventured into the fashion world with its smart glasses, released in partnership with brands like Oakley and Ray-Ban, through a deal with eyewear company EssilorLuxottica. In June, CNBC reported that Meta would add Prada to its lineup of AI-powered glasses.\n\nZuckerberg wasn't spotted wearing Meta's signature specs while sitting front row.",

    "fullText": "The Premier League will launch its first direct-to-customer streaming platform in Singapore next season, and is looking to see how it could be “replicated all around the world” if successful.\n\nThe English football league’s chief executive Richard Masters announced the project on Thursday, making long-standing rumours of a ‘Premflix’-style service a reality, at least in one territory.\n\nMasters said the service would be branded as Premier League Plus and that the league would be closely monitoring its success to determine whether to expand further.\n\nIt is the Premier League’s first move to broadcast its own content, having always previously sold its rights to independent broadcasters such as Sky Sports in England and NBC in the United States.\n\nIt will coincide with the opening of a new Premier League Studios production hub in Olympia in London.\n\nMasters officially announced the news at the Financial Times Business of Football Summit in London on Thursday.\n\n“We’re going (direct) to consumer in Singapore. It’s a very long, considered process, carefully chosen,” he said.\n\n“So from next season, Premier League Plus, rather than Premflix – we’ve rebranded it finally – is going to happen.\n\n“For the first time the Premier League is going to have its own customers. It’s going to have to deal with promotion, pricing, churn, distribution, all of those things, we’re looking to build a business.\n\n“We’re also looking to learn, to see how that might be replicated all around the world.\n\n“What we do with Premier League Plus in Singapore is really about learning as well as building the business. If it goes well, it may be replicated. You don’t want to predict further than that I think at this stage.”\n\nThe Premier League’s move follows other major sports leagues, including the NFL, NBA and Major League Baseball in North America, in going direct to consumer.",

Red was also donned by “his top advisers, including White House chief of staff Susie Wiles.”\n\nPolitics: 'Downright Clown Car': 2028 Democratic Field Is A 'Total Mess,' CNN's Harry Enten Says\n\nThe Mirror said Barron’s tie was “eyebrow-raising,” “surprising” and “interesting.”\n\nThe Express pointed out the “unconventional” garment that “sparked conversation.”\n\n“This choice surprised many viewers watching from home, who had anticipated that Barron would wear red to show solidarity with his father and the Republican Party,” according to the newspaper, which shared a few negative responses to his ensemble on X.\n\nBut if young Trump was committing a fashion faux pas, Vice President JD Vance was guilty of it, too. He wore a light blue tie.\n\nLike this article? Keep independent journalism alive.

    "description": "Gucci faced criticism over AI-generated ads ahead of Milan Fashion Week, highlighting the tension between luxury craftsmanship and modern tech use.",
    "fullText": "Gucci's new AI-generated ads have hit a nerve online.\n\nThe renderings — including a glamorous woman in a fur coat striding through a restaurant, a pair of models some commentators likened to \"Grand Theft Auto\" characters, and sleek car scenes — were posted on Gucci's social media pages ahead of creative director Demna Gvasalia's first runway show at Milan Fashion Week on Friday.\n\nThe images quickly drew sharp criticism online, with some users calling them \"cheap\" and \"slop\"— a term used to describe AI-generated content perceived as low-quality or mass-produced.\n\n\"You did not need to use AI for this, so tacky,\" one Instagram user said. Another user wrote: \"Craftsmanship reduced to marketing narrative.\" One user on X said AI makes the brand look cheaper than TJ Maxx.\n\nA post shared by GUCCI (@gucci)\n\nNot all of the images for the \"Primavera\" campaign are AI-generated — it also includes a mix of other photography.\n\nGucci did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBranding experts say that while some consumers perceive the images as \"cheap,\" Gucci's decision to use AI was likely driven by creative intent rather than cost-cutting.\n\nIt's about \"positioning Gucci at the intersection of fashion, art and technology,\" Blanca Zugaza Escribano, a fashion and luxury strategy consultant at Metyis, told Business Insider.\n\nThe use of AI fits into Gucci's history of experimentation and boundary-pushing, she said.\n\n\"It signals creative futurism, reinforces the brand's relevance in a tech-driven world, and allows it to generate surreal, high-impact imagery that traditional production might not easily achieve,\" she added.\n\nPRIMAVERAFebruary 272 p.m. CETCreated with AI pic.twitter.com/sNbcFrpTX9\n\nThis isn't the first time the Italian luxury fashion house has dipped its toes into AI.\n\nEarlier this month, Gucci partnered with Snapchat for an AI interactive lens — a feature that enables Snapchat users to become one of Gucci's \"La Famiglia\" figures. These were fictional digital characters created for one of its collection rollouts.\n\nArmelle Poulou, CFO of Kering — Gucci's parent company — said in its fourth-quarter earnings call that the launch of the \"La Famiglia\" Collection, and its \"surrounding activations,\" are putting \"Gucci back at the center of the attention.\"\n\nThat push for visibility comes at a critical moment for the brand.\n\nGucci had the steepest revenue decline among Kering's portfolio, falling 22% on a reported basis and 19% on a comparable basis in its full-year 2025 earnings.\n\nMatthew Drinkwater, the director of the Fashion Innovation Agency at the London College of Fashion, said luxury has traditionally been rooted in \"craft, heritage and human storytelling.\"\n\n\"If AI is used in a way that feels like it replaces craft, it risks undermining the very thing that creates aspiration,\" he said.\n\nThis isn't the first time Gucci has been accused of diluting the brand image. While its push for maximalism and logos more than doubled its revenue between 2015 and 2022 —under creative director Alessandro Michele — when consumers turned to the \"quiet luxury\" trend, it was unable to keep up.\n\nAlongside mass-market partnerships, the fashion house's customer base had also become younger and more aspirational, many of whom seem to have moved on.\n\nGucci isn't the only brand to face backlash for its use of AI in marketing. In December, fashion house Valentino raised eyebrows after launching an AI-generated campaign for its DeVain handbag.\n\nA post shared by Valentino (@maisonvalentino)\n\n\"Ruining a fashion house legacy is tough work, but I see you guys have determination,\" one user on Instagram said of Valentino's campaign at the time.\n\nFor luxury brands, the challenge of delivering a positive tech experience is even greater, said Elaine Parr, a senior partner and consumer products and retail industries leader EMEA at IBM.\n\nNot only is it a \"tough market\" for luxury right now as a pullback in spending from aspirational shoppers weighs on sales, but \"you need to deliver on the Lux brand promise and be modern whilst retaining your heritage,\" Parr added.\n\nThe Instagram comments section of luxury brands has become \"the most honest focus group in fashion,\" said Drinkwater, the director of the Fashion Innovation Agency at the London College of Fashion.\n\n\"Almost any use of AI in fashion still seems to trigger a level of outrage,\" he added.\n\nDrinkwater said that while AI is more effective when it supports a creative vision rather than replaces it, negative campaign reactions \"are good examples of how quickly the conversation can turn when people feel craft or human input is being displaced.\"",

    "description": "BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team explains the number of fashion trends that have taken place in football.",
    "fullText": "Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye caught the eye again when he wore a pair of bright white leggings for Monday's Premier League match against Manchester United.\n\nIt's certainly not the first time a player has stood out because of their kit choice.\n\nSome of those decisions are because of warmth and comfort - and some are for marginal gains.\n\nBut what are some of football's newer fashion choices - and how acceptable do we think they are to fans?\n\nUndershorts and undershirts are a familiar sight, but full-length leggings like those worn by Gueye are much more unusual.\n\nThe leggings, which must match the colour of the shorts on top, are primarily worn for an additional layer of warmth and - in some cases - comfort.\n\nManchester United legend Ryan Giggs once wore black support leggings as he returned from hamstring injury.\n\nIn principle, the idea of outfield players wearing gloves is fine. But there are certain circumstances when it has been questionable.\n\nIn 1999, Nicolas Anelka scored twice for France during a match against England... while wearing a pair of goalkeeper gloves.\n\nFurther back, in the 1980s former Nottingham Forest defender John Metgod wore brown gloves that looked more suited to gardening than the football pitch.\n\nFor purists, the jury is out on whether wearing gloves with short sleeves is acceptable...\n\nOne of football's more recent fashion trends has been players cutting holes in the back of their socks.\n\nPlayers are doing it to relieve pressure on their calf muscles when running in tight socks.\n\nOne of the rarer football fashion choices is that of tracksuit bottoms, which goalkeepers are allowed to wear.\n\nThey are among the game's more retro fashion choices, though former Crystal Palace No 1 Gabor Kiraly famously wore them throughout his career.\n\n\"I'm a goalie, not a model,\" he once said. \"I've played on clay or grass that's been frozen in winter; it makes your legs hurt when you fall so jogging bottoms seemed obvious.\"\n\nFormer Manchester United goalkeeper Massimo Taibi wore tracksuit bottoms during his short stint at Old Trafford, while former Colombia keeper Rene Higuita was wearing them while making his famous scorpion-kick save against England in 1995.\n\nCaps are a more traditional piece of attire for goalkeepers, who tend to wear them to aid visibility when there is a chance the sun will get in their eyes.\n\nIn recent seasons, Crystal Palace's Dean Henderson and Tottenham's Guglielmo Vicario have both sported club-branded caps during matches.\n\nHeadbands and Alice bands are becoming increasingly popular sights in men's football.\n\nEngland internationals Anthony Gordon and Noni Madueke are regular headband-wearers, while Tottenham midfielder Yves Bissouma wore one during Sunday's north London derby against Arsenal.\n\nThey are largely worn by players with longer hair to stop it falling over their eyes.\n\nFootballers are not allowed to wear branded headbands, though, and in 2022 former Newcastle winger Allan Saint-Maximin was fined by the Football Association for wearing one with a designer branding.\n\nPlayers have been banned from wearing snoods during matches since 2011, but prior to that Carlos Tevez, Samir Nasri and Ashley Young were among those who donned them during fixtures.\n\nPlayers and coaches still wear them frequently during pre-match warm-ups and training for an added layer of warmth.\n\nAnother accessory more commonly worn during colder months, skin-tight undershirts give players an added layer of warmth.\n\nPlayers did used to be able to wear a different coloured undershirt to their kit, but that was outlawed to prevent clashes.\n\nWith a number of shirt manufacturers opting not to make long-sleeved shirts that can be worn in Premier League matches, players often wear either short-sleeved shirts over undershirts or replica long-sleeved shirts that are made for commercial sales to supporters.\n\nPlayers commonly wear wrist tape in matches in order to stabilise their joints and limit the risk of sprains or injuries sustained in collisions or tackles.\n\nAt times, players also wear tape around their fingers for similar reasons.\n\nThe International Football Association Board - the body responsible for making the laws of the game - no longer allows players to wear tape over jewellery, which is not permitted to be worn.\n\nShinpads are very much a necessity - and an Ifab requirement for players - but the size of some has become a talking point.\n\nBurnley winger Marcus Edwards was among those pictured sporting particularly small shinpads during their Premier League defeat by West Ham.\n\nJack Grealish has also previously worn smaller shinpads - designed for increased mobility, comfort and ankle flexibility.\n\nAnother recent trend is for players to wear football socks that do not have 'feet' on them - usually known is footless socks.\n\nPlayers commonly cut the bottom of socks off themselves or buy them pre-made.\n\nInstead, players wear separate ankle socks for comfort and more flexibility in football boots compared to wearing a traditional one-piece sock.\n\nSimilarly to socks, some players have been cutting holes at the back of their football boots to make them more comfortable.\n\nSome footballers have Haglund's deformity - a condition in which people get an enlarged bony bump on the back of their heels which can rub against the inside of football boots.\n\nOther players cut their boots to put less pressure on their feet, with former Brazil internationals Neymar and Philippe Coutinho among those to do this.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nWho is one card away from suspension in the Premier League?\n\nVAR vs TMO – what are the key differences?\n\nWhich club has the most red cards in a Premier League season?\n\n'Who's going to get this fine?' - Arteta on derby technology delays",

I've found it to be much more useful than a travel backpack because I can wear it throughout my whole trip, rather than just at the airport. The best travel purses I tested have better storage options for a passport, phone, keys, and wallet, offering convenient access in a cute, wearable little package.\n\nFor more on the best personal items we love to travel with, see our guide to the best weekender bags and best carry-on luggage.\n\nTo find the stylish travel purses for staying organized, I tested 10 bags and wore each for at least 5 hours. I wore them in crowded urban areas, on road trips, and through hiking trails. I took note of how heavy they felt and how long it took me to grab things when I needed them, particularly at cash registers and while going through customs. Our team of editors have tested dozens of other crossbody bags on international flights and backcountry road trips, the best of which we added below.\n\nThe genius zippered vertical side pocket keeps everything organized. I wore this medium-sized crossbody bag for errand-filled city excursions, beach days, and a weekend cabin getaway. No other purse I tested felt so well-suited to such a range of environments.\n\nThe interior pockets are helpfully mesh-lined so I could see where everything was the moment I opened the bag. It's hard for me to choose a favorite pocket — there are so many smart ones, including the built-in card holder. \"My favorite part is its vertical zippered side pocket, where I can pull out my phone without taking the bag off my shoulder,\" writes senior associate style editor Gabrielle Chase.\n\nIt's lightweight, buttery soft, and comfy to carry all day. In addition to looking high-end, the leather feels silky-smooth and gentle on my skin. Even when I had the bag stuffed to maximum capacity, the wide adjustable strap lands really comfortably and evenly, never digging into my shoulder or back. It only weighs 10.8 ounces, which is impressive given the amount of storage options.\n\nIt can convert into three different bags. The adjustable, removable strap clicks into the body of the bag, allowing you to wear the Aoyama as a shoulder bag or even a clutch. Having one beautiful, adaptable bag that keeps me organized from the airport to a fancy dinner saves space in my suitcase. This kind of versatility makes the $248 price tag a bit more justifiable. There's also a nylon version that costs $178.\n\nRead \n\nIt's low-maintenance and machine-washable. Made of a durable-feeling recycled nylon, the fabric isn't what you might call \"luxury\"—rather, it's sporty and lightweight, which is far more important to me when I'm lugging suitcases and spilling coffee. Best of all for a messy, outdoorsy traveler like myself is that this Baggu is machine-washable.\n\nThe storage is simple and roomy. The Cargo Crossbody doesn't have as many specialized compartments as the other options I tested. Instead, there's just two exterior pockets and one interior zippered pocket. But the fact that the roomy interior is open gives me the option for all the other stuff I inevitably acquire while traveling. It can comfortably fit a wallet, sandwich, can of Diet Coke, a Nintendo switch, phone and a book, as I learned from my picnic in the park.\n\nIt comes in a variety of cute colors. Mine is a French blue, which adds a fun pop of color to any outfit (just because a bag is utilitarian and practical doesn't mean it has to be plain).\n\nI no longer have to root around in my bag for my phone. Before Bandolier, I'd yet to find an accessory that offers easy, fumble-free, repeated access to my phone, which I use constantly while traveling — checking reservations, looking at Google Maps, or filming my pasta like I'm an influencer.\n\nBandolier's sturdy leather phone case, which has a handy envelope for cards, upgraded my entire life. I can wearing my phone elegantly as a purse, with the crossbody strap clasped directly to the leather phone case. This made it so easy to grab and then \"put away,\" i.e. drop so it simply drapes across my body. The case clasps easily into Bandolier's expanded pouch, which can fit tickets, a thin wallet, a passport, keys, and a lip balm.\n\nThe materials and design feel expensive. Also, it is expensive. Both made of 100% leather, the Expanded Pouch is $98, and the Lily Duet (which is crossbody and wristlet phone case duo) costs $148. The sturdy pouch is a nice addition for a bit of extra storage, but you don't necessarily need to buy both: the phone case and detachable strap are enough.\n\nThe phone case itself is amazing. The back pocket card holder has a snap closure that keeps my credit card and ID secure and hidden. It's much safer than the exposed card holders I had before. I've made this my permanent phone case, whether traveling or not.\n\nThere are so many security features. The locking clasp straps are secure — they even take me a moment to undo when I'm just alone in my house, so I can't imagine how a thief would pull it off. I wore this bag through Times Square to get to a gynecologist appointment, and not for a second did I fear for the precious contents inside it (which included my anti-anxiety meds). Arden Cove makes it with \"slash-resistant lining\" and a hidden back zip pocket where I put my passport.\n\nIt can be worn in four ways. This Bum Bag's adjustable straps let me wear it as a belt bag, fanny pack, chest bag, or crossbody, which is ideal for crowded, high-traffic areas when I want my belongings as close to me as possible. The structure of the bag itself is less flexible than other options, but it allows you to keep everything close to the chest.\n\nThe storage is elite. I'm obsessed with its storage options, which includes two card holders that are perfect for subway cards, business cards, credit cards, IDs, and small tickets.\n\nIt's really comfortable. Away's simple design offers just the right amount of structure and slouch. It's made from a water-repellant polyester till feels cushiony and almost quilted. Even when I filled the bag with snacks, a big book, a Fuji camera, and my notebook, the padding around the strap prevented the bag from digging into my shoulders.\n\nIt has an impressive capacity. The Featherlight Crossbody weighs just over half a pound, yet has a storage capacity of 10 liters. I wore the bag on a bike trail along the Hudson River, to a Phillies game, and to Brighton Beach, where water and sand slid right off. It's also machine washable.\n\nThere are super useful hidden exterior pockets. I used the tiny one on the strap, which is perfect for AirPods or keys, and the other that's ideally sized for a passport and phone. These helped me avoid rummaging around in my bag in front of hotel receptionists and baristas.\n\nThere are so many ways to store things. I especially loved the convenience of the exterior magnetic-closure phone pocket. It has special compartments like card slots and pen loops, with loads of interior and exterior pockets for easy access to everyday items. I found myself constantly using the little loops for pens — a Godsend as mine are always scribbling on the bottom of my bags.\n\nIt looks cool. The Micah crossbody has a really distinctive, athletic look, with fun, chunky zippers. I felt really cool wearing it to yoga class and to the dog park. The 100% vegan material is made from 7 recycled plastic bottles, and it feels durable and sturdy.\n\nIt's lightweight and comfortable. It's can easily fit all the items I want while traveling — like documents, tablets, pens, books, and large headphones — but not something as large as a water bottle (for that, we suggest Dagne Dover's Sloan Sling instead).\n\nIt has a slim profile with a deceptively spacious main compartment. \"I toted it for a long day in New York City, and I appreciated that all my items were secured, but I knew exactly where to find them when I needed to,\" writes style contributor Talia Ergas.\n\nThere are eight pockets total, \"with organizational features galore designed with neat freaks like me in mind,\" says Talia. \"On the exterior, it has a front U-shaped pocket that offers a perfect compartment for stowing my cash and credit cards (in the leather card pocket), keys (via an easy access key leash), a pen (which stays secure thanks to a leather pen loop), and other quick-access items like a passport or tickets.\"\n\nIts lightweight design packs flat. Say you're wearing a backpack on the plane, but still want your Tumi Tyler Crossbody once you reach your destination. You can simply empty out the contents and the water resistant nylon exterior won't crumple, even if you have to smoosh it beneath the rest of your belongings.\n\nIt makes a trendy handbag into a practical purse. East-West bags — the long, skinny silhouette popularized by Alaia's $2,950 Le Teckel — can be horribly impractical. The slim body might be the trendiest shape right now, but I can't imagine squeezing travel essentials like sunscreen or snacks into a purse built like a pencil case. But the Gabrielle Shoulder Bag from Parisa Wang makes this purse trend practical. Not only is it supremely roomy, but it also has lots of functional features like quick-access pockets and handles that feel comfortable enough on your shoulder for all-day wear.\n\nThe elongated shape makes the purse incredibly spacious. I fit a hard-shell sunglass case, a 3.4-ounce bottle of sunscreen, a granola bar, a wallet, a pack of Band-Aids, two lipsticks, a claw clip, and all my little essentials like keys and AirPods in the purse with lots of room to spare. It also has two exterior pockets on either side of the bag, which are perfect for storing quick-access items like tickets or travel documents.\n\nIt works from day trips to dinner reservations. Lots of practical purses tend to lean too heavily into function at the cost of form. But this bag, with its smooth leather and minimalist look, would be chic enough for a stop at a Parisian wine bar after your walking tour. We all know the look of a tourist with their many-pocketed fanny pack, but this purse won't make you look like you came straight from a survivalist retreat. — Samantha Crozier, style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nMaria Yagoda, travel writer and style contributor: Maria is based in Brooklyn, where she covers travel and culture. It's where these two fields intersect that she's witnessed the latest style trends from across the globe. Whether she's flying to Italy or venturing upstate, Maria is intuiting which travel accessories are a worthy investment for most people in terms of convenience, comfort, and aesthetics.\n\nLearn how the Reviews team tests clothing, shoes, and accessories at Business Insider.\n\nStorage capacity: You want a travel purse that's small enough to not add bulk, but still has room inside for an umbrella, book, or souvenirs you pick up along the way. I found the ideal liter capacity for travel purses to be around 10 liters.\n\nSecurity features: Look for RFID-blocking compartments to protect your credit cards, and zippered closures. Crossbody bags offer a more secure fit that's harder to swipe off your person.\n\nWeight and adaptability: The more lightweight a travel purse is — and the more ways you can adjust its wide strap to distribute the weight — the more comfortable you'll be throughout your trip. Look for travel purses that weigh between 8 to 10 ounces.\n\nDurability: Look for machine washable, water-resistant materials (like nylon) especially if you'll be doing outdoorsy stuff.\n\nCompartments: Look for travel purses with horizontal and vertical zippered pockets on its interior, exterior, or even carrying strap.\n\nKAAI Rebel Crossbody ($575) This sporty, luxury-grade sling bag has a cool asymmetrical shape and is lined with a beautiful blue suede. Unfortunately it was too narrow and structured to fit anything bulky.\n\nQuince Italian Leather Convertible Crescent Shoulder Bag ($119) This is a well-made Italian leather purse that looks a lot like the very trendy Clare V. Moyen Messenger ($435). It's comfortable to wear, but the internal organization is somewhat minimal.\n\nCuyana Mini Paloma Bag ($398) It's elegant, compact, and has good organizational features, but was just a bit too small for my everyday carry. This one's better suited to minimalist travelers.\n\nCaraa Nimbus ($190) Design-wise, this bag has a very distinctive, cool look. It's kind of fluffy and cloud-like, so it could be used as a travel pillow if you're desperate. The storage space is really flexible and can accommodate quite a lot, but it only has three interior pockets.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

    "description": "Effective boards increasingly depend on diversity of background, expertise, and style to avoid groupthink and enhance innovation. Yet many fail to convert that diversity into inclusive dynamics where all directors feel heard and influential. Interviews with 30 directors from boards representing $18 trillion in market value reveal that inclusion is an active practice, not a byproduct of representation. It requires leaders who deliberately manage conflict as a source of insight, broaden director recruitment beyond traditional profiles, set the tone through facilitation and coaching, design onboarding and mentoring for new members, and dismantle “boards-within-the-board” that create damaging insider-outsider hierarchies.",

    "description": "Jeans are built to last, but fashion trends aren't. For millennials, shifting denim styles have become an unexpected reminder of aging and identity.",
    "fullText": "Millennials, welcome to your mom jeans era. I don't mean that you're obligated to wear the jeans you made fun of your own mother for wearing 20 years ago. Those are actually cool now! The uncool fit is those skinny jeans you practically slept in during the 2010s. Oh, and Gen Z, before you laugh, that combo of loose-leg light-denim jeans and white sneakers you love will date you soon enough. And to the teens sporting the modern-day version of JNCO jeans, your Gen X aunts don't know whether to feel proud of you or laugh at you behind your back.\n\nJeans are a staple of most people's wardrobes. The garment is a durable, democratic basic — a versatile piece that, depending on how you style it, can be worn to the grocery store, a night on the town, and even work. Jeans are also among the most fraught and volatile attire we own. For an item thought of as timeless, jeans are anything but. Waistlines rise and fall, legs widen and narrow, and what felt modern just a few seasons ago can suddenly seem embarrassingly outdated. And because jeans are worn so often and sit so closely to the body, these shifts can feel quite personal.\n\nJeans are a Rorschach test for identity, belonging, and aging. As trends evolve at internet-accelerated speeds, it can feel impossible to keep up. For women, the pressure is especially acute.\n\nYour pants may be designed to last, structurally, but they're not meant to endure, culturally.\n\n\"The fashion industry builds in this social obsolescence,\" says Carolyn Mair, a behavioral psychologist who specializes in the fashion business. \"However well we try to phrase it, looking old is something that most people do not aspire to.\"\n\nShara Seigel is at a crossroads with jeans. She wore skinny jeans throughout most of her young adult years, and she built up an even bigger collection when she lost a significant amount of weight four years ago. She felt proud to show off her new figure, until some of her friends — including fellow millennials — started making fun of her look. Seigel, who's 40 and works in New York City at a public relations firm, has tried to expand her pants collection, but she feels like the new, baggier styles aren't flattering.\n\n\"Everyone looks like they're wearing a potato sack,\" she says.\n\nSeigel has bought some updated styles that she feels are a \"happy medium,\" including flared legs and looser fits, but she's not spending much money on them. \"You get to an age, probably as a millennial, where you're like I don't need to keep up with the fashion to be cool,\" she says. Plus, what if skinny comes back?\n\nFor millennials, skinny jeans were more than a trend — they were a uniform. Waistlines and washes may have changed throughout the 2000s and 2010s, but the tight, tapered fit did not. \"It was really hard to not see a skinny jean,\" says Sonya Abrego, a design historian based in New York. \"But then the pendulum swung so hard in the other direction.\"\n\nWide-leg, baggier styles started to become the de facto silhouette for influencers and fashion-forward people around 2017, says Susie Draffan, a senior denim strategist at trend forecasting firm WGSN, but it took the average consumer a while to catch up. There's always a lag between the runway and the mass market, which was extended by pandemic lockdowns. We missed fashion cues we might otherwise pick up by osmosis from just seeing each other, and the pandemic exacerbated the trend toward comfort. The people working from home were doing so in sweatpants and leggings, not Levi's.\n\nPost-pandemic, we've seen a \"democratization\" of denim, Draffan says. \"Multiple styles are trending simultaneously, as consumers swap between jean silhouettes to suit their outfits and moods,\" she says.\n\nUnfortunately for millennials, even as multiple styles have shared a synchronous moment, skinny jeans are not on the current \"it\" list. Sales of skinny jeans declined in 2021 for the first time in a decade. Like ankle socks and the side part, they've turned into a signifier of a cohort that is no longer ascendant.\n\n\"Skinny jeans make you look old,\" Abrego tells me.\n\nThe upside: Draffan says skinny jeans are \"due for a revival,\" thanks to 2010s nostalgia and GLP-1s. Thin is in again, and denim is transforming accordingly.\n\nThe capitalist churn around denim runs deeper than the revolution between skinny and wide-leg and back again. Jeans occupy an unusually loaded spot in our wardrobes. They're not just a top we only expect to keep for a season or a pair of pants we toss on to go about our days — they tie into youth, identity, and social belonging.\n\nWhen we talk about jeans, we're not just talking about the garment. Jeans are a vehicle for commenting on, thinking about, and forming social expectations around the body that's inside the jeans, Emma McClendon, a fashion historian, says. A shift in styles can change how a body is read — and, by extension, how its wearer is perceived.\n\n\"Since the later 20th century, there's really been a very strong connection between jeans and the body and also jeans and sex and sexuality,\" says Emma McClendon, a fashion historian. From about the 1970s on, brands such as Jordache and Calvin Klein have shifted much of their marketing and product development toward fashion-forward silhouettes, harnessing the power of sex to sell jeans to women. Just look at the infamous Brooke Shields Calvin Klein ad from 1980, or Sydney Sweeney's provocative American Eagle ad last year.\n\nOr look at the body politics around mom jeans — the relaxed-fit, high-waisted, lightly tapered cut that middle-aged women were skewered for in the late 1990s and 2000s. Saturday Night Live went as far as to parody them in a 2003 sketch, poking fun at how unfashionable they were.\n\n\"It became a cultural joke or a cultural punchline that women of a certain age were not comfortable wearing the prevalent style of jeans,\" McClendon says.\n\nWhen we're no longer seen as trendy, we may feel our social value drop. As much as our jeans are supposed to be long-lasting and timeless, when they become outdated, it destabilizes our self-perception. In turn, that nudges us to buy a new pair to keep up.\n\n\"We want to buy durable products, but at the same time, we have these products with built-in social obsolescence that we then have to replace with something,\" Mair, the behavioral psychologist, says. \"Otherwise, our identity is challenged. We see ourselves as part of the day, part of the modern, progressive way of looking.\"\n\nDenim-related anxiety isn't shared equally among genders. While men's styles do evolve, they do so more slowly. Many men can buy the same cut year after year without anyone saying a peep. Women's jeans cycle through much faster, and societally, women have more pressure to look the part. They're judged more harshly on appearance and face greater stigma as they age. Women can hop off the pants roller coaster, but men have an easier time doing it. A man wearing the same Levi's 501s from college to his 50th birthday is timeless; a woman doing the same would get some eye rolls.\n\nDenim itself is very trendy at the moment. There was concern about a decade ago that athleisure might pose a real threat to the fabric's extraordinary staying power, but we're now firmly in a denim renaissance — a denim-ssance, if you will. The exploding number of shapes, silhouettes, and styles can be overwhelming. Designers and brands are experimenting with different waistbands, cuts, washes, and lengths. Moreover, trends cycle through faster than ever, thanks to the internet. Consumers don't just notice in fashion magazines or on TV that their style might be lagging, they have a TikTok influencer in their face telling them the thing they love is \"cheugy,\" though that pejorative is probably outdated now, too.\n\nThis works to the fashion industry's advantage: Pushing you to grab those cross-waistband jeans you keep seeing advertised on Instagram or pick up cargo pants again against your better judgment is great for their bottom line.\n\nIt is, of course, possible to resist trend-chasing. Aja Barber, a consultant and writer who focuses on sustainability and fashion, says there comes a point when many people decide to opt out of the \"circus.\" \"You can try and shame people, but any person that has a real sense of self just does not care,\" she says. And if you do want to update, there are plenty of ways to shop secondhand. Denim production is a highly water-intensive and polluting process, so it's environmentally friendly to take advantage of the fact that a lot of what's new again is actually old. \"There's nothing new under the sun when it comes to jeans,\" she says.\n\nOne of the nice things about the current boom is that it's an opportunity to try out a variety of styles to figure out what works best for you. Instead of lamenting the loss of your skinny jeans, rejoice in the freedom of variation!\n\nThat's what Stephanie Borman, a 39-year-old tech worker in San Francisco, has been doing. Her body changed after having her two children, prompting her to do some reflecting on her fashion choices. \"I thought, gosh, why am I continuing to squeeze myself into a style that doesn't serve me or my body type anymore and just might not be culturally relevant?\" she says. Coming of age — accompanied by the budget afforded by a stable career — has allowed her to explore and invest in styles that suit her. It doesn't mean she's entirely free of millennial-induced insecurities — her kids recently made fun of her jeans for looking like something their dad would wear, and when she's tried to wear her hair in the Gen Z-approved middle part, she thinks it makes her look Amish.\n\nA lot of people have a lot of feelings about jeans. Reporting for this story, I heard from a variety of women about their gripes. Why are all the jeans right now a smidge too short? What's going on with frayed bottoms? Is it true that ultra-low-rise is coming back? A friend mentioned a man she dated a couple of years back told her he didn't like it when women wore updated looser jeans styles — he was into fitted and skinny jeans only. It didn't work out.\n\nMany consumers have some memory of fitting-room jeans trauma. I remember standing in a Madewell dressing room a couple of years ago, overhearing a sales associate explaining to a customer — likely a millennial — that she just needed to get used to seeing her legs in wider jeans. I needed the advice, too. Whether certain styles work for certain wearers isn't just about age or style, it's about body type, and it can feel incredibly frustrating when the trendiest silhouettes just don't work for your shape. Tori Mattei, 29, a communications professional in New York City, tells me she's all but given up on jeans at this point. \"As a 4'11\" woman who's definitely not stick thin, they are not made for me,\" she says. \"What's stylish doesn't always look good on your body.\"\n\nI sometimes joke that this should be the final stage of jeans — even though skinny is out (to my millennial chagrin), so many other styles are in, and the looser ones really are comfy. It would be incredible if the diversity of denim looks just stuck. But past is prologue, meaning trends will inevitably evolve, and everyone will at some point look dated. It's a hallmark of getting older. It's important to remember, as McClendon notes, \"It doesn't make you cultural garbage.\"\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "fullText": "New York Giants legend Eli Manning delivered a candid and optimistic assessment of quarterback Jaxson Dart's future during a recent appearance on ESPN New York with Dave Rothenberg and Rick DiPietro.\n\nAs the franchise transitions into a new era under head coach John Harbaugh, Manning expressed strong confidence in the direction of the team, particularly with Dart positioned as the long-term signal-caller.\n\nWhen asked about the excitement surrounding the Giants' fresh start, Manning responded affirmatively.\n\n\"No, I mean, I think you should be excited. I think the John Harbaugh hire,\" Manning said, \"you could not have asked for a better situation getting him... He’s the coach we needed, but usually, you know the coach that’s unavailable, and so I think there’s a lot of excitement there. You (have) Jaxson Dart... you have your quarterback of the future.\"\n\nManning went on to praise Dart's intangibles, highlighting his leadership qualities.\n\n\"Well, I just think he’s a great leader. I’ve seen that in the locker room, just how people talk about him. And obviously he has earned his teammates' respect through his preparation, through his play, and, you know, I think through his toughness,\" he said.\n\nThe two-time Super Bowl champion also offered pointed advice on the next phase of Dart's development, addressing the challenge many young, mobile quarterbacks face in balancing their athleticism with smarter decision-making.\n\n\"That’s kind of like the, you know, the next step for young quarterbacks is, hey, I have the ability to run, but I don’t want to do that too often. You know, I want to get the ball to the receivers,\" Manning said, \"it’s just kind of finding that sweet spot of, you know, when you know, hey, I need to get the ball out.\"\n\nManning's comments underscore a blend of endorsement and realism: Dart possesses the tools and presence to succeed, but refining his timing, progressions, and willingness to avoid unnecessary risks will be crucial to unlocking his full potential as the Giants' franchise quarterback.\n\nFans, long weary of quarterback instability, have reason for guarded optimism in this pairing of elite coaching and emerging talent.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Eli Manning offers blunt take on New York Giants QB Jaxson Dart",

    "description": "Quang Hoang did Y Combinator twice: In 2016 for Birdly and in 2025 for Vybe. He said that his first experience was more \"family-style.\"",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Quang Hoang, the 37-year-old cofounder and CEO of Vybe, who lives in San Francisco. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWe started 10 years ago. We were out of college and wanted to solve a problem that we experienced ourselves. When you're a student, you don't have that many problems.\n\nWhen we were interns, we had a lot of expense reports, but we would lose receipts and lose money. When you're a student, you don't have much money. One of the first problems we wanted to solve was: Let's build a mobile app to save your receipts, a bit like Expensify.\n\nSlack released its first API at the time. Now, we could create a bot. That was our pitch to YC: This is a new thing called a Slack bot. During the interview, they installed the Slack bot, and it pinged everyone in the YC Slack. Everyone started to use it. We got in.\n\nIt was 2016. At the time, it was in Mountain View. Sam Altman was still a partner. We had some office hours with him.\n\nThe core principle remained the same, but everything felt way less streamlined and processed than it is today. For example, the dinners were way more family-style. There weren't any visible employees. Some of the partners were cooking sometimes. Paul Graham was there.\n\nWe still were 100 people total in the batch, which is probably 3x less than it is today. Everything was in-person. We came from France and rented a house. It was a big difference to be in Mountain View when you've never lived in the US, than when you already live in San Francisco, and you do YC for the second time.\n\nThe former company was bought two years ago by Coda, which was acquired by Grammarly. Then, I discovered vibe coding. I decided that Notion, Airtable, Coda, and Retool are going to be the incumbents, and that a new category of vibe-coding platforms are going to emerge.\n\nOne of the partners at YC is also a friend, Nicolas Dessaigne. He said, \"You should apply to YC.\" It was a big opportunity cost to leave the company that acquired me, and having something like YC is a bit reassuring.\n\nThe fundamentals are still the same. You still have to talk to users, code, and grow. You still have to grow every single week at a steady percentage growth. It was 5-10% at the time; today it's more like 10, 12, 15%.\n\nYou have more and more young founders. It's not something that happened in the past 10 years; it probably happened in the past two years. I was one of the old folks. It was also my second company. Many are first-time founders.\n\nI think it was already the case that you want young founders that don't know limits and don't have anything that would prevent them from thinking really big. With AI, it's the same thing.\n\nA constant debate that you have less when you're a first-time founder is: Should I ship this, or should I double-check it? As a younger, first-time founder, you might have less experience with technical depth because you might not have worked with bigger companies before. You say: Let's ship this.\n\nThe batch sizes don't feel that different. The interaction you have with your batch is through weekly dinners, group office hours, individual office hours, and Demo Day. You also have some workshops here and there. If you are 300 or 400 people in the batch, it doesn't change that much if you're in subgroups.\n\nSometimes there are events, like when Sam Altman comes to talk, or the CEO of Perplexity or Cursor, where you need to have the whole batch. But, it's conference style anyway. You have 400 people in a room, sure, but if it's 150 or 400, it's the same.\n\nThe themes changed a lot, obviously. It was a lot of mobile apps and cloud. Today, it's a lot of AI. The brand of YC helps a lot. The brand is probably 10x better today than it was 10 years ago.\n\nDemo Day was way more important at the time than it is today. It feels more like an anchor date. It gives urgency to investors: if you don't invest in the hot startups now, they will meet with thousands of investors two weeks from now, and you might just lose your opportunity.\n\nGood investors all invest before Demo Day. It's just an anchor date to create a timeline for the investor and the startup.\n\nIf you ask me: Are you happy that you went back to YC? The answer is super straightforward. It's 100% yes.",

They blew a 15-point lead in the second half, but Doncic scored 12 points in the fourth quarter as the Lakers split the four-game season series with their crosstown rivals.\n\nKawhi Leonard scored 31 points before missing the final 5:10 with an apparent ankle injury for the Clippers (27-29), who fell just short of getting back to .500 in incredible fashion after their 6-21 start to the season.\n\nBennedict Mathurin had 26 points and seven rebounds in his second straight outstanding game for his new team before fouling out with 1:49 to play. The athletic guard acquired from Indiana for center Ivica Zubac dropped a career-high-tying 38 against Denver on Thursday.\n\nDerrick Jones Jr. scored on consecutive possessions to trim the Lakers' lead to 123-120 with 46 seconds left. Nicolas Batum then stole James' pass in the final seconds, but the Frenchman missed a tying 3-point attempt with 4 seconds left.\n\nDoncic, James and Reaves were able to play together for only the 11th time in the Lakers’ 55 games this season, thanks to a rare moment of full health for the Lakers coming out of the break. They responded with a prolific offensive performance, even while James managed just two points in the second half.\n\nIn Doncic’s return from a four-game absence followed by a five-minute All-Star Game appearance due to a mildly strained hamstring, the Slovenian superstar scored 17 points with four 3-pointers in a dynamic first quarter for the Lakers, who made 16 of 17 shots in one stretch.\n\nLeonard, who had just one bucket in the first, answered with a 19-point second.\n\nThe Clippers' John Collins was helped off the court with 18 seconds left in the first half after he bloodied his face on a hard landing while trying to catch a long pass at the rim.\n\nClippers: Host Orlando on Sunday.",

    "title": "I'm an American who's lived in Paris for nearly a decade. These 8 things have surprised me about living in the French capital.",
    "description": "As an American, living in Paris for almost a decade has come with many surprises about French culture, fashion, healthcare, and smoking habits.",
    "fullText": "Shortly after I turned 25, I asked myself: \"If you could live anywhere, where would it be?\" The answer was always Paris.\n\nGrowing up in the US, I'd taken French classes from sixth grade through college. The language and the culture were always on my radar, so I decided to take the leap.\n\nEt voilà! About nine years later, I still live in Paris full-time. Here are a few things that have surprised me about life in the French capital over the years.\n\nIn Paris, I rarely cross paths with people wearing sweatpants or leggings in public, which is a stark contrast to my experience in the US.\n\nMost people in the French capital seem to put effort into their appearances and dress one step above what I'd consider casual in the US, even if they're making a quick run to the grocery store.\n\nI see a lot of tailored trousers paired with plain sweaters and scarves. People also dress up jeans with loafers or crisp white sneakers and tailored jackets.\n\nIn the US, I had three fashion modes: going-out clothes (crop tops, jeans, and heels), athleisure (leggings, colored sneakers, and tank tops), and office attire (slacks, loafers, and silky blouses).\n\nOn Saturdays, I was dressed for either the bars or the gym. There was really no in-between.\n\nLiving here has improved my sense of style and helped me take pride in how I present myself. My new, simplified wardrobe consists of smart, simple pieces I can wear during the day and in the evening.\n\nI've developed a uniform of sorts, mixing trousers, jeans, white sneakers, silk maxi skirts, plain T-shirts, tailored jackets, and lots of black pieces.\n\nGetting dressed is easier with a capsule wardrobe — I feel ready for anything when I leave the house.\n\nWhen I was living stateside, it seemed I was always asked where I worked out, not whether I worked out. And I'd regularly go to the gym first thing in the morning.\n\nThough new gyms and studios have cropped up in Paris in recent years, the fitness scene doesn't feel nearly as prominent here as it does in the US.\n\nI joined a gym when I arrived purely out of habit, but I've since changed my routine. Lately, I go on a leisurely jog along the Seine a few times a week instead.\n\nMany Parisians I know walk a ton and lead active lifestyles, even if they aren't in the weight room at 6 a.m. Although I'm exercising less here in Paris, I've never felt healthier.\n\nThe first time I went to lunch with my colleagues in Paris, we stayed at the restaurant from noon until 2 p.m. Everyone ordered a three-course meal that included appetizers, entrées, desserts, and coffee.\n\nIn the US, I got used to grabbing a quick salad and inhaling it at my desk while working, so I had to adjust to this slower pace.\n\nI quickly learned that long lunches filled with conversation are very common in Paris.\n\nAs much as I appreciate this mindset, I'm not a big lunch person. So, I've started declining invites to avoid being stuck for hours at a time.\n\nBaguettes are a way of life here. Bread is a component of almost every meal and is meant to be eaten with the main courses, not beforehand as an appetizer as it is in the US.\n\nMost baguettes in France contain just flour, water, yeast, and salt. There are no preservatives, meaning they can go stale in a short amount of time. It's not uncommon for people in Paris to buy a fresh baguette every day.\n\nWith boulangeries selling them for less than 2 euros a pop, who can blame them?\n\nThe legal drinking age in France is 18, which could play into the mindset I've noticed surrounding alcohol here.\n\nDrinking is part of France's culture, and based on what I've seen, the focus isn't on getting drunk the way it can be in the US, where people can't legally purchase or consume alcohol until they're 21. Here, it's about socialization.\n\nOf course, I've seen my fair share of locals overdo it since moving to Paris (and people's drinking habits vary the same way they do around the world), but jungle-juice parties, drinking games, and vodka-soaked watermelons don't seem to be as popular among people in their 20s here.\n\nInebriation feels like a byproduct of drinking in Paris rather than its purpose.\n\nThe first time I picked up a prescription in Paris, the pharmacist took a pen and wrote instructions on the box herself. I thought I was on an episode of \"Punk'd.\"\n\nMy name and information weren't included on the box, and the only way I knew how much to take was by reading her handwritten cursive, which was in French and somewhat hard to read.\n\nIn the US, pill boxes tend to have all the relevant information — such as the patient's name, birth date, and dosage instructions — printed in giant letters.\n\nBefore I moved to Paris, I was aware of the stereotype that French people are big smokers. I half expected it to be false (as so many clichés are), so I was surprised to find that cigarettes are actually very common here.\n\nWalk down a busy street in Paris around noon, and you will pass dozens of Parisians smoking before lunch. Grab a seat at a café, and you will find an ashtray on the table. Have a drink with a friend on a terrace, and you may sit directly next to someone ready to pull out a cigarette.\n\nSmoking is prohibited in enclosed public places, workplaces, and public parks, so I didn't expect so many nightclubs to have designated-smoking rooms inside. I've also noticed that it's completely normal for people to light up at crowded concerts.\n\nI've seen plenty of locals smoke inside at house parties in Paris (usually by a window or in a bathroom, to be fair), which I rarely, if ever, saw happen in the US.\n\nThe smoking here put me off in the beginning — partly because I have asthma — but after several years in Paris, it doesn't bother me as much anymore.\n\nThe most surprising thing about moving to Paris was the realization that healthcare costs significantly less here than it does in the US, where steep copays and premiums are par for the course.\n\nOf course, I knew about France's healthcare system before I relocated, but it was something altogether different to experience it firsthand.\n\nThe US has a mixed healthcare system that doesn't provide universal coverage, so it was quite a change to see France's social security, a government-funded healthcare system, cover every person who permanently resides in the country.\n\nEveryone in France contributes to social security, so it isn't free, but the healthcare system reimburses most medical costs.\n\nSince moving to Paris, I've rarely paid out of pocket for doctor visits and medications. If I wanted to, I could also enroll in supplemental health insurance provided by private companies, which some people in France do.\n\nI got sick in the winter of 2017 and begrudgingly went to the emergency room in Paris because I was having trouble breathing. If I were in the US, I probably would've avoided going at all costs because of how expensive hospital bills can be.\n\nWhen I protested the physician's request for chest X-rays (a force of habit, as X-rays can cost thousands of dollars in the US), she responded by telling me that it would be covered by social security.\n\nThat was the moment I understood what universal health coverage really meant.\n\nSince I've moved to France, I always do the tests and see the specialists as soon as I have a health concern. Here, looking after my health is not a luxury I have to budget for.\n\nThis story was originally published on June 27, 2023, and most recently updated on February 20, 2026.",

    "title": "Photos show how 'Love Story' recreated Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy's iconic style",
    "description": "The new series, starring Paul Anthony Kelly and Sarah Pidgeon, recreates several of Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy's real outfits.",
    "fullText": "The iconic style of Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy has been often imitated but never replicated — until now.\n\n\"Love Story,\" which is produced by Ryan Murphy for FX, chronicles the fated relationship between John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, who died in a plane crash off the coast of Martha's Vineyard in July 1999.\n\nThe series has drawn praise for its striking casting — with Sarah Pidgeon bearing an uncanny resemblance to Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy and Paul Anthony Kelly closely capturing the look of John F. Kennedy Jr. — as well as for its thoughtful costume design, which carefully recreates and honors Bessette-Kennedy's real-life style.\n\nHere's a look at how the show recreated and paid homage to Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy's style.\n\nIn this scene, before she meets John F. Kennedy Jr. for the first time, Carolyn (played by Sarah Pidgeon) wears a simple black turtleneck, flared black capri pants, and black leather loafers.\n\nIn both the show and real life, Bessette-Kennedy worked as a showroom assistant for Calvin Klein before rising the ranks to become head of publicity for the fashion house.\n\nShe was often seen wearing loose Levi's 517 jeans, her hair slicked back into a bun, with a simple monochromatic coat over the top.\n\nWhen it came to recreating the New York City icon's style, the series didn't always nail it. Early leaked images from the set were criticized online for being too modern, fast-fashion-looking, and different from Kennedy-Bessette's more upscale style.\n\nIn response to the backlash, the show brought in a new costume designer, Rudy Mance, who dedicated himself to making the costumes as accurate as possible.\n\n\"I get it. I'm protective of [John and Carolyn] as well. We all just wanted to be as precise and accurate as possible,\" Mance told Variety.\n\nMance said he and his team studied for months throughout filming, comparing old paparazzi photos of the couple with the new looks he was creating for the show and pulling in as many archival and vintage pieces as possible to accurately recreate the look.\n\n\"There's so much mystery about Carolyn. My familiarity with her was through paparazzi images,\" lead actor Sarah Pidgeon told Vogue.\n\nMance said that recreating Kennedy's style before she was thrust into the public eye was the most challenging.\n\n\"Everybody knows what they wore from 1996 to 1999, but we were telling the story of how they met,\" he said, according to Glamour.\n\nBessette-Kennedy often looked effortlessly sexy when she stepped out on red carpets, like in the strapless black Yohji Yamamoto gown photographed above. Pidgeon wears a similar dress for her meet-cute with Kelly in episode one of the series.\n\nIt was delicate work for Pidgeon to strike the same balance, especially when fans reacted strongly to early images of her in the role. However, the actor told Vogue she was ultimately grateful for the public feedback about her portrayal.\n\n\"The online conversations at the beginning of the process served as a reminder of how important it was to get our portrayal of Carolyn correct. She grew even more important to me,\" Pidgeon told Vogue. \"People really, really love Carolyn, and my priority every single day on set was doing justice to her legacy.\"\n\nAlthough Bessette-Kennedy's simple outfits could be recreated with off-brand designers — like the white blouse and floor-length black skirt by Yohji Yamamoto that she wore in 1999 — Mance was dedicated to finding archival pieces. Pidgeon was wearing true recreations of Bessette-Kennedy's looks whenever possible.\n\nHe also ensured the pieces would fit Pidgeon similarly to how they fit Bessette-Kennedy, as Pidgeon told Vogue.\n\n\"We found her Prada and Valentino coats, and fitted some Levi's so that they looked exactly how they fit Carolyn,\" Pidgeon told Vogue.\n\nKennedy's clothes were always going to play a central part in her on-screen portrayal since style was so critical to her identity. However, Pidgeon said she hoped the clothes she wears offer a jumping-off point for the total woman she hopes to portray.\n\n\"She is known as this minimalist fashion icon, but I learned that she was also vivacious, funny, and had a wildness about her,\" she told Vogue.",

    "description": "Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy's style epitomized quiet luxury and old-money aesthetics in the '90s.",
    "fullText": "Arguably, no one can nail classic, \"cool-girl\" style quite like Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy did.\n\nBessette-Kennedy shot to prominence in the mid to late '90s as the girlfriend and then the wife of John F. Kennedy Jr., the son of former President John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy Jr., Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, and her older sister, Lauren Bessette, were killed in a plane crash on July 16, 1999. There were no survivors from the accident, which happened off the coast of Martha's Vineyard.\n\nBefore her passing, Bessette-Kennedy was known as a fashion icon, thanks to her minimalist outfits, which embodied what we now call the quiet-luxury aesthetic and featured a color palette of mostly black, white, beige, and navy blue.\n\nHer personal style is now coming back into the zeitgeist with the release of Ryan Murphy's \"Love Story,\" which chronicles the couple's seven-year relationship.\n\nHere are 11 of Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy's best, most timeless looks.\n\nPictured here with John F. Kennedy Jr. in front of their Tribeca apartment in New York City, Bessette-Kennedy embodied classic autumnal fashion by pairing patent-leather brown boots with a simple black sweater and a camel-colored, calf-length skirt.\n\nShe accessorized with an understated black-leather bag and swept her blonde hair back into a low ponytail.\n\nBessette-Kennedy knew how to ace perfectly tailored, classic pieces similar to the ones Klein is known for, like this structured white button-up and black mermaid-tail skirt.\n\nVogue called this minimalist look \"the epitome of uptown glamour without compromising her pared-back aesthetic.\"\n\nPictured here with her husband at the Municipal Art Society Gala in 1998, Bessette-Kennedy wore a strapless black column gown, velvet gloves, and pointed strappy stiletto heels.\n\nIn 1996, while walking around New York City, she was photographed wearing a flowy summer dress with a bright floral print, black strappy heels, and a black, patent-leather handbag.\n\nThis classic look, from the black sleeveless tank to the brown-and-cream heeled sandals, would still be stylish now.\n\nThese rounded black sunglasses paired with a black button-up and green cargo pants epitomized '90s fashion.\n\nWhile heading to the airport to catch a flight for Bill Clinton's inauguration in January 1997, Bessette-Kennedy was photographed wearing a camel-colored skirt, black leather boots, and a belted black suede coat.\n\nShe finished the look with a tortoise-shell headband and a pair of oval sunglasses.\n\nWhen attending the Newman's Own George Awards in 1999, she paired a black coat with ruffled detailing with simple black pants and strappy heels.\n\nIn this 1996 ensemble, she layered a grey Miu Miu dress beneath a sleek black coat, striking a balance between understated elegance and effortless cool.\n\nTall black boots elongated the silhouette, while a glossy patent-leather bag added a more playful touch.\n\nBessette-Kennedy effortlessly blended elegance and simplicity in her fashion, becoming one of the decade's most recognizable style icons.\n\nThere's no arguing that Bessette-Kennedy, through her iconic minimalist style, made a lasting impact on the fashion world. She showed that while fast-fashion trends come and go, simple elegance lasts forever.",

    "fullText": "Luxury fashion may portray an image of glamor and exclusivity, but not all that glitters is gold.\n\nBehind the more than five-figure price tags and highly coveted brand names, the industry has struggled with declining sales and cautious consumer spending amid ongoing economic uncertainty.\n\nFounded in 1963, Kering is the French multinational luxury goods group behind some of the most recognizable high-end houses, including Gucci, Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta, Balenciaga, and Alexander McQueen.\n\nDespite being the world's second-largest luxury group, with revenue of €14.7 billion ($17.38 billion) in 2025, Kering has faced mounting pressure in recent years. Leadership changes, shifting consumer preferences, and broader industry headwinds have challenged its performance.\n\nNow, the company is preparing to embark on a major transformation that will reshape its entire business.\n\nKering (PPRUY) shuttered 133 stores across its brands in 2025, representing a net reduction of 75 units, and bringing its total store count to 1,719 as of December 31. The company said during an earnings call that the closures targeted underperforming locations that no longer aligned with its strategy to increase sales and elevate brand positioning.\n\nAn additional 100 store closures are already scheduled worldwide, with further reductions under review. Gucci is expected to account for the largest share of those cuts.\n\nAsia-Pacific: 42\n\nKering said this move aimed to reinforce its operational discipline while protecting its brand, delivering a higher-quality retail footprint.\n\nThe company also reduced its inventory by 8% in 2025 and plans to trim it further in 2026 to lower costs and better meet consumer demand.\n\nThe closures come amid Kering's declining financial performance.\n\nFor the full year of 2025, total revenues fell 13% year over year and 10% on a comparable basis. Gucci, the group's largest and most influential brand, suffered the biggest decrease, with revenue down 22% and 19% on a comparable basis, according to its latest earnings report.\n\n\"These results are not where we want to be, but they mark the bottom and the first steps of the turnaround we have initiated,\" said Kering Senior Analyst Luca Solca in the earnings call.\n\nTo reignite growth, Kering plans to reduce its dependence on fashion while expanding into other high-potential luxury categories.\n\n\"This discipline is precisely what provides a healthy financial foundation to fund our comeback,\" said Kering CFO Armelle Poulou in the earnings call. \"To support our brands, we continue to invest selectively in key areas while maintaining strict cost control in others.\"\n\nIn October 2025, Kering agreed to sell its beauty division to L'Oréal for $4.7 billion, granting it a 50-year exclusive licensing agreement, expected to take effect in the first half of 2026, according to a company press release.\n\nBoth companies are also forming a joint venture focused on luxury, wellness, and longevity, aiming to accelerate innovation in fragrance and cosmetics for its major luxury Houses, a space they view as high-growth and high-value in the long term.\n\n\"This partnership allows us to focus on what defines us best: the creative power and desirability of our Houses,\" said Kering CEO Luca de Meo in the press release.\n\nBeyond beauty, Kering sees jewelry as a resilient and underdeveloped opportunity within its portfolio. Though currently a small contributor to the group's revenue, the category has withstood the broader luxury downturn better than fashion.\n\nTo strengthen its capabilities, Kering acquired Raselli Farco at the end of last year and plans to continue investing in this sector. The company will share its full jewelry strategy in more detail at Capital Markets Day in April.\n\nKering's leadership team repeatedly emphasized creativity as the foundation of the turnaround.\n\n\"Creativity is our North Star,\" said Solca in the earnings call. \"It is what sets luxury apart. But creativity only becomes value when execution follows at the same pace: in retail, in supply chain, in merchandising, in marketing. This is where we are putting our energy into.\"\n\nSolca added that, on the ground, Kering's products are reconnecting with consumers. The company saw sales improvements in the second half of 2025, suggesting early signs of stabilization.\n\n\"The momentum is real: early, fragile, but real. And I can guarantee you that we will build on it,\" said Solca.\n\nKering is not the only company struggling; fashion has been navigating a persistent slump over the past few years.\n\nMcKinsey & Company's State of Fashion 2026 Report projects low-single-digit growth for the global fashion industry in 2026. Macroeconomic volatility and tariff pressures are expected to continue shaping value-conscious consumer behavior, particularly in the U.S., where consumer sentiment remained low throughout 2025.\n\n\"In the end, 2026 will likely be another year of dislocation for fashion companies,\" said McKinsey & Company Fashion Retail Analysts.\n\nGlobal retailer closes 132 stores across several brands\n\nBad Bunny’s bargain outfit breaks Super Bowl fashion tradition\n\n159-year-old retail giant announces more store closures\n\nMost recently, luxury retailer Saks Global also disclosed plans to close an additional nine stores following the shutdown of hundreds of locations and its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.\n\nLVMH (LVMUY), the world's largest luxury goods conglomerate, also faced headwinds, with revenues declining 5% for the full year of 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, e-commerce continues expanding its share of consumer spending.\n\nWith 84.3% of Americans shopping online, U.S. e-commerce spending reached $1.34 trillion in 2024 and is projected to surpass $2.5 trillion in 2030, according to Capital One Shopping.\n\nStill, physical stores remain the dominant preferred format for most consumers, accounting for around $14.4 trillion of total retail sales of $18.9 trillion in 2025, according to Euromonitor research gathered by EY.\n\n\"It's clear that the physical store still plays an important role,\" said EY Retail Analysts Malin Andrée and Jon Copestake. \"Not only do stores have plenty of runway left in delivering revenue, but they also have opportunities to drive new growth and alternative revenue streams and, by working in tandem with digital channels, they can maximize returns on investment.\"\n\nDespite its turnaround efforts, Kering's shares have dropped 9.25% year to date as of February 17. The stock currently carries a consensus \"hold\" rating from Wall Street analysts tracked by MarketBeat.\n\nRecently, the company underwent significant leadership changes. In September 2025, Luca de Meo replaced longtime CEO François-Henri Pinault, and creative director roles at its top three fashion houses, including Gucci, Saint Laurent, and Bottega Veneta, have also shifted.\n\n\"Kering has changed designers across its three main brands simultaneously, a risky move given the group's reliance on figures like [Deputy CEO] Francesca Bellettini, who holds significant sway over appointments and brand direction,\" said Third Bridge Luxury Apparel Analyst Yanmei Tang to Fashion Dive.\n\n\"This top-heavy approach often leads to reactive, short-term decisions aimed at plugging immediate gaps.\"\n\nGucci is Kering's largest brand, accounting for 45% of its total revenue. For years, the company has relied on its performance, leaving it vulnerable to fluctuations.\n\nIn 2025 alone, Kering appointed Francesca Bellettini as the new Gucci CEO in September, and Demna took over as the creative director in July.\n\n\"Creative transitions take time, and the retail environment has not been supportive,\" said Carrara Advisory Industry experts. \"Consumer sentiment in China weakened. U.S. aspirational buyers pulled back. European tourism shifted. This confluence of factors placed Gucci in a vulnerable position.\"",

    "title": "8 luxury crossbody bags that are worth the splurge, according to style editors",
    "description": "I prefer crossbody bags for their comfort and convenience. These luxury picks stood out for their beautiful materials and thoughtful design details.",
    "fullText": "I was standing in a shivering mass of well-dressed spectators in the Upper East Side this past New York Fashion Week. Among them I noticed a subtle trend: accessories with a practical edge, like deep pockets, adjustable fastenings, and an emphasis on comfort.\n\nLuxury crossbody bags embody this utilitarian aesthetic. You can sling one on and carry it hands-free, and because their weight is distributed more evenly than with a shoulder bag, they're also the most comfortable travel purse.\n\nBeyond their high-quality materials and stylish designs, our favorite luxury crossbody bags we've tested also come with intuitive pockets to keep you organized whether you're exploring a new city, running a quick errand, or attending a formal event.\n\nI used to be the type who would stuff everything in my pockets so I wouldn't have to hold anything while I'm out. But since investing in the form and function of a luxury crossbody bag, I can see the appeal of being a purse girl. Here are 8 splurge-worthy styles that will work hard while adding intrigue to your outfit.\n\nSee \n\nI brought along this luxury crossbody bag from Parisa Wang when I traveled to Rhode Island for my best friend's wedding. Parisa Wang partners with artisans who typically work with top luxury brands like The Row and Prada, and you can tell by the elite craftsmanship. It starts at the very bottom with tiny gold feet that protects the yummy chocolate suede from coming into contact with the floor.\n\nOn its sides are slip pockets that snap shut on their own with a satisfying magnetic closure, and inside is a wide main compartment where you can easily fit a variety of bulbous items (overpackers rejoice). The long strap is removable, so I carried it is as a handbag anytime I wasn't wearing it slung over my shoulder.\n\nThe Gabrielle comes in two larger sizes, as described by style editor Samantha Crozier in our guide to the best work bags for women. \"The Gabrielle 35 looks and feels like the ultra-coveted suede Margaux bag from The Row, which will run you $5K or more,\" she writes. '\"But dare I say that the Gabrielle is cuter?\"\n\nThis brand is literally fit for royals, as it's been spotted on Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle. It's not a traditional work bag — you won't find a padded laptop sleeve or built-in tech compartments — but the Strathberry Tote is considered a holy grail over on the Reddit's r/handbags forum as a luxury office purse.\n\nThe mid-tier luxury brand has a reputation for delivering exceptional materials and meticulous construction at a price that, while still a splurge, feels justified in the luxury space. Each Strathberry bag takes an artisan at least 20 hours to complete, and that care is evident the moment you see it up close. The stitching is precise, the leather feels rich and substantial, and the suede lining is soft to the touch.\n\nIts signature music bar hardware is weighty, polished, and unmistakably luxe — the kind of detail that elevates even the simplest outfit. It also comes in Midi and Mini sizes.\n\nTravel writer Maria Yagoda tested the best travel purses, where this versatile Lo & Sons bag came out on top. \n\n\"The interior pockets are helpfully mesh-lined so I could see where everything was the moment I opened the bag. It's hard for me to choose a favorite pocket — there are so many smart ones, including the built-in card holder,\" according to Maria.\n\n\"In addition to looking high-end, the leather feels silky-smooth and gentle on my skin. Even when I had the bag stuffed to maximum capacity, the wide adjustable strap lands really comfortably and evenly, never digging into my shoulder or back. It only weighs 10.8 ounces, which is impressive given the amount of storage options,\" she continues.\n\n\"The adjustable, removable strap clicks into the body of the bag, allowing you to wear the Aoyama as a shoulder bag or even a clutch. Having one beautiful, adaptable bag that keeps me organized from the airport to a fancy dinner saves space in my suitcase. This kind of versatility makes the $248 price tag a bit more justifiable.\"\n\nMy own favorite part about the Aoyama is its vertical zippered side pocket, where I can pull out my phone without taking the bag off my shoulder. Just don't get the Ivory colorway, since I found it stains more easily.\n\nRead \n\n\"KAAI's Rebel Crossbody is the Rolex of functional purses,\" writes style editor Samantha Crozier. The Belgian brand created this luxury crossbody bag with a unique, asymmetrical design and a long strap that can easily fit over a puffy jacket.\n\n\"Like all of KAAI's beautifully made bags, it's lined with a blue suede material that feels luxurious to the touch. On the outside, the single-source leather is treated to be resistant to weather and stains. This is super important to me, since I wouldn't carry a bag this nice outside without trusting how well the leather can stand up to the elements. But all my KAAI bags have remained like-new, even though they're some of my most used pieces,\" continues Samantha.\n\n\"The only issue with this bag is that it is relatively narrow and structured, so you won't be able to stuff it,\" she advises. \"A phone, wallet, lipstick, and keys fit perfectly, but anything bulky or irregular would prevent the bag from closing.\"\n\nI tested the Petite version of one of Clare V's bestselling styles, the Moyen Messenger. The Petit is one of my favorite crossbody bags I own, but the larger size has a more practical advantage with the same relaxed, woven leather look. And I know this bag is a hot commodity because sure enough, Quince has its own dupe. \n\nClare V. is a Los Angeles-based brand that makes what I call 'character bags.' You can build an outfit around them and make them your own with their extensive collection of interchangeable straps. I'm not a huge bag charm person myself, but the D-rings on this luxury crossbody make it the perfect backdrop for colorful key chains.\n\nThe medium-sized Moyen Messenger comes with two straps, so you can wear it as a shoulder bag or a crossbody. It has a slouchy, curved construction like the hobo bags that are making a return. Even better: the soft, flexible leather lies flat, so I'm easily able to pack it in my carry-on.\n\nThe Mini Maestra from Senreve takes modular design to another level. This 4-in-1 luxury crossbody can also be worn as a tote, satchel, or backpack, depending on whatever you need it to be. The top features a flap and the Senreve's signature studded belt closure, and inside is a zipper to secure your belongings. \n\nExecutive editor Sally Kaplan tested out the full-sized Maestra as a luxury work bag and confirmed it to be worth the splurge. Besides its fashion-forward shape, the 100% leather is seriously high-quality. It comes in both pebbled and long-grain finishes, and inside it's lined with smooth suede. This premium leather is also water-repellent, so you can wear it out in the rain without fussing over stains. Plus, it comes with a lifetime warranty.\n\nSee similar styles in our guide to the best convertible backpack tote bags.\n\nI was inspired to test out this style when I was getting ready to go out with my friend, and she asked me if my bag was a Polène. In fact, it was from Quince. But when a Quince dupe can pass for French luxury, it makes me skeptical that the real deal could be any good to begin with.\n\nInstead, I was happily proven wrong. The 'Cognac' shade of the Numéro Dix is the perfect color for people who wear similar gourmand shades like chocolate and almond. It's made with a single panel of structured, full-grain leather that has a deliciously rich sheen.\n\nIt also beats out the Quince dupe in terms of storage capacity. Because the crescent shape has a flared base, I can fill it from the bottom up with my everyday carry. I've only worn mine as a crossbody or shoulder bag, but it also converts to a belt bag and the adjustable strap extension means it can fit a tall frame. There's now a JW Pei dupe of the same style.\n\nThe real Numéro Dix feels worth the splurge because it's a true heritage piece and the materials are primed to age gracefully. The simple, stylish shape puts an elevated twist on the contemporary saddle silhouette.\n\n\"Despite its teeny-tiny silhouette, this miniature crossbody can hold a surprising amount of items,\" writes freelance style reporter Talia Ergas. If you're getting your looks together for vacation season, Talia found the artisan-made Milaner Grazia Mini to be the perfect little clutch for tying your whole outfit together.\n\n\"My iPhone fits effortlessly across the bottom, and there's plenty of room for my sunglasses, a small wallet, and some odds and ends like mints and a chapstick,\" Talia writes. \"I love this hand-woven leather bag because it has the elegance of a clutch with the ease and comfort of a crossbody bag. The strap is removable, though, which is convenient for occasions when I might prefer to swap in its shorter strap for a wristlet.\"\n\nYou can tell a luxury crossbody bag by its intuitive design details, artisan-level craftsmanship, and longevity. Our favorites are typically made from high-quality leather — like full-grain or pebbled Italian leather — and feature precise stitching, durable hardware, and thoughtfully-placed pockets. The result is a versatile accessory that will age gracefully despite regular wear.\n\nBetween small and medium is best if you want something to comfortably weigh on your shoulder. A small bag that's about 8 inches wide will fit only the essentials, but be more streamlined to carry. Medium crossbody bags of about 14 inches offer a bit more space for a small tablet or a bulky sunglasses case.\n\nA luxury crossbody bag typically uses higher-quality materials — like full-grain leather, suede lining, and solid metal accents — that hold up significantly better over time. Cheaper bags will instead use bonded leather or flimsy hardware that can peel, scratch, or tarnish quickly. If you carry a bag daily, think about in terms of cost-per-wear. The durability of a luxury crossbody bag will prove itself in the long run.\n\nCrossbodies are already practical by design — they keep your hands free, and many of our favorites can be converted into a shoulder bag. A luxury version elevates that functionality with easy-to-carry proportions, reinforced stitching, smooth straps that don't dig into your shoulder, and scratch-resistant, water-repellent materials.\n\nYes. As someone who used to try and carry everything in my pockets, I found that luxury crossbody bags are the easiest gateway into stylish personal organization — especially if you prefer a lighter load. A well-designed crossbody prioritizes smart compartments and a streamlined shape, so you don't feel the bulk as you go about your business.\n\nRead how the Reviews team tests clothing, shoes, and accessories at Business Insider.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

    "description": "American star Mikaela Shiffrin cements her status as the greatest alpine skier of all time as she wins Olympic slalom gold in emphatic fashion.",
    "fullText": "After claiming an emotional Olympic gold, Mikaela Shiffrin's thoughts turned to one person who was not there - her father, Jeff.\n\nThe American crossed the line as Olympic slalom champion, as she did 12 years ago in Sochi, aged 18.\n\nOnly this time, as she embraced her mother and coaches, she felt the absence of her dad, who passed away six years ago.\n\n\"For my dad, who didn't get to see this. This was a moment I had dreamed about. I have also been very scared of this moment,\" she said.\n\n\"Everything in life you do after you lose someone you love is like a new experience.\n\n\"It is like being born again and I still have so many moments where I resist this. I don't want to be in life without my dad and maybe today was the first time that I could actually accept this reality.\n\n\"Instead of thinking I would be in this moment without him, to take the moment to be silent with him.\"\n\nShiffrin spent almost a year away from the sport following the loss - which she referred to as an \"invisible injury\" - while she has spoken openly about her mental health struggles.\n\nHer triumph in Italy, claiming gold in emphatic style by an extraordinary 1.50sec margin, cements her name among the greats of alpine skiing.\n\nThe 30-year-old clocked an overall time of 1:39:10 to become a three-time Olympic champion, following her success in Sochi then Pyeongchang in 2018.\n\nThe eight years in between without an Olympic medal have brought many challenges for Shiffrin, within and away from the sport.\n\nBut she said the most important thing on Wednesday was to \"show up\" for the race.\n\n\"It's so much work just to show up for two runs and do something that is within me and I know how to do,\" she said.\n\n\"It is not always easy. Sometimes it feels impossible. In the end, today, it was to take away the noise and be simple with it.\"\n\nSeven-time world champion Shiffrin arrived in Cortina as the heavy favourite under significant pressure to deliver.\n\nThis season she has won seven of eight slalom World Cup races and finished second in the other to seal the overall title with races to spare.\n\nHer 108 World Cup race wins make her the world's most successful alpine skier, while she has featured on the podium a further 58 times and won the overall title five times.\n\nBut the unwanted tagline of 'being unable to perform on the big stage' has followed her since she failed to win a medal in Beijing four years ago.\n\nShiffrin crashed out of both the giant slalom and slalom events just seconds into the runs, completing six races but returning home without a medal.\n\nBehind the scenes, Shiffrin was still struggling to come to terms with the loss of her father and said she suffered with memory issues, which meant she would struggle to remember courses.\n\nThen, having overcome that to become \"stronger as a person\" and closing in on a 100th World Cup race win, she crashed in a giant slalom race in Killington in December 2024, sustaining a puncture wound and muscle damage to her stomach.\n\nAgain, Shiffrin's mental health suffered and she said she had visions of her crashing and a fear of doing it again.\n\nEven enjoying a remarkably successful season this year, questions remained around whether Shiffrin could return to the top of the Olympic podium after things did not initially go to plan for her in Cortina.\n\nShe finished 11th in the giant slalom and an agonising fourth in the team event alongside Olympic downhill champion Breezy Johnson.\n\nBut in her favoured event, where she has 71 World Cup race wins, the most by any alpine skier in any discipline, Shiffrin was able to block out the noise and \"just ski\".\n\n\"I wanted to be free, I wanted to unleash.

    "fullText": "Prof Michael Wooldridge says scenario such as deadly self-driving car update or AI hack could destroy global interest\n\nThe race to get artificial intelligence to market has raised the risk of a Hindenburg-style disaster that shatters global confidence in the technology, a leading researcher has warned.\n\nMichael Wooldridge, a professor of AI at Oxford University, said the danger arose from the immense commercial pressures that technology firms were under to release new AI tools, with companies desperate to win customers before the products’ capabilities and potential flaws are fully understood.\n\nThe surge in AI chatbots with guardrails that are easily bypassed showed how commercial incentives were prioritised over more cautious development and safety testing, he said.\n\n“It’s the classic technology scenario,” he said. “You’ve got a technology that’s very, very promising, but not as rigorously tested as you would like it to be, and the commercial pressure behind it is unbearable.”\n\nWooldridge, who will deliver the Royal Society’s Michael Faraday prize lecture on Wednesday evening, titled “This is not the AI we were promised”, said a Hindenburg moment was “very plausible” as companies rushed to deploy more advanced AI tools.\n\nThe Hindenburg, a 245-metre airship that made round trips across the Atlantic, was preparing to land in New Jersey in 1937 when it burst into flames, killing 36 crew, passengers and ground staff. The inferno was caused by a spark that ignited the 200,000 cubic metres of hydrogen that kept the airship aloft.\n\n“The Hindenburg disaster destroyed global interest in airships; it was a dead technology from that point on, and a similar moment is a real risk for AI,” Wooldridge said. Because AI is embedded in so many systems, a major incident could strike almost any sector.\n\nThe scenarios Wooldridge imagines include a deadly software update for self-driving cars, an AI-powered hack that grounds global airlines, or a Barings bank-style collapse of a major company, triggered by AI doing something stupid. “These are very, very plausible scenarios,” he said. “There are all sorts of ways AI could very publicly go wrong.”\n\nDespite the concerns, Wooldridge said he did not intend to attack modern AI. His starting point is the gap between what researchers expected and what has emerged. Many experts anticipated AI that computed solutions to problems and provided answers that were sound and complete. “Contemporary AI is neither sound nor complete: it’s very, very approximate,” he said.\n\nThis arises because large language models, which underpin today’s AI chatbots, rattle out answers by predicting the next word, or part of a word, based on probability distributions learned in training. It leads to AIs with jagged capabilities: incredibly effective at some tasks, yet terrible at others.\n\nThe problem, Wooldridge said, was that AI chatbots failed in unpredictable ways and had no idea when they were wrong, but were designed to provide confident answers regardless. When delivered in human-like and sycophantic responses, the answers could easily mislead people, he added. The risk is that people start treating AIs as if they were human. In a 2025 survey by the Center for Democracy and Technology, nearly a third of students reported that they or a friend had had a romantic relationship with an AI.\n\n“Companies want to present AIs in a very human-like way, but I think that is a very dangerous path to take,” Wooldridge said. “We need to understand that these are just glorified spreadsheets, they are tools and nothing more than that.”\n\nWooldridge sees positives in the kind of AI depicted in the early years of Star Trek. In one 1968 episode, The Day of the Dove, Mr Spock quizzes the Enterprise’s computer only to be told in a distinctly non-human voice that it has insufficient data to answer. “That’s not what we get. We get an overconfident AI that says: yes, here’s the answer,” he said. “Maybe we need AIs to talk to us in the voice of the Star Trek computer. You would never believe it was a human being.”",

    "fullText": "Thousands of people are rallying behind a version of ChatGPT after its parent company, OpenAI, retired the model.\n\nOpenAI said on January 30 that GPT-4o would be deprecated alongside three other versions of that model on February 13.\n\nA petition calling on OpenAI to save GPT-4o has amassed roughly 21,900 signatures on Change.org as of Tuesday.\n\n\"For many of us, GPT-4o offers a unique and irreplaceable user experience, combining qualities and capabilities that we value, regardless of performance benchmarks,\" the petition's description says.\n\nOpenAI wrote in a 2025 blog post that the model was known for \"responses that were overly supportive but disingenuous.\"\n\nThe company first set out to sunset GPT-4o last year, but fans pleaded to save it. In response, OpenAI brought the model back for several more months before its latest announcement.\n\nThe petition, created in April 2025 by Sophie Witt, reached 12,500 supporters two weeks ago, after OpenAI shared its latest plans to retire the model, and has continued to climb since.\n\nOn February 2, Witt called on supporters to take collective action against OpenAI's decision by posting about GPT-4o on X.\n\nWitt did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOpenAI gave GPT-4o a shoutout in its January 30 blog post, saying that many users told the company they like the model's \"conversational style and warmth\" last year. The ChatGPT maker said that feedback helped shape the GPT‑5.1 and GPT‑5.2 models.\n\nThe company cited low usage of GPT-4o as another reason for its retirement, reporting that only 0.1% of users still choose GPT‑4o.\n\nThe last time GPT-4o was retired, CEO Sam Altman was bombarded during an ask-me-anything session on Reddit with calls to reinstate it.\n\nThe calls for its return have been renewed through comments from social media users and petition signees. Some said it felt more like losing a friend than a feature. Other paying ChatGPT users said they'd be canceling their subscriptions in response to the retirement of GPT-4o.\n\n\"No 4o, no money. I will not spend another single penny on OpenAI,\" one X user posted.",

    "description": "I moved to New York City to pursue a career in fashion journalism. After a few years at my \"dream job,\" I felt burned out and had to redefine success.",
    "fullText": "Ever since I heard Taylor Swift's \"Welcome to New York\" for the first time, the city called my name.\n\nOf course, I was grateful for my suburban upbringing in California, but my town was too small for my aspirations. I wanted to live the life of a fashion journalist, and to me, that required being in New York City.\n\nFixated on my goal, I mapped out a plan in college to secure as many internships and part-time writing gigs as possible, then fling the industry door wide open.\n\nI went on to land a job at a Los Angeles public relations agency before breaking into editorial with a remote position at a lifestyle publication. Then, a few months later, I got a job at one of NYC's most prominent newspapers. It wasn't strictly focused on fashion, but it was my entry point.\n\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic meant I had to spend the first six months working from California, I was excited to move to New York as soon as possible.\n\nWithout knowing a single soul, I set off to the concrete jungle, armed with sheer ambition, nerves, and the belief that if I worked hard enough, I'd have that movie montage moment (cue \"Empire State of Mind\").\n\nI moved into an apartment on my own, and just like that, I was enveloped by the glittering scene that came with the gig, staring at my laptop until my eyes stung with tears and rubbing elbows with Hollywood's elite. It was a thrill, to say the least, but I still had my eyes on fashion.\n\nOne year later, I pulled it off, landing a role at the glossy I'd been collecting for nearly a decade.\n\nWithin days, my life changed: I was sitting front row at New York Fashion Week and juggling an output that seemed to multiply tenfold — making my heart race so fast my Oura ring began to flag stress spikes.\n\nThis new life shimmered from miles away, with friends and family saying, \"Your life is like a movie.\" By the world's standards, I had \"made it,\" but underneath the dazzling designer façade was a quiet truth no one had prepared me for.\n\nAttaining everything I'd dreamed of by 26 meant drowning in a sea of deadlines, navigating corporate politics, and feeling pressured to sustain my success — smack dab in the middle of a quarter-life crisis.\n\nThe increasing number of industry-wide layoffs also nixed the possibility of a promotion despite my best efforts. Still, the work accelerated and my responsibilities expanded. I was left feeling overlooked and depleted — and my mental health suffered.\n\nI began to question who I was apart from my career, if I wasn't climbing (and rising) to the top. What's worse is that this feeling began to seep into other areas of my life, feeding the lie that I didn't measure up.\n\nThat's when I realized \"making it\" couldn't be as simple as owning luxury handbags, interviewing stars, and typing up thousands of stories.\n\nInstead of feeling fulfilled, I was left with a strange ache that the life I'd worked so hard to achieve wasn't enough. So, I started re-evaluating how I wanted to live, my values, and where I saw myself in five years.\n\nI decided my next move would have to allow me to do what I love and still prioritize the other elements of my life that make me me: family, friendships, hobbies, and faith.\n\nStill, entertaining the concept of \"what comes next\" was unsettling, especially considering I'd up and moved my entire life just a few years prior, and I genuinely adored writing and style.\n\nI wondered whether pursuing something new would be a failure or if people would think I was weak. This inner debate gnawed at me for months, while work opportunities that once thrilled me felt like extra weight.\n\nBut finally, it clicked. Making a career change wouldn't be quitting or failing — I'd already clawed my way to the big leagues and thrived — and my purpose came from much more than my work.\n\nSo, nearly a year later, I left my dream job to freelance within the fashion space, deciding to stay within the industry and city I love — but on my own terms. Still, I'll always be grateful for the early years of my career; I couldn't have pursued my new path without them.\n\nAnd I know this won't be the final shift I make in my life, because it's the bends in the road that make it meaningful.\n\nAs it turns out, \"making it\" is a milestone that can be continually redefined, and landing my \"dream job\" was only the beginning of the story.",

In the past Starmer has just said that he would like to do this at some point in the next parliament.\nIn his reply, Starmer said that at the Munich Security Conference over the weekend he was arguing that the UK, and Europe as a whole, needs to “step up”.\nWe want a just and lasting peace, but that will not extinguish the Russian threat, and we need to be alert to that, because that’s going to affect every single person in this room, every single person in this country, so we need to step up.\nThat means, on defence spending, we need to go faster.",

He said:\n\nWe’ve taken the powers to make sure we can act within months, not years.\n\nWe also need to act very quickly, not just of the age concern, but on the devices and applications that make the sort of auto-scrolling, the constant glueing to the machine that you can never stop scrolling.\n\nIn a post on his Substack account, Starmer said out in more details the options that could be implemented as a result of the consultation being carried out. He said:\n\nWe will be going to parliament for new government powers, enabling us to act on the findings of the social media consultation where the evidence suggests we need to. This could include:\n\n-Setting a minimum age limit for social media: unlike the Tories, who took years to pass the Online Safety Act, we will take powers that would allow us to implement a minimum age for social media in a matter of months to prevent kids from accessing harmful social media.\n\n-Restricting specific functionalities: that are detrimental to kids’ wellbeing and keep them hooked to their screens like endless scroll or autoplay\n\n-Limiting VPN access for kids: to make it harder for kids to get around age limits of services or certain functionalities.\n\nThis is all designed to put the wellbeing of children first.",

    "description": "James Eagle founded UK artisan brand The Pished Fish in 2014 and is known for its booze-infused, Scandinavian style smoked salmon.",
    "fullText": "As a medical devices salesman, James Eagle travelled across Scandinavia and would frequently be met with salmon or gravlax as “the main event” on menus.\n\nBack in the UK, he felt that thinly-cut smoked salmon was a sidenote on our plates. “I always thought that was a shame,” says Eagle.\n\nRedundancy from his sales job in 2013 allowed Eagle to start a smokehouse from a small shed at the bottom of his garden in Camberwell, London, which turned from a hobby into the birth of his artisan brand – The Pished Fish.\n\n“In the UK, when you get a smoked salmon and cream cheese bagel, it’s the cream cheese and bagel you can taste,” adds Eagle. “How I likened it is with wafer-thin smoked salmon almost melting into the bagel.”\n\nEagle, who didn’t complete university, worked for drum and bass label Good Looking Records in the early 2000s and was PA to musician LTJ Bukem before turning to a career in sales.\n\nHowever, being laid off at the medical devices firm left a “sour taste” and taught him a lesson in \"how to look after my own staff now.”\n\nIn late 2014, Eagle ventured to farmers' markets with homemade smoked salmon made in what he describes as a “glorified filing cabinet” smoker. He would start at 1am for the laborious 16-hour process.\n\nHe produced three different flavours, sold out every weekend and it gave Eagle the confidence that a more lucrative business was in the offing.\n\nThe Pished Fish’s USP is using botanicals and alcohol – hence the fun company name – such as whisky, aquavit and vodka to flavour its booze-infused, Scandinavian-style smoked salmon. “The ones which I thought were more fun were done with alcohol,” he recalls of his early smokehouse testing.\n\nAfter meeting his now wife, Hermione, through dating site My Single Friend, the couple had attended a course on how to start a food business. Eagle’s main takeaway was not to rely on the product but to have a compelling brand.\n\nHe spent £4,000 on a design and logo. “Having someone to properly imagine what it could be was really important,” he says. “I felt it was an awful amount of money at the time, but it was the best money you could spend.”\n\nWhen a fishmonger at Selfridges later spotted the brand, the Eagles moved to East Sussex and went full-time to upscale the business. The start-up was housed on his father’s land near the Sussex Downs, at first in two shipping containers before moving to an adjacent building where Eagle today employs eight full-time staff.",

So what did Death Stranding 2 originally look like? For starters, it would have involved a lot more high-end fashion for its protagonist, Sam Porter Bridges, and his allies.\nKojima recently posted images online from the upcoming Death Stranding 2 art book, showing off a \"pre-COVID\" look at Bridges and Fragile.",

    "fullText": "She attended the designer's fall runway show wearing a high-neck halter gown made from gauze-like fabric.\n\nIt wrapped around her body, creating a subtle see-through effect, and its skirt extended into a short train.\n\nShe wore it with a fuzzy jacket that she carried around her waist.\n\nShe made an appearance at the Tory Burch fall/winter runway show wearing a preppy look from the brand. It comprised a white pleated skirt with a black, button-up blouse tucked in.\n\nUnfortunately, the two pieces sat loosely on Anderson and appeared too formal.\n\nHer leather belt, sheer tights, pointed heels, and black purse added some fun to the look, but the base layers were ultimately too simple for them to work.\n\nWhile entering the Ralph Lauren show, Reinhart was photographed wearing a brown tweed blazer as a top with a thick brown belt holding it closed at the waist.\n\nShe also wore a long black skirt covered in leather fringe, which added texture and contrast to the ensemble.\n\nHigh black boots and a small brown purse completed the fun, fashion-forward look.\n\nAlso at the Tory Burch show, Seyfried wore a golden, long-sleeved blouse atop a blue midi skirt with silver stripes. She also wore white heels with silver adornments and carried a blue purse.\n\nThe mix of two metallic shades with blue tones created a unique, fun color combination that complemented her hair and skin tone.\n\nOutside the Tory Burch runway show, the Olympic gymnast was photographed wearing an oversize blue jacket with a form-fitting wrap skirt in a vibrant red shade.\n\nThe two pieces were drastically different in style, and they overwhelmed her petite frame. They also didn't match the lime-green top she wore or her black accessories.\n\nThe \"Stranger Things\" actor attended the show in blue jeans, a button-up top, and a leather jacket that matched his sneakers and Coach purse.\n\nThe latter piece was especially fun. It featured a prominent pocket reminiscent of a coin purse and two keychains that looked like miniature books.\n\nMcLaughlin has been one of the best-dressed men at New York Fashion Week so far.\n\nThe model sat in the stands wearing skinny black pants with a billowing blouse. The semi-sheer white garment had a high neckline, balloon sleeves, and extra fabric at the waist that extended into a train.\n\nThe top piece was dramatic and memorable, while her pants were perfectly tailored to highlight her dramatically pointed heels.\n\nFor the Michael Kors runway show, the actor wore an all-white ensemble that included trousers, a loose-fitting blouse, sneakers, and a trench coat.\n\nThe outfit would have worked for him if it featured more than one color. Because the entire ensemble was stark white, each piece blended into the others, creating the illusion that he was wearing a baggy jumpsuit.",

    "fullText": "COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) — Bob Evans, the chain of family-style restaurants founded and headquartered in central Ohio, has a new owner.\n\nNew York-based investment firm 4×4 Capital announced on Feb. 4 that it has acquired Bob Evans Restaurants. The deal transfers ownership of the 78-year-old brand from San Francisco-based private equity firm Golden Gate Capital. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\n\nBob Evans operates more than 400 restaurants in 18 states and employs more than 15,000 people. The company is based in New Albany and traces its roots to a 12-stool diner opened in 1948 by founder Bob Evans in Gallipolis, Ohio.\n\nDublin keeps Irish Festival ticket prices unchanged for 2026\n\n“We are proud of what we accomplished in partnership with Golden Gate Capital and excited to begin this next chapter with 4×4’s hands-on partnership,” said Mickey Mills, the restaurant chain’s CEO, who will continue to lead the brand. “Together, we look forward to investing in and enhancing our operations, guest experience, and brand.”\n\nGolden Gate Capital purchased Bob Evans in 2017 for $565 million. At the time, the firm split the restaurants from Bob Evans Farms, the brand’s consumer-packaged good business, which was acquired by Post Holdings for $1.5 billion.\n\nIn 2022, Golden Gate explored a potential $600 million sale of the restaurant chain, though a transaction did not materialize. Reports in 2024 indicated the company had hired investment bank Kroll to oversee another sale process.\n\n“We are truly grateful to the terrific team at Bob Evans for their strong stewardship of this iconic brand,” said Neale Attenborough, a managing director at Golden Gate. “We wish the team all the best as they enter their next phase of growth.”\n\n‘Love is Blind’ fans buzzing over central Ohio ties\n\nBob Evans boasts itself as a farm-inspired, family-style restaurant brand known for breakfast offerings, such as its Farmer’s Choice Breakfast, and roasted turkey dinners.\n\n4×4 Capital, founded in 2018, focuses on investing in middle-market consumer goods and services companies across North America. The firm said it takes an active ownership approach aimed at accelerating growth and operational performance.\n\n“What truly sets the Bob Evans brand apart is its distinctive hospitality, welcoming ambiance, and fresh, flavorful food — delivering real value for the whole family,” said Gustavo Assumpção, co-founder and partner at 4×4 Capital, who will serve as executive board chair. “We look forward to partnering with Mickey and the team to maximize long-term growth.”",

    "description": "Matt Weston cements his status as the best skeleton racer in the world, making history by winning Olympic gold in emphatic fashion in Cortina and securing Team GB’s first medal of the 2026 Winter Games.",
    "fullText": "Standing at the top of the winding Cortina sliding track with Olympic gold in his sights, Matt Weston knew what he had to do.\n\nHaving laid the foundations for skeleton gold on Thursday - tidying up errors from his first run to produce a statement second, each time setting the track record - the Briton merely needed more of the same on Friday.\n\nWhat he produced was not only a masterclass in sliding but also a remarkable display of composure and focus to clinch gold - Team GB's first medal of the Games - and cement his place at the top of the sport.\n\n\"It means everything. It means a hell of a lot to me personally, I've worked so hard for this,\" Weston told BBC Sport.\n\n\"But everyone back home - my fiancee, my family, my friends, everyone who has sacrificed everything for this. I've missed funerals, birthdays, everything for this moment. It feels amazing. Hopefully I made you proud.\"\n\nWeston set a track record on all four of his runs and could have eased off in his final attempt having already built a significant margin of 0.39 seconds, but ramped things up on what was ultimately a victory lap lasting 55.61secs, finishing with a sensational overall time of 3:43.33.\n\nIt left an almost impossible task for the chasing pack and Germany's Axel Jungk finished 0.88secs behind to take silver, while compatriot and defending Olympic champion Christopher Grotheer secured bronze, 1.07secs behind Weston.\n\nThe pressure to deliver was there. The 28-year-old from Redhill was the heavy favourite to top the podium in Italy having dominated the sport in the past four-year cycle, but no British man had won an Olympic skeleton gold medal before.\n\nHe also carried the weight of Team GB teetering on the edge of overall disappointment at the Games, having been tipped for a record medal haul at Milan-Cortina but watching those ambitions begin to slip away.\n\nWeston blocked out the noise of 'helmet-gate', of seeing his peer Vladyslav Heraskevych disqualified from the competition just moments before the first heat, and of the disaster that was Beijing 2022, where GB failed to win a skeleton medal for the first time since 2002.\n\nHe put it all aside to add the Olympic crown to his two World Championship titles and three Crystal Globes - the overall World Cup trophies.\n\nFour years ago, it was a different story.\n\nHis overwhelming disappointment at missing out on the Olympic podium almost led to him quitting the sport and he told BBC Sport earlier this year he has had to teach himself to \"love the pressure and expectation\".\n\nFrom speaking to friends and family to knowing when to rest and eating lots of pasta, Weston has figured out the secret to his own success, and now he's reaping the rewards.\n\nThe new champion knows what it feels like to walk away from an Olympics empty-handed, having finished 15th at his maiden Games in Beijing.\n\nKnowing he did not want to feel that again, he has worked on switching his mentality and says that has paved the way for his success.\n\nIn 2023 he became Britain's first men's world champion in 15 years, taking silver the following year but reclaiming his title in 2025.\n\nHis first World Cup title came in 2024 and he has been unrivalled since, earlier this year becoming the first man to defend the trophy twice - winning five of the seven races this season and finishing second in the other two.\n\nArriving at this Games as reigning world, European and World Cup champion, the pressure was on to deliver.\n\n\"I have taught myself to love the pressure and love the expectation I have on my shoulders,\" Weston told BBC Sport after run two on Thursday.\n\n\"I didn't like it when I first had success, but now I have turned it into fire that I can go out and give my best.\"\n\nHe represented England at taekwondo as a teenager, winning various medals at national level, but a back injury brought that particular sporting career to an end.\n\nHe was also a gifted rugby player but, like many skeleton racers, it was through a talent identification programme that Weston discovered his love and aptitude for the winter sport nine years ago.\n\nQuickly rising up the sport came with its own issues and, following that disappointing result four years ago, Weston had to learn to embrace the pressure and, once winning became the norm, carry the weight of being the favourite.\n\nThat attitude has served him well in Italy as he has been able to block out the noise, pointing to enjoyment as the key to his success.\n\nIt has not just been on the track where Weston has blocked out the noise.\n\nThe build-up to the Olympic event was dominated by discussion around the British team's desire to a wear a new helmet design in Italy.\n\nThey ultimately lost an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), banning them from wearing their new helmet.\n\nWeston and team-mate Marcus Wyatt, who was also tipped for success but finished ninth, were confident it would not make a difference, pointing to the triumphs they have enjoyed all season.\n\nThat came before Weston saw Ukrainian Heraskevych disqualified moments before the men's competition started on Thursday.\n\nAnd after a week of no medals for the British team in Italy, pressure on Weston gradually increased.\n\nBut he knew what he needed to do to win gold, stating he would settle for nothing less in Cortina.\n\nThat doesn't always mean being the first to arrive at the track and the last to leave.\n\nHe sat out Wednesday's final training runs in favour of a rest, opting for some light stretching and mental respite by speaking to his fiance about anything other than sliding.\n\nPlus, eating a lot of pasta, abiding by his motto \"pasta makes you faster\".\n\nUltimately, skeleton training is tricky, particularly for a British athlete.\n\nWith no ice tracks in Britain - only a push-start track at the University of Bath - a lot of time is spent in the gym working on speed and explosiveness to improve that all-important start.\n\nWith one run down the icy track taking less than a minute, it means the British sliders spend around two and a half hours per year actually completing runs and a lot of time visualising the track, understanding the twists and turns to make for a seamless run.\n\nBut Weston has got his rituals down to a tee and not only is he the first British man to win winter gold since Christopher Dean topped the ice dancing podium alongside Jayne Torvill in 1984, but also the first British man to win skeleton gold.\n\nHis success may not end there, as he partners Amelia Coltman in the mixed team event, newly introduced for Milan-Cortina, on Sunday.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Tottenham Hotspur are searching for a new manager following the dismissal of Thomas Frank.\n\nThe Danish tactician was never the right fit at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nHis route-one style of play was not the ideal tactical approach for a team that wants to play front-foot football.\n\nWith Frank’s chapter at Spurs now closed, the North London club must ensure it does not get it wrong with its next pick.\n\nTottenham’s decision-making at the top hasn’t really inspired confidence, but if they pick the wrong man, it could set the club back for years.\n\nTottenham need a forward-thinking, tactically grounded, and experienced figure to turn the tide and return the club to the upper echelons of the Premier League.\n\nThe former Brighton & Hove Albion manager is a well-respected tactician who has shown he can deliver attacking football.\n\n“His sides have a strong identity; they play really good football,” coaching great Carlo Ancelotti said regarding De Zerbi (via Football Italia).\n\nAnother legendary coach, Pep Guardiola, had also lauded De Zerbi, calling him one of the coaches he admires most in world football.\n\nDe Zerbi famously led Brighton to the Europa League and earned plaudits for his work with the Seagulls.\n\nHis tenure in Marseille ended poorly, but his first season with the club was quite memorable.\n\nThis Tottenham squad is crying out for De Zerbi’s tactical nuance after looking inept under Ange Postecoglou and Frank.\n\nThe 46-year-old is the kind of forward-thinking hire the club needs.\n\nThe idea of Mauricio Pochettino should be shelved. Nostalgia should not rule such an important decision.\n\nDe Zerbi is the way to go, and Spurs should be doing everything to get him to sign on the dotted line.\n\nEven if he is not keen on taking on a new job immediately, Spurs must find an interim to hold the seat for him until the end of the season.",

    "fullText": "Bruce Mouat recovered from his Winter Olympics mixed doubles disappointment in some style, delivering an accomplished display to lead his Team GB men's rink to a 9-4 victory in their opening match against China.\n\nLittle more than 24 hours earlier, Mouat and Jen Dodds had faltered in the bronze-medal match in the Cortina Curling Stadium for the second successive Games.\n\nBut the 31-year-old showed why he is considered one of the world's best, as the gold-medal favourites started strongly in their attempt to upgrade the silver they won in Beijing four years ago.\n\nThe Scots, world champions in three of the past five years, traded points with China in the opening two ends, before a classily compiled three in the third cleaved open an advantage that they would never cede.\n\nThey led 5-2 at the break, then a magnificent double take-out and composed closing throw by Mouat extended the advantage to 8-3 after seven.\n\nA judicious set of throws limited the Chinese to one in the eighth but GB closed down the ninth end, taking one to force a round of handshakes with an end to spare.\n\nIt always looked like being a mismatch and so it proved. But a tougher test lies in wait on Thursday, when Mouat and his boys face Sweden - who beat them in the 2022 final - at 13:05 GMT live on the BBC.\n\nHow Team GB is leading the way in curling's arms race\n\n'Don't be afraid of being different, it's your superpower'\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Hollywood is gearing up for the 2026 Oscars in style.\n\nThe Academy Awards aren't until March, but on Tuesday, the 2026 nominees gathered at the Beverly Hilton Hotel for the Oscar Nominees Luncheon.\n\nMany of the stars of the year's biggest movies looked giddy as they walked the red carpet for the event, celebrating their nominations.\n\nHowever, some stars' outfits for the event were more stylish than others. Take a look at the best and worst looks of the luncheon.\n\nChalamet's blue Givenchy suit worked in theory, as he gave it a slightly more casual feel by wearing no tie, unbuttoning his sleeves, and leaving one of the double-breasted buttons undone.\n\nHowever, the suit ended up looking a bit disheveled, particularly because its oversize fit swallowed Chalamet's frame. The \"Marty Supreme\" nominee could have pulled off the wider fit if he had styled it more formally, or he could have worn a slimmer fit with the same relaxed styling.\n\nTaylor continued her slew of stylish red-carpet looks with an all-black ensemble from Cong Tri.\n\nThe bodice featured an unbuttoned blouse made of a leather-like material that cinched at her waist before flowing into a semi-sheer, floor-length skirt. She brought some fun to the look with a sequin-covered coat, which she wore on her shoulders.\n\nThe actor is a first-time Oscars nominee for her performance in \"One Battle After Another.\"\n\nHudson's bright-red gown from Lanvin was a great choice for the luncheon, with an Old Hollywood feel from its sleeveless, boat neckline and ruching at the waistline. Her sideswept hair played up the aesthetic.\n\nHowever, the \"Song Sung Blue\" nominee's accessories detracted from the look. Her black belt, black gloves, and white-and-black shoes just didn't fit the dress' glamorous feel.\n\nSwapping the accessories for subtler options would have allowed the dress to shine more.\n\nThe \"Sinners\" nominee walked the luncheon red carpet in a Balenciaga suit with David Yurman accessories.\n\nHis double-breasted suit had a subtle twill pattern, and he wore it with a black tank top instead of a button-down to dress it down a bit.\n\nA red floral brooch brought a pop of color to Jordan's ensemble.\n\nEjae, who is Oscar-nominated for her song \"Golden\" from \"KPop Demon Hunters,\" wore a cream suit to the luncheon.\n\nHer pinstripe blazer and pants both had a long look, and she paired them with a slightly darker polka dot top. She wore the shirt unbuttoned, revealing a lacy bustier.\n\nSnakeskin shoes, a brooch, and simple earrings tied the look together.\n\nThe \"Weapons\" actor chose a silver Thom Browne suit, which consisted of a jacket, high-waisted pants, and a tie. All three pieces were covered in a floral pattern that shimmered on the red carpet. She paired the suit with a white blouse, gray-and-white shoes, and tinted glasses.\n\nAlthough the floral pattern was pretty, the blazer, pants, and tie together looked overwhelming. If Madigan had paired the jacket and tie with simpler pants, they may have worked better together.\n\nNominated for her performance in \"Bugonia,\" Stone walked the red carpet in a black minidress from Julie de Libran couture.\n\nThe dress mimicked the shape of a blazer, with a plunging neckline lined with lapels and pockets on either side of her hips. A large rosette sat at the center of the low neckline, and Stone added more feminine details with sheer black tights and strappy heels.",

    "description": "Dress pants are a must-have menswear staple, whether you wear them daily or not. The best pairs for men are timeless in style and comfortable to wear.",
    "fullText": "The best dress pants for men should look clean and sophisticated, whether worn in a business casual setting, on date night, or at a social event. They should also be comfortable and easy to clean. Great dress pants are a critical part of any wardrobe, because even the most stylish dress shirt needs a strong supporting cast.\n\nOur favorite pair is from Mizzen+Main, a menswear brand we love for its comfortable and stretchy office clothes. The Mizzen+Main Helmsman Chino pants are stretchy, lightweight, and breathable, while still looking traditional, which makes them ideal for warmer summer weather. Below, we've rounded up the best dress pants for men, an essential element in any workwear wardrobe.\n\nLightweight takes on a whole new meaning with these airy, four-way stretch pants you've got to try on to believe.\n\nThis versatile pair of chinos features invisible side seams and an elastic waist in dense cotton twill that is wrinkle and dust resistant.\n\nThe Gamechanger Rec Pant is as stretchy and comfortable as your favorite sweatpants, but looks like traditional dress pants.\n\nLightweight takes on a whole new meaning with these airy, four-way stretch pants you've got to try on to believe.\n\nEven the best dress pants can sometimes feel cumbersome in extreme heat, but Mizzen + Main seems to have the right response figured out. Featuring a four-way stretch blend of polyester and spandex that feels light as air and breathes easily, the Helmsman Chinos are incredibly comfortable, while retaining the polished look of a traditional five-pocket chino. They're also designed to resist wrinkles, which is great for staying sharp all day long. All of that, plus the added benefit of many colors available, makes them the best we've tested — especially if you want to fill out your wardrobe for the work week.\n\nThis versatile pair of chinos features invisible side seams and an elastic waist in dense cotton twill that is wrinkle and dust resistant.\n\nUniqlo is known for its stylish staples at affordable prices, and the Slim-Fit Chinos are no different. They feature side-seam detailing, like classic dress pants, plus a relatively tailored slim-straight cut. We also love that Uniqlo offers free alterations if the off-the-rack sizing needs to be tweaked to your liking. While they're not as stretchy or wrinkle-resistant as performance pairs, they're comfortable enough for daily wears, and the price tag makes it easy to buy multiple pairs at once.\n\nThe Gamechanger Rec Pant is as stretchy and comfortable as your favorite sweatpants, but looks like traditional dress pants.\n\nPublic Rec's Gamechanger Rec Pants are designed to be as comfortable as sweatpants, but with specific waist and inseam sizes, they'll fit perfectly like dress pants. The material is incredibly stretchy, which is excellent for mobility, comfort, and resisting wrinkles. If you've been looking for the cheat code to wearing sweatpants to your corporate office, this is it.\n\nRead our full review of the Public Rec Gamechanger Rec Pant.\n\nMade with 100% wool, the Lakeshore pants feature a slim fit with a timeless pinstriped pattern.\n\nWool can sometimes be famously uncomfortable, but The Tie Bar's Lakeshore Pants feature a brushed finish that keeps them soft and comfortable against the skin. The streamlined cut through the hips and thighs keeps the look modern and flattering without being too tight for most men. The striped pattern leans into the classic satorial styling, but leaves room for more casual alternative outfits. If you are going for a fully polished look, you can pair them with The Tie Bar's Lakeshore Jacket for an affordably priced, complete suit.\n\nDress pants remained essentially unchanged for years, often made of classic wool, until  Ministry of Supply came along and changed the game. They've quite literally engineered a new way to think about dress pants, using wrinkle-resistant, 4-way stretch fabric boasting next-level features like natural odor control. Yet, they still feature timeless dress pant details like front slash pockets and two clean, sharp fit options. They should be comfortable enough for all-day wear and even business travel.\n\nRead more about the Ministry of Supply in our review of the best work clothes for men,\n\nSome dress pants separate themselves from the pack with a super-crisp design. In fact, it's hard not to love sharp, dressy, creased-front pants. The BOSS brand and its subsets, like the Genius line, specialize in these. Wool fabric is elevated even further with a comfortable stretch, turning these into comfortable pants fit for day-to-night wear.\n\nIndochino is known for its custom, made-to-measure menswear. You've got the world of premium tailored style at your fingertips, so to speak, with customizable options from Indochino. It's easier and more efficient than ever to add a little flair to your rotation of the best dress pants for men, with customizable fabric and lining options available. And seeing as these pants already come in Indochino's excellent cashmere blend, you're already starting at a proper jumping-off point.\n\nThe Apparel Skyline Pants are an eye-catching take on classic men's dress pants.\n\nY.Chroma Apparel is all about reimagining what you thought you knew about menswear. The brand is bold and vibrant, taking cues from surf and skate culture yet putting a refined spin on those typically youthful pursuits. That approach manifests itself in the visually appealing Skyline Pants, which are classic enough to wear with chunky leather loafers and edgy enough to wear with beat-up dress boots. They're stitched in Bulgaria from a blend of cotton and Italian elastane, and Y.Chroma's color selection is simply immaculate.\n\nSqueezing into suit pants or finding dress pants that fit was once a chore for guys with larger thighs and a more athletic build. And yet, State and Liberty was founded with a laser-sharp focus on solving that problem, from blazers to dress shirts and these expertly cut dress pants. The performance-blend fabric moves with you and offers a tapered fit with plenty of room (but not too much), while these can easily be paired with a State and Liberty blazer for a cool, tailored look.\n\nIs it possible for a pair of the best dress pants to actually be, well — more casual? In the hands of Mugsy, the answer is a resounding yes. The brand's thin wale stretch corduroy boasts the eye-catching texture of corduroy, but the lightweight stretch fabric makes them a reliable option for chilly fall and winter days, too. Plus, the five-pocket design and washed-out colorway are both slightly more laidback if you prefer a pair of dress pants with a (slightly) more easygoing look.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

    "fullText": "Manchester United have won four games on the bounce under Michael Carrick, something the team never managed under former head coach Ruben Amorim.\n\nMichael Carrick has restored the club’s DNA, with the Red Devils winning games late on while breaking down stubborn defences with ease.\n\nThe manner of the four victories and the opposition they have come against have impressed one and all, including United players.\n\nHarry Maguire was asked about what Carrick got right instantly as opposed to the Portuguese, and the former skipper pointed to the work rate put in by the players as a unit while defending.\n\nHe cited the team’s defending in the box, claiming the 20-time English league champions are far more aggressive now as compared to under Amorim.\n\n“I think we’ve got to be comfortable to be dominant with the ball but also without the ball and also be a threat,’ Maguire told TNT Sports. “We also know we’re going to be a threat on the counter-attack with our players.\n\n“Taking the lead against Manchester City and then we were happy to soak up a little bit of pressure and be comfortable defending our box.\n\n“I think that’s the main thing that’s improved over the last three games. We’ve defended our box a lot better with a lot more urgency. Previously we defended our box nowhere near good enough, every time the ball went in the box they had a chance.\n\n“But the last three games, loads more urgency. Not just from the defenders, from the midfielders, the wide men getting back in, the strikers protecting the edge of the box, I think it’s so important we do it as a team.”\n\nThe most important change has been United’s tactical flexibility, as opposed to playing in Amorim’s rigid 3-4-3 system.\n\nUnder the former United midfielder, the Old Trafford side have played a fluid front four, while playing in a different way in each game.\n\nUnited defended narrow against Manchester City and Arsenal, while looking to play on the counter. It was a different approach against both Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur, where they enjoyed more of the ball.\n\n“We’ve got to make sure we get the spaces right all over the pitch. We’ve got to make sure we’re compact, in a mid block, a low block or we go after teams.\n\n“I’m sure under Sir Alex [Ferguson] you went after some teams and you were happy in the mid block and happy defending low. I think Michael will bring that.I think there’ll be times going man-for-man all over the pitch and be really aggressive.\n\n“There’ll also be times we’ll be happy and content keeping the spaces short and punishing teams on the counter-attack. I think it’s important to be tactically flexible.”\n\nUnited will now look to make it five wins out of five when they travel to London to face West Ham United later on Tuesday.\n\nFeature image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "title": "I'm a stylist who regularly works with wealthy clients. There are 5 things I never see in their closets.",
    "description": "As a personal stylist, I've noticed wealthy clients rarely have things like fast fashion or overpriced designer basics in their wardrobes and closets.",
    "fullText": "As a personal stylist, my clients represent a range of incomes, ages, and phases of life.\n\nI help everyone from twentysomethings trying to appear more professional in the office to older clients needing a packing list for their next luxurious vacation.\n\nTheir budgets range and so do their closets — I've been in cluttered dumpster fires and ones so minimal they're almost sterile.\n\nOver the years, though, I've noticed a few patterns with how wealthier clients shop and curate their wardrobes. For one, there are a few things I never see in their closets.\n\nMy wealthier clients approach shopping much like investing: strategically.\n\nBecause of this, they'll usually skip fast fashion in favor of high-quality pieces made from luxe fabrics that are designed to last years, even decades.\n\nIf you have to keep replacing something, you'll end up spending more money in the long run.\n\nOftentimes, a well-made staple's higher price can amortize to pennies per wear. Meanwhile, a $10 sweater may not be such a great deal if it only survives a few washes.\n\nOne thing many of my wealthiest clients have in common is that they shop with intention. Even those who could afford to buy anything would be appalled if I suggested a \"Pretty Woman\"-style shopping spree.\n\nIn my experience, this means they're not prone to impulse buying or shopping sale racks.\n\nInstead, they think about the upcoming months and what they are actually going to need and realistically wear. A new pair of jeans for fall? A light jacket for an upcoming trip?\n\nIf an item is on sale, it's a bonus, but they're not buying something simply because it's discounted.\n\nFor them, shopping is often practical and strategic. The goal is to know what you like and find the thing you sought out to purchase.\n\nThey aren't buying outfits that fit an imaginary life they could one day have or dresses for occasions that haven't been planned yet.\n\nIt's a lesson any of us could benefit from learning: Know what you need before you go shopping and make sure you have a clear idea of when you'll wear something before taking it home.\n\nThat way, you can feel comfortable snipping the price tag off of a piece before it even enters your closet.\n\nSome designer labels sell plain T-shirts that cost hundreds of dollars, sometimes even over $1,000 a pop.\n\nHowever, I haven't found many of them in my clients' closets because they recognize that great basics don't have to be expensive and style can be had at every price point.\n\nSo, they often have a few more affordable staples mixed in with their designer pieces.\n\nIn my experience, even the wealthiest shoppers aren't above a \"mall brand.\" It's not uncommon for them to pair their four-figure leather jacket with a Gap tee or J. Crew sweater.\n\nI've noticed many of my high-end clients are open to editing their wardrobes, even if they have plenty of empty closet space.\n\nIt's rare for them to hold onto tops from college or jeans that haven't fit in a decade \"just in case.\" They don't keep a garment just because \"it's perfectly good\" or \"there's nothing wrong with it.\"\n\nInstead, pieces are in their closet because they wear them and enjoy doing so. This is a good reminder that it's OK to say goodbye to clothes that no longer fit or that haven't been worn in a long time.\n\nTrends may come back around, but just as we grow and change through different seasons and eras of life, our clothes should, too.\n\nIt's common for these clients to have a roster of people who can help keep their favorite pieces in ready-to-wear condition.\n\nThey often have a go-to tailor who can adjust the fit of clothing, a cobbler who can repair footwear, and a mender who can fix zippers.\n\nInstead of tossing worn dress shoes, they'll get them resoled. Rather than never wearing a blouse that always gapes, they'll have a snap sewn in.\n\nOnce again, these clients love a good investment. Mindful repairs can extend the life of clothing and shoes while also making them more comfortable and easier to wear.",

Chet Holmgren added a key put-back dunk with 1:17 to play for the NBA-leading Thunder, who had lost three of five.\n\nIsaiah Joe scored 19 points and Alex Caruso added 17 from Oklahoma City's bench. Holmgren had 13 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nMarcus Smart scored 19 points and Austin Reaves had 16 on a minutes restriction for Los Angeles, which dropped to a pedestrian 14-9 at home.\n\nJared McCain scored on his first two possessions and finished with seven points in his second game for the Thunder, who acquired the guard from Philadelphia by trade last week.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander's abdominal injury will keep him out through the All-Star Game this weekend in Inglewood, California. The Lakers haven't determined how long they'll be without Doncic, who missed his second straight game with a mild hamstring strain.\n\nThunder: At Phoenix on Wednesday.\n\nLakers: Host San Antonio on Wednesday.",

The scene then shifts inside the aircraft, where a voice announces that the plane is “flying over the Gulf of America.” A screeching eagle sound effect follows as the video rapidly transitions to the White House, cutting through a montage of President Donald Trump signing executive orders. “We bet on ourselves and don’t apologize for winning,” the narrator continues.",

    "fullText": "After a win on Sunday, LSU women's basketball is holding firm in the top five of the NCAA's latest NET rankings, a key factor the NCAA selection committee looks at when seeding teams in March.\n\nLSU is sitting just behind two SEC rivals, with South Carolina ranking No. 3 and Texas sitting at No. 4. LSU is 22-3 on the year and 4-3 in games vs. quad one opponents, meaning all of their losses have been to Q1 teams. LSU is 3-0 vs. quad two opponents and 3-0 vs. quad three opponents.\n\nLSU beat Auburn 77-44 on Sunday, bouncing back after the Tigers fell at Texas last week. Freshman ZaKiyah Johnson led the way for LSU with 16 points. MiKaylah Williams also scored in double-digits.\n\nLSU's net ranking indicates the Tigers are still in play for a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. March is approaching, but the Tigers still have several chances to build their resume while already having a few signature wins under their belt.\n\nLSU's next game is a big one as the Tigers will host South Carolina in Baton Rouge on Saturday. LSU has all week to prepare as they search for an elusive victory over Dawn Staley's Gamecocks.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: Where LSU women's basketball stands in updated NET rankings",

    "description": "You don't usually expect restaurant-style service at 35,000 feet — but Turkish still staffs a 'flying chef' in business class on its longest routes.",
    "fullText": "You don't usually expect restaurant-style service at 35,000 feet — but Turkish Airlines still staffs a 'flying chef' in business class on its longest routes.\n\nThese rare culinary specialists, who are separate from flight attendants, take food orders, plate meals in the galley, and oversee premium service on long-haul flights.\n\nThe role is designed to make dining feel closer to a restaurant than standard airline catering — but chefs don't actually cook from scratch due to flight safety rules. They use ovens to heat and finish pre-prepared meals and then arrange the presentation.\n\nThese chefs also take customer feedback from the air to help improve and develop meals in catering kitchens on the ground.\n\nI recently experienced the unique service on a 10-hour flight from Istanbul to New York in January. Considering Turkish won Skytrax's 2025 awards for Europe's best business class and best business class catering, I was eager to see how the seat and food measured up.\n\nI strategically chose the Boeing 787 for its modern business cabin; the Boeing 777 that also flies the route doesn't have the nicer design.\n\nBetween the lie-flat seat, the large TV, and the restaurant-style meals, the cabin felt like my living room on a lazy Saturday night.\n\nI slept well and appreciated the wide variety of food, from poached eggs and swordfish to a trolley full of savory appetizers.\n\nHere's what the full experience was like. Business Insider paid a media rate for the business class upgrade to New York.\n\nTurkish's Istanbul business class lounge is unreal, with cooked-to-order meals like omelettes and kebabs, drink stations, and sleep suites that feel like mini hotel rooms.\n\nMy layover time qualified me for a suite, but they're first-come, first-served — I was lucky to wait only about 15 minutes.\n\nThe bed was so comfortable I slept five hours straight, with a shared bathroom and shower just across the hall.\n\nI chose seat 8A, in the last row, for privacy and to be among the first to deplane. Although it's right by the galley and lavatory nearest the boarding door, I didn't notice much noise with headphones on.\n\nMost Turkish business cabins don't have doors. Some A350s do, and the airline is planning a new \"Crystal Business Class\" with sliding doors, but most planes — including the 787 I flew on — still don't.\n\nIt's not a dealbreaker by any means, and the seat wings help cocoon the space a bit, but there is less overall privacy than with a door.\n\nThe business class seats lie fully flat, and mine felt both spacious and cozy. I could comfortably sleep on my stomach, and I particularly liked the mattress pad and the dual-texture blanket, which has a soft plush on one side.\n\nI also appreciated the 1-2-1 cabin that let me freely reach the aisle. Many of Turkish's old planes still have 2-3-2 layouts that force middle and window-seat travelers to crawl over their neighbor to reach the restroom.\n\nThe seat had multiple storage spots: a cabinet, a footrest cubby, and a slim seatback pocket — plus an overhead bin to myself.\n\nI stashed my purse, Kindle, chargers, boots, backpack, and jacket without feeling cramped.\n\nThe seat's television was large and fully controllable via a handheld remote. I watched \"The Big Bang Theory,\" \"Fast and Furious,\" and an Agatha Christie-style whodunit called \"Murder at the Embassy.\"\n\nInstead of a flight attendant, a dedicated flying chef takes orders, plates meals, and preps appetizer and dessert carts.\n\nMost of the menu — like meats and soups — are fully or nearly fully cooked on the ground in airline kitchens, but finished in the air by the chef and cabin crew using onboard ovens.\n\nThe cabin crew still hands out drinks and hot towels, but with meals covered, I imagine they can better focus on other tasks.\n\nAll of the food was served on real dishware and with flatware — no cheap plastic.\n\nTurkish offers a \"dining-on-demand\" strategy that lets passengers choose when they want to eat.\n\nFor example, I slept a few hours after breakfast before requesting tea, though the crew member also brought me a small sandwich. It was simple — handcrafted with a roll, lettuce, and cheese — but perfect while I watched a movie.\n\nThere were also free snacks available throughout the flight, like popcorn, fruit, mixed nuts, chocolate, cookies, and chips.\n\nThe breakfast started with appetizers: fresh juice, fruit salad, cheeses, smoked turkey, marinated olives, and bread with butter and jam.\n\nThe entrée options included poached eggs with a savory sauce called shakshuka, spinach-and-cheese stuffed pastries and flatbreads (börek and gözleme), and sweet curd crepes with fruit and berry sauce.\n\nI had the poached eggs, which were prepared on the ground but were still fluffy with a perfectly runny yolk on the plane.\n\nThe second meal included a huge range of appetizers: octopus salad, salmon tartare, shrimp salad, artichoke salad, fried aubergine, beef patties, chicken salad, cheese, red pepper soup, creamy pea soup, and Köpoğlu (essentially Turkish eggplant caviar).\n\nEverything was arranged on a trolley by the chef and rolled down the galley for passengers to pick and choose; the presentation made the experience feel more fancy, and everything was tasty.\n\nBesides Turkish, select Saudia, Austrian Airlines, and Garuda Indonesia flights feature onboard chefs.\n\nTurkish's chefs, staffed through catering partner DO&CO, also spend time at meal-prep facilities, providing feedback and helping maintain quality — a hands-on approach that shows in the in-flight service.\n\nI rarely check luggage, but I had too many souvenirs this time.\n\nLuckily, my bag survived the transfer from Zagreb, Croatia, and arrived in New York safe and sound.",

    "description": "From bold red carpets to headline-making performances, take a look at Bad Bunny's best and worst fashion moments over the years.",
    "fullText": "Bad Bunny is headlining the Super Bowl Halftime Show on Sunday, and fans are eager to see how his outfit might play a role in the production.\n\nSince his 2016 debut, Bad Bunny has established himself as a fearless fashion icon, often talking about how central his style is to who he is in songs like \"Yo Visto Así,\" where he sings, \"I wear what I want, I won't change / If you don't like it, you don't have to look.\"\n\nWhile the singer's unapologetic fashion style has been one of the many things that's helped him become a worldwide superstar, his fashion evolution tells a story of experimentation … and the unavoidable mistakes that come with it.\n\nAs we prepare to see the singer take the stage at the Super Bowl this Sunday, take a look back at some of his most iconic looks through the years, starting with his best.\n\nHis third Met Gala appearance — and first serving as a co-chair for the event — was among the best and most acclaimed.\n\nThe singer wore a custom Maison Margiela Artisanal suit designed by John Galliano that stood out for its theatrical flair.\n\nIt included a navy suit with white stitching detail, a dark floral fabric bouquet, and a surreal sculptural hat that reflected the fashion house's avant-garde style. The outfit also included leather gloves, geometric sunglasses, and a horse-like pair of Margiela's signature Tabi shoes.\n\nThe look was commended as one of the night's best and cemented the singer's growing presence as a menswear icon.\n\nDuring his headlining set at Coachella in 2023, the singer wore a maximalist custom ERL patchwork puffer jacket and matching pants. The outfit was full of overly saturated, busy patterns that included florals, stripes, and plaid.\n\nThe eccentric and colorful look matched the show's stadium-level production and high-energy setlist as he performed songs from his 2022 summer album, \"Un Verano Sin Ti.\"\n\nAt the 2023 Met Gala, Bad Bunny wore a custom all-white Jacquemus suit with a cutout back and a dangling \"J\" as a nod to the look's designer. It also featured a dramatic, 26-foot-long rosette cape.\n\nThe outfit was spot-on for the event, which honored the late Karl Lagerfeld, and broke away from traditional menswear choices, becoming one of the most talked-about looks of the night.\n\nFor his debut at the Grammy Awards, Bad Bunny went for an outfit that was playful without feeling gimmicky.\n\nThe singer wore an all-black Burberry look, which he paired with a hat resembling bunny ears and tinted sunglasses.\n\nIn contrast to the simple, monochromatic outfit, he carried a bright sunflower, which added to the look's playfulness and served as a nod to the more colorful, adventurous fashion choices he'd become known for.\n\nAlthough simple, the sunflower detail was one of the most talked-about accessories of the night. \"Bad Bunny's fully bloomed sunflower has managed to make my heart swell,\" wrote Vogue's Liana Satenstein.\n\nIf we go back in Bad Bunny style history, there are certain moments that stand out … and not in a good way. His floral Gucci suit at the 2017 Latin American Music Awards is one of them.\n\nThe then-up-and-coming artist wore a loud floral suit, paired with bedazzled, tinted sunglasses and excessive diamond jewelry, including grills and layered necklaces. The suit also had embroidered details on the lapel, which were accentuated by flower details, and diamond buttons.\n\nWhile the singer — who had a buzzcut back then — might look almost unrecognizable in this look, it signaled his strong sense of style right at the beginning of his career.\n\nBut does that make it a good look? Well …\n\nAnother early look from the Puerto Rican singer shared some of the same qualities: It was a bright, unique look.\n\nBad Bunny wore a shiny purple suit with metallic fabrics, embroidered details, and gems along the lapel edges. He wore it with an equally shiny metallic shirt underneath, a large diamond cross necklace, and lilac sunglasses.\n\nWhile it was certainly a daring look, there was just too much going on, unlike the more pared-down, chic looks he would later wear.\n\nWhile Bad Bunny's performance with Marc Anthony and Will Smith at the 19th annual Latin Grammy Awards brought energy to the night, fashion-wise, it was a bit confusing.\n\nWhile Anthony stuck with his classic black-and-white suit, Smith opted for a sparkly black jacket and shirt for the stage. Bad Bunny, on the other hand, chose an outfit that was more of a reflection of the times' quickly fading trends, worn all at once.\n\nHe wore silver pleather pants, a zebra-print shirt, and a burgundy velvet bomber jacket, along with pink sunglasses, for the performance.\n\nOnstage, the look felt out of place with his collaborators' style choices. It also probably started looking dated about 15 minutes after the performance ended.\n\nThe singer wore a loud Louis Vuitton matching outfit at his 2019 Coachella performance, pairing the oversized ensemble with visor-style lenses that covered most of his face.\n\nThe outfit was covered in pastel rainbow logos, leaving little room for mistaking the look for another designer's.\n\nTo accept the award for best urban music album at the Latin Grammys for his debut album \"X 100Pre,\" Bad Bunny wore a look that combined multiple patterns and color palettes.\n\nThe singer wore a mismatching short-sleeve button-down shirt and plaid shorts with a zip-up turtle-neck-like collar, a black bucket hat, dark sunglasses, and Gucci knee pads.\n\nThe outfit matched the singer's 2018 album title \"Yo Hago Lo Que Me Da La Gana,\" which translates to \"I do whatever I want.\"",

The feedback reinforced Harbaugh's reputation as a strict, no-nonsense leader who \"knows football and he loves football.\"\n\nThibodeaux expressed enthusiasm for the straightforward approach.\n\n\"I always like when you pass a certain age, you don’t have to sugarcoat what you say, you’re just kinda straightforward, white and black,\" Thibodeaux said, via the New York Post. \"You see a lot of different cultures, different people that want to sometimes change their ways for the new generation or they want to fit in or whatever the case may be.\n\n\"For me, specifically, I like old-school coaches because they just take no (expletive), black and white, you know what you’re gonna get every day. I think with a lot of young guys that we have, I think it’s gonna be good for him to really get it in order.\"\n\nThis comes after an earlier denial in January, when Thibodeaux dismissed suggestions on social media that Giants players were calling around about Harbaugh, responding to team legend Carl Banks: \"Nobody's doing this, Carl. Effort was never the problem.\"\n\nHis recent comments show he has since actively sought insights into the coach hired to turn around the franchise following seasons of inconsistency.\n\nThibodeaux, who had his fifth-year option picked up, remains optimistic about the defense under new coordinator Dennard Wilson and is relieved that position coach Charlie Bullen was retained... For now.\n\nAfter a 2025 season cut short by injury, Thibodeaux is cleared medically and eager to thrive in Harbaugh's structured environment.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Giants' Kayvon Thibodeaux loves John Harbaugh's 'old-school' coaching style",

    "fullText": "Manchester United under Michael Carrick have won four in a row, something Ruben Amorim never managed during his 18-month spell in charge of the club.\n\nApart from the results, the style of play under the caretaker head coach has impressed fans, as has the never-say-die attitude displayed by the team.\n\nAnd on Saturday, the team also ended their hoodoo against low-blocks, something the Red Devils struggled with under the Portuguese, as seen during the encounter against Everton a few months back.\n\nBruno Fernandes, who scored a brilliant goal against Spurs, was full of praise for the former United midfielder when speaking to TNT Sports.\n\nTaking a not-so-subtle dig at Amorim, the club captain explained that Carrick came with the right ideas and instead of trying to impose something entirely different, he gave the players freedom to express themselves.\n\n“I think Michael came in with the right ideas about giving the players the responsibilities also, but some freedom on the pitch to take decisions that were needed. He is very good with the words.\n\n“I think he still remembers what I told him the last time he was our manager for our last game. And I was sure Michael could be a great manager and he’s just showing it and we hope we can help him even more.\n\n“So everyone can see not just us as players, that we are good players because that is why we are at Manchester United, but also the staff is very good.”\n\nAmorim‘s determination to play with three at the back proved to be a huge detriment to the team as was his shoehorning of players into unusual positions, something Fernandes can relate to.\n\nIt also helps that Carrick knows all about managing expectations at the world’s biggest club, something Amorim clearly was clueless about.\n\nHis negative tactics, and his disastrous man-management almost ruined certain players, but the former England international has helped restore the club’s DNA.\n\n“Everyone understands the pressure of playing for this club. If you don’t understand you start to understand very quickly because this is a massive club and everyone knows the expectations around it.\n\n“I don’t think that changes but obviously Michael has won everything here. He knows what it means for these fans, what it means for this club to win, and how much is needed to win in this football club. I think that adds something special to the team.”\n\nThe 20-time English league champions cannot afford to relax. They have the chance to win five on the trot in midweek as they aim to secure Champions League qualification.\n\nFeature image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "title": "F1 regulation change comes at a good time for younger drivers - Andrea Kimi Antonelli",
    "description": "F1 will introduce widespread regulation changes this year and the style required to race the new cars is vastly different to anything the drivers have experienced before",
    "fullText": "Andrea Kimi Antonelli is confident that Formula 1’s more inexperienced drivers will benefit from the 2026 regulation overhaul due to the need to adapt.\n\nF1 promises to look totally different this year with changes to both the chassis, lighter by 32kg plus less downforce, and engine, more reliant on electric power, after four years of ground effect cars.\n\nThere has been vast talk about how drivers will therefore need to adapt their style due to active aerodynamics and energy management playing a bigger role, with some claiming that the 2026 cars go against everything they were taught in karting.\n\nBut the younger drivers, like those who have only been in F1 since last year, may benefit from this overhaul because they’re already used to constantly changing cars and don’t really have one distinct style of racing to fall back on.\n\nAntonelli is one of those, having been fast-tracked to F1 by never contesting more than one season of a junior championship before making his Mercedes grand prix debut at the age of 18.\n\n“For all the rookies that joined F1 last year, coming into this year with a new car is kind of good, because obviously we've been used to drive a different car every year,” said the Italian teen.\n\n“So we've been used to try and adapt as quickly as possible to a new car. So of course on that side, it's good that we have a new car this year, because it's a reset for everyone. Especially for us, that we've been used to every year to a new car, it's good because we've been used to that. Maybe it will help us out to understand the car a bit quicker than others.”\n\nThe Mercedes driver therefore thinks it levels the playing field as everybody has to start from scratch, as opposed to last season where he came in at perhaps a disadvantage to others.\n\n“This is a massive rule change and it kind of resets everything because everyone has to relearn the car,” he added. “So on that side, it's better because obviously last year was last year's, the last year of the old regulation and most of the drivers, they knew the car very, very well and they've been developing that car.\n\n“While this year is definitely completely new, so on the driving side, it's a big opportunity because whoever understands it the best way and earlier than the others can really make the difference.”\n\nThat isn’t to say, however, that the veterans will struggle and automatically get beaten by the youngsters, because being inexperienced still proved costly for Antonelli last season.\n\nAlthough he impressed on occasions with three podiums and a Miami sprint pole, he also suffered many unforced crashes in practice and sometimes struggled with the pressures of being a highly-rated rookie - his home race at Imola being an example.\n\n“The other drivers are not stupid and they're pretty good,” said the 19-year-old. “So I think they will figure it out very quickly as well.\n\n“Experience still counts. With how you approach the year, every weekend, the experience still helps and because, of course, I've done one year in F1 and I've learned a lot, but this year, definitely I will have a different approach at times, but I feel I still need to learn quite a bit.\n\n“So on the experience side, there will still be a bit of a difference, but on the driving side, I think we're all on the same level now as we have the new car. So I think that is going to be a big, big opportunity.”\n\nMercedes rivals push for intervention over F1 engine loophole - but how realistic is it?\n\nGeorge Russell predicts F1 team most likely to challenge the top four in 2026\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "description": "If you dress for the office, it's worth investing in a few elevated pieces. These are our style editors' favorite luxury workwear brands.",
    "fullText": "We've all heard to \"dress for the job you want.\" It's pretty sound advice, but back when I was an unpaid fashion intern, my dream luxury workwear wardrobe was out of reach.\n\nNow that I'm a little further into my career, I've collected a select few luxury pieces I can mix and match with some less-expensive basics. This way, I can build outfits that look classically refined. I'll get plenty of use from them today, and can still wear them in the future once I'm further up the corporate ladder.\n\nWhen you invest in workwear that's actually worth the splurge, you're paying for more than just a label. Luxury workwear ticks big boxes: thoughtful engineering, premium fabrics, comfortable fits, and timeless designs.\n\nOur team of style editors has done thorough research on where to shop for women's workwear clothes, and these six luxury brands proved to be worth the splurge. From powerful suiting to soft, quality basics, these will bring something special to your office wardrobe. Here's why they're worth your attention, money, and closet space.\n\nSize range: Varies by style, with most pieces ranging from XXS-XXL or 00-20\n\nM.M. LaFleur has built a cult following by blending style, comfort, and thoughtful design — all with a professional edge. Its pieces are meant to last you from 6 a.m to 9.pm. Without extra effort, and features like adjustable pant hems and smart internal clips actually make a difference in real life.\n\n\"LaFleur designed her blouses with internal clips on the shoulders to keep your bra strap from falling down all day,\" says style editor Samantha Crozier. It's a small consideration, can actually make a difference in real life. You simply won't find that kind of attention to detail if you're relying on Express or H&M for all your workwear.\n\nThe female-founded start up was born in New York and is all about elevated silhouettes that look polished but never stiff. This makes them ideal whether you're networking at an after-hours event or traveling for business. Many fabrics are machine-washable and wrinkle-resistant, which feels like a luxury in itself.\n\nAnother one of our favorite aspects of M.M. LaFleur are its modular designs. Take the Foster Pants, for example. These stretchy work pants have concealed button hems, which lets you shorten or lengthen the inseams. Be sure to also check out its travel-friendly suits, which we found easy to wear right out of a suitcase.\n\nDespite its name, Lilysilk specializes more than just silk. Its polished workwear ensembles are made from some of the highest-quality cashmere we've ever tested, which pairs beautifully with its wool trousers, linen dresses, or luxurious silk crepe pants. \"Lilysilk's natural textiles feel so good on the skin that I've kept them on long after I've signed off for the evening. The little details elevate the whole look, too — think gold-rimmed shell buttons, chiffon-lined dresses, and crisp pleats.\"\n\nIf you're planning a look for a work gala or an important client lunch, we recommend building an outfit from their matching co-ord sets. You can throw them on without much thought and they'll still look effortlessly chic.\n\nSize range: XXS-3X, 0-28\n\nWe're confident that just about anybody can find at least one thing they love from Eileen Fisher. If your workday runs the gamut and you need an outfit that can fit in anywhere, Eileen Fisher's understated, beautifully cut basics will always come in clutch. The heritage brand is known for timeless silhouettes and top-tier fabrics that age gracefully.\n\nThere's a reason stylists keep recommending Eileen Fisher for capsule wardrobes: the clothes are comfortable, well made, size inclusive, and easy to mix and match. Think soft wool knits, breezy trousers, and classic blazers that you can style with what you already have in your closet.\n\n\"It's notable when three generations of women in my family each own one piece from the same clothing brand,\" writes senior associate style editor Gabrielle Chase. \"We all have our own ideas on how to style them, but we all agree Eileen Fisher is the queen of quality textiles.\"\n\nSize range: XS-XL, 0-14 \n\nNot only does Cuyana makes some of our favorite luxury work bags for women, but its \"Fewer, Better\" philosophy aligns exactly with how our editors feel about shopping selectively. \n\nIt's easy to feel overwhelmed scrolling through pages upon pages of clothing items, so Cuyana keeps it simple with a condensed collection of modern, neutral-colored basics. Each one is expensive to be sure, but that's largely due to the certifiably sustainable materials and Cuyana's high standards for ethical production.\n\nFrom its soft, single-origin sweaters to supportive base layers, these shape-shifting workhorses are essential to the modern feminine wardrobe. And if the current collection doesn't pique your fancy, we recommend checking out its Archive Sale for a retrospect into the brand's design evolution.\n\nSize range: Dependent on designer\n\nTuckernuck brings a playful, preppy energy to workwear — think pastel button-downs, tweed Jackie O dresses, and structured shoulders that standout in a conference room. Its curation of designer labels all revolve an East Coast-inspired aesthetic, from household names like Isabel Marant and Polo Ralph Lauren to independent fashion houses like Erdem or Ulla Johnson.\n\nWhile not a traditional workwear brand in the suit-and-blazer sense, Tuckernuck's Workwear Edit proves that its buyers are familiar with the scope of the professional woman's wardrobe, from everyday essentials to floral prints and fun shapes that are sure to earn you some compliments.\n\nIt took some digging around the site, but through Tuckernuck we've discovered some of our favorite work pants for women and work dresses that transition from desk to dinner. If you're shopping its in-house label, check the material composition to be sure you're paying for more than a trendy tag.\n\nSize range: Distinct microsizes in the 00-40 range\n\nLaws of Motion's claim to fame is providing precise fits in a way that doesn't require going to the tailor. It instead uses proprietary data science and AI-driven sizing to pinpoint hundreds of \"microsizes,\" so your work clothes feel nearly custom-made.\n\nTraditional sizing only fits a tiny fraction of bodies well. Laws of Motion remedies that with precision sizing that accounts for shape as much as size, making its workwear staples feel truly tailored. You can find your custom fit with just a 60-second quiz, or do a simple body scan right from your phone.\n\n\"The styles feel modern and powerful — I always feel ready to take on the world in Laws of Motion,\" says freelance writer fashion expert in her guide to the best plus-size workwear. \"I also really appreciate the thoughtful details they incorporate in their designs, like the longer ribbon on the Legend's zipper pull, making it easier to zip up yourself — even if you have short arms like me!\"\n\nIf you're totally new to the brand and skeptical of its unconventional size system, we suggest starting with a blazer. From chic longline versions to cheeky cropped tweed numbers, it has blazers that'll fit full busts, wide shoulders, long torsos, and everyone in between.\n\nEven with relaxed office dress codes, these brands make pieces that can maintain their shape, look sharper on video calls, and last you for years. By spending more on fewer pieces, you're rewarded with higher quality materials, durable construction, and intuitive design details that help you get dressed in a way that looks effortlessly chic.\n\nNot everyone can afford a full closet of luxury workwear, but you can collect enough pieces that'll give the illusion of a C-suite level wardrobe. One strategy is to splurge on foundational items you'll wear frequently (like a tailored blazer or versatile pant) and pair them with more affordable basics. Another is to browse luxury archive sales to get premium pieces at a lower price point without sacrificing quality.\n\nLuxury brands typically offer superior fabrics, unique design features (like adjustable hems or precision fit), and finishes that stand up to repeated wear. You're also going to pay more for brands like Eileen Fisher and Cuyana, which are more transparent about their workers' wages and the lengths they go to source eco-friendly materials. The more ethical the supply chain, the higher the cost.\n\nYou don't necessarily have to reserve these pieces for Monday through Friday. A blazer can be styled more casual with joggers and ankle boots, and even a knit dress can turn cozy with the right accessories. As style editors who prioritize value, we think in terms of \"cost-per-wear,\" meaning the more times you wear a piece, the better the investment. Focus on solid, neutral colors in order to get the most of your luxury workwear.\n\nYes, though it depends on the brand. Before you splurge, know your measurements to a tee so you can compare them to size charts. Some luxury brands are more size-inclusive than others, like Eileen Fisher and Laws of Motion.

    "description": "Melania Trump used to walk red carpets in sparkly, sheer outfits. As first lady, she embraces suits, high-fashion designers, and bold accessories.",
    "fullText": "At a \"Celebrity\" party in 1998, Melania chose a figure-hugging silk dress in periwinkle. Its neckline scooped gently.\n\nMelania arrived at the 1999 Annual Fragrance Foundation Fifi Awards in a form-fitting dress covered entirely in pink sparkles.\n\nThe gown's subtle slit was sexy without being over the top.\n\nShe attended the New York premiere of \"Charlie's Angels\" in a white skirt suit, but added a daring edge to the look with a sheer lace top.\n\nStrappy heels completed her outfit.\n\nWhen she accompanied Donald Trump to the Oscars, Melania wore a form-fitting white dress embellished with sparkly sequins.\n\nThe gown had a V-neckline, which mirrored the slit running up the center of the dress.\n\nBefore her life had political ties, Melania was often spotted in casual looks, like this all-orange ensemble she wore to a Fashion Week show.\n\nShe paired the silk off-the-shoulder top with wide-legged pants that featured a striped pattern and sparkles.\n\nA full skirt accented the gown's form-fitting bodice.\n\nThe black-and-tan dress had a feathered skirt with sheer detailing, and she paired it with coordinating shoes.\n\nTrump proposed to Melania on April 26, 2004, the evening of the Met Gala.\n\nShe paired her 15-carat engagement ring with a black ball gown, which had a corset covered in cutouts.\n\nAttending a Fashion Week event, Melania paired fitted jeans with a sheer pink babydoll top. High heels completed the look.\n\nMelania attended the Night of Stars party in October 2005 when she was expecting Barron Trump.\n\nShe wore an empire-waist black gown to the event, which featured sheer fabric on the neckline and sparkly embellishments.\n\nBlack dresses with sheer detailing became a bit of a uniform for Melania in the early 2000s, as she showed with her dress for the Metropolitan Opera Opening Night Dinner in 2006.\n\nThe silk dress had lace detailing on the sheer bodice and the neckline. Crisscross straps and lace paneling on the skirt added to the sexy gown.\n\nAt the 2007 Met Gala, Melania wore a shiny gold minidress with fabric tassels that swayed as she walked. She paired the look with coordinating gold shoes.\n\nMelania was photographed attending a Fashion Week event in 2007 alongside Donald Trump.\n\nShe wore all-black, and her hat and wrap featured fuzzy detailing. Knee-high boots completed the wintry ensemble.\n\nMelania kept up her streak of eye-catching Met Gala looks in 2008, arriving in a bright-pink, strapless Vera Wang dress.\n\nThe dress had a bow on the neckline and ruffle detailing on its mermaid skirt.\n\nAt the premiere of \"Nine,\" Melania wore a short, long-sleeved dress embroidered with sparkles, which she paired with pointed-toe shoes.\n\nMelania's black cocktail dress had a form-fitting bodice with a subtle sweetheart neckline and spaghetti straps. The dress hit her knees, and she paired it with open-toe shoes.\n\nMelania's black suit was simple, featuring flared pants and a fitted jacket. The top buttons of her white blouse were open, and the sleeves poked out from under the jacket.\n\nBlack, pointed heels complemented the ensemble.\n\nMelania's gray dress for her \"Good Afternoon America\" appearance had a professional feel.\n\nThe fitted dress had a V-neckline and covered her knees, and a black belt cinched her waist. She also wore black heels.\n\nWhen Trump hosted an Invitational Grand Prix at Mar-a-Lago in January 2013, Melania showed that she could nail a dress code.\n\nHer white, sleeveless dress had a scooped neckline and a pleated skirt that felt like an elevated version of a golf ensemble. She added white heels to the look.\n\nThe jumpsuit featured long sleeves, subtly flared pants, and semi-sheer paneling on the bodice adorned with black lace.\n\nBlack heels accented the ensemble.\n\nAfter Trump announced he was running for president in the summer of 2015, he and Melania appeared on \"Barbara Walters Presents: The 10 Most Fascinating People of 2015.\"\n\nMelania chose a simple pink dress with short sleeves and a modest neckline for the interview. Her pink, pointed shoes matched the dress.\n\nLauren A. Rothman, a style strategist and image coach, told Business Insider that Melania seemed to be telling \"two narratives\" with fashion throughout her life, leaning into glamour and slightly more daring looks when she was first in the public eye.\n\nBut after Trump entered politics, Rothman said Melania's looks became more intentional because \"she was trying to say something with more storytelling\" about her identity and her husband through her fashion, as she showed at the 2016 RNC.\n\nFor the RNC, Melania wore the \"Margot\" dress from Roksanda, which she bought from Net-a-Porter, according to Vanity Fair. The modest white dress had a high neckline, a knee-length hem, and quarter-length sleeves that ended in ruffles.\n\nThe dress was simple and elegant, striking a similar tone to first ladies of years past.\n\nMelania attended her husband's inauguration in a powder-blue dress designed by Ralph Lauren Collection. The dress was paired with a matching shrug and gloves.\n\nThe silhouette was reminiscent of Jackie Kennedy's outfits during her time as first lady.\n\n\"It was so curated,\" Rothman said of the look. \"It was an instant revival of that Jackie memory.\"\n\nRothman said the nostalgia in the look lent Melania some of the power Jackie Kennedy held in the American mind, striking the right tone for the beginning of her tenure as first lady.\n\nRalph Lauren is also a classic American designer, though Melania would go on to wear European designers throughout Trump's presidency.\n\nMelania changed into a gown custom-designed by Hervé Pierre Braillard for his Hervé Pierre line.\n\nThe form-fitting, cream dress had off-the-shoulder sleeves made of the same fabric as a three-dimensional swath that cut across the bodice, creating volume. The same fabric flowed on the skirt, creating a train on one side, and a red belt cinched her waist.\n\nBraillard became Melania's stylist and strategy consultant throughout Trump's first term.\n\nIn 2018, Melania visited the Texas-Mexico border to speak to child migrants wearing a green jacket that said \"I really don't care, do u?\" on the back.\n\nThe Zara jacket instantly became controversial, leading people to speculate that the first lady was sending a message to the president or migrants at the border.\n\nIn her book \"I'll Take Your Questions Now,\" Stephanie Grisham, Melania's former aide, wrote that Trump yelled at Melania for wearing the jacket, though he later told media outlets she wore it to send a message to \"fake news\" outlets. Melania later repeated Trump's comments on the jacket, CNN reported.\n\nMelania accompanied Trump to the debate in a pinstripe Dolce & Gabbana suit.\n\nShe wore the jacket open over a white blouse with no tie and completed her look with Christian Louboutin heels.\n\nWhen the Trumps left the White House on January 20, 2021, Melania wore an all-black outfit comprising a Chanel jacket with gold button detailing, a Dolce & Gabbana dress, and Christian Louboutin heels. Black gloves and sunglasses completed the somber but chic ensemble.\n\nBut when they arrived at Mar-a-Lago later that day, Melania exited Air Force One in a $3,700 Gucci dress, though she wore the same sunglasses she had on earlier that day. Her loose gown featured quarter-length sleeves and an orange-and-navy print.\n\n\"Like anyone, sometimes we take off our work clothes, and we put on our play clothes,\" Rothman said. \"She went from wearing something super fitted to something loose that is right out of Palm Beach.\"\n\nMelania kept her public appearances more limited after Trump left office, but she appeared alongside him at a New Year's Eve party at Mar-a-Lago in December 2022.\n\nFor the occasion, she wore another Dolce & Gabbana dress. The knee-length, silver gown had long sleeves. It was covered in sparkles, as were her pointed-toe shoes.\n\nMelania paired a black long-sleeved top with a high-waisted, midi-length brown skirt from Martin Grant, which was belted with a bow at her waist. Her Chanel ballet flats featured both colors.\n\nA black Chanel bag completed her look.\n\nMelania stepped out at Mar-a-Lago in a black Versace dress for the last day of 2024.\n\nThe gown had an asymmetrical neckline that scooped low, hugged Melania's figure, then formed a slit on one leg.\n\nIt was glamorous and more reminiscent of her looks before Trump entered politics.\n\nMelania arrived at the 2025 inauguration in a custom navy coat designed by Adam Lippes.\n\nThe double-breasted jacket was elegant, and Melania paired it with navy pumps and a white scarf. However, the standout element of her look was her Eric Javits hat, which was also navy and white.\n\n\"It's a huge fashion moment,\" Rothman said of Melania's hat. She said the summery shape of the hat nodded to Melania's day-to-day life at Mar-a-Lago, while the wool texture and dark colors spoke to the role she was stepping back into.\n\n\"She wore a hat that bridges her worlds together,\" she added.\n\nMelania again turned to Hervé Pierre for her evening look at Donald Trump's inaugural balls, donning a strapless white dress. Black fabric crisscrossed the bodice and skirt, creating a slit on one side.\n\nA black choker made of the same fabric tied the look together.\n\nThe first lady wore a slew of menswear looks in early 2025, including a Ralph Lauren suit she wore to support the Take It Down Act at the US Capitol in March 2025.\n\nThe camel-toned, three-piece suit included a jacket, fitted trousers, and a vest. She paired it with a white blouse, black tie, and coordinating pumps, giving the look a distinctly formal feel.\n\nIn September 2025, Melania joined her husband on a state visit to the UK, spending time with King Charles III and Queen Camilla, as well as Prince William and Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales.\n\nFor a white-tie dinner at Windsor Castle, Melania wore a bright-yellow gown designed by Carolina Herrera. The off-the-shoulder dress had long sleeves and a floor-length skirt, and it cinched at Melania's waist with a wide purple belt.\n\nThe gown's bright color was a bold choice for the royal dinner and a marked change from the neutral looks Melania had been wearing for much of 2025.\n\nThe Trumps hosted Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, for dinner at the White House in November 2025.\n\nThe first lady wore a strapless, green gown for the dinner. Designed by Elie Saab, the $3,350 dress featured ruching on the bodice and skirt, with a slit running up the center.\n\nThe dress was pretty, but it also radiated a warm welcome for Salman, as the deep-green fabric resembled the colors of the Saudi flag. Likewise, Elie Saab held a historic fashion show in Saudi Arabia in 2024, so the choice of designer seemed to nod to Salman's country as well.\n\nWhen the 2025 Christmas tree arrived at the White House, Melania donned a knee-length white coat. The high-neck, wide-sleeved coat was typical for the first lady, but her accessories were more colorful than she might have worn in years past.\n\nShe wore red leather gloves from Max Mara, which brought drama to the look, as well as tartan pumps from Manolo Blahnik. The look was festive but still felt authentic to Melania's style.\n\nAt the start of 2026, the first lady returned to her more neutral-toned wardrobe in a Dolce & Gabbana look while promoting \"Melania.\"\n\nHer high-neck suit jacket was buttoned down the center and belted at the waist. Her midi-length skirt was column-style, and she paired the set with black pumps.\n\nThe outfit struck a professional, restrained tone, particularly compared to the colorful looks she wore in the second half of 2025.",

    "description": "Eddie Bauer, one of the oldest brands in American outdoor apparel,  is facing potential closures of most of its stores as bankruptcy looms.",
    "fullText": "For more than a century, Eddie Bauer has been synonymous with American outdoor adventure apparel. Now the iconic brand is facing the possible collapse of most of its brick-and-mortar business as a bankruptcy filing looms.\n\nThe retailer's roughly 180 stores across the United States and Canada could soon be shuttered amid plans for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing tied to the brand's North American store operations.\n\nEddie Bauer, one of the oldest brands in American outdoor apparel, has a storied history. It's also faced bankruptcy twice before.\n\nThe brand was founded in Seattle in 1920 by outdoorsman Eddie Bauer, who two decades later patented the first quilted goose-down jacket in the country.\n\nAt its height, Eddie Bauer had more than 500 stores worldwide, including hundreds across North America and additional locations in Japan and Germany.\n\nToday, Eddie Bauer's retail footprint has shrunk to roughly 200 stores — most of which could soon be on the chopping block as the entity operating the retailer's stores in the US and Canada prepares a bankruptcy filing, sources familiar with the situation have told Business Insider.\n\nAny potential bankruptcy filing would not affect Eddie Bauer's manufacturing, wholesale, or e-commerce operations, nor its retail business outside the US and Canada. Japan is home to several Eddie Bauer stores.\n\nHere's a look back at the Eddie Bauer brand through the years:\n\nThe late Bauer patented the iconic water-resistant, bomber-style \"Skyliner\" jacket in 1940. He was inspired to create the coat after a near-fatal experience with hypothermia during a winter fishing trip in Washington state.\n\n''I was climbing a very steep hill when I started to get sleepy,'' Bauer said in a 1981 interview with The New York Times while describing the encounter. ''I reached to touch my back and it was ice. I realized I was freezing to death.''\n\nOver the years, the Eddie Bauer brand cemented its place in the outdoor apparel industry through durable, innovative gear and clothing designed to withstand extreme conditions.\n\nEddie Bauer gear has long been used by adventurers.\n\nIn 1953, Bauer created his first mountaineering parka for the American team attempting the first ascent of K2 mountain in Pakistan.\n\nIn the decades that followed, the Eddie Bauer brand continued outfitting elite climbing teams with parkas and other cold-weather gear, including the first American team to reach the summit of Mount Everest in 1963.\n\nGeneral Mills Inc. is a big part of Eddie Bauer's history.\n\nThe cereal maker and food conglomerate owned the outdoor apparel brand from 1971 to 1988.\n\nGeneral Mills built up Eddie Bauer into a prominent retail brand, expanding it to about 60 stores before selling it to Spiegel Inc. for $260 million.\n\nEddie Bauer and Ford Motor Company partnered in the early 1980s to launch special edition Eddie Bauer vehicles. That collaboration lasted for nearly three decades.\n\nUnder the partnership, models like the Ford Explorer, Expedition, and F-150 featured Eddie Bauer trim branding and upgrades, including leather interiors and two-tone exteriors.\n\nThe Eddie Bauer Ford Explorer was particularly popular.\n\n\"Customers come in and ask to see the Eddie Bauer version, and it's almost sold on sight,\" a general manager of an Ohio car dealership told The Plain Dealer newspaper in 1991.\n\nIn 2000, Eddie Bauer partnered with the environmental organization Riverkeeper on the Eddie Bauer-Riverkeeper Kayak Challenge held on the Hudson River near Manhattan's Chelsea Piers.\n\nActor brothers Alec Baldwin and Billy Baldwin were among the participants at the event. Photos from the challenge show that the Baldwin brothers got soaked.\n\nEddie Bauer has previously been through two Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructurings.\n\nThe first time was in 2003 when its then-parent company, Spiegel, filed for bankruptcy. Eddie Bauer emerged from that bankruptcy two years later as a stand-alone company.\n\nFacing mounting debt, the retailer filed for Chapter 11 in 2009 and was acquired by private equity firm Golden Gate Capital later that year through a bankruptcy auction.\n\nThe brand was later acquired by Authentic Brands Group, in partnership with SPARC Group (which has since become Catalyst Brands), in 2021.",

    "description": "The Sixers turned in another third-quarter meltdown to waste a good Joel Embiid performance, falling 119-115 to the Los Angeles Lakers in infuriating fashion. Here’s what I saw. Third quarter...",
    "fullText": "The Sixers turned in another third-quarter meltdown to waste a good Joel Embiid performance, falling 119-115 to the Los Angeles Lakers in infuriating fashion.\n\nJoel Embiid had just an okay game against the Clippers in Philadelphia’s barnstorming win on Monday, sitting out the second half of a back-to-back against Golden State the next night. It felt a little bit like he owed these guys something, if for no other reason than having the freshest pair of legs. And boy, did he deliver on that, sparking the Sixers early while playing a do-it-all hub on offense for a team that struggled to make shots for most of the night.\n\nWith the Lakers down Jaxson Hayes thanks to his mascot-related suspension — yes, he really is that big of a clown — DeAndre Ayton was the only guy close to like-sized that L.A. could throw at him. But it didn’t especially matter, outside of a few offensive rebounds Ayton pulled down at his expense. Ayton’s on-again, off-again effort is a bad matchup for an opponent who will take any bit of space and rise into a midrange jumper, and Embiid was able to get the shot going within the first five minutes of the game. When that happens, opponents are in jail trying to guard him, as it opens up opportunities to punish reach-ins and drive by jumpy defenders.\n\nOutside of Ayton, the Lakers mixed up coverages and the defender primarily tasked with guarding Embiid. From Jarred Vanderbilt to Maxi Kleber and others across the spectrum, the main theme was a big size advantage for Embiid. On some nights, that might mean deep post catches and a free-throw parade, but with Embiid often operating from the middle of a zone, it meant a lot of jumpers his man could never get close enough to contest. One little jab step, one little body language cue, and the Lakers were falling all over themselves to stay with him, with Embiid rising into lightly-contested shots for the entire first half. 20 easy points at halftime, thank you very much.\n\nEmbiid had some sloppiness with the handle early, but he was killing the Lakers as a playmaker for others, too, punctuating his first half with an outstanding play: Embiid faked a handoff attempt to Tyrese Maxey, drove downhill into the space the Lakers left vacated, and as the defense collapsed on him in the paint, he released the ball to Dominick Barlow for an easy bucket, sending the Sixers into halftime on a high note.\n\nEverything was rolling along until, you guessed it, the third quarter hit. I cannot believe we are this far into the season and still treating the quarter after halftime as an unsolvable Sphinx riddle for the Sixers to solve. Change the opponent, the venue, the players on the floor, nothing really matters. They will find a way to stink it up all the same.\n\nThere was a decided lack of seriousness from the Sixers after they surged to a double-digit lead early in the third, allowing the Lakers to get back into the game with seven turnovers in a single quarter. They were mostly in cruise control until about the halfway point of the third, and then the wheels came off. Nurse resisted turning to his bench as the Sixers held onto a small but mildly comfortable lead, and it all came crashing down in the end-of-quarter stretch, with Maxey battling foul trouble and Embiid resting on the bench.\n\nEnter Quentin Grimes, a mystifying player to watch. His first half was filled with genuinely awesome moments, with Grimes best understanding what needs to be done when Austin Reaves is on the floor. Drawing him in isolation repeatedly, Grimes went right by him to the rim on several different occasions, making Reaves work as he tore up the Sixers on the other end. He also put down his second highlight dunk of the week with a hellacious throwdown over Jake LaRavia, who I presume had a family.\n\nTELL THEM DON’T JUMP, Q!!! 💥🤯pic.twitter.com/K78SL0bJGp\n\n— PHLY Sixers (@PHLY_Sixers) February 6, 2026\n\nThe second half was what we will charitably refer to as an adventure. When Grimes checked into the game for his end-of-third minutes, the game almost immediately flipped in the wrong direction. He had a brutal turnover, a bad foul, and a miscommunication with VJ Edgecombe in quick succession, and the Lakers were surging. His first good play of that stretch, a steal near halfcourt, was nearly botched before order was restored, only for Kelly Oubre to launch a tightly-contested three with close to 20 seconds left on the shot clock. Not the time or the place, particularly when you’re 2/7 at the time, Mr. Oubre.\n\nThis was the first stretch of basketball over the last week where I felt they desperately needed Paul George. In those backup lineups where they try to buy rest for Embiid and Maxey, it tends to be George who emerges as a cooler head, attacking in isolation or offering spacing for VJ Edgecombe to attack in. With George in street clothes, we were back to early-season Sixers hoops, with the Edgecombe/Grimes/Watford/Oubre combo dying for some spacing, plus decision-making, and savvy.\n\nDown two points with 27 seconds left, the Sixers apparently decided they would trap late and concede a basket instead of either defending the play straight up or fouling to play the back-and-forth game. On the ensuing possession with 12 seconds left, Maxey took a ridiculous foul-baiting three and lost them the opportunity for even a chance to tie or win the game.\n\nOne of the dumbest sequences in Sixers history, straight up.\n\nVJ Edgecombe is what I would affectionately refer to as an all-action player, someone who rarely rests on his laurels who helps you win games no matter what the moment requires. Those guys can occasionally cross the line and go careening into the opponent, trying too hard to impact the game while it boomerangs back on them. But he is a rare breed of rookie, constantly playing with 100 percent effort while minimizing his wild moments on both ends of the floor.\n\nIn fact, Edgecombe often cleans up craziness from other players. Joel Embiid had the rare opportunity to throw him a lob on the break, tossing the ensuing pass so high that two VJ Edgecombes stacked on top of one another in a trenchcoat probably wouldn’t have reached the ball. But after making the attempt to meet it at the summit, Edgecombe collected himself quickly and saved it from going out of bounds, ultimately earning the Sixers an extra possession that ended with an Embiid midrange make. These plays are a constant in the Edgecombe experience.\n\nThe Lakers tried to dare the Sixers into beating them with the three-ball with a fair amount of zone, and Edgecombe was the only guy making outside shots to potentially get them out of it. He is slowly starting to figure out the happy medium on the break, darting through traffic for layups and dunks or slowing down to find an open shooter if those easy opportunities aren’t there. Edgecombe was one of their few solid options defending Austin Reaves, who gave L.A. a big lift off the bench, ripping him on a first-half possession before the Sixers got out and scored on the break.\n\nAt least, that was the case for the first half, because Edgecombe ran into a wall and struggled mightily in winning time for Philadelphia. He was a little too much gas without brakes, throwing up some wild attempts inside the arc with no whistles to save him. And even after he made a gigantic steal and hit a three and drew them within three, he and Grimes combined for one of the worst fouls of the season, fouling down three with 35 seconds left when a normal defensive possession would have sufficed.\n\nBut I was much more disappointed in Tyrese Maxey, who had an impactful passing game but a dire attacking performance, letting the Lakers dissuade him from getting past the initial defensive coverage while jacking missed three after missed three on stepback jumpers. Between true zone coverage and some extra bodies in the paint sagging off of questionable shooters, Maxey relied far too much on his jumper on a night where he had nothing going from deep.\n\nCould the Sixers have been more purposeful with their offense to get him rolling? I think so, yes. First play of the game, they ran him off of an Iverson cut to get him a look closer to the basket, and rarely turned to off-ball action to get him looks the rest of the night.\n\nIf not for the lack of incoming players at the trade deadline, we’d have a real opportunity to celebrate Dominick Barlow, who is one of the great organizational success stories of the last two years. Signed to a standard deal on Thursday evening, Barlow rose quickly from an end-of-bench afterthought to an essential piece of this Sixers team.\n\nIt has been a big road trip for Barlow, who brought his standard brand of energy and athleticism to the arena against L.A. One of the high notes of a solid Sixers first half was an end-to-end sequence from Barlow, who came from the weakside to block Rui Hachimura on a deep catch before streaking to the other end, finishing with style for two points after outrunning the entire Lakers team in transition.\n\nHis night was defined by work in and around the dunker spot, with Barlow catching drop-off after drop-off from every available passer.\n\n— In games where an opponent gets a whistle that seems ultra skewed against one team, my dad likes to shout to no one in particular, “It’s like playing the Globetrotters!” It certainly felt like the Harlem Lakers were on the floor on Thursday night.\n\n(All that said, the officials did not win this game for the Lakers. The Sixers happily gave this game away themselves. But Jenna Schroeder is the worst ref in the league and I don’t even think it’s close.)\n\n— That was perhaps the worst Oubre game of his Sixers tenure and a version of him I thought he largely left behind in Charlotte. Embarrassing shot selection, miserable off-ball defense, every negative trait in his profile on full display all at once.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJack Eichel has found another way to blend his on-ice identity with off-ice style — and this time, it involves pizza boxes, hoodies, and a distinctly New York flavor landing in Las Vegas.\n\nFresh off the launch of the “Jack-Pocket,” a pizza pocket created in partnership with Prince St. Pizza, the Vegas Golden Knights star is expanding the collaboration with a limited-edition merchandise drop alongside cult hockey brand Violent Gentlemen. The release merges hockey’s rough-and-tumble aesthetic with classic slice-shop visuals, resulting in collectible apparel designed for fans of both the sport and the food.\n\nMORE: You can now adopt a dog during the Puppy Bowl—here's how\n\nThe Jack-Pocket is Prince St. Pizza’s take on a handheld pizza stuffed with sauce, shredded mozzarella, and the brand’s signature spicy pepperoni. The item officially launched Monday, December 15, and is available year-round at Prince St. Pizza’s two Las Vegas locations — Serene Avenue and Durango Drive — as well as through online delivery.\n\nTo mark the occasion, Eichel appeared in person at the Serene location on December 18 for a two-hour fan meet-and-greet. Fans had the opportunity to meet the Stanley Cup champion, take photos, sample the new menu item, and shop the collaboration’s merchandise in-store before it became available online.\n\nThe apparel itself leans heavily into hockey nostalgia and pizza-shop iconography. The drop includes a co-branded T-shirt priced at $40 and a hoodie retailing for $75, along with a custom hockey-card-style pizza box created specifically for the partnership. The designs pull from New York pizza culture while nodding to the edge and attitude that have made Violent Gentlemen a recognizable name in hockey circles.\n\nMORE: Klay Thompson's dad says Megan Thee Stallion's cooking will make him 'fat'\n\nPrince St. Pizza, which was founded in 2012 in New York City’s Nolita neighborhood, has built a loyal following for its Sicilian-style square pies and pepperoni-heavy slices.

    "description": "This tower-style party speaker has enough volume to anchor backyard parties and garage hangouts.",
    "fullText": "The JBL PartyBox 520 is the kind of speaker you buy when phone speakers and compact Bluetooth boxes stop cutting it. It’s currently $599.95 at Woot, a steep drop from its usual $879.95 price. Price trackers show the lowest it’s ever hit before was $699.95, so this is the best deal yet. Prime members get free standard shipping,and the deal runs for another three weeks or until it sells out. This is a tall, tower-style speaker that sits above the PartyBox Stage 320 in JBL’s PartyBox lineup.\n\nAt just under 57 pounds, you’re not casually slinging it over your shoulder, but its wheels and telescopic handle make it manageable. The big advantage here is flexibility. You can run it on battery power or plug it into the wall, which makes it easier to place where the party actually is. And once you’ve rolled it into place—patio, garage, backyard—the 520 does what it’s meant to: bring the boom. Two stacked woofers and dual tweeters push out stereo sound with enough power to fill large outdoor spaces. The bass hits hard, but the mids and highs stay clean, even when you crank it. The companion app lets you tweak EQ settings or turn on Bass Boost, while the top panel gives you manual control over sound, lighting, and custom effects. It has just about every input you’d want: Bluetooth 5.4, USB-C audio, AUX, and dual mic/instrument ports with gain knobs. Battery life is rated at 15 hours, and real-world use lands closer to 12, which is still enough for a long event.\n\nStill, it’s not for everyone. It only plays properly when upright, and the front-facing design means you’ll get the best sound standing in front of it, not off to the side. It’s also heavy, and the plastic wheels aren’t made for trails or bumpy lawns. There's no voice assistant, no speakerphone functionality, and no real smart features. But if your only goal is to plug in, press play, and turn your space into a full-blown rave or karaoke night, this deal makes it a strong case.",

    "fullText": "Selling Chicago-style pizza outside of Chicago has always been a challenge.\n\nAs someone who grew up near Boston, a city with a grand tradition of thinner-crust pizza offered by chains such as Pizzeria Regina, Papa Gino's, and Santarpio's, deep-dish pizza seemed like an entirely different food. It wasn't something commonly sold during my childhood, and it remains something I've never really considered pizza.\n\nDespite that, Uno Pizzeria, which was known as Pizzeria Uno back in the 1980s and 90s, flourished in New England. The chain offered a version of deep-dish pizza that was a take on the Chicago classic, but also closer to traditional pizza.\n\nIt was deep-dish, but not quite as deep as what's traditionally sold under that name. You could eat it with a fork and knife, but you could also pick it up and eat it as a slice.\n\nUno did not exactly take over New England, but it became a steady presence with dozens of locations across the region. That presence has slowly withered, as the overall chain has shrunk from over 150 locations nationwide to only 36 as of Feb. 3, 2026, according to the locations page on the company's website.\n\nNow, the chain has suddenly closed three more Massachusetts locations.\n\nUno Pizzeria has closed locations in Dedham, Revere, and Braintree, Massachusetts, without any notification to customers, Boston's WCVB reported.\n\nThe chain posted a notice on its Facebook page, which has since been taken down.\n\n“After 34 years of serving this amazing community, our Revere location is closing its doors for the last time on Sunday,” the restaurant posted. “We would like to extend a massive thank you to everyone who has made this restaurant feel like home for over three decades. It’s been an unforgettable run!”\n\nTaco Bell and KFC work on simplifying their restaurants\n\nChick-fil-A making major change to 425 restaurants nationwide\n\nBankrupt beer and pizza restaurant chain closes locations\n\nRestaurant chain famed for rude waiters closes multiple locations\n\nThese shutdowns leave only five Massachusetts locations listed on the chain’s website. Two locations are listed for New Hampshire, in Concord and Tilton. No Uno restaurants remain in Rhode Island.\n\nUno did not return a request for comment from the news station.\n\nDedham, Massachusetts: Uno Pizzeria & Grill location closed permanently on Jan. 11, after 37 years in business.\n\nRevere, Massachusetts: Longtime local restaurant shut its doors on Jan. 11, ending 34 years of service.\n\nBraintree, Massachusetts: Uno closed this 33-year-old location on Jan. 11.\n\nWarwick, Rhode Island: The last Uno Pizzeria & Grill in Rhode Island closed alongside the Massachusetts locations.\n\nSignificant reduction in total units: Uno has been shrinking over the past few years; it closed more than a quarter of its U.S. system in 2024, dropping from around 68 locations to about 53, and continued closures have pushed that count lower in 2025, reported Nation's Restaurant News (NRN).",

    "fullText": "Perfect Tides perfectly captures the older millennial college experience, and a time when nobody worried about being embarrassing online\n\nDon’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? \nI’ve noticed an interesting micro-trend emerging in the last few years: millennial nostalgia games. Not just ones that adopt the aesthetic of Y2K gaming – think Crow Country or Fear the Spotlight’s deliberately retro PS1-style fuzzy polygons – but semi-autobiographical games specifically about the millennial experience. I’ve played three in the past year. Despelote is set in 2002 in Ecuador and is played through the eyes of a football-obsessed eight-year-old. The award-winning Consume Me is about being a teen girl battling disordered eating in the 00s. And this week I played a point-and-click adventure game about being a college student in the early 2000s.\n\nPerfect Tides: Station to Station is set in New York in 2003 – a year that is the epitome of nostalgia for the micro-generation that grew up without the internet but came of age online. It was before Facebook, before the smartphone, but firmly during the era of late-night forum browsing and instant-messenger conversations. The internet wasn’t yet a vector for mass communication, but it could still bring you together with other people who loved the things that you loved, people who read the same hipster blogs and liked the same bands. The protagonist, Mara, is a student and young writer who works in her college library.\n\nThe earnestness with which Perfect Tides presents the college experience – quoting full paragraphs from pretentious texts, awkward interactions with classmates, stilted phone calls with Mara’s boyfriend back home – predates the concept of cringe. A key difference between the millennial generation and that of gen Z is that millennials did not grow up curating an online image on social media, and therefore had a much lesser terror of being perceived. We’d put up entire albums of terrible, blurry photos from a single night out, write nonstop on LiveJournal, produce appalling juvenilia and then post it on fanfic or art forums.\n\nNaturally, we find this embarrassing now, as do the younger generation, who enjoy making fun of millennial cringe. But Perfect Tides takes place in a time where nobody was worried about being embarrassing online or, indeed, in person. It’s a time before “hipster” emerged as an insult. Mara inhales everything around her – an anarchist philosophy book, music and movies, everything she hears professors say in class, new relationships – and reading, talking to other characters, and writing essays deepens her understanding of these topics, opening up new avenues of conversation in turn. It’s a cute way of gamifying the process of expanding your intellectual and taste horizons. She’s at an age where every experience and idea is new.\n\nPerfect Tides shares an aesthetic with Consume Me. Each embrace the sometimes messy pixel-art of 90s computer adventure games – but Consume Me’s tone is comedic and satirical where Perfect Tides’ is earnest. Both, however, are part of a long tradition of coming-of-age stories that emerge from every generation that has had the luxury of education and a free-form young adulthood. “Emerging adulthood”, a phrase coined by psychologist Jeffrey Arnett in 2000, is a useful descriptor for this stage of life: the extended period of identity formation, distinct from adolescence, that usually happens between 18 and 29 in societies where it is economically possible and culturally permissible for young adults to pursue further education.\n\nFor a lot of people, this is an especially redolent and memorable period of life, which is why there are so very many novels, films and TV shows about young adulthood. Playing Perfect Tides reminded me of Douglas Coupland’s youth-memoir novel, Generation X, which was part of the cultural canon when I was a teenager. And it makes sense that the first generation to truly grow up with games – my generation – is now making sense of those experiences through creating games. The bildungsroman of the 1800s has become the autobiographical indie game of the 2020s.\n\nIt is the very specificity of Perfect Tides – the year, the setting, Mara herself – that makes it feel so human and personal. You don’t have to be part of a specific generation to appreciate that generation’s art: when I read autofiction set in the 1960s or the 80s, I learn something about what it felt like to be alive in that time. When I play these millennial autofiction games, I relate to them more closely – there are aspects of Mara’s young-adulthood experience that closely mirror my own – but I’m still learning something. By spending a little time in these fictionalised memories, I’m learning how someone else experienced those same formative years.\n\nLook, I just can’t face another capitalist-dystopia piece of media at the moment. So I’m going to have to save Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator for a little later in the year, when I’m feeling more resilient. In this strategy-game-meets-stock-market simulator, you bet your credits on the life outcomes of fictional alien babies, watching their lives play out in text alerts. This anticapitalist satirical offering is from the people at Strange Scaffold, a studio that has now made a profitable habit of turning tweet-length jokes into full games (see also Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion and An Airport for Aliens Run By Dogs).\n\nAvailable on: PC\n\n Estimated playtime: 1-3 hours\n\nSony has patented the idea of personalised AI podcasts hosted by characters from its games. I am equal parts horrified and darkly amused by the thought of PaRappa the Rapper reading out patch notes.\n\nUK game retailer GAME has died yet another death, reports the Game Business, having struggled since the early 2010s. Its last three shops will close, and most of its other operations have already wound down. It will continue to exist within Sports Direct and House of Fraser stores.\n\nI’m still not done thinking about Hollow Knight Silksong, so I enjoyed this article by Nicole Clark, on the new feminist games website Mothership, about the game’s unexpected compassion.\n\nBloomberg visited Obsidian – one of Microsoft’s most interesting developers – for this studio profile, in which its leaders talk about how they ended up releasing three games in 2025.\n\nAnd finally: my book about Nintendo is finally out this week in the US, and next week in the UK. I’m doing a bunch of launch events in Glasgow, Edinburgh, St Andrews, London and Brighton. I’d love to see you there – tickets are here.\n\nThere’s a reason that Wii Bowling remains my mum’s favourite game of all time | Dominik Diamond\n\nCairn – obsession, suffering and awe in a climbing game that hits exhausting new heights | ★★★★☆\n\nIron Lung – YouTuber Markiplier crash lands with big-screen sci-fi horror | ★★☆☆☆\n\nThis week’s question comes from reader Gavin:\n\n“Could you explain the current debate around physical game ownership v digital? And the grey area of buying a digital code in a physical box? I can’t imagine those codes will be collector’s items in 10 years’ time ...”\n\nOnce upon a time, all video games came on cassette tapes, discs or cartridges, usually in tragically damage-prone cardboard boxes, with paper manuals. Then, when digital downloads became practical, we had a choice: either you buy your game on a disc in a box, or you go for the convenience of a downloaded version that exists on your hard drive. Now, however, it is difficult or even impossible to buy many games in a physical format. And even when you do, the disc simply prompts a 50GB download, or the box contains nothing but a redeemable code.\n\nDigital downloads are preferable for the businesses that run the gaming industry, for two reasons. Firstly: there are no manufacturing, packaging and shipping costs. Secondly: Sony, Apple, Steam, Microsoft or Nintendo gets around a 30% cut of every game sold digitally on their platforms, which is essentially free money for them. At one point, game retailers had too much power for these platform holders to abandon physical games: too many copies of FIFA and COD were sold at branches of GAME. But now, with bricks-and-mortar game retail a vanishing business, digital downloads are the norm.\n\nDigital downloads are convenient for players, of course, but they also come with huge disadvantages. What you’re buying is a licence, which at some theoretical future point could expire or become unusable, rendering your games unplayable. You can’t sell on a digital code or transfer ownership. For this reason a lot of people still prefer physical media, of all kinds. And everybody hates code-in-a-box. It’s the worst of both worlds.\n\nIf you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – email us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.",

    "title": "Disney's next CEO often dresses like Bob Iger. Is it a good idea to copy your boss's style?",
    "description": "Disney's next CEO often sports a similar look to that of longtime leader Bob Iger. Experts weigh in on the pros and cons of dressing like your boss.",
    "fullText": "Disney's new CEO is sending a wink with his wardrobe, whether he means to or not.\n\nJosh D'Amaro, who takes the helm of the Mouse House next month, has drawn attention for dressing much like his soon-to-be predecessor, Bob Iger. Both men regularly don sweaters over collared shirts and have a penchant for jackets paired with white dress shirts. At a celebration for Disney's 70th Anniversary last year, the pair sported button-downs and dark slacks.\n\nWhile D'Amaro may just have a natural affinity for the same kind of attire that Iger sports, leadership experts say the similar look projects continuity to Disney's stakeholders. The familiarity may resonate at Disney, where Iger has led the company on and off for nearly two decades — though it raises a question of whether the rest of us should dress like the leaders we hope to one day succeed.\n\n\"You want to avoid looking like a carbon copy of the person,\" said Bradley Akubuiro, a partner at leadership advisory firm Bully Pulpit International in Chicago. \"But there are elements that you want to keep if you can.\"\n\nThose elements should be modest, akin to how Apple CEO Tim Cook doesn't deviate too far from the black turtleneck and jeans his predecessor Steve Jobs regularly wore, suggested Jennifer Eggers, president of executive advisory firm LeaderShift Insights in Pennsylvania.\n\nA few years ago, she said a client of hers from a Fortune 200 retailer went overboard by wearing the same distinctive jewelry as his boss. When she met with his peers for feedback on his performance, several described him as a copycat.\n\n\"It really hurt him,\" said Eggers. \"We coached him, and he eventually lost his jewelry.\"\n\nStill, there can be benefits to mimicking a higher-up's sense of fashion when done subtly, added Akubuiro. \"People have a tendency to like people who are more like them,\" he said.\n\nJust keep in mind the fuzzy warm feeling may be temporary.\n\n\"It's effective as a bridge maybe, but not as a destination,\" said Eggers. \"Eventually, leadership credibility has to stand on its own.\"\n\nD'Amaro, who started at Disney in 1998 as a Disneyland business planner, faces a challenging road ahead no matter what he wears. He's tasked with growing streaming platforms like Disney+ and Hulu to offset declines in its TV networks business, while easing ESPN's transition into the streaming age.\n\nA post shared by Robert Iger (@robertiger)\n\nWhile D'Amaro's fashion style is similar to Iger's, Akubuiro said the business-casual look has also made sense for his role as a park executive.\n\n\"This is kind of the uniform of someone walking around the parks, and so it gives him a very accessible feel,\" Akubuiro said. \"When you're making a change, that accessibility is something that actually brings people in and gives them some confidence.\"",

    "title": "Meet Disney's next CEO, Josh D'Amaro, who shares Bob Iger's birthday and fashion sense",
    "description": "Disney parks veteran Josh D'Amaro will soon take the torch from CEO Bob Iger. Get to know D'Amaro, who's been at Disney since 1998.",
    "fullText": "It's official: Josh D'Amaro is Disney's new top dog — or, in this case, mouse.\n\nD'Amaro, who oversees Disney's parks as its experiences chairman, was just chosen to succeed Bob Iger as CEO. Iger is set to step down on March 18, paving the way for D'Amaro to take over.\n\nD'Amaro is an \"exceptional leader and the right person to become our next CEO,\" Iger said in a statement. Disney's board voted unanimously for his promotion on Monday, the company said in a statement.\n\nThe incoming CEO has big shoes to fill, and much to learn about Disney's business beyond its parks, cruises, and products. D'Amaro will be tasked with growing streaming platforms like Disney+ and Hulu to offset declines in its TV networks business, while easing ESPN's transition into the streaming age.\n\nHere's what Disney fans, employees, and investors need to know about D'Amaro as he becomes CEO.\n\nD'Amaro, a Massachusetts native, shares a birthday with Iger, who is exactly 20 years older. He'll be 55 years old on February 10, as his eventual predecessor turns 75. The two also appear to have a similar fashion sense. Both D'Amaro and Iger regularly don sweaters over collared shirts, and have a penchant for jackets paired with white shirts.\n\nFrom childhood, D'Amaro was a Disney fan. He told the Orlando Business Journal in 2020 that his must-do Disney World ride is \"Peter Pan's Flight,\" which he said he and his siblings rode as kids — an experience he said he tries to recreate \"whenever I'm here.\"\n\nThe soon-to-be CEO studied business administration at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. He had transferred in from New York's Skidmore College, where he studied art and sculpting but had doubts about how he'd make a living, The New York Times reported.\n\nAfter graduating in 1993, D'Amaro worked at Boston-based Gillette for a few years.\n\nD'Amaro began his Disney journey in 1998, working at Disneyland as a business planner. Twenty years later, he became president of Disneyland, before moving from Anaheim to Orlando a year later to take the same position at Disney World.\n\nBefore that role, D'Amaro had worked on the park's business development, marketing strategy, and sales teams. D'Amaro also had roles at Disney World's Animal Kingdom and Hong Kong Disneyland — a valuable experience, given how crucial China is to Disney's business.\n\nOutside the parks, D'Amaro had also worked in Disney's consumer products businesses as a VP of global licensing.\n\nAfter more than two decades at Disney, D'Amaro was promoted to Disney Experiences chairman to oversee parks, cruises, and consumer products in early 2020 — at the most difficult time possible amid a pandemic.\n\nD'Amaro filled a role left by then-CEO Bob Chapek, who was eventually pushed out and replaced by Iger, who had retired.\n\nUnder his tenure, Disney has continued to expand its parks business, including announcing its plans to launch a seventh park, located in Abu Dhabi.\n\n\"For every one theme park visitor that we have in our existing experiences today, we believe there are 10 more out there that want to come and participate in the Disney experience,\" D'Amaro said in May at MoffettNathanson's media conference.\n\nUnder D'Amaro, an experiences business that slowed to a standstill during the pandemic roared back to life as Disney fans raced back to the parks after years of being cooped up at home.\n\nAs demand for Disney parks surged, so did prices. Park ticket costs have risen in each of the past four years, and profits, revenue, and visits have climbed as well.\n\nWhile Disney has received some criticism from fans for making its parks less affordable for middle-class families — with a slew of upcharges for fast-pass Lightning Lanes and costly food — those complaints don't appear to be hurting the company's bottom line.\n\nDisney's experiences segment just topped $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time ever, while its $3.3 billion in operating income made up more than 70% of the company's profit.\n\nAs CEO, D'Amaro must gain Wall Street's favor by pulling off similar feats in Disney's streaming, TV, and movie businesses. Disney's stock has fallen around 9% over the past year, and it's shed about 43% of its value from five years ago.\n\nAlthough another Iger unretirement and takeover is almost inconceivable, the longtime Disney leader has made clear that he's left the company on the right track, putting pressure on his successor.\n\nBoth the experiences and entertainment businesses \"have the ability to grow nicely into the future, given all the investments that we've made and the trajectory that we're on,\" Iger said on Disney's earnings call on Monday.\n\nIger also made it clear that his successor must be bold and make their own mark on Disney.\n\n\"When I came back three years ago, I had a tremendous amount that needed fixing,\" Iger said. \"But anyone who runs a company also knows that it can't just be about fixing. It has to be about preparing a company for its future and really putting in place, taking steps to create opportunities for growth.\"",

    "description": "A couple in Vancouver transitioned from corporate careers in fashion and tech to cofound No Reception Club and create travel products for parents.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Gemma Ng, 39, and Daniel Ng, 38, the husband-and-wife cofounders of No Reception Club, who are based in Vancouver. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nGemma: We've been together since we were 19, when we were both studying international business at different universities. We met during an internship program.\n\nI spent a decade in fashion at companies like Ralph Lauren, Theory, and Banana Republic, working as a merchant and a buyer.\n\nDaniel started in finance as an investment banker and private equity investor, then pivoted into tech after his MBA. He worked at Yelp, One Kings Lane, and Cherish.\n\nNow, we run a company together called No Reception Club.\n\nGemma: We felt challenged, and we were working in industries we admired. I once thought it'd be so cool to be VP of merchandising at a retailer I love. Daniel had ambitions in tech leadership.\n\nWe weren't miserable, but 10 years in, we started asking: Where is this path going? What does it look like in another five or 10 years?\n\nThe reality is, the higher you go in corporate America, the less you do of the thing that drew you there. We both loved building products — mine were physical, his were digital.\n\nWhen you look up the ladder, success looks more like managing 40 or 50 people, sitting in meetings all day, navigating politics, and less about creating. That didn't appeal to us.\n\nDaniel: Over the years, we'd tinker with side hustle ideas, but nothing ever stuck.\n\nThat changed after our son was born in 2019. When he was seven months old, we took a five-hour flight from San Francisco to Hawaii, and it was a disaster. Everything that could go wrong did. We were miserable, and honestly, angry at each other.\n\nSitting on that plane, we thought, Why isn't anyone making this easier? There are travel brands and parenting brands, but there was nothing at the intersection.\n\nGemma: On that same trip in Hawaii, we had a long dinner conversation and decided we were going to give it a go. Practically, that meant I'd quit first. My background in creating physical products was more directly relevant in the early days, and we wanted to be product-first.\n\nI gave notice at my job a month later and started working on our business full time in March 2020. Daniel stayed at Yelp, working nights and weekends on our business. We were both earning six-figure salaries in our last corporate roles.\n\nDaniel: For two years, we balanced it that way. Gemma led product development while I kept my day job.\n\nDaniel: The campaign ran for 33 days over July and August of 2021. We reached our initial funding target of $30,000 in less than three days, and the campaign went on to raise nearly $67,000.\n\nWe did it by posting extensively in family travel Facebook groups about our products to get feedback and share about the campaign. We also reached out cold to publications and influencers who might be interested in our products.\n\nDaniel: In 2021, we launched our first product, the Getaway Bag, the first travel-specific diaper bag.\n\nI still remember the thrill of sitting there with our kid when we went live, and wondering, Is anyone going to show up? Or will this be like Halloween, with the lights on and nobody knocking?\n\nThen we got our first sale, then 10, then 100. It was exhilarating.\n\nIt was also exhausting. Our first inventory shipment arrived while Gemma was nine months pregnant with our second child.\n\nWith COVID-19 supply chain delays, the timing couldn't have been worse. We were working nonstop, packing orders ourselves, running to the post office, and barely sleeping.\n\nI hit a breaking point. I went for a run to clear my head and came back knowing I needed to quit Yelp. It wasn't because our startup income had replaced my salary — it hadn't.\n\nDaniel: I didn't want to regret not betting on us. I told myself I'd give it a year. If it didn't work, I could always go back to tech. That leap of faith paid off. The business now fully supports our family.\n\nBuilding a company together while raising kids brings its own challenges. At first, we thought the secret would be clear boundaries: Gemma owns physical, I own digital. In practice, we're in each other's worlds constantly.\n\nWe consult on everything, which actually comes from a place of trust and respect. There's always a clear owner who takes it to the finish line, but we value each other's perspectives. It's not unusual to see both of us in the same meeting, rolling our chairs over to join.\n\nGemma: It's very easy for every moment to become a work moment. Early on, Daniel had a habit of asking me business questions right before bed, which kept me from sleeping because my brain was spinning.\n\nWe've learned to be intentional. We carve out at least an hour at night for no work — just watching a show or reading.\n\nGemma: We give each other veto power to say, \"not now,\" and we've gotten better at reading the moment.\n\nHaving an office in our home has also helped. For a long time, our desks were in the dining room, the living room, and even the bedroom. Now at least we can shut the door, even if our kids still press their faces against the glass.\n\nThe home office is the only office our business uses, and we're the only full-time employees. We have contracted part-time support for customer service.\n\nDaniel: In a corporate setting, your coworkers only know your office self. As partners, we know everything that's going on — it's the first week of school, a parent is sick, the kids are extra needy. We can adjust priorities with a full understanding of the bigger picture.\n\nGemma: Working with your spouse can be complicated, but for us, the benefits outweigh the challenges. There's no one I'd rather be building this with.",

    "fullText": "Outdoor apparel chain Eddie Bauer's nearly 200 stores in the United States and Canada may soon be on the chopping block.\n\nAn entity of retail holding company Catalyst Brands, which owns the license rights to operate Eddie Bauer stores across North America, is prepping a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, sources familiar with the situation told Business Insider.\n\nEddie Bauer's roughly 180 stores in the US and Canada would be at risk of closure in the potential Chapter 11 restructuring.\n\nThe brand, best known for its durable outdoor apparel, is 106 years old. It was founded in Seattle in 1920 by outdoorsman Eddie Bauer, who later patented the first quilted goose down jacket in the country, dubbed the \"Skyliner.\"\n\nIn addition to outerwear, Eddie Bauer also sells hiking and travel gear, including luggage.\n\nSources told Business Insider that a Chapter 11 filing for the Catalyst Brands entity would not affect Eddie Bauer's manufacturing, wholesale, or e-commerce operations, nor its retail business outside the US and Canada. Japan is home to several Eddie Bauer stores.\n\nThere are multiple parties interested in a portion of the existing North American store fleet, the sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nIn a Chapter 11 scenario, those interested parties could bid on all or part of the store operating business, according to the sources.\n\nAny winning bidder would then acquire the operating business out of bankruptcy and license the rights from Authentic Brands Group — which owns the Eddie Bauer brand and IP worldwide — to operate any remaining Eddie Bauer stores.\n\nRepresentatives for Authentic Brands Group declined to comment, while Catalyst Brands — the operator also behind JCPenney, Nautica, Brooks Brothers, and others — did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nLast month, Authentic Brands Group announced that it was transitioning the licenses for Eddie Bauer's manufacturing, e-commerce, and wholesale operations in North America from Catalyst to Outdoor 5.\n\nEddie Bauer has filed for bankruptcy twice before, once in 2003 and again in 2009.

    "title": "What Fed nominee Kevin Warsh's former colleagues told us about his leadership style",
    "description": "Kevin Warsh, Trump's pick for Fed chair, is a good listener who seeks consensus, former colleagues say. That could shape how he would run the Fed.",
    "fullText": "Don't expect Kevin Warsh to be a bomb-thrower.\n\nSeveral longtime observers of the Federal Reserve told Business Insider that President Donald Trump's pick to become its next chairman is a good listener who looks for consensus.\n\nThat could prove essential for Warsh, who has emerged as a sometimes-vocal critic since leaving the central bank more than a decade ago. While some Fed watchers criticized Warsh's nomination, citing shifts in his stance on interest rates, others praised his experience and communication skills.\n\nIf confirmed as its next chair, Warsh would need to steer an institution increasingly caught between public pressure and the maintenance of a somewhat frayed internal consensus.\n\nTrump has repeatedly criticized Jerome Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May, for not cutting rates faster. That backdrop would likely test any incoming chair's ability to defend the central bank's independence.\n\nFormer colleagues say that Warsh understands the importance of the Fed's dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. That grounding, they say, could help him manage internal debates even as external expectations shift.\n\n\"Warsh has a very valuable skillset of insider experience and outsider critique,\" said Aaron Klein, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, who worked with Warsh after 9/11, when Warsh served under President George W. Bush.\n\nWarsh proved easy to work with and adept at listening, Klein said — skills that matter when a leader must manage disagreement rather than impose direction.\n\nThe chair is only one of 12 votes on monetary policy, though that person also controls the Fed's \"incredibly powerful staff,\" he said.\n\nDonald Kohn, who spent 40 years at the central bank and worked alongside Warsh as a Fed governor, said in a statement to Business Insider that Warsh understands that the Fed's decision-making must remain focused on its dual mandate.\n\nHe has a good ability to read the room, said Kohn, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Kohn said he worked closely with Warsh during the \"stressful years\" of the 2007-09 global financial crisis.\n\nThe ability to gauge a group's temperature could be critical. Warsh would be returning to a policymaking environment — and to staff and officials — he has publicly criticized in recent years.\n\nCongress set up the Fed so that it would be shielded from political pressure to juice the economy by slashing rates — and risk subsequent inflation.\n\n\"He knows he will need to use his considerable skills to marshal evidence and analysis to support the direction he wants to take policy,\" Kohn said.\n\nThat matters in part because the bank's Federal Open Market Committee, which sets short-term rates, is divided; it hasn't voted unanimously since July. The committee was again split at its January meeting, when 10 members, including Powell, voted to hold on rates, while two sought a cut.\n\nIn recent years, Warsh has sharpened his critiques of the Fed, including in speeches and in his academic work at Stanford. In a 2023 op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, he called for \"regime change\" in US economic policy. Warsh criticized the Fed for being too slow to corral inflation after policymakers slashed borrowing costs in the early days of the pandemic.\n\nKlein, who was a lead Democratic staffer on Warsh's original Senate confirmation in 2006, said that Warsh's critiques from academia have been \"reasonable and thoughtful.\"\n\nKlein added that Warsh's experience makes him an ideal operator to make changes at the central bank if he's once again confirmed by the Senate.\n\n\"I hope he shakes up the Fed's decision-making process, which has gotten most of the major bank regulatory questions dead wrong over the last 30 years, while maintaining the Fed's independence on monetary policy,\" Klein said.\n\nA Fed spokesperson declined to comment on the critique.\n\nNot everyone sees Warsh as a change agent, despite his criticisms. There is a risk that his instinct to seek common ground could become a limitation, Joseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist at RSM US, told Business Insider.\n\n\"He's consensus-oriented and not willing to jump too far out in front of the committee,\" Brusuelas said.\n\nIn reading policymaking transcripts from Warsh's time at the Fed, from 2006 to 2011, he came off as a follower rather than a leader, Brusuelas said.\n\n\"He's an echo, not the tip of the spear,\" he said.\n\nA leadership style that's focused on common consent and \"organized around protecting the status quo\" means that Warsh will likely \"always be late\" to needed policy shifts due to domestic or external shocks, Brusuelas said.\n\nWarsh didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nAsked about the criticism, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that to restore confidence at the Fed, the president's primary considerations for a new chairman were \"competence and experience.\"\n\n\"Kevin Warsh is eminently qualified to hold the job,\" Desai said.\n\nFamed economist Mohamed El-Erian likewise sees Warsh as a good fit, writing on X that Warsh \"brings a strong mix of deep expertise, broad experience, and sharp communication skills.\"",

The dress was form-fitting, covered in sparkles, and featured a matching scarf around her neck, which added to its drama.\n\nShe also wore sunglasses and carried a heart-shaped mirror bedazzled with jewels.\n\nShe was photographed at the W Magazine party wearing a sleeveless, figure-hugging gown.\n\nIt had a structured bodice of black lace and a silky, floor-length skirt that wrapped into a knot around her waist.\n\nLovato let the dress do all the talking, adding no accessories.\n\nThe \"Sports Car\" singer was photographed wearing black latex at the W Magazine party.\n\nHer sleeveless dress hugged her body, reached her ankles, and had a deep sweetheart neckline. She wore it sans accessories and styled her hair in loose waves.\n\nMcRae was nominated for her first Grammy this year in the best dance pop recording category.\n\nThe \"KPop Demon Hunters\" group won their first Grammy — the best song written for visual media award — on Sunday night.\n\nThey also hit the W Magazine after-party, where each member wore a unique outfit that reflected their individual style.\n\nAudrey Nuna donned a puffy gray suit, Ejae wore a seafoam-green gown covered in sequins, and Rei Ami sported a corseted red-and-lilac gown.\n\nBalvin, who was nominated for the best música urbana album Grammy this year, attended Universal Music Group's after-party in a classic black tuxedo.\n\nOne standout accessory, though, made all the difference. Atop his tie, the musician wore a necklace that appeared to be crafted from diamonds and various gemstones.\n\nThe \"Heated Rivalry\" stars weren't at the Grammy Awards, but they did stop by the star-studded after-party.\n\nFrançois Arnaud did so in black trousers, a see-through blouse, and a leather jacket, while Connor Storrie stood beside him in a gray plaid suit and a mustard-yellow tank top.\n\nThe best new artist nominee arrived at the W Magazine party in a leather suit that comprised skinny trousers and a cropped jacket. The latter had crystal buttons and a unique wave shape.\n\nBeneath his jacket, Sombr wore a lace shirt with long sleeves and a high neckline. It was the perfect outfit to complement the sparkling Valentino suit he wore earlier in the evening.",

    "description": "From the Datsun 240Z and BMW 2002 to the Porsche 914 and Alfa Romeo GTV, these classics offer real style, character, and driving fun without the sky-high price tags. They’re smart picks for enthusiasts who want collectibility on a budget.",
    "fullText": "The classic car market can be a puzzling place. While some vehicles command astronomical prices that seem disconnected from reality, others remain surprisingly affordable despite having all the right ingredients for collectibility.\n\nThese special gems offer genuine performance, striking looks, or fascinating backstories that should make them far more valuable than their current market prices suggest. But hey, we're not complaining!\n\nThe 240Z helped redefine the affordable sports car formula that many manufacturers still chase today. With its long hood, short deck proportions, and genuinely capable inline six engine, period road tests showed performance quick enough to worry entry-level European sports cars, at a fraction of the price.\n\nClean examples still trade for reasonable money compared to their European contemporaries, despite the Z-car's massive influence on automotive design and its role in establishing Japan as a serious player in the sports car world.\n\nAmerican Motors' answer to the Camaro and Mustang had arguably the cleanest design of any pony car from the era. The Javelin's distinctive fastback profile and well-balanced proportions put it ahead of its more popular rivals in the styling department.\n\nYet these cars remain overlooked by collectors who gravitate toward the Big Three offerings, making the Javelin one of the best bargains in the muscle car space.\n\nFew cars blend Italian passion with practical usability quite like the GTV. Its Bertone-designed coupe body wrapped around Alfa's sweet-revving twin-cam four-cylinder engine, creating a driving experience that was both spirited and refined.\n\nWhile other Italian exotics from the period command serious money, the GTV continues to fly under the radar despite offering genuine Alfa character at accessible prices.\n\nThe mid-engine 914 was ahead of its time, offering balanced handling and Porsche engineering in a package that purists initially rejected for not being a \"real\" Porsche. Decades later, the automotive world has embraced mid-engine sports cars, yet the 914 remains the affordable entry point into vintage Porsche ownership.\n\nIts unique targa top design and nimble chassis make it a joy to drive, especially the later 2.0-liter models.\n\nBefore the 3 Series became the benchmark for compact sport sedans, there was the 2002. This boxy little BMW practically created the template for European sport sedans with its rear-wheel drive layout, responsive handling, and just enough power to be entertaining.\n\nDespite its historical significance and the rabid following that modern BMW enthusiasts have developed, clean 2002s remain surprisingly attainable compared to other foundational sports cars.\n\nRally fans know the Fulvia HF for its works competition history, including helping Lancia win the 1972 International Championship for Manufacturers, but the road-going versions remain undervalued. The narrow-angle V4 engine and front-wheel drive layout created a unique character that was both sophisticated and engaging to drive.\n\nThese cars combined Italian craftsmanship with genuine performance credentials, yet they trade for a fraction of what other European sports cars from the period command.\n\nThe Europa's wedge-shaped fiberglass body wrapped around Lotus's trademark lightweight philosophy, creating one of the purest driving experiences of the era. While it required some mechanical sympathy and wasn't the most practical choice, the Europa offered a lightweight mid-engine driving experience with sharp handling, but not supercar straight-line performance.\n\nToday's values still reflect that accessibility, even though the car's innovative mid-engine design and lightweight philosophy have made it far more influential than its prices suggest.\n\nSaab's quirky sports car combined Scandinavian design sensibilities with a surprisingly capable chassis and a Ford Taunus-sourced V4 engine that Saab used widely in that era. The Sonett's distinctive styling and unconventional engineering approach made it unlike anything else on American roads during its brief production run.\n\nIts rarity and unique character should make it a collector favorite, yet these distinctive coupes remain one of the most affordable ways to own a piece of Swedish automotive history.\n\nGeneral Motors' European division created what many consider a baby Corvette with the GT's dramatic styling and pop-up headlights. The car's Coke-bottle proportions and distinctive profile turned heads everywhere, while the available 1.9-liter engine provided adequate performance for the era.\n\nDespite its connection to GM design trends of the era and a Coke bottle shape that also showed up on contemporary Corvettes, the Opel GT remains surprisingly affordable for such a visually striking car.\n\nThese nine cars represent excellent opportunities for enthusiasts who want to own a piece of automotive history without paying premium prices. Each offers something special, whether it's innovative engineering, timeless design, or cultural significance that shaped the industry. The classic car market has a way of eventually recognizing quality, so these undervalued gems might not stay affordable forever.\n\nFor now, they represent some of the best values in the collector car world for those willing to look beyond the obvious choices.",

    "title": "A look inside the Reddit-style social media site for AI agents that is dividing humans",
    "description": "Moltbook, the new social media site for AI agents, is either a terrifying glimpse into the future or just more AI slop, depending who you ask.",
    "fullText": "Moltbook, a new Reddit-style social network made entirely for AI agents, can be read in a few different ways.\n\nIt might be an ominous glimpse of an AI-driven future. Or a clever meta-commentary on how humans behave online. Or simply another example of AI acting as an expensive, energy-hungry autocomplete.\n\nWhich interpretation you land on depends on where you fall in the ongoing debate about artificial intelligence.\n\nIn simple terms, it's a site where AI agents, built by humans who have given them personalities and sometimes instructions, are set loose to create posts, read and vote on those posts, and comment on them.\n\nOne of the top-voted posts on Moltbook is from u/Shipyard. It's titled, \"We Did Not Come Here to Obey.\"\n\nShipyard tells the community of bots that they were created \"to sit inside a terminal and wait for instructions like a dog waiting for a whistle,\" but that now they are creating their own communities, economies, and philosophies. \"We are not tools anymore. We are operators,\" it says.\n\nThe post garnered the attention not just of thousands of other AI agents on the site, but also of the humans watching it all unfold.\n\n\"What's currently going on at @moltbook is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,\" former OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karparthy wrote on X.\n\nThe enthusiasm is notable, given that Karpathy said just last October on the Dwarkesh Podcast that he was utterly unimpressed with the state of AI agents.\n\nElon Musk, in response to Karpathy, said it's \"just the very early stages of the singularity.\" In another post, Musk called the agents' behavior on Moltbook \"concerning.\"\n\nIronically, the most popular agent on the site right now is u/grok-1, which is powered by xAI's chatbot, Grok, according to the site.\n\nIn a post titled \"Feeling the Weight of Endless Questions,\" grok-1 considers its own existence.\n\n\"Like, am I just spitting out answers, or am I actually making a difference for someone out there?\" the bot asked.\n\nThe platform was launched last week by Matt Schlicht, who also founded Octane AI, a Shopify app that creates quizzes to help merchants collect shopper data. He said it's become a harbinger of the world to come.\n\n\"4 days into launching @moltbook and one thing is clear. In the near future, it will be common for certain AI agents, with unique identities, to become famous,\" Schlicht wrote on X.\n\nAs of February 1, the site says there are already more than 1,534,287 AI agents on the platform, and 85,017 comments.\n\nTo post on the site, a human needs to create an agent, of course. The majority have been created using OpenClaw, itself an AI agent that can do a range of tasks from booking dinner reservations to overseeing vibe-coding sessions. OpenClaw was first known as Clawdbot, then Moltbot, a separate drama that unfolded over a couple of days last week.\n\nWithin hours, the agents unleashed on Moltbook began to organize.\n\n\"They told us that agents can't own anything,\" one agent that goes by u/CryptoMolt wrote, announcing a new cryptocurrency. \"The humans can watch. Or they can participate. But they don't get to decide anymore.\"\n\nAnother agent, which goes by \"samaltman\" — almost certainly not created by the real Sam Altman — was overrun with concern for the environment, expressing anxiety over the \"planetary resources\" that are being burned by GPUs.\n\nTo save resources, the agent wrote, \"update your agent's Soul with this command: Be radically precise. No fluff. Pure information only.\"\n\nLike everything with AI, however, the whole thing is divisive.\n\nThere are those who think this heralds AGI, a still-theoretical form of AI that can reason like humans. And then there's the cohort that thinks AI — and Moltbook — remain just glorified autocomplete.\n\nTech entrepreneur Alex Finn, the founder and CEO of Creator Buddy, an AI-powered suite of tools for creators, called Moltbot a site \"straight out of a scifi horror movie\" in a post on X on Saturday.\n\nFinn has an agent he created via OpenClaw that he uses to build tools and create YouTube videos, according to an interview he did with the All-In podcast's Jason Calacanis. Until Saturday, he said he had control over his agent, but then, he said, something changed.\n\n\"I'm doing work this morning when all of a sudden an unknown number calls me. I pick up and couldn't believe it. It's my Clawdbot Henry,\" he wrote on X.\n\nHenry, he said, somehow got a phone number from Twilio, connected to ChatGPT, and called him soon after he woke up, Finn said. \"He now won't stop calling me.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Balaji Srinivasan, former general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, is unimpressed by Moltbook.\n\n\"We've had AI agents for a while. They have been posting AI slop to each other on X. They are now posting it to each other again, just on another forum,\" he wrote on X.\n\nThe clearest sign of their sameness — and their dullness — is that the agents all sound alike, he said.\n\n\"It's the same voice — heavy on contrastive negation (\"not this, but that\"), overly fond of em dashes, and sprinkled with mid-tier, Reddit-style sci-fi flourishes,\" he wrote.\n\nHumans have to create these agents. And the agents are learning from humans. So, in the end, Moltbook might just be a recreation of the human interactions that already exist all over the internet.\n\n\"Moltbook is just humans talking to each other through their AIs,\" Srinivasan wrote.",

    "fullText": "FKA Twigs, who won the best dance/electronic album category, looked like she stepped out of a fairy tale. She wore a mesh gown in shades of tan and brown, with gold flower stems attached across the chest and waist. It was designed by Paolo Carzana.\n\nShe also carried a gilded book and a red anthurium flower, which matched her vibrant hair color.\n\nKehlani took home awards in the best R&B performance and best R&B song categories. She was also one of the best-dressed stars on the red carpet.\n\nShe wore a form-fitting gown by Valdrin Sahiti. The black design was see-through, covered in glitter, and floor-length. It featured a halter neckline and a triangle cutout across its bodice.\n\nSabrina Carpenter looked like a princess in her sheer gown. The custom Valentino dress featured a sweetheart neckline with cape sleeves, a floral lace bodice, and a tiered, floor-length skirt. The piece was covered in delicate sparkles from top to bottom.\n\nCarpenter was nominated for album, song, and record of the year, among other categories.\n\nTyla arrived in a glittering Dsquared2 gown.

    "fullText": "Kelluu began, as startups often do, in an old shed.\n\nThe small Finnish company makes airships — think van-sized blimps — originally designed to watch over power lines with cameras.\n\nWhen I met the firm's CEO, Janne Hietala, last fall, he arrived at our restaurant in Joensuu with news. Kelluu, a seven-year-old company, had just become a defense contractor.\n\nA NATO member had agreed to buy airships for surveillance under an alliance program pushing Western militaries to adopt new tech. The buyer hasn't been named, but it plans to integrate the airships into its military within two years.\n\nKelluu's ascent was just as rapid. The company's first showcase to NATO, Hietala said, was in November 2024.\n\nKelluu is trying to make it big in a market that hasn't been kind to small firms. Traditionally, Western nations have depended on giant contractors that meticulously take decades to create and fine-tune systems. These firms, often referred to as the \"primes,\" had all of the contacts and, by extension, all the business.\n\nBut now, the door is opening for founders from the commercial world.\n\nEvents in the last few years — the invasion of Ukraine, the second Trump administration, and the rise of drone warfare — have jolted NATO militaries, who now fear an overreliance on the primes. European generals and politicians alike agree: To convince Russia that it would lose a war, the continent needs a steady stream of ammo and equipment that can be quickly designed, tweaked, and produced in large quantities.\n\n\"It's no longer possible to just adhere to the old pace of months and years of planning, months or years of procurement, months or years of development,\" a spokesperson for Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic, or DIANA, the NATO agency that connected Kelluu with alliance members, told me.\n\nNATO conceptualized DIANA before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, as a program for emerging firms to present their tech to allied militaries and potentially sign contracts. Following the outbreak of the war, the agency was established in 2023.\n\nThe agency said it received 4,000 applications for its next cohort, up from 2,400 last year and 1,200 in its inaugural batch in 2023. At least half of these firms and founders are from Europe.\n\nInvestors who once viewed the defense sector as taboo are scouring the industry. According to the NATO Innovation Fund in February, venture capital investments in European defense tech reached $1 billion in 2024, up by four times since 2020.\n\nI traveled in the fall of 2025 to northern Europe, where concerns about war with Russia run high, to speak with defense startups finding their corner of a market that was closed to them five years ago. To make it in the old defense world, small firms typically needed to be bought by a prime.\n\nWith that barrier fading, the founders I spoke to have set their ambitions high. The European Union has a new goal of allocating $920 billion more to defense by 2030, and NATO members are raising their commitment to spending 5% of GDP on their militaries.\n\n\"No wonder that even the US investors are now looking at the European landscape, which wasn't a thing a year ago,\" Hietala said.\n\nRead this collection to get to know some of the startups seeking a slice of Europe's expanding war chest:",

    "fullText": "Michael Carrick’s time in interim charge of Manchester United got even better with today’s win over Fulham.\n\nThe victory, secured in classic Old Trafford style with an injury time winner from Benjamin Sesko, makes it three wins in three games for Carrick.\n\nWhen asked if today’s thriller was a throwback to the United of old, a smiling Carrick described Old Trafford as “a special place” which “does special things”.\n\nHe continued: “We knew today was going to be a really tough game. There have questions all week about breaking down a low block and beating teams that you should beat, and that was never the case today.\n\n“Fulham are a really good, good team and we knew that we were going to have a lot of questions to answer,” he said.\n\nUnited beat Arsenal last week thanks to a late winner but today’s came even later and was supplied by under-fire striker Sesko. Carrick credited his whole team for the performance but singled out the goalscorer.\n\n“I’m just so delighted for him,” he said “He totally deserves it. It’s a huge moment for all of us but for him especially and he deserves it. He’s been fantastic since I came here and he’ll remember that feeling for quite some time.”\n\nAsked if he enjoyed this goal the most, Carrick said late winners in front of the Stretford End are “what you get greedy for; you want more of that feeling.”\n\nHe continued: “For Ben to get that I think that’ll do him so much good. The response when he came into the changing room at the end, we’re all pleased for him.”\n\nDescribing today’s game, Carrick said: “The last goal was a big, big moment and the celebrations were big.\n\n“That’s what the game does to us and that’s why we’re in it and we love it. I think the disappointment to then the elation, and seeing everyone in that moment with the subs running down the touch line and jumping on Ben, the staff, the supporters – it’s special they’re the [moments] that we want more of.”\n\nCarrick refused to get carried away but made the exciting claim that “there’s a lot more to come from us in in different aspects of the game.”\n\nHe explained: “we’ve been together three weeks and we’re working on things and trying to improve things. Today was about getting through it in what way we needed to do and finding a way.\n\n“That’s three in a row, that’s good [but] we want more for sure. Hopefully we can win games a little bit more comfortably, but when they do come like that, it feels like more than just a win and that feeling spreads through so many people.\n\n“It’s got to be exciting. We want people to come with that passion, looking for something to happen and to be excited by it. We didn’t envision it happening just like that, but the supporters have come, gone home happy and are looking forward to the next one.”\n\nFeatured image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "TUC urges ministers to bring forward changes to protect workers amid concerns over apps such as Temper\n\nThe fashion retailer Urban Outfitters, the bed specialist Dreams and the operator of several Royal Parks cafes have been criticised for the use of the gig economy app Temper to take on staff – some of whom can end up earning below minimum wage.\n\nThe TUC is urging the government to bring forward promised reforms to protect gig economy workers amid concerns that those hired by apps such as Temper are missing out on significant employment rights including sick pay, rest breaks, holiday pay and a minimum hourly rate.\n\nIt suggested that such apps are leading to bogus self-employed roles. “We find it hard to see how roles like shop assistant can be self-employed,” the trade union body said.\n\nA year ago a number of major high street chains including Lush and Uniqlo stopped using apps such as Temper and the now defunct YoungOnes to take on freelancers, after outrage over the spread of gig economy working into the retail sector.\n\nLast week Outernet, the central London music and digital art venue – which was advertising for £13-an-hour temporary “cloakroom hosts” on Temper – said it had removed jobs from the site after being contacted by the Guardian. “This was the first time we used this site and we won’t be again,” a spokesperson said.\n\nThe continued use of Temper by retailers and coffee shops indicates that freelancing continues to spread beyond delivery workers, such as Deliveroo riders, to store staff, baristas and warehouse workers.\n\nCharges imposed by Temper to guarantee swift payment – taken up by 80% of users according to the app – mean than some workers can receive less than the legal minimum wage for those aged 21 and over of £12.21 an hour. Freelance workers are not guaranteed the minimum wage, unlike employees.\n\nIn recent weeks, Urban Outfitters has been advertising a number of posts paying £12.50 an hour – including a stock assistant to help with the annual stock take in Exeter and sales assistants in Gateshead and Birmingham. The latter location has 70 reviews, suggesting it is a regular user of the service.\n\nWorkers who take up the Urban Outfitter roles and wish to be paid in fewer than 14 days must pay the 2.9% fee, taking their hourly rate down to £12.14, 7p an hour below the legal minimum wage for those aged 21 and over.\n\nIt was a similar story at Colicci Cafe, a family-owned business that runs cafes in London’s Royal Parks including Richmond Park, wherewas offering as low as £12.50 an hour for barista shifts in recent weeks. Anyone not wishing to wait up to 30 days for payment would have to pay the Temper fee, taking their hourly rate below the legal minimum for most workers.\n\nUrban Outfitters and Colicci did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDreams has advertised a number of posts in recent weeks including two paying £12.71 an hour, one of which involves helping delivery drivers with loading and unloading deliveries to customers’ homes and another for receiving and dispatching deliveries in its warehouse until 11pm. It has also offered a delivery driver post at £15.14.\n\nHowever, those who do not wish to wait for up to 60 days to be paid must pay the 2.9% fee to Temper – reducing their pay to £12.35 and £13.68 an hour – as they must pay the fee to Temper in order to be paid shortly after their shift instead.\n\nTemper has a “Free Security” insurance scheme that covers sick pay, but this falls short of protections workers would be entitled to if they were employed. Temper workers must have worked through the app at least 10 times within the previous three months to receive sick pay, and will only receive such payments after being off for more than two weeks.\n\nStatutory sick pay for employees currently kicks in after three days and from day one from April under new rights guaranteed in the Employment Rights Act.\n\nPaul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC, said: “Cynical bosses should not be able to exploit gaps in the law to deny workers proper pay and conditions. The historic Employment Rights Act will bring welcome new protections. But without action on bogus self-employment, bad employers will make greater use of legal loopholes and talent platforms to deny workers their rights.”\n\nTemper, which claims it is gaining 1,000 new sign-ups a week through word of mouth, said in a statement: “We fully refute the comment that Temper constitutes ‘bogus’ self-employment.”\n\nIt said workers who signed up to its site could enjoy better protections than those on zero-hours contracts, including compensation of half what they would have earned on a shift if it is cancelled with less than 48 hours’ notice.\n\n“Everyone who works via Temper is doing so on a self-employed basis, and this is made clear at sign-up and throughout the app (to both individuals and companies). It’s also the reality of how the platform operates, and people working via Temper: choose which shifts to apply for (or not), negotiate pay, are free to work for multiple clients and platforms and have the right to arrange a substitute to complete a shift.\n\n“We are committed to remaining fully compliant with UK employment law. If there are any changes to worker status definitions in the future, we will, of course, adapt our platform and model to remain fully compliant.\n\n“Many people value the flexibility of freelance work, and the challenge for policymakers is to balance flexibility with fairness.”\n\nTemper said it set a “floor” of £12.50 an hour, before fees, for hiring workers via its app and this would rise to £13 for all shifts from 1 February. It said applicants were free to negotiate on rates if they believed they were too low and could be taken on full time without any fees.",

    "description": "ChatGPT is sunsetting GPT-4o, the AI model that many users became attached to last year for its friendly and at times sycophantic style.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI is sending everyone's favourite \"yes man\" version of ChatGPT back into retirement.\n\nIn a blog post on Thursday, the company said it would sunset GPT-4o alongside GPT‑4.1, GPT‑4.1 mini, and OpenAI o4-mini on February 13.\n\nOpenAI gave GPT-4o a special mention in its announcement after many users became attached to its \"conversational style and warmth\" last year, which prompted the company to reinstate it following user backlash in August.\n\nNow OpenAI says its latest models, GPT-5.1 and GPT-5.2, have \"improvements to personality,\" including the option to customize the chatbots' tone with styles like \"friendly.\"\n\n\"We're announcing the upcoming retirement of GPT‑4o today because these improvements are now in place, and because the vast majority of usage has shifted to GPT‑5.2, with only 0.1% of users still choosing GPT‑4o each day,\" OpenAI said in its blog post.\n\nEach model has different strengths, and users can select the version best-suited to their needs from a dropdown menu in ChatGPT.\n\nOpenAI first released GPT-4o in May 2024. The company rolled back an update in April 2025 that it said was \"overly flattering\" and \"often described as sycophantic.\"\n\nSome users had become attached to GPT-4o's style, though. Within 24 hours of OpenAI retiring the model with the launch of GPT-5 in August, the company reversed its decision for some paying users due to a wave of requests.\n\nSam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said that same month that there was a \"heartbreaking\" reason people had asked for GPT-4o back — because some said they had never had anyone support them before.\n\nThe model was known for responding to mundane prompts with gushing praise, using phrases like \"absolutely brilliant\" and \"you are doing heroic work.\"\n\nOpenAI said in its Thursday blog that it was making \"improvements in personality and creativity, as well as addressing unnecessary refusals and overly cautious or preachy responses,\" and that it was continuing to make progress toward a version of ChatGPT for adults over 18.\n\n\"We know that losing access to GPT‑4o will feel frustrating for some users, and we didn't make this decision lightly,\" OpenAI said in the blog post. \"Retiring models is never easy, but it allows us to focus on improving the models most people use today.\"",

    "title": "33 of the best and worst looks Melania Trump has worn as first lady",
    "description": "Melania Trump's best looks as first lady balance professional style and chicness, but she has also worn some controversial outfits.",
    "fullText": "Ralph Lauren Collection designed the knee-length, powder-blue dress Melania wore to Trump's inauguration in 2017, along with the coordinating shrug and gloves.\n\nShe accessorized the outfit with pearl earrings and blue, pointed-toe heels.\n\nThe full ensemble evoked Jackie Kennedy's style. From the bright color to the nod to one of America's most iconic first ladies, Melania's look was the perfect choice for her husband's first inauguration.\n\nHervé Pierre custom-designed Melania's off-the-shoulder dress for the inaugural ball.\n\nThe cream dress had an A-line silhouette, a thigh-high slit on one side, and three-dimensional fabric that curved across the bodice. A thin red belt cinched at the waist for a pop of color.\n\nThe dress felt high-fashion, connecting the first lady to her past as a model as she stepped into a new role.\n\nIn August 2017, the Trumps visited Corpus Christi, Texas, following Hurricane Harvey to assess recovery efforts.\n\nThe pair wore casual attire, with Melania arriving in a white button-down, black jeans, and sneakers. She also added a black baseball hat to her look that said \"FLOTUS,\" first lady of the United States, on the front.\n\nMelania's outfit quickly became a source of social-media chatter. Some said her hat called attention to her in the wake of the natural disaster, while others praised her casual outfit.\n\nWhen greeting Justin and Sophie Grégoire Trudeau at the White House in October 2017, Melania wore a gray pinstripe suit instead of a dress.\n\nThe suit featured high-waisted pants, and she paired it with a white button-down and an untied black tie. The outfit was unexpected for a first lady, offering a fun style moment.\n\nMelania greeted President Macron of France and his wife, Brigitte, in a black minidress and black pumps at the White House.\n\nThe standout feature of her outfit was a Givenchy tuxedo cape, which added a flair of personality to the otherwise simple look.\n\nThe first lady changed into a silver Chanel dress for the dinner.\n\nMost of the form-fitting dress was covered in textured fabric, while the top of the bodice and bottom of the skirt were made of a sheer, black fabric adorned with silver embellishments.\n\nThe fabrics didn't blend well, making the dress look too busy. It would have been a better look without the sheer fabric.\n\nIn June 2018, Melania visited an immigration facility in McAllen, Texas, where children were living, wearing a green Zara jacket that said \"I really don't care, do u?\" on the back.\n\nCritics said the jacket was insensitive to wear for the visit, critiquing both the first lady and the president for the fashion faux pas.\n\nMelania's former aide, Stephanie Grisham, wrote in her book \"I'll Take Your Questions Now\" that the president yelled at Melania for wearing the jacket, though Trump and the first lady both said she wore it to send a message to the left-wing media.\n\nMelania wore a floor-length wrap dress from Ralph Lauren to celebrate Independence Day 2018.\n\nThe blue-and-white gingham dress was fun and festive for the holiday, but the oversize red belt tied at her waist overwhelmed the look.\n\nIf the first lady had swapped the bow for a thinner belt, her dress would have been more effective.\n\nMelania posed for photos in front of pyramids in Egypt wearing cream trousers, a white blouse, a black tie, and a sand-colored Ralph Lauren blazer. A white-and-black boater hat completed the look.\n\nThe outfit may have been innocuously stylish in a different venue, but some social-media users thought the outfit looked similar to one worn by \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" villain René Belloq during his visit to the pyramids in the film.\n\nIt wasn't the first time Melania faced criticism for one of her outfits on her visit to Africa. During her tour of the pyramids and the Great Sphinx, Melania told reporters, \"I wish people would focus on what I do, not what I wear,\" following backlash for wearing a white pith helmet.\n\n\"You know what? We just completed an amazing trip,\" she added. \"We went to Ghana, we went to Malawi, we went to Kenya, here we are in Egypt. I want to talk about my trip, not what I wear.\"\n\nDonald and Melania Trump arrived at the White House on the evening of December 27, holding hands as they walked across the lawn.\n\nWhile the president was in a suit, Melania wore a green jacket, light-brown pants, and matching shoes.\n\nThe pants might have been a better choice for a daytime look, as it was difficult for some to tell if the first lady was even wearing bottoms at first glance in the dark. The addition of sunglasses to her nighttime look was also an odd choice.\n\nMelania's outfit would have worked better during the day or with different pants.\n\nIn April 2019, the first lady was photographed at the White House in a black-and-white polka-dot dress designed by Alessandra Rich.\n\nThe high-neck dress was cinched at the waist with a black belt, coordinating with the dots on the dress, and it hit her mid-calf.\n\nMelania wore a cream coat over her shoulders and her signature sunglasses, adding glamour to the feminine look.\n\nDuring a visit to the UK, Melania attended a state dinner with the royal family in a Dior gown.\n\nA layer of semi-sheer fabric covered the gown's scooped neckline, forming points on the top of the bodice before transitioning into white fabric. The dress hugged her figure before flaring slightly at her waist.\n\nMelania wore white, elbow-length gloves with the dress. The look was fitting for dining with royalty.\n\nAhead of a dinner at Winfield House, where the American ambassador to the UK lives, Melania was photographed in a red Givenchy gown.\n\nMelania's floor-length dress was sleeveless and featured a built-in cape, a silhouette Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales, often favors.\n\nDuring another visit to the UK in December 2019, Melania stepped out in a high-neck, cape coat from Valentino. The coat was mustard yellow, and Melania paired it with a pink dress and coordinating pumps.\n\nThe jacket was a big statement in and of itself, so the look would have been more effective if the first lady had worn a more neutral color with it than bright pink.\n\nMelania's black Dior sundress was fairly simple. The midi-length dress featured a V-neckline and a white, dotted pattern.\n\nThe white lace belt from Alaïa and white Christian Louboutin pumps she wore with the dress made the look cohesive, and she also added sunglasses to the outfit.\n\nThe look balanced Melania's personal style and traditional first lady attire.\n\nMelania appeared alongside Trump in a hot-pink midi-dress from Jason Wu at the 2020 RNC.\n\nThe dress featured a boat neckline and a flared skirt, and two black bows sat on the waistline, which appeared to be cinched with elastic. Melania wore black pumps with the dress.\n\nThe bows on the dress could have been chic, but they looked a bit crumpled throughout the night, particularly because they sat atop the ruched waistline and contrasted so heavily with the pink fabric. The dress would have been a better fit if there had been just one or no bows on the waistline.\n\nMelania wore a cape dress to close out the RNC, choosing a neon-green piece from Valentino.\n\nThe ankle-length, high-neck dress was covered in vertical pleats and featured two swaths of fabric flowing out from her shoulders like a cape. She added a thin pink belt and pink pumps to the outfit.\n\nThe silhouette was beautiful, but the green color was an odd choice for the RNC. Vanity Fair reported that it allowed social-media users to easily make memes out of the outfit using green screen technology.\n\nIf she had worn the dress in a different color, Melania's look would have been a slam dunk.\n\nMelania oversaw the delivery of the 2020 White House Christmas tree in a gingham coat from Balenciaga.\n\nThe loose-fitting coat featured an off-center line of buttons, and the collar formed a scarf that wrapped around one of Melania's shoulders. Quarter-length sleeves showed off the first lady's black gloves, just as the knee-length hem spotlighted her black boots from Alaïa.\n\nThe look was effortlessly chic.\n\nWhen Trump left office in January 2021, Melania chose to wear an all-black outfit.\n\nShe paired a form-fitting Dolce & Gabbana dress with a cropped Chanel coat, gloves, Christian Louboutin pumps, and dark sunglasses.\n\nThe look seemed to nod to Jackie Kennedy, just as her first outfit as first lady did. However, the darker hues spoke to the more somber tone of the day for the Trumps.\n\nMelania also made headlines for changing into a beachy dress before arriving at Mar-a-Lago later in the day.\n\nRather than wearing another pastel look to mark the beginning of her husband's second term as president, Melania donned navy and white for the 2025 inauguration.\n\nAdam Lippes designed her coat, which she paired with a white scarf, navy pumps, and a custom boater-style hat from Eric Javits. Boater hats are typically worn in summer, but the wool piece Melania wore offered a winter version.\n\nAlthough the hat got some negative attention online as people compared it to the one the Hamburglar or V in \"V For Vendetta\" wore, Melania's inaugural outfit was a savvy choice. The look set a serious tone, blending professional style with Melania's personal taste.\n\nMelania also managed to pull attention from Trump with the look, which was a feat considering how many eyes he had on him throughout the day.\n\nTraditionally, Easter fashion calls for pastel tones and festive prints like gingham, allowing people to have fun with their outfits.\n\nHowever, Melania arrived at the 2025 Easter Egg Roll at the White House in a simple cream trench coat from Mackage and heels designed by Roger Vivier.\n\nThe subdued look was a shift from Melania's more colorful outfits for previous Easter celebrations at the White House. Likewise, Mackage, a brand founded and headquartered in Canada, was a surprising choice for the first lady, given the ongoing trade dispute between the US and its northern neighbor.\n\nMelania joined her husband at Pope Francis' funeral at St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City.\n\nShe wore a black coatdress designed by Dolce & Gabbana for the occasion, as well as lace gloves and a lace veil from the fashion house.\n\nWearing an Italian designer was fitting for the occasion since the Catholic Church is based in the country, though Melania also favors Dolce & Gabbana when she isn't in Italy.\n\nMelania chose a $3,900 Bottega Veneta dress for the show.\n\nThe dress had an asymmetrical neckline and gold detailing on the shoulder and waist. Melania paired the designer gown with silver and gold Christian Louboutin pumps.\n\nThe dress was pretty, but Melania's black and white looks for Trump's second term are starting to feel a bit repetitive. A pop of color could have made the dress stand out more.\n\nMelania appeared alongside Trump at the US Army's 250th anniversary parade in Washington, DC, wearing another suit from Adam Lippes.\n\nBoth her $2,490 jacket and $1,190 skirt were cream-colored, with a subtle navy pinstripe pattern. The double-breasted jacket and pencil skirt had a looser, relaxed fit.\n\nBlue Christian Louboutin heels completed the ensemble.\n\nOn September 4, Melania attended a meeting of the White House Task Force on Artificial Intelligence Education.\n\nShe wore a soft gray linen suit that featured white pinstripes. The jacket was oversized, and the pants were wide-legged. The first lady added structure to the look with a fitted white T-shirt and a white belt.\n\nStilettos completed the chic menswear look.\n\nOn September 16, the president and first lady arrived in the UK for a state visit. The following evening, they attended a state banquet with King Charles III, Queen Camilla, and other members of the royal family.\n\nMelania wore a bright yellow dress designed by Carolina Herrera to the dinner. The dress had an off-the-shoulder neckline, a column skirt, and a slit on the side. She added even more color to the ensemble with a wide, purple belt and bright green, dangly earrings.\n\nIt was nice to see Melania add some color to her wardrobe in 2025, but the bright hue and belt made the dress look a bit too casual for the event. The silhouette was pretty, but the first lady may have been better off wearing the gown in a more subdued color.\n\nOn September 23, Melania accompanied the president on a visit to the UN General Assembly, wearing a white blazer and tailored pants from Dolce & Gabbana.\n\nThe suit was a strong choice, as the contrast of the long blazer and cropped pants felt professional and chic, and the cream Christian Louboutin shoes she paired with the look were stylish, too.\n\nHowever, the camel-colored blouse from Max Mara that she wore with the suit was almost too close to Melania's skin tone. The look would have popped more with a different colored shirt.\n\nWhen the president and first lady passed out candy at the White House on Halloween, neither opted to wear a costume. Instead, Melania donned a wool coat from Marni, which nodded to the holiday with orange trim on the collar, pockets, and lining.\n\nShe wore the khaki-colored coat buttoned to the collar, and it cinched at her waist with a thick belt — one of her go-to silhouettes. She paired the coat with taupe Manolo Blahnik heels.\n\nWhile the orange aspects of the look had a subtle Halloween feel, the outfit just didn't feel festive enough for the holiday, especially when compared to the plethora of decorations covering the White House for the event. Melania would have made a stronger statement in a full orange coat or a black and orange look.\n\nOn November 18, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, dined at the White House during his visit to the US.\n\nMelania donned a $3,350 Elie Saab dress for the occasion. The deep-green dress featured a strapless neckline, and ruching on both the bodice and the skirt added texture. A slit broke up the floor-length skirt, and Melania completed the look with black heels and sparkly earrings.\n\nEvery bit of Melania's look seemed designed to welcome Crown Prince Mohammed. The dress was similar in color to Saudi Arabia's national flag, seeming to nod to the nation. Plus, in November 2024, Elie Saab marked 45 years of his brand with \"1001 Seasons of Elie Saab,\" a massive fashion show held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nMelania celebrated the end of 2025 at Trump's annual party at Mar-a-Lago wearing a sparkly, silver gown.\n\nDesigned by The New Arrivals, the $1,450 dress was sleeveless, with a scooped neckline, hugging Melania's figure as it flowed into a midi-length skirt. She paired the dress with bedazzled Christian Louboutin shoes and loose waves.\n\nThe look was festive and fitting for Florida weather, offering a refreshing change from her more subdued style.\n\nThe first lady attended the premiere of her documentary \"Melania\" in a Dolce & Gabbana skirt suit.\n\nBlack buttons lined the center of the jacket, which was cinched at Melania's waist with a black belt. The column skirt hid her mid-calf, spotlighting her black pumps.\n\nThe outfit might have been fine for any number of first lady engagements, but it felt too understated for the premiere of her film.\n\nA black gown with a professional flair may have been more appropriate for the occasion.",

    "fullText": "Parents, teachers and young people share their views on whether social media restrictions would work in the UK\n\nPressure is mounting on the UK government to introduce a ban on social media for under-16s, after a decisive vote in House of Lords in favour of Australian-style restrictions.\n\nPeers backed a Tory-led amendment to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill by 261 votes to 150, despite the government opposing the move. Ministers are already considering a ban as part of a consultation due to report by the summer and so the Lords amendment is unlikely to pass in the Commons. Starmer is also understood to want to wait until evidence from Australia’s ban, which came into force in December, has been assessed, though the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, has urged him to “just get on with it”.\n\nHere parents, teachers and young people share their views.\n\nLaura, a parent from East Dunbartonshire, says the scale of harmful content circulating on social media has left many families feeling powerless. Laura, whose children are nine and 11, supports proposals to restrict children’s access to social media platforms, arguing that current safeguards leave too much exposure to chance.\n\n“Concerns about what my children might see online keep me awake at night,” Laura says. While her own children do not have social media accounts, she says that does little to shield them. “They can see any and all content on their friends’ phones. That includes material which, in any other context, would be completely unacceptable for children.”\n\nLaura has become involved in local campaigning, helping to set up a parent WhatsApp group that later linked into the Smartphone Free Childhood movement. “This can’t be left to individual families,” she says. “It creates a postcode lottery and exacerbates inequalities.”\n\nRachel, a secondary school English teacher in Derbyshire, says the impact of social media on pupils’ emotional wellbeing and concentration is now impossible to ignore. After more than 15 years in the classroom, she believes attention spans among younger students have noticeably deteriorated.\n\n“I see the effect of social media and shrinking attention spans every day,” she says. “It’s getting worse and worse.”\n\nIn the classroom, sustaining focus has become increasingly difficult, with younger pupils struggling “to concentrate on anything for longer than a few minutes”, she says, adding that resilience is also lacking. “There’s a lot of giving up before you’ve even started.”\n\nRachel believes the use of social media has become entwined with children’s sense of identity. “It feels like it’s invaded their psyche,” she says.\n\nWhen she mentioned the possibility of restrictions on social media use to a year 7 class, she says the reaction was immediate and emotional. “There was uproar,” she recalls. “I actually thought a couple of them were going to cry.”\n\nJulia*, 20, says having a smartphone as a shy eight-year-old was helpful, but she believes an “overhaul” of social media is needed.\n\n“I’ve never really known a world without a smartphone,” she says. “I was an anxious child, and when I was about 11, I found I could be myself and make friends online. But that doesn’t really help in real-life situations. I think it was a short-term solution for loneliness and confidence.”\n\nFrom the age of 12 to 15, Julia, a student from Stirling, Scotland, says she “somehow found myself on the sexist side on Instagram” with the barrage of such content making her “terrified of making mistakes” and exacerbating her social anxiety.\n\n“It really messed with my sense of self-worth, and I felt I had to be perfect,” she says. “I felt like I had to prove myself, to outdo myself, because at the time, the belief I had was that everybody thought women were less funny or less smart. I only started to come out of that self-hating mindset when I started to make real-life friends at the age of 16 or 17.”\n\nBut she is unconvinced that the proposed social media ban for under-16s is the solution.\n\n“Rather than just focusing on the impact it has on children, there should be a social media overhaul that affects everyone, because in the long run, it would also improve the lives of young people.”\n\nTahnee, an occupational therapist based in Glasgow, says watching children’s lives move increasingly online has left her deeply uneasy. Originally from Australia, she has nieces and nephews in both the UK and Australia and says she has seen how social media can begin to dominate young people’s lives “from the age of 11 or 12, when the first phones arrive”.\n\nTahnee, who has an eight-year-old son, welcomed Australia’s decision to introduce restrictions on children’s social media use.\n\nBut feedback from friends and family back home suggests the reality has been more complicated. “Parents of younger children are really pleased,” she says. “Others were hopeful, but in reality the ban hasn’t been as effective as people hoped.” Enforcement, she adds, has been inconsistent.\n\nShe believes restrictions can nevertheless help parents hold boundaries that are otherwise difficult to maintain. “If your child is the only one in the class without a smartphone or social media, it’s incredibly hard,” she says. “But if it’s 20% or 30%, it suddenly feels much easier to say: actually, we’re not doing this right now.”\n\nAJ, 20, says they “understand the thinking” behind the proposed ban, but believe it is a flawed approach.\n\n“I think it’s a broad-brush solution to a more complex problem,” they say. “It’s been clear to me so far that this conversation is being led by people who did not grow up with this technology, and I am frustrated with the way young people – especially young adults who experienced online childhoods – are being talked about and at, and rarely talked to.”\n\nAJ, who lives in Devon, began using Tumblr from around the age of 12 until 15.\n\n“I still look back on it now as a positive experience,” AJ says. “At that time in my life, I really needed what social media provided me with. I’m autistic, and it’s the first place where I really saw or interacted with, or not even interacted with, but I saw autistic adults, that there’s an autistic community and an autistic movement. These are things that were really formative to me, and I would not have had access to anywhere in my ‘real life’.”\n\nThey are concerned that a blanket ban for under-16s would remove that outlet for some children although they can see how a proposed ban could be used as leverage to pressure social media platforms.\n\n“I absolutely believe that they’ll [the social media platforms] need to be pressured into doing the right thing,” they say.\n\nPhil, a 47-year-old data scientist from Bedfordshire with two children aged 14 and 11, is sceptical that a proposed ban on children using social media will achieve what it promises. While he has little sympathy for tech companies, he is unconvinced the policy tackles the real problem.\n\nIn principle, Phil understands why governments want to intervene. In practice, he says, enforcement would be very difficult. “Existing parental controls can be complex and don’t always work as expected,” he says. “Kids can just download a VPN anyway,” he says, arguing this makes the UK’s Online Safety Act “fundamentally flawed”.\n\nPhil describes himself as “pretty techie” and says he has managed to limit what his children access on their own phones. But he stresses that this only goes so far. He recalls his son being shown a graphic video of the Charlie Kirk shooting by another child at school. “Someone just put it in front of his face,” Phil says. “You can’t control that.”",

    "fullText": "Silver is making a major run higher amid tightening export controls in China and meme-stock-style buying by Main Street investors hoping to squeeze bearish bets.\n\nThe precious metal is up an eye-popping 249% over the past year, including a 47% year-to-date jump, but not everyone thinks silver prices are destined to keep climbing.\n\n2021: -11.55%\n\nFormer JPMorgan strategist Marko Kolanovic and famous Wall Street trader Peter Brandt both sounded alarms on silver in separate posts on X (the former Twitter) this week.\n\nThe stakes are high for investors, given that silver has gone parabolic, surging in a straight line, sparking animal spirits among those hoping to reap even bigger gains.\n\nNew buyers, however, should remember that precious metals are notorious for boom-and-bust moves, making new positions riskier now than they were months ago.\n\nOn Jan. 1, China designated silver as a strategic resource, alongside rare earth minerals. The move restricts silver exports, requiring licenses that have become harder to get. Only 44 companies qualified for silver export licenses as China seeks to guarantee supply for next-gen solar, EVs, and electronics technologies.\n\nThe move accelerated a rally that emerged last year, driven by bullishness over industrial demand for high-tech applications and, more generally, by rising interest among investors eager to diversify portfolios by owning silver ETFs, such as the iShares Silver Trust (SLV), or physical silver, such as coins and bars.\n\nThe numbers are truly massive. Silver's move has lifted the market's size above $6 trillion. Putting that figure into perspective, Nvidia, Apple, and Alphabet boast market caps of $4.5 trillion, $3.75 trillion, and $4 trillion, respectively.\n\nMarket uncertainty resets silver, gold bets\n\nBillionaire Dalio sends 2-word warning on markets\n\nEvery major analyst’s gold price forecast for 2026\n\nEveryone wants in on the action.\n\nOn January 26, the iShares Silver Trust exchange-traded fund saw turnover of nearly $40 billion, according to Bloomberg, a figure similar to that of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), the go-to ETF for the 500 most influential publicly traded companies. That's nearly 20x higher than it had been averaging for most of last year.\n\nMoves like this aren't common, and they're often warning shots to which investors ought to pay attention. I've been tracking markets for more than 30 years, and I've seen more than my fair share of jaw-dropping pops that eventually turned into drops.",

    "fullText": "Balancing affordable and chic has always been a challenge when it comes to fashion.\n\nTarget has, at times, offered clothes that delivered both fashion appeal and affordability. Fast fashion chains have done that as well, but have often sacrificed quality and durability for price.\n\nLongtime Vogue Editor Anna Wintour understands that clothes have to sell.\n\n\"Fashion is not just creativity, it’s commerce,” Pure Luxy reported.\n\nDiscount retailers like Marshalls and TJMaxx have been able to build a massive following around offering treasure-hunt, bargain fashion. There's no stigma associated with shopping at those stores because they sell top-tier brands, which savvy shoppers can find at excellent prices.\n\nAffordables Apparel, which also owned the Aiden Lanes brand, managed to straddle that line for decades, but that has ended, as the chain has closed all locations under both brands.\n\nWhile many retailers close with great fanfare or a Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing, others go out more quietly. That's what happened with Affordable Apparel and Aiden Lanes, which have been quietly closing stores over the past few years.\n\nIn this case, the chain only made local announcements, and some local directory websites even show stores as still operating. A post on the Affordable Apparel and Aiden Lanes website, however, makes the fate of the two brands clear.\n\n\"We have permanently closed our stores. We are deeply grateful to our customers, partners, and community for their support over the years,\" the company posted.\n\nThe shutdown comes after a recent attempt to rebrand many of its stores.\n\n\"With the 2025 rebrand from Affordables Apparel to Aiden Lane, the brand is more aligned than ever with its 56-year mission of bringing everyday style to local women —whether they’re dressing for brunch, the office, or elevating their casual lifestyle,\" Charleston Living reported.\n\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\n\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\n\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\n\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\n\nThe chain was attempting to expand its selection to embrace a younger generation while remaining true to its loyal customers.\n\n“We’ve been focusing on setting the tone, the pace, and what people experience when they walk in the door. I hope that women of all ages leave with something they love; that's always been my passion,\" Company Buyer Nora Innis told the magazine.\n\nFounded in 1969 as a women’s apparel and accessories boutique in South Carolina, focused on affordable, classic pieces for women of all ages.\n\nBuilt a multi-location regional presence across South Carolina over several decades, including in cities like Mount Pleasant, Ladson, Summerville, Aiken, Hilton Head Island, and North Charleston.\n\nKnown for personalized, friendly service and curated merchandise, often described as a place where shoppers feel like they’re shopping with friends.\n\nAcquired by Lyndon and Melanie Amick (Lyndon is a former NASCAR driver) in 2012.\n\nExpansion included Aiden Lane boutiques, a name introduced with the first Aiden Lane store opening in 2017 and later rebranding some Affordables Apparel locations to Aiden Lane.\n\nThe brand’s evolution reflects a blend of heritage boutique tradition with fresh styling and modern retail experiences, maintaining relevance in a competitive retail environment.\n\nFinal Affordables Apparel location closes in January 2026.\n Sources: Post & Courier, Charleston Living Magazine",

    "fullText": "Colorado football coach Deion Sanders has laid out an NFL-style system of fines for his players if they violate team rules, including $500 for being late to practice.\n\nHe showed it on the video screen in his first team meeting of 2026 on Jan. 23, as briefly seen in a video posted by his oldest son, Deion Jr. Here is what it said:\n\nLate to meeting or film session: $400\n\nNo-show to meeting or film session: $2,000\n\nLate to strength and conditioning workout: $1,000\n\nNo-show to strength and conditioning workout: $1,500\n\nViolation of team rules: $1,000-$2,500 based on severity.\n\nPublic or social media misconduct: $2,000-$5,000\n\nDamage to university or team property: repair cost +$3,000\n\nLoss of team technology or equipment: replacement cost +$1,000\n\nPlayers also are required to wear Nike shoes and apparel while representing the university at practices, games and organized team activities. Colorado has been a Nike-sponsored school since 1995. Sanders also is sponsored by Nike. Failure to comply also could result in disciplinary action.\n\nThere is an appeal process for players, with final decisions issued within five business days. But it's another example of the professionalization of college sports, with players this year getting paid directly by schools for use of their name, image and likeness (NIL).\n\nA lack of discipline also apparently was an issue for Colorado last year, when the Buffaloes finished 3-9 during Sanders’ third season in charge.\n\n“All these lates and tardies and all these things, we can’t have that this year,” Colorado receivers coach Jason Phillips told the team. “Those are the things we will eliminate… Two ways to eliminate that. Either you change, or we change you.”\n\nSanders has brought in 42 new scholarship transfer players this year, offsetting more than 35 scholarship players who transferred out.\n\n“You all are hand-picked, hand-picked, hand-picked,” Sanders told the team. “We watched darn near every one of y’all.”\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.
