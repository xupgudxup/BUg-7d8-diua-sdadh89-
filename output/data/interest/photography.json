    "description": "DJI may have fixed it now.",
    "fullText": "The immediate threat may be fixed, but this raises serious questions.\n\nThe immediate threat may be fixed, but this raises serious questions.\n\nSammy Azdoufal claims he wasn’t trying to hack every robot vacuum in the world. He just wanted to remote control his brand-new DJI Romo vacuum with a PS5 gamepad, he tells The Verge, because it sounded fun.\n\nBut when his homegrown remote control app started talking to DJI’s servers, it wasn’t just one vacuum cleaner that replied. Roughly 7,000 of them, all around the world, began treating Azdoufal like their boss.\n\nHe could remotely control them, and look and listen through their live camera feeds, he tells me, saying he tested that out with a friend. He could watch them map out each room of a house, generating a complete 2D floor plan. He could use any robot’s IP address to find its rough location.\n\n“I found my device was just one in an ocean of devices,” he says.\n\nOn Tuesday, when he showed me his level of access in a live demo, I couldn’t believe my eyes. Ten, hundreds, thousands of robots reporting for duty, each phoning home MQTT data packets every three seconds to say: their serial number, which rooms they’re cleaning, what they’ve seen, how far they’ve traveled, when they’re returning to the charger, and the obstacles they encountered along the way.\n\nI watched each of these robots slowly pop into existence on a map of the world. Nine minutes after we began, Azdoufal’s laptop had already cataloged 6,700 DJI devices across 24 different countries and collected over 100,000 of their messages. If you add the company’s DJI Power portable power stations, which also phone home to these same servers, Azdoufal had access to over 10,000 devices.\n\nWhen I say I couldn’t believe my eyes at first, I mean that literally. Azdoufal leads AI strategy at a vacation rental home company; when he told me he reverse engineered DJI’s protocols using Claude Code, I had to wonder whether AI was hallucinating these robots. So I asked my colleague Thomas Ricker, who just finished reviewing the DJI Romo, to pass us its serial number.\n\nWith nothing more than that 14-digit number, Azdoufal could not only pull up our robot, he could correctly see it was cleaning the living room and had 80 percent battery life remaining. Within minutes, I watched the robot generate and transmit an accurate floor plan of my colleague’s house, with the correct shape and size of each room, just by typing some digits into a laptop located in a different country.\n\nSeparately, Azdoufal pulled up his own DJI Romo’s live video feed, completely bypassing its security PIN, then walked into his living room and waved to the camera while I watched. He also says he shared a limited read-only version of his app with Gonzague Dambricourt, CTO at an IT consulting firm in France; Dambricourt tells me the app let him remotely watch his own DJI Romo’s camera feed before he even paired it.\n\nAzdoufal was able to enable all of this without hacking into DJI’s servers, he claims. “I didn’t infringe any rules, I didn’t bypass, I didn’t crack, brute force, whatever.” He says he simply extracted his own DJI Romo’s private token — the key that tells DJI’s servers that you should have access to your own data — and those servers gave him the data of thousands of other people as well. He shows me that he can access DJI’s pre-production server, as well as the live servers for the US, China, and the EU. (He says his tool wipes the data each time he closes it.)\n\nHere’s the good news: On Tuesday, Azdoufal was not able to take our DJI Romo on a joyride through my colleague’s house, see through its camera, or listen through its microphone. DJI had already restricted that form of access after both Azdoufal and I told the company about the vulnerabilities.\n\nAnd by Wednesday morning, Azdoufal’s scanner no longer had access to any robots, not even his own. It appears that DJI has plugged the gaping hole.\n\nBut this incident raises serious questions about DJI’s security and data practices. It will no doubt be used to help retroactively justify fears that led to the Chinese dronemaker getting largely forced out of the US. If Azdoufal could find these robots without even looking for them, will it protect them against people with intent to do harm? If Claude Code can spit out an app that lets you see into someone’s house, what keeps a DJI employee from doing so? And should a robot vacuum cleaner have a microphone? “It’s so weird to have a microphone on a freaking vacuum,” says Azdoufal.\n\nIt doesn’t help that when Azdoufal and The Verge contacted DJI about the issue, the company claimed it had fixed the vulnerability when it was actually only partially resolved.\n\n“DJI can confirm the issue was resolved last week and remediation was already underway prior to public disclosure,” reads part of the original statement provided by DJI spokesperson Daisy Kong. We received that statement on Tuesday morning at 12:28PM ET — about half an hour before Azdoufal showed me thousands of robots, including our review unit, reporting for duty.\n\nTo be clear, it’s not surprising that a robot vacuum cleaner with a smartphone app would phone home to the cloud. For better or for worse, users currently expect those apps to work outside of their own homes. Unless you’ve built a tunnel into your own home network, that means relaying the data through cloud servers first.\n\nBut people who put a camera into their home expect that data to be protected, both in transit and once it reaches the server. Security professionals should know that — but as soon as Azdoufal connected to DJI’s MQTT servers, everything was visible in cleartext. If DJI has merely cut off one particular way into those servers, that may not be enough to protect them if hackers find another way in.\n\nUnfortunately, DJI is far from the only smart home company that’s let people down on security. Hackers took over Ecovacs robot vacuums to chase pets and yell racist slurs in 2024. In 2025, South Korean government agencies reported that Dreame’s X50 Ultra had a flaw that could let hackers view its camera feed in real time, and that another Ecovacs and a Narwal robovac could let hackers view and steal photos from the devices. (Korea’s own Samsung and LG vacuums received high marks, and a Roborock did fine.)\n\nIt’s not just vacuums, of course. I still won’t buy a Wyze camera, despite its new security ideas, because that company tried to sweep a remote access vulnerability under the rug instead of warning its customers. I would find it hard to trust Anker’s Eufy after it lied to us about its security, too. But Anker came clean, and sunlight is a good disinfectant.\n\nDJI is not being exceptionally transparent about what happened here, but it did answer almost all our questions. In a new statement to The Verge via spokesperson Daisy Kong, the company now admits “a backend permission validation issue” that could have theoretically let hackers see live video from its vacuums, and it admits that it didn’t fully patch that issue until after we confirmed that issues were still present.\n\nDJI identified a vulnerability affecting DJI Home through internal review in late January and initiated remediation immediately. The issue was addressed through two updates, with an initial patch deployed on February 8 and a follow-up update completed on February 10. The fix was deployed automatically, and no user action is required.\n\nThe vulnerability involved a backend permission validation issue affecting MQTT-based communication between the device and the server. While this issue created a theoretical potential for unauthorized access to live video of ROMO device, our investigation confirms that actual occurrences were extremely rare. Nearly all identified activity was linked to independent security researchers testing their own devices for reporting purposes, with only a handful of potential exceptions.\n\nThe first patch addressed this vulnerability but had not been applied universally across all service nodes. The second patch re-enabled and restarted the remaining service nodes. This has now been fully resolved, and there is no evidence of broader impact. This was not a transmission encryption issue. ROMO device-to-server communication was not transmitted in cleartext and has always been encrypted using TLS. Data associated with ROMO devices, such as those in Europe, is stored on U.S.-based AWS cloud infrastructure.\n\nDJI maintains strong standards for data privacy and security and has established processes for identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities. The company has invested in industry-standard encryption and operates a longstanding bug bounty program. We have reviewed the findings and recommendations shared by the independent security researchers who contacted us through that program as part of our standard post-remediation process. DJI will continue to implement additional security enhancements as part of its ongoing efforts.\n\nAzdoufal says that even now, DJI hasn’t fixed all the vulnerabilities he’s found. One of them is the ability to view your own DJI Romo video stream without needing its security pin. Another one is so bad I won’t describe it until DJI has more time to fix it. As of February 17th, DJI tells The Verge it will do so within weeks.\n\nAnd both Azdoufal and security researcher Kevin Finisterre tell me it’s not enough for the Romo to send encrypted data to a US server, if anyone inside that server can easily read it afterward. “A server being based in the US in no way, shape, or form prevents .cn DJI employees from access,” Finisterre tells me. That seems evident, as Azdoufal lives in Barcelona and was able to see devices in entirely different regions.\n\n“Once you’re an authenticated client on the MQTT broker, if there are no proper topic-level access controls (ACLs), you can g., #) and see all messages from all devices in plaintext at the application layer,” says Azdoufal. “TLS does nothing to prevent this — it only protects the pipe, not what’s inside the pipe from other authorized participants.”\n\nWhen I tell Azdoufal that some may judge him for not giving DJI much time to resolve the issues before going public, he notes that he didn’t hack anything, didn’t expose sensitive data, and isn’t a security professional. He says he was simply livetweeting everything that happened while trying to control his robot with a PS5 gamepad.\n\n“Yes, I don’t follow the rules, but people stick to the bug bounty program for money. I fucking don’t care, I just want this fixed,” he says. “Following the rules to the end would probably make this breach happen for a way longer time, I think.”\n\nHe doesn’t believe that DJI truly discovered these issues by itself back in January, and he’s annoyed the company only ever responded to him robotically in DMs on X, instead of answering his emails.\n\nBut he is happy about one thing: He can indeed control his Romo with a PlayStation or Xbox gamepad.\n\nUpdate, February 17th: Added that DJI has committed to address the other vulnerability within a matter of weeks.",

    "fullText": "If you own a GMC truck in Houston, this story may hit close to home.\n\nA River Oaks resident says he did everything right. His truck was parked in his driveway. The area was well-lit. A surveillance camera with a spotlight pointed directly at the vehicle. It was not tucked away in a dark corner of the street. It was sitting right outside his home, in plain view.\n\nAccording to a report aired by FOX 26 Houston, the theft happened around 3:30 a.m. The owner had no idea until hours later. He woke up Friday morning around 6:30 and began getting ready for work. At about 8 a.m., he walked into the driveway, just like he does every day. He pressed the unlock button on his key fob and looked up.\n\n“I was honestly just in complete shock,” he told reporter Jillian Hartmann.\n\nEvery car is special, but this one is particularly special to its owner. He described it as his first major purchase. Something he worked hard for. Something he had paid off. In a matter of minutes, it was taken.\n\nThe brazen nature of the theft makes this case especially unsettling. The homeowner says he has a driveway camera aimed directly at where the truck was parked. After realizing the vehicle was missing, he checked the footage on his phone.\n\nSure enough, the recording showed the theft unfolding in the early morning hours.\n\nThe suspects appeared unfazed by the cameras. The driveway was fully illuminated. A spotlight from the camera lit up the scene. Yet the thieves carried on without hesitation. The victim believes they were professionals. He said the theft took very little time.\n\nEven more concerning is the apparent targeting.\n\nThe homeowner noted there are more than 100 vehicles parked along his street overnight. Despite that, the suspects specifically chose his GMC truck. It was not hidden. It was not isolated. It was not easier to access compared to other cars parked on the street. And still, it was the one they took.\n\nThe victim later saw a previous FOX 26 report detailing a rise in GMC truck thefts across the Houston area. That is when it clicked.\n\n“I had no idea I had a sitting duck in my driveway,” he said.\n\nHis shock didn’t come from just losing the truck. It was more about how easy the operation looked. He acknowledged that car theft is common in Houston, but like many owners, he never expected it to happen to him.\n\nThere is a particular sting to walking outside and seeing an empty parking space where your vehicle once sat. No broken glass. No loud alarm woke the neighborhood. Just silence and an empty driveway. It hits the kind of different that only people unfortunate enough to have experienced it can truly understand.\n\nThe resident says he is speaking out to raise awareness within the GMC truck community. His warning is simple. If you own one, pay attention. Extra lighting and visible cameras may not be enough deterrent.\n\nHouston police are investigating the case. Authorities are urging anyone with information to contact HPD.\n\nFor truck owners, this incident underscores a growing concern. High-demand vehicles often become high-priority targets.\n\nAnd targeting comes in different shades.\n\nWe recently ran the story of a North Georgia dealership salesman who allegedly targeted and sold a $90k pickup to an elderly man with dementia. He even traveled 40 miles to the man’s home and then drove him back to the dealership to close the deal.\n\nProfessional theft crews can move quickly, sometimes in under a minute, using increasingly sophisticated methods. In many cases, by the time the owner realizes something is wrong, the vehicle is already far from the neighborhood where it was parked.\n\nFor this River Oaks resident, the experience has been a harsh wake-up call. What felt secure one night turned out to be anything but. And for GMC owners across Houston, his story is a reminder that convenience and familiarity can sometimes create a false sense of safety.\n\nThe driveway may feel like the safest place to park. In this case, it was not.\n\nEditorial Note: Video playback may be limited on some platforms.

    "fullText": "Nostalgia is everywhere on the internet right now.\n\nWith doomsayers predicting that AI could bring about the apocalypse, this January marking the highest number of layoffs to kick off a year since 2009, and ongoing political unrest, people are harking back to simpler times.\n\nRather than looking forward to the year ahead, many people hailed in 2026 by reminiscing about 2016 — posting throwback pictures and declaring that 2026 will be the new 2016, set to songs released around that time, such as Zara Larsson's \"Lush Life.\"\n\nMany have thrown it back even further — think pieces and experts have dubbed 2026 the \"year of analog.\" This trend is less about trying to live like it's 2016, but more 2006 — or 1996.\n\nThe tech-induced nostalgia is shining through in recent Reddit posts that ask: \"What is a luxury item from 20 years ago that is basically worthless trash today?\"\n\nThis question has been posted on Reddit in several threads over the last few months. These threads have amassed thousands of comments in the past few weeks.\n\nAmong the items people are discussing are portable GPS devices, digital cameras, iPods, and paying for novelty ringtones.\n\n\"I paid $700 for one of those in... 2003?\" one Reddit user says of a portable GPS device. \"Best purchase ever because I'm directionally challenged and relied on MapQuest (!) printouts on the passenger seat.\"\n\n\"Ringtones. Oh you want one of your ringtones to be a 5 seconds snippets from Lose yourself. That'll be 8.50$. People would flex about their ringtones,\" another Redditor wrote.\n\nIn another post, a Redditor reminisced about USB storage drives.\n\n\"I remember in 5th grade, a flash drive was on our required supplies list, and I got one that was 512mb. A teacher told me that was more than I would need for the rest of my life,\" they wrote.\n\nThe PalmPilot, BlackBerry, plasma TVs, and SD cards have also gotten repeat mentions.\n\nSome of these pieces of tech — namely the digital camera — have been reborn in recent years as status symbols for a generation craving a time that felt more authentic.\n\nAs part of the push to get offline, many Gen Z and millennials are rejecting new technology by Bricking their phones — blocking certain apps and websites — and leaning into in-person hobbies.\n\nKathryn Jezer-Morton recently wrote for The Cut that 2026 is all about \"friction-maxxing\" — a rejection of the numbing convenience that AI and technology bring us, which Jezer-Morton says is distancing us from life itself.\n\nIt's as if consumers are harking back to a time when it felt as though technology was made to work for us, rather than make our lives more complicated.\n\n\"After a period of intense euphoria and excitement with regards to AI, we are coming down on the other side of the hill,\" Thomas Roulet, a professor of organizational sociology and leadership at the University of Cambridge, told Business Insider.\n\n\"The tool is democratised and has become normalised, and people realise it hasn't made their work easier or less intense — quite the opposite,\" he added.\n\n\"So it's normal to find GenZ employees — who will have to go through their entire career using those tools — to be disillusioned,\" he said.\n\nWhen the future of AI is being predicted by some tech execs and experts as a white-collar bloodbath with millions of workers laid off, or that those living without AI glasses could be at a \"cognitive disadvantage,\" it's no wonder.\n\nIn an uncertain time, one thing that's sure in 2026: de-digitalizing your life is officially a status symbol.",

The car slid down into the infield grass, coming to rest as the race concluded and confusion began to ripple through the grandstands and television broadcast.\n\nAt 5:16 p.m. ET, Earnhardt was pronounced dead at Halifax Medical Center. What began as a routine final-lap crash became the most consequential day in modern NASCAR history.\n\nThe cruelty of that afternoon was rooted in contrast. Michael Waltrip had just earned his first Cup Series victory after more than 400 starts, and Dale Jr. finished second, giving Dale Earnhardt Incorporated a stunning 1-2 result in the sport’s biggest race. It should have been a celebration that echoed across the garage for years.\n\nInstead, the emotional tone shifted in real time. Television coverage grew subdued. Drivers and crew members stood silently. The infield grass where the black No. 3 had come to rest became the focal point of an uneasy stillness. Although NASCAR had seen violent crashes before, this one carried a different gravity that became undeniable as time passed.\n\nEarnhardt had built a reputation for walking away from hard hits. His toughness was part of his legend, and many fans initially assumed he would once again climb from the car. The confirmation that followed hours later sent shockwaves far beyond Daytona Beach and permanently altered how the sport would approach safety.\n\nStatistics explain part of Earnhardt’s greatness, but they do not fully capture his presence. He won seven Cup Series championships, tying Richard Petty and Cale Yarborough. He earned 428 top-10 finishes, claimed 22 pole positions, and finally captured his long-awaited Daytona 500 victory in 1998 after years of near-misses on NASCAR’s biggest stage.\n\nWhat separated Earnhardt from other champions was the way he controlled a race without always leading it. Competitors adjusted their lines when he filled their mirrors. Fans reacted viscerally to his every move, either cheering him with loyalty or booing him with equal intensity. He embodied a version of NASCAR that was raw, competitive, and unapologetically physical.\n\nThe nickname “The Intimidator” was not a marketing invention; it was earned through decades of calculated aggression and racecraft. He understood drafting strategy at superspeedways better than most of his contemporaries and mastered the mental side of stock car racing. His influence extended beyond results and into the psychological fabric of the sport.\n\nEarnhardt’s death forced NASCAR into a reckoning that had been building quietly for years. Safety equipment and structural improvements that had once been optional or inconsistently adopted became mandatory across the Cup Series. The HANS device was required. SAFER barriers were installed at tracks nationwide. Six-point harness systems and enhanced seat construction became standard components rather than upgrades.\n\nThese changes reshaped the physical risk landscape of NASCAR competition. Since February 2001, there have been no driver fatalities in the Cup Series, a statistic that underscores how dramatically the sport evolved in response to that loss. The reforms were not cosmetic adjustments; they were structural transformations that altered car design, track engineering, and driver expectations.\n\nEvery modern NASCAR driver competes in a machine influenced by the lessons learned from Turn 4 in 2001. The safety advances implemented in the aftermath stand as a lasting legacy tied directly to that day.\n\nTwenty-five years later, the No. 3 remains one of the most recognizable numbers in racing. The black paint scheme and silver trim still carry emotional weight for longtime fans, while younger audiences understand its importance through history rather than firsthand experience. When NASCAR returns to Daytona each February, the memory of that final lap remains embedded in the narrative of the event.\n\nDale Earnhardt Jr. carried the family name into the modern era, becoming one of the sport’s most popular drivers while navigating the emotional complexity of racing at tracks so closely tied to his father’s legacy. The broader NASCAR community continues to reference Earnhardt’s competitive style and championship pedigree when debating the greatest drivers of all time.\n\nThe sport has evolved in technology, media exposure, and competitive structure, but Earnhardt’s shadow remains visible in each of those transitions. He represented a bridge between NASCAR’s regional roots and its national growth, helping to carry the sport into a new century before his life was cut short.\n\nThe 2001 Daytona 500 stands as both a tragic loss and a turning point. It marked the end of one era and accelerated the beginning of another defined by modern safety standards and heightened awareness of driver protection. NASCAR did not freeze in time after that day; it changed course.\n\nYet for all the innovation that followed, the memory of Dale Earnhardt continues to shape how fans and competitors interpret the sport’s identity. He was not simply one of its greatest champions; he was a defining figure whose presence extended beyond trophies and statistics. His career defined intensity, resilience, and a willingness to compete at the edge.\n\nTwenty-five years later, NASCAR still races forward, but it does so with a clear understanding of what was lost and what was learned. Dale Earnhardt’s legacy lives not only in record books, but in the safety systems, cultural memory, and competitive spirit that continue to define the sport today.",

    "fullText": "For a long while, digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras were the king of the castle for professional and amateur photography. They brought large sensors, interchangeable lenses, and professional-level viewfinders to the digital world at approachable prices, and then cemented their lead when they started being used to create video as well. They’re experiencing a bit of a decline now, though, as mirrorless cameras start to dominate, and with that comes some unique opportunities. To attach a lens meant for a DSLR to a mirrorless camera, an adapter housing must be used, and [Ancient] found a way to squeeze a computer and a programmable aperture into this tiny space.\n\nThe programmable aperture is based on an LCD screen from an old cell phone. LCD screens are generally transparent until their pixels are switched, and in most uses as displays a backer is put in place so someone can make out what is on the screen. [Ancient] is removing this backer, though, allowing the LCD to be completely transparent when switched off. The screen is placed inside this lens adapter housing in the middle of a PCB where a small computer is also placed. The computer controls the LCD via a set of buttons on the outside of the housing, allowing the photographer to use this screen as a programmable aperture.\n\nThe LCD-as-aperture has a number of interesting uses that would be impossible with a standard iris aperture. Not only can it function as a standard iris aperture, but it can do things like cycle through different areas of the image in sequence, open up arbitrary parts or close off others, and a number of other unique options. It’s worth checking out the video below, as [Ancient] demonstrates many of these effects towards the end. We’ve seen some of these effects before, although those were in lenses that were mechanically controlled instead.\n\nThanks to [kemfic] for the tip!",

    "fullText": "Many people bought the devices thinking they would do little more than protect their delivery packages\n\nWhat happens to the data that smart home cameras collect? Can law enforcement access this information – even when users aren’t aware officers may be viewing their footage? Two recent events have put these concerns in the spotlight.\n\nA Super Bowl ad by the doorbell-camera company Ring and the FBI’s pursuit of the kidnapper of Nancy Guthrie, the mother of Today show host Savannah Guthrie, have resurfaced longstanding concerns about surveillance against a backdrop of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. The fear is that home cameras’ video feeds could become yet another part of the government’s mass surveillance apparatus.\n\nRing’s Super Bowl ad appeared intended to inspire hope: a neighborhood harnessing the power of technology to find a lost dog: a distraught girl misses her pet, Milo, who has gone missing. Gone are the times of putting up “missing” posters. Simply posting Milo’s photo through the Ring app automatically alerts a host of nearby cameras to use AI to look for a match, the ad says. A neighbor then arrives on their porch with Milo, safe and sound. As they reunite, feel-good music plays. But the reference to the AI-powered feature Search Party, meant to mimic the activity of a real one, quickly triggered comparisons with a dystopian Black Mirror episode. Viewers wondered: if the company could quickly access hundreds of Ring cameras in a neighborhood to find a dog, what’s stopping it from targeting a person in the same way?\n\nIn Guthrie’s case, the FBI released a video Tuesday showing a masked person at her doorstep. But the footage appears to have been retrieved from a Google Nest camera that officials previously said was disconnected and lacking an active monthly subscription for premium features. Without a subscription, users cannot typically store footage. The publication of the footage from Guthrie’s home indicated that law enforcement could still access “residual data located in backend systems”, in the words of FBI director Kash Patel; cybersecurity experts have said this may be because doorbell cameras often have back-ups stored in a cloud. It’s currently unclear whether law enforcement used a warrant.\n\n“There’s a very distinct and marked difference between what you have access to – in terms of whether you’re paying for it or not – and what the company has access to,” said Chris Gilliard, a data privacy expert who has researched how wearables and smart doorbells are contributing to mass surveillance.\n\nNew images in the search for Nancy Guthrie:\n\nOver the last eight days, the FBI and Pima County Sheriff’s Department have been working closely with our private sector partners to continue to recover any images or video footage from Nancy Guthrie’s home that may have been lost,… pic.twitter.com/z5WLgPtZpT\n\nRing, owned by Amazon, and Nest say they comply with law enforcement requests for data, including footage, when it’s legally required and in instances where there’s a threat to someone’s life. Ring also says that federal law enforcement doesn’t have direct access to the data from the doorbell camera, telling Wirecutter in a statement that “Ring has no partnership with ICE, does not give ICE videos, feeds, or back-end access, and does not share video with them”. Ring has also said that the feature advertised as being able to find dogs can’t currently detect human biometrics. Nest has said in a transparency report that the company would not instantly hand over data to a federal agency with a search warrant. “We’d analyze the request to be sure the warrant wasn’t overly broad, then we’d make sure the information they requested was within the scope of the warrant,” the company stated.\n\nThere’s been a swift backlash, as people have become more aware of surveillance concerns tied to smart home devices. Many people bought these devices thinking they would do little more than protect their delivery packages. Lawmakers from across the aisle condemned Ring’s Super Bowl ad, with the US senator Ed Markey writing in an open letter on Wednesday that “it’s not hard to imagine the ways that Amazon – or law enforcement – could abuse this feature”. TikTok influencers called on people to “smash” their Ring doorbells, and Redditors shared tips on trying to get refunds on old Ring devices from Amazon. Graphics circulating on social media stated: “Your ring camera is an ICE agent.”\n\nRing appears to be feeling the heat. On Thursday, Amazon announced that Ring had cancelled its partnership with Flock Safety, which runs a network of automated license plate readers across the US. Flock says it does not give ICE or the Department of Homeland Security direct access to its systems, but news reports have documented an ongoing loophole: cases in which local law enforcement has used Flock’s tool in aiding federal immigration authorities.\n\nRing said in a blog post that the integration with Flock would “require significantly more time and resources than anticipated”. The company also stated that no customer videos had ever been sent to Flock, since the integration never launched, stressing a commitment to making neighborhoods safer.\n\nData-privacy advocates are not convinced by Ring’s commitment to community safety, though. “Ring is just trying to protect its bottom line,” said Jeramie D Scott, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center’s surveillance oversight program. Without additional federal protections, Scott worries Ring will continue to expand its surveillance capabilities despite the recent backtracking.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Ring has faced criticism over data protection. “Ring has a history of playing it pretty loose with people’s privacy rights,” said Beryl Lipton, senior investigative researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. In 2023, the Federal Trade Commission charged the company with “compromising its customers’ privacy by allowing any employee or contractor to access consumers’ private videos and by failing to implement basic privacy and security protections”. This, in turn, allowed hackers to “take control of consumers’ accounts, cameras, and videos”. Ring agreed to pay $5.8m in a settlement with the FTC.\n\nRing still has many partnerships with police, and with the return of its founder, Jamie Siminoff, who is now CEO, the company appears to be doubling down on its original emphasis on fighting crime. Siminoff said last year that his cameras can almost “zero-out crime”, though experts like Gilliard are skeptical. After Siminoff’s return, the company partnered with body-camera maker Axon to restart a tool that allows police to request footage through an online portal.\n\n“These companies – their typical strategy is to consistently push the envelope in small ways to acclimate us to more invasive uses of these things,” Gilliard said.",

    "fullText": "TAMPA, Fla. — As Gerrit Cole threw his first bullpen of spring training on Friday morning, a crowd of reporters made their best efforts to get a look through the mostly-covered fence that encaged the rehabbing righty.\n\nWhile those with cameras took turns sharing limited peepholes in order to snap a shot of Cole, who underwent Tommy John surgery last spring, the contingent that stood behind him enjoyed an unimpeded view. The group included manager Aaron Boone, pitching coaches Matt Blake and Desi Druschel, bench coach Brad Ausmus and guest instructor Ron Guidry, who all watched Cole consistently reach the mid-90s as he simulated two innings of work.\n\nCole, who had already thrown some bullpens in New York and California over the offseason, saw his velocity hit at least 96 mph, and he threw his full arsenal to Austin Wells.\n\n“He looked like a Cy Young pitcher,” the catcher said of Cole, who won the award in 2023. “He looked smooth and in control. He looked confident in his ability.”\n\n“Was nice and easy,” Guidry chimed in.\n\nBoone agreed with those assessments, likening an in-command Cole to a “diver that dives off the high board and just goes in the water and makes no splash.”\n\n“He looked like Gerrit Cole,” the manager added.\n\nCole also came away pleased, calling his session “well executed” while noting that his reconstructed elbow “feels really good.”\n\n“It feels different than it has been in quite some time,” he continued. “Feel is subjective, so we’ll have to see how it plays out.”\n\nSo far, all has gone according to plan for the 35-year-old, who battled elbow inflammation in 2024 before tearing his ulnar collateral ligament around this time last year. But while Cole has looked sharp thus far, Boone made it clear that the Yankees won’t be rushing him back or pushing him harder than he needs to be.\n\nCole, meanwhile, reiterated that full Tommy John reconstruction comes with a 14-18-month timetable.\n\n“So it really hasn’t changed,” Cole said, meaning he’s looking at returning sometime in May, the earlier end of the spectrum, or June.\n\nEarlier this week, Boone said that Cole is scheduled to start facing live hitters in “a couple weeks” and could “potentially” get in games before spring training ends. Cole said the latter goal is realistic, but that isn’t set in stone.\n\nCole is doing his best to stay present, as he is still in the midst of what he said has been a “long and tedious” process. That said, he’s certainly longing for real games after sitting out the entire 2025 season.\n\n“I just miss playing,” he said. “I miss that outlet of working hard and feeling exhausted every five days.”\n\nWhenever Cole does return, the Yankees will be banking on him being the best version of himself.\n\nThe club didn’t add another frontline starter this offseason despite some others having injury and workload concerns, partly because they have Cole coming back. But Tommy John surgery can come with setbacks, rust and even prolonged struggles — look at how Atlanta’s Spencer Strider fared last year — which is why Cole doesn’t want to get ahead of himself.\n\n“I’m a confident guy,” Cole said. “I have high expectations for my execution internally, but overall, in terms of performance and expectations, I don’t really have any set goals or numbers or things like that. It’s been working really well to just stay day-to-day and execute the task at hand, so I think the challenge is to continue to do that as things become more exciting and as things start to get rolling more and more.”\n\nBoone, however, isn’t going to doubt that Cole can return to form.\n\n“I’m not going to put any ceiling on what Gerrit could do once he’s back and in the rotation,” the skipper said, noting the high success rate of Tommy John surgery.\n\nSome have wondered if Cole will return with new experiments that he concocted during his down time, but the cerebral pitcher said not much has changed, aside from him having more time to lift in the weight room. Cole didn’t reveal any new pitches, and he said that his mechanics remain mostly the same.\n\nThere is one exception, as he’s now starting his windup by bringing his hands over his head.\n\n“It feels good,” Cole said when asked about the tweak. “I generally just like the rhythm of it.”",
