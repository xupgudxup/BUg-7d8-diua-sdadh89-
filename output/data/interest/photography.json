    "fullText": "For a long while, digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras were the king of the castle for professional and amateur photography. They brought large sensors, interchangeable lenses, and professional-level viewfinders to the digital world at approachable prices, and then cemented their lead when they started being used to create video as well. They’re experiencing a bit of a decline now, though, as mirrorless cameras start to dominate, and with that comes some unique opportunities. To attach a lens meant for a DSLR to a mirrorless camera, an adapter housing must be used, and [Ancient] found a way to squeeze a computer and a programmable aperture into this tiny space.\n\nThe programmable aperture is based on an LCD screen from an old cell phone. LCD screens are generally transparent until their pixels are switched, and in most uses as displays a backer is put in place so someone can make out what is on the screen. [Ancient] is removing this backer, though, allowing the LCD to be completely transparent when switched off. The screen is placed inside this lens adapter housing in the middle of a PCB where a small computer is also placed. The computer controls the LCD via a set of buttons on the outside of the housing, allowing the photographer to use this screen as a programmable aperture.\n\nThe LCD-as-aperture has a number of interesting uses that would be impossible with a standard iris aperture. Not only can it function as a standard iris aperture, but it can do things like cycle through different areas of the image in sequence, open up arbitrary parts or close off others, and a number of other unique options. It’s worth checking out the video below, as [Ancient] demonstrates many of these effects towards the end. We’ve seen some of these effects before, although those were in lenses that were mechanically controlled instead.\n\nThanks to [kemfic] for the tip!",

    "fullText": "Many people bought the devices thinking they would do little more than protect their delivery packages\n\nWhat happens to the data that smart home cameras collect? Can law enforcement access this information – even when users aren’t aware officers may be viewing their footage? Two recent events have put these concerns in the spotlight.\n\nA Super Bowl ad by the doorbell-camera company Ring and the FBI’s pursuit of the kidnapper of Nancy Guthrie, the mother of Today show host Savannah Guthrie, have resurfaced longstanding concerns about surveillance against a backdrop of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. The fear is that home cameras’ video feeds could become yet another part of the government’s mass surveillance apparatus.\n\nRing’s Super Bowl ad appeared intended to inspire hope: a neighborhood harnessing the power of technology to find a lost dog: a distraught girl misses her pet, Milo, who has gone missing. Gone are the times of putting up “missing” posters. Simply posting Milo’s photo through the Ring app automatically alerts a host of nearby cameras to use AI to look for a match, the ad says. A neighbor then arrives on their porch with Milo, safe and sound. As they reunite, feel-good music plays. But the reference to the AI-powered feature Search Party, meant to mimic the activity of a real one, quickly triggered comparisons with a dystopian Black Mirror episode. Viewers wondered: if the company could quickly access hundreds of Ring cameras in a neighborhood to find a dog, what’s stopping it from targeting a person in the same way?\n\nIn Guthrie’s case, the FBI released a video Tuesday showing a masked person at her doorstep. But the footage appears to have been retrieved from a Google Nest camera that officials previously said was disconnected and lacking an active monthly subscription for premium features. Without a subscription, users cannot typically store footage. The publication of the footage from Guthrie’s home indicated that law enforcement could still access “residual data located in backend systems”, in the words of FBI director Kash Patel; cybersecurity experts have said this may be because doorbell cameras often have back-ups stored in a cloud. It’s currently unclear whether law enforcement used a warrant.\n\n“There’s a very distinct and marked difference between what you have access to – in terms of whether you’re paying for it or not – and what the company has access to,” said Chris Gilliard, a data privacy expert who has researched how wearables and smart doorbells are contributing to mass surveillance.\n\nNew images in the search for Nancy Guthrie:\n\nOver the last eight days, the FBI and Pima County Sheriff’s Department have been working closely with our private sector partners to continue to recover any images or video footage from Nancy Guthrie’s home that may have been lost,… pic.twitter.com/z5WLgPtZpT\n\nRing, owned by Amazon, and Nest say they comply with law enforcement requests for data, including footage, when it’s legally required and in instances where there’s a threat to someone’s life. Ring also says that federal law enforcement doesn’t have direct access to the data from the doorbell camera, telling Wirecutter in a statement that “Ring has no partnership with ICE, does not give ICE videos, feeds, or back-end access, and does not share video with them”. Ring has also said that the feature advertised as being able to find dogs can’t currently detect human biometrics. Nest has said in a transparency report that the company would not instantly hand over data to a federal agency with a search warrant. “We’d analyze the request to be sure the warrant wasn’t overly broad, then we’d make sure the information they requested was within the scope of the warrant,” the company stated.\n\nThere’s been a swift backlash, as people have become more aware of surveillance concerns tied to smart home devices. Many people bought these devices thinking they would do little more than protect their delivery packages. Lawmakers from across the aisle condemned Ring’s Super Bowl ad, with the US senator Ed Markey writing in an open letter on Wednesday that “it’s not hard to imagine the ways that Amazon – or law enforcement – could abuse this feature”. TikTok influencers called on people to “smash” their Ring doorbells, and Redditors shared tips on trying to get refunds on old Ring devices from Amazon. Graphics circulating on social media stated: “Your ring camera is an ICE agent.”\n\nRing appears to be feeling the heat. On Thursday, Amazon announced that Ring had cancelled its partnership with Flock Safety, which runs a network of automated license plate readers across the US. Flock says it does not give ICE or the Department of Homeland Security direct access to its systems, but news reports have documented an ongoing loophole: cases in which local law enforcement has used Flock’s tool in aiding federal immigration authorities.\n\nRing said in a blog post that the integration with Flock would “require significantly more time and resources than anticipated”. The company also stated that no customer videos had ever been sent to Flock, since the integration never launched, stressing a commitment to making neighborhoods safer.\n\nData-privacy advocates are not convinced by Ring’s commitment to community safety, though. “Ring is just trying to protect its bottom line,” said Jeramie D Scott, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center’s surveillance oversight program. Without additional federal protections, Scott worries Ring will continue to expand its surveillance capabilities despite the recent backtracking.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Ring has faced criticism over data protection. “Ring has a history of playing it pretty loose with people’s privacy rights,” said Beryl Lipton, senior investigative researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. In 2023, the Federal Trade Commission charged the company with “compromising its customers’ privacy by allowing any employee or contractor to access consumers’ private videos and by failing to implement basic privacy and security protections”. This, in turn, allowed hackers to “take control of consumers’ accounts, cameras, and videos”. Ring agreed to pay $5.8m in a settlement with the FTC.\n\nRing still has many partnerships with police, and with the return of its founder, Jamie Siminoff, who is now CEO, the company appears to be doubling down on its original emphasis on fighting crime. Siminoff said last year that his cameras can almost “zero-out crime”, though experts like Gilliard are skeptical. After Siminoff’s return, the company partnered with body-camera maker Axon to restart a tool that allows police to request footage through an online portal.\n\n“These companies – their typical strategy is to consistently push the envelope in small ways to acclimate us to more invasive uses of these things,” Gilliard said.",

    "fullText": "TAMPA, Fla. — As Gerrit Cole threw his first bullpen of spring training on Friday morning, a crowd of reporters made their best efforts to get a look through the mostly-covered fence that encaged the rehabbing righty.\n\nWhile those with cameras took turns sharing limited peepholes in order to snap a shot of Cole, who underwent Tommy John surgery last spring, the contingent that stood behind him enjoyed an unimpeded view. The group included manager Aaron Boone, pitching coaches Matt Blake and Desi Druschel, bench coach Brad Ausmus and guest instructor Ron Guidry, who all watched Cole consistently reach the mid-90s as he simulated two innings of work.\n\nCole, who had already thrown some bullpens in New York and California over the offseason, saw his velocity hit at least 96 mph, and he threw his full arsenal to Austin Wells.\n\n“He looked like a Cy Young pitcher,” the catcher said of Cole, who won the award in 2023. “He looked smooth and in control. He looked confident in his ability.”\n\n“Was nice and easy,” Guidry chimed in.\n\nBoone agreed with those assessments, likening an in-command Cole to a “diver that dives off the high board and just goes in the water and makes no splash.”\n\n“He looked like Gerrit Cole,” the manager added.\n\nCole also came away pleased, calling his session “well executed” while noting that his reconstructed elbow “feels really good.”\n\n“It feels different than it has been in quite some time,” he continued. “Feel is subjective, so we’ll have to see how it plays out.”\n\nSo far, all has gone according to plan for the 35-year-old, who battled elbow inflammation in 2024 before tearing his ulnar collateral ligament around this time last year. But while Cole has looked sharp thus far, Boone made it clear that the Yankees won’t be rushing him back or pushing him harder than he needs to be.\n\nCole, meanwhile, reiterated that full Tommy John reconstruction comes with a 14-18-month timetable.\n\n“So it really hasn’t changed,” Cole said, meaning he’s looking at returning sometime in May, the earlier end of the spectrum, or June.\n\nEarlier this week, Boone said that Cole is scheduled to start facing live hitters in “a couple weeks” and could “potentially” get in games before spring training ends. Cole said the latter goal is realistic, but that isn’t set in stone.\n\nCole is doing his best to stay present, as he is still in the midst of what he said has been a “long and tedious” process. That said, he’s certainly longing for real games after sitting out the entire 2025 season.\n\n“I just miss playing,” he said. “I miss that outlet of working hard and feeling exhausted every five days.”\n\nWhenever Cole does return, the Yankees will be banking on him being the best version of himself.\n\nThe club didn’t add another frontline starter this offseason despite some others having injury and workload concerns, partly because they have Cole coming back. But Tommy John surgery can come with setbacks, rust and even prolonged struggles — look at how Atlanta’s Spencer Strider fared last year — which is why Cole doesn’t want to get ahead of himself.\n\n“I’m a confident guy,” Cole said. “I have high expectations for my execution internally, but overall, in terms of performance and expectations, I don’t really have any set goals or numbers or things like that. It’s been working really well to just stay day-to-day and execute the task at hand, so I think the challenge is to continue to do that as things become more exciting and as things start to get rolling more and more.”\n\nBoone, however, isn’t going to doubt that Cole can return to form.\n\n“I’m not going to put any ceiling on what Gerrit could do once he’s back and in the rotation,” the skipper said, noting the high success rate of Tommy John surgery.\n\nSome have wondered if Cole will return with new experiments that he concocted during his down time, but the cerebral pitcher said not much has changed, aside from him having more time to lift in the weight room. Cole didn’t reveal any new pitches, and he said that his mechanics remain mostly the same.\n\nThere is one exception, as he’s now starting his windup by bringing his hands over his head.\n\n“It feels good,” Cole said when asked about the tweak. “I generally just like the rhythm of it.”",
