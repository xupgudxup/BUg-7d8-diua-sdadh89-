    "title": "Ex-Meta staffer nicknamed 'coding machine' says the best engineers aren't on LinkedIn — but they're special cases",
    "description": "Michael Novati , a former Meta principal software engineer, said the names of the best of the best engineers are \"nowhere\" online.",
    "fullText": "LinkedIn is full of corporate braggarts. But don't expect the best engineers to flaunt their success on the platform — or even have an account, according one former Meta employee.\n\nMichael Novati spent almost eight years at Meta, back when it was still called Facebook and hadn't yet doubled down on AI. He reached the rank of principal software engineer and earned the nickname \"coding machine.\"\n\nOn the \"A Life Engineered\" podcast, host Steve Huynh asked Novati about his claim that the top five engineers aren't on LinkedIn. Novati stood by it.\n\n\"When I was at Facebook, the top engineers were like, 'If you had a LinkedIn account, people would be wondering if you're job hunting,'\" he said.\n\nNovati said these engineers don't need to publicly job hunt because of tech's extensive recruiting arm, which he called the \"secrets of the industry.\"\n\n\"There are very senior, very highly paid recruiters that work at the top companies who have very strong long-term social relationships with a lot of top engineers,\" he said.\n\nHow do these engineers and recruiters meet? Novati gave the example of an engineer who spends a week doing campus recruiting at Stanford, bonding with the company's recruiter in the process.\n\nHe referred to these as the \"secret backroom dealings of Silicon Valley.\"\n\n\"These engineers' names are nowhere, but they are the ones that are the most desirable by these recruiters,\" he said. \"The $100 million engineer is not on LinkedIn with a tagline that's like, #100millionengineer.\"\n\nTech recruiting has long been a large, lucrative industry. Big Tech companies both employ in-house recruiters and outside agencies to stay close to key talent.\n\nMeanwhile, talent is becoming increasingly competitive, particularly in the field of AI. Meta shelled out large contracts for its Superintelligence Labs, poaching engineers from its competitors.\n\nSometimes CEOs even get involved. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly made a list of the top AI talent to poach. OpenAI's chief research officer said that Zuckerberg hand-delivered soup to an employee he was trying to recruit.\n\nOne AI worker told Business Insider they got a personal call from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, pitching them to join the company. They accepted.\n\nBeing offline may not be the golden key to tech recruiting, though. These top-tier engineers are a \"specific case,\" Novati said on the podcast.\n\n\"It doesn't mean that your strategy should be: delete LinkedIn and all the offers will come,\" he said.\n\nIt's a rarified class, Novati said, but one that stays away from all semblances of personal branding.\n\n\"I don't know any of those top engineers, who get special equity grants and special dinners with Bezos or whatever stuff like that, who have big personal brands,\" he said.",

However, as Jon Bentley cited in his famous book Programming Pearls, only a small percentage of people he asked—10% to be precise—were able to code this algorithm without any errors.\n\nHere, I will show you a correct implementation of binary search, its variants that appear in interviews, and LeetCode problems that you can solve using these techniques.\n\nGiven an array of items, we can find the position of a specific item linearly by iterating over the array, comparing each item with the desired item, and returning the position when the current item equals the desired item.\n\nWe must also consider the case where the desired item is not in the array; in this case, we can return any value. Since we are talking about positions in an array, we can return -1 if the item is not present. This is a very simple concept and implementation. However, if the array is sorted, we can do better.\n\nWe can find the position of an item in logarithmic time (O(log n)), where n is the number of items in the array, when the array is sorted.\n\nTo do this, we repeatedly compare the item we are looking for with the middle element of the array. If the middle element is the one we are looking for, we have our result. Otherwise, we need to update the range of the array we are considering accordingly.\n\nIf the element we are looking for is greater than the middle element, we need to search in the higher part of the array. Otherwise, we need to search in the lower part of the array.\n\nWhat we just described is the Binary Search algorithm. Below is the implementation of the binary search algorithm in C++:\n\nThis is less than 20 lines of code that you need to understand very well if you want to be successful in an interview. Note that I said “understand,” not “memorize.”\n\ncould be implemented in different ways, such as:\n\nCan you explain why the first implementation is better than the second?\n\nThe answer is integer overflow. When we add two integer numbers, we can exceed the maximum value allowed in the computer’s representation of an int. Knowing these details and how to answer such questions puts you in a much better position compared to other candidates.\n\nAs you can see, even a small detail can demonstrate your expertise and experience. All these small details together help you get the position you want.\n\nDespite these details, as I said, nobody will ask you to implement binary search directly. However, there are some important variants of the binary search algorithm that appear as part of problem-solving. I will describe four of them in the next sections.\n\nLet’s consider we have a sorted array with duplicate elements, such as [10, 20, 30, 30, 30, 40, 50]. Also, let’s assume we are searching for the element 30 and we need to find the smallest position of this element in case of duplication.\n\nWith the binary search algorithm implementation shown above, we cannot guarantee we will always return the smallest position of an element in case of duplication. However, we can modify the original algorithm to answer this question correctly.\n\nAnd here is a very important point: You can only make this modification if you know the binary search algorithm and its implementation well.\n\nThinking about the problem, instead of returning the position when we find the element in the array, we need to update our result and continue the search in the lower part of the array.\n\nUpdating the result instead of returning immediately is easy to see. You cannot return immediately because there may be duplicate elements in the array. Since we want the smallest position, we cannot just return.\n\nSo, why go to the lower part of the array instead of the higher part? The answer is because of the problem definition: we want the smallest index. So, if we find the element, in case of duplication, we are interested in the presence of this element before the current position.\n\nThe implementation in C++ could be:\n\nThis problem is similar to the one above, but now we are interested in the higher part of the array in case of duplication. This is because we want the largest index instead of the smallest one.\n\nIn this case, the implementation in C++ could be:\n\nThis is a little different, but only slightly. Now, we are not interested in finding an element, but the largest value less than the given element. So, every time we find an element that is smaller than our desired element, we need to update our result. We also need to update the considered range of the array.\n\nIn this case, we are interested in the higher part of the array, since we are trying to find the largest value less than our element.\n\nThe implementation in C++ could be:\n\nSimilar to the problem above, but now we are interested in finding the smallest value greater than the desired value. So, we need to update our result when we find a larger element instead of a smaller one.\n\nThe implementation in C++ could be:\n\nHere are some interesting problems to solve on LeetCode using the techniques explained in this post:",

    "description": "Recently, people have been asking me why I’m pausing Boo to work on a programming language. I think it would actually be cool to write down how I feel.",
    "fullText": "So, I woke up today. Got my coffee, family went to sleep, and I have a free afternoon.\n\nI thought about writing something. I may delete this article, but if you are reading this, it means I went through with it.\n\nRecently, people have been asking me why I’m pausing Boo to work on a programming language. I think it would actually be cool to write down how I feel.\n\nBoo is a code editor I created solely for myself; I never had the intention of making it a mainstream editor. Of course, it would be fun if people used it, but that was never my goal. This year I got it working in a functional state, where I can actually use it for my daily work. It has innovative human-keyboard navigation and replaces the LSP system with something faster and less costly for the OS. So why on earth am I not open-sourcing it? That’s what people keep asking me.\n\nMy mind isn’t really moved by the idea that it would be a success or a failure — the end user of Boo is me. I don’t feel it’s there yet; in fact, I think software should inspire us. Working on Rio Terminal and Boo in my free time — both written in Rust and sharing many similarities — affects my joy, because it starts to become something automatic. Both have similar architecture, language, release process, and etcetera.\n\nSince I was a kid, I liked to build Lego blocks. That’s probably what I did the most besides playing football or video games. The fun thing about Lego is that one day you can build a castle, and the next day you can build a ship. Not necessarily using the same pieces and colors — you can actually add a lot of stuff that’s external to what you have, like a wood stick.\n\nWhen programming becomes repetitive, the odds of you creating something that makes people go “wow” are reduced quite a bit. It isn’t a rule, of course. You need to be inspired to make inspiring software.\n\nI always use the example of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. This game is so well crafted that I know people who don’t even like video games but bought a console just to play it — and once they finished, they sold everything. This is what I’m talking about: taking time to build something so that once people try it, they remember it for as long as they live.\n\nBoo isn’t a business. I don’t need or want to make money out of it. I don’t have a deadline, nor do I want to create another VS Code. I don’t feel like forcing it to happen.\n\nIn that case, I don’t necessarily need to stop building Lego blocks, right? I’ll just park it there, and when the inspiration comes back, I’ll pick it up where it was. That being said, I paused Boo, and I am working on my own programming language. Eventually, my idea is to rewrite Boo to use it.\n\n“Wow! That’s a lot of work.” Indeed. But it’s my hobby stuff. I’ve always loved programming languages, and I am having a blast learning more about binaries and compilers. So, I don’t really feel I need to follow people’s cake recipe for success. That’s how my mind works, and I will stick with it.",
