If we had a motto it would be “no vibes allowed” - we believe that AI agent-enabled coding is a deeply technical engineering craft, and we’re building CodeLayer to unlock it at scale. A Stanford study from June 2025 said AI can’t solve hard problems or work well in complex or legacy codebases, and we’re proving them wrong with advanced techniques inspired by Context Engineering (a term originally coined by our CEO Dex in April 2025).
