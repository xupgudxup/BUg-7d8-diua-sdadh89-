    "fullText": "“How to get better at programming?” is the question I had been asked quite a few times, and today I lay down the 8 rituals I have been following, and action items for each, to be good and get better at programming.\n\nDoing something repeatedly always helps and writing a lot of code will develop our ability to\n\nIf we don’t do something repeatedly, it becomes extremely hard to get good at it. Writing code consistently helps us\n\nSolving programming questions is about developing logic but things become a little trickier when we build a complex system, as it requires us to take our programming skills to go up a notch. Some examples of complex systems are - a Library management system, a Twitter clone, an Instagram clone, etc. Building a complex system\n\nAfter we spend some time writing programs and solving problems, things become monotonous and do not seem to challenge us anymore, so to spice things up a bit we should model something from the real world, like\n\nThere are lots of libraries and framework like p5.js that makes visual programming simple.\n\nIt is not only writing code that improves our programming skills but it is reading some quality code written by expert programmers that make the difference. Reading code written by experts improve our programming vocabulary and by doing this we\n\nThe best way to start doing it is by picking up an open-source project and start skimming the code. It is okay to not understand it in the first go but it is important to skim it a few times and get acquainted. After a few skim, everything will fall in place, the code becomes familiar and we start to understand the flow and business logic.\n\nThere is always someone sitting on the other side of the globe, who knows a thing or two more than us. Look for them and collaborate on a project. The developer community is filled with super smart and super enthusiastic developers who love to share and collaborate. Use websites like Dev.to, Hashnode and Twitter to find and interact with like-minded people.\n\nA programming language is just a tool to express business logic. While learning a programming language we should try to understand the constructs and paradigms used - for example: Functional programming, Polymorphism, Event driven programming, Actor model, etc. It is important to do so because we could pick constructs from one language and use it in another to solve our problem. For example: picking Functional programming (Callbacks) from Javascript and using it in Python to create generic action functions.\n\nWriting code before putting in some thought is degraded the code more often than not. The code written like this lacks simplicity, reusability, and extensibility. Spending some time thinking about problem statement or task at hand and having a rough execution plan always helps.\n\nThese rituals have helped me get better at programming with time and in parallel, I pick at max 3 and act on the action items. Programming is simple but being better than most is difficult. Doing it consistently makes one get better by the day.",

    "fullText": "If you needed a sign for how determined AI-land is to achieve AGI quickly, it's that one of its leaders sees the speed of human typing as one of its biggest roadblocks.\n\nAlexander Embiricos, who leads product development for Codex, OpenAI's coding agent, said on \"Lenny's Podcast\" on Sunday that the \"current underappreciated limiting factor\" to AGI is \"human typing speed\" or \"human multi-tasking speed on writing prompts.\"\n\nAGI, or artificial general intelligence, is a still theoretical version of AI that reasons as well or better than humans. It's the thing all the big AI companies are competing to be the first to realize.\n\n\"You can have an agent watch all the work you're doing, but if you don't have the agent also validating its work, then you're still bottlenecked on, like, can you go review all that code?\" Embiricos said.\n\nEmbiricos' view is that we need to unburden humans from having to write prompts and validate AI's work, since we aren't fast enough.\n\n\"If we can rebuild systems to let the agent be default useful, we'll start unlocking hockey sticks,\" he said.\n\n\"Hockey stick growth\" is a term used to describe a growth curve that starts out flat and suddenly spikes, mirroring the shape of a hockey stick.\n\nEmbiricos said there's no simple path to a fully automated workflow — each use case will require its own approach — but he expects to see progress toward this level of growth soon.\n\n\"Starting next year, we're going to see early adopters starting to hockey stick their productivity, and then over the years that follow, we're going to see larger and larger companies hockey stick that productivity,\" he said.\n\nSomewhere in between the time early adopters start to see gains in productivity and when tech giants manage to fully automate processes with AI agents is when we'll see AGI, Embiricos said.\n\n\"That hockey-sticking will be flowing back into the AI labs, and that's when we'll basically be at the AGI,\" he said.",

    "description": "Many IT professionals would recommend Python as the best programming language for beginners. Why? The syntax of the Python code is considered simple.",
    "fullText": "TL;DR: Python leads with 29.85% market share driven by AI/ML demand, while JavaScript remains essential for web development. But here’s what most hiring managers miss: the rise of AI-powered coding tools like GitHub Copilot has fundamentally altered what skills you should prioritize when building your engineering team.\n\nThe question isn’t simply “which programming language should we hire for?” anymore. Companies are increasingly leveraging AI to automate routine coding tasks, reducing the need for large engineering teams and prioritizing professionals who can manage AI-driven workflows rather than simply write code.\n\nLet’s cut through the noise and examine what’s actually happening in today’s tech hiring landscape.\n\nSoftware developer job listings are down 35% from their 2022 peak, but don’t let that fool you into thinking demand has disappeared. Most technology positions tracked by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show unemployment rates well below the national average—software developers at 2.8%, systems analysts at 1.8%, and security analysts at 2.3%.\n\nWhat’s changed is selectivity. Companies are becoming more selective with their technical hires while businesses struggle to ship quickly due to a shortage of qualified engineers. The old approach of scanning resumes for keyword matches no longer works when every engineer claims “full-stack” experience.\n\nPython dominates with 29.85% market share, and it’s no surprise given AI and machine learning’s explosive growth. But here’s what matters for your hiring strategy: the type of Python developer you need has evolved.\n\nTraditional Python roles focused on web development with Django or Flask. Modern Python roles require understanding of:\n\nWhen interviewing Python candidates, dig beyond syntax knowledge. Ask: “How would you architect a system that processes real-time data for ML model inference?” The answer reveals whether they understand modern Python’s role in AI-driven products.\n\nJavaScript maintains its position with 7.92% market share, remaining essential for front-end development. But traditional frontend development is seeing fewer job postings, suggesting a shift toward full-stack or specialized backend roles.\n\nThe modern JavaScript landscape demands expertise in:\n\nTypeScript continues gaining popularity for large-scale web development, with its static typing and enhanced tooling making it preferred for complex applications. If your product serves enterprise clients or handles complex state management, TypeScript experience isn’t optional, it’s essential.\n\nGo’s popularity continues to grow as global demand for cloud computing rises, with its simple syntax, built-in concurrency support, and high performance making it well-suited for cloud-native applications.\n\nRust is emerging for system-level programming where memory safety and performance are critical. Rust’s memory safety, high performance, and robust security properties make it particularly well-suited for performance- and safety-critical applications.\n\nIf your architecture includes real-time systems, embedded software, or blockchain applications, Rust expertise provides competitive advantages that Go simply cannot match.\n\nIn this article, you can find answers to these questions. Keep in mind that these are all useful languages that will bring you closer to your goal if you’re committed.\n\nDespite competition from newer languages like Kotlin and Go, Java remains widely used in enterprise software, Android development, and backend systems. But the Java developer you need in 2025 looks different from five years ago.\n\nModern Java development requires:\n\nC# has been increasingly utilized in game development and enterprise software, with deep integration with the Unity game engine cementing C# as a top game developer language. For enterprise applications, .NET’s cross-platform capabilities make C# developers valuable for modernizing legacy Windows-based systems.\n\nAccording to research for the Demand for Skilled Talent report, the most evident skills gap on technology teams is within AI, machine learning and data science. But let’s be specific about what this means for different roles:\n\nPlatform-focused AI engineers build centralized tools and infrastructure to accelerate AI development, while product-focused AI engineers work inside product teams and ship AI features for users. Understanding this distinction helps you write better job descriptions and evaluate candidates correctly.\n\nDevelopers who can maintain and modernize legacy systems are highly valued, with work including ensuring security, improving performance, and integrating legacy systems with newer technologies like APIs or microservices. Many companies underestimate this need when planning their hiring strategy.\n\nCloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure are at the core of modern software infrastructure, with over 90% of global enterprises expected to use cloud platforms by 2025.\n\nCritical cloud competencies include:\n\nWhen evaluating DevOps candidates, focus on their experience with incident response and disaster recovery. Anyone can deploy to the cloud; few can architect systems that gracefully handle failure at scale.\n\nEnterprise blockchain adoption is driving legitimate technical roles:\n\nMajor industries entering the space, including finance, healthcare and logistics, are expanding demand for blockchain engineers. When Deutsche Bank builds blockchain settlement systems or Nike creates digital collectibles, they need engineers who understand both traditional software architecture and decentralized protocols.\n\nEntry-level Solidity developers can write basic smart contracts and deploy them to testnets. Senior Solidity engineers architect systems that handle millions in value while remaining secure and gas-efficient.\n\nCore technical competencies for serious Solidity roles:\n\nFor Startups and Scale-ups: Python and JavaScript remain your best bets for rapid development and talent availability. The ecosystem maturity and hiring pool depth outweigh cutting-edge performance considerations.\n\nFor Enterprise and Financial Services: Java and C# provide the stability, security, and regulatory compliance frameworks that regulated industries require. Don’t chase trends when handling mission-critical systems.\n\nFor Performance-Critical Applications: Go for backend services, Rust for system programming, and C++ for real-time applications. Latency requirements should drive language selection, not popularity metrics.\n\nFor AI/ML Products: Python dominates, but consider Julia for scientific computing or R for statistical analysis. Language choice depends on your specific AI use case and team expertise.\n\nGiven 95% of tech leaders face challenges finding skilled workers, your approach to technical hiring needs to evolve beyond traditional methods.\n\nFocus on fundamental problem-solving over specific syntax knowledge. A strong engineer can learn new languages; analytical thinking and system design skills transfer across technologies.\n\nPrioritize hands-on experience with real-world projects over certification collections. Ask candidates to walk through architecture decisions they’ve made and trade-offs they’ve considered.\n\nEvaluate AI collaboration skills. The shift toward engineers with expertise in AI augmentation, system architecture, and cross-functional problem-solving means traditional coding assessments miss crucial competencies.\n\nIt’s easy enough for software engineers to become AI engineers: just build applications on top of LLMs. This accessibility is reshaping what skills remain uniquely human and valuable.\n\nLanguages that enhance AI productivity:\n\nThe programming languages your team learns should align with how AI tools augment rather than replace human developers. Focus on languages that excel in areas where human judgment and creativity remain irreplaceable: system architecture, user experience design, and complex business logic implementation.\n\nBottom Line: The most important programming language for your 2025 hiring strategy isn’t determined by popularity rankings—it’s the one that best matches your technical architecture, team experience, and business requirements. Technology hiring trends in 2025 indicate that candidates place high value on exposure to AI and machine learning projects, as these skills significantly enhance their career trajectories.\n\nThe companies succeeding in today’s competitive hiring market understand that language proficiency is just the foundation. The real competitive advantage comes from engineers who can architect systems, collaborate with AI tools, and adapt to evolving technical requirements.\n\nReady to build a hiring strategy that actually reflects today’s market realities? Let’s discuss how the current tech landscape impacts your specific technical requirements and talent acquisition approach.",

    "description": "This decision forces Terraform's users to migrate to HCL, drawing criticism from those who point to the CDK's popularity as proof Terraform still needs advanced programming capabilities.",
    "fullText": "Going forward, when you run IBM‘s Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC) software, you will have one language to write your configurations: the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).\n\nOn Monday, HashiCorp, an IBM company, announced that it will no longer support the Terraform Cloud Development Kit (CDK or CDKTF). Although the existing code will remain available in a GitHub archive, HashiCorp will no longer maintain or update the code, leaving it all but unusable for enterprises.\n\n“Unfortunately, Terraform CDK did not find product-market fit at scale. HashiCorp, an IBM Company, has chosen to focus its investments on Terraform core and its broader ecosystem,” a note on the site read.\n\nThe CDK itself is licensed under the Mozilla Public License (MPL), so users are free to fork the software itself, IBM suggested.\n\nThe company, however, is encouraging users to use HCL, which was developed by HashiCorp and licensed under the Mozilla Public License (MPL), originally designed for the software.\n\nOriginally released in 2014 by HashiCorp, Terraform is software that allows administrators to automate the deployment of IT infrastructure, either in the cloud or on premises, through the use of scripts and a set of Terraform commands such as terraform init, terraform plan and terraform apply. The output is rendered as JSON.\n\nOver time, Terraform has become the most popular software for automated IT deployment, especially in the cloud native community.\n\nIn 2023, HashiCorp switched the Terraform license from open source to a Business Source License, which spurred a user-based open source fork of the software, called OpenTofu, that was adopted by the Linux Foundation and, later, by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).\n\nIn 2024, IBM announced it was acquiring HashiCorp and finalized the purchase earlier this year.\n\nDespite a call to open source the CDK, IBM is encouraging current users to adopt the HCL if they are not already doing so.\n\n“If you are not using AWS CDK, we highly recommend migrating to standard Terraform and HCL for long-term support and ecosystem alignment,” the company asserted.\n\nTerraform users with .tf files created under the CDK can convert them to HCL with the following command:\n\nThose using CDTF on Amazon Web Services infrastructure can also use AWS’ own CDK.\n\nOverall, the Infrastructure as Code user base appears to be chafing from the limits of IaC.\n\nAs a result, many alternative approaches to Terraform have popped up in the last few years, including Adam Jacob’s System Initiative and Formae from Platform Engineering Labs.\n\nThey point to how HCL has its limits, especially for highly scalable environments. A declarative configuration language, HCL is limited in offering advanced programming constructs, and many resulting workarounds have resulted in obtuse code. Tooling is limited as well.\n\nThe advantage that the CDKTF brought to users was that it allowed them to detail deployment instructions through their own favorite programming language rather than HCL. CDKTF supported TypeScript, Python, C# and the Go programming language.\n\nThis is also the approach that Terraform competitor Pulumi has staked out, namely the ability to provision infrastructure in any one of a number of programming languages.\n\nYet, there has also been considerable debate around whether a general-purpose programming language is better than a domain-specific language. Terraform’s users are administrators, not programmers, as critics have pointed out.\n\nNonetheless, many of those in the IaC community took the news hard. Kubernetes expert David Flanagan noted that the development kit has gotten over 140,000 downloads per week for TypeScript alone, with similar numbers in other language communities.\n\nSo clearly, the CDKTF is still highly used by the community, he argued.\n\nFuck you, Hashicorp … an IBM Company. pic.twitter.com/h1EicnT3pL\n\n— David Flanagan (@rawkode), Dec. 11, 2025\n\n“You don’t kill a project with [an estimated] million users every single month because nobody likes it or it doesn’t have a ‘market fit.’ You kill it because it is not increasing your profit margin, it is not selling enterprise licenses,” Flanagan said in a short video.\n\nTo be fair, IBM has a long history of buying open source-based companies, and keeping the open source licensing intact, including the Linux-based Red Hat, the Cassandra-focused Datastax and, most recently, the Kafka-based Confluent. (There’s been no word, however, on whether IBM would revert the Terraform license back to open source.)\n\nFlanagan went on to note that people are probably using the CDKTF because they require the additional programming capabilities. “It’s called Infrastructure as Code, not Infrastructure as JSON,” he quipped.\n\nSite reliability engineer Liz Fong-Jones offered a more measured response.\n\n“To be more gentle about this, HashiCorp has decided to stop trying to compete with Pulumi with language-native APIs; they’re all in on HCL as the only way to work with Terraform,” Fong-Jones wrote on BlueSky.\n\nIn fact, others think this may not be a bad idea.\n\nPlatform Engineering Labs’ Co-Founder and CEO Pavlo Baron thought the IBM move made sense.\n\n“IBM is historically good at optimizing for the target buyer. This is rather a sign that nobody on the right side of the cycle wants to do full-blown programming. CDKs, and this includes the approach Pulumi takes, are exclusively for developers. Developers usually don’t operate infrastructure,” he wrote by email.\n\n“Serious operations happen on the right side of the cycle, though. Thus, the CDK is missing their target user and addresses the wrong one. So I understand and support the logic behind this move.”",

    "description": "Michael Novati , a former Meta principal software engineer, said the names of the best of the best engineers are \"nowhere\" online.",
    "fullText": "LinkedIn is full of corporate braggarts. But don't expect the best engineers to flaunt their success on the platform — or even have an account, according one former Meta employee.\n\nMichael Novati spent almost eight years at Meta, back when it was still called Facebook and hadn't yet doubled down on AI. He reached the rank of principal software engineer and earned the nickname \"coding machine.\"\n\nOn the \"A Life Engineered\" podcast, host Steve Huynh asked Novati about his claim that the top five engineers aren't on LinkedIn. Novati stood by it.\n\n\"When I was at Facebook, the top engineers were like, 'If you had a LinkedIn account, people would be wondering if you're job hunting,'\" he said.\n\nNovati said these engineers don't need to publicly job hunt because of tech's extensive recruiting arm, which he called the \"secrets of the industry.\"\n\n\"There are very senior, very highly paid recruiters that work at the top companies who have very strong long-term social relationships with a lot of top engineers,\" he said.\n\nHow do these engineers and recruiters meet? Novati gave the example of an engineer who spends a week doing campus recruiting at Stanford, bonding with the company's recruiter in the process.\n\nHe referred to these as the \"secret backroom dealings of Silicon Valley.\"\n\n\"These engineers' names are nowhere, but they are the ones that are the most desirable by these recruiters,\" he said. \"The $100 million engineer is not on LinkedIn with a tagline that's like, #100millionengineer.\"\n\nTech recruiting has long been a large, lucrative industry. Big Tech companies both employ in-house recruiters and outside agencies to stay close to key talent.\n\nMeanwhile, talent is becoming increasingly competitive, particularly in the field of AI. Meta shelled out large contracts for its Superintelligence Labs, poaching engineers from its competitors.\n\nSometimes CEOs even get involved. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly made a list of the top AI talent to poach. OpenAI's chief research officer said that Zuckerberg hand-delivered soup to an employee he was trying to recruit.\n\nOne AI worker told Business Insider they got a personal call from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, pitching them to join the company. They accepted.\n\nBeing offline may not be the golden key to tech recruiting, though. These top-tier engineers are a \"specific case,\" Novati said on the podcast.\n\n\"It doesn't mean that your strategy should be: delete LinkedIn and all the offers will come,\" he said.\n\nIt's a rarified class, Novati said, but one that stays away from all semblances of personal branding.\n\n\"I don't know any of those top engineers, who get special equity grants and special dinners with Bezos or whatever stuff like that, who have big personal brands,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "One of the most fundamental algorithms that appears in interviews at big tech companies is Binary Search. Of course, nobody will ask you to implement binary search directly. However, as Jon Bentley cited in his famous book Programming Pearls, only a small percentage of people he asked—10% to be precise—were able to code this algorithm without any errors.\n\nHere, I will show you a correct implementation of binary search, its variants that appear in interviews, and LeetCode problems that you can solve using these techniques.\n\nGiven an array of items, we can find the position of a specific item linearly by iterating over the array, comparing each item with the desired item, and returning the position when the current item equals the desired item.\n\nWe must also consider the case where the desired item is not in the array; in this case, we can return any value. Since we are talking about positions in an array, we can return -1 if the item is not present. This is a very simple concept and implementation. However, if the array is sorted, we can do better.\n\nWe can find the position of an item in logarithmic time (O(log n)), where n is the number of items in the array, when the array is sorted.\n\nTo do this, we repeatedly compare the item we are looking for with the middle element of the array. If the middle element is the one we are looking for, we have our result. Otherwise, we need to update the range of the array we are considering accordingly.\n\nIf the element we are looking for is greater than the middle element, we need to search in the higher part of the array. Otherwise, we need to search in the lower part of the array.\n\nWhat we just described is the Binary Search algorithm. Below is the implementation of the binary search algorithm in C++:\n\nThis is less than 20 lines of code that you need to understand very well if you want to be successful in an interview. Note that I said “understand,” not “memorize.”\n\ncould be implemented in different ways, such as:\n\nCan you explain why the first implementation is better than the second?\n\nThe answer is integer overflow. When we add two integer numbers, we can exceed the maximum value allowed in the computer’s representation of an int. Knowing these details and how to answer such questions puts you in a much better position compared to other candidates.\n\nAs you can see, even a small detail can demonstrate your expertise and experience. All these small details together help you get the position you want.\n\nDespite these details, as I said, nobody will ask you to implement binary search directly. However, there are some important variants of the binary search algorithm that appear as part of problem-solving. I will describe four of them in the next sections.\n\nLet’s consider we have a sorted array with duplicate elements, such as [10, 20, 30, 30, 30, 40, 50]. Also, let’s assume we are searching for the element 30 and we need to find the smallest position of this element in case of duplication.\n\nWith the binary search algorithm implementation shown above, we cannot guarantee we will always return the smallest position of an element in case of duplication. However, we can modify the original algorithm to answer this question correctly.\n\nAnd here is a very important point: You can only make this modification if you know the binary search algorithm and its implementation well.\n\nThinking about the problem, instead of returning the position when we find the element in the array, we need to update our result and continue the search in the lower part of the array.\n\nUpdating the result instead of returning immediately is easy to see. You cannot return immediately because there may be duplicate elements in the array. Since we want the smallest position, we cannot just return.\n\nSo, why go to the lower part of the array instead of the higher part? The answer is because of the problem definition: we want the smallest index. So, if we find the element, in case of duplication, we are interested in the presence of this element before the current position.\n\nThe implementation in C++ could be:\n\nThis problem is similar to the one above, but now we are interested in the higher part of the array in case of duplication. This is because we want the largest index instead of the smallest one.\n\nIn this case, the implementation in C++ could be:\n\nThis is a little different, but only slightly. Now, we are not interested in finding an element, but the largest value less than the given element. So, every time we find an element that is smaller than our desired element, we need to update our result. We also need to update the considered range of the array.\n\nIn this case, we are interested in the higher part of the array, since we are trying to find the largest value less than our element.\n\nThe implementation in C++ could be:\n\nSimilar to the problem above, but now we are interested in finding the smallest value greater than the desired value. So, we need to update our result when we find a larger element instead of a smaller one.\n\nThe implementation in C++ could be:\n\nHere are some interesting problems to solve on LeetCode using the techniques explained in this post:",

    "description": "Recently, people have been asking me why I’m pausing Boo to work on a programming language. I think it would actually be cool to write down how I feel.",
    "fullText": "So, I woke up today. Got my coffee, family went to sleep, and I have a free afternoon.\n\nI thought about writing something. I may delete this article, but if you are reading this, it means I went through with it.\n\nRecently, people have been asking me why I’m pausing Boo to work on a programming language. I think it would actually be cool to write down how I feel.\n\nBoo is a code editor I created solely for myself; I never had the intention of making it a mainstream editor. Of course, it would be fun if people used it, but that was never my goal. This year I got it working in a functional state, where I can actually use it for my daily work. It has innovative human-keyboard navigation and replaces the LSP system with something faster and less costly for the OS. So why on earth am I not open-sourcing it? That’s what people keep asking me.\n\nMy mind isn’t really moved by the idea that it would be a success or a failure — the end user of Boo is me. I don’t feel it’s there yet; in fact, I think software should inspire us. Working on Rio Terminal and Boo in my free time — both written in Rust and sharing many similarities — affects my joy, because it starts to become something automatic. Both have similar architecture, language, release process, and etcetera.\n\nSince I was a kid, I liked to build Lego blocks. That’s probably what I did the most besides playing football or video games. The fun thing about Lego is that one day you can build a castle, and the next day you can build a ship. Not necessarily using the same pieces and colors — you can actually add a lot of stuff that’s external to what you have, like a wood stick.\n\nWhen programming becomes repetitive, the odds of you creating something that makes people go “wow” are reduced quite a bit. It isn’t a rule, of course. You need to be inspired to make inspiring software.\n\nI always use the example of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. This game is so well crafted that I know people who don’t even like video games but bought a console just to play it — and once they finished, they sold everything. This is what I’m talking about: taking time to build something so that once people try it, they remember it for as long as they live.\n\nBoo isn’t a business. I don’t need or want to make money out of it. I don’t have a deadline, nor do I want to create another VS Code. I don’t feel like forcing it to happen.\n\nIn that case, I don’t necessarily need to stop building Lego blocks, right? I’ll just park it there, and when the inspiration comes back, I’ll pick it up where it was. That being said, I paused Boo, and I am working on my own programming language. Eventually, my idea is to rewrite Boo to use it.\n\n“Wow! That’s a lot of work.” Indeed. But it’s my hobby stuff. I’ve always loved programming languages, and I am having a blast learning more about binaries and compilers. So, I don’t really feel I need to follow people’s cake recipe for success. That’s how my mind works, and I will stick with it.",
