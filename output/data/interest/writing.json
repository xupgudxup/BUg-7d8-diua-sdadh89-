    "description": "A movie based on Activision's Call of Duty series is in the works now at Paramount, which is now led by billionaire and Call of Duty superfan David Ellison. Prolific writer and director Taylor Sheridan is writing the script for the film, with Lone Survivor director Peter Berg attached to direct.\nActivision had been trying to make Call of Duty movies for years, so why is it finally happening now? Xbox boss Matt Booty told Variety that \"a relationship came about\" between people at Paramount and senior executives working on Call of Duty. \"They felt like they found a partner who understands the game, people who play the game, and shared a vision of what it could be to bring that forward,\" Booty said.",

    "fullText": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia must be freed from immigration detention while he fights his deportation, a judge ruled Thursday, handing a major victory to the immigrant whose wrongful deportation to a notorious prison in El Salvador made him a flashpoint of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement to let Abrego Garcia go immediately, writing that federal authorities had detained him again after his return to the United States without any legal basis.\n\n“For this reason, the Court will GRANT Abrego Garcia’s Petition for immediate release from ICE custody,” the judge wrote.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security sharply criticized the decision and vowed to appeal, calling the ruling “naked judicial activism” by a judge appointed during the Obama administration.\n\n“This order lacks any valid legal basis, and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary. The judge gave prosecutors until 5 p.m. EST to formally respond to the release order.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment, and messages seeking comment from Abrego Garcia’s attorney were not immediately returned.\n\nAbrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national with an American wife and child, has lived in Maryland for years but entered the U.S. illegally as a teenager. An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that he could not be deported to El Salvador because he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family. When he was mistakenly sent there in March, his case became a rallying point for those who oppose President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement actions.\n\nA court later ordered his return to the United States. Since he cannot be removed to El Salvador, ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries. His federal suit claims the Trump administration is illegally using the removal process to punish Abrego Garcia for the public embarrassment caused by his deportation.\n\nIn her order releasing Abrego Garcia, Xinis wrote that federal authorities “did not just stonewall” the court, “They affirmatively misled the tribunal.” The judge was referencing the successive list of four African countries that officials had sought to remove Abrego Garcia seemingly without commitments from those countries, as well as officials' affirmations that Costa Rica withdrew its offer to accept him, a claim later proven untrue.\n\n“But Costa Rica had never wavered in its commitment to receive Abrego Garcia, just as Abrego Garcia never wavered in his commitment to resettle there,” the judge wrote.\n\nXinis also rejected the government’s argument that she lacked jurisdiction to intervene on a final removal order for Abrego Garcia, because she found no final order had been filed.\n\nSeparately, Abrego Garcia is asking an immigration court to reopen his case so he can seek asylum in the United States.\n\nHe is also criminally charged in Tennessee, where he has pleaded not guilty to human smuggling. He has asked the federal court to dismiss the case, arguing the prosecution is vindictive. His defense attorney in Tennessee, Sean Hecker, declined to comment.\n\nA judge in that case has ordered an evidentiary hearing after previously finding some evidence that the charges “may be vindictive.” The judge also noted several statements by Trump administration officials that “raise cause for concern,” including a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that seemed to suggest the Justice Department charged Abrego Garcia because he won his wrongful deportation case. ___\n\nLoller reported from Nashville, Seewer reported from Toledo, Ohio and Lauer reported from Philadelphia.

    "fullText": "What started as Guillaume Broche’s personal project has been nominated for 12 Game awards, sold more than 2m copies and been praised by Emmanuel Macron as a ‘shining example of French audacity’\n\nThe record-breaking 12 nominations at the Game awards this year was beyond the wildest dreams of Guillaume Broche when he first began inking out Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 as a personal project while working at Ubisoft.\n\nBefore selling more than 2m copies, the narrative-driven roleplaying game with “a unique world, challenging combat and great writing” was a technical demo called We Lost. It was Broche’s appetite for risk and a few hopeful Reddit posts that would create the game’s world of Lumiere and its struggle against the Paintress.\n\n“I was doing like eight hours per day after work and not sleeping at all for a few years,” Broche says. And while he would be joined by Tom Guillermin on the programming side and Francoise Meurisse as producer, the next few members of the nascent studio – Lorien Testard, lead composer and Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, lead writer – would only come to Clair Obscur by chance, via social media.\n\nTestard, a guitar teacher at the time who had never composed or published any music commerically, was discovered by Broche on SoundCloud. “We liked the same philosophy in games,” says Testard, who had been writing music inspired by his favourite titles. Similarly, Broche found his art director, Nicholas Maxson-Francombe, through personal works he posted on ArtStation. “We are all deeply engaged in our subject areas,” says Svedberg-Yen, who says that was what bonded the team together. “If you listen to Nicolas talk about art or Lorien talk about music, it’s just something that fills our minds and our days.”\n\nSvedberg-Yen, meanwhile, had come from the world of finance. She saw Broche’s Reddit post and auditioned to not only write but also to voice some of the prototype characters of Clair Obscur, namely Maelle and Lune. Despite a deep love for video games, storytelling and a childhood engrossed in novels, Svedberg-Yen had not considered it as a career option. “It never crossed my mind as possible. As the adage goes, for Asian parents [it’s] doctors, lawyers, or finance.”\n\nWith a rudimentary team assembled under the banner of a new studio, Sandfall Interactive, they rebooted We Lost as Clair Obscur. It was there a world took shape and the gained its unmistakeable Belle Époque setting. “There’s a specificity,” Svedberg-Yens says. “I think that vision gets diluted when you’re trying to appeal to too many people.”\n\n“It’s not meant to be French propaganda,” jokes Broche, about the game’s very Gallic aesthetic. The characters yell putain and merde, there are berets and extremely scary mimes not only because it’s fun, he says, but born from a desire to make something “sincere and authentic”.\n\nSame goes for the story. Clair Obscur’s narrative drives the game forward and, as lead writer, Svedberg-Yen says it all has a “grounding and a basis in truth”.\n\n“We are all first-time writer and game developers in this sense … and so we kind of only know instinctively how write to what instinctively comes from within. And for a lot of the characters in those particular situations, to write them [you] have to really delve into the parts of my life that resonate with the situation that they’re in.”\n\nAccording to Svedberg-Yen, a conversation Broche had with his mother became core to the story’s emotional heft. When he asked her what would be the worst thing that could possibly happen, his mother responded saying it would be to lose her children. “The story deals with a lot of trauma,” she says, and that process of writing like that was often a scary process. “If people don’t like it, they don’t like you.” It was this ability to be vulnerable and open a communicative environment that Broche believes contributed to the success of the game.\n\nDespite an anxiety in the industry about the rise of AI in the development of video games, the team at Sandfall isn’t worried – especially Testard, who composed the game’s orchestral score based off the narrative beats of the game and the eponymous concept of clair obscur (or chiaroscuro), AKA the interplay of light and dark. “Music is the language of the soul,” he says. In fact, the evolution of technology like Unreal Engine 4 and the later 5, which the game runs on today, made a lot of the game possible. “More games will be 3D, because we have a lot of tools now,” says Broche, who describes the budget of his game to be on the “lower end of AA.”\n\nThe team at Sandfall have been overwhelmed by their success. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, lauded the game as “shining example of French audacity”. None of them expected the experience of Clair Obscur to resonate so deeply with so many people. “I’ve gotten a lot of very heartfelt messages from players who have experienced loss in some way and who have felt that the story helped them deal with their grief or change their relationship with grief,” Svedberg-Yen says.\n\n“What’s really cool is I’ve gotten tons of messages from creatives, writers, aspiring writers who felt creatively drained or just felt like they wanted to quit, but then the game inspired them to start again and they started creating their own art again, to start writing.”",

    "fullText": "The folks in Moneyglass are no strangers to cheering on one of their own on a big stage.\n\nWillie John McBride, who went on to star for the British and Irish Lions, was born in the small County Antrim village. So, too, was Grand National winner AP McCoy.\n\nNow, St Ergnat's are hoping to follow in their footsteps.\n\nIt has already been a memorable year for the club. After securing a fifth straight Antrim title, they conquered Ulster for the first time in November, beating Errigal Ciaran in the final.\n\nRuling the province was a realistic aim for Moneyglass this year, but few outside the squad - who are led by former Donegal ladies boss Maxi Curran - would have expected them to reach the All-Ireland final.\n\nBut they have gleefully defied expectations. Beating Dublin's Kilmacud Crokes in the semi-final a fortnight ago means they will become first Antrim side to grace the biggest stage in ladies club football at Croke Park on Saturday (16:00 GMT).\n\n\"Coming into this year, we just wanted to go a bit further than last year,\" says Aoife Kelly.\n\n\"Getting beaten in the semi-finals two years in a row, off the back of getting to the 2022 Ulster final, so the goal was to get back to the Ulster final, we got there, won it and we've been taking it game by game.\n\n\"It was no coincidence we won Ulster, we have been building to it for the last few years.\"",
