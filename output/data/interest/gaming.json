Gaming continued to take most of the top spots, as fans spent more time in interactive worlds that are constantly updated, like Minecraft and Terraria. In film and TV, long-running franchises like Star Wars and Marvel stayed near the top thanks to new releases like Andor and Thunderbolts.\n\nThe rankings were determined using Fandom's franchise factor score, which combines five things: worldbuilding, strong reviews, loyal fans, cultural impact, and consistency. It uses Fandom's large fan data to give a full picture of how popular and important a franchise is in entertainment and gaming.\n\nAnime also had a big year in large part because of high-profile films and celebrations. Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle brought huge attention as it moved the series toward its finale, while Chainsaw Man The Movie: Reze Arc kept momentum high between seasons. There was also the relative newcomer Dan Da Dan, which saw its second theatrical adaptation with Evil Eye.\n\nThe rankings also show a shift away from single launch moments toward steady output. According to Fandom's study, Roblox's top placement reflects how fans now prefer platforms with constant updates and community-created content. Smaller Roblox games, such as Dandy’s World and Grow a Garden, ranked higher than well-established worlds like Minecraft and Disney by focusing on frequent events and active, niche communities.\n\nThe same pattern appeared elsewhere with franchises such as Dungeons and Dragons and Cookie Run Kingdom performed well by releasing content regularly, showing that consistency mattered more than occasional peaks in attention.",

    "fullText": "SCOR, the interactive sports ecosystem, launched Fun.SCOR.io – a mobile and Web ecosystem.\n\nThe gaming firm has launched its much-awaited unified ecosystem across two chains for improved accessibility.\n\nThe native token SCOR is now live on OKX, Gate, and Bybit.\n\nIn the ever-evolving world of blockchain gaming, SCOR is making some notable moves that could shake up the landscape for sports fans and crypto enthusiasts alike.\n\nThey’ve just rolled out Fun.SCOR.io, a new web and mobile platform that serves as a one-stop shop for their extensive ecosystem of sports-themed mini-games.\n\nThe on-chain sports giant debuts its central web and mobile platform, empowering its massive player base with true wallet freedom via a simultaneous deployment on two major blockchains. The native token, SCOR, is now available on Bybit, OKX, and Gate.\n\nWith over 2 million active users already on board, it’s building on existing integrations in messaging apps and now providing players with a dedicated space to participate in tournaments, collect athlete characters, and prepare for PvP battles in the future.\n\nThe new web and mobile platform enables fans to play a variety of minigames with a pro sports theme, collect on-chain professional athlete characters, compete in tournaments, and soon participate in skill-based PvP challenges.\n\nTom Mizzone, Founder/CEO of Sweet, the developer of the SCOR ecosystem, said;\n\n“With the launch of Fun.SCOR.io, we are effectively opening the stadium doors to the broader Web3 world. A platform this size requires robust infrastructure, that is why we are going multichain on day one. By deploying on both Base and Mantle, we are ensuring our 2 million users enjoy a seamless, low-cost experience with true asset portability, regardless of which wallet or network they prefer.”\n\nThe real game-changer here is SCOR’s move to go multichain from day one, rolling out simultaneously on Base and Mantle.\n\nBase, the Ethereum Layer 2 from Coinbase, offers extremely low fees and lightning-fast transactions, making it ideal for high-volume trading. Mantle, with its modular design, adds another layer of scalability and efficiency.\n\nThe Fun.SCOR.io ecosystem launch provides gamers with a plethora of options, including the ability to connect any self-custody wallet on either chain. Thanks to the SCOR-ID system, gamers’ progress and assets flow seamlessly across both chains.\n\nFun.SCOR.io is now live, serving as the central hub destination for the ecosystem’s skill-based sports gaming.\n\nUsers can connect via their preferred self-custody wallets on either Base or Mantle, enjoying the specific benefits of each network.\n\nSCOR’s multi-chain play feels like a practical evolution toward more open and user-friendly Web3 sports experiences.\n\nWith such a strong user base already engaged, it could push the whole sector away from single-chain limitations and toward something truly interconnected. Exciting times are ahead for sports fans who are dipping into blockchain.\n\nThe post SCOR Launches Fun.SCOR.io as 2M-User Sports Ecosystem Goes Multichain on Base and Mantle appeared first on ccn.com.",

    "fullText": "With ​a blend of retro-futurism, moral ambiguity and monster-filled wastelands, Fallout became an unlikely prestige television favourite. Now there is something a bigger, stranger and funnier journey ahead\n\nDon’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? \nThe Fallout TV series returns to Prime Video today, and it’s fair to say that everyone was pleasantly surprised by how good the first season was. By portraying Fallout’s retro-futuristic, post-apocalyptic US through three different characters, it managed to capture different aspects of the game player’s experience, too. There was vault-dweller Lucy, trying to do the right thing and finding that the wasteland made that very difficult; Max, the Brotherhood of Steel rookie, who starts to question his cult’s authority and causes a lot of havoc in robotic power armour; and the Ghoul, Walton Goggins’s breakout character, who has long since lost any sense of morality out in the irradiated wilderness.\n\nThe show’s first season ended with a revelation about who helped cause the nuclear war that trapped a group of people in underground vaults for a couple of centuries. It also left plenty of questions open for the second season – and, this time, expectations are higher. Even being “not terrible” was a win for a video game adaptation until quite recently. How are the Fallout TV show’s creators feeling now that the first season has been a success?\n\n“We’ll take ‘not terrible’ – let’s get that on a poster,” says Jonah Nolan, the director who co-created the series with Geneva Robertson-Dworet. I’m speaking to them alongside Bethesda’s Todd Howard, director of the most recent Fallout video games. I last met with Nolan and Howard in 2024, before the first season premiered. Howard had been holding out a long time to make a Fallout adaptation, waiting for someone who seemed to really understand the series. Nolan, a lifelong player, was that person. Howard was poised with a red pen when he received the first script, but was relieved to find it was “fabulous”.\n\n“Going into the first season everyone’s like, ‘Just get it right’,” says Howard. “We’re over the moon with the reception to the show, so this time people are coming in with more excitement and different expectations.”\n\nThe second season is set in New Vegas, the site of 2010’s Fallout: New Vegas, which had the best writing and characters of any game in the series, even if it was a bit broken. The post-nuclear Strip was a kind of decaying criminal paradise full of warring factions and down-and-out inhabitants having as good a time as they can, given the bleak circumstances. It was shot in the real-world Nevada desert, and all over California. “It’s more of a desert vibe, a Mohave vibe, that’s so essential to that game,” says Nolan. “That dusty, blasted-out Route 66 vibe of the game is so much fun to bring into the show.”\n\nIn the show, a long time has passed since the events of the New Vegas game by the time Lucy and the Ghoul arrive in the city, but Howard says that it does reference the player’s journey. “When you’re doing a location that gamers know so well … honouring everyone’s journey through that game was a trick,” he says. “Time has moved on. What is New Vegas like now?… if you’re a fan of that game there’s so much to love in season two, visually and also with the factions and what’s going on with them.”\n\nThe Fallout TV series has a tactile feel – its creators ensured real props and sets were built, echoing the cobbled-together nature of the settlements in the games, where everyone is building stuff out of trash and every town is shoved together from whatever anyone can find. “As a sci-fi fan, so many shows I watch, I’m aware that they’re all standing in front of a blue screen,” says Robertson-Dworet. “The whole point of an adaptation, especially of a video game, is to feel like it’s real … of course, we still augment with VFX but, wherever possible, actors are actually standing in front of locations I loved seeing in the game.”\n\nIn fact, pretty much everything you see on-screen is real, even the infamously terrifying irradiated monsters, the Deathclaws. They were scary even as blobs of pixels in the original 90s Fallout games. In the show, they’re puppets, and apparently pretty frightening up close. “It was the closest look I’d ever gotten at a Deathclaw. In Fallout 4, whenever I saw one, it would instantly kill me,” laughs Nolan. “It was quite peculiar being able to stand there and stare at it.”\n\n“Even the radscorpion puppet was amazingly scary,” adds Robertson-Dworet. “It was so big – the mama scorp, that is. The little ones were fine, they were like overgrown lobsters, but it was genuinely very scary when the puppeteer was charging the big one at me.”\n\nThe Fallout series works because it’s made by talented film-makers who are also players and with the help of the people who created the actual games. Howard is replaying Red Dead Redemption 2 at the moment and resuming a long-dormant obsession with EA’s college (American) football games; Nolan has spent the summer playing Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom with his entire family; Robertson-Dworet is still working on scripts for the show, so she’s playing a lot of New Vegas (as is her husband).\n\n(Not everyone involved with the show is a gamer, though. In an interview with PC Gamer, Goggins the Ghoul said he had never played a Fallout game and had no intention of doing so. “No, I haven’t sat down to play the games. And I won’t. I won’t,” he said. “I won’t play the games. I’m not interested.” It’s OK, Walton, nobody is judging your gamer cred.)\n\nThe second season is coming out weekly rather than in one binge-able batch of episodes, so we will all be experiencing it differently from last season – including Howard, Nolan and Robertson-Dworet, who will now be looking out for people’s reactions every week.\n\n“It has more depth, it’s bigger, it’s funnier, it has a lot of surprises,” says Howard. “I’m looking forward to seeing what people think.”\n\nSwedish developer Simogo made some of the most interesting iPhone and iPad games of the 2010s, from the unforgettable puzzle game Device 6 to the eerie Year Walk. It recently released a compilation of these games, an attempt to preserve them before they are either removed from mobile storefronts or become unplayable thanks to iOS updates.\n\nAvailable on: Nintendo Switch/Switch 2, PC\n\n Estimated playtime: 5-plus hours\n\nThe Game awards took place last week, a typically brisk affair at just under four hours. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 won nine awards, including Game of the Year, kicking off a predictable online discussion about whether it is even that good. See the full list of winners here, a rundown of the most notable trailers and announcements here, and look out for the Guardian’s games of the year list on Friday.\n\nLara Croft is back for two new Tomb Raider games, starring the self-assured version of the tank-topped action heroine from the 1990s. The first game, Catalyst, is a new adventure set in northern India, out 2027; next year we’ll see Legacy of Atlantis, a ground-up remake of the very first Tomb Raider game.\n\nGood news for our young and sprightly readers: the Quickshot II, the legendary joystick beloved of many Amiga and C64 players, is making a comeback in January. It will work with anything with a USB slot, including all the recent modern reissues of Amiga, Commodore and Spectrum home computers.\n\n‘Our industry has been strip-mined’: video game workers protest at the Game awards\n\nRockstar co-founder Dan Houser on life after Grand Theft Auto\n\nBluey’s Quest for the Gold Pen: after some misfires, we finally have the first good Bluey video game\n\n‘If we build it, they will come’: Skövde, the tiny town powering up Sweden’s video game boom\n\nClair Obscur: Expedition 33 – how a tiny studio developed the Belle Époque-set gaming blockbuster\n\nFallout season two – this post-apocalyptic thriller is absolutely hilarious | ★★★★☆\n\nOmniscient Reader: The Prophecy – life gets gamified in one-note Korean sci-fi | ★★☆☆☆\n\n“We love games we can play as a pair, whether they are designed as single-player (eg Blue Prince) or multiplayer (eg For the King, Gloomhaven, Sunderfolk). Puzzle games and turn-based games seem to work particularly well. Do you have any suggestions for something to try next?”\n\nWe’ve answered a few variations of this question before, but as it’s Christmas, I suspect that plenty of people will be looking for something to play while cosied up on the sofa – so here are some fresh recommendations for local multiplayer and pad-passing games. If you like a challenge, Absolum is a punishing but stylish fusion of beat-em-up and adventure game. Powerwash Simulator 2 lets you soothingly scrub down filthy objects together. For nominally single-player games, narrative games often make good pad-passers; Lost Records: Bloom and Rage and Dispatch are two of the year’s best. You might want to try trading attempts at Baby Steps, the year’s most infuriating game. And my partner enjoyed taking turns at Ball x Pit, the fiendishly compelling game where you defeat demonic hordes with magic ping-pong balls.\n\nIf you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – hit reply or email us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.",

    "fullText": "If I could use only one word to encapsulate Terminator 2D: No Fate, it would be \"authentic\": Both in the way it faithfully recreates James Cameron's seminal 1991 action movie and its nostalgic love affair with the 16-bit era of video games. Movie tie-ins were mostly awful in the early '90s, but I could easily see myself renting No Fate from my local Blockbuster and blasting through its sidescrolling run-'n'-gun action in between episodes of Dragon Ball Z and WWF Smackdown.\n\nIt's a brief experience, with the credits arriving in less time than it takes to watch the entirety of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, but No Fate is a licensed video game done right, created with palpable reverence for both its source material and the era of video games it emulates.\n\nNo Fate's story mode opens with a shot of rolling tarmac, as the painted yellow lines in the middle of the road scroll past at regular intervals. If you're a fan of Terminator 2, this shot will be a familiar sight, albeit one now rendered in gorgeous pixel art, with chiptune music and Sarah Connor's monologue presented as blocks of text rather than through Linda Hamilton's hushed tones. It's also in a different place--on a desert road instead of a Los Angeles freeway--and opens the game as opposed to bookending the movie.\n\nWhere it once wrapped up two hours of pure movie-making excellence with a hopeful glimpse of an undetermined and hopefully better future, No Fate warns of the horrors to come--of Judgment Day and the rise of the machines. It's a scene that wonderfully captures the vibe of Terminator 2 while also putting developer Bitmap Bureau's own spin on things, remaining authentic and faithful to the source material with an additional sprinkling of unique flavor on top.\n\nThis is a common theme throughout No Fate's story mode. When it's not a beat-by-beat 16-bit recreation of one of the greatest movies ever made, it's filling in the blanks and professing its love for '90s gaming, fluidly shifting gameplay styles to suit the adaptation's needs.\n\nTake the opening level as a prime example: In a new scene set shortly before the film's events, Sarah is teaching John Connor how to fight so he can become the soldier he may need to be in the future. This moment of atypical bonding is interrupted when a musclebound thug pays homage to Double Dragon by punching John in the gut and flinging him over his shoulder before walking off. What follows is a side-scrolling action platformer with more than a few similarities to the console and early arcade games of the '90s.\n\nAs you move Sarah from left to right, mowing down bad guys by shooting vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, games like Metal Slug, Super Star Wars, and RoboCop Versus The Terminator come to mind. Movement is responsive, and human enemies go down in a couple of shots, making for some satisfyingly fast-paced action.\n\nAfter rescuing John, Sarah heads to a Cyberdyne research lab to destroy it, only to be shot, arrested, and sent to the Pescadero mental hospital: a moment mentioned briefly in the film but afforded more prominence here. With Sarah's plans to prevent Judgment Day foiled, No Fate takes inspiration from Terminator 2's explosive opening scene, putting you in control of a grizzled John Connor as he leads the resistance in the Future War of 2029.\n\nThese levels resemble Konami's Contra series more than anything, right down to a familiar defensive wall boss fight and temporary weapon pickups that grant homing plasma rounds and split shot fire. Bitmap Bureau introduces a few modern wrinkles as well, such as the ability to take cover and an evasive roll for avoiding enemy fire, though the game gets more interesting once you're done destroying the various T-800s, Centurions, and Hunter-Killers of Los Angeles' future.\n\nOnce John reaches the time-travel device and sends a T-800 back to 1995, No Fate transitions to Arnold Schwarzenegger's first appearance in Terminator 2 as he emerges in the parking lot of The Corral biker bar--though it's worth noting that Arnie's likeness isn't included, despite Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong, and Robert Patrick all starring. From here, the game begins taking scenes from the film and transforming them into playable levels, nailing every memorable moment while adapting gameplay styles to fit each scene.\n\nAfter a naked Arnie asks for a biker's clothes, boots, and motorcycle, No Fate momentarily turns into a beat-em-up as you clobber The Corral's patrons, throwing one onto a steaming hot grill and culminating in a boss fight set to George Thorogood's \"Bad to the Bone.\"\n\nLater on, the iconic motorcycle/truck pursuit through Los Angeles' flood-control channel draws inspiration from Battletoads' Turbo Tunnel and the bike level from Contra 3: The Alien Wars, challenging you to avoid static hazards while keeping Robert Patrick's T-1000 at bay--complete with one-handed shotgun reloads that are still the coolest. The freeway chase from later on in the film functions similarly but differs slightly, as you alternate between weaving in and out of traffic and taking control of Sarah as she fires upon the pursuing T-1000-manned helicopter.\n\nSarah's escape from the Pescadero Hospital is another highlight, briefly turning No Fate into a stealth game. With the T-1000 hot on your tail, passing through metal bars and melting into the floor, there's a sudden injection of tension since you have no way of fighting back. Instead, you need to duck into doorways and various alcoves to avoid the T-1000 and bide your time before taking out the hospital's abusive orderlies. There isn't an instant fail state if you alert any of the human enemies; it's just easier to take them out with a swift blow to the back of the head, so being spotted is never frustrating.\n\nThis level fits the era, too, even if you might not necessarily think of stealth mechanics when recalling 16-bit games. 1990's Bonanza Bros was the primary inspiration behind No Fate's stealth mechanics, but games like Rolling Thunder and Elevator Action Returns were also influential, showcasing the depth of Bitmap Bureau's love for the era.\n\nWhile your first venture through No Fate's story mode covers the rest of Terminator 2, from blowing up Cyberdyne HQ to fighting off the T-1000 in the steel mill finale, subsequent playthroughs allow you to change the future. After all, the game's title comes from the famous line \"there's no fate but what we make for ourselves.\" The future isn't predetermined, and so the game leans into this ethos, letting you make a couple of different choices to alter events and unlock three alternative endings.\n\nIn practice, however, this sounds more interesting than it actually is. The branching paths introduce a few new levels, including an escape from a police station that feels like an ode to the original 1984 Terminator, but the other endings are brief and, much like the ending in the film's extended cut, can't compare to the original.\n\nAlong with a ranking system, global leaderboards, multiple difficulty settings, and other unlockable modes, seeking out the other three endings adds some replayability to what is otherwise a remarkably short game. My first playthrough took 42 minutes, with that number decreasing with each subsequent completion. The other modes include a Boss Rush, where you try to defeat all of the game's bosses as quickly as possible, and an Infinite mode that tasks you with walking down an endless corridor, killing as many enemies as you can to achieve the highest score. If you're interested in leaderboards, you might get some longevity out of these modes, but otherwise, you'll likely play each of them once just to unlock the rest of the modes.\n\nArcade mode adds an extra challenge by removing continues, while Mother of the Future condenses the story mode to only Sarah Connor's levels, with completion unlocking the hardest difficulty setting. The options are nice, but still just offer different ways to replay the same game. No Fate's brevity is fitting for a time period where most games had to be finished in a single sitting, but if you have no intention of elongating the experience by unlocking every mode, it's unlikely you'll be completely fulfilled.\n\nThose with few qualms about duration will find a game made with evident love and affection for both the source material and the moment in time it was released. Its music is excellent--with perhaps the best rendition of the Terminator 2 theme to date--aiding the game's visuals in its mission to transport you back to a time when blowing into cartridges and inserting coins were the norm. Whether it's the T-1000's haunting fluidity of movement, Sarah Connor's one-armed reloading of a pump action shotgun, or the way the T-800 clambers onto the hood of a semi-truck to unload an entire magazine into its windshield, Terminator 2D: No Fate recreates the movie's most memorable moments with pitch-perfect authenticity. It's a shame it ends far too soon, but this is still the definitive Terminator 2 video game.",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Several dozen people protested on Sunday in the Siberian city of Tomsk against Russia's ban on U.S. children's gaming platform Roblox, ​a rare show of public dissent as popular irritation over the ban gains ‌some momentum.\n\nIn wartime Russia, censorship is extensive: Moscow blocks or restricts social media platforms such as Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp ‌and YouTube while distributing its own narrative through a network of social media and Russian media.\n\nRussia's communications watchdog Roskomnadzor said on December 3 it had blocked Roblox because it was \"rife with inappropriate content that can negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children\".\n\nIn Tomsk, 2,900 km (1,800 miles) east ⁠of Moscow, several dozen people braved ‌the snow to hold up hand-drawn placards reading \"Hands off Roblox\" and \"Roblox is the victim of the digital Iron Curtain\" in Vladimir Vysotsky Park, according ‍to photographs provided by an organiser of the protest.\n\n\"Bans and blocks are all you are able to do,\" read one placard. The photographs showed about 25 people standing in a circle in the snow, holding up ​placards.\n\nIn Russia, the ban on Roblox has triggered a debate over censorship, child safety in ‌relation to technology and even the effectiveness of censorship in a digitalised world where children can bypass many bans in a few clicks.\n\nMany Russians simply circumvent bans by using VPNs (Virtual Private Networks), though some young Russians have questioned the logic of a ban if it can be so easily bypassed while others have questioned why there are so few Russian alternatives to the ⁠apps which the state has banned.\n\nSome Russian parents and ​teachers have said they were concerned Roblox allowed children ​to access sexual content and communicate with adults.\n\nRoblox, headquartered in San Mateo, California, has been banned by several countries including Iraq and Turkey over concerns about ‍predators exploiting the platform ⁠to abuse children.\n\nThe company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. When the Russian ban was introduced, Roblox said it has \"a deep commitment to safety\" and provides \"rigorous ⁠built-in protections to help keep users safe\".\n\nRussian officials say they need censorship to defend against a sophisticated \"information war\" unleashed ‌by Western powers, and what they cast as decadent Western culture which undermines \"traditional\" ‌Russian values.",

    "fullText": "He rewrote the rule book with Rockstar then left it all behind. Now Dan Houser is back with a storytelling-focused studio to take on AI-obsessed tech bros and Mexican beauty queens\n\nThere are only a handful of video game makers who have had as profound an effect on the industry as Dan Houser. The co-founder of Rockstar Games, and its lead writer, worked on all the GTA titles since the groundbreaking third instalment, as well as both Red Dead Redemption adventures. But then, in 2019, he took an extended break from the company which ended with his official departure. Now he’s back with a new studio and a range of projects, and 12 years after we last interviewed him, he’s ready to talk about what comes next.\n\n“Finishing those big projects and thinking about doing another one is really intense,” he says about his decision to go. “I’d been in full production mode every single day from the very start of each project to the very end, for 20 years. I stayed so long because I loved the games. It was a real privilege to be there, but it was probably the right time to leave. I turned 45 just after Red Dead 2 came out. I thought, well, it’s probably a good time to try working on some other stuff.”\n\nAt first, he looked into film or TV writing, but didn’t like what he found. “That world was not overly excited by me and I was not overly excited by them,” he says. “I’ve spent 20 years talking about how games are the coming medium and now they are the medium […] you look at TV and the budgets and the amount of money they can generate, but the creative ambition is so small at times”. It seemed to Houser that it would be easier to come at the industry with IP that had already been generated. So he moved to Santa Monica and formed Absurd Ventures, bringing in Greg Borrud (founder of Seismic Games and Pandemic Studios) as head of games and, as COO, Wendy Smith, previously at the New Yorker and Ralph Lauren, and a White House special assistant during Bill Clinton’s presidency.\n\nIt was clear from the start it wouldn’t just be a video games studio. In 2024, the company released the 12-part story podcast A Better Paradise, a dystopian thriller about an ambitious online game world overseen by a powerful AI presence that begins to become sentient – with devastating consequences. Its creator is the mysterious tech billionaire Dr Mark Tyburn, a British inventor who intends the game as a digital utopia, then abandons it when things go awry. In some ways it is a satire on our current digital oligarchy, in which billionaire tech bros wield astronomical influence over society.\n\n“All of these tech companies start out with grandiose ambitions, this ‘we are going to save the world through togetherness’-type gibberish,” he says. “We’ve created some of the most powerful people in history in terms of reach and mind control. Those people end up living with far more money than anyone’s ever had. And it feels, as someone who lives in the society that they have helped create, that there are moments in those journeys when they must have felt their product was not quite what they intended it to be and was doing unforeseen harm, and … they went out of their way to ensure that was not regulated. That Faustian moment I find fascinating, and that’s not to say I wouldn’t make the same choice or judge them for it, I just find it interesting.”\n\nTellingly perhaps, the company at the centre of A Better Paradise, Tyburn Industria, feels much more like a games studio than a social media mega-corp. Also, the lead protagonist is a writer who finds himself at the centre of the game’s development. Is there an element of autobiography here?\n\n“Yeah, of course – at that level,” says Houser. “But I also wanted to write about games and tech in a way that felt authentic. To lean slightly more into the games side in terms of the office environment was really easy for me. I know what it’s like to work in a games company obviously. I wanted to try and bring that to life in a way that felt real and to capture some of the micro dramas.”\n\nHaving turned A Better Paradise into a novel, Houser’s Santa Monica studio is now working on an open-world video game version. He’s not saying how it will fit in with the podcast, just that Mark Tyburn and the AI at the heart of his game, NigelDave (a wildly intelligent program, fixated by humans but with no understanding of how they function), will both figure in the action.\n\nAlso in development at the company’s second studio in San Rafael, is the Absurdaverse, a comedy universe populated by a menagerie of weird characters, from a skeletal warrior to an ageing hippy. The company is planning a series of animated TV shows and/or movies for the concept, but also another open world game, which Houser has described as, “a living sitcom”. Again, he’s vague on the details, but it looks to be a more story-driven take on The Sims, possibly utilising AI to create emergent narratives around the characters and their lives. “We’re trying to use the memories of NPCs in a fun way,” he says. “Just trying to make it a bit more alive. You’ll see when we talk about it more, but it is shaping up really well. It’s a completely gamey game – very mechanics driven. With both games, we’re trying to make them really strong on mechanics, really fun to play, accessible, but plenty of depth.”\n\nHouser is also planning a game around the company’s third IP, the comic book series American Caper, co-written with fellow Rockstar alumnus, Lazlow. With its cast of escaped convicts, crooked lawyers and Mexican beauty queens, it is perhaps the closest out of all his new projects to Grand Theft Auto. Which is perhaps why the interactive version is going in a different direction. “I’m not making an open-world game for that,” says Houser. “We’re actually looking at maybe doing more of a story game. We’re still kind of exploring it.”\n\nWe talk a little bit about the current prevalence of forever games such as Minecraft, Fortnite and Roblox and how they’re sucking up a lot of the world’s playtime. But Houser is adamant that there’s still a vast audience for mature single-player narrative experiences – and that’s what he’s aiming at.\n\n“We’re trying to be ambitious, to make new stuff,” he says. “At some level [our projects] are traditional console games, accessible, but action-oriented story-driven open world console games – but then at the same time, we’re doing it a slightly different way or with slightly different subject matter. Three years ago we were watching one of those PlayStation showcases, and if you blinked and missed the credit sequences, you couldn’t tell where one game ended and the other began. Everything was sort of dark purple and about space ninjas. They were about this apocalypse or that apocalypse but always felt the same.”\n\n“That’s fine. Some of them are amazing games. But we were like, well, we’ve got limited money and we are starting from scratch. We have to have good stories and fun dialogue, and make sure our gameplay is amazing and accessible, and our art direction has to be fresh – at all points, it has to feel different. We have to make stuff where people go, ‘Well, I’ve never played a game about that’, and then treat the audience, not just as gamers, but as human beings.”\n\nSo he’s not worried about the industry’s current obsession with live-service multiplayer mega-games? “I still think there is enough of an audience who want new stuff and single player-led stuff,” he says. And then in his characteristically self-deprecating way he adds: “I hope so. Or we’re in a little bit of trouble.”",

As part of the State of Play for First Light, Gibson was officially confirmed while five other cast members were revealed.\n\nOne role that is currently unrevealed is the game's nemesis, 009. This former MI6 agent is being hunted by Bond and his allies, but the extent of 009's ambitions are unclear.\n\nIO Interactive was more forthcoming about other aspects of the game, which we included in our recap of everything we learned about 007: First Light. The publisher also unveiled multiple editions of the game, which you can find in our First Light preorder guide.\n\n007 First Light will hit PC, PlayStation 5, Switch 2, and Xbox Series X|S on March 27, 2026. You can find all of the currently announced cast members below.\n\nPatrick Gibson is making his video game debut as the voice and likeness of James Bond in 007 First Light. In the absence of a 007 actor on the big screen, he's the incumbent Bond for the moment.\n\nGibson recently had one of his biggest roles to date as young Dexter Morgan in Dexter: Original Sin. Prior to that, he had leading roles on Netflix's Shadow and Bone and The OA. One of Gibson's earliest acting credits was in Showtime's The Tudors. On the big screen, Gibson has appeared in a handful of movies including the 2019 J.R.R. Tolkien biopic, Tolkien.\n\nPriyanga Burford had a small role in the last Bond movie as a MI6 scientist in No Time To Die. She has a considerably bigger part as M in 007 First Light.\n\nBurford's credits are primarily in television, and she had leading and supporting roles in Steeltown Murders, Before We Die, Avenue 5, Industry, Housebound, and Press.\n\nThe Walking Dead and Fear the Walking Dead fans will surely recognize Lennie James, who portrayed Morgan Jones across both series. In First Light, James will play Bond's mentor, John Greenway.\n\nJames has also lent his voice to the Destiny games, where he portrayed Lord Shaxx. The English actor has a long list of credits across TV and film, including Blade Runner 2049, Human Target, Invincible, Archer, Jericho, and Mufasa: The Lion King.\n\nKiera Lester is a relative newcomer to the entertainment industry, with only a handful of television credits to her name. She has appeared in Sister Boniface Mysteries, Wreck, Ruby Speaking, Grace, and Death in Paradise.\n\nLester's role as Miss Moneypenny in 007 First Light will be one of her most prominent parts to date.\n\nVeteran actor Alastair Mackenzie will voice Q, the man who creates all of Bond's incredible gadgets. We don't know yet how Mackenzie's take on the character will differ from his on-screen predecessors. But unlike the last Q, Ben Whishaw, Mackenzie is considerably older than the actor playing Bond.\n\nAndor fans may recognize Mackenzie from his role as Perrin Fertha, the husband on Mon Mothma. Some of his other credits include The Crown, Dracula, Unforgotten, Outlaw King, and Backdraft 2.\n\nWho is Miss Roth? She appears to be the femme fatale Bond girl in 007 First Light. Noemie Nakai will lend her voice and likeness to Miss Roth in the game.\n\nNakai's most prominent TV role was in HBO Max's Tokyo Vice, and her other credits include Army of Thieves, Never Let Me Go, The Emperor's Cook, and Death Note: New Generation.\n\nBritish actress Gemma Chan--known for her roles in Transformers: The Last Knight, Crazy Rich Asians, and Captain Marvel--will appear in First Light as the character Selina Tan.\n\nShe's described as a \"brilliant and passionate academic with a background in psychology and game theory.\" The character, who works at MI6, played a \"critical role\" in helping James Bond earn his 00 status.\n\nThis is not Chan's first video game role, as she also portrayed Erys in Diablo IV. Chan lent her voice and likeness to 007 First Light.\n\nMusician and actor Lenny Kravitz will play the villain Bawma.",

    "fullText": "What started as Guillaume Broche’s personal project has been nominated for 12 Game awards, sold more than 2m copies and been praised by Emmanuel Macron as a ‘shining example of French audacity’\n\nThe record-breaking 12 nominations at the Game awards this year was beyond the wildest dreams of Guillaume Broche when he first began inking out Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 as a personal project while working at Ubisoft.\n\nBefore selling more than 2m copies, the narrative-driven roleplaying game with “a unique world, challenging combat and great writing” was a technical demo called We Lost. It was Broche’s appetite for risk and a few hopeful Reddit posts that would create the game’s world of Lumiere and its struggle against the Paintress.\n\n“I was doing like eight hours per day after work and not sleeping at all for a few years,” Broche says. And while he would be joined by Tom Guillermin on the programming side and Francoise Meurisse as producer, the next few members of the nascent studio – Lorien Testard, lead composer and Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, lead writer – would only come to Clair Obscur by chance, via social media.\n\nTestard, a guitar teacher at the time who had never composed or published any music commerically, was discovered by Broche on SoundCloud. “We liked the same philosophy in games,” says Testard, who had been writing music inspired by his favourite titles. Similarly, Broche found his art director, Nicholas Maxson-Francombe, through personal works he posted on ArtStation. “We are all deeply engaged in our subject areas,” says Svedberg-Yen, who says that was what bonded the team together. “If you listen to Nicolas talk about art or Lorien talk about music, it’s just something that fills our minds and our days.”\n\nSvedberg-Yen, meanwhile, had come from the world of finance. She saw Broche’s Reddit post and auditioned to not only write but also to voice some of the prototype characters of Clair Obscur, namely Maelle and Lune. Despite a deep love for video games, storytelling and a childhood engrossed in novels, Svedberg-Yen had not considered it as a career option. “It never crossed my mind as possible. As the adage goes, for Asian parents [it’s] doctors, lawyers, or finance.”\n\nWith a rudimentary team assembled under the banner of a new studio, Sandfall Interactive, they rebooted We Lost as Clair Obscur. It was there a world took shape and the gained its unmistakeable Belle Époque setting. “There’s a specificity,” Svedberg-Yens says. “I think that vision gets diluted when you’re trying to appeal to too many people.”\n\n“It’s not meant to be French propaganda,” jokes Broche, about the game’s very Gallic aesthetic. The characters yell putain and merde, there are berets and extremely scary mimes not only because it’s fun, he says, but born from a desire to make something “sincere and authentic”.\n\nSame goes for the story. Clair Obscur’s narrative drives the game forward and, as lead writer, Svedberg-Yen says it all has a “grounding and a basis in truth”.\n\n“We are all first-time writer and game developers in this sense … and so we kind of only know instinctively how write to what instinctively comes from within. And for a lot of the characters in those particular situations, to write them [you] have to really delve into the parts of my life that resonate with the situation that they’re in.”\n\nAccording to Svedberg-Yen, a conversation Broche had with his mother became core to the story’s emotional heft. When he asked her what would be the worst thing that could possibly happen, his mother responded saying it would be to lose her children. “The story deals with a lot of trauma,” she says, and that process of writing like that was often a scary process. “If people don’t like it, they don’t like you.” It was this ability to be vulnerable and open a communicative environment that Broche believes contributed to the success of the game.\n\nDespite an anxiety in the industry about the rise of AI in the development of video games, the team at Sandfall isn’t worried – especially Testard, who composed the game’s orchestral score based off the narrative beats of the game and the eponymous concept of clair obscur (or chiaroscuro), AKA the interplay of light and dark. “Music is the language of the soul,” he says. In fact, the evolution of technology like Unreal Engine 4 and the later 5, which the game runs on today, made a lot of the game possible. “More games will be 3D, because we have a lot of tools now,” says Broche, who describes the budget of his game to be on the “lower end of AA.”\n\nThe team at Sandfall have been overwhelmed by their success. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, lauded the game as “shining example of French audacity”. None of them expected the experience of Clair Obscur to resonate so deeply with so many people. “I’ve gotten a lot of very heartfelt messages from players who have experienced loss in some way and who have felt that the story helped them deal with their grief or change their relationship with grief,” Svedberg-Yen says.\n\n“What’s really cool is I’ve gotten tons of messages from creatives, writers, aspiring writers who felt creatively drained or just felt like they wanted to quit, but then the game inspired them to start again and they started creating their own art again, to start writing.”",

    "description": "How to actually get games on your brand new Linux or Android gaming device.",
    "fullText": "I recently put together a list of the best small portable gaming handhelds for people who are tired of how big the Nintendo Switch 2 and handheld gaming PCs like the Steam Deck are. In an era of gaming devices that often feel like laptops with grips and buttons added to them, these retro gaming handhelds (as I call them) can be a great solution for people who miss the days of the PSP and Nintendo DS. But since they come from smaller companies, and run either Linux or Android, actually getting games on these devices is not quite so straightforward. After all, it's not like the people making these handhelds are publishing cartridges for them.\n\nWhile that's true, there are plenty of ways to play games both new and old on these devices, even if they were originally made for other consoles. And despite a reputation to the contrary, if you do them right, they're all legal.\n\nEmulation is a common use for retro gaming handhelds, to the point where some people just call them emulators. It isn’t the only thing you can do with these devices, but it’s definitely a popular way to put games on them, especially the weaker ones.\n\nThrough emulation, your system can mimic older devices like the Game Boy, Super Nintendo, and PlayStation 1, to play games originally released for those platforms. This works by using your modern device’s more powerful hardware to run software that virtually recreates all the processes of old consoles, making older games think they’re running on the real thing. This is in comparison to games that “run natively,” meaning they’re running on the system they were built for. Emulators developed by fans are well-known, but even large companies like Nintendo use emulation. In fact, the games you play on Nintendo Switch Online are technically all emulated.\n\nThis can come with downsides. You might run into minor inaccuracies in sound or graphics, but typically, the more powerful your device’s chip and the weaker the system you’re emulating, the less common these will be. You could also experience input lag, although I’ve never once been able to actually feel it across most of the devices I’ve used to emulate. (I say this as someone who has beaten all three of the original Ninja Gaiden games using emulation.)\n\nAnd there are upsides to emulation, too. Games can be upscaled to push out higher resolutions than ever intended natively, which can make for homebrew HD remasters if played on a nice enough screen. And most emulation programs support save states, which let you save your progress anywhere, anytime, separate from a specific game’s built-in save system. Save states can be a lifesaver for especially difficult games, or while playing on the go.\n\nThe biggest hurdle, then, is setup. Some devices come with emulators built in, although you'll probably want to configure them to your specifications, and if you're on a Linux-based handheld, possibly run them alongside a custom, third-party firmware (more on that later).\n\nSpecifics will vary from device to device, so for help, I suggest YouTuber Russ Crandall's guides on emulation. Crandall runs the channel Retro Game Corps, and has been a big help in my own emulation journey. He's also exhaustively catalogued the steps you'll need to go through for various handhelds.\n\nTruth be told, though, you'll probably be using similar programs across your handhelds. RetroArch is popular for emulating older systems, while newer ones require specific apps like Dolphin (for GameCube and Wii) or PPSSPP (for PSP). After you've set these up once, doing it for other handhelds is kind of like riding a bike. The biggest difficulty you’ll probably encounter will be providing ROM files for your emulators, which leads me to the elephant in the room.\n\nEmulation is convenient, and a great way to experience games that haven’t been re-released for modern consoles. But it also has a bit of a reputation for being shady. For comment, I reached out to YouTube Bob Wulff of Wulff Den, another mainstay in guides and reviews for retro gaming handhelds. Ultimately, Wulff thinks this reputation is undeserved.\n\n“I don’t like this stigma that Emulation [equals] Piracy,” he told me. “There are plenty of ways to acquire your ROMs legally.”\n\nAnd therein lies the rub. When people think that emulation is illegal, they’re usually conflating emulator programs with pirated game files, or ROMs. The process of writing original software to mimic a console’s function is actually perfectly legal, to the point where Apple now allows emulators on the App Store, but distributing copyrighted software to run on those emulators is where you get into legal issues. That’s why handheld companies like Anbernic have a bit of a bad reputation for including ROMs with their devices, as I highlight in my list of the best retro gaming handhelds. But theoretically, if you legally own a game, U.S. law allows you to make your own backup of it, which you could then play on an emulator without issue. Unless you’re downloading your games off pirate sites or buying SD cards with pirated ROMs pre-loaded onto them, playing games using an emulator shouldn't be any different in the eyes of the law than playing games on original hardware.\n\nAs for how you can actually get your own legal backups of games you own, there are a number of devices that will read your cartridges and back up their ROM files for you, as well as PC programs that will do the same thing for disc-based games. Also note that you can emulate on phones and PCs, too, although there is a certain magic in emulating using a small handheld with controls built-in.\n\nBut as much as some fans like to call retro gaming handhelds “emulators” and leave it at that, these devices can do more than mimic old consoles. The hardware for these devices is usually versatile enough to support playing modern games natively, streaming games from the cloud, or in some cases, even playing games originally meant for PC. You can play new games on these handhelds, too. Let's start with Android and cloud gaming, as they're among the simplest ways to get games on these devices.\n\nThis is the obvious one. If your retro gaming handheld runs Android, then it stands to reason that it can run Android apps. This means that in addition to emulation, you can play phone games like Genshin Impact or Call of Duty Mobile. Your device's built-in controller will work with the game like any standard phone controller, and you’ll be able to play just as well as anyone on a phone could. Android-based gaming handhelds also come with touchscreens, so you shouldn’t run into problems if your game needs one. The only catch is that some devices with a square-ish aspect ratio might use a lot of letterboxing to actually show anything other than retro games on-screen, which could make for a tiny image (they'll be great for old, 4:3 games, though). Otherwise, know that the Play Store is your oyster.\n\nIf your retro gaming handheld has Android installed on it, then you can also use it to stream games from the cloud. That means you could connect it to either your own home console, your PC, or a subscription service to play games that your device isn’t able to run on its own, or that you don’t want to install to it. The only issues you’ll face will be potential input lag and video compression, plus the need for a constant internet connection. But given that Sony sells a whole handheld built entirely around Remote Play, it’s great to have it as an option on these devices, while knowing that they can also play games on their own power, too. It’s an especially great choice for turn-based games, or other titles that don’t require twitchy, fast-paced inputs.\n\nThis is a more recent innovation, but there are currently two ways to play PC games on your retro gaming handheld without relying on the cloud. One runs them natively, and one uses technology similar to the Steam Deck’s.\n\nThe first method is for retro gaming handhelds that run Linux. These are usually the cheaper devices, the type you’ll get from companies like Anbernic or Miyoo. The version of Linux on these isn’t the same as on handhelds like the Steam Deck, so don’t expect to just be able to log into your Steam account with these and go off to the races. But thanks to the fan-made program Portmaster, you can still play some of your Steam games on these handhelds.\n\nPortmaster connects you with fan-made ports of PC games built to run natively on your retro gaming handheld. Some of these are freeware, and some will need you to plug in files from your own Steam installs to avoid violating copyright. But both types of games can be up-and-running in just a few steps, and like with emulation, Crandall has a guide to help get you started on your particular device.\n\nThe big caveat here is that, to get Portmaster, you'll probably need to install a third-party firmware, also fan-made, to your device, rather than using what comes with it out of the box. I use muOS, but if you want something with a different style, there are other options, depending on your device. Since there's so much variation, I haven't personally tested all options, but Crandall again has you covered.\n\nYou’ll also mostly be stuck with retro and lightweight games using this method, but there's an upside to that, too. I’ve already used it to help get through the indie darlings in my Steam back catalog, like Undertale.\n\nThe second method is for devices that run Android. Much like the Steam Deck uses real-time compatibility layers to convert Windows games to run on its version of Linux, there are now Android apps that can help you run your Steam games on either your phone or your retro gaming handheld.\n\nThe three popular ones are called GameHub, GameHub Lite, and GameNative. These programs add extra configuration and user friendliness on top of an existing app called WinLator, a compatibility layer that allows Windows programs to run on Android. You can log right into your Steam account using these apps, then download your games and play them on your Android handheld, complete with cloud saves. You’ll still be limited in what you can play, based on what’s had the most compatibility work put into it, but it’s great for lightweight games, older AAA games, and if your handheld is powerful enough (think the AYN Odin 3), even more recent AAA games from the PS4 era.\n\n“These Windows containers are really exciting,” Crandall told me when I reached out for comment. “I don’t think they are anywhere close to replacing a PC, but it’s exciting to get a lightweight PC game running nicely on a smaller handheld.”\n\nThat said, there are a few concerns with using these apps. While Gamenative is open source, and GameHub Lite is an independent fork of GameHub that tries to fix its issues, GameHub will likely be the easiest app for most people to use, as it has the simplest interface and the most compatibility updates for various games. Unfortunately, it comes with a number of privacy concerns.\n\nGamehub is made by controller company GameSir, which has made reputable products in the past, but it does want you to log into a GameSir account to use it, and some users might be uncomfortable linking their Steam data to that. It also includes, in Crandall’s words, “some fairly intrusive telemetry permissions.”\n\nHowever, both Crandall and Wulff are ultimately positive enough on GameHub.\n\n“It’s frankly no more nosy than any of the various social media apps we already have on our phones,” Crandall told me, also saying that if you’re uncomfortable logging in with a GameSir account, you can use “a Steam login token via QR code,” which should be more secure.\n\nWulff, meanwhile, said “I don’t personally think there are any potential security issues with GameHub,” citing GameSir’s reputation and saying “I also just don’t think our Steam data is worth a damn.”\n\nI see where both creators are coming from, but I have been a bit more cautious on this front. Still, it’s an enticing option if you’re willing to try it out, and it actually points to things to come. Recently, Valve announced its Steam Frame VR headset, which runs on the same type of framework that Android phones do. With that, retro gaming handheld enthusiasts are hopeful Valve will soon release an official way to play Steam games on these devices (and phones). That's something the company recently hinted at in an interview with The Verge, saying it has been quietly bankrolling much of the development on the compatibility layers that apps like WinLator and its derivatives use.\n\nOn that note, if you’re brave, you could also just play your PC games on these devices using WinLator itself, or other alternatives like Pluvia. However, these have been too complex for me to fiddle with, and I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone but the most hardcore tinkerers. I think I’m with Crandall in saying that “I’d much rather have a proper Steam-derived solution.” Fingers-crossed.",

    "fullText": "Sam Eng/Devolver Digital, PC, PS5, Switch 2\nAn exquisitely fluid game of tricks, grinds and manuals is framed by a story that uncovers the poignancy of the infamously painful pastime\n\nSkateboarding video games live and die by their vibe. The original Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater titles were anarchic, arcade fun while the recent return of EA’s beloved Skate franchise offered competent yet jarringly corporate realism. Skate Story, which is mostly the work of solo developer Sam Eng, offers a more impressionistic interpretation while capturing something of the sport’s essential spirit. It transposes the boarding action to a demonic underworld where the aesthetic is less fire and brimstone than glittering, 2010s-era vaporwave. It is also the most emotionally real a skateboarding game has ever felt.\n\nThe premise is ingenious: you are a demon made out of “pain and glass”. Skate to the moon and swallow it, says the devil, and you shall be freed. So that is exactly what you do. You learn to ollie first, a “delicate, precise trick” according to the artfully written in-game text. Then come the pop shuvit, kickflip, heelflip and more.\n\nThe controls are easy: one button to ollie. If you’re holding down a shoulder button at the same time, you perform a more involved trick. Beyond the ravishing visuals, what’s most striking is the exquisite fluidity, the delicious “gamefeel”, of the actual skateboarding: the way the knees of this glittering demon bend just the right amount after landing a trick; the way you can see their foot stretching out across the top end of the board in order to apply just the right force that will cause it to flip.\n\nThe vaporwave aesthetic is not Skate Story’s only bold design choice. You will fall many times on the ghoulish asphalt and when you do the action cuts to first-person, causing you to see the world tumbling for what feels like a tormenting eternity. Along the way, you meet a bizarre cast of characters: a mystical rabbit, a pigeon trying to type a screenplay, and a ghost hanging out in a launderette.\n\nThe game’s action can be divided into two types: narrow, linear tunnels that you hurtle through at breakneck speed, and wide-open sandbox levels. The former are furious, momentum-filled thrill rides that demand utmost precision; the latter, set in nightmarish, nocturnal visions of New York, feature many offbeat objectives, such as chasing spooky laundry. In these levels, there is ample room to enjoy the deceptively deep skating mechanics.\n\nGradually, a melancholy surfaces in this crystalline universe. Of course, the skateboarder wants to be free of the underworld, but they also seem enraptured by the idea of devouring these moons. As you thread together tricks with manuals and grinds, scoring ever-larger combos, all as a brilliantly downbeat electro soundtrack chimes away, questions arise. Why is this skateboarder so hungry? Why do they seek pain? In some ways, we’re reminded of the physical risks of skateboarding in real life.\n\nThese questions – and the sadness buried within their answers – distinguish Skate Story from its traditionally zany video game counterparts. Rather, Eng’s gently emotive work is \n\nThe result is a skateboarding game of rare poetry. There is the poetry of the skating itself, the miraculous interplay of body and board rendered with aplomb. There is the actual poetry that accompanies the end of each level. Finally, there are the tender emotions that refract through, and seem amplified by every bailed kickflip in this surreal, shimmering take on hell.",

    "fullText": "on December 8, 2025 at 8:29PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nOver the past several years, the gaming industry has adapted to meet more of the community's needs--something that's evidenced when looking at how many great cross-platform games now exist. While some industry trends have been met with negativity, others have become staples that gamers everywhere have come to enjoy. Cross-play or cross-platform support, allowing players to connect with their friends and other players on different systems from their own, has been a very welcome development. 10 years ago, this feature wasn't present in most titles--now, there are hundreds of games that let you play alongside or against other players regardless of their platform of choice.\n\nCross-platform games are still few and far between in the grand scheme of things, so it might be difficult to discern which have the feature andare worth playing. If you have friends with a different system but want to play together, we've assembled a look at the 33 best cross-platform games you can play right now. This list is in no particular order. Be sure to also check out our lists of the best PS5 games, best Switch games, best Xbox games, and best PC games.\n\nFortnite is the game that popularized the cross-platform feature when it was released back in 2017. More specifically, the battle royale mode that took over the gaming community in the late 2010s featured cross-platform play at a time when platform holders were resistant to the idea. Regardless of if you had a friend on PS4 and you were on PC, you could squad up with them by simply adding their Epic Games ID. Developer Epic Games is responsible for many industry standards we see today, but perhaps its most influential work came with adding the cross-platform feature into Fortnite--something that was initially \"accidentally\" added to the game before being pulled.\n\nCall of Duty has featured cross-platform play for several years at this point, and that didn’t change with the release of Black Ops 7. In addition to Warzone, which continually gets integrated with the mainline series games every year, Black Ops 7 features an extremely seamless cross-platform experience. However, players can choose to only matchmake with other players on the same platform as them, allowing PlayStation and Xbox users to avoid the potential cheating issues on PC. Whichever way you decide to play Call of Duty with your friends, there will always be a title to hop into and plenty to do once you're playing.\n\nSea of Thieves is a late bloomer when it comes to both the gameplay experience and cross-platform functionality. While cross-play has been available between Xbox and PC for years, the game recently came to PS5 and introduced an entirely new crop of players. PS5 users can take full advantage of cross-play and join up with friends on both Xbox and PC. More players getting to hop in and experience Sea of Thieves only bodes well for a game that has become one of the best co-op games on the market.\n\nEA's battle royale darling, Apex Legends, is one of the best free games on Steam and also lets you play with those on any platform. The free-to-play game came out of nowhere in 2019 and offered cross-platform features right out of the gate. Since its release, the Apex community has only gotten stronger and the game has an almost overwhelming amount of content to consume. There are ranked playlists, different battle royale modes, loads of customization, and new non-BR modes being added all the time. You can experience all of that with friends on any available platform.\n\nOne of the more recent additions on this list, Helldivers 2 has been an extremely pleasant surprise in 2024. Featuring extremely fun and inventive gameplay, few current games can match the same level of enjoyment Helldivers 2 offers. While the game's not currently available on Xbox, there's full cross-platform functionality between PS5 and PC. You and up to two friends can spread democracy across the universe, blowing away robots and bugs alike. Working together as a team of three is extremely rewarding, especially when your Stratagems are all working in concert. Friendly fire makes the action all the more chaotic and hilarious.\n\nDestiny 2 has become a live-service behemoth, releasing back in 2017 but still pulling in large numbers of players in 2024. While the cross-platform feature wasn't available at launch in Destiny 2, it has since become one of the game's main selling points. You can play with any friend, anywhere, as the game promotes. There's a little something for everyone in Destiny 2, as you can take part in both PvE and PvP modes, with PvE being the game's strong suit, where activities like raids and dungeons require intense cooperation amongst players. Best of all, though, the base game in Destiny 2 is completely free. You can check out our previous list of the best free games in 2024 as well.\n\nOften referred to as \"car soccer,\" Rocket League is one of the longest-running games on this list. Cross-play was added post-launch, and the way it works has slightly changed over the years, especially after Epic Games acquired developer Psyonix, but the functionality is still as seamless as ever. Rocket League features one of the highest skill ceilings of any multiplayer game on the market, but it's incredibly enjoyable to learn and play. You can experience car soccer for yourself at no charge.\n\nDead by Daylight is an online survival game with some horror elements, but nothing too major that you have to play it with the lights on. The premise of the game is simple, as there's one killer in a lobby with four other players. The killer attempts to, you guessed it, eliminate the four players while the players band together to survive. You can use a myriad of tools and equipment to stop the killer, but the killer has access to some lethal weapons as well. There's cross-play available across all of Dead by Daylight's platforms, and the game is a true treat with a full lobby of friends.\n\nIf you're a fan of cross-platform games, you knew this entry was coming. Minecraft is one of the most successful video games of all time, reaching as far as any game can in the modern world. There are dozens of different ways to play Minecraft, and all of them offer cross-platform functionality. Unfortunately, if you're on PS3 or Xbox 360, you won't get to partake in any cross-play features. The rest of the platforms can join up with anyone else, provided you're all on the same edition of Minecraft. The timeless crafting/survival gameplay lets you adventure with friends, building bases, and exploring limitless worlds.\n\nOverwatch 2 carried over plenty of features from the original game, and cross-play was one of them. Cross-play in Overwatch 2 works exactly as it did in the first game, allowing you to play in a lobby with any other player. This is a great feature for Overwatch 2, as playing as a team is critical due to the interplay between support characters, tanks, and damage dealers. You and your friends can tackle both unranked and ranked playlists as well as other modes that are available with the various in-game seasons. Having everyone pick their hero and work through a map in unison is a terrific feeling.\n\nNBA 2K is another long-running franchise that has featured cross-platform play. Similar to how other online games operate, though, NBA 2K26 only allows cross-platform functionality for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S users. If you're on a last-generation console, PC, or Nintendo Switch 2, you won't have any sort of access to cross-platform features. The game features a revamped hub area, The City, where players can engage with their friends as well as random players in a massive online environment.\n\nBefore No Man's Sky launched, the developers at Hello Games promised that you could run into other players when exploring the vast universe. That initially turned out to be untrue but was eventually corrected following a series of updates as No Man's Sky slowly won back the trust of its community. Now, you can run into other players as well as play with any player, regardless of their platform. Cross-play is terrific in No Man's Sky, as you and some friends can roam the galaxy together, build bases on new planets, take part in intergalactic warfare with other players, and complete quests at various space stations.\n\nAt the height of the pandemic in 2020, certain games became instant phenomenons within the community as everyone was gaming at home. Fall Guys came out at the perfect time, and it just so happened to be one of the more enjoyable and inventive titles of the past few years at the time of its release. A new take on the battle royale genre, you control a bean as you maneuver different obstacle courses and try to be the last player standing in a lobby of 60. You can party up with any player on any platform and compete against them to prove you're the superior gamer.\n\nSpeaking of games that became popular during the pandemic, few games have brought the gaming community together like Among Us did in 2020. Among Us blended strategy and horror with the murder mystery genre to create an experience like few others. You and other players all load into a map, where your main job is to complete various tasks. However, one player has been designated as the impostor, whose job is to blend in and slowly eliminate other players without being caught. Among Us creates some truly hilarious moments, and you can experience it with anyone on any platform, even on mobile.\n\nIt was inevitable that one of the best MMORPGs would make this list, and it's only right that Final Fantasy XIV take the spot. One of the most-respected games in its genre, FFXIV is bursting with content and is still receiving regular expansions and updates. While it does cost money to experience the entire game, you can play the full story plus two expansions at no cost. Moreover, you can meet up with players across all of the available platforms. Whether you're completing quests, exploring new lands, training one of the many jobs, or taking part in combat, there's something for everyone in FFXIV.\n\nDiablo IV has kept a core audience in place with seasonal updates that keep adding content to Sanctuary. The ARPG features a fantastic base game with an enthralling story, interesting characters, and plenty of loot. The class system is also engaging, allowing you to fully shape your character's playstyle and your abilities. Diablo IV features full co-op with up to four players and those players can be from any available platform.\n\nOne of the titles that popularized the \"gacha\" system in games, Genshin Impact is a massive game that's still going strong in 2024. An open-world action-RPG, the title allows you to play as numerous characters and use a wide variety of weapons as you navigate an expansive map. Part of what makes Genshin Impact so popular is the party system, where you can join up on a friend's world and clear Domains or complete quests together. It doesn't matter what system a player is on; if they're playing, you can join their world, provided you're playing on the same Adventure Rank.\n\nThe term cross-play is technically spelled \"Krossplay\" in Mortal Kombat 1, but the feature still does everything you would expect it to do. Support for it was added in early 2024, allowing friends to fight each other in online playlists or private matches. However, cross-platform features aren't available for Nintendo Switch players. Mortal Kombat 1 doesn't reinvent the wheel when it comes to the fighting genre, but it's a highly enjoyable game with a high skill ceiling that's not for the faint of heart.\n\nRacing games aren't as plentiful in the market as they used to be, but it's difficult to beat the experience you can have in Forza Horizon 5. A true graphical marvel, Forza Horizon 5 is an incredible racing game that features a large open world set in a fictional version of Mexico and plenty to do across all the locations. You can unlock a myriad of vehicles, including iconic cars, and race against NPCs or real players. There are also dozens of other game modes to take part in, which you can do so against friends who are on Xbox or PC. It's one of the best games on Game Pass, meaning if you have a subscription, you'll be able to play it without buying it.\n\nThere's really no succinct way to describe what Roblox has evolved into. The game is essentially composed of thousands of other games, all available to download with a few clicks. The genres in Roblox are bountiful, with first-person shooters, RPGs, action-adventure games, strategy games, and more. If you want to take part in any specific game with a friend, all you need to ensure is they have the game properly downloaded. Mobile players can join up with console players and even VR users can create a part for anyone to join.\n\nA newer entry into the FPS genre, The Finals is a high-octane shooter that rewards ingenuity, aggressive gameplay, and accurate shots. You play across arenas that are all completely destructible, making each match feel different from the last depending on what you or others decide to destroy. The core feeling of The Finals is an arcade shooter where the goal is to eliminate enemy players, but it features more replayability than many FPS titles on the market today. You can experience the game in full cross-play with any other player regardless of platform.\n\nBorderlands 4 is the newest entry in the famed looter shooter franchise, and unlike its predecessor, Borderlands 3, the cross-platform features actually function correctly. All platforms feature cross-platform functionality, and the Shift system makes it fairly simple to use. Players just need to make a Shift account and then link it to their system. After that, other players can add you using that account, and then you can join their party to play through Borderlands 4 together. Ideally, most players in your party are roughly the same level, but you can still play with people who are at different parts in the story than you. Keep an eye on our list of Borderlands 4 Shift codes for an extra helping hand in snagging some sweet loot.\n\nChivarly 2 is a first-person action game that takes place in medieval times. You can take part in massive bow-and-arrow and sword-and-shield wars on a battlefield or mount a steed and take a more fast-paced approach to combat. The game takes you through historical battles, letting you live out what it was like for soldiers back in the medieval era. Chivarly 2 is incredibly realistic, allowing you to fight through an excessive amount of damage, and can be played with a friend on any available platform.\n\nWhile Smite might not be the most popular MOBA on the market, it's an enjoyable experience that you can play for free with friends and other players across any available system. Like most MOBAs, Smite features a steep learning curve, as you have to understand each character's abilities and how they work on the map. However, with time, you'll start to master the \"deities\" you enjoy playing as and can take that knowledge into several different game modes. It's also worth noting that Smite 2, the upcoming sequel to Smite, is also going to be cross-platform with the current-gen consoles and PC.\n\nDeep Rock Galactic takes players on a solo or co-op adventure to some of the deadliest mining locations across the galaxy. Players are tasked with clearing out mining sites that are infested with enemies, collecting resources and leveling up their character along the way. Deep Rock Galactic isn't technically classified as a looter shooter, so don't expect weapons and items to fall from the enemies you eliminate. However, there are horror elements and tons of randomized levels to clear out. Deep Rock Galactic supports cross-platform, albeit with some limitations: PS4 and PS5 players can join up together, but PC players need to be on the Xbox Store version of the game to link up with those on Xbox consoles. Users on Steam are limited to playing with other Steam players.\n\nSplit Fiction is the newest co-op adventure from developer Hazelight Studios, the same team behind former Game of the Year Winner It Takes Two. While Split Fiction isn't a sequel to It Takes Two by any means, it takes many of the concepts from the game and cranks them up a notch. You still have to have a partner to play the game, but the Friend's Pass makes it easy to invite any friend you want, regardless of their platform. It allows them to play with you without even buying the game.\n\nIn-game, you and your partner take control of two characters and they try to escape a virtual reality experiment gone wrong. You'll travel to cyberpunk-inspired cities and fantasy lands while engaging with a number of different genres along the way. There's platforming, third-person shooting, vehicle racing, and more awaiting you. It's a terrific experience, earning a rare 10 in GameSpot's Split Fiction review.\n\nThe Monster Hunter series is back with Monster Hunter Wilds. The new installment keeps the same formula in place from previous games in the series, but adds in several fan-requested mechanics, a dynamic world, and updates to combat that can change up your style from fight to fight. Some of the new features include a larger and more interactive map, the ability to ride around on a mount, and a secondary weapon that you can swap to at any time.\n\nThere's no shortage of content in Monster Hunter Wilds, as you can go through a 15-hour campaign and eventually reach the endgame, where dozens of more monsters and quests are awaiting your challenge. One of the best parts of your journey through this content is that you can play with up to three friends during any part of the game. That said, playing with those on other platforms can be unintuitive, so be sure to check out our Monster Hunter Wilds cross-platform explainer for assistance.\n\nMarvel Rivals took the gaming industry by storm at the tail end of 2024, and it's still going strong in 2025. The free-to-play hero shooter utilizes a lineup of nearly 40 Marvel characters that you can use throughout a variety of modes. Each one of these heroes possesses different abilities and has a designated role: Vanguard, Duelist, or Strategist. Every match in Marvel Rivals can only have one of every hero per team, so it's worthwhile to master several characters in case your main gets taken.\n\nAside from the heroes, Marvel Rivals features several maps, casual and ranked modes, and a plethora of events and cosmetics. An important distinction to make with Marvel Rivals is that you can only use cross-platform play in casual modes; ranked modes require you to play with players solely on your platform.\n\nTekken 8 is the first game in the storied franchise to implement any form of cross-platform play. The eighth installment of the long-running series is what fans have come to expect from the fighting game genre. You have access to a huge lineup of fighters that you can use to go through the story mode with or engage in multiplayer fights with online players. There are some quirky game modes as well, such as Tekken Ball, where you're fighting a real opponent but using a beach ball instead of your fists/feet.\n\nAlso, even a year after its release, Tekken 8 is still delivering impactful updates that change the game on the fly. The recent Season 2 update completely changed several different characters to make them stronger, added a new character, and adjusted combat across the board.\n\nThe tactical, first-person shooter genre has started to evolve over the past several years, as games like Valorant have added new spins to change up the formula. FragPunk is the latest game to add a twist on the genre, delivering high-octane gameplay that incorporates both existing and fresh mechanics. Every FragPunk match consists of a team of individual Lancers, who all have unique abilities that need to be purchased through the game's economy system. You can also purchase weapons and equipment with the money you earn throughout the match.\n\nHowever, the major curveball that FragPunk throws is the introduction of Shard Cards. These can be used at the start of a match and implement new twists that every player has to adapt to. Depending on what cards and Lancers are used, matches can play out completely differently. FragPunk delivers cross-platform play across all modes, so you can easily figure out a strategy with your team before each begins.\n\nPath of Exile 2 is an ARPG that plays extremely similarly to something like Diablo IV. You can pick from a variety of different classes that offer completely unique playstyles, abilities, and gear preferences. You'll then enter the world that's cut up into levels and different areas within those levels. Each level contains several bosses, side quests, and a main hub town. The main draw of Path of Exile 2 is its extraordinary class design, which allows you to craft thousands of in-depth character builds using passive and active abilities as well as specific gear. You'll often need to design new builds as you progress the story in PoE 2, as the difficulty curve in-game is something ARPG fans might not be used to. Enemies and bosses can be very tough to defeat, and there's no way to lower your difficulty other than playing in a group with friends so you can maximize your damage output.\n\nAfter a couple of years of waiting, cross-platform play was finally added to Baldur's Gate 3 in one of the game's final updates. You can now play with up to three other players in your party, and all of them can be on different platforms. Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the best RPGs and video games to be released in recent memory. It's a stunning role-playing experience that allows you to fully create a character from scratch or use an existing pre-made character with their own backstory, abilities, and attributes. Once your character is made, you'll embark on an incredible journey that sees you travel through several massive levels, all of which have dozens of characters to meet and interact with, in-depth quests to take on, and secrets to uncover. The combat in Baldur's Gate 3 is turn-based, so if you're not used to that style, you'll have to take some time to understand it. Once you do, though, every combat situation is enthralling as you try to figure out the best strategy to take out enemies with your party and all of their unique characters.\n\nSplit Fiction is a co-op game that requires two players to play; there's no solo option or any form of online matchmaking. This means you have to find a friend who's willing to play with you. Fortunately, Split Fiction is fully cross-platform and only makes one person buy the game, as the Friend Pass allows your buddy to join for free. The other player just has to accept an invite code. From there, you and your partner will start your split-screen adventure in Split Fiction. The game follows two author protagonists as they get entangled in a virtual mess that results in them being stuck in the plot of each other's book ideas. Using co-op mechanics and communication, you and your partner will experience jaw-dropping visuals, hilarious moments, and several side stories that will keep you thoroughly entertained as you work your way through the game. Split Fiction also features some varied combat, vehicles, and plenty of other wacky mechanics that always keep you guessing throughout every level.",
