The original Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater titles were anarchic, arcade fun while the recent return of EA’s beloved Skate franchise offered competent yet jarringly corporate realism. Skate Story, which is mostly the work of solo developer Sam Eng, offers a more impressionistic interpretation while capturing something of the sport’s essential spirit. It transposes the boarding action to a demonic underworld where the aesthetic is less fire and brimstone than glittering, 2010s-era vaporwave. It is also the most emotionally real a skateboarding game has ever felt.\n\nThe premise is ingenious: you are a demon made out of “pain and glass”. Skate to the moon and swallow it, says the devil, and you shall be freed. So that is exactly what you do. You learn to ollie first, a “delicate, precise trick” according to the artfully written in-game text. Then come the pop shuvit, kickflip, heelflip and more.\n\nThe controls are easy: one button to ollie. If you’re holding down a shoulder button at the same time, you perform a more involved trick. Beyond the ravishing visuals, what’s most striking is the exquisite fluidity, the delicious “gamefeel”, of the actual skateboarding: the way the knees of this glittering demon bend just the right amount after landing a trick; the way you can see their foot stretching out across the top end of the board in order to apply just the right force that will cause it to flip.\n\nThe vaporwave aesthetic is not Skate Story’s only bold design choice. You will fall many times on the ghoulish asphalt and when you do the action cuts to first-person, causing you to see the world tumbling for what feels like a tormenting eternity. Along the way, you meet a bizarre cast of characters: a mystical rabbit, a pigeon trying to type a screenplay, and a ghost hanging out in a launderette.\n\nThe game’s action can be divided into two types: narrow, linear tunnels that you hurtle through at breakneck speed, and wide-open sandbox levels. The former are furious, momentum-filled thrill rides that demand utmost precision; the latter, set in nightmarish, nocturnal visions of New York, feature many offbeat objectives, such as chasing spooky laundry. In these levels, there is ample room to enjoy the deceptively deep skating mechanics.\n\nGradually, a melancholy surfaces in this crystalline universe. Of course, the skateboarder wants to be free of the underworld, but they also seem enraptured by the idea of devouring these moons. As you thread together tricks with manuals and grinds, scoring ever-larger combos, all as a brilliantly downbeat electro soundtrack chimes away, questions arise. Why is this skateboarder so hungry? Why do they seek pain? In some ways, we’re reminded of the physical risks of skateboarding in real life.\n\nThese questions – and the sadness buried within their answers – distinguish Skate Story from its traditionally zany video game counterparts. Rather, Eng’s gently emotive work is \n\nThe result is a skateboarding game of rare poetry. There is the poetry of the skating itself, the miraculous interplay of body and board rendered with aplomb. There is the actual poetry that accompanies the end of each level. Finally, there are the tender emotions that refract through, and seem amplified by every bailed kickflip in this surreal, shimmering take on hell.",

    "description": "Over the past several years, the gaming industry has adapted to meet more of the community's needs--something that's evidenced when looking at how many great cross-platform games now exist.

    "fullText": "on December 8, 2025 at 8:29PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nOver the past several years, the gaming industry has adapted to meet more of the community's needs--something that's evidenced when looking at how many great cross-platform games now exist. While some industry trends have been met with negativity, others have become staples that gamers everywhere have come to enjoy. Cross-play or cross-platform support, allowing players to connect with their friends and other players on different systems from their own, has been a very welcome development. 10 years ago, this feature wasn't present in most titles--now, there are hundreds of games that let you play alongside or against other players regardless of their platform of choice.\n\nCross-platform games are still few and far between in the grand scheme of things, so it might be difficult to discern which have the feature andare worth playing. If you have friends with a different system but want to play together, we've assembled a look at the 33 best cross-platform games you can play right now. This list is in no particular order. Be sure to also check out our lists of the best PS5 games, best Switch games, best Xbox games, and best PC games.\n\nFortnite is the game that popularized the cross-platform feature when it was released back in 2017. More specifically, the battle royale mode that took over the gaming community in the late 2010s featured cross-platform play at a time when platform holders were resistant to the idea. Regardless of if you had a friend on PS4 and you were on PC, you could squad up with them by simply adding their Epic Games ID. Developer Epic Games is responsible for many industry standards we see today, but perhaps its most influential work came with adding the cross-platform feature into Fortnite--something that was initially \"accidentally\" added to the game before being pulled.\n\nCall of Duty has featured cross-platform play for several years at this point, and that didn’t change with the release of Black Ops 7. In addition to Warzone, which continually gets integrated with the mainline series games every year, Black Ops 7 features an extremely seamless cross-platform experience. However, players can choose to only matchmake with other players on the same platform as them, allowing PlayStation and Xbox users to avoid the potential cheating issues on PC. Whichever way you decide to play Call of Duty with your friends, there will always be a title to hop into and plenty to do once you're playing.\n\nSea of Thieves is a late bloomer when it comes to both the gameplay experience and cross-platform functionality. While cross-play has been available between Xbox and PC for years, the game recently came to PS5 and introduced an entirely new crop of players. PS5 users can take full advantage of cross-play and join up with friends on both Xbox and PC. More players getting to hop in and experience Sea of Thieves only bodes well for a game that has become one of the best co-op games on the market.\n\nEA's battle royale darling, Apex Legends, is one of the best free games on Steam and also lets you play with those on any platform. The free-to-play game came out of nowhere in 2019 and offered cross-platform features right out of the gate. Since its release, the Apex community has only gotten stronger and the game has an almost overwhelming amount of content to consume. There are ranked playlists, different battle royale modes, loads of customization, and new non-BR modes being added all the time. You can experience all of that with friends on any available platform.\n\nOne of the more recent additions on this list, Helldivers 2 has been an extremely pleasant surprise in 2024. Featuring extremely fun and inventive gameplay, few current games can match the same level of enjoyment Helldivers 2 offers. While the game's not currently available on Xbox, there's full cross-platform functionality between PS5 and PC. You and up to two friends can spread democracy across the universe, blowing away robots and bugs alike. Working together as a team of three is extremely rewarding, especially when your Stratagems are all working in concert. Friendly fire makes the action all the more chaotic and hilarious.\n\nDestiny 2 has become a live-service behemoth, releasing back in 2017 but still pulling in large numbers of players in 2024. While the cross-platform feature wasn't available at launch in Destiny 2, it has since become one of the game's main selling points. You can play with any friend, anywhere, as the game promotes. There's a little something for everyone in Destiny 2, as you can take part in both PvE and PvP modes, with PvE being the game's strong suit, where activities like raids and dungeons require intense cooperation amongst players. Best of all, though, the base game in Destiny 2 is completely free. You can check out our previous list of the best free games in 2024 as well.\n\nOften referred to as \"car soccer,\" Rocket League is one of the longest-running games on this list. Cross-play was added post-launch, and the way it works has slightly changed over the years, especially after Epic Games acquired developer Psyonix, but the functionality is still as seamless as ever. Rocket League features one of the highest skill ceilings of any multiplayer game on the market, but it's incredibly enjoyable to learn and play. You can experience car soccer for yourself at no charge.\n\nDead by Daylight is an online survival game with some horror elements, but nothing too major that you have to play it with the lights on. The premise of the game is simple, as there's one killer in a lobby with four other players. The killer attempts to, you guessed it, eliminate the four players while the players band together to survive. You can use a myriad of tools and equipment to stop the killer, but the killer has access to some lethal weapons as well. There's cross-play available across all of Dead by Daylight's platforms, and the game is a true treat with a full lobby of friends.\n\nIf you're a fan of cross-platform games, you knew this entry was coming. Minecraft is one of the most successful video games of all time, reaching as far as any game can in the modern world. There are dozens of different ways to play Minecraft, and all of them offer cross-platform functionality. Unfortunately, if you're on PS3 or Xbox 360, you won't get to partake in any cross-play features. The rest of the platforms can join up with anyone else, provided you're all on the same edition of Minecraft. The timeless crafting/survival gameplay lets you adventure with friends, building bases, and exploring limitless worlds.\n\nOverwatch 2 carried over plenty of features from the original game, and cross-play was one of them. Cross-play in Overwatch 2 works exactly as it did in the first game, allowing you to play in a lobby with any other player. This is a great feature for Overwatch 2, as playing as a team is critical due to the interplay between support characters, tanks, and damage dealers. You and your friends can tackle both unranked and ranked playlists as well as other modes that are available with the various in-game seasons. Having everyone pick their hero and work through a map in unison is a terrific feeling.\n\nNBA 2K is another long-running franchise that has featured cross-platform play. Similar to how other online games operate, though, NBA 2K26 only allows cross-platform functionality for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S users. If you're on a last-generation console, PC, or Nintendo Switch 2, you won't have any sort of access to cross-platform features. The game features a revamped hub area, The City, where players can engage with their friends as well as random players in a massive online environment.\n\nBefore No Man's Sky launched, the developers at Hello Games promised that you could run into other players when exploring the vast universe. That initially turned out to be untrue but was eventually corrected following a series of updates as No Man's Sky slowly won back the trust of its community. Now, you can run into other players as well as play with any player, regardless of their platform. Cross-play is terrific in No Man's Sky, as you and some friends can roam the galaxy together, build bases on new planets, take part in intergalactic warfare with other players, and complete quests at various space stations.\n\nAt the height of the pandemic in 2020, certain games became instant phenomenons within the community as everyone was gaming at home. Fall Guys came out at the perfect time, and it just so happened to be one of the more enjoyable and inventive titles of the past few years at the time of its release. A new take on the battle royale genre, you control a bean as you maneuver different obstacle courses and try to be the last player standing in a lobby of 60. You can party up with any player on any platform and compete against them to prove you're the superior gamer.\n\nSpeaking of games that became popular during the pandemic, few games have brought the gaming community together like Among Us did in 2020. Among Us blended strategy and horror with the murder mystery genre to create an experience like few others. You and other players all load into a map, where your main job is to complete various tasks. However, one player has been designated as the impostor, whose job is to blend in and slowly eliminate other players without being caught. Among Us creates some truly hilarious moments, and you can experience it with anyone on any platform, even on mobile.\n\nIt was inevitable that one of the best MMORPGs would make this list, and it's only right that Final Fantasy XIV take the spot. One of the most-respected games in its genre, FFXIV is bursting with content and is still receiving regular expansions and updates. While it does cost money to experience the entire game, you can play the full story plus two expansions at no cost. Moreover, you can meet up with players across all of the available platforms. Whether you're completing quests, exploring new lands, training one of the many jobs, or taking part in combat, there's something for everyone in FFXIV.\n\nDiablo IV has kept a core audience in place with seasonal updates that keep adding content to Sanctuary. The ARPG features a fantastic base game with an enthralling story, interesting characters, and plenty of loot. The class system is also engaging, allowing you to fully shape your character's playstyle and your abilities. Diablo IV features full co-op with up to four players and those players can be from any available platform.\n\nOne of the titles that popularized the \"gacha\" system in games, Genshin Impact is a massive game that's still going strong in 2024. An open-world action-RPG, the title allows you to play as numerous characters and use a wide variety of weapons as you navigate an expansive map. Part of what makes Genshin Impact so popular is the party system, where you can join up on a friend's world and clear Domains or complete quests together. It doesn't matter what system a player is on; if they're playing, you can join their world, provided you're playing on the same Adventure Rank.\n\nThe term cross-play is technically spelled \"Krossplay\" in Mortal Kombat 1, but the feature still does everything you would expect it to do. Support for it was added in early 2024, allowing friends to fight each other in online playlists or private matches. However, cross-platform features aren't available for Nintendo Switch players. Mortal Kombat 1 doesn't reinvent the wheel when it comes to the fighting genre, but it's a highly enjoyable game with a high skill ceiling that's not for the faint of heart.\n\nRacing games aren't as plentiful in the market as they used to be, but it's difficult to beat the experience you can have in Forza Horizon 5. A true graphical marvel, Forza Horizon 5 is an incredible racing game that features a large open world set in a fictional version of Mexico and plenty to do across all the locations. You can unlock a myriad of vehicles, including iconic cars, and race against NPCs or real players. There are also dozens of other game modes to take part in, which you can do so against friends who are on Xbox or PC. It's one of the best games on Game Pass, meaning if you have a subscription, you'll be able to play it without buying it.\n\nThere's really no succinct way to describe what Roblox has evolved into. The game is essentially composed of thousands of other games, all available to download with a few clicks. The genres in Roblox are bountiful, with first-person shooters, RPGs, action-adventure games, strategy games, and more. If you want to take part in any specific game with a friend, all you need to ensure is they have the game properly downloaded. Mobile players can join up with console players and even VR users can create a part for anyone to join.\n\nA newer entry into the FPS genre, The Finals is a high-octane shooter that rewards ingenuity, aggressive gameplay, and accurate shots. You play across arenas that are all completely destructible, making each match feel different from the last depending on what you or others decide to destroy. The core feeling of The Finals is an arcade shooter where the goal is to eliminate enemy players, but it features more replayability than many FPS titles on the market today. You can experience the game in full cross-play with any other player regardless of platform.\n\nBorderlands 4 is the newest entry in the famed looter shooter franchise, and unlike its predecessor, Borderlands 3, the cross-platform features actually function correctly. All platforms feature cross-platform functionality, and the Shift system makes it fairly simple to use. Players just need to make a Shift account and then link it to their system. After that, other players can add you using that account, and then you can join their party to play through Borderlands 4 together. Ideally, most players in your party are roughly the same level, but you can still play with people who are at different parts in the story than you. Keep an eye on our list of Borderlands 4 Shift codes for an extra helping hand in snagging some sweet loot.\n\nChivarly 2 is a first-person action game that takes place in medieval times. You can take part in massive bow-and-arrow and sword-and-shield wars on a battlefield or mount a steed and take a more fast-paced approach to combat. The game takes you through historical battles, letting you live out what it was like for soldiers back in the medieval era. Chivarly 2 is incredibly realistic, allowing you to fight through an excessive amount of damage, and can be played with a friend on any available platform.\n\nWhile Smite might not be the most popular MOBA on the market, it's an enjoyable experience that you can play for free with friends and other players across any available system. Like most MOBAs, Smite features a steep learning curve, as you have to understand each character's abilities and how they work on the map. However, with time, you'll start to master the \"deities\" you enjoy playing as and can take that knowledge into several different game modes. It's also worth noting that Smite 2, the upcoming sequel to Smite, is also going to be cross-platform with the current-gen consoles and PC.\n\nDeep Rock Galactic takes players on a solo or co-op adventure to some of the deadliest mining locations across the galaxy. Players are tasked with clearing out mining sites that are infested with enemies, collecting resources and leveling up their character along the way. Deep Rock Galactic isn't technically classified as a looter shooter, so don't expect weapons and items to fall from the enemies you eliminate. However, there are horror elements and tons of randomized levels to clear out. Deep Rock Galactic supports cross-platform, albeit with some limitations: PS4 and PS5 players can join up together, but PC players need to be on the Xbox Store version of the game to link up with those on Xbox consoles. Users on Steam are limited to playing with other Steam players.\n\nSplit Fiction is the newest co-op adventure from developer Hazelight Studios, the same team behind former Game of the Year Winner It Takes Two. While Split Fiction isn't a sequel to It Takes Two by any means, it takes many of the concepts from the game and cranks them up a notch. You still have to have a partner to play the game, but the Friend's Pass makes it easy to invite any friend you want, regardless of their platform. It allows them to play with you without even buying the game.\n\nIn-game, you and your partner take control of two characters and they try to escape a virtual reality experiment gone wrong. You'll travel to cyberpunk-inspired cities and fantasy lands while engaging with a number of different genres along the way. There's platforming, third-person shooting, vehicle racing, and more awaiting you. It's a terrific experience, earning a rare 10 in GameSpot's Split Fiction review.\n\nThe Monster Hunter series is back with Monster Hunter Wilds. The new installment keeps the same formula in place from previous games in the series, but adds in several fan-requested mechanics, a dynamic world, and updates to combat that can change up your style from fight to fight. Some of the new features include a larger and more interactive map, the ability to ride around on a mount, and a secondary weapon that you can swap to at any time.\n\nThere's no shortage of content in Monster Hunter Wilds, as you can go through a 15-hour campaign and eventually reach the endgame, where dozens of more monsters and quests are awaiting your challenge. One of the best parts of your journey through this content is that you can play with up to three friends during any part of the game. That said, playing with those on other platforms can be unintuitive, so be sure to check out our Monster Hunter Wilds cross-platform explainer for assistance.\n\nMarvel Rivals took the gaming industry by storm at the tail end of 2024, and it's still going strong in 2025. The free-to-play hero shooter utilizes a lineup of nearly 40 Marvel characters that you can use throughout a variety of modes. Each one of these heroes possesses different abilities and has a designated role: Vanguard, Duelist, or Strategist. Every match in Marvel Rivals can only have one of every hero per team, so it's worthwhile to master several characters in case your main gets taken.\n\nAside from the heroes, Marvel Rivals features several maps, casual and ranked modes, and a plethora of events and cosmetics. An important distinction to make with Marvel Rivals is that you can only use cross-platform play in casual modes; ranked modes require you to play with players solely on your platform.\n\nTekken 8 is the first game in the storied franchise to implement any form of cross-platform play. The eighth installment of the long-running series is what fans have come to expect from the fighting game genre. You have access to a huge lineup of fighters that you can use to go through the story mode with or engage in multiplayer fights with online players. There are some quirky game modes as well, such as Tekken Ball, where you're fighting a real opponent but using a beach ball instead of your fists/feet.\n\nAlso, even a year after its release, Tekken 8 is still delivering impactful updates that change the game on the fly. The recent Season 2 update completely changed several different characters to make them stronger, added a new character, and adjusted combat across the board.\n\nThe tactical, first-person shooter genre has started to evolve over the past several years, as games like Valorant have added new spins to change up the formula. FragPunk is the latest game to add a twist on the genre, delivering high-octane gameplay that incorporates both existing and fresh mechanics. Every FragPunk match consists of a team of individual Lancers, who all have unique abilities that need to be purchased through the game's economy system. You can also purchase weapons and equipment with the money you earn throughout the match.\n\nHowever, the major curveball that FragPunk throws is the introduction of Shard Cards. These can be used at the start of a match and implement new twists that every player has to adapt to. Depending on what cards and Lancers are used, matches can play out completely differently. FragPunk delivers cross-platform play across all modes, so you can easily figure out a strategy with your team before each begins.\n\nPath of Exile 2 is an ARPG that plays extremely similarly to something like Diablo IV. You can pick from a variety of different classes that offer completely unique playstyles, abilities, and gear preferences. You'll then enter the world that's cut up into levels and different areas within those levels. Each level contains several bosses, side quests, and a main hub town. The main draw of Path of Exile 2 is its extraordinary class design, which allows you to craft thousands of in-depth character builds using passive and active abilities as well as specific gear. You'll often need to design new builds as you progress the story in PoE 2, as the difficulty curve in-game is something ARPG fans might not be used to. Enemies and bosses can be very tough to defeat, and there's no way to lower your difficulty other than playing in a group with friends so you can maximize your damage output.\n\nAfter a couple of years of waiting, cross-platform play was finally added to Baldur's Gate 3 in one of the game's final updates. You can now play with up to three other players in your party, and all of them can be on different platforms. Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the best RPGs and video games to be released in recent memory. It's a stunning role-playing experience that allows you to fully create a character from scratch or use an existing pre-made character with their own backstory, abilities, and attributes. Once your character is made, you'll embark on an incredible journey that sees you travel through several massive levels, all of which have dozens of characters to meet and interact with, in-depth quests to take on, and secrets to uncover. The combat in Baldur's Gate 3 is turn-based, so if you're not used to that style, you'll have to take some time to understand it. Once you do, though, every combat situation is enthralling as you try to figure out the best strategy to take out enemies with your party and all of their unique characters.\n\nSplit Fiction is a co-op game that requires two players to play; there's no solo option or any form of online matchmaking. This means you have to find a friend who's willing to play with you. Fortunately, Split Fiction is fully cross-platform and only makes one person buy the game, as the Friend Pass allows your buddy to join for free. The other player just has to accept an invite code. From there, you and your partner will start your split-screen adventure in Split Fiction. The game follows two author protagonists as they get entangled in a virtual mess that results in them being stuck in the plot of each other's book ideas. Using co-op mechanics and communication, you and your partner will experience jaw-dropping visuals, hilarious moments, and several side stories that will keep you thoroughly entertained as you work your way through the game. Split Fiction also features some varied combat, vehicles, and plenty of other wacky mechanics that always keep you guessing throughout every level.",
